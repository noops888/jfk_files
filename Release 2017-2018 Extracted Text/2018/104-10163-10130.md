1 Information Received from AMBIDDY=1

REFERENCE: (A) HNMA-4315, 17 April 1969
(B) HNMA-432%, 1 May 1969

1. Attached (USC) for the information of Headquarters is a
sory of a memorandum prepared for the LNPURE Chief on 12 May 1969.
This mezorandum sets forth information rece: ved that day by the

AMBIDDY-1 who is considering going into a dry dock venture
in Corinto with Jose Maria ZELAYA, private secretary to President
Somoza. ZELAYA has cabinet rank. He is believed by many to
pro-Communist although, as in the caze of similar reports about
Francisco J. LAINEZ, no real proof of these allegations seems to
be produced.

2. When shown this memorandum, the LNPURE Chief said he
thought it quite likely that ZELAYA is strongly anti-American
as reported by AMBIDDY.

3. AMBIDDY says that for the first time he recently heard
Somoza utter unfavorable words about the United States and
AMBIDDY “wondered” if ZELAYA could be exerting some
evil influence on Somoza.

a will seek to draw AMBIDDY out at length on
this matter at an opportune time.

Political Attaché '
Statements of Jose Maria “Chema” ZELAYA

1. % 12 May I was contacted by a close friend of mine
who is engagec in negotiations with "Chema" ZELAYA which
may lead to the twe forming a business partnership. ‘hile t
my source is not normally a source of intelligence informae
tion, I have found him to be a good observer and to be :
reliable. told me that ZELAYA told him the following
at a meeting on 9 May. 7 af
i .

a 2. The ROCKEFCLLER visit is merely a political maneuver :
_ On the part of President NIXON to furnish an excuse if
anything goes wrong in Latin America. It is preposterous
to expect Governor ROCKEFELILER to learn anything about a Z i:
eount: in twenty four hours. ROCKEFELLER will go back to i
the United States, make his report to NIXON, and then go about
his.normal duties, NIXON will adopt those recommendations

vegarding U.S. policy for Latin America that are agreeable
| to him, paying no attention to the rest. If anything goes
| wrong, NIXON can pin the blame on ROCKEFELLER. In thir way

'
Rea

he has a scapegoat and also has an opportunity to lessen the
>... prestige of a potential political rival. Wo possible good can
come from this mission.

3. ZELAYA said that he has managed to obtain the blessing
(bendicién) of the Catholic Church. Now he is working on
the blessing of the American Ambassador, In this respect he.
has proposed setting up youth centers around the country--
places where youngeters can go to read pood books, play
ping pong, etc. -- and the American Ambassador is interested.

4. My friend is of ths opinion that ZELAYA is strongly
anti-American. _

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa

Ue On 18 April I saw Subject again briefly and
told him that I would appreciate an opportunity to talk
to him alone, As he was about to leave town, he
pronised to contact me again on his next trip to Managua.
je phoned me on 28 ‘April. I picked him up that night
and drove him up to my house where we had.a long conversae
tion over a couple of steaks and a good bottle of wine.

2. .I told Subject that I had heard his. name mentioned
in connection with such unsavory activity as fomenting
revolution in Panama and narcotics trafficking--from people
whe don't know him. My reply to any auch Sineycnouthing
dg that Subject is a hyperactive type who keeps in contact
with all sorte of people, some of whom may be involved in
unsavory activity. This does not mean Subject is involved.
Indeed, I was sure he was note

$. ‘The provocation yielded desired resulte and, in)
the ensuing conversation Subject gave me a detailed
explanation of his present activities and financial situaticr.

&, His business dealings are carried on under:his a
company, known as Central. South International, Ine. Ha is:
sident and his wife is secretary. Hia business activity

‘Ss
Nicaragua consists of

a. Sales of equipment to tha National Guard

», Sales .of Livestock (sews) to Nicaragua. These
dealings ars handled theough Colonel Guillerme
NOGUERA, the buyer at this and, Subject
expects to expand this business to inelude sales’
to INFONAC--tne Naticral Development Commission.

Subject obtaine the Livestock from th
Montura Ranch of Florida. :

e. Sales of Florida real estate.
Subject is not licensed to make such sales
in the U.S, but can sell to persons abroad.
(About two years ago he was selling lots
west of Miami near where a new airport is
to be built.) 7

$. Subject is now involved--on thie tripe-in a deal
with President SOMOZA to furnish well drilling and pumping
equipment for an agricultural irrigation system. SOMOZA
was approaches. by a British firm which somehow wangled a U.S.
inteed § 1/2 percent loan.to underwrite the same scheme.
8 low interest was better than Sudjeet"s contacts could
obtain initially and it appeared that the contract would
go to the British outfit. Howevery Subject's stateside
partner, a South Carolina legislator (etate leval), who
operates a business known as INTERGROW, managed to swing
game deal and was due in town on 28 April to talk with
SOMOZA. SOMOZA told Subject he would give the business to
Subject if he and his INTERGROW friend could equal the British .
offer. As of 28 April prospects for coneumation of a deal
eoked good.

6. Subject is also trying to work out a deal with
SOMOZA regarding export of Nicaraguan meat. Previous
dealings with a man from S6W fell through when thie chap
tried to "go around" Subject by dealing direct with Nicaraguan
meat exporters. At present Subject ia dealing with SOMOZA
to buy meat from CARNIC and IFAGAN to a@1] in Miami to
the Northwestern Meat Company, owned by ELpidio NUREZ. In
return for his cooperation in the meat business, SOMOZA is
to be given a 38% slice of the profita, The remainder would
be split up as follows: 16% to Edgarda BUTTARI, 13% to
Frank CONDOM, and 33% to Subject. SOMOSA is trying to
figure ouc some way to get his bite without paying U.S.
income taxes so the matter of spreading the profits is still
up in the air. Central South international ite. has an
account at the Capital National Bank of Miami; Subject showed
me an irrevacable letter of credit in the amount of $48,000
issued by this bank to be used for the meat export deal.

7 As for possible sales of cattle to INFONAC, .
Subject is working on a deal with SOMOZA which may
involve as much as a million and a half dollars.

8. Subject lives on commissions. He is now in
debt to the tune of $9,500 of which he owes $1,600 to
American Express and $3,900 to SOMOZA. When he has been
down and out three persons have helped him with handouts
of money to tide him ove: These are Sixto MESA, in
the construction business in Miami; Jose Luis GONZALEZ,
in the lumber business; and “Tacho" SOMOZA. Subject plans
to pay back all three every cent they have given him. He
considers these handouts as loans. He is now trying
to consolidate his debts through.a loan from Diners Club.
He is paying on his home mortgage at a rate of 5 3/4 percent,
quite low by present-day standards. Two Cuban Negro friends
of many-years standing live with him at his home. . They
are taxi drivers and each pays $25 a week to help defray
household costs. One of these loyal retainers fired the
firs hot during the Pilon sugar mill raid pulled off by
Subject's followers several years ago.

9. Contrary to popular belief, Subject does not own
a piece of the Vizcaya restaurant in Miami although he
eould have been a partner had he made a $500 investment
when the enterprise began. The owners are Oscar VILA,
Aramis PINON, and the cook, named Tomfs (inu). VILA
and PINON were with Subject in the Bay of Pigs invasion
and both are old friends. VILA has been rumored involved
in narcotics but Subject doesn't think he is. Some time
ago the Miami Herald sent its lady gourmet reporter to do a
story on the Vizcaya. She found it to her liking and wrote
a favorable story but some unidentified character at the
Herald told her that narcotics were pushed at the Vizcaya
and that Subject was one of the owners. Publisher KNIGHT
of the Herald had an investigation run before allowing the
gourmet reporter's story to. be printed. The restaurant
was given a clean bill of health and the story was run.

26. One of tha persons most prominently involvad in
blackening Subject's name is Rolando MASFERRER. Subject
classifies him as the scum of Batista's Cuba. One gets the
impression that Subject would be unhappy if MASFERRER, who

- Subject says has been involvad in narcotics trafficking,

were to say anything good about him,

Rapa eerste


oho

ll. Subject's. only other possible connection with
narcotics involves a report he gave to Mr. DREW of the
FBI. This was as follows: Subject has a friend named
Carlos ARMAS who is skipper of a shrimp boat the “Sea
Cat". ARMAS lives at 1800 NW 34th Street, Miami. At sea
in British waters (around some British island or cay in the
Caribbean). ARMAS has "fraternized" with a Cuban shrinper
“El Costero" captained by Antonio LOPEZ, LOPEZ has told
ARMAS that his boat,"E£l Costero", often carries aboard a
mall, very fast speedboat. While anchored in Sritish waters
this speedboat, with a crew of 3, is put overboard with a
"package" on board. It sigappears only to return sometime
later minus the package but with large quantities of monay.
It then refuelas from "El Costero" and heads for Cuba on its
own power. Subject and ARMAS think it probable that the
package contains narcotics and that Fidel CASTRO is raising
money this way. Mr. DREW of the FBI told Subject to tell
his story to the Coast Guard, Subject did but the CG said
they were not interested because the smuggling was taking
place in British waters, As far as Subject knows nothing has 1
ever been done about this matter.

a

12. Subject says that “politically” his program breaks
tor

a. Keeping about 200° men ("my action men") ready
fer action in case of a sudden change in Cuba
or a “go ahead" on raids against Cuba.

_ Be Keeping on good terms with Edgardo. BUTTARI and-
Frank CONDOM who are both on good terms with
"Bebe" REBOZO who is in turn, an intimate
friend of President NIXON. (Subject asked me
not to discuss or report this owing to its
political sensitivity. It would seem prudent
Rot to accentucts this matter).

@e Keeping gcod relations with Nicaragua and
Haiti for possizie future operations against
Cuba.

13. I asked Subject if he had any dealings with colcnel

ies : MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manuel ARIME Buesa -

1. ARTIME comes to Managua frequently, always using ‘ hi
LANICA Airlines and frequently flying over Cub. He is
aware of the puasibility of a highjacxing and se that he
would never make it cut of the Havana airport alive if
the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him,

2.° He explains his trips as legitimate business.
One of his enterprises lies in obtaining fatigue uniforms,
eanteens, web gear, and similar equipment and supplies
for the Nicaraguan National Guard. Another enterprise,
in which he was involved a year or so ago, involved lumber
and cabinet woods which he hoped to export from Nicaragua
to the States. He dealt with a Nicaraguan businessman
named MOLINA in this matter. It seems to have fallen through.
At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME was trying
to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in
Germany here. I have heard no more about this. A more
recent line is Nicaraguan beef. for export to the States.
He says that he has made contact with the top man of the.
8 & W restaurants in the States, This man, after checking
eamples of Nicaraguan beef, says he will buy all -he can get.
‘The supplier at thi -end would be CARNIC, a meat packing
enterprise owned by President SOMOZA. . (There is. no doubt’
-  ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may
_ pe stymied by the import quotas, especially since Nicaragua
over-exported to the States in 1968 and had troubles as a
* result.
3. ARTIME drops by to see me at my home often although

“ not on avery trip, Mis vidits to we have been less frequent
of late. We have easy rapport. He knows who I represent.

elesest friend in Nicaragua. ARTIME 6ften stays at his

i home. On a couple of occasions APTIME has been by to

ABLANEDO,who used to live at £1 Bluff on the Cast Coast.

: : : 7 "El Gallego" ABLANEDO now. lives in Managua‘and makes his

living renting cut dump trucks and construction and hauling

equipment. On one occasion ARTIME came by with a Cuban I

believe was named VILA. Mirta PADRON, another mutual

Cuban friend (she teaches Spanish at the American Embassy)

tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in Miami-but that

ARTIME has no. connection with this enterprise. A couple.

of times ARTIME.has come by with Frank CONDOM, @& short,

uiet, red-faced Cuban who owns some jewelry stores in

Hiani’ CONDOM is now pretty well-off financially and is

@ good friend and business associate of "Babe" REBOZO,

Hho) in turn, is a close friend of President NIXON. I

belie

ve CONDOM and, perhaps REBOZO, may be involved in the
meat deal.

%.. ARTIME always comes with sorsone when he visits
meeenot because he feels need for a bodyguard as some
suspect, but simply because he still doesn't know how to
drive a car and I live some distance out of town. Our
‘visite are pleasant, involve a scotch or two at most.
The last two times ARTIME.has not had anything, to drink.
We talk no operations or other suzh business. My personal
views on dealing with CASTRO, especially on howwe should
have dealt with him in the paat, are rather hawkish and I

7 ARTIME finds these views pleasant to his ear although
he is well aware that they are not "policy."

& ARTIME told me some months ago--before the elections--
of mecting with "Bebe" REBOZO, The meeting was arranged
through CONDOM. ARTIME has not claimed te me to have met with
Mr. NIXON either before or after he assumed the presidency.
He has made it known, as is already well known, that REBCZO
’s close tc the Tresident. He has aiso speculated that c
REBOZO tight have considerable say in formulation of the new

| adninistration's Cuban policy. He expects this polic;

to ve more hard-line cut has. aot specifically said that
RE30ZO0 has said this would be so. Ye recently told me

that sme of my ideas on enforcing the economic blockade
had been passed on to REBOZO.

6. In response to my queries as to what direction
the new Cuba policy might take, ARTIME said in March 1969
that he did not expect the NIXON administration to address
itself to the Cuban problem before “ay of this year.
Then he expects a concerted effort to make the economic
blockade work. If that does not yield results, he expects
that a go-ahead will be given for the resumption of Cuban
exile raids against Cuba from non-U.S. bases. He hopes to
be the man chosen to lead in this endeavor. Again, in
res] se to. my questions, he said that exiles could ba
trained in Nicaragua. He favors using Haiti as the actual
base of operations, i.e., the raiding parties would leave:
from there. He mentioned having talked with President
DUVALIER and indicated that he has DUVALIER's approval for
such operations.

7. ARTIME said that operations against Cuba would be
@esigned to knock out shipping and port facilities. He
has not recently referred to his earlier invasion plan

as outlined 23 October 1968.

8. ARTIME is still. as charming ao ever, lot's of fun
tobe around socially--full of jokes, anecdotes, etc.
He has not lost faith, is one of the few of what have been.
termed elsewhere "the old exile hacks" who have not given
up. He really does seem determined to play a leading role
in unseating CASTRO. he is beginning to go to fat a bit.
ZI saw him in a bathing suit not long ago and thought that
he would do well 'to get into trim if he hopes to lead in
any military operation.

9. ARTIME has never made any discernable efforts to
secrets from. me; indeed, he sews to have taken special,
not te do so. He is mature and quite objective--car

gee various facets to just abeut any problem. I believe

it ie well worthwhile maintaining engasional contact with
him.

¢ Current Rumors in PBRUMEN Exile Community
er aD iE

RE Ton

mate 008 eotems,

1, As usual the first month of 1969 featured a large number of rumors
making the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile community. While we normally tend
to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they
relate to GPVALIANT.

2. The first of these rumors deals with a_new group which has pre-
sumably been formed for the purpose of tryi through Gl
Among those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos,
Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari. This group reportedly meets every Thurs-
day at different houses: The last meeting in January was held at the home
of Lincoln Rodon. At this meeting Prio presumably stated that Butari was
a better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando. The general
consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business
partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT.
‘The rumor mill has it that the.group intends to pretend that it Savors
political and democratic solutions to’the PBRUMEN problem but that they
really seck armed intervention. In this same connection Father O'Farril
has recently told AMPALM-4 that AMBIDDY-1 is once more connected with WOFIRM
and that AMCORE-2 has joined him.. The rumor mill says. further that AMBIODY-1
and AMCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit
encouragement of the-above group. According to AMPALM-4 O'Farril himself
does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-1 and AMCORE-2 wanting to estab-
Mish training camps. O'Farril feels that the solution AMBIDDY-1 is looking
for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.

3. WIBALDA has picked up information quite similar to that learned ~

h AMPALM-4, He also has reported the existence of this group and
said that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy arms
‘and equipment to ovezinrow AMTHUG-1. According to WIBALDA important wem-
bers of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor, and Ortodoxos are in-
volved even though these organizations themselves are not participating
a8 groups in the aovennt. *

4. Another rumor has it that AMOTEK-59 is also conspiring in
plans for future armed action against PBRUMEN.

S. The sbove information is being forwarded strictly as unfounded
and unconfirmed rors. ke are passing it along only because it represeats
another indication of what the exiles are expecting from GPVALIAST. We
find the rumor concerning AMBIDOY-1 particularly interesting and suspect
that it may be an outgrowth of the recent report we have received fros
AMCHALK-1 that AMBIDDY-1 has been contacted by ACSI.

with AMBIDDY-1 the “intelligence net" mentioned by the reference.
The state: position was "we are happy to maintain con-

tact with you and to discuss this matter from time to tine on an
informal and personal basis, but the policy of our organization :
ia that we do not engage in intelligence activities in a friendly ‘
country except in coordination with the local government.
Therefore, even though you asgure us that General SOMOZA knows
and approves this activity, we would have to have a direct rae
quest from him before we could cooperate with you in any kind

of an official mpacity." ‘This appears to. have sufficied to keep
our lines open to those involved without committing ua to de
anything more than listen,

@ péd@age in which he tells me that he intends to leave Cuba

Of course, he is referring to the Airlift from Habana to Miami.
1 ask you to inform me if you can do anything in this regard as I
think it is the last chance my parents have of leaving.

4 Please tell me if it is certain that Fidel intends to go
to EXPO 67 in Canada for the 26 of July as it has been rumored.
If he is going, I would like to know if Commander Vallejo will go
with him as his chief doctor. When I was imprisoned, I receiv:
many messages from Vallejo telling me that he was not a Communist

Dear {
Pardon ay lateress in writing to you but I have had to face
many problems and I wanted to be calm when I wrote to you,

'

Twas at Luis Somoza's funeral and I think that I made a good 1

dmpression, I am at present nore worried than! was before, but not
for my future, because Tacho is & very good friend of mine and Luis

Was not. I am worried about Nicaragua's destiny, Let us tut
forget that Nicaragua is the most solid pillar of Central america.
InLaines grew closer to Tacho during the funeral, Laines took
Practically all the load d@ the funeral arrangements upon himself,
S-lany of the good men who gave the Sonoza's advice were intimate
‘friends of Luis and they are afraid of coming to Tacho in order to
Give him advice.

3-The Communists are avare of this and they aré also aware of the
fact that Tacho ts even sere violent than Luis, therefore, they take
advantage of the situation to provoke Tacho, thereby hoping that

without Luis's advisors and possibly with the “bad advice" of "an

Z he will begin

with an iron hand, which is juat what the Communists Want from hin.

in a great quantity ‘of weapons into Nicaragua, The weapons have
Ret been found, in spite cf the investigations by the Security Corpa;
even General Montiel recognizes this.

6-Tthink that there is discontent in the young cfficor's ranks

" because of the low salaries which the officials, sub-officisls and
"| (QHBXXHEE enlisted men receive. This is Rot a problem at tho present

but it could develop into a problem, if the Communists exploit

it ekillfully.

%-I also think that the Security Corps which continues to function

under the orders of Montiel, who is also chief of Staff and also

@ werchant, loses all its efficiency because of the fect that Montiel

cannot dedicate sufficient time to the Corps and as a result leaves

its direction to Captain Willop, who I think is entirely incompetent i ‘

for the job. HHA

S-I think that the only good thing that panorama has is the loyalty \ t

of General Sonosa‘s military troops, for I honestly do not trust i

ome of the high officials.

S-Jose Fernandes made the contact with the Nicaraguan gir) who

received the proposition to study on a scholarship in Russia, at i

the Patricio Lumumba University, and ehe is willing to collaborate i

with us. I gave the contact to Carlos. |

going to try to intensify their '"infiltrative job" in the Kicaragian

The following is expected after 2 May, the day on which Tacho is

ll-I sincerely think, and excuse ne, that the United States should

now, due i. the psychological state in which Tacho is in, demonstrate
a that they have confidence in him XX and in the success of his i
i Government, He is grateful to the United States for the help

which the United States sent to ni go that he could save his
brother, therefore take advantage of thia.

MIAMI; 3 April 1967 +

Dear[__]

Pardon wy lateness in writing, but I have had to run around

a lot, The fundamental subjects which I wished to discuss
are

1. I was displeased when our Nicaraguan friend discussed
the subject of the implements which we had in Blueffield
with General Somoza before I had discussed anything with

hin (Genral Somoza); above all without even consulting
with me before he went ahead and did it, this put me in
a difficult. position with the Government. This is what I

(a) The com help me gee Lae @) If wilt
tell Somoza ey Weg teh (c) I move them to

enother place which is less accessible. - le agreed with

discussed with Carlos:

we on consulting with the company, and the answer he gave
to (b) was that ZHH he planted the "other friend" in with
Somoza, and nothing else was said, Thank God tmt I did

. Wall on that job, and I did pass some unpleasant moments.

2.During Somozas'. stay in the USA I have seen him frequently

: and I have taken American investors, who wish to put their
" enpital to work in Nicaragua, to.scee him, We have conversed

sopiously about his projects, He wants to do the following:
Turn over his power when his mandate is terminated. Raise

* the standard of living for the Nicaraguans. Give the

farmers the chance to take their Products to big markets,

through the construction of highways, silos to store graing

and favorable legislation for the small farmers, the
only thing that worries me is the extraordinary influence

that "Che Lainez" has on him in economics. There are

diverse comentaries about this individual on whether he is
. & Bember of the Communist Party or not; but the truth is
; (I know him Personally) that he is a social outcast,
ry intelligent and very ambitious,

bitter,
& Furthermore, when

he tries to please someone he acts. like their servant. 12

: he is not a Communist then he is easy material for the

; Communists.

“8.

Somoza has promised me to continue to move the subject
of Cuba in the international “spheres, and in his

appearance

-3-

The consul has now tol4 x3 that Duvalier wishes to speak
with me. I told him that I would be glad to speak with him
when he wished and when the interview would be kept secret.
I think that this interview could be useful, for I have
found that the Haitian Government has a grudge against the
U.S. I do not know what we will speak about but I think
that I can get some good information for you (plural).

8. I think that we can expect violent revolts in Nicaragua,
in Panama, in Guatemala, and in Honduras (the opposition is..~
in possession of many arms that have not been found yet).
This breakout.of guerrilla warfare in Bolivia and Brasil
demonstrates Fidel's desperate strategy in trying to

start other Vietnams in America whether or not Russia is
‘4m agreement. Z

I think that the dismissal ot Raul Castro-and Vilma Espin
from the key posts in Cuban Communism can cause en internal
‘Fevolt in disagreement between Cuban Communist elements and

@ have to be on alert in order to take advantage of the

“event so that it will not surprise as the "blocdy rebellion

Planting distrust in the Armed Forces and on making Fidel
Castro appear unstable as a person. If he has not even

“."yeen faithful to his ow "brother," then what can the rest
of them expect if they are not even his relatives? { think

~- that we should emphasize the fundamental part that Roul and

Vilma had in. consolidation ef Castroiaa and its rise to power.



a ~— SEerer 7

ate

I do not think that Almeida has the control nor the ‘

Anfluence over the Army that Raul had, and therefore a i

conspiracy and revolt of the Armed Forces is easier, f s

There is no doubt ti.at Fidel is assigning key posts to

men and women who are his personal friends, without

regard to whethsr they are good or bad Communists. This

ig going to bring ab-ut problems with the old guard of the
Communist Party and with the people in the new guard who have

been hastily taught Fidel's doctrine but have received
Goumunist indoctrination (many of them sympathize with Raul).
It seems that Russia is very displeased with Fidel and

it would not surprise me if Russia would try to cause an
attack on him; we should inainuate this in the propaganda
against Castro for we know that his paranoic mentality and
his @isgust for Russia would wost emphatical ly make him :
‘@tart to purify and take repriuals against Moscow's unconditional

Dear 3

dust a few lines to report the following:
‘2, Y believe that Communism will concentrate on Nicaragua as
&@ point of attack.
2. The mon who have returned to Nicaragua after receiving
: training ‘tn Cuba only acted indirectly in the bloody events
of the 32nd, because according to information gathered in
Sicaragua through “Pepe Fernandes," the “gandinistaa” coumunists
(aho follow the Castro line) were avaiting the assassination
"ef the Somcza in Leon and this was never realized (carried
cut). These men were expecting an outbreak before-Tacho
Senoza took over the Presides:y of the Republic.
3. van structuriag (building) an anticommunist intelligence ~
net in Nicaragua, which I have begun to instruct (train).
This net 4s composed of: Jose Fernandez ("Pepe" Ferndndez)
Manager of Casa Hook. Rodolfo Jerez, Owner of casa "Venus."
Capitalist of various enterprises. : :
Orlando Castrillo - Studies law, 5th year (5?) year of age
He has a grocery (foodstuffs) business.
Duilio Cabrera - Studies law, 4th year, Works in the Ministry
of Agriculture, in the Department of Live Stock. He is 25

years old. *



Roberto Arellano ~ Studies law, 5th year. He works in the
Mational Palace. Department of (Providad?). It is a positios

related to employees and workers. He is 28 years of ag>.
Roberto Arias - Studies law, 6th year. Owner of an auto~ : 7
mobile spare parts business.

These individuals are going to create an anticommun‘st
intelligence net. I have already given them one week of
conferences.

4. According to reports received by Pepe, a Nicaraguan naned
Gustavo Gomes Mesa, acquired through various subjects (persons),
about $5,000.00 in arms in Miami, from the Tamiami Gun Ghop.
The money was contributed by Aguirre, the owner. of "Diario
de ins Anericas" (and director), through an individual named.
German Arellano, These arms were going to be infiltrated into

; Nicaragua in small quantities at a time.

: &. Today I received from Adolfo Jiménez (old chief of the

Camp "Francisco" of communications, of Costa Rica) the pro-
a position to ask Nicaragua for permision to launch: the invasion
from there to Haiti.  Accord.3¢ to him thers is a-grou7 of
>, Capitalists in New York who are willing to send from Europe

* about $80,000.00 in arms, to any designated location in
‘Wicaragua. I am attempting to find out the names of these
: capitalists so that I can report it. I have. replied that I
gill think the proposition over very cautiously before pre=
wonting it te Nicaragua. Of course, I will not get involved

ots dn thie adventure unless you desire the contrary.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: © Termination of Manuel Artime Bues:

@ f\

1. On the night of 13 Aaguary 1967 the writer using
the operational alias James &, ilson met with Artime in a
room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida. The purpose
of the meeting was to formally terminate Artime's association
with the Agency. This involved the obtaining of termination y t
Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover :
the final periodical payment through 31 December 1966 and
obtaining outstanding receipts.

2, The meeting was cordial and all paper work involved
in the proceedings was accomplished without incident. There
was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had
done (or tried to do) for the Agency in the past and an un-
doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that he was ready

and willing for any task he might be called upon to do in
the future.

aces

3. Artime made only one request--a rather passionate
one--for financial assistance for the immediate family members
of two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR)
members who were executed #3 the result of operational missions
to Cuba and the wife of anviher who is serving a 30-year
sentence. (It will be recalled that Artime has been furnishing
receipts for the $3,000 he has been receiving in. recent months
claiming that the money goes to the families of MRR members
who have lost their lives or been imprisoned while on MRR
missions.) We are examining these. three cases and if worthy
will arrange for financial benefits under the "survivors and
martyrs" section of the ANBUD activity.

4. Artime has a sterile Headquarters telepho~e number
and a P.O. box addresa in Week ton, D.C. He was not *scouraged
in maintaining a locsa contact by telephone or correspondence
if he had any items of interest to pass along and was assured
that if he ever haa any “new” ideas, if he put them in writing,
they would be studied. It was, however, made very clear to
him thet his formal association with the Agency was terminated
and that there was no prospect of any financial assistence in
the foreseeable future,

DISPATCH

3.. HARSHALL said he knew AMSIDDY-1 had some weapons. |
AMBIDDY-1 replied that tne weapons in ‘iicaranua had been
given tc. the ‘icaraguan Governzent, dut MARSHALL continued
to press the point, saying he knew there were otnerse
AMBIDDY-1 at last reluctantly aduitted that he did have
few more scattered around under tight security (ne says this
is not true, in fact), but indicated thst he had other plans
for their use. MAXSHAL! sais he did not care where they
were or what they cost, he would buy them. AMBIDDY~1 asked
“him why he wantad weapons so badly, and! MARSHALL replied that
he was always in the market for weapons. AMBIDDY-1 said he
was aware of that fact, but this did not sound like just | i

another routine business deal. He went on to say that he
would not even consider releasing any of his arns without
knowing where they were going and for what use, and that he
had heard that MARSHALL had sold weapons previously to the
Communists. He would ha’ nothing to do with suh an opera=-
tion, regardless of any possible profit in it. He tried to
elicit as much information as possible, but got very little.
MARSHALL said they had a common friend in General SOMOZA, to |

which AMBLIDDY-1 replied that this was fairly recent as SONOZA
and MARSHALL had been bitter enemies up until about the last
three years. AMBIDDY-1 said he had to know how scny arms

were wanted, when, where, and for what purpose. MARSHALL said
he wanted all he could get, as soon as possible, in Costa Rica,
and the reason was that he knew a coup was being prepared and
he wanted to get his own people ready in time. AMBIDDY-1 said :
he would have to think about the proposition and would give :
him an answer in about three weeks. (He intends to stall and

make no commitmen hoping to draw out more information. He s 5
will not agree to sell any arms.)

&. On 7 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked with Daniel E
ODUBER at the latter's office. ODUBER said he was worried z

about all the talk of coup plotting, weapons and other indica- i
a tors of posaible violence. ODUBER ‘again mentioned to AMBIDDY=-1
that he had a finca on the Pacific Coast near the Nicaraguan rl

porder which has an airstrip adequate for 4 C46 or Cob7
type aircraft, and made an effort to feel out AMBIDDY-1 about

the possibility of landing arms on that airstrip. AMBIDDY-1
was noncommital and ODUBER did not press the point.

&. AMBIDDY-1 said (as his opinion) that he had gotten
the impression from talking with MARSHALL and ODUBER that.
ODUBER is pushing MARSHALL to stage @ coup attempt: in the hope

| that he, ODUBER, can ctep in at the right tine and clgin. thé:

SUBJECT : Subversive and Political Activities in
Central America

Source of the following information is a promiacnt
Cuban exile who is a fairly reliable reporter. He has a
large number of direct and indirect contacts with
Anfluontial Latin Averican nationals. Source acquired the
information from discussions held with the individuals
mentioned, during the month of December 1966.

During a conversation with Frack Marshall in early
Decenber 1966, source learned that Marshall wanted to buy
rms and asked source to supply them. Marshall said that
he needed them for what he called "an expected revolutionary
eutburat from one moment to the next in Costa Rica", aad be
id not want his “private arsenal" to be sualler than the
arsenals of the Calderon Guardia group, Pepe Figueres'
group, Oduber's group and the Communist group.

_ @sked Marshall when he needed the arms and Marshall
gusvered NOW. Source replied that he would need at least
three weeks to think about Marshall's request and then be
would give Marshall an answer. After consideriag what
. pource had said, Marshall replied, “okay, I can give you
ene month to give me an answer but no more." Source
believes Marshall ie in a plot to cverthrow the Costa
Rican Government. In source’s opinion "the situation in
Coste Rica is very bad because the president doses not lave
@ definite political group to sunvert hin and theregore is
fia the hands of diverse groups; Calderon Guardia, Ulate.
Zohandi, Frank Marshall etc., who respond to their ovn
fecterian interests and not to Costa Rica, and who respond
wach lees to President Trejos. <no Partido Liberecion —~
Magionsi, (PLM) is expecting a coup d’otat and plen to |
Counteroattack and stay in power."

Ya a conversation with Daniel Oduber in early
- Deoenber 1966, source states that Oduber “spoke badhy »oovt
* Dom Pepe Figueres and "Chico Orlich".  Oduber said tozt
"they wanted to eliminate his presidential aspiratious zor
> the coming campaign and postulate Don Fepe agaio.”
Oduber said that "they (Don Pepe and Orlich) ware the
