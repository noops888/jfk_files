Investigating Firms),‘' which was prepared in response to the
Director's testinony before the Senate Select Committee on”
23 May 1975 concerning specific instances where the Agency
Led ieee private investigative firms, attached hereto 35

2. In conducting the original research into those
instances where private investigative firms have been utilized
by the Agency, specific attention was directed at the use of
private investigative “€irms" and did not include the Agency's
use of individual private investigators. In view of the above
additional research has now been conducted, It would be
appreciated 4£ the following information could be considered
as an addendum to referenced nenorandun:

a. Since 1956 the Office of Security has
engaged in a program whereby 8 number of qualified
individuals throughout the United States have been
employed as independent contractors to conduct
background investigations on pehalf of the Ageacy.
This program, known within the Office of Security
as the Confidential Correspondent Program, is
almost totally couprised of retired U.S. Govern-
ment investigators. The majority of these indi-
viduals have entered secondary professions following
their retirement covering a broad spectrum to

include lav. real estate, construction, and
private investigations. By virtue of their
former federal investigative peckgrounds, these
fndividuals are able to conduct anvestigations
on behalf of the Agency in aoe

which are remote from exist

field offices and also provide the Office of
Security with the ability to expand oF contract
its investigative capability 35 requirements
dictate. Each Confidential correspondent is
carefully selected and security approved pefore
any investigative tasks are assigned.

primarily the use of Confidential
Correspondents has been limited to their con-
ducting background jnvestigations with an Agency~
issued U.S. Government credential, aithough in
some es correspondents have been provide
with (the same commerciel cover credentials used 08

independently as private investigators have been

of their private investigative positions, they
have been allowed to use their own “natural cover"

In all such cases Headquarters approval was
required pefore permitting the individual to Use
his own cover. Furthers this type of Confidential

possibility that @ Confidential Correspondent
might misuse such & credential 4n the conduct

b. It should also be noted that Robert A.
Maheu, who has already been the subject of
extensive reporting to the Senate Select Con-
mittee, was in 1954 operating his own private
investigative company known as Robert A. Maheu
Associates. As has been reported, Mr. Naheu
had been utilized by the Office of Security in
connection with several sensitive assignments
during the period 1954 through 1962.

While the review of Mr. Maheu's Office
of Security file does not disclose specific data
regarding any background investigative activities
which he may have conducted on behalf of the
Agency, it would appear probable froa available
information that Mr. Maheu hed on occasion con-
ducted such investigations. Mr. Maheu’s file
does reflect that from approximately February
through July 1954, the Office of Security paid a
monthly retainer of $500.09 per month to Robert A.
Maheu and that following July 1954 he was to be
reinbursed on a "case-by-case" basis.

3. As evidenced herein and in the referenced memorandum,
instances where the Office of Security has contracted with
private investigative firms and/or private investigators to
conduct investigations on our behalf has been quite limited.
Primarily ,[¢overt investigations by the Office of Security 4
have been conducted through the use of a private investigative
cover mechanism for our own employees or through the use of a
proprietary investigative Firs, |] Further, your attention is
invited to a memorandum for thé Director dated 4 June 1975
(attached hereto as Tab B) which advises that the Office of
Security has researched the future need for the Agency to
retain the lepal authority to hire private investigators and/
or firms to conduct investigations on our behalf. As indi-
cated in Tab B, the Office of Security interposes no objections
should the Director decide that in the future the use of private of
investigators will be restricted tof[proprietaryjfires and/or the
use ef private investigative firns cover for our own exployees. |!
