HEMORANDUM FOR: Inspoctor General

VIA

SUBJECT

: Deputy Director for Administration

: Senate Select Comittee on Intelligence

Operations

(Anti-Pinkerton Act)

1.

Reference is made to a memorandum dated 28 May 1975

captioned "Allegod Illegal Domestic Activities (Private

Investigating Firns),"

which was prepared in response to the

Director's testinony before the Senate Select Committee on

2a way 1975 concerning specific instances where the Agency

nas utilizod private investigative firms, attached hereto as

Tab

2.

In conducting the original research into those

Instances where private invostigative firus have been utilized

specific attention was directed at the use of

private investigative "firms" and did not include the Agency's

use of individual private investigators.

In view of the above

additional research has now been conducted. It would be

appreciated if the following infornation could be considered

as an addendun to referenced memorandus:

Since 1950 the Office of Security has

engaged in a progran whereby a number of qualified

individuals throughout the United States have been

onployed as indopendent contractors to conduct

background investigations on behalf of the Agency.

This progias, know within the office of security

as the Confidential Correspondent Program, 15

almost totally comprisod of retired U.S. Govern-

ment investigators.

The majority of these indi

viduals have entered secondary professions following

private Investigations.

By virtue of theis

former federal investigative backgrounds, these

individuals are able to conduct investigations

on behalf of the Agency in geographical aroas

which are remote fron existing Office of Security

field offices and also provido the Office of

Socurity with the ability to expand or contract

its Investigative capability as requirements

dictate.

Each Confidentlal Correspondent 1s

carefully selected and security approved before

any investigative tasks are assigned.

Primarily the use of Confidential

Correspondents has been linited to their con-

ducting background investigations with an Agency-

Issued U.S. Covernment credential, although in

SOmE CASES corTespondents have been provided

with the sane commercial cover credentials used 08

by staff investigators of the Office of Security

to conduct covert investigations, However, in

* Linited number of instances, Individuals vorking

Independently as private investigators have been

employed as Confidential Correspondents.

In view

of tholt private investigative positions, they

have been allowed to use their own "natural cover".

to conduct covert investigations on behalf of the

Agoncy.

This latter type of situation has been

extremely linited during the twenty-five year

history of the Confidential Correspondont Program.

In all such cases Headquarters approval was

required before peraitting the individual to use

his own cover. Further,

this type of Confidential

correspondent was generally not issued any U.S.

Governnent credential, in order to prevent the

possibility that e Confidential Correspondent

might misuse such a credential in the conduct

of his own business activities. Our research

Indicates that the last instance where a private

investigator was a Confidontial Correspondent

and utilized his own "natural cover" to conduct

Agency investigations occurred circa 1969.

b. It should also be noted that Robert A.

Maheu, who has already been the subject of

extensive reporting to the Senate Select Con-

mittee, was in 1954 operating his own private

investigative company known as Robert A. Maheu

Associates.

lad been utilized by the office of Security is

is has been reported

connection with several sensitive assignments

during the period 1954 through 1962.

While the revier of Nr. Maheu's Office

of Security file doos not disclose specific data

regarding any background investigative activities

which he may have conducted on behalf of the

Agency, it would appear probable froa available

Inforation that MI. Mahou had on occasion con-

ducted such investigations.

Mr. Maneu's file

does reflect that from approximately February

through July 1954, the Office of Security paid &

monthly retainer of $500.00 per month to Robert A.

mahou and that following July 1954 he was to be

reimbursed

on a "case-by-case" basis.

As evidenced herein and in the referenced menorandun,

instancos where the Office of Security has contracted with

private investigative firus and/or private investigators to

conduct investigations on our behalf has beer quite lisites 08

Prinarily, covert investigations by the Office of Security

have beer conducted through the use of a private investigative

cover mechanism for our own employees of through the use of a

propriotary investigative firt. | Further, your attention 1s

invited to a memorandum for the Director

dated 4 June 1975

(attached hereto as Tab B) which advises that the Office of

security has researched the future need for the Agency to

rotels the legal authority to hire private investigators and/

or firas to conduct investigations on our bohalf.

As indi-

cated in Tab B, the Office of Security Interposes no objections

should the Director decide that in the future the use of private

08

Investigators will be rostricted to proprietaryifiras and/or the

use ef private investigative firasles cover for our own employees. Ja
