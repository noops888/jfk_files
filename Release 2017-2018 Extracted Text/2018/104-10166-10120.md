MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/COG

SUBJECT: James C, Wray,

1, Lealled Mr. James C. Wray today to determine his reason
for having called the Agency on 27 February regarding Antonio CUESTA
Del Valle's patent application, At that time Wray had stated that as a

patent attorney he was representing CUESTA who had an application

pending on which some $140 in fees was due.

| pmaecmnnnt enema et

2. Wray advised that he had been retained by CUESTA several
years ago to file an application ecncerned with a high speed boat on

which a patent was ready to issue upon payment af $140 in filing fees.

He atated farther that as a consequence of CUESTA's subsequent capture
te had been unable to communicate with him. and that he had failed in his

efforts to interest CUESTA's friends in assuming responsibility for the

fees, Wray readily accepted my representations that the Agency had no
- responsibility in the matter. According to him, he had called us inerely
a matter of last resort. : : :

“ts “9, found Wray's description of the boat's configuration and
Pattributes to be interesting. While emphasizing that we had no ree
sponsibility for his clignt's present situation or for his fees, I suggested

that he might want to provide me with the boat's specifications, Wray
- accepted this-sugguetion. My thought here was that an item of this nature

~ might be of interest to SOD/Maritime Branch.
