MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/COG

SUBJECT:

James C. Wray

1. I called Mr. James C. Wray today to determine his reason

for having called the Agency on 27 February regarding Antonio CUESTA

Del Valle'a patent application. At that time Wray had stated that as &

patent attorney he was representing CUESTA who had an application

pending on which some $140 in fees was due.

& Wray advised that he had been retained by CUESTA several

years ago to file an application cracerned with a high speed boat on

which a patent was ready to issue upon payment of $140 in filing fees.

He tated further that as a consequence of CUESTA's subseguent capture

he had been unable to communicate with him and that he had failed in his

efforto to interest CUESTA's friends in assuming responsibility fos the

fees. Wray readily accepted my representations that the Agency had aọ

responsibility in the matter. According to him, he had called un merely

i as & matter of last resort.

9. I found Wray's description of the boat"s configuration and

attributon to be interesting.

While emphasizing that we had no re-

sponsibility for his cliund's present situation or for his fees, I suggested

that he might want to provide me with the boat's specifications. Wray

nocepted thin sugrustion. My thought here was that an item of this nature

might be of interest to SOD/Maritire Branch..
