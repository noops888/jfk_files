1.

Wiis relerance to a telopbonic conversation on 28 July 1965

between Mi.

and Mi. DEMPSEY regarding a piece of correspond.

ence addrassed initially to Life magazine and therealter to the Depusy

Direcios, Central Intelligence, Mi. HELMS, the auchor(a) therein signed

Â¿bemselves as "Agant 701" and "Spy out in the cold".

%. As was indicated to you, li would be appreciaied il efforts

could do made to identity the responaible party or parties by reviewing

chosa "Surplus Employees" records who may have applied fo: Peaco

Corps employment. This faci which conceivably could be a lay to idea

Lilying the suchos may hava been broughi to your accention in which case

is would be appreciated li you would noly Mi. J. R. MURPHY 03 Mr.

DEMPSEY on 16560.

3. For your intormation and razontion there is atached nere-

with a copy of the queationad correspondence receivad by MI. HaLs.

Eiforts were made to desermine the manner in which said attachment

was received bu: unfortunately the envelope, which presumably the note

was dalivered is, was destroyed or losi. Mr. HELMS' secretary, who

has had occasion lo caserve other such questionable correspondence,

direcied to MI. MELVS in the pass, quite correctly thought it a maiter

the haadwricing. This suggestion will of course be considered, but it

would greaily facilitate such an effori it by chance through your screen-

ing the aumber of suspecis could bopelally be roduced.

4. Your cooperadioa or opinione in this matter will de appro-

cisted. and welcomed.
