MEMORANDUM NO, 3

SUBJECT : GARRISON and the Kennedy
Assassination ~

REFERENCE : CI/R&A Memorandum of 8 May 1967,
Subject as Above

1," Recently District Attorney James C, GARRISON has made
a nuniber of spectacular charges against CIA, These charges became
more vehement after newspaper and magazine articles attacking the
GARRISON probe had been printed by The Saturday Evening Post,
Newsweek and (on 21 May 1967) the New York Times,

2. The following are the major accusations made by GARRISON
since 8 May 1967, the date of reference:

a... ‘CIA and the FBI "cooperated in concealing facts
behind the assassination of President John F, Kennedy from both
the.Warren Commission and the American public," CIA "knew
all along that the Warren Commission's report-was completely
untrue in-its conclusion that Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey
Oswald acting alone."" Thé GARRISON investigation "has turned
up mounting evidence of CIA involvement in Kennedy's death."
GARRISON asserted that CIA "duped the Commission by flooding
its members with a gush of irrelevant information to obscure the

“truth,” (The Washington Star, 8 May 1967.)

b. GARRISON intended to-ask "the U.S, Senate to investi-
gate" the "alleged Central Intelligence Agency 'coverup!."
GARRISON is a personal friend of Senator Russell Long of Louisiana
(Washington Post and Times Herald, 9 May 1967.)

c. GARRISON has told the New Orleans States-Item
that "Oswald was probably a CIA agent who worked undercover
with anti-Castro Cubans while publicly demonstrating for Castro,
The... CIA and the FBI were aware of Oswald's connections



secy ns

wetiaid oe
with anti-Castro organizations but withheld the information from
the Warren Commission, The CIA and the FBI presented the
Commission a fake picture of Oswald and withheld information

about Oswald because he and/or a Cuban companion were CIA
agetts,"" (UPI of 9 May 1967.)

a, . The New Orleans Grand Jury issued a subpoena calling
on GIA to produce its photograph of Oswald and a Cuban companion
in Mexico City, (UPI, 10 May 1967.) :

-e. On 10 May Mark LANE, author of Rush to- Judgment,
testified before the New Orleans Grand Jury. Upon emerging
from the jury room he identified CIA as the "powerful domestic
force'' which", . . participated in the original plan which, in
fact, culminated in the death" of the President. (The New Orleans

Time-Picayune, 11 May 1967.)

f, | GARRISON charged on ll May 1967 that CIA was
paying the lawyers of some persons involved in his investigation.
He named Burton KLEIN (attorney for Alvin BEAUBOEUF) and
Steven PLOTKIN (an attorney for Gordon NOVEL) as having 9
received CIA money. Both denied the charge. (AP, 1 May 1967.)
(Comment: No CIA record of KLEIN or PLOTKIN. )

g. GARRISON claimed on 12 May 1967 that Oswald's
notebook contained an entry, PO 19106, which was an ericoded
version of Jack Ruby's unlisted Dallas telephone number, WH 1-5601,

h, On 8 May 1967 GARRISON "said that he had begun an
investigation of the activities of the CIA and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation." (The New York Times, 1 May 1967.)

i, On 12 May GARRISON claimed that Ruby's unlisted
number also appeared in an address book belonging to Clay L.
SHAW, (AP, 12 May 1967.)

js On 15 May 1967 an attorney for Clay L, SHAW said
that the figure PO 19106 in Oswald's address book was a telephone
numbex in Russia, (The New Orleans Time-Picayune of 16 May
1967,) (Comment; The statement is almost certainly correct,
as has been previously reported, The prefix is believed to be in
Cyrillic, .a double D, not PO, The entry is placed among others

written in Russian by Oswald in Moscow or Minsk, very

probably the former, On 23 May 1967 the FBI confirmed to
C/CI/R&A that the page had been shown to Marina Oswald, -who
could throw no new light on it, An FBI expert had made a

visual re-exarnination of the original, On this basis he could give
only an unofficial opinion, but it was his view that all entries

on the page had been written in the same ink and at the same time,
The FBI has not given us a-written report on this subject. )

“k. On 17 May 1967 GARRISON said, "We are particularly
interested in clarifying now why there is also coded in Lee
Oswald's address book the local phone number of the Central
Intelligence Agency. We have had evidence for some time that
in Dallas, Texas, Jack Ruby was working for the CIA at the same
time Lee Oswald was working for the CIA here, This means that
the CIA well knew that these two men knew each other. We also
have evidence that Lee Oswald was not the only man in Dealy
Plaza who was an employee. of the CIA and now we have found the
phone number of the CIA in the front of Lee Oswald's address
book. Since it is obvious that it is no longer possible to get truth
in any form from officials of the CIA agency (sic) in Washington,
no matter. how highly placed, we are looking forward to talking to
this businessman from Irving, Texas, about some of these
coincidences." (The New Orleans States-Item of 17 May 1963.)

1, - On 22 May 1967 the Moscow Domestic Service and
TASS gave publicity to GARRISON's charges against CIA, The
Havana Domestic Service published onthe same day a longer (two
page) account which included the following: "Five Cuban counter~
revolutionaries, acting on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency,
assassinated President John F, Kennedy on 23 November 1963,

New Orleans District Attorney James Garrison said last night."

m, The above item is based upon a TV appearance on

21 May 1967 by GARRISON, who told the WWL-TV audience that
Oswald did not even touch a gun on the day of the assassination, *
that the five Cuban assassins were angered by President Kennedy's
handling of the Bay of Pigs, and that CIA, which he labeled as
more powerful than the Gestapo in Nazi Germany, was withholding
its information from his office, (The Washington Post, 22 May
1967.)



i .
( SECRET —

n,.__ In the same TV speech GARRISON claimed that
CIA knew the names of the Cubans involved and that CIA had
said of Oswald, ''As for the kid, well, that's just one of those
things." (Washington Daily News, 22 May 1967.)

0. A TASS item, in English, 29 May 1967, ran as follows:
",.. ; GARRISON said today‘over ABC that President Kennedy
was killed not by Oswald but by a group of conspirators made up,
in particular, of former employees of the U.S, Central Intelligence
Agency. ‘Oswald himself was not a CIA agent, but was obviously
an intelligence employee of the U.S, Government." "The CIA
concealed from the Warren Commission, ‘from the American
people, and from the world the fact that its former employees. were
involved in the assassination. . ., Garrison said, The attorney
repeated his call for a congressional investigation of the CIA,"

3, ‘The AC/WH/COG has replied to the CI/R&A memorandum of
26 April 1967 by providing information about a number of Cuban individuals
and groups. (The WH/COG memorandum and its attachments are included
herewith as Enclosure #1 and copies to the ADDP, the Office of the

f. Gordon Duane NOVEL, (20) A separate memorandum
on NOVEL has been prepared and forwarded to recipients of this
report. Despite his claims and those of one of his lawyers, there
is no record to substantiate any direct association with CIA, His

ties to Walter SHERIDAN suggest a possibility that NBC is coaching

NOVEL to get maximum publicity before picturing him on a TV
program intended to destroy GARRISON's act.

He was employed by CIA from December 1960 to 15 October 1963,

6. The recent developments concerning Alvin BEAUBOUEF merit

summiarizing. ‘Burton KLEIN, BEAUBOUEF's attorney, said on iv
May 1967 that he had turned over to authorities in Jefferson Parish a
tape recording of an attempt by investigators working for GARRISON

to bribe BEAUBOUEF to give false testimony. BEAUBOUEF, a 21-year

old and unemployed, was. allegedly offered a job with an airline if he
would cooperate, The offer was reportedly made by two policemen
representing GARRISON, One of them, Lynn LOISEL, repeated and
elaborated the offer of a bribe in the presence of KLEIN, who tape
recorded the discussion without LOISEL's knowledge. LOISEL offered
$3,000 and an airline job, KLEIN, who no longer represents BEAU-

BOUEF, took the tape to Washington and tried to sell it to Walter SHERIDAN,

the NBC news reporter, for $5,000, He rejected an offer of $500, Learn-
ing of the tape, GARRISON's men called again on BEAUBOUEF, threatened
that he would be shot if he got in the way. (They had previously threatened
to make public some photographs linking BEAUBOUEF to the homosexual

David FERRIE,) They took him to the court house and frightened him
into signing a statement that he had not considered the offer of a bribe.

Emilio SANTANA (paragraph 7 C of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 7 Sept 1935, Cardenas, Matanzas, Cuba
(also reported 7 Sept’1936 and’? Sept 1937

1. Subject is probably identifiable With.Emilio SANTANA
Galindo, who Was recruited by JMWAVE in December 1960 as a
guide for an infiltration team, SANTANA was paid a monthly
salavy under provisions of his MOC until he was terminated
on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team
becanie inoperable due to occupation of the target area by
Soviet technicians. Another compelling reason for SANTANA's
termination stemmed from his untruthful reporting concerning
certain aspects of the team operations, ,

2, In an attempt to establish positive identification,
INWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miami)
Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no matronymic)
born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive fyom 5
Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet
132287F, based on two counts of. burglery in Louisiana,

He was arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's
office on 2 February 1966 and was presumably sent back to
Louisiana. At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his
address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same
address shown on an old immigration im when he was

living in Miami, Headquarters files indicate SANTANA is
separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami-address.. Since SANTANA’s date of birth varies
on various documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth
date on hig arrest sheet is not conclusive. The fact he
did give his former address to the arresting officers
indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo. A 1962 inmigration
form includes a photograph which could be obtained ‘from
SMWAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

3. Although JMWAVE has had.no contact with SANTANA
since his termination, there is a note in Station files
dated 23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his
employer on an augo credit application.

Sergio Vicente ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

SEE “Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date he first

arrived in the U.S.. However, he became the FRENTE REVOLU-
CiONARIO DEMOCRATICO. (FRD) delegate in New Orleans prior

to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position
until the FRD ceased to function, The FRD was the predecessor
of the. CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and
supported by the Agency. The organization was used as a 7
front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion.

During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters

in Miami through a-post office box in Coral Gables, and

. reportedly maintained extensive relations with the New

Orleans FBI-and Immigration offices, Two of his regular _
FBI contacts: were a Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy
Banister.

2. ARCACHA was also one of the promoters of the
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was incorporated
in New Orleans on 6 January 1961. This organization was
ostensibly. created by several New Orleans business and .
political figures, including the deceased former ¥BI agent,
Guy Banister, to collect money to aid Cubans in their
fight against Communism, According to the articles of
incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the funds were to bé channeled through ARCACHA,
less a percentage to be retained by the FDC. An investi-
gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded
that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal gain
of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA, The investigation produced no evidence that any
individual donations were ever solicited or received and
recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the
books of the New,Srleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of
federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F, Tufague, and the Chief
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC. Approximately one month after the
FDC was created, strong criticism from some prominent Cubans
put the organization out of business.

3. Information in an immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezuela at an unspecified
date, Wis address in Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA, Caracas,
and his US address was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Lawrence J, LABORDE, 201-294688

1, On ll May 1967 the headquarters office of the Domestic
Contacts Service telephoned the C/CI/R&A and said that Subject had
telephoned the New Orleans office of the DCS that day. Subject said that
he was an ex-CIA employee, that he feared that D.A. Jim GARRISON
would subpoena him, that he was willing to leave the U.S, to avoid a

subpoena,.and that he wanted the office to tell him what to do.

2. » A réview of Subject's file has led to the hypothesis that this
visit may have been a provocation, probably engineered by GARRISON
in an attempt to trap CIA into advising Subject to leave Louisiana.-

Had such advice been given, GARRISON would have been able to buttress
his charge that CIA is attempting to obstruct the course of justice in
New Orleans.

3, The Miami Station requested a provisional covert security
approval for Subject.on 14 March 1961, The request was granted on
24 March 1961, (A PCSA approves contact for spotting and assessing
only.) However, a 31 March 1961 cable from Miami requested per~
mission to increase Subject's salary to $700 a month and to pay him
bonuses, 7

4," A Headquarters dispatch of 23 March 1962 warned Miami
that Subject was indiscreet, drank too much, and had an unsavoury
reputation, On 20 April 1962 Miami cancelled the request for an
approval, on the grounds that Subject was a poor security risk.
Subject had no later relationship with the Agency.’ Subject was bitter
about his CIA contacts when terminated and made reckless threats,

5, An FBI report of 23 May 1962 said Subject had contacted
representatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC, Agency-created.
and supported) in New Orleans, his home town; had offered his services;
and had said he was running a boat out of Key West, smuggling Cubans
and guns with the knowledge of CIA.

Coo, SECRET  ¢

6, . A Miami report of June 1962 said that Subject was employed
1947-1949.in Mexico by the U.S, Department of Agriculture but was
fixed for excessive drinking, discharging unauthorized firearms, and
non-support of.dependent children,

7... The New Orleans States~Item of 28 July 1962 named Subject
as the-source of bitterly anti-CIA remarks in a story which praises
LABORDE as'a "good family man, completely reliable'', ‘and quotes a
Cuban refugee leader as saying that CIA and FBI agents termed Subject
aman.of integrity, An anti-CIA article in the Denver Post of 3 June 1962
also appears to be based on statements from LABORD:

8. FBI reporting of August 1962 stated that LABORDE had duped
certain persons into buying a schooner, the Elsie Reichart, by saying
that he. and a.crew.would operate it for Cuban operations which the
U.S, Government could not openly acknowledge but for which it would

pay handsomely.

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIANTIL (DRE)
(SYUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1. ‘the DRE was conceived, created and funded by the
Agency in September 1960 and terminated in December 1966.
It was an outgrowth of the activist student group in Cuba
which fought against BATISTA and later against CASTRO,
Many of the leaders came into exile around September 1960
and were subsequently trained and infiltrated into Cuba
by the Agency ‘in late 1960 where they operated by obtain-
ing intelligence setting up action teams, etc., up through
the Bay of Pigs invasion. While the DRE was initially set
up as a psych warfare outfit, the organization was given a
large amount of paramilitary aid in:funds and material, ’
After the Bay of Pigs, the DRE engaged in independent
military actions, which declined at Agency direction and
because of a reduction in funds from late 1962 until ter-
nination of the group. Members were used through 1966 as
political action agents, for publishing propaganda which .
was sent throughout the Hemisphere, attending in national
student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio
programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2. After the cutback in military operations, many

of the best DRE members relocated in other areas, At
present there are delegations in most Latin American coun-
tries which have maintained some contact with various
Agency stations over the years. although the DRE is no
longer very active.’ During the organization's 6 year
period of active existence DRE personnel were in contact
with several JMWAVE staffers and outside contract agents.
However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact
with DRE personnel was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel

-SALVAT, the. current DRE: Secretary General who is now

operating a bookstore in Miami, Florida, and Fernando
GARCIA Chacon who was relocated in El Salvador.

TNE INFORMATYON COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAS, INC, (INCA)

,

1. INCA is-an anti-Communist. propaganda organization
with headquarters in New Orleans, that disseminates English
and foreign. language propaganda tapes and ‘films on a world
wide basis, conducts public forums of an extremist
political nature, etc. The organizational. impetus and funds
apparently come. from wealthy New Orleans figures including
Dr. Aiton OCHSNER, .of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard E.
ROBERTSON. In. recent years funds have been supplied by the
SCHICK ‘SAVETY, RAZOR COMPANY. An INCA letterhead listing all
the officers ‘and officials has been requested from JMWAVE,
which has. had some casual correspondence with the organiza-.
tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO,

2. There is no indication of any Agency relationship
with INCA prior to.January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss

“ CASTRO's appearance in New Orleans. At that time an Agency”

asset who functioned as Miss CASTRO's business manager was
involved with INCA officials in planning the New Orleans
visit where Miss CASTRO was given an award at a dinner
sponsored by INCA. ‘The dinner, which was attended by civic
leaders and representatives of all news media, took place
shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was
considerable interest in her appearance. INCA was particularly
interested since it had distributed hundreds of Unglish

and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when
she was surfaced in Mexico. In October 1966 INCA again
vequested that Miss CASTRO appear as a guest speaker in
mujor American cities in connection with the release of

the INCA motion picture production "HITLER IN HAVANA",
Following various reviews of the film, JMWAVE decided the
film would probably become controversial and it would be
inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.
Because of INCA's extremist political orientation, JMWAVE
has wanted to avoid any more involvement between Miss CASTRO
and INCA’and the Station asset, in his capacity as business
manager, has managed to prevent this. There has been only
one casual contac? between our asset and Edward BUTLER,
