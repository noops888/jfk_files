surete nationate (833, ud 125-66 mapal police),

has been employed as the Miami representative of the

Interchange Bank of Chiasso, Switzerland, over a long

period of time.

It was ascertained during contact with

him following his arrest in Paris, that he solicits

accounts of individuals in and around Miami for the

Interchange Bank (U)

•Since we were of some assistance to SANTIAGO

in connection with the investigation of the allegations

against bim in Paris and in view of the Bureau's con-

siderable interest in Swiss banking operations, the Bureau

may wish' to consider having Miami attempt to develop

SANTIAGO: as an informant.

It is believed that SANTIAGO

has beefcused by the Miami Office in the past, and he may

be susceptible to development in this regard.

SANTIAGO, who was en route from Milan to Paris by air, was

suspected of having been involved in a holdup in New York

City, New York.

He was reported by the Milan Police to be

going to Paris to meet another American, whose identity was

unknown, at the George V Hotel and that

the second American

may be in possession of a large number of stolen stock

certificates recently stolen in a New York holdup.

The French Police intercepted SANTIAGO at the time

of his arrival at Orly Airport, Paris, on the evening of

September 16, 1966.

His baggage, brief case and clothing

were thoroughly searched by the French Police and nothing

unusual

was noted other than a rubber stamp which reads as

follows: "Signatures Guaranteed, Franklin National Bank,

Madison Ave:, New York City, N. Y."

SANTIAGO admitted that this is the type of rubber

stamp used in the transfer of stock certificates but denied

that he had anything to do with such activities. He advised

the police that he had found this rubber stamp at Kennedy

International Airport, New York City, when he was boarding

the plane for Italy and that he had intended to return it by

mail to the Franklin National Bank but had neglected to do

In spite of questigning by the French Police, SANTIAGO

SANTIAGO claims to be employed as the Miami Representa-

tive of the Inter Change Bank at Chiasso, Switzerland. He had

in his possession two checkbooks from this bank and states

that he is in a position to accept signature cards from

prospective clients and immediately turn over checkbooks

when deposits are made.

SANTIAGO was held by the French Police during the

night of September 16, 1966; was released at approximately

noon on September 17, 1966, and was summoned to reappear at

9:00 AM on September

19, 1966. His passport was held by

the French Police as assurance of his return.

The. rubber

stamp from the Franklin National Bank was seized by the French

Police and will be turned over to the Public Prosecutor of

Paris for disposition.

At the time SANTIAGO returned to the French Police

neadquarters at 9:00 AM, September 19, 1966, and since it

lad been determined that he was not wanted for arrest in the

United States, his passport was returned to him by the French

Police

and he

was discharged from further appearance.

Investigation by the PJSN determined that on the

afternoon of September 17, 1966, one SAMUEL F• BENTON

attempted to contact SANTIAGO at the George V Hotel, Paris.

It was determined by the French Police that BENTON

residing at the Paris Hilton Hótel.

He was contacted there

and was brought to French Police headquarters for questioning.

BENTON identified himself as a private detective

in Miami, Florida, and had as proof of this a private detective's

license and badge.

He stated that he has no criminal record

and is well known to the Miami Police because of his occupation.

A thorough search of

his

baggage, brief case and clothing by

the French Police failed to disclose any evidence that BENTON

was involved at this time in the negotiation of stolen or

false securities.

BENTON stated that he knows SANTIAGO as an

acquaintance in Miami and that they had agreed to meet in

Paris, but stated that there was no significance to their

meeting.

He stated that they had merely decided to see Paris

together.
