period of time. It was ascertained during contact with

im, cdfinec fiGu-wi th the investigation of the allegations

his association with MARCOS PEREZ JIMENEZ.

None of the Special Agents in the Miami Office
currently handling ITSP matters have any information concerning
the activities of SAMUEL FINK BENTON which would relate in
any way to the information in the Letterhead Memorandum
prepared by the Legat in Paris.

There is no information in the possession of the
Special Agents of the Miami Office that EXPEDITO FELIX ROBERT
SANTIAGO has been involved in the illegal transfer and
sale of securities.

dated September 17, 1966, no warrants are known to be currently

It is not desired that SAMUEL FINK BENTON be
included in the general appearance file of the Bureau at

Detective EDOUARD STEINER of the Police Judiciaire

September 17, 1966, that the French Police had been alerted
by the police of Milan, Italy, that EXPEDITO FELIX ROBERT
SANTIAGO, who was en route from Milan to Paris by air, was
| suspected of having been involved in a holdup in New York
q City, New York, He was reported by the Milan Police to be
going to Paris to meet another American, whose identity was
i unknown, at the George V Hotel and that the second American
may be in possession of a. large number of stolen stock
j certificates recently stolen in a New York en

The French Police intercepted SANTIAGO at the time i
of his arrival at Orly Airport, Paris, on the evening of 7 i
September 16, 1966, His baggage, brief case and clothing ;
were thoroughly searched by the French Police and nothing '
unusual was noted other than a rubber stamp which reads as
follows: "Signatures Guaranteed, Franklin National Bank,
Madison Ave., New York City, No. Yo" Z

SANTIAGO admitted that this is the type of rubber H
stamp used in the transfer of stock certificates but denied
| that he had anything to do with such activities. He advised

the police that he had found this rubber stamp at Kennedy H
' International Airport, New York City, when he was boarding 7
i the plane for Italy and that he had intended to return it by \
H mail to the Franklin National Bank but had neglected to do \

so. In spite of questigning by the French Police, SANTIAGO ~
stuck to this story. - :

H American at the George V Hotel in Paris. He stated that he
was visiting Paris ste). weekend en route from Milan, Italy,

SAMUEL _F, BENTON

SANTIAGO claims to be employed as the Miami Representa-
tive of the Inter Change Bank at Chiasso, Switzerland. He had
in his possession two checkbooks from this bank and states
that he is in a position to accept signature cards from
Prospective clients and immediately turn over checkbooks
when deposits are made.

SANTIAGO was held by the French Police during the
night of September 16, 1966; was released at approximately
noon on September 17, 1966, and was summoned to reappear at
9:00 AM on September 19, 1966, His passport was held by
the French Police as assurance of his return. The. rubber
Stamp from the Franklin National Bank was seized by the French
Police and will be turned over to the Public Prosecutor of
Paris for disposition. ce

At the time SANTIAGO returned to the French Police
headquarters at 9:00 AM, September 19, 1966, and since it
had been determined that he was not wanted for arrest in the
United States, his passport was returned to him by the French

J
/ Police and he was discharged from further appearance.

Investigation by the PJSN determined that on the

afternoon of September 17, 1966, one SAMUEL F, BENTON ©

attempted to contact SANTIAGO at the George V Hotel, Paris.

It was determined by the French Police that BENTON was —

residing at the Paris Hilton Hotel, He was contacted there

\

and was brought to French Police headquarters for questioning,

BENTON identified himself as a private detective
in Miami, Florida, and had as proof of this a private detective'’s
license and badge. He stated that he has no criminal record
and is well known to the Miami Police because of his occupation.
A thorough search of his baggage, brief case and clothing by
the French Police failed to disclose any evidence that BENTON
was involved at this time in the negotiation of stolen or
false securities.

BENTON stated that he knows SANTIAGO as an
acquaintance in Miami and that they had agreed to meet in
Paris, but stated that there was no significance to their
meeting. He stated that they had merely decided to see Paris
together,
