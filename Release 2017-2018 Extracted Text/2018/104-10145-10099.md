OLC 78-2060/3

9 June 1978

NOTE FOR: S. D. Breckinridge

FROM

: Rodger S. Gabrielson

SUBJECT : Conversation with Harold Leap, HSCA Staff

1. Hal stopped by our office to turn in his summary

file notes on the Japan connection. He indicated to me that he

has completed his interviews of all

people and

that he will conclude that there is no credible evidence

linking Oswald to a CIA operational connection in Japan.

2. Hal then talked about the trip to Mexico City.

He indicated that on Sunday they had travelled to the

residence of the former DCOS for an interview which was

arranged for the current cOS.

He said the team was very

disappointed in the DDCI's decision to deny direct access to

Durant, particularly since some of the individuals they had

interviewed indicated that the Station had passed to the

Mexican Liaison Service certain "take" from the surveillance

operations.

He did not specify whether this meant audio or

photo ops.. He left me with the impression that the Committee

would continue to press for access to Durant.
