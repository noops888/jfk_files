f+1, & confidential source abroad, has advised
that the publication "African Revolution" was. created by the
Algerian Front of National Liberation... Its English language
edition is published in Switzerland. There have been several
changes in the editorial composition aad policy of “African /
Revolution" recently, ‘according to T-1. Following a dis-
agreenent ‘with BEN BELLA, JACQUES CAMILLE VERGES, the’
editor of the “publication, was dismissed from his functions.
VERGES is an Algerian fational who was born March 5, 1925.
His place as editor was taken by MOHAMED HARBI,’ former oe
Secretary General of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign iS
Affairs. ‘Since HARBL became editor, the editorial: policy :
has changed and the: June, 1963, issue of “African Revolution"
andicated that the journal is now closely reflecting BEN
BELLA's policy and attempting to promote a more Algerian

image. ©° ey

Although VERGES is no longer connécted with the
Algerian venture, he continues ‘to publish the Boglish digest
of “African Revolution” from Lausanne, Switzerland, The
July, 1963, issue was retitled “Afvica, Latin America,, Asia
Revolution.” The phrase “the third world," which is now in.
vogue among VERGES's group to describe the underdeveloped

i nations of Africa, South America and Asia, indicates the

' scope ‘of the magazine in its new form. T-1 described this :
publication, with which VERGES is présentiy connected as pro- :

: tvd members of the Lausanne office of the “African
! Revolution” have remained. loyal to VERGES after he was

3 replaced by BARBI, They are FREDY GILBERT NILS ANDERSSON,

! a Swedish national who was born on February 14, 1933, in

: Lausanne, and RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON, a U: “oe citizen

who was born May: By 1931, in Los’ Angeles,

ANDERSSON apparently heads the office of the
Lausanne edition of “Africah Revolution” with offices at
10-11 Metropole, Lausanne. He 4s also editor-secretary of
“Societe Cooperative Clartee Editions.";

GIBSON has U. S$, Passport No. B-131994 which was
issued at Washington, D. C. on January 25, 1961. His wife
is JOY MARJORIE GIBSON, nee KAYE, who was bern July 12, 1926,
in London. She is a British subject, carries British pass-
port C156546, and ts also a journalist. She resides in
Lausanne at 17 Escaliers du Marche, where she arrived from
Algeria in late April 1963 (this also is presumably .the
residence of her husband, RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON) @ Bae

According to T=1, VERGES has been denied permission
te enter Switzerland. The case against ANDERSSON is still ~
pending (probably relating to whether or not he will be
allowed to remain in Switzerland), RICHARD THOMAS GIBSON

io has been refused a Swiss resident's permit and has been sr
ordered to depart from Switzerland before December 15, 1963 ©
