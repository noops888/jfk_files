that the publication

"African Revolution" wag created by the

Algerian Front of National Liberation. Its English language

edition is published in switzerland.

There have been several

changes in the editorial composition and policy of "African

Revolution" recently, according to I-l.

Following a dis-

agreement with BEN BELLA, JACQUES CAMILES VERGES, the

editor of the publication, was dismissed from his functions.

VIRGES is an Algerian national who was born Harch 6, 1925.

His place as editor was taken by MOHAMED HARBI,

former

Secretary General of the Algerian Ministry of Foreign

Affairs: Since MABBI became editor, the editorial policy

has changed and the June, 1963, issue of "African Revolution"

indicated that the Journal is

now closely reflecting BEN

BELLA'S policy

and attempting

i to promote a more Algerian

image.

Although VERGES is no longer connected with the

Algerian venture, he continues to publish the English digest

of Alrican Revolution" from Lausanne, Switzerland,

The

1963 g

issue was retitled "Africa, latin America, Asia

Revolution.

The phrase "the third world," which is now in

vogue among VERGES'S group to describe the underdeveloped

nations of Africa, South America and Asia, indicates the

scope of the magazine in its new form.
