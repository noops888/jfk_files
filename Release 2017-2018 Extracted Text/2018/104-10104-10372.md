James Garrison/George Brown--Possible Attempt
to Embarrass Agency

iy This confirms Haynes/Grant telecon of 27 December 1967.

2. Herbert Frensley, President of Brown and Root, Inc., xeported
to Haynes on 26 December that Mr. George Brown had received a disturbing
telephone call on Friday, 22 December 1967 from Hugh Aynesworth, Houston
Bureau reporter for Newsweek Magazine. Aynesworth told Brown that he had
received information from Bill Gervage (spelling?), former assistant to
New Orleans District Attorney James Garrison, that Garrison might try to
implicate Brown in the "Kennedy assassination plot".

3. The allegation is that in some unspecified manner, Brown was
involved with the CIA in its objective of "covering up" the "conspiracy"
for President Johnson. Aynesworth said Gervage has documents, including
at least one in Garrison's own handwriting, which presumably have been
extracted from Garrison's files. Aynesworth indicated that, if desired,
he could secure these documents from Gervage for review by Brown.
