MC• GOIDBERG had been placed in a compromising

by officials of this company and realized at that

time that he had been taken advantage of by MARGIOTTI and his

associates.

He also realized that these men were engaging in

questionable activities and felt that if he continued his

association with them it could jeopardize his standing as an

accountant.

In about 1950, he decided in discontinue his relationship

with MARGIOTTI and his associates.

He wrote registered letters

tO MARGIOTTI, GENOVESE, RIPEPI and others, advising them he

would no longer handle

their accounting.

At that time he would

have discontinued his association with LAROCCA.

except for the

tact that he was then doing accounting for LAROCCA in connection

wich

some litigation involving most of LARCCA's financial

interests.

LAROCOA asked him to continue doing his accounting

work at least until litigation was completed.

Actually,

this situation, has continued and LAROCCA has

become further

indebted to him, so that at present, LAROCCA owes him a

considerable amount of money for accounting fees.

In the past several years, LAROCCA has entertained Mr.

GOLDBERG at his residence for dinner and to meet his family.

Therefore, In the latter part of 1957, when visiting with

LAROCCA, Mr. GOLDBERG invited him to attend the wedding of

his son, which was to be held at Philadelphia.

In February,

1958, the wedding was held and LAFOCCA appeared accompanied

by ANTHONY RIPEPI. At this time, LAROCCA stated that his

wife was ill and could not accompany him. Mr. GOLDBERG at

that time did not know that LARCCA was wanted by the Govern-

ment or that there was any Federal Grand Jury Proceeding in

which LARCCA was involved.

He recalled that when he last visited with LARCCA prior

to the wedding, LAROCCA was having some trouble with his

throat, but at the wedding he did not notice

any trouble in

this regard.
