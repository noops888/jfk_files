Dear Joseph,

Please accept my appreciation for an assignment
well done as a member of the FY 1978 GS-07 Secretarial/
Clerical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April

I well’ recognize th

through 19 May 1978,

complexities involved in the
comparative’ evaluation o clerical carcerists --
a task further ccmplicat y this being only the second
year it has ‘been undertaken, Your deliberations were
vital to the Dircctorate‘s determination to bring to this
group of valuable employees the advantages of the merit
systen.

Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards
represents a major contribution to the Directorate's
program of personnel assessment and management. Not
only were your promotion recommendations valued, but
recommendations for career development and training
were also extremely helpful.

I believe that your service on the Board broadened
and sharpencd your own focus on personnel aspects of
Agency management. Too, I think that the time spent
in this endeavor could only have made you better aware
of our need for complete, carcful and candidly written

appraisals of our employees.
Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM FOR: giemasarteeeonesse
THRCUGH } Chief of Station, Meaico City
SUBJECT : Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization

Retirement and Disability System

REFERENCE : Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965

1, You have been found to be qualificd as a participant in the Organization Retirement
and Disability System and have been so designated effective 7 May 1967

2, Although such designation under present statutes 1s viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeut such
a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An
appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may
have in connection with your destgnation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced
Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters,

3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the

benefits of thé Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy

“decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive @

higher annulty under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus,
you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor In deciding whether you regard your
designation as a participant advcrse to your best interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career
Service Panel

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion of Mr,
Joseph S, Piccolo

1. It ls recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted
from GS-7 to GS-8, He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960
and was assigned to what is now the Special Affairs Staff (formerly ..__.. .
Task Force W) on 27 August 1962. t

2, As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo
was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency
policy precluding multiple grade promotions prevented his being con-
sidered for GS-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July
1960, On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion
to G8-8 ata time -when he was expected to leave the Agency in order
to comply with his obligation for military service. The recommendation
was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited,
Mr. Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1961 and
27 August 1962 when he returned to the Agency and began working in
the CI Branch of the Special Affairs Staff,

3. Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI
operations and is one of the most promising younger men in the CI
Branch, His performance since returning from military service has
been superior in all respects,

4, Iam happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for oo

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.
WASHINGTON 235, D. G.

Appticant Information
Sheet No. 1

To all persons “apptyig for employment
with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in upplying for employment or consultant
status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed
beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the”
conditions stated BeTaws

ations:

The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

1.
Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:
a, "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
such. intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies
as relate to the national security;

b, "to make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the coordination of such intelligence activitics of the depart-
ments and ugencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;
, "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination
of such intelligence within the Government... i

d, "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National
Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

e. "to perform such other functions and dutics related to
intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may from time to time direct."



\
The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency
to maintain correspondingly special employment criteric which may be
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Governs
ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res~
ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency, It follows that the
investigation of applicants, prerequisite to their acceptance is a time.
consuming process which,: in addition to loyalty and security checks,
includes evaluation of competence, ¢hysical and emotional fitness, and
availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered,
This {6 called "clearance" of an applicant,

2, Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance ~ perhaps something of which the applicant is genuincly unaware,
perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency
make unacceptable, In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-
clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, und no stutement of
specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3, Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not « right upon
which an applicant can insist, Offer of employment which is subject to full
clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an
unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency, Acceptance
of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,
taken with the knowledge that « very substantial percentage of applicants
are not cleared,

Statement of Understanding
Agreement

Thave read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid=
erations, If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations,

have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

Subject was advised this date that the Agency would request a

end advised not to contact his local board andy will not contact him.
He was sent to see Captain Noble in Reserve Affaira Branch. Captain Noble
‘was not in and subject was interviewed by Sgt. MacKenzie. I talked to
MacKenzie and stressed the fact that subject chould’ be advised to be sure
to drop out of the National Guard. MacKenzie said that he would have to
request to be put ina staniby reserve status. This seems to be a satis
factory arrangement, since we are requesting a directed dbferwent, the L.B.

requests for guidance, CI file reviews, and other forms of CI support, than any of our
other area division coordinators... On the other hand, because af his in-depth, across
the board knowledge of LA's operational activities, he represents a unique resource
to C/CI when the latter has to respond knowledgeably and rapidly to inquires from the

This Fitness Report is one of the most thorough and balanced from a substantive
view which I have reviewed in some time, I find it to be accurate from my perspective

The most impressive aspect of Mr. Piccolo's performance and one deserving
special mention in this fitness report_is his ability with the written word.

This is an end of: tour report covering the fourteen months in
which this Officer has been under my supervision., Station
has just submitted its first Statement of Accompliskcent Goals under
the newly-established MRO reporting system and schedule. Consequently,
this report combines Subject's duties as specified in two previous
LOI's which run from 1 June 1974 to 30 May 1975 and from 1 June 1975
through 31 July 1975. The duties listed are therefore broader than
those to be reflected in the ‘latest LOI now being forsulated as a
logical adjunct to the new MBO format and content.

(") (On specific duties No. 5 and 6, there is so little content

or substance associated with these duties as to make a Letter Rating
meaningless. The target in is practically non-
existent and there is no current need for technical operations to

support approved operational activities. The duties are listed only

because they were included in the LOI.)

DUTY NO. 1

Responsible for the operational program against the
and target, this officer handles agents and a
agent in a highly proficient manner.

his several stints as ACOS (during COS illness which required
hospitalization and medical consultations out of country),
Subject really shone in his performance. He was obliged to
deal with tho most difficult lever encountered by
this rater, and represented and protected Station interests
with skill and dignity.

Subject requires little supervision, by virtue of his
thorough knowledge and extensive experience in practically
every aspect of the mechanics of clandestine operations in
Latin America. His avocation is “Administration, in the full
sense of the word, and he administers his work load impeccably.
The assignment just completed was his first command job, and he
has acquired the additional managerial shills necessary for him
to progress in his career. There is no question of his
additional potential, and it is natural to envision him as 8
Deputy Chief of Station at a. larger Latin. American Station,

I concur in this excellent rating in all respects. The perform- .

ance of this fine officer has been superior,

He played a crucial role

at the Base,
for growth,

He is a strong considerate supervisor with potential

The failure to get out

during

tho past year (¥.am not familiar with previous experience) can be
partly attributed to immersion in the complex, time consuming
surfacing/disposal casu, but must also be attributed partly to his

Subject is an excellent operational manager and agent
handler who gots the best out of his assets. He is probably not
so strong as an. operational starter and developer and this appears
to bo duo in part to an instinct to avoid exposure and eschow the
wklad hand. On the other hand, he has undertaken rather
difficult operations starting trom scratch during
the past six months and has at least proven that he can do this kind
of work when it is necessary. In both these cases he may have
-triod to move too fast in order to reach bofore.
his departure but this is understandable. His written work is f
woll conceived and conscientious and perhaps even somewhat above
averago for case officers of his grade and experience. Like most
BKHERALD officors, however, he docs not take sufficient pains to
achieve simple, clear, forceful expression with the result that,
while-shis best efforts are effective his second best is apt to
result in lack of organization and clarity. He should work on this -
& suggestion might be that he practico avoiding metaphors and
adopt a straight declarative sentence style.

If conclusion, Subject's performance has been first class
in tho most important respects and his relatively minor weaknesses
are not incurable. He should have an excellent futuro as a senior
caso officer and supervisor, particularly if he attacks and cures
these weaknesses. if{is overall performance in his present tour

has boon very strong indeed.

CGuuENTS OF WE ViCwING OFFICIAL.
The reviewing officer concurs in the comments of the rater. I have

observed this officer closely during his tour at tho Station. He
has largely overcome a tondency to freewheol somewhat and shows an

increasing willingness to accept guidance from more experienced
officers. Compared with other officers of the same grade at this
‘Station, it is my belief that his overall performance, should be

rated O rather than S$,

In the Station's.view he is a ydung officer who should advance
steadily and with more experience should be able to handle a demanding
jassignment.

Significant strengths and- weaknesses and their relationship to
overall performance in the Operations Course. This section amplifies
and explains, ao necessary, the rating letters given above.

Mr. Hecolo's performance throughout the course celdoa deviated
from the "Proftelent" level. liia strongest chowlnga were frequently in
,areas wiiere he use knowledge cained from previous Ageney experience
{together with hig naturel ability to get along with people tn face-to-face
{cituations. le excelled fn agent handling because he male an extra

jeffort to cetnblish and maintain rapport, was competent in solving

(operational mininistration and cupport matters with a minisum of guidance,
land in establishing clanteatina

hortcomings, however, arose in other arcas because ho
‘occasionally rélied too mich on his ability to improvise, rather than
to apend extra tims in analyzing, planning ant otherwise preparing for

agent mectings.
Mr. Plecolo easily recognized lenda of operational or intelligence

value, and as the course progressed, displayed marked improvement in
hia writing of cables, dispatches and reports.

Mr. Piccolo acquired a more than satisfactory knowladge of the
principles and techniques taught during the course.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Employee returned to duty with the Agency in September 1962 after com-
pleting a tour of military duty, At that time he was assigned to TFW/CL.
Although employee expressed a desire to work in operations at that time, he
agreed to perform the duties outlined in Section B, He was called upon to
perform these duties because of the dire need within TFW/CI for someone
with his talents to establish and manage Branch systems for mail routing-
control.and files. Employee was promised an operational assignment as
goon as thé systems were established and functioning in an orderty and
efficient manner. Employee has performed his dutiee exceptionally well
and has established systems for mail routing-control, and files for the
Branch which are functioning well, It 1s strongly recommended that this
employee be assigned to duties of an operational nature and relieved from
his present duties as soon as possible, Employee has the capability of assuming

more and greater responsibility.

Since many things other than aptitudes enter into the determination of training course

whose performance {8 poorer than expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION, MMIOP FXIFR EF OWITE

training and in interpreting language training results, For example, the number of ian-

learning experiance are factors not measured by the tests but are indicative of protatie
succese in learning » foreign language. Whether such experience was in the samo languace st

SUBJECT 2 Acknowledgnent of Evaluation Boant Functional Category

REFERENCE : Evaluation Roard Precepts for Your Grade

1. Based upon an examination of your past assignments and duties,
and after considering Likely future assimmments, you have been placed
(subject to your signature below) in the functional category uG__for
Evaluation Board purposes. Precise definitions of this category are
contained in the Fvaluation Beard precepts for your:grade. This nlace-
ment is made in order that your performance, ereathsorential and ~
career planning mav be judced against officers similarly: placed pro-
fessionally, YOU ARF URGED TO STUY 11 NSIDER YOUR OWN
CASE CAREFULLY.

-
2. In general, you should consider the folloving;

a. Categories are sharply defined. Competition
is within categories, not between then. Thus,
a weak B/OG performance is not strengthened
by reclassifving it as B/0S.

b. A change in category after sustained performance
in a different category may cause a temporary
loss of momentum in your career advancement
until you have demonstrated proficiency in your
new assignment.

c. A category change should not be initiated for
th» period of a temporary, training or rotational
assignment unless a permanent change of career
track will follow,

3. If you believe that this is not the correct category for
you because the substantive nature of your Job more closely arproxi-
mates another category or because you have made a permanent change
of career track, please take the matter up through your command channel
to secure the cencurrence of vour component of assiymment or of vour
home base component, as Bo eee to a change of vour catecory.
Previously assigned and acknowledeed categories will remiin in effect
until a fully executed acknowledgrent of change is received hy the
Career Management Staff.

4, Please sign and date this notification in the space provided
and retum it to vour Personnel Evaluation and Management Officer or to

MEMORANDUM FOR! Chief, LA Division

SUBJECT t Mr. Juseph S. Piccolo - Completion of Sénior
Operations Course 02/76

1, Me. Plecolo attended the Senior Operations Course from } November
to 12 December 1975 (SOC #2/76). Individual student grades and class rankings
have act been used to evaluate student performance. The diverac background of
the students and the nature of the course material used in the SOC preclude
formal testing. This memorandum attests to Mr. Plecolo’s satisfactory comple=

tfon of the course. -

2. During the six weeks of the course, 59% of the time was devoted to
subjects and activities directly related to operations, including 30% devoted
to "hands-on" time with technical equipment and “on-the-street" practice of
tradccraft. 31% of the time was devoted-to mater{nl broadly categorized as
“ops management," including about 10% on the Soviet and China targets. The:
final 10% of the time was, devoted to subjects categorized as "management over~:
view and ops. support," which consisted of mectingn with DO division and staff :
chiefs and visits to labs and other ops support’ facilities tn the Headquarters
area, The officers in the class ranged in grade from GS-12 to GS-14
(average grade 12.9), average age was 43.6 (Mr. Plccolo's age {s 40). The
class members’ average: years of Agency service was 16.8, and their average

years of overseas service was 9.2.

3. The six weeks, normally 30 days of instruction time, wis shortened ~
to 28 days by the Thankagiving Day weekend. Of these 28 days, Mr, Piccolo ceneetn
spent six days in intensive training in Persuasion and Manipulation Skills

taught He_spent app other eight and one-half
daya on technical tradecraft

and usage) and street tradecraft

etc.) including three days intensive practice of these skilla in a live

exerciae conducted “Another five daya were spent at Headquarters
meeting with the chiefa of all Do divisions and staff, and visiting three
operational support laboratortes in the metropolitan area. The approximately
eight and one-half remaining days were consumed by a combination of miscel-
lancous operations management subjects, student seminars, and term paper
writing (though the latter was accomplished mostly on the atudenta’ own timo).
This running of the course waa keynoted by remarks by the ADDO, and the
Headquarters week was climaxed by an hour and a half with the DDO. The guest
speaker at the graduation dinner of SOC #2/76 was Agency Historian

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo - Completion of Senfor Operations Course #2/76

4, Wr. Piccolo, as a 40-year-vld CS-13/4, was ot about the average age
for thin class and slightly above average in grade. Although formal grades
are not given to graduates of the SOC, it was the consensus of DTS staff
Instructors involved in SOC 2/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly
rank number one in this particular group. Bringing to the class broad opera-
tional experience and understa: Mr. Piccolo was an active participant in
the six-day jand made contributions based on his own
operational past. The tradecraft instructors Who conducted the live problem

described Mr. Piccolo as the best student in street tradecraft.
One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo, "exhibited, more
than any of the others,-the ability to lead the group.” Mr. Piccolo's term
paper on the subject
was careful and thorough and was described by the panel as "an excellent overall :
plan.“ To a man of Mr. Piccolo’s experience, at least some of the course may L
have-seemed a little basic or redundant, but he never let it show, and always |
took part with the same enthusiasm as the more junior members of the class.

5. A copy of this menorandum is being placed in Mr. Piccolo's offictal
personnel file. :
