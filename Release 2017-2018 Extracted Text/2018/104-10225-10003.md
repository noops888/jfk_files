Dear Joseph,

Clcrical DO Personnel Evaluation Boards from 17 April

through 19 May 1978.

I well recognize the complexities involved in the

comparative craluation of

clerical carcerists

a task further complicated by this being only the second

year it has been undertaken.

Your deliberations were

vital to the Directorate's determination to bring to this

group of valuable employees the advantages of the merit

Full-time service with the Evaluation Boards

represents

major

contribution to the Dircctorate's

of personnel

assessment and management.

Not

only were your promotion recommendations valued,

but

recommendations for carcer

development and training

were also extremely helpful.

I believe that your service on the Board broadened

and sharpened your own focus

on personnel aspects of

Agency management.

Too, I think that the time spent

in this endeavor could only have made you better

of our need for complete, carcful and candidly written

appraisals of our employces.

Sincerely,

NcMahon

Deputy Director sor operazions

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services Career

Service Panel

SUBJECT

: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr.

Joseph S. Piccolo .

It Is recommended that Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo be promoted

from GS-7 to GS-8. He has been in grade GS-7 since 19 July 1960

and was assigned to what is now the Special Affairs Stall (formerly

Task Force T) on 27 August 1962.

%. As long ago as 16 June 1960 when he was a GS-6 Mr. Piccolo

was considered to have merited promotion to GS-9, but an Agency

policy precluding multiple grade promotions provented his being con-

sidered for GB-9 at that time. He was promoted to GS-7 on 19 July

1960. On 4 May 1961 Mr. Piccolo was recommended for promotion

to G8-8 at a time when he was expected to leave the Agency in order

to comply with his obligation for military service.

The recommendatlon

was not approved on the grounds that promotion spaces were limited.

Mr, Piccolo served in the Air Force between 4 October 1961 and

27 August 1092 when he returned to the Agency and began working in

the Cl Branch of the Special Affairs Staff.

Mr. Piccolo has demonstrated an aptitude for CI and FI

operations and is one of the most promising younger men in the CI

Branch. His performance since returning from military service has

been supertor in all respects.

1. I am happy to recommend Mr. Piccolo for promotion.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY...

WASHINGTON 25, D. G.

Applicant Information

Sheet No. 1

To all persons applying for employment.

with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant

Blatus with the Central Intelligence Agency.

No applicition may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below:

General Considerations:

1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

á, "40 advise the National Security Council in matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Guvernment departments and agencies

as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Government. . . ;

d. "90 perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence

agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National

Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may from time to time direct."

---

## Page 91

14-00000

The special character

of this national responsibility requires the Agency

to maintain correspondingly speci.. employment criteric which may be

different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern-

ment departments and agencies which do noe hire the highly sensitive res-

ponsilmlity borne by the Control Intelligence Agency. le follows that the

Investigation of applicanes, prerequisite lo their acceplance do i time-

consuning process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks,

includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitners, nd

avallability of a suitable position at such pime as employment may be offered.

This la called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware,

perhape something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency

make unacceptable. In ony event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-

clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, und no statement of

specific reasons is made 8o the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is nut i right upon

which an applicant can insise. Offer of employment which is subject to full

clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an

unsuccessful ipplicant grounds for any claim against the Agency, Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,

taken with the knowledge that i very substantial percentage of applicants

are not cleared.

Stitsinent of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid

erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.

I have also seen and read Ayplicant Information Sheet No. 2.

over the past fourteen months under my supervision,

it would

be necessary to point to a weak showing in operational and

particularly he could have spons more

purposes.

In his regular work hours, however,

which included some nights and weekends, he wis more than

gainfully employed in the accomplishment of his assigned

duties. He is not a clock-watcher, but stays with the

Jas well as with the paperwork until thoy

are completed.

This Officer is the victim of personnel requirements,

which has resulted in an Organizational fallure to challenge

his talents and ingenuity.

His re-assignment to the Cuban

Operations Section next,

for example, will be his fifth

assignment in that arca

In 15 years.

It is recommended that

he obtain rotational experience in another geogriphical or

He is handling a. sensitive PBRU-IN.[

lease in a most professioml manner.

His operational reporting, is exemplary and his writin, style, once soment cotuse, has

shown steady improvement.

Despite a relatively short period in the role of field case

officer, he has won the admiration ant respect of calleggues and agent assets alike.

He has a winning way with people - a reflection of his sincere interest in them. He

has a high degree of initlative and drive, 1s Imginafive and resourceful. In operationa

he shows a welcome degree of agresolveness. His surervisory ability, except as exercised

notrectly through others, has not yet been sufficiently nut to the test to emble the

rating officer to make a determination, but it appears that he already rossesses the

essentials of a good supervisor.

of these has not let up in any way in his work.

Inleed, one wonders what he would be

capable of if he were in perfect health piven the hich level of performance to date.

It 1s a pleasure for the ratine officer to go on record as stating that never

COMMENTS OF REVIIMINO OFFICIAL

The reviewing officer concurs in the conments of the rater. I have

observed this officer closely during his tour nt the Station. He

has largely overcome & tondency to freewleol somewhat and shows an

Increasing willingness to accopt kuidance from more experienced

officers.

Compared with othor officors of the same biade nt this

Station, it 1g my belief that his overall performance slould be

rated O rathor than S.

In the station's view he

is a young officer who should advance

stcadily and

more exporience should be able to handle a demanding

assignment.

Employce returned to duty with the Agency In September 1962 after com-

pleting a tour of military duty. At that time he was assigned to TFW/CI.

Although employce expressed a desire to work in operations at that time, he

agreed to perform the duties outlined in Section B. He was called upon to

perform these duties because of the dire necd within T FW/CI for someone

with his talents to establish and manage Branch systems for mall routing-

control and Miles.

soon as the systems were established and functioning in an orderty and

efficient manner.

Employee has performed his dutlee exceptionally well

his present dutles as soon as possible. Employee has the capability of assuming

officer on cortain sensitive and complicared clandestine operatite.

Ile has performed

these dutica in i auperior fashion, It la my unqualified opinion that Mr. Piccolo

should receive at least a tro-grade promotion immediately. Howevor it is

recognized that thia is contrary to current Agency policy and therefore it is strongly

recommendod that he be promoted to the grade of GS-7 Immediately. Mr. Piccolo

is intelligent and extremely industrious.

He has worked long hours performing a

variety of Important tasks. It is my opinion that Mr. Piccolo has the attributes

required of career personnel working in the Foreign Intelligenco arca and that he

should bo pormitted to have his career designation changed to Fl.

also be given the opportunity to receivo Agency training so that he might be better

qualified to porform lasks in this area of activity. There is no question that he would

become a professional case olficer.

The Section C rating has been given after careful

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, LA Division

SUBJECT

1.

Mr. Piccolo attended the Senior Operations Course from 3 November

to 12 December 1975 (SOC 02/76). Individual student grader and class rankinga.

have not been used to evaluate acudent performance. The diverne background of

che students and the nature of the course material uned in the SOC preclude

formal testing.

Ilon of the course.

2.

During the six weeks of che coursc, 59% of the time was devoced to

aubjects and activitles directly related to operations, Including 30% devoted

to

"hands-on" time with cechnical equipmont and "on-the-atreet" practice of

tradecraft.

31% of the time was devoted to materinl broadly categorized as

"ops manngement," Including about 10% on the Sovlet and China targets.

The :

final 10% of the time

was. devoted to subjecta categorized ns "management over

view and ops aupport," which conslated of moetings with Do diviaion and staff

chiefs and visica to labs and ocher ops aupport facilities in the Headquarters

area.

The officera in the class ranged in grade from GS-12 to 6S-14

(average grade 12.9), nverage age was 43.6 (Mr. Plecolo's age la 40).

The

class members' overage years of Agency service was 16.8, and their average

years of overscas service was 9.2.

3.

The six wecks, normally 30 doys of Inatruction time, was shortened

to 28 days by the Thanksgiving Day weekend.

Of chose 28 days, Mr.

Piccolo

spent afx days in intensive training in Persuasion and Manipulation Skills as

taught

He spent approximately another eight and one-half

days on technical tradecrate

and usage) and atreet tradecraft

Jetc.) Including three days Intensive practice of chese skills in a live

exercise conducted L

"Another fIve days were spent at Headquartera

meeting with che chiefs of all DO diviatons and staffs, and visiting three

opcrational support laboratortes in che metropolitan area.

The approximtoly

eight and one half remaining days were consumed by a combination of miacel

lancous operations management subjects, student seminars, and term paper

writing (though the latter was accomplished montly on the students' own time).

This running of the course was keynoted by remarks by the ADDO, and the

Hendqurters week was climaxed by an hour and a half with the DDO.

SUBJECT: Mr. Joseph S. Piccolo • Completion of Senior Operations

Course 82/76

Mr. Piccolo, as a 40-year-old CS-13/4, was at about the average age

for this class ond alightly above nverage in grade.

Although formal grades

are not selven to graduates of the SOC, it was the

consensus of DTS staff

Instructors Involved In SOC 02/76 that Mr. Piccolo would almost certainly

ranie number one in thia particular group.

Elonal experience and understanding, Mr. Piecolo was an

Bringing to the class broad opera-

active participant in

the six-dayl

and made contributions based on his own

The tradecraft Instructors who conducted the live problem

described Mr. Piccolo as the best student in street tradecraft.

One of the Course Coordinators commented that Mr. Piccolo,

"exhibited, more

than any of the others, the ability to lead the group."

Mr. Piccolo's term

paper on the subject

was eareful and thorough and was deseribed by the panel as "an excellent overall

plan " To a man of Mr. Piccolo"s experience, at least some of the course may

have seemed a litcle basle or redundant, but he never let it show, and always

took pare with the sane enthustaem as the more junior members of the class.

A copy of this memorandum is being placed in Mr. Piccolo'a official

personnel file.
