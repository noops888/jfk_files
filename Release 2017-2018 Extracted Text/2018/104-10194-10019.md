to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore
more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts
than in that of more than s.ort-range operational development.
Subject's operational. situation makes it impossible for him to
attempt recruitments. Thus, his very real achievements are not
by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to
be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity
of the leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to
“digest” the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,
fe has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful
with operational expenses and has exercised good security.

Ducting the period under review, additional efforts have been
made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him
further in the work of the station component with which he works.
He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs
directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

Section D (continued)

substantial. In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,
although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred
an "S" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately
deserve an "0", but it does net seem warranted at the present time.
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the category, rather than "Ss",
but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a
frequent basis.

In sum, is superb, and’only time will reveal to

what extent the equirements permit a full measure on be-
half of i Ton. We are following this aspect ‘closely

and will be commenting upon it subsequently, as we gain experience
and knowledge.

from the Organization, his Continued presence at this Station definitely
appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite
conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat
Jonger period than that reflected by this report,

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to
direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more
aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediat¢ proximity

to the primary Station targets, This officer does bring man: talents to bear
on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent! a solid and

greater

and a vast range of contacts in the local community,
Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in
depth, sclect those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue

tucin actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina,
tion from further development, for whatever reason,

In sum, in spite of the recognized and commendable.improvement in this
officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits
that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would, more properly have
been a'"P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately
be set at a level between "P" and "S"', probably closer to the former than

the latter,

Thie reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared
