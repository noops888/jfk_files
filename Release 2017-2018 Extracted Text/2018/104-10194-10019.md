more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts

than in that of more than

_sort-range operational development.

Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to

attempt recruitments.

Thus, his very rezl achievements are not

by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to

be copious.

He could, however, further improve the selectivity

of the

leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to

"digest" the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,

he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility.

tle is careful

with operational expenses

and has exercised good security.

During the period under

review, additional efforts have been

made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him

further in the work of the station component with which he works.

He is

In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,

although our initial lipressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred

an "s" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately

deserve an

"O", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.

Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have

been ir the higher range of the "p" category, rather than

"s",

• Section D3 continued

from the Organization, his continued presence at this Station definitely

appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite

conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat

longer period than that reflected by this report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to

direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more

aggressive. efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity

to the primary Station targets.

This officer does bring many talents to bear

on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent

a solid and

and a vast range of contacts in the local community.

Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in

depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue

then actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina-

tion from further development, for whatever reason.

In sum,

in spite of the recognized and commendable improvement in this

officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits

that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would more properly have

been &"P", and that the ovcrall rating, at this point, would more accurately

be set at a level between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than

the latter.

Thie reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared

Since the Revieving Officer in the field has not indicated his views

on this Fitness Report,

I would like to make a comment of my own.

wishing to detract fron anything the Supervisor has said about Subject's per-

that the ratings given him in this report are

higher than those given, for example, to any Branch Chief in

this Division, and,

as such, are inconsistent with the grading pattern of the Division as a whole.

from the point of view of supervision, this employee in his present position re-

quires guidance only insofar as to identify specifie targets and for him to protect

himself in situations where he does not have, by virtue of his not having access to

official files, specialized Information. Otherwise, he requires no supervision

other-than the periodic provision of policy and operational directives.

This employee has always been conscious and punctillious in his preparation of

operational and administrative reports, including financial accountings, and his

reporting in general, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing

the risks inherent in the lack of access to classified storage, leaves nothing to

be desired.

Other than the funds for operational activities, this employee currently has no

responsibility. for the programing and

use of personnel, space, equipment, and

funds.

With respect to dedication to his Job, this employee has practically speaking

• His dedication

to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge ofthis assignment,

and his willingness

to continue on in 1t, deserve particular mention, particularly since he would per

haps Justifiably feel that his present assignment may leave him outside the main-

stream of competitive organization progression.

This employee's health and family situations leave nothing to be desired, as his

proven mobility in"the execution of operational assignments attests.

It should further be noted that with respect to the problom endemic to

While this employee's assignment to date has essentially been a one-man show, it

The assignment of this employee to the field

was designed

to compensate for the loss of an employee in an

slot which ras cut from the Station"s

_allotment of soreonnel positions.

During the reportine period thia amployee has accomplished with success

uring the reporting period he has devoloped a wide circle of contact:

n the scientific and journalistic fields and applies a long, background 1r

a variety of assignments in KUDOVE to the determination and assessment of

operational potential among these contacts. At the same time his

This empioyes requires & minimam of detailed operational supervision;

it Is necessary in

specifio cases only to indicate the operational or infor

mational objectivea.

From the point of view of administrative support, his attention to

detall and meticulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station

to a minimum.

This employee uses thel

language continuously, and his facility

1s such as to permit him to handle himself excellently. in a broad rango of

complex technical subjects. He has in addition undertaken specialized

language training, to develop this capability further.

His operational re-

porting is excellent both with regard to clarity and pertinence.

In the immediate future he will be assigned case work, for the most

part in fields viere it will complement, and be complemented by, his in-

dependent operational

Subject has excellent natural equipment for employment in this organization in

terns of his intelligence and natural apptitudes.

Additionally, he brings a

great deal of area knowledge and language ability to his present sasigment.

vuring the perlod covered by this report he has displayed great industry and

devotion to duty in a varlity of circumstances and achieved notable results

In production and in the creation of both short and long-tem assets for his

unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat too businesslike in

many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless.

This, however,

Is a quality which he does not permit to intrude upon the necessities of his

operational work although It often shows in office relationships.
