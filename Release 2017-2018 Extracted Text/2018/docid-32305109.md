the CAVALLARO home at 164 Rosiyn Ds., Youngstown,

the car and the brick garage, was not higher than three feet from

the level of the ground in any place, as all was completely

demolished,

The blast also blew a hole in the concrete floor of

the garage to a depth of two feet.

Had DITTA been in the car or in the garage as he

stated,

he too would have been blown up with the

victims.
