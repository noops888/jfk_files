.It igs to be noted the CAVALLARO bombing took place. at

the level of the ground in any place, as all vias completely’
demolished, The blast also blew a hole in the. concrete. floor of.

_ the garage to a depth of two feet.

Had DITTA been in the car or in the garage as he
stated, he too would have been blown up with the victims. DITTA
also mentioned CAVALLARO coming from the right, which would have-~™
been true, however he méntioned CAVALLARO with a flashlight, “which
would not have been necessary at that time “in the morning. It is”
true, people would have been coming home from work at 6:00 o'clock,
and it would have been dark at that time, showld Hé have sét the”
bomb.on the night of 11/21/62, however, the bombing’ would not havé

is to be noted Roslyn Drive is a rather narrow residential
street, and buses do not use this street for travel,
