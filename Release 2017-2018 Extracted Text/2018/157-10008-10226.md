His January 17, 1975 Memorandum to Colby

His memorandum was written pursuant to a request from DCI

Colby for any information that related to current allegations con-

cerning questionable CIA activities. He had never told anyone other than

and the Cuban pilot about the matter until then.

According to Murray, the atmosphere in Havana was bombastic.

"We were alert to the Cubans' attitude towards us. We knew that the

Cuban

Security Service was Interested in identifying CIA agents in

Cuba."

Among the people, he said, were those both very friendly and

very hostile to the u.s.

The opposition to Castro was, at that

time, very disorganized.

The Pilot

The pilot was introduced to Murray by the pilot's cousin.

General assistance to the CIA by the pilot was offered. The Cuban

was

aware he had been identified as pro-Castro and anti-U.S. by

Castro forces in Havana and he wanted to let the U.S. know that that

was an inaccurate characterization. So he requested the rendezvous.

He volunteered to help the agency in any way possible and agreed to

accept stringent reporting requirements.

On July 18, 1960, after the contact had been established, the

Cuban pilot contacted Murray and told Murray that he was to pilot a

chartered plane to Prague to pick up Raul Castro Ruz and his official

party. He sought instructions from the agency as to what intelli

Murray Inmediately cabled Headquarters

for instructions -= "I sought assistance from headquarters re

additional requirements." The Cuban Branch (WH 4) would have

(

recieved his request. He asked for instructions re use of the pilot.

Neither the pilot nor Murray suggested of intimated the possibility

of assassinating Raul Castro.

They were thinking in terms of simple

hard intelligence If flight information concerning a denied country:

Jas aware of Murray's relationship with the pilot

quarters responded with a cable that made Murray "swallow hard" when

he received it.

"It left me rather

surprised to say the least.

That cable said that headquarters was seriously considering the "remov=

al" of Cuba's top three leaders.

(A blow-up of that July 21, 1960

cable (98941) shows that all authorizing signatures on the cable are

chose of E. H. Hinkle.)

Murray had never heard such proposals or plans or plots dis-

cussed at theslavana station or elsewhere.., Indeed, he had not

spoken tol

persons above or below

bout such things.

"Not only was I surprised, but I considered the possibility of chis

Individual (the pilot) executing this, type of mission was negligible."

But he didn't question the order when'

*delivered him the

cable.o

he said, was equally surprised by the statement in

the cable. This cable represented "quite a departure from the con-

ventional activittes we'd been asked to handle." When the cable was

received there was a minimum of time (approximately fifteen minutes)

to tell the pilot of the request for action by Headquarters.

He met

che pilot at a pre-determined spot and spoke to him. He wanted to

avoid the use of words like "kill" and 'assassinate" and so he "talked

in terms of an accident to neutralize this leader's influence."

But

the pilot understood the meaning "loud and clear."

The Cuban was

serious, thoughtful and then became imaginative in terms of

possibilities.

They spoke for 30 to 35 minutes while the pilot

drove to the airport.

When he returned to the station, Murray discovered a cable

from Headquarters, signed by Tracy Barnes which

said to "DROP MATTER."

It 1200

of

course, too late to "drop the matter" so all he and

buld do was hope that the pilot would not be successful in

"accidentally" crashing the plane and.kflling Raul Castro et al.

The combined reaction of Murray and

to this abrupt turn about or flip-

flop on the part of Headquarters on such a sensitive matter was one

of incredulity.

"What's going on in headquarters was our reaction."

"It showed inadequate coordination at headquarters prior to release

of the first cable."

Moreover, such a turn-about was unprecedented

In his, Murray's, experience.

In his opinion, Hinkle would be the best

person

to explain the activities surrounding the "removal" cable.

Murray also noted that he had no personal contact with J.C. King on

this matter and said that

gould have done any briefing of King on

Cuban matters.

He did not know whether

Thad ever raised the issuel.

of the reversal of position in the two cables with King or any other

higher official of the agency.
