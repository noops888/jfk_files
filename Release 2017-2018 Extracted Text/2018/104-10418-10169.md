This afternoon I talked with Chris Winkle re David Martin's request for

documents related to the Angleton case.

His comments were as follows:

Martin obviously got his act together from the Stipulation of Dismissal

document on file with

the U.S. District Court in Alexandria. (The copy of the

Stipulation of Dismissal we had on file in our Litigation folder did not include

the''Exhibit A" referred to in paragraph one of the Stipulation. ). "Exhibit A"

was the 20 March 1979 letter to Angleton's lawyer, Chabot, from

"Ernest

Mayerfeld, outlining the specific items in the litigation that Angleton would

"be allowed access to", (ie had a copy of it but no indiention it was "Exhibit A")

Don't answer his initial request any sooner than necessary.

When we

do, deny release of the information, maintaining it is still classified and

involves protection of sources and methods, (b)(1)(b)(3) of FOIA.

It he appeals we will worry about it later.

But there's no denying that Martin knows of the existence of the specific

documents.

Chris said that

is sending out an interim response from

Eleanor

I spoketo lou D. and reafirmed that what we are proposing

to do

is to deny these documents to Martin even though some of them

were

previously prepared for release in sanitize form to Angleton in litigation.

We acknowledged that if it had not. been for OGC's release of three documents

to Angleton without coordination with the DO we would have "Glomarized"

Angleton's request. A

"Glomar" response is also not possible to Martin for

the same reasons pinsxthux but also beeause exhibit ASon file in u.s.

Distric Court in Alexandra and that exhibit lists the documents that Martin

is requesting. The proposal now is to list and deny the documents to

Martin under

(b) (1). and

I (b) (3) Of FOIA.
