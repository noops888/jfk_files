‘Martin under (b) (1), and (b)(3) of FOIA.

BAL a 31 May 1979

S
Brad. (YK 2

This afternoon I talked with Chris Winkle re David Martin's request for
documents related to the Angleton case.

His comments were as follows:

Martin obviously got his act together from the Stipulation of Dismissal
document on file with the U.S. District Court in Alexandria. (The copy of the
Stipulation of Dismissal we had on file in guy Litigation folder did not include
the"Exhibit A" referred to in paragraph one of the Stipulation.) "Exhibit A"
was the 20 March 1979 letter to Angleton's lawyer, Chabot, from “Ernest
Mayerfeld, outlining the specific items in the litigation that Angleton would
"be allowed access to". Cute had = eapy of H bet ne indication “Hh was "Eehibit A”)

Don't answer his initial request any sooner than necessary. When we
do, deny release offthd“information, maintizining it is still classified and
involves protection of sources and methods, (b)(1)(b)(3) of FOLA.

If he appeals we will worry about it later.

But there's no ‘denying that Martin knows of the existence of the specific
documents, 7

(Chris said that] is sending out an interim response from
IFS.)

2 : Eleanor 5

{ spoketo Lou D, and reafirmed that what we are proposing to do
is to deny these documents to Martin even though some of them were
previously prepared for release in sanitize form to Angleton in litigation.
We acknowledged that if it had not. been for OGC's release of three documents
to Angleton without coordination with the DO we would have "Glomarized" .
Angletoa's request. A "Glomar" response is also not possible to Martin for
the same reasons piusxtkex but also beaause exhibit Aon file in U.S.
Distric Court in Alexandra and that exhibit lists the documents that Martin
is requesting. The proposal now is to list and deny the documents to.

pending settlement offer in the above-captioned litigation.
The offer outstanding is for your client,.James J. Angleton,
to be allowed access to the records mentioned in our 9 March
1979 letter to you, viz

employed for the purpose of representing the Central
Intelligence Agency in testimony before the House
Assassinations Committee (This document has previously
been released to Mr. Angleton with some deletions in
response to his FOIA request. Under the terms of this
offer, Mr. Angleton would be permitted to see the
unredacted version.);

2. the document by which Mr. Hart was authorized
to review agency files in preparation for the Committee
testimony (A further review of the files has resulted
in the discovery of documents which may have some
bearing on this portion of the request. These will
be made available to Mr. Angleton pursuant to the
terms enumerated in CIA's 9 March 1979 letter to you.);

3. the document setting forth the guidelines
under which Mr. Hart's testimony was given (Like the
dgcument requested per subparagraph 1 above, this
