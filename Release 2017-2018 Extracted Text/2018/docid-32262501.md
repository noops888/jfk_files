a new coffee cleaning machine; they traveled through latin

America

and introduced machine with help of l.s. Experimental Station

Guatemala in the mid-50s.

Went

into business and started

marufacturing nachine, became

very successful with it, was making

a lot of

money. -- *a decided

manufacturing plant, warehouse

and office in santiago, Cuba

-- after about a year, representatives

of Batista came around and said

the dictator wanted a cut of the

husiness, wanted

a cut of $5000

about six months later, militia

...Plí came

to Miami where his daughter was living; shortly afterwards

was contacted by representatives of Carlos

how he would like to get his business back... fellow contacted

him was named Mario (doesn't remember last

name) Lrecords: Mario

villamia,

aks Frank Guzman, Frank George, John

Jordon,

P. Castillo] ANd and fellow named Manny [Manuel Arques]...

Prio asked him if he would go to Mexico and meet a man down there...

then he explained

that he was trying

to overthrow Batista...so

he went to Mexico

and got some arms down there...that's where

he met Castro... in Tampico... Xandx a*arx*hexxxar*x*&(Houston; TExas

and they

checked in the Shamrock Hotel there;and he met Prio there

and that's when prio told him an how to find

Castro in Mexico and

RM went and stayed with Castro....that's when Castro made his

famous 26th of July raid against Cuba

("| was there the day he

took off for Cuba.

-- initially Prio was

smuggling arms to Cuba even before Castro;

RM says Castro betrayed Prio

who was supposed to take over the

goverment after Castro won the revolution...

"Prio was the money man. He got out of Cuba with a helluva lot

of money and he didn't give a damn how he spent it either.

$100,000 in cash

inside fat octor: lotta

times. "

-- Prio told him he needed

RM as the middleman in

the arms deal

needed an American; everybody who was

working forhim

was Cuba. IRM says he heard that Frank Sturgis was working for

Prio also at that time but he never met him.]

Also Prio liked

the way he got things done quickly.

CHow did Prio know you had been kicked out of Cuba and were in

Miami?)

"I don't know.

I don't know how he knew

it." [There were

no news articles ahout

it or any notoriexty.] "But I don't want

to get prio in any trouble because l believe he is one of the

finest

men ever

met.

He's

a real fine man."

Heard he lost

a bundle of money in building

condominiums

in Puerto Rico..

who worked with prio and thinks she's the one who eventually

turned them

in to the Feds...later her car was blown up but

she escaped injury..

--Eventually we transferred our base of operation

from Miami

and

Tampa because it got too hot here, they were watching us

too closely... so we changed it down to Houston, and we'd

have

the arms sent to Houston by truck, by commercial lines like

Mayflower and that, and then we bought a lot of supplies, like ropes and

blankets and stuff, down

in Houston...

":.

(Were you getting arms

mostly from the Moh?) "Mostly, yeah.

From

the mob and from... well, l'm gonna tell you something but l'm

not gonna name no

names

until

I have to.

I got them

from Senatorse

United States Senators.

(Here in Florida?) No.

(Was

he the

link to the Mob?) He was the link to the Redstone Arsenal in

She di

Arkangas.

(didn't want to talk about it anymore)

Che hasn't worked in five years, since he had an operation for

his

lungs; was working for API company, head of quality control;

was

in hosptial for 73 days; now

in

need of money.)

"That shows you how goddamn dumb l was.

Hell, I was in control;

of a lot of money, I could have

gone South with ax it but

always brought it back. Like when

l.bought this big ship, l

paid

878,000

for it. He told

me

I could have none

as hight as

$200,000. mt least i could have

told him I paid $150,000 or

5100,000

for it, but l didn't.

I was

just too damn

honest."

(All CBS paid was his expenses

to Houston: he stayed down there,

for about two weeks with Dan

Rather and this girl Harriet

Rubind

"All I was trying to do was show them how l believe that Oswald

couldn't have

acted alone.

But I can

prove everyting I say.

Like they

say that Ruby just came

to me once. He came to me

three times.

But they didn't put that in that Warren Commission!

And I told

them, that he came to me three times.

And they say

that I say I thought he was

Jack Ruby, but, hell, he told me

he was Jack Ruby. He told me his name was Rubinstein. He didn't.

say Jack Ruby, he said, 'My name is Rubinstein from Dallas.'

And he kept saying

he was gonna give me this money for a letter,!

a letter * of introduction to Castro.

But he never did come up

with the money.

He wanted me to give him this letter and tell him

in the letter what a responsible man he was and all this bullshit

and all that time l believe

he

was just finding out about me

so he

could go on over there

and tell him

that he knew me. I don't

believe.

he was ever gonna give

me money....

(To go back to gun-running operation:

Ever deal with Trafficante?)

Didn't think so, couldn't recall

the

name. Said he did have a call

from George Raft who wanted to get back in the gamblina operation

with Castro.

-- Also mentioned a Jack Porter (?), a "Mr. Republican;

campaign manager forEisenhoser (?) who contacted him

After Castro took over he got numerous calls

trom people who wanted him to contact castro on their behalt...

thinks maybe in Houston but could not remember details...thinks

he came with Che Gueverra (?)

PRECIA

QUOTTeS

(You were actually getting your arms from a U.S. Senator?)

He was the one who would tell us where to go to get them.

(Dia you actually buy them from Senators?) No, from the

Government.

Ammunition,

everything.

I was caught with

over $2 million worth.

They were in a house in Housdon.

bought this house to put them all' in, had them piled way up,

it was the damndest thing you ever saw..

The way they got caught was that he had this costa Rican boy i

come up from Costa Rice, he was a xa

radio technician. and he

was going to Houston from Miami, but it was a cold winter and

he went to Maria sol to borrow

her husband's overcoat.. and she.

dug it out of him where he was

going; and she had fallen

in love

with a lawver who was Rastista

counsel here and he she told him:

and he took her to the fBl.

Prio's people later tried to kill'

her, hlew her car up, but they didn't.)

-says he never dealt with Roselli...

his own .opinion that.Giancanna

and Hoffa were all linked

and

that

Hoffa hated Kennedy with a passion,

and maybe

he did it...

(Were you

dealing with the Teamsters when shipping arms?) Remembers

only dealing with

a guy

named Rocky up in Gainesville (now

dead),

he was a pilot.. he mentioned

he was

with Hoffa and guy before

Hoffa, Beck;

"He done a few things

for me with the airplanes.";

-Details of Oswald visit: "It was

either xade August or saxxxx

September.

Lee Harvey Oswald came to my house.

He came to my

house. Right down

in Bay Cliff, Texas.

I was married to a

teacher.

my wife after all that trouble:

A little town called Bay Cliff, †Texas. That's right between

• Houston and Dallas.

And he came down there.

He came to my house.

one Saturday morning. A boy by the name of Sam Neal was there.....

• As a matter of fact, he lived there with me.

she was a real rich woman, she had this gi big house, but

I don't want to get her

this, she didn't have nothing

to do with it, she didn't even know

l'd been in all that trouble.

As a matter of

fact, I was on probation then, when i married her.

But me and Sam were sitting there, this was Saturday morning, l

quess it

was aaks about ll o'clock.

This is what was so astounding

about this Harvey Oswald business,

I went to sit

I think he said his

name was Hernandez.

He was driving it.

(Pecall the color of the station wagon?) I think it was kinda

pinkish.

I don't know, it was

a

real light color.

But anyway;

they knocked on the door and this quy, kan dax l opened the

says's sitting downstairs, i think

My wife is upstairs, she was still upstairs and

he was

drinking a highball

or something,

I don't

know.' But

anyway,

that

was along about

August or september, l'm not

sure, maybe & before, I don!t know

what month it was, but it wasn't cold. So

1 invited him ax in,

so he came in and

he had this Spanish man with him.:

" can't say

he was a Cuban,

I can't say he was

a Mexican, i can!t say he was

a Costa Rican, I don't know what he was,' ! just know he was Latin'

I know he was

Latin.

And very few words.

He introduced him to

me, l never will forget that, his name was ternandez.

And'.he

was well dressed.

He

was a well-dressed * fella, but Harvey:

I mean Oswald, he was in shirtsleeves, but this Latin was with

a tie and everythino.

And he commenced telling me, after. lie

sit down, he said,

"Might as

well get to the

@point. it

want to!

know if you'd be interested in furnishing some arms.

Welre

gonna try to take over Salvador. (Salvador?) Down in Central

America.

san Salvador. (Oswald said this?), Oswald said this..

And | told him,

I said, now

listen, man, lemme tell you something

I'm on

five years probation, and

said

I don't have about maybe

a year to go on that damn thing and l don't want no part of no

kind of arms, no kind of nothing, nothing

to do,

I don't want to

get mixed up

in

it, I don't

want

to even talk of it. And

Sma sam is sittin'

there.

And he say, 'Well, you could make a lot

of money out of it."

And I says,

"I quess you could make, a lot

of money out of it

and you'd have to serve a lot of timerin the

goddamn

jail, too!

I can remember that, l don't

want to ever.g0

back to that

place.

So he kept

talking, kept talking. He says,

well, I know, I know I got the right

man and I know.you.can get :

me anything I want, can't you?"

And

I says, "I guess

/ could.if

I put my mind to something like that," l says,

"but I don't want"

to even discuss it."

And in the meantime l was trying to get him

out of there because my wife

was upstairs and ! didn't

want her

to know

all this

stuff, you know.

So

I finally got him

out and

he says, "Well, we'll talk to you

later."

How long were they

there?)

They was there about 20 minutes, 30 maybe, l don't know.

So they went to the car,

and they

watched

come back.

And

i seen

them through the curtains.

And they come back and they:

after I went

to the door and I stepped

back outside and he said

to me,

he said, "Now, McKeown,

can

you do me something

that

can

get this done

pretty quick and

1'11 give you quite a bit of:

money

if you can get me four

-- listen now -- four high powered automatic

rifles with telescope sights on

them. He sayd, l'll be willing to

pay as much as you want for those aux

sax guns. *ak There's taux just fol

of them, now you can do that pretty

quick now, can!† you?" He says,

"y'd be willing to go up to $10,000 for the four."

And he

specifically mentioned 300 Savage automatics with telescope sights. ri

And I, told. him, "I told you l don't want no part of this kind

of business!'

When they came back, did both of them come

back?)

Both of them came back, but this latin, he stood back.

I stepped outside and like he was standing here and the other

guy was standing there. (And

where was your friend Sam Neal at

that time?) He was still back in the house.

But the door was

open, I left the door open, he was

still sittin' on the divan,

you know, in the living room.

But he was sitting there while

we discussed this while they were both inside.

He was there.

And that was the big thing, you see, because Dan Rather, he went

to Houston to talk to Sam, and Sam

told him it was definitely.y

Lee Harvey Oswald that came, definitely * he was the man who

came and he says, 'I'll swearito

it, that Lee Härvey Oswald washe

the man who came to talk to Mac." So he left, him and this guy.

that's the reason I know this other guy drove

the car because.'

I seen them, you know, when they

left, they pulled up in my.

driveway and turned a around. I lived an right on the water?

(Do you recall whether they had Texas plates?) No, ! don't.

In them days you didn't think nothing about

a person was gonna

kill the President.

All I wanted to do was to get

them the

hell away. (Wasn't it Rambler that used to make a pinkish

color car?) I couldn't tell you for sure what kind of carit

was.

I knew it was a station wagon, a light colored station.

wagon. I don't think it was a brand new car, but I don't know

(Have a roof rack on it?)

I think it did.

That's one of them

things that goes around the top for the luggage?

I think.it

did, but I'm not sure. Then they got back in the car, did

Hernandez get back in to drive?)

That's right.

And Oswald

got in the front seat?)

He got in the front seat.

How was...

this Hernandez built. Taller than Oswald?)

I won't say"

1748,

he was taller. I think they was both about the same sizer hemly

5'10" or 5'11". (Was he wearing

No. (Neither. of

Neither of them.

Oswald was in

his shirt sleeves.

(But the other

guy had a tie and suit on?) That's right. Very dignified looking

guy.

(Was he older than Oswald?)

Well, it seemed like he was.

l imagine he was in his 405. 1 don't know.

A nice looking a guy. i

And he was well dressed.

He had a dark suit on.

says, but that's all in

the past..

(More specific on the date? Was it before Labor Day?) Might have

been before Labor Day. Because my wife was a school teacher and she

was preparing to s

back to school.

so it might have been around

the last of August

or the first of september when he came to my.

house.

I can recall that she was in the process of getting ready

to go back to school. Coid he say why he mentioned san Salvador?.

No, he

jast said his contacts had a big opportunity to take over

the country of san Salvador.

But you know, from the way he talked.

I think the only reason he come there to see me was to get those

four guns, because he emphasized that's what he

really did want.

He benged

me almost to net them guns. And he told me, he says, "Hell,!

you don't have any guts!' I savs, "well, l just don't want to get..

in any more of this kind of business....'

Did Oswald give you

any indication that he knew Ruby?

No, he didn't. "Where he was

from?)

No, but he said he lived in Texas, I can remember that he

Re: Contact with Jack Ruby:

Shortly after Castro took over

in Cuba, RM had just opened a

new

lounge, J 8M Drive-In, in Harris

County, Texas, when one

day a deputy sheriff came over and

said some guy in

Dallas

was trying to reach him by telephone,

said it was a case "of

life and death."

Asked if it was

all

right to give the caller

RM's phone number. Mithin about 30 minutes a call came from

Dallas from

a guy who said his name was Rubinstein.

jumbled, but later he ena corroborates

he had some jeeps and slot

machines he wanted. to:

to get in touch with Castro..

some jeeps

in Shrevesport, La.

"And

he said

he had access to a whole

of slot machises that were. in a

mountain in New Mexico, in a

cave over there..!

say that during his first telephone call; just said he had some

people over there and

he would

like to know if I could help him!

get them out of there. Then

he

said he would come down to see me:

and we'd go over the

details.

He did come down and

that's .wak when

he talked

sawd about the leeps

and

slot machines.

Ruby. did

mention

that he knew a few people in Cuba, members of the Mafia.

"That's what he called it,

the Mafia, but

he never did mention:

no names.

days

I asked where he stayed at over there.and

he said he stayed at the Nationcial Hotel.'

Ruby gave no indication

he x had been

in Cuba more than onee...

[long discussion

here

about date when Ruby visited him;

there was

a newspaper clip dated January 3, 1959

headlined: "Gunrunner Hails?

Castro Victory"

which may have been the impetus for the initiall

Ruby call.

Hubert Memo says it was April, 1959, probably a mistake.]

Ruby didn't mention when he called who the

five "friends of his""

were he wanted to get out of Cuba

who were

being "held"

there..:"

.. during conversation with him on visit talked about Maimi with

Ruby;

"He asked

me about the clover club, I think, at least mentioned

it.

He

asked me if I knew that place, used

to be over on Biscayne;

a big nighteluh. He said, well, you know it's got

a back room.

in

there, it's called the Ponce Room, that's where Latin's used to

hang out, do a
