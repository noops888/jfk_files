C. activities Destened to Covntor Castro Polistes

Since Castro's assumption of pover in Cuba,tths Montecri sti
group has folloved a policy of participating in the government for
the purpose of exercising a restraining influence on Castro. Even
before the fall of Batista, the group did not think that Castro and
hia radical ideas were the solution to Cuba's problems. But any
plane to sabotage Castro's program, the group felt, would serve no
‘weful purpose and would only make a bad situation varse. So it vas
decided instead to attempt to influence government policies and to
serve aa a brake on same of the more radical policies of the Castro
gcvernment, although Carrillo eriticized Castro's methods in
June 1959, he did not consider it feasible at that tine nor was the
group prepared upenly to oppose Castro,

The Montecrist’ group became alarned in iugust at the situation,
particularly with regard to Cuba's presént economic problema end the
growth of Commniam, By October the group abandoned hope 4t
could exercise a moderating influence on Castro and reportedly began
@ clandestine resistance movement, while its menbers in the government
carefully maintained an appearance of complete loyalty to Castro.

Resistance plans included the following:

1. Col. Barquin's acceptance of leadership of resistence
movement.

2, snti-Commmist propaganda campaign from outside Cuba.

3. Withdrawal of Montecristi members from government at
opportune time,

4. Ultinately, a coup or revolt by anti-Conmmist sectors
of arned forces.

C. Aasosment of Current Strength and Influence

Senches describes. the Triple A as a civic association to be
converted into a political party as soo as the ccastituticnal -
proviaion for this type of organization 4s put into effect. His
group ia small, well-organized, but has little mass folloving. It
does not represent a really inportant or significant political force.
Sone reports have indicated the possibility that he may return to the
dutentico Party. Sanches, hovever, clains he kas plans to increase
the scope and strength of the Triple A by incorporating other groups
into hie organisation.

According to Sanchez, the Triple A currently 4s expanding through-
out the country and is getting recruits fron the old autenticos, from
pvople who first started political life in the 26 of July, sone few
from the Ortodcxos, and aleo from the ranks of those who are completely
new to political activity. His group hss act attracted the suppart of
former follovers. of B:tista who Jalned the 2 of July in considerable
numbers. These he describes as people who had no positions of public
respacibility under Batista, but because they essentially favored a
strong-men government, they supported Batista and now support Castro
for the sane reasoa.

According to Elier Roiidrigues Amaro, aseistant Publicity Director,
and Sr, Gonzales, Secretary of Acts, the Triple A has been extending
its activities throughout the ieland end has established local groups
in towns and cities in most of the provinces, It has also established
4 labor commission and claims some inflience in the labor movement,
particularly in the construction end gastronanie trade unin federations.
Sanchez emphasizes, hovever, that as long as the Castro government renains
tn pover, no political group which 1e nct with the government can vin a
najarity in the lebor mor exent.

Although the Triple a has little mass following, 1% possesses a
cadre ‘of intellectuals and has the capability of providing a sual)
opposition. The group has made efforts to organize and extend its
activities, has ;ubliched a few pamphlets to date, and has requested
US assistance in developing its opposition capahility.
