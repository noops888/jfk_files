_ For fourteen days between 3 and 21 May 1965, the same CIA
psychologist interviewed NOSENKO on his entire early history,
from birth until about :953, when he said he entered the KG5.
The main purposes were to collect additional information on this

personality, and to find possible ways of obtaining a truthful
account. Although conducted under the. physical conditions of
interrogation, the questioning was relaxed and fo! lowed no rigid

detail some incidents which he has subsequently admitted to be
untrue. An extract from the psychologist's report of these
interrogations is given below.

Report _by Psychiatrist

During the year April 1964-April 1965 NOSENKO was under the
medical care of a CIA psychiatrist who visited NOSHIXO at regular
intervals, usually weekly, to examine him vhysically and to listen
to any comments NOSENKO might have about himself and his situation.
The psychiatrist femiliarized himself with available materials on
NOSENKO, particularly with reports of his behavior in the months ©
immediately following the defection. A report which he submitted

on 20 December 1964 is given below.

B. Views of Intelligence Personnel

1, Statement by DERYARIN

a. Introduction

Former KGB officer Peter Sergeyevich DERYABIN has followed
closely the entire course of CIA's investigation of NOSENKO and
his information. He took pert in the interrogaticns of NOSENKO
in April 1964, January-February 1965, and Cctoker 1966 as an Ob-
server and consultant, and he personally questioned NOSENKO during
July and August 1965 concerning certain aspects of his personal
past and early KGS career. On the basis of his direct, personal
knodledge of conditions within tt Soviet Union and of KGB organi-
zation and procedures prior to his defection in February 1954,

Supplemented by continuing study of later information from a
variety of sources, DERYABIN is of the opinion that much of what
HOSENKO has said akout himself and the KGB is purposefully false
or distorted. Although DEXYABIN has been able to offer authorita-
tive comment on many aspects of NOSENKO's story, the following
isection of this paper is limited to his remarks concerning NOSEN-
KO's entry into the KGB (then MVD) and his Communist Party affili-
ation, both of which fall into the period when RYABIN was active
as a KGB (then MVD) staff officer, DERYABIN personally interro-
gated NOSENKO on these topics in the summer of 1965. Since DER-
YABIN was a personnel officer of the KGB (then 4GB and MVD) in
Moscow, #ith long experience in Communist Party activities, at
the time NOSENKO claims to have entered the American Department
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, he is particularly qualified
to comment on these aspects of NOSENKO's story.

DERYABIN, as a Soviet Army officer, #as graduated in 1945
from the higher counterintelligence school of Smersh (counter-
intelligence with the Soviet Armed Forces). Following this he
worked in Naval.Smersh in Moscow and in March 1947 began to work
dn the MGB as a case officer in the Central Personnel Directorate.
Shortly afterwards, when his superior was appointed Deputy Chief
of the Chief Guards Directorate for Personnel, DERYABIN trans-
ferred with him to the Guards Directorate. He served as & Guards
Directorate personnel officer until May 1952, rising through the
ranks from case officer to the position cf Chief of Section. One
of his responsibilities was the approval of personnel for service
in various units of the Guards Directorate, and he was also in
charge of supervising personnel and security matters concerning
one of the Directorate’s surveillance sub-sections.

After requesting a change from personnel to operational
duties, DERYABIN was transferred in May 1952 to the Austro-German
Department’ of the MGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate. Until
December 1952 he served as the Deputy Chief of a sub-section in
the Counterintelligence Sektcor (desk) of the Austro-German Depart-
ment. He was then appointed Deputy Chief of the intelligence
Sektor of. the same department, a position he held until March
1953. From March until September 1953, DERYABIN was the Deputy
Chief of the section in MGB Headquarters which was responsible
for the security of Soviets stationed in Austria and Germany.

In September 1953 he was transferred to Vienna, «here he became
Deputy Chief of the section in the MVD Legal Residency respons-
ible for the security of Soviets in Austria. He defected to
American authorities on 15 February 1954.

DERYASIN joined the Komsomol in 1°36 wad remained a member
until 1940, when he became a candidate member of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union; he beceme a full Party memoer in
hugust 1941. During his Party career he held a number of responsi-
ble posts. Before the war, when DERYABIN was a teacner in Altay
Kray, he #as the secretary of a local Komsomol unit and simultan-
eously served us a member of the Komsomol Plenum in the reyon
where he lived. From Octoter 1940 uncil November 1941 he was
Secretary of the Komsomol Committee of the 107th Engineer Batt8lion
of the Red Army and from June 1945 until April 1946 held the same
position in the Komsomol Committee of the Naval Smersh. This was
the unit which had particular responsibility for counterintelli-
gence work within the Naval GRU, which NOSENKO said he joined in
1951, ‘In the MG3 DERYABIN was a member of the Party Committee of
the Personnel Section of the Guards Directorate and, after his
transfer, was eiected Secretary of the Party 8ureau of the Austro-
German Department of the Foreign Intelligence Directorate. He held
this post from January 1953 until his transfer to Austria in Sep-
tember 1953. #

b. DERYABIN's Comments

The following statements by DERYABIN are based on his question-
ing of NOSENKO between 26 July and 13 August 1965, The questions
asked and the statements attributed to NOSENKO (referred to as
Subject) were during this period. Although the Soviet State Secu-
rity Service did not become known as the KGB until March 1954,
this term is used for convenience sake, except where the specific
organization of the MSB or MVD is under discussion, DERYABIN's
comments follow:

“"NOSENKO's Acceptance into State Security*

"Taking NOSENKO's. own statements at face value, it is highly
improbable that a person such as he has described himself to be
would be acceptable for a position as a staff officer in State
Security. The following factors are important in this regard: o

a. It was the policy of State Security to avoid hiring
the children cf high government officials.

b. Until STALIN's death in March 1953, KOBULOV, the
nan who supposedly helped NOSENKO gain éntrance into the
service, had no influence inside the MGS apparatus. From
about 1948 until 9 or 10 March 1953, KOBULOV had no office
inside the MGB or the ‘VD buildings... I know personally that
in these years KOBULOV worked in Germany as Deputy Chief of
the GUSIMZ (Chief Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad) **
which was once directly under the Council of Ministers and
later under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The office was
located.on Chkaiova Street, near the Kurskiy Railroad
Station (three blocks from my. former apartment) .

¥” See also Part V.B.

#* WISMUT A.G. in Germany was subordinate to GUSIMZ; for a
further discussion of KOBULOV's role in helping NOSENKO

c. It was physically impossible at the time for NCSENKO.

‘ to be recomended for and accepted into State Security, as he
has told us, all in one month, March 1953, (If one accepts
his earlier version that he had his talk with KOBULOV in Jan-
uary or February, his account is similarly impossible because
KOBULOV was not then in State Gecurity.) It weuld normally
have taken a much longer time, but in addition to this it was
a pericd of reorganization and the personnel staff was not
actively conducting their work at that time, and pemaanent
staff officers were rot sure that they would retain their
positions,

@. In March 1953. NOSENKO was already twenty-five and a
half years old and orly a member of the Komsomol. He had no
recommendation for Party membership and could not become a
menber for a full year because of his transfer from one ser-
vice (GRU) to another. It is impossible that State Security
would accept him knowing in advance that on his birthday he
would be twenty-six years old and without either Komsomol or
Party membership. ven for the son of a Minister, the Secre- ‘
tary of the Komsomol Committee of the KGS would have to talk
with the Personnel Cffice and would not give a recommendation
for his acceptance, especially for the Internal Counterintel-
ligence (Second Thief) Directorate. In the case of a son of
a@ Minister and one #ho is recommended by KOBULOV, the secre-
tary would request from NOSENKO a recommendation for Party
membership from the members of the Communist Party where
NOSENKO used to work, in this case the GRU. In this way the
secretary of the Komsomol would be sure himself that NOSENKO
Would become a candidate member of the Communist Party suring
the next year. ‘

“However, even accepting that despite these obstacles and
“contradictions the KGB would have accepted him, one must also
remember (according to HOSENKO's own statemenis) that NOSENKO's
file contained the foliowing negative points.* They are serious
factors and certain of them alone would be enough to cause the
rejection; the totality makes it difficult to believe that at a
time of crisis in the State Security organs anyone would take the
resporsibility of accepting him:

a. Subject was already married and divorced before entry
into State Security.

b. He had been married to General TELEGIN's daughter i
and TELIGIN had been arrested by State Security and was in
jail the day that Subject entered State Security. ‘

©. NOSENKO said that there was a file on NOSENKO's
father in which compromising material was collected on_ -
-.. Subject's family. NOSENKO agreed that one piece of infor-
Lo _ tation that would-have been in this file was the fact that
his maternal grandfather died in a Soviet prison while under
sentence as a counter-revolutionary. =

H da. The social status background in the life of Subject's
mother was nobility.

* "See also Part IV.B. !


© op secRtl ¢

e. The shooting incident in Leningrad during World
War II and his desertion froin the Naval School in Baku
would have played a very negative role in any consideration
of his acceptance into State Security.

f£, Subject never completed high echool in the normal
fashion.

g- Subject was a poor student at the Institute of Inter-
national Relations.

h. It should be added that the KGB would definitely
kno# that NOSENKO was involved in an automobile accident
in 1947 and was interrogated by the Militia (traffic court),
found guilty, and fined. This would definitely play a
negative role in NOSENKO's admission to the KGB,

i. NOSENKO would never ke allowed to enter the KGB having

just recovered from tuberculosis.* In fact, there was a rule
at that time that no person who ever had tuberculosis (even
twenty years earlier) would ke permitted to work in the KGB.

“In addition, after acceptance, the fact that KOBULOV was a
personai friend of Subject's father, as he has told us, would
have been noted in the file and would have played a negative role
in permitting Subject to continue to work in State Security after
KOBULOV's arrest in June 1953. i:

“I asked Subject how he answered some of the questions in the
anketa (entry questionnaire), particularly the questions on his
former wife, her relatives, and on his mother's ancestry.** I
then asked Subject how it was, taking into account his mother's
aristocratic ancestry, the fact that her father died in jail, the
Trotskyite allegations against Subject's father, the fact that
Subject's former father-in-law (TELZGIN) was still in jail, and
the fact that Subject was present when TELEGIN‘s epartment was
searched--that he had been accepted into the KGS, particularly

in 1953 during the confusion and changes after the death of STALIN,

Subject admitted that the question was logical, and said that he
could only assume that the influence of KOBULOV and the important
and influential position of his own father outweighed these nega-

tive factors. He also cited his GRU experience in this connection.

"I then asked Subject how he had reported his second marriage
tc the KGB. He replied that before the marriage he had mentioned

® NOSENKO first mentioned having had tuberculosis during the June
1962 meetings, when he described it as a minor case but said he
was under out-patient treatment until 1958. He next mentioned

~ his iYIness in 1966, describing how he sometimes coughed up a

- "glass of blood"- at~a-time. Although DERYABIN’s questioning ~ ~
covered this part of NOSEIKO's life in detail, there was no
mention of tuberculosis in July and August 1965. DERYABIN's
comment is based on the 1966 information but is included here
for purposes of context.

**The anketa and DERYABIN's questioning on this subject are dis-
cussed further below.

it briefly to GORBATENKO, and that he had unofficially run a name 7
check on his prospective pride (which was ‘clean'), and that after

the marriage he had filled out another arketa in which he included * f
all the required data on his wife and her relatives. After con- iH
siderable prompting, Subject gard that he had indicated thet she E
and her parents had een in France, but that he had concealed the aH
fact that her grandmother had been in German-occupied territory |
during the war. (He admitted that the KGB would have learned this
in a routine check, however.) I then reviewed for Subject the
negative security factors mentioned ebove, adding the arrest of
KOBULOV, the fact that his new wife and her parents had been
abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-occupied
territory, the fact that Subject was now over-age for the Komsomol i
put not yet a Party member or candidate, and the fact that Subject ‘
received a 13-day sentence for misuse of cover documents and in-
curring venereal disease, and asked if he didn't think that his
personnel file had been reviewed in 1954, and if so, what grounds
there could have Leen for retaining him in the KGB, Subject said !
that he thought that his file probably was reviewed but that

again the influence of his father had saved him, Subject added

that another important factor was procably his language qualifi-

cation and particularly his higher education. I pointed out to

Subject that if his second wife and her parents had been abroad

it was impossible that her name check could have been negative.

He admitted it was illogical, but insisted that this was so.

“NOSENKO's Knowledge of KGB, 1953-54

"Entry Date into KGB: NOSENKO was reminded that he had pre-
viously siven varying @ates for his entry on duty in the KGB. He
replied that he did not remember the exact date, but he was sure
that it was in the middle of March 1953 - perhaps 13 or 15 March - bate
(15 March 1953 was a Sunday). He would give no explanation for _ i
why he previously claimed to have entered the KGB in Hee i
1952.* In fact it would be very unusual for @ KGB officer to
forget his exact entry-on-duty date to the very day because it
is used to compute length of service and must be entered on vari-
ous forms from time to time. : «

Numerical Lesignation of the Intelligence. and Counterintelli-
gence Directorates in 1953: Asked to describe what directorates
existed in the MVD while BERIYA was Minister (March-June 1953),
NOSENKO named the First Chief Directorate (FCD) and the Second
Chief Directorate (SCD) which he said were the untelligence and
counterintelligence directorates respectively. Asked if he were
sure, NOSENKO said he was positive, and that the only change that
took place was that later, under KRUGLOV, for. @ few months only,
the FCD became the SCD, and vice versa. NOSENKO stuck to this
even when told he. was wrong; he did not say he did not know or
dia not remember, perhaps realizing that he could not claim not
to remember shat directorate he served in. (Actually, the change
in numerical designations was instituted by BERIYA right after
STALIN's death in March 1953 and persisted until the KGB was - -
organized in March 1954. Thus, NOSENKO does not know what the
correct designation of his own directorate was at the time that
jhe allegedly entered on duty with Soviet State Security and for
the entire first year of his alleged service there.

i: @WOSENKO on other occasions thas given various reasons why he

told CIA that he joined the KCB in 1952. See Part V.B.

“MVD Leadershi- 1953-54: Asked to nane the chiefs cf the
directorates and separate departments of the MVD under BERIYA
and KRUGLOV, NOSFNKO named nine out of 78. He was unable to name
the Chief of the Intellicence Directorate, saying that he remem-
bered only SAKHAROVSKIY (PANYUSHKIN was chief untis 1955).
to name KRUGLOV's deputies, NOSENKO named only RO:ASHKOV a:
SEROV, and was ignorant of such prominent deputies 2s LUNEV
SHATALIN. Told that a Secretary of the Central Committee of
CPSU was one of KRUGLOV's deputies at this time (SHATALIN), XO.
ENKO flatly denied that this was possible.

“Organization of KGB: NOSENKO did not know when the KGS was
organized (March 1954). He said that it was in early 1955 or
late 1954. Told that he was a year off and asked to think it
over, NOSENKO insisted that he was right.

"Processing Procedures for Employment with KG: NOSENKO's
story about how he was processed for employment with the XGB in
1953 is inconsistent with the procedures used at that time. He
does not know many of the things that he should know about en-
trance procedures; he is wrong about many of the things that he
cleims to remember. The disparities are so creat that they can-
not be explained (as NOSENKO attempts to do) by the claim that
KOBULOV's recommendation resulted in a simplified entrance pro-
cedure for HOSENKO,

“The most important document filled out by prospective em-
ployees of Soviet State Security is a detailed personal history
questionnaire, called in Russian Anketa spetsialnoco naznachentya
sotrudnika KGB, This exhaustive questionnaire is 16 pages long,
and filling it out is an experience that one is not likely to
forget. A background investigation is run on the basis of this
questionnaire, which itself becomes a permanent and prominent
feature of the employee's personnel file. NOSENKO remembers
filling out a questionnaire, but does not know its designation.
He asserts that it was only 4-6 pages long. He asserts that he
filled it out at home, and submitted it in two copies shortly
before entering on duty. Actually, this questionnaire was re-
quired in one copy only, and was never permitted to be taken
home since it was a classified document (even when not filled
in).*

“NOSENKO insists that he did not have to take a medical exam-
ination prior to entering the KGB. This is not possible. Such
an examination was a routine and mandatory part of the processing.
I cannot think of any instance in which it would be waived.**

® DERYABIN's views are based on NOSENKO's statements in August
1965. In his original biographical statement (1962), NOSENKO
said that no anketa was required, He implied as much in his
most recent statement in April 1966, after being questioned
by DERYABIN, - This- statement is given in Part V.B. oe

**See remarks above concerning NOSENKO's alleged treatment for
tuberculcsis from 1952 to 1958. : 7 :

“NOSENKO's description of the secrecy agreement that he
signed when entering on duty with the KGB is completely unlike
the agreement that was in use at that time for staff employees.
It may be significant that NOSENKO's description of the secrecy
agreement he recalls signing resembles the secrecy agreements
that were taken from agents.

“NOSENKO insists that he did not fill cut any other forms,
questionnaires, or papers when entering the KG Actually, there
were a number of other routine forms that had to be £41led out by
applicants and new employees.

“Location of ROZHZNKO's Office: NOSENKO says that all his
entry processing was handled by a personnel officer named ROZHEN-
KO and his staff. He asserts that ROZHENKO's office, which NOS-
ENKO visited several times in early 1953, was located on the 6th
floor, 8th entry, Building No. 12, Dzerzhinskiy Street, In fact,
neither ROZIENKO nor any officers or units of the Personnel De-
partment were located in the 8th entry. They were all (including
ROZHENKO) located on the 6th and 7th floors of the 7th entry of
Building No. 12.*

"Rank Pay: Asked about his salary when he first started to
work in the KGB, NCSENKO said ke got a basic salary of 1700 rubles
as a case officer, 500 rubles for his rank of lieutenent, plus
secrecy, languace, and longevity pay. He insisted that this was
correct, even «nen told that KGE officers were no longer being
paid for rank in March 1953, and said that although he remembered
that there was one year--1954--when they were not paid for rank,
jhe was sure that when he first entered on duty he received this
pay. Salary for rank was taken away from State Security officers
in September 1952 and was not restored until April 1954, u

"Promotion to Senior Lieutenant: In giving the chronology
of his promotion to various military ranks, NOSENKO claimed to
have been promoted to senior lieutenant in April 1953, shortly
after joining the KGB, Told that this was impossible, and that
no one in the KGB was promoted at this time, NOSENKO replied that
jhe couldn't say about anyone else but he was sure that he had re-
ceived his promotion at that time. In fact, this is impossible:
fall promotions in the XGB were frozen from the time BERIYA took
over as minister (March 1953) until late 1953.

“visitor's Pass Procedure In talking about his first visit
to the KSB to process for employment, NOSENKO was unable to re-
call the procedures employed by the KGB Pass Office in issuing
visitor's passes. Specifically, he maintained that the name of
the interviewer was not indicated on the pass. In fact,. the
name of the interviewer did appear on the pess and the inter-
viewer had full responsibility for the visitor while he was on
KGB premises. While it is understandable that NOSENKO might
have forgotten the details involved if he had only visited there
a few times more than ten years ago, if he worked at KGB-Kead- ~
“quarters for over ten-years-as a Staff officer_and. particularly.
as a supervisor he would have frequent occasion to admit visitors,
and thus should know visitor's pass procedures quite well.

ef dssedlsssiasanetasastsssneem eset
NOSENKO has since Said that he spoke to no personnel officers
prior to acceptance by the KGB cr afterwards, thereby indicatiag
that his statements to DERYABIN were untrue. See Part V.B.

“Unescorted Entry into KGB Building with Visitor's Pass: In
describing his first day at work, NOSENKO said tnat he went from
the Pass Office, where he obtained a visitor's pass, to the 4th
entry of the Bsilding No. z, where his pass was checked by the
guards, and then went unescorted to KCBULOV's office on the third
floor. Challenged on this point, he said he was sure that it was
possible to enter without an escort. In fact, it was absolutely
impossible to go through any entry of Building No. 2 without
escort if you did not have a properly stamped KGS (MVD) identity
document (see below).

“KGB Identity Document: NOSENKO was asked to describe the
KGB Identity document that he received when he first entered the
KGB, He was then asked if there vas anything unusual in connec-
tion with this document at that time. He replied thet he knew of
nothing unusual, He was then reminded that @ r STALIN's death
and again after EERIYA's arrest it was necess to have special
stamps placed in the identity docrments to vaiidate them. With-
out the right stamp it was impossikie to ente: the KGB Duilding.
NOSENKO was ignorant of this and was unable to recal! anything
about it despite a number of hints and leading questions, Actu-
ally, during the period of upheaval following STALIN's death and
again after 3ERIYA's arrest, all KGB identity documents were tem-
porarily withdrawn in order te have special validation stamps
placed in them, and it was literally impossible to get in the
KGB buildings if one did not have the right stamp. This was the
subject of numerous anecdotes at the time and is hard to believe
that an officer who served in the KG at the time could have for~
gotten it completely.

"“Gastronom: Asked to describe the sign in front of the KGB
Club, NOSE: said that he did not remember any sign (there was
one in 1953) but mentioned that there was a Gastronom (food store)
next to the KGB Club. Asked when the Gastroncm was cpened, he
said. firmly that it was already there when he started to work
in the KGS, In fact, this Gastronom was definitely not there as
of 1954, It was opened sometime Letween 1955 .and 1957, as Moscow
directories show. The KGB Club is in entry No. 1 of Building
Ro. 12, Dzerzhinskiy Square, and OSENKO would have had to pass
it every day he went to work.

“Chief Directorate of Militia: Asked where the Chief Direc
torate of Militia of the USSR was located in 1953-54, NOSENKO

replied that he did not know, and knew only that later it was
located on Ulitsa Ogareva, Actually, in 1953-54 it was located
next to the main KGB building at Dzerzhinskiy No. 2. A staff
officer in the counterintelligence directorate would have fre-
quent occasion to deal with the Chief Directorate of Militia.

*K.I. (Committee of Information): Asked where the Intelli-
gence Directorate of the MVD was located in 1953, NCSENKO replied
that it was scattered between Dzerzhinskiy No. 2, the Acricultural
Exhibition, the K.I. building, and Kiselniy Pereulok. This is
a confused and incorrect answer. “Asked for clarification, NCS=
ENKO said that he had never visited either the K.I. or the First
Chief Directorate building at the Agricultural Exhibition. Thus, ©
HOSENKO seems to be unaware that the K.I. has not existed since
1951, and that the K.I. building and the building at the Agri-
cultural Exhibition were one and the same place.

“NOSENKO's Claim to Have Been a Komsomol’ Secretary in the
Second Chief Directorate, K

“NOSENKO claimed to have become a member of the Komsomol
Organization (K/O) of the KGB when he entered on duty in March
1953, to have been elected as Secretary of Komsomol Organization
of the Second Chief Directorate in the fall of 1953, and to have
served in that capacity until the fall of 1954, when he was re-
moved because he used operational—alias documents in obtaining
treatment for a venereal disease he had incurred. He claims to
have been excluded from the Komsonol, without prejudice, when he
attained his 27th birthday in October 1954.

“Asked to describe how he transferred from the Keinsomol Crgan-
ization of the Naval Intelligence Post in the Baltic to the Kom-
somnol Organization of the KGB, NOSENKO gave an entirely incorrect
description of this procedure, both as reyards deregistration from
the K/O in the Baltic, and registration with the K/O in the KGB,
He stated that he was issued a new Komsomol registration card by
the KGB K/O, without reference to the previous K/O in the Baltics
this is impossible.

"NOSENKO gave an incorrect account of how a K/O secretary is
elected, stating that he was elected at a meeting of the K/O. In
fact, the K/O meeting can only select the K/O committee, which will
convene separately to elect the Secretary.

“NOSENKO could not describe the duties of a K/O secretary in a
specific manrer.

"NOSENKO did not know who was the secretary of the overall KGB
K/O. The secretary of the SCD K/O would be directly subordinate
to him and would deal with him frequently.

"NOSENKO was unable to describe his dealings with the KGB K/O
or the identities or responsibilities of the people with whom he
dealt there.

“NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-54, the maximum age for a Kom-
somol member was 27. In actual fact, the maximum age was 26 (it
was raised later). This point is important, both because NOSENKO
should know exactly if he had served as a K/O secretary, and also
because it refutes his story that he was excluded from the Kom-
somol for over-age in 1954.

“"NOSENKC maintained that all the members of his K/O paid dues
in the amount of 2 percent of their monthly salaries. This is
incorrect, as monthly Komsomol dues were calculated on a sliding
scale determined by wage group: at that time, Komsomol members
earning up to 500 rubles monthly paid 0.5 percent; those earning
500 to 1500 rubles paid 1 percent, and those earning over 1500
rubles paid 1.5 percent. The K/O secretary collects the dues, i

and must know the right™ amount. ~ ~~~ ~ eat as asetc ce enturanenTeuentaeuanecentcend

“NOSENKO did not know whether or not a Komsomol Congress
took place while ne was K/O secretary, saying that they took ©
place every year. In actual fact, the 12th Komsomol Congress
which convened in March 1954 was the first since 19487 at this
12th Congress a number of changes were made in the Komsomol Rules
(Ustay). As secretary of a K/O NOSENKO would have been involved

in a good deal of preparatory work for this Congress, which was

could not be forgotten.” .

Although DERYABIN's direct knowledge of the KGB ended in 54,

at.
NUSENKO has said about KGS procedures, DERYABIN
stated: “Asked to describe how he conducted name checks on a
Seviet citizen and on a new arrival to the American Embassy in
1953-54, NOSENKO gave a superficial descripticn of how such
checks were done, However, he resisted every attempt to get him
to describe this process in detail, and he mace several blunders
which show that he never actually ran such a check himself. For
example, he did not know where the records of all Soviet citizens
who have been tried are kept, and he attempted to improvise an
answer (completely wrong) that they would check with the Militia
about this. NOSENKO correctly said that Archives were located
on Kirov Street, but he was completely unabie to stretch his
limited knowledge to provide a description of now these various
repositories were actually checked. NOSENKO was also asked to
describe in detail how he ran such a check on a Soviet citizen
in the 1956-59 period. Here again he was in difficulty and re-
fused even to try. He did not even know the everyday term Spets-
proverka, which means a check for clearance.

“It was particularly interesting that he did not feel able to
dispute my challenges of his information, even though he undoubt-
edly knows that I do not have first-hand knowledge of procedures
in this period. I even tested this on one occasion by asking
NOSENKO the difference between the lst Spets Otdel (Special
Department - KGB cards and files) and the rat o-Uchetni:
Otdel (Operational Reports Department - the functional name for
the lst Special Department). He answered that the lst Special
Department holds the files on Soviet criminal cases wnile the
Operational Reports Department is for political and ¢spionage
cases. It seems he invented this answer on the spot. In addi-
tion, it is wrong that political and security cards are separate
from criminal cnes in the lst Special Department, They’ were
in my time and must still be combined in one card file.

“NOSENKO states that he’ knows nothing about the files of
the First Chief Directorate, It is unkelievable that in ten
years of service in the Second Chief Directorate NOSENKO never
saw a First Chief Directorate file; how else would he be able
to check information on foreigners, especially on American Em-
bassy personnel? The first stage in such a check is an inquiry
to the First Chief Directorate and a check of aay files they
may have on the subject, According to his own account, NOSENKO
should have keen doing this type of thing the whole of his ten
years of service, without regard to whether he was assigned to
the American Department or the Tpurist Department."

NOSENKO was talked to and questioned in several types of
circumstances:

- In five tightly orgenized meetings in 1962 in
Geneva with limited time available for each of a wide
range of topics, none of which could be ignored but none
of which could be covered in detail.

= In cgncentrated. but somewhat longer meetings in
place in Geneva in January-February 1964, with the know-
ledge by all participants that items not adequately covered
then could be dealt with after the defection.

tions under varied degrees of stress and control.

sistently observed by all of the officers involved.

b. NOSENKO's Conduct in Meetings

NOSENKO in brief, superficial, uncritical debriefings (of
the sort which characterized the 1962 and 1964 Geneva meetings
and the debriefings prior to 4 April 1964) was reasonabiy con-
vincing in his manner. For example, on the basis of the hur-
ried sessions of June 1962 in Geneva, which did not allow tine
for systematic or detailed questioning, the CIA case officer
in commenting on NOSENKO's conduct mentioned "the ease of his
manner, the sureness of his knowledge of matters which he should
have known, and the amount of checkable information he provided.*
NOSENKO seemed to that case officer to be “under little or no
restraint as to the amount and nature of what he told us" and
“made a convincing and good personal impression: 4 vigerow
temperamental and vital man." Similarly, nothing in NOSENKO's
manner caused doubts on the part of the Fal representatives who
took NOSENKO's reports in February, March, and early April 1964.

It became apparent, how:ver, when the cases KOSENKO had
mentioned briefly in early meetings were taken up if detail in
leisurely debriefings after the defection, that he could not add
facts consistent with what he had said before. He vas unable to
recall related incidents or additional circumstances which did
not come to mind in the first telling, despite being aided by
Guestioning from different angles or in different coatexts. The
same results were obtained in exhausting his store of operational
leads (with a half dozen exceptions) and his information on XGB
procedures, installations, and operational methods: Having once
reported on these general topics, NOSENXO could offer nothing
more when debriefed again, regardless of the method of question=-
ing tried. Repeatedly he used the same stories to 2llustrate
his points; new stories did not emerge. In a peric? of nine
months, NOSENKO was érained of information "6n nis pasta. and

professional experiences and knowledge, Never before had the
2 iger: countered a defector who was totally de=
briefed. -

A technique NOSENKO has frequently used to explain his in-
ability to supply details and to forestall further questicning

Bhas been to claim poor memory. “Different people have different

t 's of memories,” he has said on many OCcasions; Of on Others:
wt have told what I remember." The case officers who have
handled NOSENKO agree, on the other hand, that he has an excel-
lent memory, although perhaps a peculiar one: NOSENKO did not
Always recall most easily those events which had occurred nost
recently, or those incidents which were most closely related to
him. He was able, for example, to remember detailed information
on the penetration of the Courier Transfer Station in Paris and
to give a long, detailed, and ordered account of the compremise
of PENKOVSKIY, in neither of which he claimed any personal role;
he has been able to name hundreds of KGB officers, to give the
dates on which many of them transferred from one component of
the Second Chief Directorate to another, and to describe their
responsibilities at particular times. Yet NOSENKO forgot where
he himself served in the GRU; he could not consistently dis-
cribe the circumstances of his divorce; he failed to provide a
consistent date for his entry into the KGB and fcr his transfer
from the American Department to the Tourist Department in 1962.
Likewise, NOSENKO remembered details of KGB operations which,
like the "ANDREY" case in 1953, took place in the relatively dis-
tant past, but he could not recall the travels, friends, and
activities of his own target, John V. ABIb.AN or details of opera-
tions against many American code clerks in 1960 and 1961.

These limitations of krowledge ard quirks of memory were
evident not only curing meetings when NOSENKO wes being de>riefed.
They were also apparent in the interrogations which supplanted
the debriefings.

c. NOSENKO's Behavior Under Interrogation

(4) Introduction

In the many and long interrogation sessions there emerged
habits of behavior noticeable w> each of the C1A officers present.
These characteristics of NOSENKO were his manner of recounting
events end his evasiveness, improvisétions, ard other defensive
techniques. They are reviewed below.

(14) Manner of Recounting Events :
Typical of NOSENKO's performance in the interrogations were
the following points.

- Talking about operations he supervised and about his pe:
sonal role in the KG8 Headquarters aspects of other operations,
NOSENKO habitually used the passive voice ("it was decided") or
indicated that he was not alone in these activities (‘there was
no accounting on who was working on any code clerk case--it wes
GRYAZNOV, KOSCLAPOY, NCSENKO, and also working was KLYPIN, GRIBAN-
OV," or “We made the decision--I and KOVSHUK and GRYAZNOV," or “I
and GRYAZNOV discussed this with him.‘) #hen asked where a par-
ticular conversation took place, he rarely located it in his own
office ("I was in KOVSEUK's office when KCSLOV cailed him about

ip" or “I was in KLYPIN's office and he was talking to

- At the other extreme from being impersonal, NOSENKO some-
times quoted conversations in which he took part (“I then said,"
“he said to me," etc.), but it was in just such matters that
NOSENKO most often contradicted himself (e.g.. his relationship
with GRIBANOV and his part in the recruitment approach to the
American code clerk James STORSBERG).

~ In repeating certain ‘stories (the CHEREPANOV case and the
provocation against Professor Frederick BARGHOCFN are examples)
NOSENKO gave them in precisely the same order, without addition
or’ omission. -In relating the FENXOVSKIY story, which he stressed
he iearned “little by little’ from several different sources, he

_ presented the facts each time in nearly identical order. Asked

for more details on these cases, he invariably insisted--often
with irritation--that he knew nothing more and if ke did, he
would have reported it. Other factors contributed to the im-
pression that in such instances NOSENKO had delivered his infor-
mation by rote: Statements lixe “I don't remember what I told
you before" when queried again on a particular case: detachment
and a lack of emotion when describing the compromise of Soviets
who, like himself, had cooperated with Anerican Intelligence:
POPOV, PENKOVSKIY, and CHEREPANCV: an inability to correlate
dates ard events in different operations which he said he was
handling (such as conflicts in the timing of his approach to
W.E, JOPNSON and in the date he gave for John V. ABIDIAN's visit
to the Pushkin Street dead drop, and conflict between the dates
of his participation in the MCRONE case and his travel to Cuba).



~

~ TOP SECRET

628.

: ~ NOSENKO, with a few excepticns (notably the compromise of
PENKOVSKIY and the ASTDIAN visit: to the dead drop site), could
not supply specific or approximate dates for operational activi-
ties during the period of his service in the U.S. Dmbassy Section.
Beyond recourse to the phrase "1960, 1961," he refused to estimate
the dates or to associate these activities with the time of the
year or events in his personal life.

(141i) Byasion, Improvisation, and Other Defenses

In the debriefings before the interrogations, NOSENKO avoided
questicns and topics not of hig own choosing, saying that he would
give full details “later,” when systematic debriefing began.

When the question or topic came up anew in a later debriefing,
ie would plead fatigue or boredom and propose: "This morning
we drink; tomorrow we work." Prior to 4 April 1964 he provided
only accounts of operations selected by himself; it was only
after 4 April 1964 that he could be, constrained to reply to de-
tailed questioning on other matters. :

From that point on, other evasive tactics became familiar
to his interrogators. He would try to change the subject or
to shift from the sp fic event to a generalized account of how
such things were done in principle. He would claim bad memory
on grounds that, for example, operations against U.S. Embassy
personnel were hopeless and u. eless anyway. lie would dismiss the
details or the entire operation as unimportant (for example, the
microphones in the U.S. Embassy). He would set out reasons for
his ignorance of things he admittedly should have known (his own
“poor performance,” pteoccupacion with other matters, inattention
to duty, absence from the KGB while on vacation, lack of time to
master details because he was a superviser). Unable to name or
talk about KGB indigenous agents working against Americans, in-
cluding those in operations under his supervision, NOSENKO
disparaged the quality of,such agents ("they never reported any~
thing of interest on anyone"); he cited their low educational
level and their inferior status as servants and employees as
one reason none of them could give the KGB operationally useful
dnformation. In fact, the record of many indicated previous em-
ployment which would demand at least the equivalent of a college
degree or certificate from a technical institute. Numerous maids
were former school teachers, one was formerly a chemist.

When evasion failed, it seemed to the interrogators that
NOSENXO improvised his answers. Some of these evident improvisa-
tions led him into unacceptabie statements or positions. To use
his responses to the questioning on John V. ABIDIAN as an example:
Not knowing about ABIDIAN's car, he said the KGB could not get
at it. (In fact, the car was held by. Soviet customs for two
weeks, and later NOSENKO himself spoke about the way the KGB used
Embassy chauffeurs for access to cars.) Not knowing of ABIDIAN'S
trips out of the USSR, he claimed that the KGB had no way to
find out where Embassy officers went when they made trips out of
the country. (In fact, ABIDIAN had told his language teacher
each time and she, as NOSENKO said, was a KGB agent; also, ABIDIAN
Grranged his trips by long-distance phone from Moscow to his des-
tination abroad, and the KGB can cover such calls.) Not knowing
of ABIDIAN's trip within the USSR, he spoke of a vacation which
he latter admitted to be false. Asked why he did not know personal

data on ABIDIAN from the State Department Bicgraphic Register, é +
he said “only the First Chief Directorate” uses it; when tae
interrogator pursued the point, NOSENKO said he remembered that
KOVSHUK did have a copy in his office, “but an old one, 1956,

which didn't list ABIDIAN." Under pressure about ABIDIAN's visit

to Pushkin Street, NOSENKO said the KGB thought that ABIDIAN may

not have entered the building on Pushkin Street; yet he had earl-

der given extensive details about how the KG3 had analyzed the ‘
precice number of seconds ABIDIAN had been inside, to'\determine

where the drop, if any, might be. As another example, when he

was initially asked about Geozge BLAKE, tl.2 KGB agent in MI-6,

the context of the question was a discussion of Second Chief
Directorate operations. NOSENKO labeled it as such and said it :
“was not ag important as VASSALL." Later, when the name was men- t
tioned again, he asked: “Who's BLAKE?" :

aepeeassospseapveaaat

On other occasions, when his self-contradictions were pointed
out or when he admitted ignorance of matters h2 acknowledge he
should have known, NOSENKO would fall back upon cne of the follow-
ing lines of defense:

- “What I know I tell you; what T remember I tell
you," or “I don't know," "I can't explain,” -~ oz a shrug.

- The details, even if confused or contradictory, are
not important. What is important is the “whole” or entirety
of the facts, their importance and their “reality.” It is
this that American Intelligence should evaluate, not de-
tails.

STORSBERG?" “The KGB would not use a staffer as a provo~
cateur,” nor would the KGB supply infermation on “live
cases" such as the Paris case (JOHNSON) and VASSALL, and
reveal the names of its officers abroad.

- I€ American Intelligence checked his story "fully,"
it would learn that despite all this confusion, he was genu- t
ine. He repeatedly urged that his interrogators check
via an independent penccration of the KGB--there it would
verify that his name is registered as the case officer who
opened, held and turned over the ABIDIAN file and thus that
he was a KGB officer.* ,

NOSENKO referred to this method of correborating him.at least
20 times during the interrogations of January-March 1965. He said
on 1 February 1965 that “maybe the day will come when you have
a source to check and you will find out” (that he was ABIDIAN's
case officer). Later in the same interrogation session, he added:. ae

that “time will show" that he is not a provocateur. At one point
he engaged in the following dialogue with his interrogators:

a. Additional observations

(1) Ingquisitiveness About CIA

NOSENKO's questions about CIA and its activities seemed to his
interrogators to be beyond the interest or curiosity expected of
Soviet Intelligence defectors. Frequently he asked, even while

@iscussing his own KGB responsibilities:
and I will remember details." Other examples of NOSE! O's inquisi

- NOSENKO asked precisely how American Intelligence col-
lection in the USSR is directed and coordinated. The CIA case
officer responded: “What was that question?” NOSENKO there-
upon said: “It was not a question--just general interest.” H
When the case officer urged him to repeat the question, he re- an
fused to talk about it and diverted the conversation to other
matters.

Under interrogation, even when accused of lying, NOSENKO
rarely challenged the validity of CIA's information nor claimed
superior knowledge. The only facts he challenged strongly were
incontestably true, such as the date of GOLITSYN's defection, the
date of ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin Street dead drop, KOSC-
LAPOV's travel separate from JENNER, and KOSOLAPOV'Ss November 1960
trip to Helsinki. It seemed at all times that he accepted that :
CIA knew more than he did on topics including conditions in the
USSR and cases and people for whom he claimed direct responsibility.
He never challenged DERIABIN's statements about KGB procedures,
although aware that his own information was more recent.

(e) Discussions with NOSENKO on His Own Performance
After admitting his inability to respond to questions about

i operations in which he said he participated, NOSENKO sometimes

gave a general appraisal of his own performance. He would admit
: that it was “impossible to have such memory breaks” and agree
i that his response was neither reasonable nor acceptable ("In your ;
place I wouldn't believe it either," or on another occasion, “It
if will look bad to your boss"). Admitting that the questions were
fair, logical, and clearly put, he acknowledged at least a dozen
t times during the January-March 1965 interrogation that his per- |
to. formance under questioning was bad and unacceptable.

ever, that there were about 20 to 25 "good" leads.

Cc Polyqreph Testing
1. Test _in April 1964

Shortly after his defection, NOSENKO agreed to undergo a
polygraph examination which tie CIA handlers had told him was a
routine part of his defector processing. He was informed on
3 April 1964 that the test would be adwinistered the following
morning, and that it was therefore advisable for him to get a
good night's rest and to refrain from alcorolic beverages. NOS-
ENKO drank heavily on the night of 3 Aprtl, did net enter his
bedroom until 0290 hours on 4 April, and following breakfast at
0739 hours on 4 April consumed several gin-and-tonics. Subse-
quently, when NOSENKO thought he was not beinc observed, he was
seen to remove his hand from his lips hurciedly.*.

Following a medical exemirnation by a physician «ho noted
that NOSENKO had been drinking, he was introduced to the CIA
polygraph operator. An experienced interroga+or, Zlvent in the
Passian language, this polyg:aph operator conc. ted the test in
Russian from 1045 to 1515 hours on 4 April. His report is quoted
below.

The question of Subject's (NOSENKO's) willingness to par-
ticipate in the polygraph test was one of minor consideration,
since he had, on previous occasions, acreed that he would take
the test. However, whether Subject wouid continve with the
polygraph testing if confronted with atcempted deception after
an initial test run, was one of the considered problems, Con-
sequently, in order to preclude the possibility of Subject's
terminating the test prior to its completion. 1t wes decided
that a minor deviation from the accepted polysrepn technique
would be used ducing the polygraph testing: specifically, to
insure that a polygraphic rece:¢ of Subject's reections to all
the pertinent questions be obtained prior to challenging him on
any significant polygrephic deception indications his charts
might reflect... This plen was followed throughout the poly-

* On 18 May 1964 a report was received on the chemical analysis
of six types of tablets which had been taken from NOSENKO's
personal effects. In this report, a CIA chemical expert made
the following remarks based on chemical, microscopic, and in-
strumental analysis including the use of X-ray: “Sample No.

"Although the Subject had used both alcohol and some unknown
drug prior to testing, there is nc guestioa, based both on analysis
of Subject's polygraph charts as well as persor21 observation dur-
ing the interview, that Subject has attempted deliberate deception
in the specific pertinent areas which are mentioned below in this

cific mission or missicns.

pertinent areas were covered with Subject polygraphically. Chal-
lenge of Subject's reacticns was indirect and ‘sort.’ On no occa-

possible causes for his polygrash reactions. He continually denied
and refused to admit that there was anyching to any of the questions
which were asked of him. When the final test questicns were com
pleted and a record was cbtained of all of Subject's polygraphic
responses, the nature of the challenge and prob:ng was changed.

“subject was told that he was lying to numerous pertinent ques-
tions and was accused of being a dispatched agent. Subject's only
explanation to [my] direct accusation was that He could not be a
dispatched agent because of the amount of information he had volun-
teered to American Intelligence.

"subject, who before and throughout testing reflected com~
plete self-control and composure, now exhibited a completely dif-
ferent picture. His composure was non-existent, his eyes watered,
and his hands tremtlea. Prior te being confrontec with [my] opinion

one of the last test runs (a) 1f he were sent to penetrate Ameri-

2. Test in October 2.965 on Lee Harvey OSWALD
a. Introduction

CIA conductes 3 volygraph exanination of NOSENKO on
18 October 1956 on 4c subject of Lee Harvey OSWALD. *

Since the previous polygraph test in April 1964, NOSENKO
had been under close security guard, his movenents restricted,
and in the interin had been interrogated in detail and accused
of bad faith in dealing with U.S. Government authorities.
NOSESKO had not been interviewed by CIA during the six months
prior to October 1966. He had had no access to alcohol or
drugs, his food consumption had been normal, and his sleep
had been adequate.

NOSENKO was given no advance notice of the polygraph
examination. Upon entering the room where it was to take
place, he immediately recognized the officer present as the
person who administered the first CIA polygraph test two and
one-half years earlier. NOSENKO correctly said that they had
first met on 4 April 1964.

In the pre-test interview, questions on the OSWALD case
were put to NOSENKO in Russian, his answers (also in Russian)
were recorded, the operation of the machine was explained,
and clarifications of the questions ard his answers were
made. The three series of questions pertaining to the OSWALD
case are given below in their entirety, and they are followed
by the conclusions of the polygraph expert.

VIIZ. NOSENKO'S BONA PIDES: ANALYSIS ‘AND. CONCLYSIONS

A Introduction

It is standard procedure to assess the bona fides of each
intelligence and counterintelligence source, and Special care is
required in assessing sources of information relevant to the secu-
rity of the United States.

|
|

A much more prominent factor in this assessment, however,
is NOSENKO's own testimony. CIA has exhaustively debriefed and
interrogated NOSENKO, his leads were checked, his information wa3
studied, and a large body of facts pertinent to his bona fides
was thus assembled. These details, as well as direct evidence
from other sources and the views of specialists affiliated with
CIA, have been presented in Part IIz. through Part VII. of this

paper.

Tre basic questions with recard to the bona fides of
NOSENKO are the following:

. Is there reason to question the general accuracy
and completeness of NOSENKO'S accounts of his situation
ana motivations in contacting CIA and later defecting,
his personal life, military service, positions in the
KGB, personal participation in KGB operations, know-
ledgeability about KGB activities and the way he learned
of them, and his associations with KGB personnel?

_ Ig there are grounds for doubting the general
accuracy and completeness of these accounts, then what
are the explanations for NOSENKO's actions, for the

ature of the information he has prov ided;—and for —

\ other Soviet sources having authenticated his personal
\ life and KGB career?

In assessing the bona fides of NOSENKO, the classic method
has been used: evaluating his production and sourcing, examining
his autobiography, and appraising him and the circumstances of
this operation, These points, wit" the conclusions drawn from
each, are reviewed below. Tne ¢iscussion continues with a survey
of the sources who have corroboratec NOSENKO's background and
status, and this is followed by argumentations on the various
hypotheses which could explain NOSENKO as a source. The final
portion is a summary of conclusions about NOSENKO's bona fides.


B. Evaluation of Production
ce 1. Introduction

There are several standards which may be applied to the assess-
ment of a source's production. Each of them is qualified: none is
likely to be conclusive by itself; and ali of them together may not
permit a definite conclusion, although they do contribute to a
broader assessment cf bona fides. The standards are:

process and investigate it.)

NOSENKO‘'s counterintellicence production includes all of his
information on the Soviet intelligence ard security organs: -

~ their structure, functions, methods, and procedures;
-— their officers, and their agents of Soviet citizenship:

- their operational activities inside and outside the
ussr. :

For the most part this portion of the paper (as in Part VIII.C. :
through Part VIII.P.) follows a format in which the evidence is 7
summarized, the facts interpreted, and conclusions presented. i

2. KSB Orgenization, Personalities Methods

Ability to discuss the structure of his service in general
and at least some of its components in particular is an absolutely
minimal requirement for anyone who claims to have bees erployed
within that service. At the same time, current infoszation or the
organization of an intelligence service is of class:c interest to
opposing intelligerce ard security services. Organizational
changes are indicators of policy and planning trends in the ser-
vice; shert of a penetration of the service's leadership, such
changes are pechaps the most reliable reflection of changes in |

i

operational emphasis and tactics.

Had NOSENKO's information on the organization of the KGB
been novel in this sense, it would have been of cor. erable
value, while the exposure of this unformation--elthough perhaps
not a major loss to the Soviets--woule nonetheless have been
against the KGB's best interests. NOSENKO's repects on the
organization of the. KGB in 1964 (Paces 352-358) agree with and
are a logical extension of that framework of KGB organization 1
newly revealed by the 1961 sources, but this weighs neither for + :
nor against him as the source In the absence of cortradictory *
information, he cannot be subject to criticism or to suspicion : i
pecause his reports show no redirection of the thrust of the
KGB. Purthermore, NOSEXKO's statements indicating that there 2
have been no major changes in the years between the 1959 re~
organization and 1964 are acgeptadie in the light of available
information from other sources. The information which NOSENKO
provided on the KGB's organization therefore neither supports
nor discredits his bona fides.

RNOSENKO's information 0: some 1,090 Soviets connected with |
intelligence and security activities is en impressive echieve-
ment of memory. These identifications, however, must be evalu-
ated according to the damage inflicted upon the Soviets by his
exposure of these personalities. In this respect, the discus~
sion must concern new identifications, for intelligence person-
alities previously exposed could not be damaged any further by
+ @ repetition of their compromise. This discussion mist be fur-
: ther restricted to new identifications of staff personnel, be-
cause the entire Soviet population is available to the KGB for Hat
occasional use as it sees fit, with the loyalty and discretion
of the individual as the only limiting factors; to learn that a
Soviet employed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is an agent re-
porting to the KGS is to learn nothing that has not already
been taken for granted, and besices, no action on such infor-
mation can be taken. Finally, the new identifications also

must be ameng persons who are fdentifiable an¢ accessible, or the
1s ro loss to the

information is useless to Western services ar
Soviets. On this besis, only KGB First Chief
as GRU identifications merit inclusion ir this since
these are the officers who normally appear atroed and participate
in agent operations. Although KGS Second Chi Directorate per-
sornel have in the past transferred to the First Chief, Directorate,
this is rot a predictable evert and cannot be considered in dis-
cussion of current damage.

These personality sdentificazions hence do not serve as evidence

of ROSENKO's bona fides, At the sare time, his inability to ao
further measurable farm to the ¥0u ir this regacd cannot be held
against him, either, for he has Claisred service only an the Second
Chief Directorate throughout his cereer and so cannot be expected
to know a high percentace of the First Chief Lirectorate comple-
ment. Therefore,

NOSEKKO has been the source of imany interest ing details and
examples of KGB nodus operandi (Pages 359-3€9), but while useful
for illustrative purposes end valuable because of the fact that
the meterial was easily coliatable for study purposes, nene of
the methods described could ke consicercd new and revealing, and
their exposure in any event would rot pre: t their continued use
in the future. NOSENKO's discussion of tt only double agent case
in whicn he claimed to have played a role, however, Gemonstrates
his lack of knowledge of the principles and pirposes of such an
operation. This case, PELITSKLY, is a subset of separate

and defectors’ estimates). NOSENKO was not entirely accurate
concerning even KGB officers on his own delegation in Geneva,
as noted on Pages 12 and 13. Therefore, the accuracy of
ROSENKO's original idertifications, positive or negative,
cannot be accepted without question.

discussion below. This subject, tuo, must be considered neutral
evidence in the bona fides assessment.

NOSENKO has shown himself to be both uninformed and inaccurate
in nis answers to questicns on KGB Headquarters staff procedtres
(Page 360 and Pages 639-624). He has deen unadie to contribute
any new information, although there has been no cetailed reporting
on the subject since 1954. (GOLITSYN in 1962 provided some new
material cn procedures but was never comprehensively cebriefed on
the topic.) Thus, information on the more up-to-date forms, co~
ordinaticn requirements, mechanization of records and tracing
mechanisms, etc., could have heen a singular contribution to our
knowledge; NOSENKO could not describe anything of this sort. When
he replied to questions about such matters for the period covering
his entry into the KGB, on which orevious reporting is available
in detail, he answered incorrectly ca nurerous points. NOSENKO's
tendency to improvise when he did not know the correct answer oF
when he had forgotten has been characterized by a CIA psychologist
as the behavior of a pathological liar saving face in a tight
psychological situation. When he could not produce a correct

verveer in this area of reporting, NOSENXO may have improvised
because he is a liar or hecause he is concealing an ignorance
{based on aot having been a KGB Headquarters officer.

3. Cperational Leads

a. Introduction

Consideration of NOSENXO's operational leads must take into
account the KGB positions and personal associaticns (with attendant
faccesa to information) which NOSEKZO has claimed for himself. He
didicated that the breadth of his knowledge about KGB agent opera~
tions and development cases increased as he rose from case officer
in the U.S. Embassy Section in 1953-1955 and in the American Tourist
Section in 1955-1958 to become Deputy Chief of the latter section
jn 1958-1959, Deputy Chief of the U.S, Embassy Secticn in 1960-1961,
and finally Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department from 1962 until
his defection. Simultaneously he established iasting contacts with
his KGB colleagues so that, for example, even after leaving the
U.S. Embassy Section for the second time, in December 1961, NOSENKO
kept abreast of its most important acti ities. On these grounds
NOSERKO presented himself as an authoritative source, one who
could detail the successes and failures of the KGB in recruiting
Westerners--especially Americans--in the USSR over the years from
1953 through 1963. Repeatedly NOSENKO asserted that his leads to
KGB agents constituted proof of his bona fides.

b. Operations Involving Americans

NCSENKO drew a picture of the recruitment scene in Moscow
showing that:

= Since the-"ANDREY" case of the early 1950's* the KGB
recruited no Americans on the U.S. Embassy staff, succeed-
ing only in recruiting one contract employee who was in
Moacow on TDY, KOSENKO reported on recruitment approaches
to six American officials stationed in Moscow, all of who

refused to collaborate with the KCB. He discussed 14 develop-
ment cases which never culminated in recruitment approaches
to these U.S. Government employees in Moscow, and he named

11 officials at the Moscow Embassy who were investigated by
the KG3, ‘These operations, NOSENXO assertcd, comprised the
total KGB activity acainst Enbassy personnel with the ex-
ception of the technical penetrations (see Part VITI,B.4.).

- Seven American correspondents in Mescow had-been re-
cruited Ly the KGB, four of them known to NOSENKO from the
years 1953-1954 when he was working against U.S. newspaper-
men. Another two were under development by the KGB during
that period,

- The ¢merican Express Company representative in Moscow,
Arsene FRIFPEL, had become a KGB agent in 1959; NOSENKO was
the case officer. i

- The number of Anerican visitors recruited by the KGS
in 1962-1963 was 14, and if there had been others, NCSENKO
would have kaown ebout them in light of his senior position
in the Tourist Depertment Curing that period. Moreover, for
the years kefore 1962, NOSFKO provided leads to 19 other
American tourists whom the KGB recruited, plus one who was
serving the GRU when he came to Moscow. ISENKO. also de-
scribed 18 development cases and nine investigations in
which the targets were Anerican tourists.

As for KGB operations outside the Soviet Union, NOSENKO gave leads
to four recruited Americans about whom he learned through conver-
gations with KGB associate a U.S. intelligence officer having
the KGB eryptonym "SASHA" (still unidentified), a pen2tration of
Orly Courier Transfer Station (identified as Sergeant Robert Lee
JCHNSCN), and two agents in Gereva (naines not given and as yet nct
positively identified). NOSENKO leagned of the KS agent status
int Sfre G. LUNT] an Acerican professor, because he tock part in
| =

recruitment while on TOY in Sofia, and of the

agent = because of the connection
between @ERER and Bernera ROTs< an Averican tourist with whose
case NOSENKO was personally involved. In addition, NOSEIKO de-
scribed two development cases with U.S. citizens, From his know-
ledge of the “SASHA" operation, NOSENKO also knew that the KGB
had no ager.t sources able to supply information concerning the
Cuban missile crisis of October 1962,

(i) Completeness, Accuracy, Detail and Consistency of. Reporting

If he occupied the various KGB positions as claimed, if his
access were as broad as he said it was, NOSENKO has provided a

._ eemprehensive. review of KGS operations involving Americans in

the USSR.

Other information, however, contradicts NOSENKO's assurances
that he reported on all major cases involving Americans working
at the U.S. Exbassy in Moscow: -

- GOLITSYN's reports indicate that a U.S. military code
clerk was recruited in 1960, and other factors point toward
this person being Janes STORSBERG or possibly William HURLEY
(Pages 166-182). NOSi%KO, the supervisor of operations
against Exbassy coce clerks in 1960-1961, stated that



STORSBERG rejected the recruitment approach, and when inter-
viewed on the basis of the NOSENKO lead, STORSBERG confirmed
this. Both agree the approach was made in the latter part
of 1961. oA

- GOLITSYN's reports cover six other operations (Paces
595-598) which NOSENKO has not mentioned: The KG3's recruit-
ment of a female employee at the Embassy in 1957, the pre-
sence of a code clerk in the Embassy in 1960 who was a KG3
agent, an unsuccessful recrui nt approach to a female sec-
retary at the Embassy prior to July 1960, the KG2 plan to
complete the recruitment of én Anericer diplomat following
his reassignment from Moscow in 1959, the KGB's recruitment
of or planned recruitment approach to a U.S. Embassy employee
(possibly a code clerk) prior to April/May 1960, and a KGB
officer's trip to Helsinki to accompany ar Embassy ‘code clerk
traveliing by train to Moscow. (There 15 documentary evi-
dence to support the accuracy of GOLITSYN's statements ebout
the last of these cases: see beiow.)

On the basis of available information, NOSENKO cannot be
faulted on the completeness of his reporting about American tour-
ists recruited, approached, and under development by the KGB, but
he could cite only one instance of KGB investigations uncovering

George BLAKE of MI-6 in July 1959 (before the end of the tourist

NOSEXKO's reporting on individual cases wherein he was a per-
sonal participant or supervisor is not, with few exceptions, con-
tradicted by information available from other sources. Nearly all
of his statements have proven accurate when they could be compared
with collateral information: In fact, the Americans whom he cited
did visit or live in the Soviet Union, and many of them ere known

to have been of operational interest to the KGB,

as NOSENKO said.

The exceptions to his general accuracy of reporting, however, are
of major importance in themselves and in reference to his claimed
positions in the U.S, Embassy. Section during 1960-1961:*

u? SECRET

In addition, a number of Americans--e.g.+ Walter RASK, Adam
BROCHES, Henry APISSON, Herbert HOWARD, Vasiliy VOLKOV, d@illiam
WALLACE, Thomas Whitney, and Stanley ZIRING--denied having been
recruited by the KGB, as NOSENKO said they had been.

The only noteworthy internal inconsistencies in NOSENKO's
reporting on KGB operations involving Americans appear in the

HARMSTONE case, where he has given conflicting information on the --.

KGB's ability to obtain photographic evidence of his homosexuality,
and in his advice on how to identify ANDREY"--that he was the only

witness to testify in Roy RHCDES' trial and that he did not testify J}

at Roy RHODES' trial but was enly interviewed in the pre-trial in-
vestigation once. Part VIII.b. covers the extent of his knewledge
about American cases in which he took part persorelly or as &
supervisor. Regarding others to which his official positions did
net give him access, NOSENKO has indicated that it was his per-
sonal contact with KGB colleagues which enabled him to report on
nine recruitments (Herbert HOWARD, Sam GAFFE, the KGS agent in
France, the YOUNGER couple, “SASHA", and two unnamed agents in
Geneva); three development cases (George VAN LAETHEM, Attorney
General Robert KENNEDY, and Stephen HOFFMAN); three unsuccessful
recruitment approaches (Richard HARMSTONE, Peter BINDER, and
Collette SCHWARZENBACH); and three investigations (Thomas BARTHE-
LEMY, Lewis BOWDEN, and George WINTERS), NOSENKO's alleged asso-
ciates in the KGB thus gave him the names of four recruited agents
and sufficient details for one more to be identified by subsequent
investigation, JOHNSON, All of the NOSENKO leads to developmental
operations, unsuccessful recruitment approaches, and investigations
have been identified.

(44) Damage to the Soviets

Three criteria can. be used in assessing the harm to Soviet
interests caused by NOSENKO's operational leads to Americans:

First, the originality of nis information on recruited
agents and unsuccessful recruitment approaches;

Second, the agents’ access to classified information
at the time he reported on them; and

Third, the possibility of identifying them on the
basis of the details provided or in cc* tion with details
received from other sources. ~

There is no reason to believe that NOSENKO's information on 22
Americans under investigation while in the USSR could have damaged
the KGB, especially since all of them had left the Soviet Union
before the NOSENKO leads were received (Pages 402-410). In an-

(Pages 379-397), there is no means for evaluating their impor~
tance to the KGB because it is impossible to estimate with con-
fidence the likelihood of the KGB recruiting some or any of these
targets; vulnerability and assessment data, when coupled with
spasmodic or even continuing KGB access to the target, would be
no guarantee that he is recruitable. Nevertheless, following
the criteria listed above, NOSE..40's statements on KGB operation-
al interest stemming from their homosexuality did bring about the
recall of Robert ARMSTRONG and Stephen HOFFMAN from the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow.

——— ny

NOSENKO was the first source to report on the KGB recruit-
ments of 22 tourists (none with access to classified materials
and on 11 of whom there was previous derogatory information) ;
four correspondents (one said by NOSi.:KO to have becone inactive
and on two of whom there was previous derogatory information) ;
the American Express Company representative in Mosce¢d; a contract.
employee of USIA who had earlier declared his intent to marry 2
Soviet national; and two agents whose names were not known to
NOSENKO but who were identifiable. The latter two agents were:

= Dayle W. SMITH (KGB cryptonym “ANDREY"), a cipher
machine mechanic at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow recruited in
1953, Despite NOSENKO's statement that " DREY" was current-
ly supplying valuable information in June 1962, £MITH lost
his access to classified information through retirement from
the U.S. Army on 30 November 1961, or about six months before
NOSENKO first reported on him (Pages 413-426).

- U.S, Army Sergeant Robert Lee JOHNSCN, who with his
wife Hedwig began colleborating with the KGS in 1952 and
who made James MINTKENBAUGH an agent of the KGB in 1953
(Pages 427-462). Hedwig JOiNSCN discontinued her role in
the operation in 1953, although thereafter remaining know-
ledgeable of the KGB activities of her husband and MINTKEN-
BAUGH; according to MINTKENBAUGH, who lost access to classi-
fied information in 1954, he had no direct contact with the
KGB after the late summer or early autumn of 1963 (about
three to five months before NOSENKO first gave the lead on
JOHNSON); JOHNSON was still on active duty with the U.S.
Army and in contact with the KGB when NOSENWKO reported in
January 1964 about the existence of this agent.

Thus from a total of 30 original and identifiable leads, only one
agent had access to classified information as of the date when
NOSENKO's reporting on him began. By the criteria given in the
preceeding paragraph, the single operational lead from NOSENKO
which could have damaged Soviet interests was that which un-
covered JOHNSON.

It is debatable, however, whether the JOHNSO' lead consti-
tuted a serious loss to the KGB. In the first place, if JOHNSON
can be believed, he gave the Soviets but one classified document
while in charge of the "Ctassified Control Center" at Camp Des
Loges between August 1963 and May 1964. His KGB case officer
later told him, JOHNSON said, that the information he could pro-
vide was not worth the risk involved and that no future attempts
of this sort should be made. JOHNSON also stated that he felt
his espionage work at Camp Des Loges had not been very profitable
for the Soviets, adding that his case officer had shown dis-
interest in his proposal to obtain for the KG2 a top secret
document he (JOHNSON) thought. of greater importance than any
other to which he had access. (NOSENKO indicated that JOHNSON ~~
lost his access in the spring of 1963, while at the Orly Courier
Transfer Station.) In the second place, as the KGB knew, the
behavior of Hedwig JOHNSON, a mental case, was unpredictable.
Finally, the JOHNSON couple and MINTKENBAUGH repeatedly dis-
regarded the KGB's instructions to compartment their activities
and to observe other routine security precautions ‘The KGB
seems to have evoided full exploitation of JOHISON in the latter
stages of the operation, to have been concerned over Hedwig's
mental condition as early as 1962, and to have regarded the

threesone as difficult handling problems. Given these apparent
factors, the NOSZNkO lead may have been considered expencable by
the KGB, without long-lasting adverse effect cn the fulfillment
of its overall intelligence requirements.

NOSENKO was the first source to identify Janes STORSBERG, a
U.S. military code clerk stationed at the Moscow Embassy, as a
target who had rejected the KGB's recruitment offer (Pages 165-
185). The information was received from NOSENXO after STORSBERG
was discharged from the U.S. Army, and when inte viewed on the
basis of this information, STORSBERG generally confirmed NCSENXO's
reporting on the case. GOLITSYN had earlier repertec cn what may
have been the same KGB operation, but GOLITSY.i believed the mili-
tary code clerk had been recruited; from what GOLIT: had pre-
viously told CIA end from later investigations, it seems possible
that the KGB recruited either STOKSBERG or Wiliiam HURLEY (who
NOSENKO said was ret recruited or approached by KGB). If it
is-assumed that STCRSBERG was not recruited in the approach de-
scribed by NOSENKO and in the operation discussed by GOLITSYN,
the KGS suffered no loss in the American services learning of
this case. 1f it is assumed cn the other hand that STCRSBERG or i
HURLEY was recruited, the reporting by NOSENKO assisted the KGB-~ i
not the Aterican services--by deflecting security investigations :
from a recruited agent of the KGB. .

(iii) Importance or Usefulness

The American leads from NOSENK® enabled U.S. security author-
ities to:

= Confirm previous information on the recruitments of
13 tourists and three correspondeats;

- Verify previous derogatory information on 11 tourists,
two correspondents, and perhaps one military code clerk,
STORSBERG;

~ Remove two homosexuals from the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow; and

~ Identify 32 KGB agents including Hedwig COHENSON and
MINTKENBAUGH. *

One or possibly two of these 32 agents (SMITH and possibly HOWARD)
in the past had been in a position to pass classified infcrmation
to the KGB, and a third (JOHNSON) had current access to classified
information and current contact with the KGB; the two homosexuals
at the Moscow Embassy (APMSTRONG and HOFFMAN)“ presumably also had
access to classified information. From the stancpoint of pro-
tecting the security of the U.S. Government, NOSENXO brought t

dng ARMSTRONG and HOFFMAN.

Against this product of NOSENKO's reporting must be balanced
the amounts of money and manpower that were needed for U.S. secu-
rity authorities to exhaust and investigate NOSENKO's information
on 49 recruitments, 35 developmental targets, seven unsuccessful
recruitment approaches, ard 33 investigations by the KGB--a total
of 113 operational leads. CIA carried the burden of the debriefing -
and interrogation of NOSEXKO on these cases, but the investigative

work in the United States was accomplined mostty by other
agencies. It would seem, however, that the JGHNSON Operation
was the only NOSEZKO lead to be important or useful.

(av) Remarks.

Judged by his major inaccuracies and by the demonstrable in-
completeness in scme of his reporting, NOSENKO is not an authori-
tative or reliable source of informa’ nm on cperations against
Americans by the U.S. imbassy Section end the zmerican Tourist

Section. Proven untrustwortay in other categories of operational

Hleads, there is no reascn to accept at face value NOSENKO's state-

wment that SMITH was the only Mosccw Embassy expleyee working with
the KGB from 1953 thrcugh 1963; indeed, evidence to the contrary
exists. The same may be true regarding Americe: tourists and
correspondents in Moscow, i.e., other -ecruitmeats pot mentioned
by NOSENKO could have occurred. Furthermore, with the question-
able exception of the JOHNSON case, the KGB lost nothing of great
value in consequence of NOSENKO's leads but gained an advantage
by occupyirg the attention and facilities of American security
authorities.

It is therefore concluded that NOSENKO has withhold infor-
mation on recrvitrents of Americans in Moscow, or he is unable to
provide a conprehensive review of such activities because he did
not _hold_the claimed positions in the U.S. Embassy and American
Tourist Sections. Either explanation forces str reservations
about the bona fices of NOSENKO as a genuine scurce, and these
reservations are reinforced by the relative costs to the KGB and
U.S. security authorities of the NOSENKO leads. . By itself, this
evaluation of his production on American cases suggests the possi-
bility that the KGB dispatched NOSENKO to report to CIA, and that
the KGB did so for tre purpose of misleading the U.S. security
services.

c. Cperations Involving other Westerners

(i) In

duction

As already indicated, NGSENXO's principal knowledgeability
of KGB operations is rclated to Americans in the Soviet Union.
With the exception of one Gerzan and one Norwegian tourist case,
his only other personal participation in third-national (i.e., non-
American) operations stems fron his agrociation with the section
of the Tourist Department concerned with United kingdom and Canad-
ian, as well as /urerican, tourists, Where he has commented on
sources fer the rest of his tnird-national leads, he indicated
his knowledge was acquired either through conversaticns with
other officers or through his position as Peputy Chief of the
Tourist Department in 1962-1963. Thus he made ro claim for com-
pleteness of his coverage, nor necessarily for absolute accuracy
and full details on ery one case. No attempt will be made here,
therefore, to compare his infcymution with cther sources, except
in terms of whether ENYO's reporting harmed the Soviets and
assisted Mmerican security.

knowing the status of these two overaticns at the time NOSENKO
told CIA abczt them, it is not possible to measure the value to
tus or the damage to the Soviet Union thrcugh the compromise of

,these cases.

Of the remaining 68 known or possible agents who have been
identified, 35 were unique leads when NOSENKO provided them. No
conclusive investigation results have yet been obtained on 30 of
these, but the majority were said by NOSENKO to be travel agency
employees (guides, bus drivers, etc.). Five of the 39 held
positions of trust in their respective governments; these five
leeds are discussed below in terms of fotential value to U.S.

security and potential damage to the KGB. Of the five who have been

interviewed on the basis of the NOSENKO information, four denied
hoinz recruited by the KGB, includin (the. only: one
or those interviewed holding 2 government position), discussed
below. Reporting on the one remaining lead, a Dutch woman, is
unclear and inconclusive--she admitted only to having been ques~
tioned while in the USSR.

Among the 35 new leads from NOSENKO, a total of five had
positions of trust, with known or presumed access to sensitive
information, in their respective governments: i

When they received the fragnent Of NOSENKO information which
focused on the British Embassy in Moscow, the number was reduced
to VASSALL and one other. Although the NOSEIKO information
apparently confirmed the already solid suspicions of VASSALL,
there is reasc Jieve that the identification would have
peen BGcomplished without this information. The lead was there-
fore not new or exclusive information, and NOSEXKO himself ad-
mitted in 1964 that he knew that GOLITSYN had known of the case
from the latter's work in the Information (Reports) Department.

Of the identified third-nationals whom NOSENKO said were
being tergetted or investigated by the KGB. nore held positions
of significance, with t excention of the then member of
the British Parliament, whose personal life
and career the Soviets subsequently atce: pted--with considerable
success--to cestroy through a campaign of scandal.

(ii) Remarks

On the basis of the atove examination, NOSENKO'S information
on KGB operations against third-nationals cannot be considered 8
positive factor in the assessment of his rena fides. As 8 poss-
ible negative factor in consideration of his pona fides, the in-
significance of NOSENKO's reporting on third-na) ional leads must
pe measured against the criteria of his claimed access and con-
trary evidence. In the case of foreign tourists his leads show--
and he himself has commented -that such _reeruitments were of no
particular value; assuming that NUSENKO was Deputy Chiet of th2
Tourist Department, he snould be able to make such & statement
without challenge. To cate no independent evidence of foreign
tourist recruitments has emerged which contradicts him. Opera-
tions against other Western embassies in Moscow are & slightly
different matter. NOSENKO's information, oF lack thereof, can-
not be evaluated on the basis of completeness because he has made
no claim to full access to such information or to positions which
would have given him better access- Except for tnose he said he
was informed of in connection with possibie use against U.S.
Embassy targets, he has usually sourced such third-national
leads as he did have to particularly close relations with the
responsible case officer. ‘It would not be valid to argue that
a source cf one lead should have told him of others, or that he
should have had mere close friends in the KGB. Thus on all
applicable criteria, the NOSEXKO leads to operations against
third-naticnals must be excluded as a factor weighing for or i
against his bona fides.

1962 that the 1955 Stalingrad incident was written up in KGB
training materials a3 an example of Second Chief Directorate
work. The training version may have included the role of the

flarly, it was never clear why NOSENKO did not remember in 1962
that there were eleven points--as the list showed--rather than
the four-to-3ix NOSENKO reported on in 1962.

NOSENXO's account’ of how the product from the microphones was
distributed and exploited would inevitably mean that all XGB case
officers who had served in the U.S. Embassy Section since the
microphones were installed would know of their existence--despite
any effort to paraphrase and disguise the product as “agent re-
ports.“ NOSENKO nonetheless maintained in 1962 that “it is a
tremendous secret thet we are listening to you," and that the
microphones were known to so few that any countermeasures the
Americans might take on the basis of NOSENKO's statements could
reflect dangerously on him asthe source.* .

Accepting at face value NOSENKO's claimed lack of aptitude
and interest in technical matters, and therefore nis inability
@ provide specific technica! details concerning electronic oper-
ations against the American Embassy, it is still noteworthy that:

= NOSENKO did not know the purpose of the so-called
“Moscow beam," sometimes saying it was to jam Embassy
communications and at other times that it was used to
monitor them.

= Although he claimed to have personally participated
in the planning for the installation of audio devices in
the North Wing of the Embassy, he dic not know of the ex-
istence or the purpose of the coaxiel cables and grill
found there by American technicians in 1964. (NOSENKO
insisted that there were no audio devices installed in the
North Wing at the time of its, renovation for occupancy
by Americans.)

~ NOSENKO knew nothing of the genera) lines of research
and development to substitute for or improve the fading
microphone coverage of the U.S. Embassy.

These three points relate to aspects of the KGE's audio-technical
attack on the U.S. Embassy in which the reporting of a source in
NOSENKO's claimed position, no matter what his technical aptitude,
could have been detrimental to Soviet interests.

_ That they botn xnew or sueeeeied
phones suggests that NOSENKO exaggerated the sensitivity of

the microphone cperation, which had moreover always been
assumed by the Embassy to be active.

b. Remarks

NOSENKO's sourcing of his information on electronic opera-
tions against the U.S, Embassy in Noscow was unclear and unlikely.
His knowledge of the location and production of these microphones,
as well as the existence, nature, and purpose of other electronic
operations directed against the Embassy, was not commensurate with
his alleged position in the U.S. Bnbassy Section ard his particu-
lar responsibility for audio sperations. Significantly, the
essential element of the information which NOSENKXO did report,
the existerce of the microphone in the Minister Counselor's
office, would presumably have been considered by the KGB to have
been compromibta-s[x months earlier, with the deFection or COLiT-
SYNz—Discovery of this microphone, as an outgrowth of action on
GOLITSYN's informstion, would have Jed to all the others. Thus
the Embassy microphones must have beer ccrsidered by the KCB to
have been compromised before NOSENKO first spoke of them in 1962,
dddec to this 1s the fact (supported by NCSENKO himself) that
ine efficiency of the Embassy microphone installation as a whole
had seriously diminished by late 1961 or early 1962 due to, first,
normal deterioration of equipment and wiring and, second, the
installation of secure rooms and the implerentation of more
stringent security precautions at the Embassy. For these reasons
and in the absence of any information concerning other forms of
electronic attack against the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, it cannot
be considered that the information provided by NOSENKO in 1962
and 1964 was harmful to the interests of the KGB nor helpful to
imezican authorities, NOSENKO's denial of any insesTiatrond7in
the north wing, in the light of the later discovery there of
coaxial cables, the purpose of which appears serious and is as
yet unclarified, and in the light of NOSENKO's specific claim to
have been responsible for the operational planning for the north
wing at the time it was being prepared for Arerican occupancy,

would appear to be purposeful deception.

5, The BELITSKI¢ Case

The BELITSK=Y Case

a. Introduction

NOSENKO reported to CIA in June 1962 (as one of the two items
he wanted to sell) that ohe of its agents, the Soviet interpreter
BELITSKIY, was in fact a KGB double agent who had been planted on
CIA (Pages 517-529). NOSENKO said that this was a case run by the
Second ("Active Line") Section, but thet he personally had a role
in the management of the case in May 1962 in Geneva. NOSENKO was
able to give certain inside information on this case; for exemple,
he knew the nicknames used by the CIA case officers with the agent.

NOSENKO's information, at least in its general outlines, was
correct. CIA had been running BELITSKIY as an agent, and the CIA
case officers (alias "Bob* and “Henry,” the latter from Washington
as NOSENKO said) nad just completed a series of meetings with
BELITSKIY in Geneva, Important aspects of his information were
imaccurate: HELITSKIY had been recruited a year before NOSENKO's
date of 1959, and in Brussels, not London. Also, NOSENKO's clzin
that this was 2 Second Chief Directorete operation aimed at en-
ticing CIA into meetings in the USSR was not borne out by the
history of the case or by PELITSK1Y's conduct, although it cannot
be excluded that this was a long-term objective which the KGB
still sought witnout appeering to. NOSENKO'S account of the case
thus is not as accurate as could be expected if his own role in
it had been as claimed.

_ NOSENKO's description of his own involvement is not consis-
tent with observed Soviet practice or with operational logic.
NOSENKO said in both 1962 and 1964 that he had had orders to
supervise the handling oF this case in Geneva in the spring of
1962. The reason was that the case officer for BELITSKIY in
Geneva .(ARTEMEV) was young end inexperienced and had not even
worked on the BELITSKIY case before. NOSENKO was saying in
effect--with the authority of direct knowleige and official re-
sponsibility--that BELITSKiY, a prominent Soviet citizen having
personal contacts with well placed memters of the Soviet Govern-
ment, a man who had beer under the ostensible control of a hos-
tile intelligence service (CIA) for four years, was sent by the
KGB to Geneva for the purpose of recontacting CIA, with pre-

i pared information, but that the KGB did not send with him the

i responsible case officer or any member of the section responsible
i for the operation. Instead, the KGB turned over the responsi-

i bility to a young and inexperienced KGB officer who happened to
be in Geneva to protect the security of a delegation and who
had hed no prior connection with the BELITSKIY case nor even
local knowledge of Geneva cenditions; then, after BELITSKIY was
already in Geneva, the KGB had cabled instructions that NOSENKO,
who had no need to know of the case and had learned of it only
unofficially from conversations in 1960-1961 with the Section
Chief responsible, who had no experience or training in handl-
ing double agent operations, ard who was similarly in Geneva

by chance with delegation security functions, shovlé guide the 7
other “less experienced” case officer.* As NOSENKO showed
under questioning, he did net know the contents of any of the
positive intelligence BELITSKIY was to pass to CIA as disinfor-
mation; he did not know BELITSKIY's Moscow or Geneva pattern

of movement or contacts; he did not know in detail how or when
the operation started; he did not know the nature of degree of
British involvement, nor the operational details and contact
arrangements. NOSENKO said that BEOLITSKIY had been placed on a
Geneva delegation in the hope that CIA might be able to *find"
and recontact him.**

c. Remarks

The circumstances above not only cast doubt on NOSENKO'S
version of the case and his own access but also suggest that
NOSENKO did not have a theoretical eppreciation of how double
agents are handled. The examples he gave of his "guidance" to
ARTEMEV are few in number. NOSENKO also stated in 1964 that he
had arranged the actual introduction to viLITSKIY of RISLOV, the
TASS man, to provide for BELITSKIY's neca of a notional subsource
for some of his disinformation; NOSENKO by October 1966 had appar-
ently forgotten this event, for he stated unequivocally that KIS-
LOV had had no connection whatever with the BELITSKIY case. Nos-
ENKO claimed to have met BELITSKIY, but did not recognize his
pheto when shown it in 1966.

Did NOSENKO's report to CIA on the BELITSKIY case harm the
KGB? It was useful to CIA, since despite frejuently expressed
doubts of RT¥7s bona fides, CIA vas handling the operation i
as if it were genuine (but not Intending to yo to the extent of
exposing to BELITSKIY CIA assets inside the USSR). (The KGB is

¥HOSENRO has reported that he handled only one American agent

as early as August 1958, a role in jer Opera

tions against American tourists in 1959--including clandestine
search (see Page 148), and continuous American Department
service since then. NOSENKO did not know of the 1953-1959
operational activities of ARTEMEV, although they feil in the
operational area NOSENKO claimed to have supervised at the
time as Deputy Chief of the American Tourist Section.

#* NOSENKO was seemingly unaware that BELITSKIY had contact
arrangements which would presumably guarantee recontact.

aware, as Soviet Bloc counterintelligence guidance demonstrates,
of the dangers inherent in having disinformation recognized as
such.) The meetings in Geneva in May 1962 would have made it
clear to the KGB that CIA had no intentions of meeting BELITSKIY
inside the USSR, and, in KGB eyes, the case may have reached the
point of diminishing returns, It is perhaps significant that
NOSENKO did not contact CIA and report on the BELITSKIY case until
10 days after BELITSKIY's series of meetings with CIA in Geneva
had been completed, which would have given the KGB time for final
appraisal of the operation's potential.

NOSENKO's account of his own role in this operation appears
to have been false, and nothing in the available evidence would
preclude Soviet sacrifice of this already tired operation. Since
NOSENKO provided some inside details of a sensitive KCB operation
which could have been known to only a few, it is difficult to
find any other explanation of NOSENKO's access to.this information
except that the KGB briefed him about it.

The only other evidence available is analytical. POPOV was
transferred to the Illegals handling unit in Berlin on 26 June
1957, an assignment of high sensitivity. Until mid-August he
handled five Illegals, thereafter only one, TAIROVA, in October
1957. - Following home heave from 12 December 1957 to 19 January
1958, he was again transferred, this time to a position where
Illegals and productive GRU sources of antellicgence were not ex-
posed to him. Between March and November 1958 there were signs
Of a KGB investigation of the Illegals handling. unit where POPOV
formerly served, and he was recalled to Moscow ‘in: November of that
year. These facts can ke interpreted as follows:

- POPOV's status as a CIA source was not compromised before
his transfer to the Illegals handling unit.

= POPOV's status was compromised before his recall to Moscow
in November 1958, probably before his reassignment from the
Illegals hendling unit in January 1958, and possibly some time
earlier. The latter possibility is apparent from the Soviets*
knowledge that the TAIROVA couple was under surveillance in
December 1957 (and until March 1958); it is also noteworthy
that, after having met five Illegals in less than one and one-
jhalf months prior to 13 August 1957, POPOV subsequently was
involved personally with only one other, TAIROVA, in October
1957.

- The KGB, realizing that POPOV was a CIA source, chose to
keep him in Berlin until November 1958 in order to investigate
the possibility of his operating in conjunction with other
CIA sources. if

This line of reasoning, if accepted, would confirm GOLITSYN's in-
formation that a KGB agent compromised POPOV prior to the arrival
o£ ZHUKOV in Berlin, an arrival date falling some time before

23 November 1957.

(Footnotes from preceeding page.)

##***Since such orientation papers are written for general circula-
tion within the KGB, it is doubtful that KGB security prac-
tices would permit their conterts to reveal sensitive infor-
mation; other sources have indicated that orientation papers
sometimes are sanitized; this particular peper, however,
reportedly did state that the KGB learned from an agent ia
about 1957 (GOLITSYN's estimate) that American Intelligence
jhad a source which had provided GRU information.

*#44¢*This date, which is consistent with that cited in the final

sentence of the preceeding footnote, was derived from the
time when POPOV reported the presence of the KGB officer
ZHUKOV in Berlin; according to GOLITSYN, ZHUKOV was sent to

‘Berlin after POPOV had been identified by a KGB agent as
being a source of CIA.

that the ABIDIAN visit ‘sas not the “first observed activity ¢ :

fact that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street drop site on
one cecasion only, and that was on 30 December 1961. The
reference to this as a eecond visit to this address by an
American from the Embassy is a clear indication that the
KGB hed surveilied the first such visit, which was made
ky the CIA officer MALONEY** in Jeavary 1961, and not by 1
ABIDIAN. Thus where ech oer 4 erred by indicating

It must ke noted, nonetheless, that this is the only instance $
among all the versions which places the compromise cn the Arer= * i

connection between the Pushkin Street dead Grop and the KGB
detection of PENKOVSKIY. (All others attribute the compromise
to surveillance of British Embassy personnel, and NOSENKO claim-
ed that the KGB was unaware of American Intelligence participa—
tion until the operation was terminated.) It is also in direct
conflict with NOSEXKO, who had no knowledge of any U.S, Embassy
official visiting the Pushkin Street site prior to ASIDIAN. In

NOSENKO did not know or did not report to CIA that the
only other Arerican who had visited the Pushkin Strect dead drop
area was MAHONEY. This fact suggests that either NOSEIKO was
deliberately withholding from CIA information of vital import-
ance in the PENKOVSKIY compromise. or he was unaware of the
KGB's possession of this information, despite his claimed posi-
tion in the U.S, Embassy Section and responsibility for cover-
age of ABIDIAN. The fact that his story oa the PENKOVSKIY
compromise, like the “official report" of the KGB, does rot
show the seriousness of the evidence in the KG2's possession
as of 27 May 1361 additionally points to his withholding of in-
formation on the subject of the timing of PEIKOVSKIY'’s compro-
mise, which was definitely no later than this date. Tf NOSENKO
was deliberately withholding information on this subject and
lying sbout the PENKOVSKIY compromise, then he is not a bona
fide defector. If he is unaware of the information which the
KGB has in its possession, then he was not in the U.S. Enbassy
Section in 1960 or 1961 as claimed, ard hence his bena fides
would be disproven.

©. Conpronise of CHEREPANOV

(4) Introduction

NOSENKC's stories on the compromises of POPOV and PENKOV~
SKIY were examined for their accuracy as to timing and cause. In
the case of CHEREPANOV (Pages 548-558), there is no question about
when the so-called CHEREPANOV papers were passed, nor how the KGB
openly learned of the U.S. Embassy's possession of the papers.
The chief question is the authenticity of the documents themselves,
with the subsidiary implications, if they are not authentic, that
the passage of the papers was instigated by the KGB, and that
there could have been neither a compromise of nor a search for
CHEREPANOY, as described by NOSENKO and attested to by his travel
authorization (see also Part VIII.D.8.). '

(ii) The Operational Plan in Draft

Examination of oné draft document--the operational plan
against the CiA officer'!WINTERS--reveals the following points
related to form:

- Although only a draft, the title of the case officer,
the designation of his office, the title of his supervisor
as approving authority, and the designaticn of his office
component as well as the title of the confirming authority
(the head of the department) are spelled out in full, even
including the subordination of the KGB to the Council of
Ministers of the USSR. KGB practice, as reported by
cther sources and as logic would dictate, does not require
that this be done, cumbersome as these designations are,
and the typist routinely fills them in as the official
copy is typed from the draft.

- Although only a draft, this document has been signed
by KOVSHUK as being approved, which is against common
sense and KGB practice. NOSENKO himself noted this dis-
crepancy, asking himself aloud why KOVSHUX had done’ this.

’
= Although only a draft, the name of the target of

{ the plan appears several times, but earlier KGB defectors j
have stated and NOSENKO himself has confirmed that the |

7 name is left out of drafts so the typist in the typing
pool will not know the identity of the subject of the
report; a blank line is used wherever the name is to
appear to be filled in by hand by the case officer after
the document comes back from the typist.

~ On the basis of references to LANGELLE and POPOV,
this plan (which is not dated) would have to have been
drafted sometime after October 1959. WINTERS by this 7
time had been in Moscow since August 1958, had been de~
tected in operational letter-mailing, and had been
associating with KGB officers, etc. Neither this

operational plan nor any other of the drafts included in
the CHEREPANOV package cited a KG3 cryptonym for hin, and
fhe ie always referred to in true name, but this is contrary
to the usage in the other operational plans in the package.
It is also contrary to KGB practice, as described by NOSEI-
KO and other sources.

- The draft cited several technical aids to be used in
the clandestine study of wINTERS. It not only gives the KGB
cryptonym of metka and “Néptun-80" for two of these techni-
ques, but inmediately thereafter explains for what purpose
each one of them is used. In the otner operational plans
from CHEREPANOV, and in conformance with the established
KGB practice of inserting cryotonvms for such devices,
these preparations are not only not described, but the
blank line typed by the typist has been filled in by hand
after typing.

In addition to the above points of form, this same document
contains statements which run counter to rigid KGB practice and
which are internally contradictory, especially noteworthy in an
approved draft. One of the objectives announced in the plan is
to investigate two Soviet citizens who were detected in contact
with WINTERS in Moscow; one of the two is identified parenthetic-
ally as having gone abroad. This document, if genuine, would be
an admission on the part of the case officer, and an approval
thereof by his supervisor, that a Soviet citizen who had been
observed in contact with an identified officer of Averican intel-
ligence had been cleared by the KGB for travel abroad before the
nature of that contact had been satisfactorily determined by the
KGB, This {s in contradiction to all available information con-
cerning KGB travel clearances, which are denied on the basis of
unauthorized contacts between Soviet citizens and foreiqners in
the Soviet Union, not to mention Western Intelligence officers.
The draft, which consists of only three paragraphs. can be sum-
marized briefly by paragraph to demonstrate the internal contra~

. dictions:

- To establish the nature of WINTERS' intelligence
activities in the USSR, six special tasks will be carried
out, including round-the-clock surveillance etka,
“Neptun-80," hidden microphones, other. audi evices.
and investigation of already identified Soviet citizens.

- Because he already been identified as an intelli-
gence operator, and he has a hostile attitude toward the
USSR, there is no basis for recruitment; therefore the
actions outlined in the first paragraph will aot be
carried out because they might alarm him and cause him
to leave the USSR prematurely.

- Despite the statements of the second paragraph,
which indicate that recruitment is out of the question
and which precludes putting into effect the measures
outlined in the first paragraph, this third paragraph
sets forth the expectation that just before WINTERS’
scheduled departure and depending on further accumula-
tion of materials on WINTZRS, and the prevailing pelit-
ical climate a the time, an opportunity is likely to
arise which will permit testing the possibility of
recruiting him.

If the WINTERS\operation plan were a draft like the others in
this collection, the above conflicting and confusing paragraphs
might be explained as variations jotted down as possiple ap-
proaches to presenting a plan for the future, as yet undecided
in direction. This document, however, is the one which--to
NOSENKO's puzzlement--had been approved and signed in draft by
KOVSHUK, as Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, Anericen Depart—
ment, KGB Second Chief Directorate. The preparing case officer,
KUSKOV, had furthermore indicated to the typing poo) that it was
to be typed in one copy, which gives the document the appearance
of a draft which had been or was about to be made a matter of
official KGB record.

The foregoing review of errors, contredictions, and dis-
regard for security considerations in preparation constitutes
evidence that this is not a Genuine KGB draft cocument.

(iid) Tue Summary on LANSELLE

A second docuzent, a handwritten note in what NOSENKO
identified as CHEREPAIOV's own handwriting, alse is pertinent
to the authenticity of the papers and of NOSENKO's account on
GHEREPANOV, This ic a short suxmary of the operational activity
of the CIA officer LANGELLE, covering the compromise of POFOV,
The document says in part: "In January 1959 a letter with secret
writing mailed by a co-worker of the Embassy of the USA in Moscow,
WINTERS, was intercepted and was addressed to a Soviet citizen,
POPOV, a worker of the General Staff of the Soviet Army. Accord-
ing to the contents of the letter, it was clearly established
that POPOV was an Averican agen a

This coincides precisely with NOSENKO's account of POPOV's
compromise (see Pages 532 and 663). Unlike GOLITSYN's recollec-
tion of the official report which he read, there is no reference
in this document to che report of about 1957 from an agent source
that there was a leak of GRU information; nor is there reference
to the indication that the KG3 knew that LANGELLE had been posted
to Moscow in order to handle e special agent, for this reason
placing LANGELLE under heavy surveillance. If both of these
items were in the official report which GOLITSYW read, their
omission from the semaary report in what purports to be CHERE-
PANOV's handwriting is noteworthy, particularly since GHEREPANOV
was supposed to have been in the same office (room) as the case
officer working against LANGELLE during the time the LANGELLE/
POPOV cperation was investigated by the KGB. The latter posi-
tion should lend authority to CHEREPANOV's version of the com-
promise and termination of the casez yet GOLITSYN--informed
only from the official, and presumably sanitized, account--had
more detail, as well as conflicting information, on the same
case. While it is reasonable that a sanitized case surmary
would conceal an agent source of a lead by imputing the dis-
covery to surveillance, it seems less likely, and indeed un-
necessary, to conceal a detection via surveillance by imputing
it to an agent source, In thus supporting NOSENKO and others
as to the cause of PUPOV's compromise, and contradicting
GOLITSYN (who is supported by other evidence accumulated in-
dependently), this document too appears to be a KGB fabrica-
tion. i =

The authenticity of another passage in the sane document is
likewise open to question. This is the description of LANGELLE's
two visits to Lenin Hills, which the documents stated were for

TOP SFrRET


the purposes of casing a drop site end putting down the dead
drop, respectively. The document further stated that the dead
drop had been put down for REPNIKOV, an agent of Auericen Intel-
ligence who had recently been arrested by the Moscow KGB. Two
errors of fact in this passage belie KGB practice as known from at
meny sources? :

_ There ig no reagon to doubt that the KGB observed (
LANGELLE on the two occasions ef his visits to Lenin Hills,
both times to case a proposed dead cron site. oth sites
involved staircases, but they were two different stair-
cases in the same general area of the Lenin Hills park. H
Since it is a fact that LANGELLE did not put down a dead at
Grop on either occasion. KGB surveillance could not have if
seen him do so. If the KGB nad reason to suspect that he
had done so, but could not locate it (since it was not
there). the KGB would feel the necessity--even more than
in the case of ABIDIAN and the Pushkin Street drop--to put
24-hour surveillance on the area for a reasonable length
of time, in order to apprehend the agent for whom it was
intended. The dead drop was not actually put down until
7 June 1958 (during twilight), ten days after the second
casing. Assuming the KGB had not stopped its coverage
of the area after only ten days, the CIA agent who did
put down the dead drop must have been observed doing this.
CHEREPANOV's nate thus erred by attributing to LANGELLE
an action which the KGB knew he had not taken and which
the KGB almost certainly knew someone else had taken.

eee

ey
- At the time the dead drop was put down, it had not ~ : i
been Gesignated for any agent, REPNIKOV included. It i
was a contingency dead drop, to be activated at some
time in the future as necessary; the agent for whom it
might have keen designated could conceivably not even
be recruited until long after the dead drop was loaded.
REPNIKOV, identified in the document as the person in-
tended to unload it, was not a recruited agent of Ameri-
can Intelligence either at the time of the drop-loading ,
or at any time thereafter: neither was any ceed drop :
contemplated for him in the event that he might be re- /
eruited. Nothing that wes in the drop could have sug-
gested REPNIKOV as the intended recipient. Again,
GHEREPANOV's note erroneously and groundlessly assigned
bd the dead drop to REPNIKOV whercas in fact this dead drop
was unassigned by CIA. :

If this document were or purported to be the official '

version of the activities of LANGELLE, in typed or printed t
‘4 form, these errors in fact could be interpreted as intentional
and part of the sanitization, or part of an effort to make the
KGB investigative work look better than it was. As it is a
handwritten copy, supposedly in the writing of.the person who
intended to give the document to the U.S, Government and harm
: the KGB, and since CHEREPANOV supposedly would have had access \
u to the true facts, the absence of some coment further indi-
i cates that the document was intentionally inaccurate and in-
u complete.

(iv) Remarks

That at least two of the documents were not authentic is
evidence that the CHEREPANOV papers were designed by’ the KGB
for American Intelligence consumption. i

There ig no sensitive information contained in any of the
documents; that is, they are not worth the risk of stealing
either in helping the West or damaging the KGB. It is further
questionable how CHEREPANOV wag able to steal drafts destined
for destruction which are dated August 1958, March 1959, and so
on, if he had not acquired his motivation of bitterness against
the KGB until 1961, as indicated by NOSENKO and other sources.
It is also possible to question numerous other aspects of the
CHEREPANOV case, some dating from the eariiest known history of
the man and others more recent. This seems unnecessary in view
of the analysis of the WINTERS document and the LANGELLE summary.

It follows that the CHEREP#NOV incident was a’ provocative
plan of the KGB. NOSENKO's story about CHEREPANOV, a mutually
confirming source on KGB affairs, must be interpreted as an
indication that he has deliberately lied in reporting on the
CHEREPANOV case and his part in the investigation, now shown
to have been spurious. He has also lied in attesting to the
validity of the CiZREPANOV documents and thereby to the validity
of his own information on the same topics which those documents
also covered.

C. Evaluation of Sourcing
1. latroducticn

NOSENKO was able to provide logical and plausible sourcing
for most of his imerican leeds, through his clained professional
assignments. Asong his foreign leads, thcse to ich he hat no
plausible direct access have been various!y sourced to hearsay
from case officer friends (as with VASSALL, from nis friend
CHURANOV) and invoiverent in peripheral
TDY to the city of Viadimir after the A
had been spottec as + homosexual during a vasie<
able sourcing by WOS! @ has occurred in hie statements ca his
one couble agent case, four American cases and three involving
foreigners, They are revievud below because they include the
most important ieads NOSEXKO has provided. 7

2. Discussion

There are two KGB Second Chief Directorate operations ine
volving imericzas which i SERKO has sourced inconsistently or
falsely.

to having heard of it in “bits and pieces” f e =mber of case
officers involved in the case at different t-res; his first kaow-
ledge of it, ke said, was duc to his own employment in the U.S.
Eabassy Section in 1953-1955, “although I worked there quite a
bit jater. But it was kncen." (In 1962 he repeatedly dated the
recruitment as "1949-50.") Dayle SMITH, identified as “ANDFEY",
fixed his recruitment cate around December 1953, end he did not
Jeave Moscow until April 1954. Since ‘SMITH was directly sub-
ordinate to the office of the Army Attache, which was responsible
for the Embassy's code room, NOSENKO as case officer for the Army
Atteches hed a logical reason for knowing rore than he claimed
Sbout the case, including the agent's name. MULE, who succeeded
VAN LRETHEM as ‘cryptographic security officer and SAITH's super-
visor, was supposed to be one of NCSENKO's more active cases at
this time. It is clear from NOSENKO'S inability to claim direct
knowledge of the case that he was not aware of these, facts.

He demonstrated uncertainty in his knowle

of the “ANDKEY" case (Pages 413-420) by making v

In the case of Edward Ellis SMITH (Pages 4638-469), the U.S.
Embassy Security Officer from 1954 to 1¥55, NOSENXO’s ignorance
of the objective facts ef the case led him into statements con~
cerning his own knowledge of the case which cannot be true. In
1962 he claimed to have played a significant role in the attempt
to recruit SMITH, but he admitted after the defection that these
claims were exaggerations designed to make him lock better than
he was at the time. He said the case officer was KOVSHUX, and
GRIBANOV was personally running the operation, byt that ina
sense he did play 2 sole; he was assigned to a phone watch in
support of surveiliance during the final phase cf the case. once
again it is clear that he did aot know the dates of SMITH'S
assignment to Moscow (1954 to 1956) ner did he know that the
operation he has described tock place between } and 5 June 1956,
and that SHITH was recailed from Moscow on 8 June i956. This is
a full year after NOSENKO said he transferrec from the U.S. Lmbassy
Section.

who was personally tnvolved in most of these operat:ons.* Of the
other three, two--the Paris agent (JGHNSON) and the Brussels/NATO
case--he said he picked up in bits and pieces from technicians of
the Second Chie? Directorate's Special Section *ho had assisted in
them. For both of the latter operations, nuzerous coincidences
were alleged by XOSESKO to have enabled hin to obtain the fragaen~
tary ipforaation froa his sub-sources, and he vas never able to
clarify what parts he learned from which ef the four techricians
he named as sub-sourccs.

In describing his acquisition of infornaton on the riath
case, "SASHA," NOSENKXO has contradicted hinself: He first said he
had learned sbout “SASHA" from SHAT YAPIN, providing lergthy and
involved explanations of how he became acquainted sith SHALYAPIN
at the time of the latter's retirement fron the KGB in 1°62. Later,
under interrogation, NOSENKO did not recall his statements that
€HALYAPIN was the original source of the "SASHA" story, first
attributing it to others and later saying that he could not reses—
ber wher and from whoa he first heard it, but SHALYAPIN and others
had talked about it. This was despite the fact that by the time
he heard of “SASHA” he had already met and agreed to cooperate
with CIA; furtherzore, when asxed if “SASHA was an important lead,
ne agreed that it was a serious matter. Except for this one
occasion he lad consistently failed tu appreciate the significance
of sucha lead, indicating that it was not considered amportast io
the. KGB.

“Also casting doubt on his sourcing of “SASHA” is the fact
that; in his first reference to "SASHA" and the Cuban missile crisis
of Cetcber 1962, NOSENKO said he had learred of this item from
SHALYAPIN, whereas later he said it was rot from SHALYAPIN (but he

3. Remarks

NOSENKO's errors concerning “ANDREY" (particularly his early
insistence that "ANDREY" had left Mosccw years before NOSENKO en-
tered the KGB) aake it impossible that NOSENKO could have learned
of the case in the way he later said he did.

NOSENKO's acccunts of how he learned cf the "Paris agent"-are
vague and vary with each telling; they also depend heavily on coin-
cidence. It is notevurthy too that he clained to have been told of
this one operation by no less than four individuals, whereas the
rest of what he learned of First Chicf Directorate operations in
eleven years of KG3 service came from only two ether individuals.
Furthermore, his knowledge of "SASHA" stenned from elaborate and
apparently contrived sourcing which he himself was unable to recon-
struct when pressed for exact details. NOSENKO"s inability to

- give any clear and consistent account of how he heard of either the

"Paris agent" or "SASHA" must be judged ia the 1: of the fact that
he first heard of beth cases only just after proaising to collect
such infortation for CIA. because these were amcag the most iapor-
tant and the most fortuitous items he ever picked up, it could
reasonably be expected that he would renember how he did so, espe-
cially since only a little over a year elapsed until his next
meeting with CIA.

NOSENKO's sourcing for the@@@ESEne leads seens
illogical and fabricated. It also appears that SU? KO has given an

D. Examination of

ISENKO's Intelligence Career
1. Introduction

What follows is an examination of NOSENKO's accounts of his
Soviet Intelligence career, beginning with the years 1951 and
1952, in the naval GRU and continuing with his 11 years in the
U.S. Embassy Section and the Tourist Department of the KG8 Sec-
ond Chief Directorate. NOSENKO's naval service opens the dis-
cussion primarily because, according to his story, it provided
a springboard for bis entrance into the KGB in 1953 with the
rank of lieutenant.

The discussion of each period in his career has two cen-
tral topics: First, NOSENKO's own description of his positions,
responsibilities, and access: and second, ar assessment of this
description from the point of view of internal consistency,
accuracy, and the commensurability of his kuowledge, vperational
activities, and perfermance with his claimed senior and respon-
Bible posts with the KGB and his rise to these posts. This
assessment is based on a comparison of the information supplied
by NOSENKO with collateral information from a variety of overt,
official, defector, and clandestine sources.

NOSENKO's accounts of the various periods in his career are,
of course, cumulative in that his claimed positions and activi-
ties during one stage necessarily affect those of succeeding
periods. Insofar as possible, each period is evaluated within
itself and independently of conclusions earlier reached.

~ He studied for the equivalent of 7th, 8th, 9th and
part of 10th school years in naval schools in Kuibyshev, Baku
and Leningrad. This would normally have nothing to co with
military service, except that NOSENKO says he took the mili-
tary oath at the Baku School in the fall of 1943, at the
age of 16. (According to available collateral information,
the oath--ferm:! entcy into the military forces--was at no
time given before the age of 17, and never for purposes of
"show" or “morale” as NOSENKO claimed it was here.) He
clains to have deserted this school after taking the oath.

after starting anew later the same year in the naval school |

branch of the service he was in, except that it was not the :
navy. He avoided active military duty thereafter by volun-
tarily doing military translations at the Institute. thile
at the Institute he contracted venereal disease at least
twice and this went on his record.

- In the spring of 1950, he was assigned to the Navy
by a mandate commission at the Institute. However, he
failed one of his examinations ("Marxism-Leninism") upon
completicn of the Institute of International Relations later
in 1950 which Sglayed his ciploma--and hence entry into
the service--until successful re-examination later that
year. (At about the sane time, he was considered and turned
down by the KGB [then 4G3] because of his school record,
drunkenness, and. other bad marks in his record.)

- He was processed for entry into the naval GRU in
1950. He said he visited the GRU personnel cffice several
times for interviews and to fill out queetionnaires and
write his personal history in connection with the required
security check. He was accepted into naval GRU despite a

= He was called to active duty as a senior lieutenant
on 12 March 1951, and without any indoctrination cr train- {
ing, he departed four or five days later in civilian clothes
for his fiset duty station, Scvietskaya Gavan in the Soviet
Far East. NOSENKO claims to have chosen this post, con
sidered generally to be the least desirable of all naval
assignments, on his own initiative, to prove to his father
that ne wss a man, (The above was his account in 1966, in
all earlier accounts he seid he went to the Soviet Far East
in the fall of 1950, and in fact said that he had two months’
leave in 1952, one for each of two years there. However,
according to the 1956 account, his service there lasted only j
one year.)

- In fovetskaya Gavan KOSENKO's job was to extract in-
formation from American publications reporting naval de-
velopments, Asked in April 1964 for any personal account
of his own work, KOSEXKO was able to think of oniy “four or
five trips* on small ships to the coast of Sakhalin,* and
three to Hukxaido, to drop or pick up agents. His own role,
he said, was as a trainee; ne was taken along only “to learn
how it was done;" he himself never trained or dispatched any
agents, nor did he know the identities cr missions cf any
others. Hs also could not descrite the ships he had travelled
on. Questioned on the location of Sovetskaya Gavan’ in 1965,
NOSENKO insisted that this city is lecated in Primorskiy
Kray, although it is actually located in Khabarovskiy Kray.**

= NOSENKO said he returned on routine leave (or, accord-
ing to other accounts, because of having contracted tubercu-
losis) in April 1952. He then spent two months either in .
his parents’ Moscow home or, according to other accounts, in
a sanitorium near Moscow under treatment for tuberculosis.
He said he was coughing up “half a glass of dicod at a tine.”
(X-rays and medical exaninations from February 1964 have
detected ne indicaticns that NOSENKO ever suffered from
tuberculosis.)

via Naval Intelligence Points in Berlin, Rostock, and Sass-
nitz, but then said this was a lie he told because he felt
his interrogators would not believe him if ne had said he
successfully turned down an assignaent to these points,

then closing down, and had travelled directly to Baltiysk.

(As pointed out to NOSENKO, the assignment to the cold,

damp Baltic climate of a recent ~B-sufferer appears unthink-
able, particularly when that person is a Government Minister's
gon; he acknowiedged this but said, “There were no other
positions available.")

~ He could not remetber the nance of the place he served
near Raltiysk. He had named it as Primorsk in 1962 (which
fitted his description of its size and location) but from
1964 on insisted it was Sovetsk. There is no such village
in the area, but there is in the region a well-known city
by that name (the former Tilsit) far inland and far away.
He did not know (as contemporary Soviet maps show) that
a rail line went to Baltiysk from Primorsk.

- In the Baltiysk area, he claimed in 1962, he had
trained agent teams to be sent behind enemy lines in time of
war. Under interrogation in 1964 he changed his description
Of his functions, saying he merely prepared training mater
jals and delivered supplies, never having direct contact with
or knowledge of the agent work. His service there was
limited to about six months, since he said he left there at
the beginning of 1953. He either had had cne or two Leaves
from there, depending on which telling is accepted: In 1964
NOSENKO said that in August or September 1952 he was given
a special leave from his duties in Sovetsk to travel to Mos-
cow in order to formalize his divorce from his first wife;
in April 1966 he wrote that he was divorced during his leave
before going to Sovetsk.

~ NOSENKO said he returned to Moscow on his own initia-
tive and against the wishes of his commanding officer at the
end of 1952 and began steps to get out of the GRU. He has
told conflicting stories of where he stayed and in what
leave status. It was during this period, he said, that
his conversation with KOBULOV led him to shift to the KGB.

- In April 1966 NOSENKO wrote that he was promoted to
the rank of lieutenant of the Administrative Services while
stationed in Sovetsk. In earlier accounts he said that he
was promoted to the rank of lieutenant while stationed in
the Soviet Far East.

ec. Remarks

The notes above on NOSENKO's career do not treat most of the
changes of story, contradictions, corrections, or inaccuracies in
NOSENKO's accounts: Variations of dates may be attributable to
faulty memory, changes in the story might have resulted from his
own elaborations and exaggerations, and inaccuracies might be
explained by his inattention or indifference to detail. If all
the details were to be considered, the story would become even
more confused.

of an educated or reasonably intelligent person some recol-
lection of military service completed 10 years earlier--the
locations whece he served, whether he did or did not have
TB, how and when he entered or transferred from one place to
another, and what he did or what he experienced,

(3) NCSENKO's knowledge of military procedures, of
the navy, and of the units with which he eerved is practic-
ally non-exiztent. He has pro’ led no reason whatever to
make one believe that he actually wus a naval officer.

(4) The functions he claims to have fulfilled involved
no direst involvement or persona} responeibilities; They
sound like the bare outlines of a legend, not like real life
or personal experience.

That this period is fictitious is supported by the findings
of the psychologist (Pages 665-611).

NOSENKO's description of his naval GPU service cannot be
accepted as true. On the basis of his statements, it appears
moreover that he was never 2 naval officer, nor an officer of any
other regular military service.

Since NOSFNKO claims that his GRU status and service provided
him the platform fora transfer into the KGB’ (without such for-
malities as medical examination, personnel interviews or question-
naires), this conclusion is relevant to his claim of KGB staff
status from 1952 or 1553.

a. Bligibility

The previous section discussed NOSENKO's elig ity for
admission to the naval GRU and concluded with the remark that,
on the baeis of what NOSENKO has tc!d CIA ebout his earlier
life, he could not have been accepted for service in Naval
Intelligence. According to inforration available to CIA from
several knowledgeable sources, the GR has more stringent entry
requirements than any other Soviet organization. The candidate's
family background, personal conduct. and Party or Komsomol rec-
ord must be impeccable. NOSENKO would have Anerican Intelli-
gence believe that in his case the KGB--specifically the offi-
cers responsible for signing their names to the approval--accepted
a person whose record showed (as noted on pages 679-680 above)
desertion from the armed forces, self-inflicted wound in wartime,
drurkenncess, venereal disease, previous sarriage tc the daughter
oF-S state criminal, a bad aeaaonic record including Failure “of
ac course in-tareism-Leninism; and a prior rejection by ‘the KGB
itseliy ire unty thange"since’ the earlier” rejection had been, ~
according to NOSENKO, two years of undistinguished military ser-
vice in the Naval GRU. coe a

Moreover, during this naval duty NOSENKO said he had con~
tracted tuberculosis, for which he was still under treatment
at the €ime he entered the State Security Service. NOSENKO has
indicated on separate occasions tl his illness was a matter
ne reason he did not have to
take a physical examination for entry into the KGB was the avail~
ability of GRU records. According to DERYABIN, however, KGB
regulaticns at that time would have preciuded admission to KGB
ranks if there was a recent history of tuberculosis even though
already arrested.

b. Date of Entry it

NOSENKO has given a variety of dates for his entry on duty
with the KGB and has provided severa! reasons for his changes of
story (Pages 36-89). During his first zeeting with CIA, when
NOSENKO gave a brief personal ané proZessional autobiography, he
said that he had joined the KGB in February or March 1953. In
1964, however, first while still ettached to the Soviet Disarma-
ment Delegation and later when reviewing and signing a bio-
graphic history prepared by CIA on the dasis of his own account,
NOSENKO set this date back a year, to early 1952. During the
interrogations of April 1964, after naming several other dates,
NOSENKO returned to the original one, March 1953, and has remained
with this version since that time. NOSENKO has given two dif~
ferent reasons for this change of dates (which, he said in Octo~
ber 1966, was conscious deception). In the April 1964 interrogations,
he explained that he had failed his examination in Marxism-Leninism
at the Institute of International Affairs, which forced hia to
take all his exams over again and delayed his cereer: This was
*unpleasant,* NOSENKO said, and he was attempting to conceal it
from CIA. In the October 1966 interrogations, NOSENKO gave a new
and different reason. He described how he had been rejected for
employment by State Security while at the Institute and was trying
to cover up for this because he thought CIA would not believe
that he had first been rejected and then, later, accepted by the KGB.

NOSENKO's change of story took place in 1964 while still in the
relatively relaxed circumstances of an operational meeting in
Geneva; he came back to his original account only during the

further inconsistencies. Because of this and, in the absence of
any pressure of any kind (including any apparent psychological 7
pressure) to lie about his date of entry, the most logical explana~

tion for this change is that NOSENKO forgot in early 1364 either :
when ke joined the KGB and/or what he had told CIA in 1952.

DERYABIN has commented on the significance which the date of entry

holds for a KGB officer. tie expressed the opinion that it would

be unusual for a KGB officer to forget this date.

concerning the t:zing of his entry on duty with the KG2. As a
result of this interrogation it was determined that NOSENKO was
unaware that at the timo he said he j ed the KGB, the present
First Chief Directorate was designated the Second Chief Direc-
torate and vice versa. Therefore, NOSENSO would have joined a
component entitled the First Chief Directorate in March 1953,
not the Second Chief Directorate as he says. NOSENKO did not
know or had forgotten various other facts, including the date
that the MVD was redesignated the KCB, and misstated the loca-
tions and existence of various buiidings and offices in the
vicinity of the KGB Headquarters building in early 1953. :

NOSEXKO was questioned at length by DERYABIN (Pages 616-619) |
I

Ir, June 1962 NOSENKO said several times, in different meet~
ings, that the KGB agent “ANDREY" (Pages 413-414) had been re-
cruited and had left Moscow before he, SENKO, entered the KGB.
He estimated the date as 1949-1950. NOSENKO knew that “ANDPEY®
was associated in Moscow with RNODES and when told that RHODES
was there from 1951 to 1953, admitted that the date he gave might
be wrong. NOSENKO continued to say, however, that “ANDREY" was
recruited before he (NOSELKO) became a K38 officer, and later

: reverted again to his estimate that "ANDRE." was recruited in
1949-1950, Wher he returned to Geneva in 1964, NOSENKO changed :
this story and said that during has 1953-1955 tour in the U.S. i
Embassy Section he saw cipher specialist SELEZNOV, who had come
there to consult on the then-active "ANDREY" case. NOSENKO was
unable to explain how he could have been sure in 1962 that the
"ANDREY® case was before nis time) when ne said in 1964 that
this was not so. Dayle SMITH confessed that he was recruited by
the KGB in late 1953, and records show that he left Moscow in

early 1954.
ec. Circurstances of Entry

NOSENKO has consistently related his entrance into the KGB

7 to discussions he had with General KOBULOV in early 1953 in Mcs~
cow, after returning from the Baltic. However, he has changed the
date of these discussions with KOBULOV virtually every time he
has told this story. In June 1962, NOSENKO said he talked with {
KOBULOV at the NOSENKO dacha while on leave in March 1953; during

the April 1964 interrogations he changed the date to February |
1953; in April’ 1965 KOSENKO said he spoke to KOBULOV at the '
KOBULOV dacha in January 1953 while on leave and that he lived : i
at home and was at the “disposal of GRU personnel” during Febru-
ary and March. Finally, in April 1966, NOSENKO said he first
spoke to KOBULOV at KOBULOV's dacha on New Years Day 1953, that ‘
he was subsequently "resting" at a sanitorium connected with his |
tuberculosis of the year befure, and that he spoke again to 7 !
KOBULOV cr. the day of STALIN's funeral, while home for a few days j
from the sanitorium, It was at this second encounter with KOBULOV
that the latter promised to concern himself with NOSENKO's entry . |
into the KGB.

ive SECRET, =



yor

In 1962 NOSENKO described the simple procedure by which he
entered the KG3, volunteering that there was no need to fill out
a questionnaire (anketa) as the KGB already had his files from
the GRU. In Apri when asked if he had not been required
to fill out any questionnaires or other documents, NOSENKO ces-
eribed the anketa and other forss he completed (saying he took
them home to do s0) and his various interviews with KGB per~
sonnel officers. He was interrogated in detail on these claims
by DERYABIN in 1965, to whom he gave descriptions, albeit in-
accurate, of the varicus forms and of his visits to KGB Personnel.
In 1966 NCSENKO wrote in his autobiography that there were no
talks with KGB Personnel before or after his acceptance and in-
plied that there were no forms to fill out.

da. Remarks

According to all of NOSENKO's stories, his GRU service was
the springboard for his acceptance into the KGB. He met KOBULOV
while hore in Moscow from Primorsk/Sovetsk, he entered the KGB
as a lieutenant since this was his naval rank, his admission
according to the early version was facilitated by the availability
of his GRU personnel file; yet CIA has concluded that NOSENKO
was never a GRU officer and it appears highly improbable that he
waa ever in Primorsk under any circumstances.

On the basis of generally available information concerning
Sovict realities at the time of NOSENKO's claimed entry into the
¥GB, supported by the expert testimony of DERYABIN (who was in
the KGB, then MVD, in Moscow at the time and hed been himself a
KGB personnel officer until less than a year earlier), a person
with the background NOSENKO has given could not be accepted into
the KGB in the manner he claims. lis health alone would seem
to have precluded this, but in addition, NOSENKO described a
series of incidents in his life equally likely to cause rejection.
NOSENKO's mistakes, changes of story, and apparent fabrications
add to the unlikelihood of his account.

It is concluded that, as in the case of NOSENKO's GRU ser~
vice, either NOSENKO and those who have supported aspects of
his story have seriously distorted his past life, or he did not

enter the KGB.

4. Initial Service in the U.S. Embassy Section

a. Introduction

NOSENKO claims to have served in the U.S. Fnbassy Section of
the American Department, Second Chief Directorate, curing the
period-from his entry on duty with the KGB until June 1955. His
targets during these two years were at first American correspond-
ents in Moscow and later American Aray Attaches at the Fmbassy.

NOSENKO sought to avoid discussion cf his ownlor-other KGB
activity dering this period and on occasion he has ‘tried to dis-
miss the whole period as “not relevant" and “cf no consequence.”
NOSENKO has repeatedly said that he “found himself" only after his
{nitial service in the U.S. Embassy Section, (He varicusly dated
his self-discovery as occurring in 1955, when he transterred to
the Tourist Department; in June 1956, in connection with his par-
ticipation in and awara for the BURGI case; and after Acgtst 1956,
when the death of his father forced him to puil himseii together.)
Before this, KOSENKO said, he was a wastrel and “did not pay
attention to the work."

b. Work Against American Correspondents

NOSENKO exempted himself from reporting details of KGB work
against any specific American correspondent in Moscow in 1953-
1954 (Pages 93-96) by saying that, as a new, very junior employee
he had no access to operaticnal files and did not participate
personally in the handling of any of the currespondents. Although
able to icentify four correspondents in Moscow who were then re-
cruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this infermation either in
conversations with his superior KOZLOV or at some point and in
some undefined way after he no longer was working against these
targets. NOSENKO's early months in the job were spent reading
personality (not operational) files on a number of the corres~
pondents in Moscow (none of which indicated the individual's de-~
velopmental or agent status) and familiarizing himself with KGB
methods. Later NOSENKO was assigned the “agent network" of
drivers, clerical personnel, and domestics surrounding four. of
the correspondents (two of whom were recruited ¥G5 agents at
the time); he met with them periodicaily to determine whether
they had. devaloped any important information. Even here, however,
NOSENKO appears to have been given very little responsibility:

His superior KOZLOV often went alcng to the meetings with NCSENKO,
first to show him how to handle the agents and afterward when-
ever something interesting would begin to develop. In fact,
according to NOSENKO, KOZLOV would accompany him to meetings

with these Soviet citizens-agents even when there was a “hint”
that something of interest might develop. NOSENKO has been able
to identify some of these agents, but for all but a few he re-
called neither their names nor personalia concerning then.

ce. Work Against Army Attaches

Regarding NOSENKO's work against American Army Attaches, he
claimed a specific area of KGB responsibility, one for which he
alone was accountable and one about which something was previously
known from U.S. records. Only 20 months at the longest, it is

i
|
i



ieee
687. L ealarle

the last period in which NOSENKO had no supervisory responsibility
to divert his attention from personal operational duties.

NOSENKO could not remember when he toux over responsibility
for the Army Attsches, and he named two other KGB officers before
settling upon BUDYLDIN as the person from whon he received the
Attaches' files. When belittling his earlier responsibilities
for correspondents, he has said several times that he had heen in
that job “only about six months." Assuming that NOSENKO entered
the KGB in the middie of March 1953, this would date his transfer
to work against the Attaches in the fall of that year. In dis-
cussing this transfer itself, however, NOSENKO has consistently
id that it took place in 1954. Asked when in 1954, NOSENKO
bas variously replied "at the beginning of 1954," January 1954,
and Mey 1954. Under interrogation in early 1965, NOSENKO re-
fused to estimate when he took over this responsibility. He has
always eaid that he turned over these duties and transferred from
the U.S. Embassy Section in June 1955, when the Tourist Department
was established within the Second Chief Directorate. :

NOSENKO has said in different contexts that as the American
Department case officer responsible for cperations against the
U.S. Army Attaches he received and‘was responsible for assinilat-
ing the product of a wide variety of gources on the individuals
who were his targets. Ne has mentioned information received from
the KGB First Chief (Foreign Intelligence) Directorate; the
Archives of the MGB/MVD/KGB; micropiones which were eaplaced
about a year before NOSENKO entered the American Department*; a
network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors, and
other agents in the Enbassy who together provided little useful
information; permanent and roving surveillance patrois outside
the Embassy; fixed observation posts next to, across from and
near the Embassy; advance notification of intent to travel by
the Attaches and their itjneraries; and reports from outside Yos-
cow, including surveillance, egent networks, the Militia, and the
military. The point of collecting and assimilating this infor-
mation, NOSENKO said, was to be able to know what the Attaches
were doing in Moscow ard thereby to control their intelligence
collection activities. Far less important was the goal of re-
cruiting Military Attaches; NOSENKO knew of only several in-
stances when this was attempted, and all of these efforts failed.

The KGB's principal interest in control rather than recruit~
went has been NOSENKO's explanation for knowing little about the
backgrounds ard personal lives of his targets--such information,
he stated, simply was not pertinent to the primary mission of

*On some occasions NOSEXKO has said that the microphones in the
Aray Attache offices were his most valuable source of informa-
tion on his targets of 1954-1955; at other times he has said

that he knew nothing of these microphones until he reentered the
U.S. Embassy Section in 1960; and at still other times he claimed
to have known only of their existence during 1953-1955 but not
where any were located.

control.* He has also used this*exptanatica to support his claim
that there were no recruitments of military attaches during this
period. :

An exception, wherein the KGB did carefully compile a great
deal of vulnerability data on an Army Attache, bas described by
NOSENXO in connection with the approach to Walter MULE (Page 104).
On the basis of these cxpianations, NOSENKO's knowledge of the
of ial and unofficial activities of his alleged targets in this
period deserves attention.

NOSENKO knew almost nothing about the personal backgrounds
and families of the Gight members of the Arny Attache Office
whom he identified as his targets (Pages 99-106). Although he was
able to identify each by rank and position in the "nbassy-~some-
times inaccurately--and in a few cases to Gescribe certain cf
their operaticnal activities, he was unaware of or had forgotten

such facts as:

= Colonel Earl L. MICKELSCN, the Army Attache in 19534

and 1955, was arrested twice Ly the Militia outsice of Mos-
cow in 1954.

= Assistant Army Attache Ira RICHARDS was a language
student of GROMOKOVA (identified by NOSENKO as a KGB egent);
by RICHARDS' account she sought to elicit biographic data
from him during the lessons.

= William STROUD, the Assistant Amy Attache, travelled
to Kharkov in May 1955 to interivew an American defector.
(HOSENKO has identified Frank SISCOE, who accompanied STROUD,
as a suspected CIA officer; he was coopted by CIA.)

NOSENKO, furthermore, was ignorant of important events, known
independently to CIA, which were within the sphere of what he
claimed was his direct, personal responsibility:

= NOSENKO claimed direct personal fesponsibility for
the file of and operational activity against Lieutenant
Colonel Howard FELCHLIN (Pages 191-103). He claimed to be
receiving agent information on him but could not recall the
names or cryptonyms of any such agents. (ie said, for
exarple: "I think FELCHLIN must have had a maid, and she
would have been a GB agent.") NOSENKO describec FELCHLIN
as by far the most aggressive of his targets and hence the
object of special interest; yet he did not know or remember

¥—HOSERNKO himself, when giving the reason why he did not know
more details about the U.S. Embassy Section's targets while
he was its Deputy Chief in 19€0-1961, said that as a supervisor
he was too busy overseeing subordinates; hence,.NOSENKO con~
tinued, he could not be expected to remember as many such de~
tails as would be possible had he been a case officer working
daily with only four or five files. In another context, NOSENKO
explained why he was unable to supply the details of planning
and organizing operations against tourists in the period 1955~
1959; he contrasted operations against tourists, who often
came and went in a matter of a few days, to the work against
the Military Attaches and diplomats stationed in Moscow on
permanent assignments, who could be studied systematically and

slowly.

anything about FELCILIN's background, presutably well docu-
mented by the KGB because FELCHLIN had been to the USSR in
two different capacities, merchant seaman and diplomatic
courier, prior to arriving in Moscow as the Assistant Army
Attache; also FELCHLIN had had prior official association
with GRU officers in Austria, Germany, and the United States,
and he continued to be in liaison with one of them in Moscow,
NOSENKO could recall nothing about FELCHLIN's intelligence
activities in the USSR or his trips about the country, or
what had been done atout them by the KGB. In speaking of
FELCHLIN's expulsion from the Soviet Union, NOSENKO reported
the KGB file noted that FELCHLIN had been caught taking
photographs on some occasion, but he did not know that FEL~
CHLIN in June 1954 was arrested in Kiev with another Assist~-
ant Army Attache, F.J. YEAGER. (Erroneously identified by
NOSENKO as an Air Force Attache, YEAGER likewise should have
been NCSENKO's target.) NOSENKO also did not know that
FELCHLIN, with another Army Attacne and two Air.Force Attaches,
in September 1953 had made an unprecedented train trip through-
out Siberia and that six months later, ac the end of March
1954, had been the subject of a newspaper article which
charged that they had lost “spy documents" on the train.
NOSENKO was unable to provide a date for PELCHLIN's expul-
sion from the Soviet Union, and he new nothing of the un-
usual circumstances cf FELCHLIN's Cceparture from Moscow;
he insisted that nobody else was declared persona non grata
along with FELCHLIN, In fact, FELCHLIN was Seceried along
with Air Force Major walter McXINNEY, and the Soviets re-
fused to permit the two to leave Moscow aboard the Ambassa~
dor's personal plane until Ambassador BOHLEN himself protested.
Confronted by his lack of knowledge of the persona non

rata action, NOSENKO said that he could not be expected to
how the details because this incident occurred after he
transferred from the U.S. Embassy Section to the Tourist
Department in June 1955, NOSENKO was then told the recorded
date of the expulsion, 3 July 1954, and he replied that this
was not true.

- Discrepancies appeared in NOSENKO's account of one
of the best known incidents in the history of KGB operations
against the American officials in the Soviet Union, the
subject of reports by GOLITSYN and other CIA sources and the
subject of training zaterials. This was the seizure of
sensitive technical collection equipment on 5 May 1955 in
Stalingrad from three Assistant Military Attaches from the
U.S. Embassy--Major John S. BENSON, Captain STROUD, and :
Captain MULE--and their expulsion from tne Soviet Union two
days later. NOSENKO claimed direct responsibility for KGB
work against these officers (Pages 103-105); he described
an earlier attempt to defect MULE, his own plans for seizing
this equipment at 4 railroad station outside Moscow, and his
role in developing plans for the successful operation in
Stalingrad. when NOSENKO was pressed under interrogation to
give the entire story of the equipment seizure~and the persona
non grata action, he said that the operation was carried out
after he was in the Tourist Department and therefore he knew
no more about it. then told that the operation took place
at least a month before his alleged transfer, NOSENKO could
offer no explanation for his lack of knowledge.

= NOSENKO identified George VAN LAETHEM as an Assistant

Mir Attache 1n 1953 or 1954: he was a target of another U.S. ,
Embassy Section officer, and an unsuccessful KGB development ~
operation was carried out against him. NOSENKO did not krow |
that VAN LASTHEM was actually an Assistant Army Attache, who
left Moscow in March 1953 and was succeeded by NOSENKO's own |
target Walter MULE (see above). What NCSENKO additionally
did not know is that in Moscow VAN LAETHEM was the Attache
cryptographic security officer, the superior of Dayle SMITH
(the subject of NOSE:KO's “ANDREY" lead--see below) and a
friend of the motor pool sergeant Roy RHCDES, a KGB agent.
NOSENKO furthermore did not know that on 19 March 1955,
again as en Army Attache, and only two years after being
transferred from Moscow, VAN LAETHEM-was again sent to Mos-
cow, ostensibly on a PCS assignment but actually on tempor-
ary duty. During this latter assignment, when NOSENKO by
his own account should have been responsible for him, VAN

: LAZTHEM was in Mo. w to review th: entire electronics
program at the E sy. (VAN LAETHEM's second tour in

‘ Moscow invelved e planned use of the electronic equipment.

: which was seized in Stalingrad while VAN LAETHEM was still ~

in Moscow.) . ait

d. Additional Reporting ae

His information on two other operations involving Americans
was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in the U.S.
Embassy Section. One was the recruitment of the military cipher
machine mechanic having the KGB cryptonym “ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH,
see Pages 413-426 and further comments in Part VIII.B.3, and
VIII.C.). NOSENKO in 1962 was sure not only thet this recruit-
ment tock place before he joined the KGB but that "ANDREY" had
left the USSR by then as well: he repeatedly estimated “ANDREY's"
recruitment date as "1949-1950," At all times he has claimed
certainty that “ANDREY" wes the last KGB recruitment in the
Embassy until the time of NOSENKO's defection in January 1964.
In 1964, however, NOSE:.KO changed his story and said "“ANDREY"
was active while NOSENKO was in the U.S. Embassy Section ii. 1954-
1955. The other operation was an unsuccessful recruitment approach
to the U.S. Embassy Security Officer Edward Ellis SMITH (see
Pages 468-469 and further comments in Part VITI.B.3. and VIII.C.
above) at a meeting with the KGB arranged through letters which
t : jhad been sent to SMITH. This occurred in 1954 or 1955, NOSENKO

said, and in support of the recruitment approach, he handled

: the surveillance phone-watch, SMITH admitted to U.S. authorities
a having received four letters from the KGB between 2 and 5 June
1956 (a year after NOSENKO dated his departure from the U.S.
Embassy Section), but he denied having had any personal meetings
with KGB officers.

e. Remarks

NOSENKO's accounts of the 1953-1955 period are confused,
contradictory, and, when compared with collateral information,
incomplete and inaccurate. He has been inconsistent in dating
his shift of responsibilities within the U.S, Embassy Section,
in dating his departure from the Section (vaz., the timing of | if

the Stalingrad incident and the approach to SMITH), and in dating
his first knowledge of the microphones in the Embassy. Having ~

TOP SECRET :

few new details of importance on the American correspondents,
NOSENKO has proven unreliable regarding his work against Army
Attaches: He misidentified two (YEAGER and VAN LAETHEM), he
claimed to have almost no information on the backgrounds and acti-
vities of the others; and he lacked even.the most important de-
tails on security affairs involving the majority of his eight
alleged targets. In addition, NOSENKO has told CIA almost noth-
ing about the work of his colleagues in the U.S, Embassy Section,

The statements by NOSENKO about this period therefore hold
so little substance and the manner of his reporting was so uncon-
vincing, that his claim to have been an officer of the U.S.
Embassy Section in the years 1953-1955 cannot be true.

a. Introduction

NOSENKO's activities from June 1955 to January 19€6, his
first period of alleged service with the Aserican-British-Canale
dan Section of Tourist Department of the KGB Second Chief Direc-
torate, are descrited in Pages 107-151. For the purjoses of the
following diecussion, it is ccuvenient to divide this period into
two parts. The firse uf these covers the years from June 1955
to June 1958, when NOSENKO said ke was a staff case officer,
handling and recruiting agents and planning ard naging opera-
ticnal activity, The second part covers NOSENKO's service froin
June 1953 to the beginning of 1960 as Lepu:y Chie! of this section.
Apart from his personal involvement in a nurter of recruitment
operations in the latter pericd, it is this servic
@ basis for NOSENKO to Claim awareness of 411 import
of spies and recruitments from tourists visiting
the Soviet Unicn; it is elso t puty Chief cf Sec-
tion which NOCENKO cites as a involvement in the
case of Lee Harvey OSWALD ainsi the Soviet Union.

b. The Early Pe
(i) General

nd (1955 to 1953)

Recording to NOSE'NXO's story, he ng the fizst case
efficers in the Tourist Department. He arrived there just as
the Department was beiry formed and took part with other officers
assioned in the acquisition of an agent network from within
Inmturist, in the establishment of facilities and methods, and in
Senerally “getting things going." Several montns later he parti-
cipated in what he says was his first operation against an Ameri-
can tourist. ‘his was NOSENKO's Lehind-the-scenes (and hence
unconfirmed) organization of an urseccussful attempt to compromise
Martin MALIA (Pages 112-113). NOSENKO's next case (the first
‘operation in which his participation is confirmed) took place a
wear later, in June 1955, when he assisted in the homosexual en-
txapment and recruitment of Richard BURGI (Pages 113-120).
recruitment, which cccurred close in time to the Minister NOS.
death, was by NOSENKO's account a turning point in his personal
and professional life. itn it, NOSENKO began to acquire a sense
of self-confidence and responsibility and began to “grow" from a
wastrel into an effective and successful KGB officer. As a re-
sult of this operation, the first successful recruitment in the
then short history of the Tourist Department, NOSENKO first cane
inte personal contact with Gencral GRIBANOY. According to ali
accounts prior to October 1966, when he retracted the claim,
NOSEKKO received the first of a series of KGS awards for opera-
tional performance because of the BUIGI case--a letter of con-
mendgation. Within a month of this oreration, NOSENYO said, he
was promcted from the rank of lieutenant to captain, his last
pronotion prior to defecting eight years later.

personally spoke to him, NOScNKO explained his (unconfirred)
participation in this case, which was not among the responsibili-
ties of his section, -hv-cavina there was no ¥G8 cfticer available
who spoke German put ma little Eng-
lis 2 language in whica HOSENKO hed fair fluency. In 1957
NOSENKO was also involved in the sexval and bleckmarket entrap~
rent of G@SSEOER Norwegian journalist (again, not a target of
KOSENKO's section, being neither American, Lritish or Canadfan):
NOSESKO has rot explained how he cave to be involved in this
operation, but he said his role was that of invclving Evith
wonen and pene ee so that anothere officer, ARKHIPOV, could

recruit hin. as rot identifiec NOSEVKO, but reported on
an individval whose role corresponds to the one NOSENXO claimed
as his own (Pages 121-122). NOSENZO's third operaticn in 1957
was really not an ration at all. he was assigned to accompany
the British QgRimeweGeeweend the latter's interpreter GawzHon
a tcur of Soviet publishing houses (Pagz 121). NOSENKO said his
purpose was only to watch QMBY% s suspected intelligence agent
or officer. lis presence was confirred by ERR who recognized
NOSENKO's photograph.

This is the sum cf NOSENKO's ‘Yeported, ecretimes verified,
operational role during the three Years preceding ie promotion
in June 1958 to the position of LCeputy Chief of the Anerican-
Canadian-British Tourist Section, hereafter referred to as the
American Tcurist Section. i

The onty case of the June 1955-Ju: 1958 period resulting
in agent contacts abroad, and the to which NCSENKO ascribed
the greatest importance, was the recruitment 1f 8URGI. For this
reason, the BUPGI operation is discussed in detail below, with
particular attention being given to those aspects of the case
which reflect upcn NOSENKO's own personal role. Ee

(ii) The BURGI Case

NOSENKO's statements of this operation generally agreed with
that BURGI provided to the F831 in 1957. The part NOSENKO played
in the case, both in his brief initial presence with the two
homosexuals in the Moscow restaurant cn the evening of BURGI's
compromise (20 June 1356) and in the fiev events (23-28 June 1956)
would appear to be one normally taken by a KGB staff officer.

The identities of the other two KG participants in the Kiev
recruitment, KOZLOV and PETRENKO, seem clearly established. There
were discrepancies between NOSENKO's and BURGi’s versions, but
most of these could stem from NOSENXO's faulty nerory nine years
after the events. (Such discrepancies include "US=INKO's iailure
to remember his first Moscow meetings with BURGI: the identity,
role, or even existence of the person “Anatoliy” whom BURGI says
introduced him to NOSENKO and participated in the homosexual
compromise; whether NOSENKO was at the Kiev airport to meet BURGI;
the locaticna of NOSENKO's bedroom in the Ki Hotel as compared
to BURGI's; NOSENKO'’s reference to BURGI"s “interpreter" when in
fact EBURGI neither had nor needed one; and NOSENKO's failure to
remember the unusual circumstances of BURGI's departure from
Kiev.) Other contradictions and omissions in NOSENKO's reporting
relate to matters of greater operational consequence:

~ NOSENKO was unable to say when or how the KGS first
learned that BURGI was a homosexual, nor could he remember
who first proposed an cperation against him. t

+ NOSENKO gave a confused and evasive account of his
dealings with the Pirst Chief Directorate on this case.

~ FOSENKO insisted that there was no official file on
BURGI, and that none was opened as a result of this opera-
tion. The initiative for the operation came, he said, from
the Second Chief Directorate, and when NCSENKO traced BURGI
in the First Chief Directorate, there was no information on
him there.* The KGB's only information on BURGI at the
time of the compromise came from BURGI's visa application '
(which showed him to be a professor of Russian) and a few °
agent reports from the preceding days in Moscow: BURGI,
on the other hand, reportec that during the recruitment:
KOZLOV, the senior Soviet present, showed knowledge of the
Names of BURGI's sister, mother and father and knew the
sister's occupation; details of BURGI's background, work, and
military service, BURG!‘s relations with the Russicum in
Pome, which BURGI said he had never mentioned in the USSR;
and BURGI*s acquaintance in the U.S. with Alexander KERENSKY.

NOSENKO cited “his" recruitment of BURGI in Kiev in 1956 as

one of the main reasons for his repid rise in the KGB, BURGI's >
story of the recruitment, as reported to the FBI, definitely
establishes NOSENKO's role as having been subordinate to that of
KOZLCV-~-it was KOZLOV, not NOSENKO, who made the recruitment.

DERYABIN interrogated NOSENKO on this case. NOSENKO's answers

to such detailed questions as how the traces were done, how
the travel to Kiev was arranged, details concerning the person-
nel involved, the contents of the file, and other mechanics

of the case, betrayed an almost total lack of memory.

¢. Promotion to Deputy Chief of Section

NOSENKO said that in June 1958, when the unit that had
formerly handled tourists from all countries was reorganized into
two sections, he was promoted from the rank of senior case offi-
cer to that of Deputy Chief of the newly created American Tourist
Section. NOSENKO said that this section was the most inportant
in the Tourist Department, and that he did not know why he,
in particular, had been chosen its Deputy Chief but was certain
that GRIBANOV had no voice in the decision.

d. Knowledge of Section’s Staff and Agent Personnel

NOSENKO has named with clarity and consistency the other
officers of the American Tourist Section during this period. The
Soviet agents of his section whem NOSENKO has identified were
mostly his own; he said that the agents were constantly shifted
from case officer to case officer end hence it was “difficult to
say just who handled which agents." NOSENKO said he had approxi~
mately eight Soviet agents in 1958 ard about 12 or 14 in 1959, 7
most of them employed by Inturist (Pages 109-112). With the ex~
ception of the two homosexuals, YEFFENOV and VOLKOV. discussed
separately below, NOSENKO cannot supply personal cata on his own
agents or remember specific jobs they did for the KGB.

e. Knewledge of Section's Activi 5

As of June 1958, according to NCSENKO, the work of the
section of which he was deputy chief was “just getting going.”
Its mission was, first of ail, to detect Western Intelligence
officers and agents among the increasing flow of tourists visit-
ing the Soviet Union; only secondarily was the section directed
toward the recruitment of KGB agents from among these tourists.
In his new positicn NOSENKO was responsible for supervising
other officers in the section in efforts along these lines. Be-
cause of this and because at GRISANOV’s request ne personally
reviewed KGB information on the use of tourist cover by Western
intelligence services and KGB counteraction threugh 1958 (Pages

*145-146), NOSENKO made a number of statements concerning these

subjects during the 1955-1959 period.

over, thanks to collateral holdings, what NOSENKO did and did not
know can be compared with information from other sources. These
facts are reviewed below.

(i) BLAKE

A valuable source of information for the KGB in its planning
for the operational activity of its Tourist Mepartment in the
late 1950's and early 1960's was the Englishman, George BLAKE
(Pages 146-147). BLAKE ‘has confessed that in the summer of 1959
he passed the, KGB a 19-page summary of the results of a three-day
meeting during the first week of June 1959, between represent.

While NOSENKO has displayed some Familiarity| ]
a he has never men-
tioned that the KGB was in possession of documentary reporting
which described these methods in full detail. NOSENKO does

not appeer to be aware of who BLAKE was, much less of his im-
portance to the KGE. NOSENKO never volunteered the name of
BLAKE in his Gebriefings, and when specifically asked in i962
about BLAKE, the KGB agent in Britisn Intelligence, he said

that he had read the dossier and thet BLAKE had been “an pind

he replied that none had and that he knew of no agent who could
have provided such documentary information.

of his defection in December 1961 took with him an official
top secret KGB documert/ |

did not mention this fact in the June 1962 meetings. Although
NOSENKO also stated that this document had been prepared by
the Tourist Departm , he has net been able to cescribe the
document in detail and specifically did not mention that this

_ particular document was in large part based, as subsequent
analysis has shown, upon the above-mentioned reports submitted
to the KGB by George BLAKE,

coincide with the time when NOSENKO claims to have been Deputy

% g. The OSWALD Case i
g {

According to NOSENKO's account of his direct involvement
in the case of Lee Harvey CSWALD (Pages 136-144), his partici-
. pation seemed to stem solely from his supervisory role as
Deputy Chief of the American Secticn, In this capacity, NOSENKO
i said, he was the cne who made the cecision that OSWALD was
*not normal" and of no interest to the KGB. On other occasions
NOSENKO has reported that he made this decision together with
: his subordinate KRUPNOV, or that “they decided,” or “it was
1 decided." NOSENKO'’s information on the handling of OSWALD in
' 1959 is unique, and there is no collateral information against
which it can be reliably measured. The results of the poly-
graph examination in October 1966, hcwever, indicated that
NOSENKO lied in having said that he was persorally connected

(i) General

NOSENKG appeared in one ogeraticn snortly afte: being pro-
moted to the position of Deputy Cnief, the reeru: mt of the
American woman HAPRIS in September 1963 on the b..sis of har
romantic involvement with a Soviet male. HARRIS tentatively
identified NOSENKG's photograph as thet of one of ‘wo Soviets
who approached her in Moscow and said that, of the two, he was
“gefinitely the ran in charge.” She denied having had fu
contacts with the KG3 after leaving the Soviet Union. In
BKOSENKO taid, he also supervised the sexual entrapment of
but did not becoze personally involvei the opproach, which
was trade by his superior DUVAS. Scene time during this year,
NOSENKO said, he recruited the second of his pair of
agents, YEFSEM0V. Beginning in the sr
two in a series cf success recruitzent approac Lo Se

as a comercial representat ‘EEA in Moscow, was not the
reeponsibility cf NOS "s section, 89: O was asred to make
the appreach because he was a “specialist” in this type of
operation.) In 1959 NOSENKO aiso use? these agents in opera
tions against to Anerican guides at the sSokoin Exhibit,
BRARETT and WILLERFORD. Finally, NOSENXO said, in 1959 he
accomplished the recruitment of the Averican Express Compary
representative in Moscow, FRIPPEL,on the basis of sexual coa-
promise.

+
(ii) The Homosexuals YEFREMOV aac VOLYOV

There is a preponderance of homosexual recruitment opera-
tions in NOSENKO's account cf his KG3 carcer. o has referred
to several homosexual agents with when he has “orked on spe~
cific recruitrent-entra t seid that he ain-
self was never their cff al case officer. They include
“LUCH," "STROYEV," “NIKOLAYEV," "S13. AK" and KCSHKT

personality inforraticn about thea. He identified caly VOLKOV
‘and YEPREMOV as his own agents.

them frequenily, directing them in at least a zen entrapment

(but used them in no operations during 1960 and 1961) and back
again in early 1962 to the Tourist Department (where they were
used only cnce, immediately after his return). He gave a rela-
tively clear account of the recruitment (Pages 107-108), bat:

- He has never been able to remember YEFREMOV'S
patronyn.

of Moscow residence, family circumstances, job details,

they had met BARRETT again in 1961, st ortly before BARRETT i
was recruited on the basisof the 195% compromise. Hy

~ He did nct know details of why or hew VCLKOV and
YEPREMOV first cane into contact with their most recent
target, W.E. JOHNSCN, nor how they set up the compromise
which led to NOSENKO's entry a8 a police officia under
the name Yuriy Ivanovich NiXOLAYEV (Pages 289-293). H

(iii) Homosexual Entrapre: t Operations

buring 1959 NGSENKO said he made recruitment approaches
to five U.S. end British citizens cn the pasis of homosexual
entrapment operaticns involving the agents YEFREMOV and VOLKOV.
All five approaches were successful, and the four Westerners
who have row been identified have, in tur identified NOSENKO
in one way or another as the recruiting officer, With the ex-
ception of the FRiPPEL case and the homosexual compromise of
BARRETT and WILLORFCRD. (which did not result in approaches dur-
ing NOSENKO's tour in the American Tourist Section), these were
the only operations in which Nos 0 tock part in 1959 and
they represented, in fact, the c: recruitments by the section
during this year, NOSEW&O said. He claimed repeacedly in 1962,
1964, and 1965 that at the erd of 1959 he received a cornends~ H
tion from the KGB Chairaan for his recruitment of the five homo~
gexuals and FRIPPEL (| iscusse? separateiy below). In October

: 1966, he admitted that this claim was untrue.

} In discussing the GEMM case (Pages 123-124) NOSENKO had :
: forgotten details which, irc his confirmed participation, he
certainly once knew. He sai that (as with the BLP case-~
see below) another case officer (IVANOV) hed the file materials
on the target before he did, N2SENKO stated that his agents
i -VOLKOV, and YEFRENOY reported to NOSENKO in Mosccw on
4 homosexuality and then “IVANOV and I and pessibly GUSKCV, the
i . Section Chief, reported this to DUBAS,” Chief of the Tourist
Department. NOSENKO couid rot resember the arrangements for
taking the pictures, nor in what Moscow hotel the photography
took place. When nt to Leningrad, NOSENKO wa3 sent
there to approach , flying alcne (as in the EE case).
All Leningrad arrangements were made by the local kG3- Asked
why he was assigned to the case, NOSENKO replied: "I was told
to go." Asked why IVANOV could not handle it, he answered:
“He was not considered capable,” his English was "not bad but
he didn't have enough operational experience." NOSENKO did
not remember who wrote the reqzest for permission to make the |

whether EPawas staying in the hotel where the Leningrad come
promice and approach took place. He nomed the Iwningrad case
officer, FERELETCV, but said that he, XOSENKO, made the re-
cruitment ELT #0id another man was present, .

NOSENKO's account in general matches statements
on this appreach (Pages 125-126). The disc acies, as well
as the omissions in the former's statements and his uncertainty
of the facts, may be attributable to faulty memory on the part
of NOSFNKO. Although os O was at this time Deputy Section
Chief, when asked to explain his own selection as recruiting
officer, he said that he did net know why “they” chose him
and, when pressed as to who selected hit, said "CUBAS, I think.*
when asked why the case officer VETLITSKIY, who originally had
the materials cn could not do *he jek, he answered:

*"Y don't know." NOSENKU claims that he himself arranged the
transfer of a KG3 “agent or operational contact” (he did not
remember which} to Uzhgorod from Odessa for this case, and
said he did this only by phone calls, with nothing written,

He gave a physica! cescription hut had no cther knowledge of
this agent, neither name nor code name nor job nor background
nor KGB status ("I wasn't interested"). The agent, he said,
travelled alone} NOSENKC did not arrange to receive him in
Uzhgorod because the local KGB took care of everything. NOSENKO
met him only once, and th in the company of a case officer
of the Uzhgorod KGB, whose name or other data he has also for-
gotten. KOSENKO said he did not report to Moscow about progress
and plans on the case from Uzhgorod or other stops in this
operation, nor obtain permissdon to travel alcne with the agent
to Lvov and Minsk after the recruitment; the local KGB's in
Uzhgorod, Lvov, and Minsk did that, he said. NOSENKO could
not describe KGB arrangements and support in Lvov and Minsk,
where he said "the only thing I needed was a car from the air-
port to the city." said they travelled by train.)
Likewise, NOSENKO was unable to describe the KGB procedures
for clearance, tracing, reporting and other management of this
operation.

{iv) The Agent “PRIPPEL

FRIPPEL (Pages 129-135) is the only American citizen with
whom NOSENKO ever had more than fleeting operational contact
in his whole KGB career and is the only foreign agent he claims
to have run for more than two meetings at any time in his car-
eer (with the exception of Q@ke@RBB, pages 201-212, and “PROKHOR,"
Pages 173-181). The American Express Company representative
in Moscow, FRIPPEL was not recruited so that he could report
on American tourists visiting the Scviet Union, or on official
and unofficial Americans living there, but in hopes of learn=
ing about approaches being made to members of Soviet delegations
visiting the United States. With a weaith of reporting assets
in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB did nct need him there. When
PRIPPEL was reassigned to New York City, however, there were
no plans to contact him through the local KGB Legal Residency.
FRIPPEL. is identified by. XGB cryptonym in the CHEREPANOV papers
as a suspected American Intelligence agent. That FRIPPEL was
considered such by the KG83 is confirmed by statements of a self=
admitted KGB agent in contact with the American tourist ROBERTS |
in 1962.

IOP SECREI |

701,

NOSENK9 said PRIPPEL was his agent and said, repeatedly:
“I recruited himmyself.” In 1962 no other KGB officer was
mentioned by NOSENKO, who qucted from a nimber of his conver- L
sations with PRIPPEL. In 1964 NOSENKO said he and CHELNOKOV
*had carried out the recruitment together," but NOSENKO was the
case officer. According to FPRIPPEL's account, CHELNCKOV was
the senior officer in the recruitment and in the later meetings.

NOSENKO never met FRIPPEL alone while FRIPPEL was stationed
in Moscow. The only times he ever did so were later, he said,
when PRIPPEL returned to the USSR, and these consisted of a brief 5
‘visit to FRIPPEL's hotel room during FRIP?EL's visit to Moscow |
in the summer of 1962 and a short meeting in Odessa where FRIP- i
PEL was on a cruise in February 1963. (Both of these meetings ‘
took place after NOSENKO, in his 1962 contacts with CIA, had I
exposed FRIPPEL az a KGB agent.) According to PRIPPEL, in the
February 1963 meeting. NOSENKO phoned someone to ask whether)
he could accept PRIPPEL's invitation to board the ship; the
answer was evidently no. NOSENKO denied this, insisting that +
there was no one in Odessa superior to nim, and as a Deputy De- ‘
partment Chief, he would not have to ask anyone anyway.

ISENKO, CHELNOKOV, and their wives dined at FRIPPEL's
house in Moscow some time after FRIPPEL's recruitment. NOSENKO
acknewledged this to have been a moet unusual procedure and
could name no parallel in KGB agent handling. Asked why it
happened, he said: “Because he invited me," and when asked
why CHELNCKOV ard his wife went along, NOSENKO said: “Because
he was also involved in the recruitment.*

NOSENKO said he retained operdtional control of FRIPPEL,
then still Moscow representative of a tourist firm, when KOSENKO
shifted in June 1960 from the Tourist Department to the Areri-
can Department; Later NOSENXO also raintained responsibility :
for contact duking FRIPPEL's visits to the USSR after FRIPPEL's 1
PCS departure from Moscow in January 1961 and after his own re-
turn to the Tourist Department. According to FRIPPEL, who saw
no sign of change in NOSENKO’s reponsibilities during his rela-
tionship with him, he recalled meeting CHELNOKOV (who had t
Stayed in the Tourist Department) alone, without NOSENKO, prob~
ably in ‘1960.

FRIPPEL said he was queried by NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV only
once concerning U.S. Embassy personalities, specifically on
BOWDEN and WINTERS. NOSENKO, who claimed case officer re-
sponsibility for Embassy Security Officer ABIDIAN in 19€0-1961
as well as for PRIPPEL said the two did not know each other;
in fact, they met sociaily several times. NOSENKO could re-
call nothing which FRIPPEL ever reported to or did for the KGB, 1
dismissing the aubject on several occasions with: “He never
gave anything of value." The only question NOSENKO posed
when he cate to FRIPPEL in August 1962, FRIPPEL said, was
whether the agent knew “what the newspaper editors he was es- i
corting were going to ask KHRUSHCHEV in an interview. Accord- |
ing to FRIPPEL, in the February 1963 meeting NOSENKO posed
no questions and merely made polite conversation until FPRIPPEL
excused himself.

and NOSENKO) used against tourists; were
from continental Europe; BARRETT and WILLERFUFD worked in Moscow
for several months. The tabulaticn also shows that, according
to NOSENKO, his operational work was ccnsiceracly more intensive
in the time after he became Deputy Chief of the section than
before, when as a senior case officer his administrative respon-
sibilities presumably would have been far less demanding.

Although NOSENKO's participation in five cases of the Aneri-
can Tourist Secticn is confirmed, his acknowledged role in five
othere of different varieties--with corroboration by other
sources in two of them--raises doubts stout whetner he belonged
to that section as a senior officer. The doubts are strengthened

by the nature of his information about the four individual cases "
reviewed at length above: i

of the extensive background information on the recruitment

target which the KGE possessed at the time of the approach;

or of other significant details in what NOSENKO described

as an operation of greatest importance to the American Tour-

ist Section and to himself personally. In addition, NOSENKO

has admitted lying about his having received an award for

his role in the recruitwent of BURSI. 1

: \
- In the BURGI case NOSENKO did not have knowledge !
i

- Regarding the DREW case, NOSENKO said he was chosen
for the approach (made on the basis of homosexuality) be-~
cause the regular case officer lacked operational experi-
ence. By April 1959, however, the KGB had arranged “hurdreds”
of homosexual compromises in the USSR, NOSENKO reported in
another context. His earlier personal experience with
Western targets had been limited to a secondary role in
the BURGI case and a principa:i role in the HARRIS case,
the latter not an approach on honosexual grounds. It is
difficult to comprehend how NOSENKO would have qualified
for the task whereas the case officer IVANOV would not.

--There are gaps in NOSENKO's information about a
number of significant aspects in the BEEEBE@Pcase, includ-
ing staff planning and manejement of the operation, opera- fl
tional support arrangements, and on personnel of the outlying
KGB units involved. NOSENKO was unable to explain why he
was selected to make the approach to

- CHELNOKOV was the senicr case officer for FRIPPEL.
NOSENKO never met this agent alone while he resided in
Moscow as the American Express Company representative,

. and NOSENKO reportedly acted on a supervisor's instruc- i
tions at their later meeting in Odessa. Despite his occue {
pation and his entree into the American community ir Moscow, i
FRIPPEL reportedly was not exploited by the KGB against |
tourists or U.S. Government employees but was targetted
to report on matters to which he had no access; hence
there seems to have been no logical reason for the FRIPPEL
ease to have been transferred from the American Tourist
Section to the U.S. Embassy Section and back again. Al- .
though available information verifies the continuity of
NOSENKO as FRIPPEL's handler, it cannot be considered firm Hl
evidence of NOSENKO having been an officer in either of H
these sections and in fact might be interpreted as evidence
that he was not.

’ Similarly, while familiar with some but not all of the opera-
tional activities of the homosexual agents VOLKOV and YEFREMOV, —
NOSENKO failed to support his claim to being their American
Tourist Section case officer; he has been unable to provide
rudimentary background information of these two individuals,
who allegedly were prominent in operations of the section.

YEFREMOV because they were too well known is incompatible with —..

hie other reporting to the effect that neither took part in an
Operation between 1959 and early 1962.

In further reference to NOSENKO's claims to having been
the case officer in these various operations, he has been ugable
to recount in any detail KGB staff procedures involved in these
Operations, such ag name-tracing, coordinating with other com-
ponents, obtaining approvals for action, etc. Pinally, of his
alleged 54 months of service in the American Tourist Section,
NOSENKO's described activity against foreigners accounts for
only about three months; if the bulk of his tine was spent with
recruiting or handling Soviet-citizen agents, he might be ex-
pected to remember something about some of them. He can barely
remember names (and only a few), haa given confused accounts of
their recruitment, remembers nothing about any of their spe-
cific operations or activities for the KGB, and knew no per-
sonality background data on any of then.

Even if it were assumed that NOSENKO was a case officer of
the American Tourist Section, his claim to the position of Deputy’,
Chief cannot be substantiated. He hinself could

col

when he was allegedly in @ supervisory capacity. NOSENKO
knew nothing about the documents on such operations which BLAKE
gave the KGB and which can be presumed to have been of the ut-
most interest to the American Touriet Section, among all KGB
Headquarters elements, These documents offered material that
could have proven valuable to the preparation of. NOSENKO's own
paper on Western tourist operations; they were used in the genu~
ine KGB paper written by the Tourist Department and passed to
CIA by GOLITSYN. As with his status as a case officer in the
American Tourist Section, NOSENKO the Deputy Chief could not
@escribe how data on tourists was received, general and spe-
cific plans laid, events discussed, decisions made, and lpads
channeled.

The foregoing paragraphs suggest the conclusion that NOSENKO
a8 not a senior case officer or the Deputy Chief of the Ameri-
an Tourist Section, While the methods of the Tourist Depart-

Ment are not independently known in detail, it is conceivable
that what NOSENKO did on behalf of the KGB (not necessarily the
American Tourist Section) could have been accomplished by a
Principal agent. These conclusions do not cast doubt about
the facts presented by NOSENKO on the KGB investigations in the
OSWALD case but merely rule out the possibility of NOSENKO's
having been involved with this case in any way prior to the
assassination of President Kennedy.

6. U.S. Embassy Scction (1969-1961)

a. Introduction H

From January 1960 until January 1962 NOSE! claims
to have been Deputy Chief of the U.S. Erbassy Section of
the American Department, KGB Second Chie Directorate,
under KOVSAUK. This period (described in Pages 152-285)
is the most significant in Nos: 1KO's account of his KGB
career for a number of reasons:

- The section is the specific unit working against
the U.S. Exbassy, by NOSENKU's cwn state ats the #GB's
most important counterinteligence target on the USSR.
Its operations (characterized cn Page 152) directly ‘
affect American security. The section has the twe-
fold purpose uf knowing of ana < rolling ati access
of Embassy personnel to Scviet ci : of collecting,
asgimilating, evaluating, and usirg infor:
all possible sources to recruit Anericar
in Moscow,

~ NOSENKG's position as Ceputy Chief cf this secm
tion provided hin his access to “ost of the major counter-
intelligence infornation ie has reported, inciuding
yecruitments of foreicn embassy officials and micro-
phone operations against the U.S. Enbassy Most impor-
tant, it provided NOSENKO with his authority for
stating that there were no successful recruitments
of or agents among official Americans in “oscow for
this two-year period, or for at both cetore and
after. (This is the same point made by incirection in
the CHEREPANOV papers; yet this view is contradicted
by information from GOLITSYN. Although the latter did
not serve in the U.S. Fmbassy Section, he knew menbers
of it and gave leads to KGD operational interest in
and possible recruitwnents of official Americans in the
Moscow Embassy during this period. Some of these appear
to be related to information items NOSF! *%O nas provided.)

= The apparent importance of NOSENKO's information

on this period contrasts sharply with that from other

< periods. His accounts of recruitments in the tourist
Field covering the five years prior td this assignment
and the two years following have been checked thoroughly
and not one of them represents a penetraticn of any
government; none has access to classified? information;
most were inactive, suspect, or already known to
Western counterintelligence organs.

b. Entry into the Section

NOSENKO has given a detailed account of how he came to
be transferred into the U.S. Embassy Section, but he has
never given a precise date, usually saying “January 1960"
or “at the beginning of 1960."

As described on Pages 153-154, the shift was made at
GRIBANOY's insistence and against NOSLNKO's own personal
wishes. GHIBANOY told NOSENKO during a personal interview,
at which KOSENKO voiced his objections, that the transfer
was part of his (GRIBANOV's) plans and was primarily to put
new life into operations against American code clerks, the
primary target of the Second Chicf Directorate. GRIBANOV
did not tell him why he, instead of another, had been
selected for this job, although NOSENKO had the impression
it was because of his achievements in the Tourist Depart-
ment. (sec Part VIII.P.5.). NOSENKO's transfer could not
have been a result of his close personal relationship with
GRIBANOV or because his father was a friend of GRIBANOV's:
NOSENKO has admitted that he exaggerated the clorcaess of
his relationship with the Chief of the Second Chief Directo~
rate and most recently (February 1965) said that he had few
personal contacts with him outside of work; NOSENKO has also
said that his father never met GRIPANOV.

NOSENKO initially said that he relieved nobody on
coming into the scction. He eventually recalled, however,
that BAKHVALOV was his predecessor but left the section
before he (NOSENKO) arrived, NOSENKO's confusion on this
point, his description of how he assumed custody of certain
files from BAXHVALOV although the latter had transferred to
another department, and the opportunitics NOSENEO had to
name BAKHVALOV as his predecessor before he eventually did
so are described on Pages 154-156.

c. Functions as Deputy Chief

In NOSENKO's view the transfer to become Deputy Chief
of the section from the same position in another section
was definitely an important promotion: He now became
second-inecharge of the most important operational section
of the entire Second Chief Directorate. As KOVSHUK's
deputy, NOSENKO had the right and obligation to be aware of
all activities in order to exercise his general supervisory
functions and so as to be prepared to become the Acting
Chief of the section when necessary.

NOSENKO said that consequently nothing was hidden from
him for the two years 1960 and 1961. He claimed to have
had complete knowledge of the U.S, Embassy Section's activi-
ties during the relatively recent years of 1960 ard 1961
and to know of all significant operational successes achieved

in the years before and after this period. He has alsa-said he
has told CIA all he knows of these activities. It was on this

basis that he was able to say in 1965; “Tell Mr. MeCone

that there were no recruitments. I was there.”

When NOSENKO reported for duty, he and KOVSHUK agreed
on a division of supervisory duties within the section.
KOVSHUK was, in addition to his over-all responsibility for



707.

the section's operations, to supervise in particular opera-
tional activity against American diplomatic personnel assigned
to the U.S. Fmbassy. NOSENKO had been specifically instructed
by GRIBANOV and American Department Chief KLYPIN to concentrate
his efforts on the supervision of operations against the

most important American recruitment target, the code clerks
at the Embassy, with the aim of revitalizing these acti-
vities and making recruitments. (NOSENKO said there had

been none since the early 1950's.) According to the agreed-
upon division of labor, NOSENKO also assumed cese officer
responsibility for John ABIDIAN, the Eabassy Security offi-
cer (identified by NOSENKO 3s a CIA officer. duc actually a
CIA cooptee). Additionally, he was responsible for maintaining
the section's file on factors pertaining to the physical
security of the Embassy and for receiving and disseminating
materials from the microphones concealed in various U.S.
Embassy offices, These were functions held, NOSENKO said,

by hig predecessor BAKHVALOV and were turned over by NOSENKO
at the end of 1961 to his successor GRYAZNOV: Apart from
these duties, which apparently were routinely assumed by

the Deputy Chief, NOSENKO supervised, during the early part

of 1960 (as NOSENKO first said in 1965), the work of the
officers responsible for operations against the Amorican

Avmned Forces Attachos 1 Muscow; in October 1966, NOSENKO
reported that he was personally responsible during this

period for the operatioml activity against Naval and Marine
officers in the Naval Attache's office.

d. xnowledgeability as Deputy and Acting Chief

As deputy to KOVSHUK, NOSENKO said, he was aware of
all the operations being conducted by the section during
this two-year period; by his own statenent, nothing was
kept from him. There were in these two years a total of
over three months when KOVSHUK was ill or on leave, and at
these times NOSENKO was acting chief of the section. In
the latter capacity, NOSENKO was responsible for supervising
the administrative work and operational activity of the en-
tite section and, in particular, assumed KOVSHUK's work ip
directing operations against diplomatic personnel assigned to
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Therefore, pértinent to his
claims are the facts presented in the following paragraphs.

NOSENKO could not remember any operational decisions
that he made as acting chief, or any specific or unusual
occurrences during these times. In answer to a question,
NOSENKO said that the only specific responsibility of KOVSEUE's
which he handled in the Chief's absence was reporting to the
Chief of the First Department about all correspondence going
out of the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO did not meet any of KOVSHUK's agents during his
absences. He could not remember any of KOVSHUK's agents,
except GLAZUNOV (whom NOSENKO said in April 1964 was his own
agent and later said was "KOVSHUK's and FEDYANIN's") and
the American correspondent STEVENS (about whom NOSENKO had
reported in connection with his responsibilities in 1953-55).
NOSEKKO also said that in 1960 KCVSHUX recruited PREISFREUND,
although earlier he had reported that he (SOSENKO) had dose
this. (Regardless of who‘the recruiter might have been,
KOVSHUK attended NOSENKO's meetings with PREISFREUND. )

NOSEKKO knew that his immediate supervisor KOVSEUR had per-
sonal contect, under Ministry of Foreign Affairs cever, with sore
U.S. Exbassy officers and was aware that one of these had been
WINTERS. He knew no details of KOVSHUK's contzcts with (WINTERS,
nor that his own friend KISLOV, as well as his friend and fow-
quent source of operational information LOPUKHOV, were also in
touch with WINTERS] He could not remember who else KOVEHUK
knew, cr what KOVSHUK was doing with them, or why. NOSENKO
knew neither that William MORRELL (declared to the Soviet Govern-
ment a8 a CIA officer) belonged to CIA nor that KOVSHUK, who
was aware of this fact, was in personal contact with MORELL,

Unlike KOVSHUA, ARTEMEV, KOSOLATOV, BORODIN, BIRYUKOV,
KRIVOSKEY and many other Second Chief Directorate officers,
HOSENKO never had any direct contact, even for cultivation
or assessment, with any Americar officials, either stationed
in the Embassy or visiting the USSR. However, his English
had been proven gcod cnough to qualify him particularly for
tourist recruitments and his operationa? flair hed been tested.
(It was this which caused him to be picked for the. DPEd,

and other approaches and the cnly 1easor why he,
an ingiish speaker @ have been specially selected to
work on the German) who spoke “sone Eng ")

DERYABIN and other defectors from the KGB have stated
that the deputy chief of a section working against 2 foreign
exbassy in Mosccw would be responsible for approving and
retaining menthly schedules for the planned use of safehouses
by the section; that he would discuss agent meeting scusdules

val case officers and approve and retain a list
of planned agent meetings for each case officer on an indi-
vidual basis; and that he would approve the acquisition of new
agents and new safehouses and their transfer frou one opera~
tion to another. By contrast, NOS O first did not list
these furc’ ns arong his responsibilities and later denied
that he had them. NOSENO did rot understand the questica
when asked whether he had any responsibility for supervising
the use of safehovses in Moscow (Page 102) ance said that as
the agents and the safehouses belonged to the case cfficers,
they could use them when and how they liked without informing
anyone; only when they were meeting an active development
agent was it necessary to report to NOSENKO and this only
after the meeting. NOSENKO said that, while he was veputy
Chief of the section, three or four subordinate officers had
safe apartments, but he did not remember the location of any
of them. Neither NOSENKO ncr his subordinates GRYAZNOV and
KOSOLAPOV had such apartments, instead using less secure
"meeting apartn s" (which are used in the absence cf the
full-tize occupant). NOSEXKO was able to locate his own
“meeting apartment” (which he said ne brought with him when
he transferred from the Tourist Department and iater took
back with him to the Tourist Department) by street and could
do the same for GRYAZNOV's. He was not sure of the lecation
of the apartment used by KOSOLAPOV.

e. Knowledgeabdility of U.S. Embassy Physical Security

According to NOSENKO, he maintained the file on physical
security at the U.S. Embassy, and it contained detailed
floor plans and photograpns of the installation. NOSESKO was
unable to give the location or the floor of the office of
any single individual or component of the Embassy, including
those of the Ambassador, or his own targets (ABIDIAN. the
military code room, and the State Department communications
roorn).  ROSKNKO wadd that Al) important Estacdy wt (tive
were located in the "gone of securtty." which he has variously
reported as the “seventh, eighth, ninth, end tenth floors,"
or “seventh and up," or the “top four floors." NOSENKO did
not remember how many floors there are in the Embassy, nor
was he even sure how many floors were included in the restric-
ted area. (The restricted area in fact consists of the top
three floors, the eighth, ninth, and tenth.)

f. Knowledgeability atout American Intelligence Personnel

NOSENKO said that not only the deputy chief but every
officer in the section could identify the known and suspected

' Azerican Intelligence personnel in_the. Embassy. a
, and vhom the KGB had definitely identified

as such assignments to Moscow in 1960-1961. For
example, lr pe soviet unites was officially
announce: ry Embassy t the Sovie r of Foreign
Affairs, was under direct and active cultivation by KOVSHUK
and the KGB First Chief D:rectorate officer K.N. SMIRSOV in
1960-1961; NOSENKO knew nothing about this (although asked
i iven hints) and did not identify

Four of the seven officers shom
he Said the Ey to be CIA had never had any such
affiliation. He could not give any information at_all-on_

sss J
a either on his Woscow activity and contects
or on id results of KGB coverage,.or on his per-

tuation and backgrpund. He could _nof explain why
was considered to but said that
“every officer thought he was.”

g- Knowledgeability of KGB Code Clerk Operations

As his main task, the prime reason he vas moved into
the U.S. Embassy Section, NOSENKO alleged, was to supervise
the operational work against American code clerks. In this
capacity he closely guided the work of case officers GRYAZNOV
and KOSOLAPOV.* NOSENKO shared an office with his two sub-
ordinates, and the three were within sight and hearing of

*According to GOLITSYN, wo knew both men well, GRYAZNOV was
"a very experienced" case officer with some success; he had
spent about the last five years of his 16 years in the KGB

in the American Department and was a specialist in code

clerk operations. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had about

ten years’ KGB experience and, like GRYAZNOV, was specializing
against code clerks in 1960.

one anothcr and used a single safe, which contained files

on the Anerican code clerks and the agents involved with them.
NOSENKO said that he carefully directed the work of GRYAZNOV

. and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing their cascs
with them, taking part in operational planning, and approvirg
or disapproving all operational measures. NOSENKO originally
asserted that he tad also read and studied all the files

kept on the American code clerks; under questioning on indivi-
dual cases, however, he retracted these statements and said
that he may Lave skimmed some of the files, that he did not
study any of thom, but that in any event he read all the
current incomirg materials on the code clerks from microphones,
agents, and the like and then routed them to the case officer
concerned.

CIA has two types of information against which the rem
ports from NOSENKO can be compared. The first consists of
the detailed cebriefings of code clerks returning from
Moscow, administered routinely by the Department of State
and the military services; it also includes the special de-
briefings and interrogations of the Department of State,
the FBI, and CIA as a follow-up to KGB opcrational activity
which has become known from various sources, On this basis,
CIA has accumulated a considerable amount of collateral
information on the activities of the U,S, Exbassy Section
involving United States code clerks during the period NOSEN~
KO said he was its Deputy Chief. The second type of infor=
mation is the reporting on KGB operations by GULITSYN sho,
from contacts with U.S. Embassy Section officers in Moscow
and Helsinki, was able to provide several lcads to what he
said were recruited American code clerks. GOLITSYN's infor
mation thercby directly contradicts NCSENKO's statement that
the KGB had no successes in its code clerk recruitment opera~
tions from the early 1950's to the end of 1963, and none of
the subjects of GOLITSYN's leads have been positively identi-
fied. Some of GOLITSYN's information has been generally
substantiated by other sources. In one case, this confirma—
tion has come from NOSENKO himself, whose information on “the
'STORSDERG operation, onthe agent’ PREISFREUND's role in it,
and on GOLITSYN's knowledge of KGB use of PREISFREUND pre-
sents an explanation of one and possibly two of GOLITSYN's
leads.* Another of GOLITSYN's leads, that concerning ao
operational trip by KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki in order to estab-
lish contact with a code clerk, is confirmed by documentary
evidence that KOSOLAPOV did in fact travel on the Helsinki~
Moscow train with an American code clerk at the time and
under the cover GOLITSYN reported. NOSENKO denied that such
a trip was made by KOSOLAPOY.

NOSENKO has been questioned in detail about each of the
code clerks serving in Moscow during 1960 and 1961. His in-
formation concerning KGB activities involving five of these
Americans (STORSBERG, JENNER, MORONE, ZUJUS, and KEYSERS) and

*As discussed below, there are important differences in the
accounts of GOLITSYN and NOSENKO, particularly regarding the
outéome of this operation.

his lack of information conce: ning a sixth (GARLAND) is
@iscussed in detail in Pages 166 through 219. NOSENKO's:
information on a number of other cases, less important in
his opinion, is described in the tabulation of American
case leads given on Prges 364-410. Certain of these cases
are further examined below to determine whether NOSENKO's
knowledge equates with details which the deputy and acting
chief of the U.S. Embassy Section could reasonably be

expected to know and retain.

(4) The STORSBERG Case

The operation against STORSBERG (Pages 166-185) was,
NOSENKO said, the must important case he had as supervisor
of code clerk operations. The KGB, while able to break
Certain State Department ciphers, had had no svecese with
military cryptographic systems, and therefore NOSERKO
“dropped everything for a year” to involve himself with the
development of James STORSBERG, th military code clerk at
the U.S. Embassy. The following facts are pertinent to an
evaluation of NOSENKO’s story of this case.

NOSENKO originally raised the STORSBERG case indirectly
at his first meeting with CLA on 9 June 1962. He told how
GOLITSYN, during a visit to the Ancrican Department in 1960,
at a time NOSENKO was on leave, had requested permission
to use a U.S. Embassy Section agent, a Finn, in his own opera-
tions in Helsinki. During his discussions in the American
Department, GOLITSYN learned that this Finnish agent was
being used in operations against Embassy employees living in
America House. NOSENKO said that the KGB realized that
GOLITSYN bad passed this information on to the Americans
following his defection, for the regulations governing
visits to America House by third nationals had been tightened.
At this mecting NOSENKO did not name the Finnish agent or
specify his involvement in any particular operational acti-
vity nor did he date the visit by GOLIISYN.

Later in the 1962 meet ing NOSENKO gave a detailed
summary of the Finnish agent's involvement in the unsuccess~
ful recruitment attempt against an American military code
clerk. NOSENKO, without naming the Finn or the American,
said that he personally conducted the recruitment confron-
tation with GRIBANOV present. These early accounts vere full
of quotes of shat NOSENKO said to the American and vice
versa. descriptions of the American's reaction to the confron-
tation, and statenents of NOSENKO's admiration for the Ameri-
can despite his refusal to work. Following his defection,
NOSENKO recounted the case in even greater detail, in fact,
in more detail than he gave for any other case. He identi-
fied the Finn as PREISFREUND ard the American as STORSBERG
and described acd referred to the case whenever possible
(over 50 times). When asked for details of other code clerk
cases, for example, he repeatedly diverted to discussion of
the STORSBERG case to illustrate how the KGB operated against

code clerks in general.

After defecting NOSENKO denied that he personally con~
fronted STORSBERG. He said that his personal role was limited
to directing STORSEERG into the hotel rooa where the approach
was made; after first saying that he had never claimed any
other role, he admitted that he may have been “painting”

hixnself (exaggerating) in his deseri:rions of 1962, This
aduission came only after the tape of NOSENKO's 1362
statezents had been played to hin and he had successively
said that (a) it was not bis voice, (b) ho was drunk in
1962, (ec) the CIA case officer in Geneva had made his
nervous, and (d) CIA probably spliced various picces of
tape together to make this false one. Still, NOSENKO
said, ha directed the entire operation from beginning to end,
and it was his most important case. Interrogated further
concerning his role in the STORSBERG operation in October
1956, NOSENKO said that he had never read the KGB file on
STORSBERG, which was held by GRYAZNOV. a

GOLITSYN, as NOSENKO reported, didvisit the American —
Department, did request permission to use PREISFREUND operaa
tionally in Helsinki, and did report this to CIA in late
196] following his defection. GOLITSYN also reported that,
in denying his request, KOVSHUK told him that PREISFREUND
had recently been used in the successful recruitment of an
American Embassy employce, possibly a military man and pos=
sibly a code clerk or diplomat; therefore, KOVSHUK said,
PRETSFREUND: could rot be used for six months or so in other
operations, tor otherwise the Asericans might become suspi-
cious, NOSENKO has not reported these details, but has said
only that GOLITSYN was instructed to. drop interest in PREIS
FREUND because PREISFREUND belonged to the American Department
of the Second Chief Directorate.

XOSENKO volunteered at his first meeting with CIA that
he was on leave outside of Moscow on the occasion of COLITSYN's
visit to the American Department. Since defecting he has

in ted with absolute certainty that this visit took place
iz the late spring or carly summer of 1961 and has described
his leave, where he went and with whom. GOLITSYN's passport

and CIA travel data show that GOLITSYN was on TDY in Moscow
in January 1961.* ‘Told this, NOSENKO said that it is untrue,
that he recalled being told of GOLITSYN's visit after his
return from leave in July 1961, and that he was certain that
he (NOSENKO) was in Moscow in January 1961.

NOSENKO has indirectly confirmed that the operation of
which GOLITSYN learned during this visit to the American
Department was the operation against STORSBERG. He did so by
his assertion that PREISFREUND, his own agent, was used in
only one operation, that against STORSBERG. ‘Thus, as to the
outcome of this operation, there is a conflict between NOSEN-
KO's information and that earlier provided by COLITSYN.

There is also a conflict between NOSENKO's statements that
the recruitment approach took place some time after May 1961
(NOSINKO's dates have varied from June to October 1961,
STORSBERG said it was in October 1961) and GOLITSYN's state-
ment that this approach had already been made in January 1961
when he learned of it.

GOLITSYN provided a second lead which NOSENKO appears
to confirm and which may be related to the STORSBERG case.
GOLITSYN said that during a visit to the American Department

#GOLITSYN has based his assertion that NOSENKO was not in
the U.S. Embassy Section in 1960 and 1961 partly on this visit.

in the spring of 1960,* he lcarned from GRYAZNOV that he
(GRYAZKOV) had developed an operation against an American
military code clerk to the point that the KGB was "99 ‘
per cent" certain that # recruitment spproach to this code
clerk would be succesaful. GOLITS’N said that CRYAZNOV

told him that this would be the first recruitment of a mili-
tary code clerk (as contrasted to a State Department code
clerk) in the history of the American Department. There
were only two persons meeting this criterion who were in
Moscow at the tine GOLITSYN placed this visit, STORSBERG

ard HURLEY; the superior of STORSBERG, HURLEY perforned
back-up cryptographic duties in STORSBERG's absence. If
NOSENKO's report that there was no developacnt of or approach
to HURLEY can be accepted, this lead from GOLITSYN would
apply to STORSBERG rather than HURLEY. There is a conflict
hotween NOSENKO's information on the STORSBERG case and this
second GOLITSYN lead in that GOLITSYN described an operation
which was in its final stages in the spring of 1960, whoreas
NOSENKO (as well as STORSBEPG) asserted that the STORSBFRG
operation was just under way at this time and wes long and
drawn-out. : .

(i1)) The JENNER Case

Apart from the STORSBERG operation, NOSENKO has been
able to supply the greatest amount of detail concerning the
operation (also unsuccessful) against the State Department
pouch clerk Paul JENNER (Pages 186-196). This case developed
as a result of an idea originated by NOSENKO himself shortly
after he arrived in the U.S, Embassy Section. Because of
the inaccessibility of American code clerks to the RGB in
Moscow, it was NOSENKO's plan to send a KGB officer to Hel-
sinki in order to strike up an acquaintance with x code

-elerk entering the Soviet Union aboard the Helsinki-Moscow

train, The first (and last) time this was attempted, NO-
SENKO related, was in March 1960, whea the KCB learned that
JENNER, listed as a "secretary-archivist" and thus assumed
by the KGB to be a code clerk, was scheduled to transit
Helsinki en route to his assignrent at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow. Under NOSENKO's supervision KOSOLAPOV therefore
travelled to Helsinki and boarded the same train as SENNER,!
Additionally, GRYAZNOV took a KGB female agert to the town,
of Vyborg, on the Finno-Soviet border, and placed her on the
same train. Both KOSOLAPOV and the female agent met and
spoke with JENNER en route to Moscow, and the girl gave hin
her telephone number, asking hia to call her. After JENNER's
arrival in Moscow, both KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV subnitted
written reports to NOSENXO describing the contacts on the
train. Although the KGB later found out that JENNER was only
a pouch clerk, not a cryptographer, he was considered of
interest and when JENNER failed to telephone the female
agent, the two were brought together in a “chance meeting"
at the Moscow airport, JENNER would have no part of the
agent's invitations, however, and the operation therefore
went no further.

*When NOSENKO was told of the GOLITSYN visit in May or June
1960, he denied that it took place, saying that he neces
sarily would know if it had.

JENNER reported te the Security Officer at the U.S.
Embassy upon his arrival that he had been contacted by two
Soviet students from Vyborg, @ young mai and a woman, on
the Helsinki-Moscow train, He also reported having been
given a telephone nuzber by the girl and later reported
having been recontacted by her at the Moscow airport.

| ROSENKO identified KOLOSOV's photogreph @s that
of his subordinate KOSOLAPOV. (NOSEXKO earlier said that .
he did not know whether KOSOLAPOV used an alias for‘this
trip, what that alias might have been, or whether KOSOLAPOV
had an alias passport; he agreed that he would have had to
authorize such a passport.) When he was told of CIA evidence
that KOSOLAPOV did not travel on the same train as JENNER
and therefore could not have met and talked with him as
YSENKO had r@orted, NOSENKO refused to belicve it; he in-
sisted that he had read the reports of both KOSOLAPOV and
GRYAZNOV, and that the events were exactly as he described j

then.
(iii) The GARLAND Case il
GOLITSYN told CIA after his defection that while he was Hl

stationed in Helsinki, probably in Novenber--not “arch -~1960, |
KOSOLAPOV travelled to Finland under alias and commercial

cover in order to make the acquaintance of an American code

elerk on the Helsinki-soscow train. KOSOLAPOY's arrival had

eon announced by a cable from KGB Headquarters to the

Helsinki Legal Residency. According to GOLITSY’, the Legal

Residency learned which train this American was to board and :
succeeded in placing KOSOLAPOV ia the same compartment with
him, GOLITSYN saw KOSOLAPOV board the train with this Ameri-
can. Later, when another American Department officer visited
Helsinki, GOLITSYN asked him how KOSOLAFOY's operation with
the code clerk had gone; from the officer's refusal to answer,
GOLITSYN assumed that it had been a success.

KOSOLAPOV made a second
trip to Helsinki in Novemoer 7960, again under the KOLOSOV
alias. L KOSOLAPOV left
Helsinki by train on 16 Novenber 1960 and that one “f his
travelling companions on this train was GARLAND, who was !
en route to Moscow to assume his duties as chief of the
State Department code room at the American Embassy (Page
198). There were no other Americans on this train.

Told that KOSOLAPOV had made a trip to Helsinki in
November 1960 and had travelled to Moscow on the same train
‘as an American code clerk, one of his own targets, KOSENKO
said that this could not be. He agreed that, as in the case
of KOSOLAPOV's trip to meet JENNER, he would necessarily
have been involved in the planning of such a second trip |

i

and would have had to approve arrangements and correspondence
in connection with it. Even if such a trip took place when
NOSENKO was out of Moscow, he said, the details of it would

Mie

have been known to him upon his return, and he would not

have forgotten about the trip. (In fact, CIA travel records show
that KOSOLAPOV arrived in Helsinki on 12 Noveaber 1960 and

that NOSENKO left Moscow for Ansterdam, en route to Cuba,

on 15 November.) NOSENKO has not changed his position that
there was no such trip.

(iv) The MOROXE Case

Like the STORSBERG operation, the MORONE case was men=
tioned at NOSENKO's first meeting with CIA; he cited it as
an example of a technique which NOSENKO introduced for using
third nationals to obtain access to American code cleri:s who
were reluctant to establish contacts with Soviet citizens.
According to NOSENKO's most recent version, given in early
1965, the KGB learned that MORONE and a Marine Guard (BEGGS)
planned to travel to Warsaw on leave. KOSOLAPOV thereupon
drew up an operational plan, edited by NOSENKO and KOVSHUE
and approved by GRIBANOY, proposing that a female agent of
the Polish UB be introduced to MCRONE on the “oscow to War-
saw train for the purpose of obtaining comprorising materials.
KOSOLAPOV arranged with Polish liaison officials in Moscow
to have such an agent sent to Moscow, met her when she
arrived, and briefed ker on the operation, She was thea
placed on MORONE's train together with a KGB technictan
whose task it was to obtain tape recordings of the compro~
mise. Events went according to plan: MORONE «ct the girl
and was intimate with ker on the train, but when the tech-
nician reported to NOSENKO the day after the train arrived
in Warsaw, he said that the tape recordings were of low
quality and unsuitable for their intended purpose. Ina
further attempt to acquire coapronxing material on MORONE,
KOSOLAPOY later brought the UB agent to Moscow, and on this
occasion photographs were obtained of their intimacies in
a Moscow hotel room. Still, the xGB felt, there was not
enough blackmail material to ensure recruitment,
further planned to have the America House maid IV
attempt to lure NORONE to a room in Moscow where truly
comproaising photographs of intimacies with a Sovjet citi-
zen could be obtained. Possibly because they noticed MORONE's
interest in IVANOVA, NOSEYKO said, the Americans ordered
KMORONE out of Moscow before further steps could be taken.

Although NOSENKO provided a considerable amount of
detail on MORONE's trip to Warsaw, there were numerous
variations in his different accounts. In 1962 he said
that he had handled the entire operation himself, including
telephoning Warsaw with the request for the girl; he also
said that the UB obtained compromising photographs in Warsaw
and that several months lates the female agent was brought
to Moscow expressly for the purpose of introducing MORONE to
a Soviet girlfriend, This, NOSENKO said, was successful and
NORONE was soon having intercourse with a KGB agent. While
still in place in Geneva on 1] February 1964 NOSENKO gave @
different version: ‘We," he said, arranged for the girl by
a dispatch pouched to the KGB advisor in Warsaw; moreover
the Poles, who bad obtained compromising photographs in War~
Saw, sent the KGB only pictures of the two kissing, keeping
the best oncs for themselves, and this is why she had to be
brought to Moscow. NOSENKO told the FBI later in February
1964 that compromising photographs had been obtained in War-
saw but no recruitment was attempted because KHRUSHCHEV had

given instructions that no actions were to be taken which
might embarrass then existing good relations with the United
States. When in February 1365 it was pointed out that MORONE
arrived in Warsaw on 14 December 1960 and that NOSENKO left
for Gaba on 15 Ncvember 1960, KOSENKO revised his story of
receiving the personal report of the technician to say that
he had perhaps read the technician's report after returning
from Cuba in cecember 1960.

In accounts given since his defection, NOSENKO has con-
sistently named KOSOLAPOV as MORONE's case officer. KCSOLA~
POV drafted tae plan for the operation on the train, discussed
it with NOSEN%O and KOVSHUK, met with a U3 official in Mcscow
to arrange for the agent, met the agent on her arrival, and
briefed her on her assignment. NCSENKO hes not been asked
and has not volunteered who specifically placed the agent
on the train. Records show, however, that MORONE left Moscow
on 13 November 1960, arriving in Warsaw on the 14th; from
12 to 16 November 1960, KOSOLAFOV is confirmed to have been
in Helsinki, apparently in connection with an operation in-
volving the Aterican code cler (see above). It is
also noted that NOSENKO, the officer
supervising this (as well, presumably, aS KOSOLAPOV's trip

_ to Helsinki), left Moscow on 15 November 1960 with a dele-

gation going to Cuba.

NOSENKO has been ‘questioned concerning the KGB agents
in contact with MORONE and what was learned from them. He
reported that an Egyptian agent visited Anerica House, met
MOROKE there, but did not report anything of interest con-
cerning him. NCSENKO also mentioned IVANCVA, a maid at
Anerica House, who knew MORONE and whom the XGB wanted to use
to lure MOPONE into a compromising situation (see above).
WOSENKO said that he, himself, had met with IVANOVA several
times to discuss MURONE, but that he could not recall eny-
thing specific of interest or use that she reported concerning

him. Another agent who may have reported on MORONE, NOSENKO
gaid, was an East Gervaan girl fent to Ancrica Hevse to pose
as an Austrian; NCSENKO was not sure what she might have
reported or when this was, other than it occurred when he
was working against WORONE and that it wos during ABIDIAN's
tour in Moscow, for he had cozo to America Iicuse to question
the girl.

Various reperts indicate that XMORONE was. involved in
illegal currency speculation with the Egyptiar agent and
that on at least one occasion the Feyptian introduced MGRONE
to a Sovict female, with whom MORONE was intimate, NOSEXKO
did not know that RONE was also involved in illegal cur-
rency dealings witi hom NOSENKO has identified as
KOSCLAPCY's agent aid who, ne said, was involved with and
reporting on NOSENKO'S target ABIDIAN. NOSENKO did not know
that IYANOVA once incroduced WORONE to a Soviet fenale, with
whom YORONE was intinate; additionally MOROXE was reported
by a nuaber of his co-residents at Anerica House to aave been
intimate with LVANOVA herself (which MORONE denied). Some
of these samc Americans reported also that NORONE was inti~
mate with UMANETS, another KGB agent identificd by NOSENKO;
MORCNE hinself said he knew UMANETS "yell." Finally, the
ineident involving the East Gernan girl posing as an Austrian
involved the code clerk ZUJUS, not MORONE, and took place
after NOSES clains to have been transferred from tne US.

(v) The KEYSERS C

Tho approach to KEYSERS 1s the only tine during his
service in the U.S, Embassy Section that NOSEXKO claims to
bave had direct contact with an American Stationed in tose
cow. (NOSENKO said on onc occasion that this was the only
face-to-face encounter he could recall; and, 2m another, -
that it was possible that STURSEFRG--the onl; other possibility--
may not havc seen hia on the night he was approached in the
Moscow hotel.) KEYSERS therefore is the only independent
American source tho could confirm that SOSENKO was involved
in operations against Aacrican Enbassy personnel in 1960 or
1961. NOSENKO himself pointed cut, however, that this con=
tact was of very short duration, and that it was possible
that KEYSERS would not recognize him. This was the case:
KEYSERS failed to identiiy NOSENKO's photograph and described
the officer wno approached him as @ man considerably older,
shorter, and probably of a much heavier build than NOSEXKO
was, Although NOSENKO was able to provide a description of
this incident, he did not know much about the overall KGB
case against KEYSERS and a number of discrepancies have been
noted.

In 1962 NOSENKO first reported the approach to KEYSERS,
without naming him, but saying he was the successor to STORS-
BERG. Since defecting in 1964, NOSENKO has continued to
identify hin as STCRSBERG's replacement. In fact, KEYSERS
was sent to Moscow as an assistant to the Embassy medical
officer; he also worked in the office of the Air Attache as
a collateral duty and for a short while in 1961 was under
training in the silitary code room as a "back-up" crypto=
srapner er STORSLERG. STORSBERG's replacement in Koscow
was ZU, ° A

TOP SECRET,


718.

On 24 and 28 January 1964, before the defection, NO-
SENKO incorrectly named ZUJUS, who he said was STORSBERG'S:
replacement, as the target of this operation. On 2 February
1964 NOSENKO called a special mceting with his CIA handlers.
to correct this mistake. He said that, in fact, KEYSERS
was STOKSBERG‘’s replacement, and the approach had been made
to him, (Thus NOSENKO had forgotten the name of the one =~
American Exbassy official ha ever approached.)

In February 1965 NOSENKO said that the KGB believed
that KEYSERS did rot report the receipt of the defection
letter and that there was no indication that he had from
microphones or telephone coverage of the U.S. Embassy. In
fact, KEYSERS reported the letter at once in the office of
the Military Attache, where a microphone #as discovered in
1964. NOSENKO had earlicr said that this particular micro~
phone was being monitored around the clock by the KGB.
(KEYSERS' homosexuality and drinking problems Kad also
been discussed widely in Embassy offices. NOSENKO was
unaware of these discussions.) © \

NOSENKO did not know correctly where or how the KGB
ddivercd to KEYSERS the letter which preceded the airport
approach which NOSENKO claimed to have made.

(wi). Other Code Clerk Cases

Frark DA XOSENKO identified DAY as a State Nepartment
code Glerm and the target of either KOSCLAPOV or GRYAZNOV,
As with all other code clerks, NOSENKO was asked whether he
knew of eny interesting information about DAY, whether be
knew of any of DAY's friends in Moscow, or of his travels
inside and outside the Soviet Union, etc. NCSENKO answered
"no" to all these questions. He said that the KGB had no
derogatory information on DAY, was unaware of any vulner~
abilities he might have had, and that no operational mes-
sures were taken against him. Records show that DAY was in
Moscow from #ay 1960 to October 1961. In July 1961 he tra-
velled to the Zaucas with his friend, the U.S. Agricul-
tural Attache BROWN, Z DAY
later reported that the two were under Surveillance by five
persons at all times on this trip, that on one occasion they
found four “repairmzen” in their hotel room upon returning
unexpectedly ahead of schedule, and that another time during
this trip an “attractive and available Soviet female" was
Placed in their train compartment.

John TAYLOR: NOSENKO said TAYLOR was a State Department
code clerk ard the target of KOSOLAPOY. NOSENKO did not
know of TAYLOR's previous service abroad or of any back-
ground information the KGB might have had about hin, He
described an operation against TAYLOR which centered around
his intimacy with a Russian maid (a KGB agent) and his sym
pathy towards the Soviet Union and its people. No compro~
mising photographs were obtained of TAYLOR and the maid,
however, and no approach was made to him, possibly because
the KGB did not want to jeopardize the more important STORS-
BERG case by creating a “flap." According to TAYLOR, he was
intimate wita his maid from about September 1960 uptil the
beginning of 1961. On one occasion they vere intimate in @
“friend's apartment” in Moscow, NOSENKO did not know that
the maid told TAYLOR she was pregnant or that TAYLOR offered

her. money for an abortion. TAYLOR left Moscow in February
1961, whereas the approach to STORSEERG wes reported by
NOSEXEO and STORSBERG to have occurred four to eight months
afterward.

Maurice ZWANG: NOSENKO identificd ZW¥ANG as a State
Departsaent code clerk who was "actively sorked on" during
the 1960-1961 period. An Fgyptisn esgent, whose naze NOSEN
KO did not recall, introduced ZWANG to ® Yeralo KGB agent
in an attesapt to obtain compromising prctcgraphs, but the
agent did not like ZWANG and refused to have intercourse
with hia, At the time NOSENKO left the U.S, Embessy Sec.
tion in January 1962, there was no further activity sur
rounding Z¥ANG, The KGB hed no agente in contact with hin,
and there was co vulnerebility data concerning Kin. hen
ZWANG was interviewed by the State Departrent after returuing
from his Moscow assignment, a polygraph examination indicated
that ZWANG hed had intercourse with his Russian raid, elsce-
where identified by NOSENXO as a KGB ageat; Z*ANG admitted
visiticg the maid's apartment several t s hut dented
intimacies. In March or April 1961, en Egyptian intreduced
ZWANG to another Soviet female; Z#¥ANMG also acnitted visiting
her spartnent cn several occasions, but again denied having
had intercourse with her. ZWANG was reported by various
other Americans stationed in Moscow to have been active in
currency speculation and blrckmarketecring with the Egyptian
and EMEP and agent of KOSOLAPOY according to XOSENKO.
NOSESMO Sas unaware of this.

lance by several teams of the KGB Seventh (Surveillance)

mail censorship, telephone taps, and agent rerorting; it was

NOSENKO said he knew nothing about ARIDIAN'Ss personal
background, his educatio., his studies France, his mili-
tary service, his date of entry into the Stave Department,
his State Departncut rank, his previous foreign assignments
with the State Dipartmeat, or his status as # Foreign Ser-
vice Reserve, Staff, or Officer status (FER, FSS, FSO).
NOSENKO said he tried to learn these thangs, but the informa
tion was unevailable in the Second Chief Directurate cr in
KGB Central files. and although he requested information
from the First Ctier Dircctorate, nothing was received, The
only information the KGB had on ABIDIA™, insofar as NOSENKO
knew, was that contained in ABIDIAN's visa request and in
a report from one of the Legal Residencies in the United
States; the report provided a basis for believing him to be
a CIA officer.

NOSENKO was unaware of the meaning of the initials
YSR, FSS, and FSO. When asked whether he had checked the
Department of State Biographic Register for information on
ABIDIAN's background, lie replied thet this document was not
available to the U.S. Embassy Section; he subsequently.
recalled that there was an old copy of the Biographic Register
“from about 1956" in KOVSHLK's office, but That if Contained

KGB was oot interested in this. He did not znow whether
ABIDIAN changed apartzents in “Moscow, which ke did.

NOSENKO ide: tified GROWAKOVA, an Enbassy language

intelligent and was able to provide persowality sketches on
her students tased ot classroon disc joe. He never

private Russian lessons frem GROM (OVA throvghout his tour
in Moscow and that they discussed i: class h:s past personal
life. travel, education, fiancee, and his trips sbroad to
see his fiancee.

NOSENKO knew that AUIDIAN travelled out of the USSR
two or three times, but had no idea when these trips took
place or what countries ABIDIAN visited. SOSENKO said that,
as ABINIAN's predecessor LANGELLE wis known to have travelled
outside the USSR for operational reasons in connection with
the FUPOV case. it would lave keen of interest to learn
where ALIDIAN had gone, hut the KGR hal so way of finding

lity of photographing AUIDI S passport tpon tis return to

NOSENKO said that ABIDIAN sade no trips outside Moscow

would necessarily have been aware of any suck trip as he
would have had to Mandle all arrangements for surveillance
during it. When NOSENKO vas told that ABID!IAN travelled to
Soviet Armenia in October 1960, NOSENKO said fcr the first
time that he wes on leave in that month. NOSENKO admitted
in October 1966 that he krew nothing of ABIDIAN's trip.

NOSENKO said that he did not know who were ABIDIAN‘s
close American friends in Moscow or his friends and profes-
sional contacts among foreigners therc.

BOSENKO said at the end of the January-February 1965

that the KGB completely controlled this activity through the
use of metka, a thicf powder applied to tac clothing of
foreigners ia the USSR; a trace is left on anything coming
into contact with trested areas, and this can be cetected
by special machines through which all mail pesses. .Despite
the fact that all of ABIDIAN's letters were mailed to KGB
double agents and would therefore have bec detected enyxay,
it was metks, NCSENKO said, which in each case lcd to their
initial identification, After his defection NUSENKO described
how the metka had becn applied to ABIVIAN’s clothing (ane
hence to the letters) by the agent PLDOROVICH, aho began
working as ALIDIAN's meid several nonths sfter ABLUTAN er~
rived in Moscow in March 196U, NOSENKO insisted under inter~
rogation that FEDOROVICN was the aly agent who had access
to ABIDIAN'S aparteent, that he, NOSENKC, personally
briefed her on the application of metka, and that “ev was
sure that ABIDIAN's letters were detected by means of metka.
From a CIA debriefing of ABIDIAN, however. it appears that”
FEDOROVICH did rot begin working av ABIDIAN's maid until
some time in July 1961, whereas ARJDIAN matled his first
letter in Yoscow on 1 April 1961 and ‘is second Vetter on
2 July 1961. ABIDIAN's third letter was mailed on 1 Septem-
ber 1961, after FELOROVICH began to work for him.

i. Reporting on ABIDIAN’
Prop im

NOSENKO's account of the visit by ABIDIAN to the
PENKOVSKIY déad drop site on Pushkin Street in Mosocw is
described in cetarl on Pages 231-225. In summary, NOSENKO
reported that at the end of 1560 or early 1961 KGB surveil-
lance followed ABIDIAN from the U.S, Embassy to Pushkin
Street, where ABLDIAN was noted to enter a residential building.
Upon exanination it was decided that this was a likely
dead drop site, and a stationary surveillance post was as-
signed to watch it. After three months, since nothing sus-
picious had beep noted, this post was removed. The true
significance of the location did not become known to the

Asked why, ia his opinion. ABILIAN went to Pustkin
Street at the tite he did, NCSENKO replied that 4a about
PEU an Anerican tourist or delegation mexzber had gone to
this address. It was the “optnion of the Secure Cuief
Directorate” that this American had selected the site as e®
dead drop lucetion, end that ASIDIAN went tnere merely
to check the suitabilaty of the site for this purpose. In
fact, ABIDIAN scnt to tushkin Street in response to what
appeared to be & prearrenged telephone signal {rea PESKOVS&1
signalling that ae had loaded the dead crop there. It bas
been confirmed that PZNKOVSKIY did not give this signal
and, Lecsuse of the circumstances and type of signal given,
the possibility of coincidence has been ruled cut. CIA hes
therefore concluded that the signal came from the KGB.

The Pusakin Street dead drop site was proposed by
PENKOVSKIY himself in the August 1960 letter through which
he initially contacted CIA, There 16 110 recor3 that a
“tourist or delegation ncuber" visited this eddress. The

J. Responsibility of Supervising Military Attache Operations
On 29 January 1965 NOSEXKO told his interrogator that

for the first five or six months of 1960, immediately after __
transferring to tke U.S. Embassy Section and as part of hia:

responsibilities as its Deputy Chief, he supervised Second
Chief Directorate activities ageinst American service at~
taches tn Moscow. Ey this.he meant, NOSEXKO said, that. when
GAVRILENKO (the case officer for Air Force Attaches),
KURILEXKO (Army Attaches), or BELOGLAZOV (Naval Attaches and
Marines) had any questions or reports to submit, they would
come to him rather than to KOVSHUK, the Chief of the section,
After about six months he was relicved of this duty because
his other duties did not allow eufficient time for this
function and because it was considered more suitable that
ALESHIN, recently assigned to the American Department as
Deputy Chief, be given this responsibility.

NOSENKO had previously been questioned in detail on
his respesibilities in the U.S. Embassy Section, and had never
bofore mentioned this one. SOSENKO told CI.i in June 1964
that when he reported for duty in the U.S. Embassy Section
in January 1960, DRANOV was the responsible case officer for
the Naval Attaches and Marines. Soon after his own arrival,
NOSENKO said, DRANOV was transferred from the section and
his recponsibilities were taken over by BELOGLAZOV, who had
earlier been as=isting DRANOY against these targets.

NOSENKO said on 20 October 1966 that immediately upon,
or at the latest a few weeks after, arriving in the U.S.
Embassy Section, he went on leave for a month. Either
immediately before or right after this leave KOVSHUK told
him that he would be responsible for activities against
the Naval Attaches. DHANOV was retiring and gave NOSENKO
the files on Naval and Marine personnel. This was NOSENKO's
first mention either of the leave period in early 1960 or
of having had case officer responsibilities for personnel
of the Naval Attache's office in Moscow. (At the same time
he said that he had lied about going on leave in November
1960.)

NOSENKO was reminded on 25 October 1966 that he had
said in 1965 that in 1960 he was supervisor of operations
against all U.S. service attache personnel. NOSENKO re=
plied; "I took the files only on the Navy, but I was working
on [supervising] all of thea.”

KOSENKO has never volunteered details of specific
operational activity he handled as the case officer for U.S.
Naval Attaches or supervisor of operations against all
attaches in early 1960. He said that Marine Colonel DULACKI's
tact with (or attempt to recruit) the Indonesian KGB agent

fey which he has described in detail (see Page 488)
after he was relieved of these functions.

k. DY to Bulgeria and the LUNT Case

In the spring of 1961, NOSENKO said, four months after
returning fron Cuba, he was told unexpectedly that-in. about —-—
a week's time he would leave for Bulgaria to consult with
the American Department of the Bulgarian MVR concerning
operations against the American Legation in Sofia (Pages
279-283). NOSENKO flew to Sofia in early April 1961, where
he was met by A.S. KO2LOV, an advisor there and a former
employee of the Second Chief Directorate whom NOSENKO had
known at KGB Headquarters. NOSENKO remained in Bulgaria
until about the niddle cf May. While there he discussed
both general matters and particular cases with the Bul-
garians, gave several lectures on operations against Ameri- i
can installations and personnel as well as against tourists, H
and finally directed the successful homosexual operation
against the American Professor LUAT. .

Aside from being told that he would be advising the
Bulgarian service cn operations against Americans at the : a
Legation in Sofia, NOSENKO apparently received no preparar pee
tion for this trip. He said in answer to specific questions
that nobody told him what he was sunposed to discuss with:
the Bulgarians, that he did not meet with the Bulgarian
jiaison representatives in Moscow before leaving, and that
‘i he knew nothing of the organization, personnel, area of
responsibility, o1 problems of the American Department of
the Bulgarian service before arriving in Sofia.

NOSENKO was selected for this mission despite the fact
that he was extremely busy with his duties in the U.S. Embassy
Secticn (see above discussion of his responsibilities for
code clerks, ABIDIAN, and the military attaches) and despite
the fact that KOZLOV was permanently assigned as an advisor
in Sofia. NOSENKO described KOZLOV in another context as a
"very experienced officer" and has said that KOZLOV was. Chief
of the American Departeent until 1953 and then fron June 1955
until sometime in 1958 was Deputy Chief of the Tourist De-
partment, Second Chief Directorate. (KOZLOV, assisted by
KOSENKO, had recruited BURGI in June 1956.) Asked why KOZLOV
could not have advised the Bulgarians, NOSENKO said that he
was too busy advising on higher levels and had been away
from active operations in Moscow too long. .

NOSENKO gave only a general description of his duties
as an advisor on operations against the American Legation.
On the other hand,:he accidentally became involved in a homo-
sexual entrapment operation against an American tourist who
was visiting Bulgaria, and he has described this operation
in considerable detail. (NOSENKO's previous speciality was
} tourist operations, particularly those involving homosexual :
compromise.)

NOSENKO's story about his role in the LUNT case changed
greatly between 1962 and 1964. During the first meeting-
series he described in detail how he set the operation up . i
and what he said to LUST when he personally confronted the {
i

American with the evidence. Since defecting in 1964, how-
ever, NOSENKO has said that he took no personal part in the
approach itself, that he remained in his office, and that he
merely advised how to set it up. (A comparison of his account
and that of LUNT indicates that he was not on the scene at
the time.)

* NOSENKO said that the Bulgarian service hecame a, are
of LUNT's honosexual tendencies only after he saw LUNT's
name or heatdit mentioned; he recognized the name as that..of
a professor who had been assessed as a homosexual when 7
earlier visiting Moscow, and traces with the KOR Second Chick
Directorate confirmed that this was the same man. In state: —
ments rade to U.S. authorities after the approach, LUNT said
he had had hozosexual relations at least five difrerent times
with a Bulgarian during an earlier trip to Sofia. LUNT
gave this Bulgarian travellers’ checks, which the latter
planned to sell cn the biacknarket, *as on one occasion
stepped on the screet with hin by a Yulyarian civil peolice-
man, and corresponded with 5 in the interim between his
first visit and the one during which the arprozch tock place.
LUNT had written » Hudearian hemosexual that he was retprning
to Sofia uefore arriving on the second occasion.

The U.S. Visa and the Cuba Tuy

NOSENKO said that’ in October 1966 he
accompany a delegation of automctive oc ena visit
to the United States but that when this trip > cencelled,
he went on [DY to Cuba (lages 274-278). After he had com-
pleted arrangements for his passport and had submitted his
true name to the U.S. Embassy for a visa, the Soviets were
informed by U.S. authorities that the dclegation could not
then be accepted in the United States. At about the same
tine, a delegation of nickel industry experts was being
readied for departure to Cuba. At first, OSES explained,
it was not considered necessary for a security officer to
acconpany this delegation to a friendly country, but ac the
last ronment, two days before the delegation was scheduled to
leave Moscow, the Central Committee ot the Communist Party
demanded that such an officer go along. Because there was
no time to do otherwise, NCSENKO was chosen for this job
since he already had a valid passport and authorization. to
travel abroad. Visa arrangements were mad? for the transit
countrics and NOSENKO left with the delegation, Teturning to
Moscow in mid- or late Recember 1960.

3 ussizsned to

NOSEXKO's U.S. visa request submitted to the U.S. Em-
bassy in Moscow on 29 October 1960 was his first use of this
name in connection with travel abroad. (He travelted to
England in 1987 and 1958 as NIKOLAYEV, NKO sa because
he had used this name with Eritish citizens
in the Soviet Union; 23 @@M@Me.2, suspected ot g an intel-
ligence officer, NOSENKO was exposed under this identity.

He applied for U.S. entry: under true name, however, despite
the fact that he had also used the NIXOLAYEV naze with
Americans; one of them was FRIPPEL who, according to the
CHEREPANOV papers and one other source, wos suspected by the
KGB to be an American intelligence agent. NCSESKO further
explained that he could not use the name NIKOLAYEV because
the automotive delegation cover he planned to use in the
United States conflicted with the sports/cultural cover he
had used in Great Britain, and the KGB feared that this
would be noticed when the American and British services ex-
changed notes. The proposed automotive cover, however, con-
flicts in the same way with the Ministry ef Foreizn Affairs
cover NOSENKO used, again under true name, in Geneva in 1962.

XOSENKO said that the decision to send him to Cubs
a made two days before the delegation left Moscow because
& security officer was required ard be happened to have @
passport and authorization to travel. The delegation left—
Moscow on 15 November 1960, and therefore “this decision
vas reached on 13 November or thereabouts. NOSENKO, who
had been transferred to the U.S. Embassy. Section in order
to supervise and revitalize operations against code clerks,
the Section‘& most important recruitment target, consequently
left Moscow on the day that MORONE also departed by train
for Warsaw and at a time thet his subordicate KOSOLAPOY was
in Helsinki (12-16 Novenber 1960), apparently in connection
with an operation against John GARLAND.

NOSENKO has given widely divergent accounts of the
purpose of his assignment to Cuba. In 1962 he related in
detail how he had been sent to investigate how the Cuban—
intelligence service was operating against Americans sta-
tioned in Havana, particularly intelligence officers. and
described what he did to fulfill this mission. Since 1964,
however, NOSENKO has claimed merely to have been the security
officer with the delegation.

1. Personal Handlirg of Agents

When NOSENKO transferred from the Tourist Department
to the American Departneot, he took along a number of the
agents he had used in tourist operations with im: YEFREWOV
and VOLKOV, FRIPPEL, DMITRIYEV, and RYTOVA. During this
period he also handled LEVINA, @ Librerian and language
teacher at the U.S, Enbassy who was turned over to him by
U.S. Embassy Section case officer MASSYA in 1960; aod
PREISFREUND end gggumma who were used in code clerk opera
tions. These agents and NOSENKO's handling of thea are dis-
cussed below.

(4) YEFREMOY and _VOLKOV

NOSENKO continued to mect with these t¥o homosexual
sgents during bis two years Deputy Chief of the section.
He did not use ther in any y, however, according to his
gecount. The osly contact of the tzo known to CIA was B
meeting in 1961 with BaRRETT. In 1959, while in Moscow end
a CIS agent, BARRETT was compremised by YEFRENOV and VOLKOY:
in 1961, shortly after ean upparently chance meeting with
then, BARRETT ves recruited by the KGE on the basis of the
materials obtained in 1959. NOSENLO described the compro-
ise cf BARRETT in 1959 and knew that he had bees recruited
in 1961.° He did not know of BARRETT's contacts with YEFRE-
wWOV and VOLKOV in 1961.

(41)  FRIPPEL

NOSENKO said he continued to handle YRIPFEL during the
196u-1961 period, despite the fact that he never provided
anything of value, because he and CHELNOKOV (the Chief of
the Tourist Department who was always present et these
meetings) “kept hoping he would give something." FRIPPEL
left the Sovict Union in January 1961, but NOSENKO continued
to be registered as his case officer.

(iia) DMITRI

DMITRIYEV, a specialist on Jepen and Thailand who
spoke Japanese and English, had teen NOSENKO'S agent during
the 1955-1960 period, DAITRIYEV was then caployed by the
Japanese Exhibition in Moscow, and NOSENKO did not indicate
bow he was used in tourist operations. NOSENXO did not
describe any operational use of hin in 1960 or 1961.

(iv) RYTOVA

RYTOVA was KOSENKO's agent in the Tourist Department
after 1956 or 1957, at which time she was exployed st the
Russian Permanent Exhibit in Moscow. An Engliso speaker,
she reported any interesting information concersing visitors
to the exhibition. NOSENKO has not referred to any KGB opere—
tions in Moscow in which she participated during his service
there. .

As described in Peses 173-131 and discussed above,

and was hacdled be NOSEXKO in the operation against Jancs
STORSBERG, Goth NOSENKO and PREISFREUND said thet this vas
the only operation in which he took part. NOSENKO suggested +
to CIA that PREISFREUND would be able to attest to his busats
description of this case, and CIA interviewed PRELSFREUND

FREUND'e account gencrally agreed with SOSENKO's ond be wag F oma

m. Transfer to the Tourist Department

Some time in the fall of 1961, NOSENKO said, he heard
of GRIBANOV's decision to promote himto the position of
Deputy Chief of the eatire Amcrican Department. NOSENKO, _ ..
however, knew that nis chief and friend KOVSHi% wanted the
job. and that FEDOSEYEV (Chief of the Department) also favored
KOVSHUK for this position. Realizing that his own appoint~
ment would therefore place him in a difficult position and
wighing to avoid this, NOSENKO spoke to the Chief of the
Tourist Department, CHELNOKOV, about returning there. At
CHELNOKOV's suggestion, NOSENKO went to GRIBANOV with the
request to be returned to the Tourist Department as Chief
of-the American Tourist Section, with the understanding that
he would be nade Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department
upon the retirement of the incumbent. BALDIN, in July 1962.
To this GRIBANOY agreed. NOSENKO said that GRIBANOV did
not discuss vith himhis reasons for wanting to appoint him
Deputy Chief of the American Department or for appointing.
him Chief of the American Tourist Section, nor did ne discuss
with NOSENKO his personal requirements for these positions.
On one occasion, in early 1965, NOSENKO said that it was
because GRIBANOV "thought I was a tough guy, a good case
officer. In 1959 I saw him often and was involved in a lot
of questions which were reported to him." According to
his most recent version, NOSENKO was officially transferred
from the American Départment at the end of December 1961
and reported for duty in the Tourist Department on about
3 January 1962.

KOVSHUK, who was also a candidate for the job as Peputy
Chief of the American Department, had earlier held this po-
sition, according to NOSENKO and GOLITSYN. He had been per-
sonally involved in many of the more significant American
Department operations during the previous decade. These in-
cluded the recruitments of RIIODES and SMITH (the latter one
of NOSENKO's most important leads. according to NOSEXKO);
the handling of ‘SHAPIRO; the attempts to recruit STORSBERG,

STONE, -and MANNHEIM; the development of the CIA officer
WINTERS;) acd the interrogation of LANGELLE in connection with
POV arrest.

By contrast, GRIBANOV's original candidate forethe job,
NOSENKO, was present when KOZLOV recruited BURGI, and himself
recruited EARRIS)and five homosexual tourists who visited
the Soviet Union in 1959: Furthermore, NOSENKO's perfor—
mance as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section. as he
admitted under interrogation, was “not good."

NOSENKO has given many contradictory dates for his
transfer to the Tourist Department. In 1962 NOSENKO said
at various times that this took place in January i962 and
in February 1962: in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling
some tine between 15 and 20 January 1962; and in February
1965 he arrived at the date of 2 or 3 January 1962, after
it was pointed out that he appeared in the approach to WEL
JOHNSON on 5 January: (On this basis, he said that the
official order was issued about 25 December 1961 and that
he turned over his files to his successor GRYAZNOV several
days later.) NOSENKO contradicted this latter estimate.
however, by saying that he was in the U.S. Embassy Section
for the entire period of the three-month surveillance of

the Pushkin Street dead drop, t-e-, until late March 1962,
and by his insistence that he had returned to the Tourist
Department by the time GOLITSYN defectud; ho placed this on |
15 January 1962 aad refused to believe the correct date of
15 December 1961. a

p. Remarks sseeretatnetente
For no single responsibility has NOSENKO gubstaotiated
his alleged service as Deputy Chicf of the U.S. Embassy
Section in the years 1960-1961. His statements about the
appointment to and transfer from this position have been
inconsistent; his comparatively narrow experience and his
acknowledged falsehoods about a personal relationship with
the Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, GRIBANOV,
dispel the likelihcod that these personnel assignments were
made in the way he claims. Repeatedly he has becn contra-
dictory about his activities during this two-year period,
shifting his story to suit the occasion and ignoring how
each succeeding version made all of his claiss increasingly
incredible. The limited extent of NOSENKO's information
betrays a lack of familiarity with details on the duties,
targets, and most of the operations which he has ascribed
to hinself; in a certain few instances, however, such as
his description of “ABIDIAN's route to the Pushkin Street dead
drop, he has recounted events just as they are known from
other sources to have occurred. Nevertheless, where col-
lateral information has covered the few subjects on which
he provided details, it has almost invariably contradicted
him and showed him to be ignorant of significant facts.
The reporting by SOSENKO thus was so superficial, so_in-

“complete, and go demonstrably erroneous as to suggest. without

reservation that he never eerved as_an. officer in_the_!
Embassy Séction, much less ag_its Deputy.Chief.. All availe
‘gble evidefice, excluding that from certain Soviets who were
CIA and FBI sources (see Parte VIII.H, and VII.1, below),
combines to formulate this conclusion.

7. Tourist vepartment (1962-1964)
a. Introduction

NOSLNKO ajreed during the interrogations at che beginning
of 1965 that he must have reported for duty as Chief of the
American Tourist Section on about 3 January 1962.* In this
job he was responsible for planning and supervising KGB acti-
vities against all tourists of American, British, and Canadian
nationalities arriving in the USSR, and his duties also encom-
passed preparations for the coming tourist season (Pages 285-
287).

In July 1962, in conformity with GRIbANUV's intentio:
NOSENKO was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of the
entire Tourist Department; it had a table of organization of
close to 100 staff officers, was responsible for handling opera~
tions against all tourists to the Soviet Union, and maintained
the facilities used in these operations. A year later NOSENKO
received the title of First Deputy Chief of the Department, a
“paper” promotion as there was no other deputy. During this
pericd in the Tourist Department, in addition to his supervi-
sory duties {concerning which he has not been questioned in
detail), NOSENKO took personal part in approaches to several
tourists, organized and directed the arrest of an American
tourist on homosexual charges, and met with a number of agents.
It was his serior supervisory position that involved him in two
of the most widely publicized cases of this pericd, the arrest
of BARGHOORN. and the case of OSWALD.

b. Absences from Moscow

During his two years in the Tourist Department, NOSENKO

was availaple to perform his assigned duties only part of the
time. ‘After arriving in the American Tourist Section and after
the approach to JORNSON on 5 January 1962, NOSENKO spent sev-
eral weeks “getting the feel" of things by talking to case offi-
cers, reviewing reports of the section's activities during the

ist season. In mid-February he began preparations for his assign-

ment to Geneva with the Disarmament Delegation, NOSENKO has seusnasseinsee’ Telli

said that this involved discussions with the Eleventh Depart-
ment of the Second Chief Directorate, responsible for arranging
for security coverage of Soviet delegations going abroad, as
well as with the case officers responsible for the investigation
of suspected American agent SHAKHOV. NOSENKO said that he did~
this on a part-time basis in addition to his regular duties,

but has nosed in another context that these preparations required
sufficient time to make it impossible for him to take a personal
part in the recruitment of BIENSTOCK in February 1962. On

15 March 1962, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva, remaining there with
the delegation until 15 June, when he left Geneva by train to
return to Moscow to reassume his duties as Chief of Section.

(He said that he had no deputy chief in this position, and it
is unclear who performed these functions in his absence.) Thus,
according to NOSENKO's account, of the six months he was Chief

¥-Ghis date was settled upon after he acknowledged that his
approach to the American tourist W.E. JOHNSON must have

In the fall of 1962, NOSESKO went on leave for a month in

months of 1963 were spent on variozs temporary assignments in
the soviet Union outside cf Moscow, plus a one-month's vacation
in 1653. From 15 June 1962 to his arrival in Geneva on 19 Janu-
ary 1964, a period of 18 months, NOZENKO was absent from KGS

JOHNSON (Pages 289-293), KO said, was in Moscow as

a tourist in early January 1962. ard was considered for recruit-
ment, but a decision was made thet he was nct worth the efzort
as he had no access to classified aateriais and livei too far
from the KGB Legal Residencies in washington and New York City~
(SCHNSON's home was in Texas.) Severai days after this decr-
sion was made, postal intercepts showed that SCENSON was writing
abusive letters concerning the Soviet Union. They were "so
pitter" and critical that the KGB decided that something had
to be done to stop him, At about the same time the KGB received
an indication that JOHNSON was a romosexual, and it was decided /
to entrap him on this basis and force him to promise not to
write any more letters or criti

use of NOSENKO's homosexual agents, and NOSENKO was able to
describe the confrontation scene, his second meeting with JOHN-
SON, and JOHNSON's frigntened telephone call to the U.S, Enbassy
reporting that NOSENKO had recortacted hin.

NOSENKO told CIA in June 1962 that he had taken part in
this operation “in January." When he contacted CIA in Geneva
in 1964 he had a scrap of paper on which was noted JOHNSON 's
nane and the date "5 January 1962." This was the actual date
of the approach, but NOSENKO insisted that the date bore no
relationship to the name, and that the approach to JOHNSON took

place in the summer of 1962, a fact he recalled distinctly be-
cause he wore no overcoat. It was only when confronted with
official U.S. records that NOSENKO agreed in early 1965 that
the apprcach was in January and recalled that it was made
immediately after NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department.*

NOSENKO said that when JOHNSON first arrived in Moscow
there was consideration of recruiting him, but that there was
a decision against this as he was of little intelligence value.
Then JOHNSON mailed insulting letters which were picked up
through postal intecept. About the same time there were indi-
cations of homosexuality. Then the operation was mounted

‘against him. This implies a very tight time schedule. JOHNSON
arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961; NOSENKO said he reported
for duty as Section Chief on 3 January 1962; JOHNSON reported
his first contact with NOSENKO's homosexual agent VOLKOV the
evening of 4 January; and the approach by NOSENKO was on 5 Janu-

ary.

Although NOSENKO implied in 1962 that his homosexual agents

VYOLKOV and YEFREMOV: were the ones who originally determined

(Grounson "Ss homosexuality, he said in 1964 any that there were
signs. NOSEKKO did not know what these indications were or
where they came from. JOHNSON reported that he first met the
agent VOLKOV on the evening of 4 January when the latter sat
down at his restaurant table; on this same occasion VOLKOV in-
vited JOHNSON to his hotel room the next day. The fact that
VOLKOV joined JOHNSON uninvited anc set him up for the approach
without leaving the table suggests that there had, in fact,
been signs of his homosexuality beforehand and that operational
plans had been laid by this time.

NOSENKO has described the caution taken in other homosexual
entrapment cases and has named several which were called off
because of a risk of scandal. It is, therefore, unusual that
the KGB would take this risk merely to force JOHNSON, an

American and a Baptist minister, to stop writing insulting let-

ters and articles.

NOSENKO did not know why he became involved in this opera-
-. tion the’day after he reported for duty in the senior position
of Section Chief. He said only that BOBKOV, a Deputy Chief of
the Skcond Chief Directorate, told him to do it. During his
talks with JOHNSON, NOSENKO introduced himself to JOHNSON as
*Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV," (rendered by JOHNSON as NIKOLOV)
the “Chief of Police.”

Gimilar to the approach to W.E. JOHNSON: Tt was an operation
in which there wag_no thought of recruitment, and BARGHOOF was
able to identify NOSENKO as a participant.

BARGHOORN reported that the day after his arrest he was
questioned by the same officer who had interrogated him the
evening before abcut the “compromising materials” which had
been planted on h. With this officer on this one occasion
mas his “chief,” whom PARGHOORN subsequently identified by photo-
graph as NOSENKO, NOSENKO has said that he wags told.by the
Chief of the Tourist Department that GRIBANOV wanted him
present in the interrogation room at the time when BARGHOOPN
setea that he had the. conpromising information in his fossea-
sicn at the time cf arrest. NOSENKO did not knew why his pir-
ticular presence was needed or deaircd, tut he complied deszite
the fact that he dic rot want to reveal his face to BARGHOOPN:
as he knew BARGHOORN would be released. NOSENKO said that he
stayed in the interrogation room only yntil the interrogating
officer sccured this adr ission and then he left. BARGHOCRY
has reported that NOSEUKO attended one of the interrogatica
sessions, that thza session covered onty biogrephic and b22«ground
matters, and that the compromising docvments and his possessicn
of them had been discussed the previous evening, right after his
arrest.

In describing the planning of this provecaticn, NOSENKO
told CIA that the suggestion to provide SARGHOOEN came fren

SEMICHASTNYY agreed with the idea of the arrest ard secured
permission to carry it out from BREZHNEV, a5 KHRUSHCHEV was
out of Moscow at the time. Reliable sources show, however,
that KHRUSHCHEV was in Mcscow on 36 October, the day when SzMI~-
CHASTNYY allegedly called BREZHNEV, and was also there on 31
October, the day of the arrest. BREZHNEV was not seen by
Westerners in Moscow from 29 October until 2 November 1963.

iii) The Approach to BRAUNS

NOSENXO said he personally approached the American tour~
ist BRAUNS (Pages 293-295) shortly after returning to Moscow
from Geneva in 1962. BRAUNS had lived in Leningrad until World
War II, had left with the fleeing Germans, and had eventually
settled in the United States, where he was a technician working
at an “interesting company making computers, adding machines,
or other instruments." NOSENKO had originally instructed his

subordinate KRUPNOV to handle the case, but KRUPNOV was not able :
to get anywhere with BRAUNS and in the middle of the approach
called NOSENKO for help. NOSEWKO went to the Moscow Hotel where
KRUPNOV and BRAUNS were talking, and he eventually secured
BRAUNS! agreement to cooperate, against threat of imprisonment
for treason on the bi gs of his wartime flight from the Soviet
t Union. BRAUNS left Moscow the next day for Leningrad, and be-
cause NOSEXKO felt the recruitment was “shaky,” KRUPNOV was”
sent after him to consolidate the agreement. BPAUNS refused
to sce KRUPNOV however, 80 again KOSENKO went to help hin. It
was clear to NOSENKO, however, that Bi was so Frightened
that he would never work for the KGB; STNKO thereupen decided
‘ to terminate the case, and BRAUNS wad sent on his way. a

NOSENKO could not recall his position at the tine he approached
BRAUNS, he did not know why BRAUNS had visited ths Soviet Uv: ’ i
and he was unable to name any Soviet citizeas with whom BeAUN 7
cane into contact while in the USSR. ERAUNS, in fect,.had spent
almost a week in Moscow before the approach was mace. . During
thie time’ he spent his days with an Inturist tour and his even-
ings with an old girlfriend he had knowa tefore the war. She
had been writing to BRAUNS in the United States for about a year,
telling him of her unhappy marriage and ivpendiny divorce.
ERAUNS had written her cf his intention to visit the USSR, asd
che travelled specially from her heme in Leningrad to Moscow to
spend this time with him.

According to the account given by BRAUNS, the man (NOSENKO,
according to NOSENXO) who jeined hin and nis original interrc~
gator in Moscow was the person who first epproached him in Lenin~
grad. This suggests, if correct, that it was NOSENKO who was
sent there to consolidate the recruitment, not K 19%. BRAUNS
wags unable to-identify NOSENKO's photograph but expiained that
he was so frightened that he probably cculd not recognize any
one involved. Other aspects of his story therefore may be con=
fused.

not in face-tce-£ace contact with KOTE! NOSENKO explained that
KOTEN, a member of the CPUSA, had fre ently visited the USSR
since the war, heX numerous suspicicus centacts there, and was
considered possibly to be a “plant” (presumably of the Fal) ir.

the time of his trip to the Soviet Union he was acting as & tour
guide for the New York firm “afton Tours,” which is owned by :
SVENCHANSKIY. (NOSENKO said that SVENCHANSKIY, algo a Communist, i

When NOSENKO transferred from the U.S. Embassy Section to
the Tourist Department, he took with him the two homosexual
agents VOLKOV dnd YEFREMOV, PREISFREUND, BEECABR and PYTOVA
(Pages 287-289). The homosexuals he used the day after his
return, in the operation against W.E. JCHNSON, This was their
first operational use since the fall of 1959; they were never
used again before being terminated at the end of 1962 or eerly i
1963, NOSENKO said, because they were "too well known." PREIS~ :
FREUND was considered compromised to Emerican Inteiligence
following the defection of GOLITSYN, so he also was never used
again, although NOSEKKO met hin socially when PKEISFREUND re~
turned to Moscow on business trips as recently as 1963. During
the first part of 196z, on instructions from KOVSHUK and the i"

the American code clerk. NOSENXO lest saw before going i

was inactive, NOSEZNKO continued to be registered as

er case

(4) PRIPPEL

Having left his assignment in Moscow in early 1961, PRIPPEL
(Pages 129-133 and’ Pary VI11.D.5.) returned several times to
the Soviet Union in 1962 and 1963, NOSENKO, who remained his
case officer although PRIPIEL now lived and worked in New York
City, met him each time. FRIPFEL said there were three such
occasions, in February 1962 when he met once with NOSENKO and
CHELNOKOV in Odessa, and two later times in Moscow and Odessa,
when NOSENKO came alone. NOSENKO denied that he met PRIPPEL
in Odessa in February 1962 with CHELNOKOV, but said that he met
twice with him alone after returning to Moscow from Geneva.
The first of these meetings was in the summer of 1962 when FRIP~
PEL was accompanying a group of American newspaper editors tour~
ing the Soviet Unicn. FRIPPEL gaid NOSENKO called briefly at
his hotel room to enquire what questions ‘the editors planned
to ask KHRUSHCHEV during a planned interview. When FRIPPEL
said he did not know, NOSENKO departed and FRIPPEL later re-
ported that he did not see NOSENKO again on thi: trip. (NOSENKO
gaid he called again after the interview to learn the “reactions”
of the editors.) The second meeting was in Odessa, when FRIPPEL,
visited the Soviet Union as a guide on a tour ship. According
to FRIPPEL, it was on this occasion that NOSENKO apparently made
a phone call to ask permission to go aboard FRIPPEL's ship, and
it might have been at this ‘meeting or the earlier one that
NOSENKO told him something of his personal background. (FRIPPEL
knew a considerable amount of information about NOSENKO's father
and family.) NOSENKO denied the possibility that he would have
to request permission to board the vessel and said that if he
hod tela FRIPPEL anything about himself, it was when! he was
drunk. Both FRIPPEL and NOSENKO agreed that FRIPPEL provided
no information of value during any of these meetings.

(ii) SVENCHANSKIY

NOSENKO has cited SVENCHANSKIY, KGB cryptonym *ANOD,” as
an example of the Second Chief Directorate’s use of foreign
travel agents to signal the KGB when an interesting tourist is
about to visit the Soviet Union (Pages 295-298). SVENCHANSKIY
was recruited for this purpose, NOSENKO said, in 1961 and used
to send open-code signals to the Tourist Department by marking
visa applications whenever he spotted anything significant.
Some of SVENCHANSKIY's »signals had been considered, NOSENKO
said, “of definite operational interest.” In September 1963,
NOSENKO took the case over from the previous handling officer,
NOSKOV, and his name was listed in SVENCHANSKIY'S file as the
responsible officer.

NOSENKO first said that he had read SVENCHANSKIY's file
and then changed this to say that he had only skimmed it. He
met twice with his new agent, once in September 1963 and once
later in the year. On both occasions, NOSKOV was present.

he mignt be an FBI agent. NOSENKO was unable to be more pre~ cH
cise as to the basis for these suspicions and, when asked how i
NOSKOV had resolved them, was able to say only that NOSKOV -
*felt™ that SVENCHANSKLY was not an American agent. ee \

NOSENKO knew little about SVENCHANSKIY's background from

of commercial favors, that he had 2t one tine been detected :
in blackmarket transactions in the USSR, and that in addition 1 :
to his travel agency, SVENCHANSKIY ran a Russian-language book~ i
store in Chicago. PBI and CIA records show that SVENCHANSKIY
has becn erployed by a series of registered Soviet Government {
organizations in the United States since the early 1930's,
that he was released from his position as a United Nations radio
officer broadcasting to the Soviet Union in 1952 when he failed
to answer questions of the Senate Internal Security Committee
concerning alleged subversive activity, and that both his travel
agency and his book store are affiliated with registered Sov- ;
diet agencies, Inturist and Mezhkniga. Allegation; on file of }

Sonya worked for SVENCHANSKIY in New York, but said that she
is not a KGB agent and was not the one who marked the visa
applications.)

e. The OSWALD Investigation

As First Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, NOSENKO
said, he was directiy involved in the investigation of OSWALD'S
i activities in Minsk ‘which was ordered after the assassination
r Of President KENNEDY (Pages 136~144 and Part VIIE.D.5.). It
, is from his role at this time and his reading of the Minsk KGB
file on OSWALD that NCSENKO derived his authority to state that
7 the KGB “washed its hands of OSWALD" after his attempted sui-
\ + cide in the USSR, that there was no attempt to recruit either
- OSWALD or his wife, and that KGB interest in OSWALD while he
i lived in Minsk was restricted to passive observation.

f. The _CHEREPANOV Investigation

Part VIII.5.6.c. contains a discussion of the CHEREPANOV [
case, in which NOSENKO claims to have been involved in Novem-
ber 1962 while Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department.

Leaving aside NOSENKO's unsubstantiated claims to euper~ |

indicated he was absent from KGB Headquarters nearly half of fs
the time, his persoral rose in operations and investigations ‘
of the period appears artificé4l in scone instances and im- t
Llausible others. KOSENKO’s knowledge of the origins of \
the JOHNSON case is incomplete, the timing conflicts with other i
activities attributed to himself, the expressed purpose of
tne compromise in unigue, and the outcoms seems to have little
consequence beyond enabling JOHNSON to confirm that NOSENKO
appeared in it. Although BRAUUS may have been in a position
to corroborate NOSEXKO'S appearance in that operation, he has
rot done so and his statcrents contradict NOSENKO on the part
the latter played. So too do the statements of BARGHOORN, who
recognized NOSENKO as a person who was seen briefly during the
interrogation sessions; certain facts from other sources con~

participation of NOSEXKO in Tourist Department activities has

a unproven that he was in a supervisory position in the KGB or a=

that he was even a case officer.

E. Examination of Other Aspects of NOSENKO's Biography

1. KGB Awards and Ranks

a. Awards

At various times since contacting CIA in 1962, NOSENKO
described a series of awards and decorations which he received
over the years for his performance of duties in the Second Chief
Directorate (Pages 319-321). He claimed to have received the
Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Star, and the Oxder of the
Red Banner; he said he received a special commendation from
KGB Chairman SEROV for nis role in the BURGI recruitment and
the same award in 1959 for his recruitment of all of the Ameri-
can or British tourists recruited that year by the KGB (three
British and three American homosexuals). NOSENKO told of a
number of other commendations which he received--almost one a
year--for his “general good work," In October 1966 NOSENKO
said that he never received any awards for his KGB operational
performance, only a medal for satisfactory completion of 10
years of KGB service and a Red Army anniversary medal.

b. Ranks

NOSENKO'’s descriptions of his various rank promotions fol-
low a similar but more complicated pattern (Pages 322-326).
He has given two separate sets of circumstances for hfs first
promotion, from junior lieutenant to lieutenant. According to
the first of these, the one NOSENKO adhered to during 1964 and
1965, he was promoted to che rank of Lieutenant while serving
in the Far East with the naval GRU at the beginning of 1951.
NOSENKO explained =hat the required time in grade is sometimes
cut in half for cfficers serving at this undesirable post, and
that this is why he was promoted after only six months of
active duty. In 1966 NCSENKO gaid for the first time that he
did rot enter on active duty until March 1951 and that his
promotion to lieutenant was in mid-1952, while stationed in
Sovetsk, on the Baltic. In all his accounts, NOSENKO has said
that he entered the KGB with the rank of lieutenant as this
had been his rank in the naval GRU.*

During his first meetings with CIA in Geneva during 1962
NOSENKO claimed then to be a KGB major and said that he had
already completed the necessary time in grade for a lieutenant
colonelcy. NOSENKO gave an apparently accurate description
of the structure of his salary as a major (so much for rank,

0 much for longevity, etc.) and pointed out that he was fill-
ing a position (Chief of Section) normally held by a lieutenant
colonel. On contacting CIA again in 1964, NOSENKO claimed the
rank of lieutenant colonel. He supported this claim with the
q@pY authorization issved for the CHEREPANOV search,*®. which

See Part VIII.D.2. for a discussion of the likelihood that
NOSENKO served in the naval GRU.

: gave NOSENKO'S rank as lieutenant colone? and was signed by
GRIBANOV himself and testified to it by his signature on the H
“official biographical stetement™ prepared in Frankfurt.

The first major change in NOSENKO's story of his promo-
tiens came during the interrogations of Jenuary 1965 waen he }
volunteered out of context and for no clesr reason that he hed f
never held the rank of major but rather, because of a series t
of administrative slip-ups and GRIBAXOV's advice and help, had f
jumped directly from the rank of captain, which hy received
in 1956, tot rank of lieutenant colonel in Inte 1963.
NOSENKO was later to claim that he had never said in 1962 that
he was a major.*

In. an unsolicited statenent given to CIA April 1966,
NOSENKO wrote that he was only a captain and that the TDY authori-
gation for the CHEREPANOV search had been filled out in error.

Cc. xomarks

NOSENKO's admissions regarding his awards and promotions
directly affect his self-portraiture as a successful and rapidly
rising KGB officer. They also } ne £ the
alleged reasons for this rise :
GRIBAXOV's favoritism. NOSE 3 ¥
BANOV'sS name to each cf the awards he earlier claimed to have
received. In most cases it was GRIBANOV who cecided that
NOSENKO should get a particular award; in the rest, it was
GRIBANOY who physically presented the award to NCSENKO. The
same is true Of NOSENKO's account of his rank premoticns:
GRIBANOV, NOSENKO said, had promised him that he would be pro-
moted Girectly from senior lieutenant to major in 1959; when
the Personnel Department made a mistaxe and ealy promoted
NOSENKO to captain, GRILANOV adviscd hii to accept this rank
and promised that when he had completed sufficier.: tine in grade

pronoted directly to lieutenant colonel. is what happened,
NOSIKKO said in i965, and after he receiv his rank of lieu-
tenant colonel, GRIBANOV called hi E lated him.

On the basis of O's admissivis, there is additional rea-
gon to quegtion his relationship with GRIBANOV.**

NOSENKO carried with him to Geneva, against G3 regulation
and for no reason he could explain, an official KGS docunent
listing Sim as a lievtenant colonel and signed by GRIBANOV him-
self as well as by two provincial euthorities. This suggests
strongly that the’ lie concerning NOSENKO'S rank was not NOSENKO'S
alone. (If, in fact, as pointed out above, the CHEREPANOV
: papers were fabricated by the KGB, then there was no genuine search
as for CHEREPANOY and NOSENKO's document is also fabricated’ and
not a mistake as NOSENKO claims.)

2. Affiliation with Communist Party Organs

a. Introduction

NOSENKO drifted into the Komsomol, he said, in 1943 or
1944 without giving the step any thought whatsoever. All of
his friends at the Baku school were joining, 80 NOSENKO did
too. He remained an indifferent member of this Communist
youth organization throughout his school and university years,
in the GRU, and during his first year as a KGB officer. On
arriving in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Depart-
ment in 1953, NOSEXKO told CIA, he was appointed Secretary of
the small Komsomol Organization of the Second Chief Director~
ate, a group of about 17 members.

b. Discussion

NOSENKO was questioned by DERYABIN on his duties as Kom~
sonol Secretary (Pajes 623) ani, although able to give a super-
ficial account of these functions, was found to be unaware of
certain basic information which DERYABIN felt a person in this
positior should have. Thus, for example, NOSLNXO proviced a
description of the system of levying dues on Kemsomol members
which was substantially incerrect and was unaware that a Kom=
somol Congress (the first in many years and therefere a major
event) had been held during his clained tenure as Secretary.

NOSENKO said that he held the position of Komosmol Organi-
zation Secretary until the late spring or early summer of 1954,
when he got into trouble for naving used official KGB alias
documentation to conceal the fact that he received treatment
for venereal disease contracted from a prostitute. Immediately
after this incident, said NOSENKO, he was removed from nis
position and a “strict reprimand" was placed in his Kom-
sorel file. Several months thereafter, on the eve of his 27th
birthday, NOSENKO was forced out of the Komsomol because he was
too old. For over a year, until January 1956 when NOSENKO was
admitted as a candidate member of the Communist Party of the
Soviet Union, he was the only cfficer in tie KGB who was neither
a Komsonol nor a Party member. NOSINKO's account of his expul-
sion from the Komsc=ol on reaching his 27th birthday is con-
tradicted by the official Statutes of the Komsomol in effect
at that time. These regulations stipulate a meximum age of
25 years and NCSENKO should therefore have been forced out at
the end of October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday. This
was explained to NOSENKO, “ho insisted that he remained a member
until he became 27 years old and that no special exceptions
were made in his case.

c. Remarks

The fact that NOSENKO is incorrect regarding the age limi-
tation makes it doubtful that his account of the venereal
disease incident and his removal from the Komsomol Secretary~
ship is true. The date which he gives to this incident is
after that on which he should have been expelled from the Kom-
somol. (Additionally, NOSENKO's descriptions of the veneral
disease incident, his use of false documents, and his subsequent
punishment by the KGB and the Komsomol have been inconsistent;
see Pages 80-81).

3. Schooling

a. Introduction i

There is relatively little reliable collateral information |
concerning NOSEKO's schooling up until 1950. Other than what
he himself has reported, available information consists of overt!
press releases pertaining to the Minister NOSENKO's career (and.
giving his location at various times) and comments by one KGB
officer and one defector. NOSENKO's own account, together with
references to these other sources, is summarized below.

With the exception of minor variations in dates, attribut-
able to memory, NOSENKO's. story of his early years until the
beginning of World War II, ‘shen he had just completed the sixth
grade in Moscow, has been generally consistent in its various
tellings. Moreover, his accounts of having studied in Lenin-
grad and Moscow agree with information concerning the positions
and movements of the elder NOSENKO during these years. In con-
trast, the pericd immedietely following, during which NOSEKKO
allegedly received his early training in naval matters is char-
acterized with frequent changes of story, contradictions, and
admitted falsehood.

be Discussion

In 1964 and 1965 NOSENKO recalled that he enrolled in the
Moscow special naval school in the summer of 1941, immediately
after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and was evacucted
with the entire school from Moscow to Kuybyshev in September
to begin studies in the seventh crade. (An article in the Sov-
fet Army newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) on 14 Jenuary 1967
confirmed that seven special naval schools were established in
the Soviet Union in April 1940. One of these was in Moscow.
However, to be eligible for admission, one had to have completed!
the seventh grade. The article did not indicate that the Moscow:
school was evacuated.) In April 1966, NOSENXO remembered that
he did not co to Kuybyshey et this time but rather had been
evacuated to Chelyabinsk with his mother and entered the seventh
grade of a regular school.

1964 and 1965 that he returned from Kuybyshev in the sumer of
1942 ard secured admission to the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School, along with which he was evacuated Ly train to Baku in
the fall of that year. In April 1966, after inserting the year
spent at Chelyabinsk with his mother, NOSENKO moved ail events
up a year and wrote in his autobiography that he entered the
Kuybyshev school in the fall of 1942 rather than the fall of j
1941. NCSENKO also wrote at this time that he transferred to |
the Leningrad preparatory school and travelled to Baku in the |
|

!
In keeping with his respective accounts, NOSENKO said in |
{
i

fall of 1943, not 1942.*

* Describing the reasons for his transfer to the Leningrad Naval
Preparatory School, 'OSENKO explained that the Moscow special
naval school was evacuated further to Achinsk in Siberia and [
that this was farther from heme than he wished to go. The i
Red Star article menticned above said that the special naval |
‘schools were all closed in 1943, however. The special school -
apparently therefore was not transferred further to Achinsk, !
but was shut down. :


ane

Tur obUlte

747,

Again to accomuudate the added year in Chelyabinsk, NOSENKO
said in 1966 thet he spent half a year factually, according ty
the rest of the story, about thr2e months) in Baxu before run-
ning away from schocl back to Moscow in January 1944. In
earlier accounte he said he was at the preparatcry school there
from Cctober 1942 until January 1944. Earlier he had also
given expansive and charging accounts of his escape from school
to join the Soviet front against the Germans at Tuapse; now he
admitted thet this was a lie. By cutting the time he was in
Baku from.15 months to about three, KOSENKO also admitted im-
plicitly that his accounts of the basic training he received
in the preparatcry school, of the sumer he spent working at
the school rather than returning to Moscow on vacatica, ard of
his “certainty” that he celebrated his 15th birthday in Baku
were also false.

NOSENKO has been relatively consistent in recounting the
events of 1944, In 1964, 1965 and again in 1966 he told of
studying as an “external” student in Moscow to complete his
ninth year of schooling and of rejoining his classmates from
Baku when the naval preparatory school returnad to Leningrad
in the autumn of 1244. On several occasions during 1964 and
1965, NOSEKXO described how he and his classmates spent Octcber
and November 1944 working in the woods near'Leringrad before
beginning their tenth grade studies late in the year; he omitted
this account from nis April 1966 autobiography.

NOSENKO's account of the next years is similarly marked
with a number of inconsistencies and falsehoods. (In the
latter category he has claimed and later admitted as untrue that
he attended the Frunze aval Academy from 1943 to 1944, that
he was on active miiitary duty until being demobilized in 1945,
and that he wes chct in the hand by a jealous young naval offi-
cer in 1945.) According to the account given under interroga~
tion in April 1964, NOSENKO was shot in the hand at a party in
the end of April 1945, was hospitalized, resigned from the
preparatory school, and received a certificate of satisfactory
Completion of the tenth grade, although ne had been in school
only since November 1944. In 1965 and 1966 NOSENKO said, re-
spectively, that he was shot by a naval officer in February
or March 1945 and chat he shot himself in “early” 1945; since
the 1964 interrogations he has claimed only that he received
a statement of the courses he had attended at the preparatory
school and that he completed the tenth grade at the Shipbuild-
ing Tekhnikum in Leningrad.

The earliest collateral information specifically cuncern-
ing NOSEKKO's educational backgrourc, nears O69 olass, phe

tor ARTAMONOV said he attended 4 naval
preparatory school with NOSFHKO during the period 1944 to 1946.
ARTAMONOV, after NOSENKO's defection was publicized, said he
had known a son of the Minister NOSENKO in the nzvel school in
Leningrad from 1944 to 1946. He was then shown a picture of
NOSENKO and confirmed this was the man. However, according

to NOSEKKO's statements, NOSENKO would have been about two

ew

i


classes behind ART? OV, and would Lave heen at the scacol

for only about two months. It is cenceiveote that the preseace

of the sen of the Minister of Shipruilding woule be widely known

in the school and later remembered. put so would that son's t

self-inflicted wound ard disappearance. «shich ARTAMONOY has not
mertioned. It is unlikely, moreover. that ARTAMONOV could (20

years later) reliably recognize a photo of a person who had been
there such a short tine and not in ARTANONOV's class. (NOSERKO 1
claims not to have known ARTAMONOV nor to recognize the name.)

In all eccounts, including his 1962 statements, NOSENKO
has said that he entered the Institute of International Rela-
tions in Moscow in 1945. His descriptions of courses, events
and friends are as vague and unsubstantial as his accounts of
his earlier schooling. He has given various cates for his
Graduation and has explained that he did so to cover up the
fact that he failed his fini examination in the subject of
"Marxism-Leninism," of which he was ashamed. tOSENKO inost re-

ly ciaimed pas he rt d his eip} the end of the

of 1950 AUER Re.

Ce Remarks

NOSENKO's on admissions, 2° well ag the small amount of
collateral! information available, make it clear thet much of his
gecount uf his education has been false. ‘The reasons for tnis
eee not at all clear and perhaps, in fact, there 4s no logical
explanation. The CIA psychologist who tested and questioned
NCSENKO about his youth suegested that, under conditions of
interrogation, he may lie for ro other rezson other than his
need to save face, This view is an accurate aescription of
NOSEXKO's behavior when questioned in detail on this and other
aspects of his pre-KGE life: it is not 50 with regard to ques-
tioning on his intelligence career. Nor does the psychologist's
view appear to explain way NOSENKO forgot or was unwilling to
tell Cia about an entire year of his life, particularly such a
significant one, after consistently and apparently accurately
(judging from the Soviet press accounts cf the Minister's
activities) describing the years preceding it. It is not
apparent why NOSENKO originally volunteered the story of his
travel to Baku in the fall of 1942, when this was untrte, Or i
why he said that the Moscow Special Naval School was evacuated
to Achinsk in 1943, when he must be aware that the school was
closed, if he was there.*

eee,

* "The possibility that NOSENKO is not the person he claims
to be (and with a completely false life history, or one
lived ky someone else) has been examined carefully, but
no clear conclusion can be drawn or the basis of available
evidence.

3. Motivation

Part of one's uotivation for such a drastic act as
treason or defection may not be wholly conscious, and there
may be underlying causes which any source might not went
or be able to admit even to hinself. Thus, what NOSENKO
said about motivation need not be teken at face value, and
for this reason the whole question of his aativation must
remain a minor weight in the overall assessment of bona fides.

NOSENKO hag tried to present a meaningful explacatioa
and has changed or adjusted his story to this end. He
initially insisted that he had no ideological motives but
simply wanted to “make a deal" in order to get out of
trouble; yet thisclaim is open to question: The amount of
operational money which NOSENKO needed to replace was hardly
enough to have driven him to treason, especially since
there were friends in Geneva like GUK and KISLOV who might
have helped him make up his loss. Furthersore, only two
days after CIA had rescued him with funds, NOSESKO
“spent the CTA goncy in another drunken debauchery (with the
Same companion) and cane back needing The discre-
pancy between the degree of the need and the seriousness of
of the act was so evident that the CIA case officer commented zs
to NOSEXKO at the outset that there must be some deeper
explanation for his act. Thereupon NOSENKO added new
reasons: His distaste for certain aspects of the regize,
his resentment of KHRUSHCHEY, aad nis liking for Americans.

By his defection ic 1964 NOSENKO changed the course of
his life, although he had said in 1962, forcefully aad
unequivocally, that he would never do so unless in acute
danger. In 1964 he could give no coherent explanaticn for
the change of heart and in October 1966 he denied, for the
first time, that/hehad said in 1962 that he would not de~
fect. His only motivation was that, having risen to the
level of Deputy Department Chief, he would not get to travel
abroad any more. (This contradicts NCSENKO's 1962 state-~
ments: anticipating imminent prozotion to Deputy Department
Chief, he said that he would Ieave the USSR at least once
a year in the future.) For no visible reason NOSENKO seems
to have abandoned a purportedly successful and promising
career, an undisturbed family life and children of shom
he was fond, cast shame on his father's menory sud his re~
maining relatives, and departed forever from his own country.

His own unease concerning his motivation evidently con—
tinued until, in 1965, he wrote one cohesive explasation.
No part of this statement was ever borne out by his conduct,
attitudes, remarks or reactions. He appeared, wherever his
reactions seemed spontaneous, to dislike the United States,
to have no interest in it politically, culturally, or
scenically, and to preserve 5 preference for the USSR. A
CIA graphologist commented on XOSENKO's “strong esotional
ties to his traditionel background," while @ CIA psycholo~
gist reported: "Emotionally he has not defected in spite
of his attempt to intellectually rationalize that he has."
The psychologist also said that it is “almost impossible to
determine his true loyalties and true beliefs.”

4. Operational Circumstances
&. Presence in Geneva (1962)

2952

When he came to Geneva in mid-March 1962,;-NOSENKO
was a newly appointed Section Chief in the KGB Second Chief
Directorate, bavirg held this position for to months.
He binself acknowledged to CIA that it eppeared strerze
for the KGB to send a new Section Chief on an extended trip
abroad unconrected with his on work. His reasons for being
in Geneva have varicd and to some degree contradict one
snother: The Disarnancnt Conference was not expected to
last more then few seeks, but NOSENKO did not begin his
work egainst SHAKHOV (one of the main reasons for sis being
there) until six weeks after arrival; GRISANOV played a
role in his TDY, but NUSZiXO Tater dented this; tkere sere
in 1962 “new reles" requiring & staff officer to accompany
a Sovict delegetion, but in 1965 SOSEMKO said he did not
renenber such regulations. He was pernitted to go to Geneva
in 1962 and 1964, as well es to Cuba in 1950 and Fr¢land
in 1957 and 1958, under no supervision or restraint cespite
his claim to a record so bad thac he was not clearcd by the
KGB for persancnt posting to Ethiopia in 1960.

bd. Fresence in Geneva (1964)

NUSENKO said om one occasion that GRIBANOY was cne of
those who allowed him to come to Geneva in January 1964,
as a personal favor;* he later not only denied this but said
in 1965 that GRIBANOV knew acthing about the ThY. He re-
ported the 19G4 TDY might, because of his new position,
be his last trip to the West, hence the “favor” of his
superiors to permit hio this last trip; in 1962 NOSENKO
said he had the assurance thet as Deputy Lepartment Chief
(which he knew he was about to tecome) he would in the future
cone to the fest at least once a year. Also, NOSENKO could
not explain why a First Deputy Department Chief, if allowed
out of the USSR as e “treat.” would go abroad for a conference
which could be expected to last many weexs, probably months.
This question 1s compounded by the fact that NOSENEO would
be needed in Moscow: He said that a KGS conference to plan
the handling of the tourist season was to be held at about
this time, and he stuck to this story even aiter admitting
that the telegras recalling him for this Moscow conference
was an invention (sec below).

c. Access to KGB Residency and Availability to CIA

NOSENKO in 1962 routinely visited the KGB Legal Resit—
dency in Geneva every weekday mornirg, although he claimed
that he had ne reason and that it is noreally forbidden (as
other sources hive confirmed).** When aéked how end vny he

London more than once during his visits there in a similar
ph ee in 1957 and 1958, nor during his trap te Cuba in
960.

did so ip Geneva, NOSENKO has given differect ansvers at
different times. His stories of simply “dropping in and
hangirg aroucd" for lack of anything better to co are
upacceptable in terms of known or likely Soviet practice.
His explanation that it was due to TSYMBAL's auspices or

or intervention were contradicted by: First, his ovr con-
fused accounts of his relationship with TSYMBAL; and second,
his own statements at other tizes that it was GUK who vas
primarily responsible for NOSENKO's visits to the Residency.

NOSENKO had a full day free for meetings on 11 June

2
1962, although thereafter he limited meeting tines to shortes We

and shorter periods until his departure, This seemed

natural at the time since he would presumably huve his own
responsibilities and would need to be seen by nis Soviet
colleagues ia his proper surroundings. However, in 1964

he seened not to save any official responsibilit‘es or any
calls on his time: He was willing to spend all his time in
mectings with CIA, Although this could be explained by the
fact that he planned to defect a y, it nevertheless gould
have favolved unnecessary risks to a genuine source about

to becone a defector. Ho showed no concern at the time,

but later (in 1966), he said that he had been in fact efraid;
it was for this reason that he invented the Moscow recall
telegram, in order to hasten ais defection and put an end

to his fears of getting caught. It is, of course, impossible
to make conclusive judgments on Soviet practice, but one
would expect, 1f NOSENKO were not engaged in security duties,
that he would be required to participate for cover reasons

in more of the Sovict delegation‘'s official activity. He
said that any absence could be explained as “security duties,"
since everyone on the Soviet Delegation knew or suspected
that he was a KGB officer. This unconcern for tke suspicions
of other Soviets conforms neither with obsérved Soviet
practice nor with reports from other sources that Soviet
intelligence and security officers under cover go to some
pains to hide their true affiliation.

NOSENKO explained the contrast betveen his freedom
and availability in 1964 and his limited free tine in 1962
by the fact that in 1964 he had no personal friends in
Geneva; in 1962 both GUK and KISLOV expected to see him io
his free time. (This story does not explain his ability ip -
1964 to get away during conference working hours; neither
GUE nor KISLOV affected this in 1962.)

4. Timing of .1962 Contact

NOSENKO had been in Geseva for three months in 1962
when the incident which brought him to CIA occurred; it
was only two weeks before his departure. He came to David
WARK only 10 days before leaving. This had the effect of
limiting CIA's time with him. NOSENKO's contact came only
about 10 days after CIA had completed, in the same city, @
serics of meetings with BKELITSKIY, a Soviet interpreter who
hed been recruited and handled as an agent by CIA during
earlier visits to the West. NOSENKO, as one of the two
primary items he wanted to “sell” revealed thet BELITSKIY
had been under KGB control from the outset (Page 517).

e. Willinoness to Meet CIA

Although in 1962 NOSENKO claimed that he wanted to

sell only two specific items for the money he had lost, and
then disappear, there were indications from the outset that
he expected and planned to come back for further meetings
with CIA. At tnis first meeting he called attention to
certain information in his possession about POPOV, hinting :
that he would teil it later; even as he protested his unwilling-
ness to continue meeting with CIA, he was giving ample
detaiis about himself which would inevitably have compro~
mised him to CIA and forced his future ccllakoration. Before
he finally agreed to return for more meetings, he said:
“Mayte I'l] meet you again Monday* (two days after the first

E meeting). NOSENKO refused, despite repeated inducerents,

‘ to meet on the intervening Sunday. in fact, wren he did
return on Monday, ne said that he had spest Sunday with

friends, drinking and “discussing recent USSR foreign policy

moves and spceches by KHRUSICHEV." Fi

The operational circumstances so far reviewed point

stating his reasons for being in Geneva in 1962 and
1964;

e

- He had unusual access to the KGP Legal Residency
and an availability for meeting CIA that seemed to
impinge upon his security;

- He was willing to return to meetings with CIA al-
though having at first said that there were but two
iters of information for sale;

six of his 100 or so days in Geneva in 1962, thus

754. H

Taken together, theso fects suggest the possibilities
that the KGB sent NOSENKO to Geneva on toth occesions for
the purpose of contacting CIA, that the KGB wanted the
opportunity to gauge CIA‘’s reactions to the walk-in ip 1962
and to the defection plans in 1964, end that the KGB guid. d
ROSENKO after contact was established in both years

A further examination of the operational circumstances
in Geneva lends credence to these possibilities. During the
1962 meetings. NOSENKO would frequently answer CIA questions
by saying: “I will have to think about that tonight,“ or
“] wiil have some time tonight to jot down and prepare &
good answer for you," or "I don‘t zant to give you an answer
to that right off--I om afreid to mislead you." He would
return to a later meeting with the inforuation, after having
visited the Legal Residency. In 1964 there were other
exazples of what may have been backstage guidance by the
KGB: ‘i

-le called for an urgent special meeting to cor-
rect sumething he had said in an earlier meeting.
Initially KOSENKO had nemed ZUJUS instead of KEYSERS
as the U.S. Embassy code clerk whom he had personally
approached in 1961. This seeued remarkably urgent and
important to him at the time. and in retrospect this
case gains special importance: It was the only time
he claimed to have had direct contact with # U.S.
Embessy staff employee during hig alleged tour in the
American Department in 19C0-1961. If he could not
remember this one name, it might call his entire story
into question, It is herd to find snother explanation;
had he simply made a careless mistake, with his cus-
tomary indifference to names and dates, XOSENKO would
be unlikely to mull over what he hed said et the meeting
nor to bother about correcting @ minor misstatement.
Much less would he feel compelled to cell an emergency
meeting to do 50.

~He came to meetings with “chance” items picked
up at the Legal Residency, esch of which would require
quick action and the commitme: of assets on the part
of CIA in Geneva. Also, NOSENKO originally said in
January 1964 that be wanted to defect right away, but
various steps taken or planned by his CIA handlers
kept him in place for a time. Each step, however. was
quickly negated--usually at the next meeting--by some
information NOSFNKO had picked up by chance.

~He asked, out of context and without any explene-
tion, whether GOLITSYN had told CIA that the President
of Finland was a Soviet agent, and later could not
coherently explain where he had heard this, why he had
not told CIA about it in 1962, and why he had asked.

In addition, the Soviet reactions to the defection were
unprecedented and contrasted sharply with, for example, the
Soviets’ avoidance of publicity concerning GOLITSYN's defec~
tion in 1961. The post-defection actions by the Soviet
Government created publicity which had the superficial effect
of underlining NOSENKO's authenticity, establishing him es
@ public figure, confirming that he had a family, and veri-
fying that his defection was of alarming consequence. These

reactions seem purposeful in light of the approach in Paris
in 1966 of a Soviet photographer to Paria Match; the photo~
grapher passed photographs of NOSENKO'S wife and children
as part of a proposed story to dramatize the abandoned
fanily of a “top Soviet intelligence officer" whose cefec-
tion had caused the "biggest blow ever suffered by Soviet
Intelligence.“ There is no independent press in the USSR,
no Soviet journalist’Allowed to publish as he pleases, and
the Soviet Government in the past has shown no predisposi-
tion to dramatize defections from its most secret agency.

The photographer can only be presumed to have been acting on

KGB instructions.

H. Alternative Explanations
1. | Introduction

“parts VIII.B. through VIII.P. have discussed the
inaccuracies, self-admitted contradictions, inconsistencies,
and incompleteness of NOSENKO's reporting about himself and
the KGB. Collectively, these important flaws in the story
of and by NOSENKO make it necessary to choose an explanation
for his actions and the nature of his information. There
are three alternatives:

Pirst, NOSENKO was a KGB officer but (a) has
a faulty or selective memory, has embellished or
boasted, or his reporting has been influenced by a
combination thereof; or (b) he is insane.

Second, NOSENKO lied about himself in order to
save face. :

Third, NOSEKKO has misrepresented himself, either
on his own or at the instigation of the KGB.

Each of these mutually exclusive alternatives is discussed
below.

2. First Alternative

According to one postulate, NOSENKO was an officer in
the KGB but has a faulty memory, has a selective memory,
and/or has embellished or boasted:

a. Faulty Memory

NOSENKO himself has repeatedly appealed for understanding
that “different pecple have different memories" and that
his own is “funny,” and this is supported by his forgetful-
ness and errors concerning events he is kn inderendently
to have lived through, uuch as the BURGI and RESEEEB casos.
But it cannot be said that he is, in general, “very bad with
names," because he nas almost total recail of names and
positions of hundreds of KGB officers in the American and
Tourist Departments. He has a good memory for teces and
rarely failed to recognize photcgraphs of people he claimed
to know. He remem&ered consistently details about certain
operations (the compromise and investiga~1on of PENKOVSKIY,
the surveillance of ABIDIAN to Pushkin Street, the JENNER
case, the arrest of BARGHOORN, and the search for CHEREPANOV,
to cite a few examples). NUSENKO was precisely accurate in
his recollection of most of his dealings with CIA personnel
from June 1962 onward.

b. Selective Memory

Although having a selective memory is probably true of
nearly everyone, a CIA psychologist has described NOSENKO as
@ psychopath who would register each passing event only in
relation to its effect on himself at that moment. This
would inevitably make him indifferent to the characteristics
of other people, for example, and to the sequence in which
events transpired; the aspects important to him might rot
appear so to a more objective observer. Such a person would

- > SECRET,

bo
Scaa woaee~ +


760,

euppress unpleasant memorics and would have no real appre-
ciation of or respoct for an “objective truth." His re-
porting, like his perception and his memory, might therefore
geem distorted, He right recount events according to his
mood of the monent. Thus, fo- example, if real attachments
to family or friends is irpossible for & psychopath, there
be an explanation as to why NOSENKO cannot easily remember
his childrens’ birthdays, why in 1962 (or 1965) he appears
to have lied--or been indifferent to the truth--about his
older daughter's schooling, and why he cannot recall when
he first married. In theory this hypothesis can explain
any aberration, since it involves the unknowable, In its
most extreme form, by describing NOSENKO as one unable to
discriminate between fact and fancy, it would encompass and
explain away the facts that his story is obviously untrue
and contradictory in major ways; that his uccount of his
personal and professional lite and his rendition of the
information he knows are so vague and unsubstantial; that
he cannot (and/or does not care to) remember or recount
how he did the things he did, Most important, it woula
dismiss any conclusions based on NOSENKO's testimony siace
nothing NOSENKO said could be taken seriously, This hypo-
thesis, however, is unsupportable because of several
factors.

First, NOSENKO clains|| [that
he quickly rose to high supervisory responsibility Im 8
counterintelligence organization which is known to require
attention to detail. He would have riseo in the KGB while”
overcoming the black marks in his file: scandal, indiscip-
line, negative background factors, and bad Party record.
NOSENKO admits that his performance was not good; he was
inattentive and inactive and almost none of his operational
activity was carried out unaccompanied. That his rise re~
sulted from his father's influence or GRIBANOV's is unten=
able, for his father died in 1956 and GRIBANOV's patronage
(itself open to the strongest doubt) would not and could not
be dispensed upon such a mental case. Mental aberration to
the degree which would explain his poor performance under
CIA interrogation would necessarily have hindered his per~
formance of KGB duties, denied him special privileges, and
and hence cost him the career which NOSENKO has clained for
himself.

A second factor negating this hypothesis of a psycho=

pathic personality is that such @ person could be induced

to recall certain details with the help of discussion,
questioning, and reminders, whereas NOSENKO's vague and hazy
reports seem to represent the ebsolute limits of his memory
or knowledge. Years of questioning have not succeeded in
dredging up any new details or incidents. Even when reminded,
be could not recall, for example, one of KOSOLAPOV's TDYs to
Helsinki, the details of the seizure of electronic equipment
from the U.S. Arny Attaches at Stalingrad, the correct date
of GOLITSYN's defection, or the presence of KHRUSHCHEY in
Moscow at the time of the decision to arrest BARGHOORN,

Another factor is the impossibility of applying this
hypothesis to the totality of NOSENKO's reporting. If the
bypothesis holds that some things are important to him and
others are not, and that he therefore remembers the former
and forgeta the latter, it is refuted by the inability ‘o-

find a category of information aboyt himself which he con-
Gisteatly remeabored nur aay that he consistently forgot.

¥ what is important is his cwn direct experiences, for "
example, it is odd that he recétled the operations of others
better than his own; he remembered the names of hundreds of
KGB officers, but could not recall names of his own agents :
and people involved in his own career; he could recount
details of the PENKOVSKIY investigation, in which he did

not participate, but not of the discovery of American spices
among tourists, such as NcGOWAN, for which he was responsible;
he remenbered details of the 1955 MALIA case in which he

did not meet the target personally but forgot details of the
1961 KEYSERS case in which he did. If it is the importance

to him of recruitment operations against U.S, Embassy em-
Ployees which permitted him to recall sone details of the
STORSBERG and MULE operations, it is not important enough

to help him recall some of the other details which were
equally pertinent to nim personally; and it ts not selective
memory which made him forget almost every detail about CLA
personne] in Moscow and KCB action against them. If it is
said that his parental faniiy 1s important to him ( hence

his memory of his father's funeral and the names of his

ureles and aunts), it is odd that he cannot recall details
about his childhood. If drinking with important people is
meaningful to him, it would explain why he remembers one
GRIBANOY evening with sharp clarity, but it does not explain
why he cannot remember the other two times, not even in what
season of the year or in what restauratt they took place.

Finally, with reference to the “selective memory" hypo~
thesis, it is precisely in matters NOSENKO said he remembers
best and which he told most confidently that the majority of
inexplicable contradictions arise. Nothing could shake him
from his claim to have been directly responsible for ABIDIAN
or on his story of the Pushkin Street dead drop, among
numerous examples.

ec. Embellishment

The third possibility is that he has simply embellished
and boasted, while underlying his story is a core of truth
somewhere near what he has reported. NOSENXO has, after all,
admitted many “white lies" and boasts ("painting™ himself, as
he called it). Also, in the interrogations there were
repeated signs that he was fabricating and improvising, often
in ways which led him into more contradictions and further
admissions of white lies. Perhaps then, according to this
hypothesis, he simply invented, on his own, various aspects
of his career. Perhaps he dated his entry into the KGB
earlier to make himself seem more experienced, and invented

“his service in the American Department to make himself more

interesting to American Intelligence. Perhaps he was only
a principal agent, not a staff officer, but learned enough
from his operations and from his handlers to think he could
pose as one. This hypothesis would certainly explain many
of the dubious aspects: ‘the story of his career, his lack
of information on KGB staff procedures, his ignorance of
major KGB events and scurces, the degree of his relationship
with GRIBANOV, etc. This theory, however, founders on &

individual theories, It cannot explain the counterarguzents
discussed under corponent parts above.

e. Insaaity

It might ve postulated that NOS: O went in
this ves the cavse not oaly of his seesingly unmotivated
contact with CIA in 1962 but of shortconings in his story.
However, NOSZNKXO thereafter pendled senior NGB functions
vell enough to be promoted aru to be .perritted abroad in
1964; he has deca extuined pericdically by a CIA psyctolo-
gist and a CIA psychiatrist; he has teen in contact over
considerable periods of tine and under veryirg degrees of
stress with experienced CIA and FRL persennel; he has aaine
tained his equilibriun under difficult circunstances. Nore
of the foregoing results in an indication of {nsanity and
there are countless other ergunents which would invalicate

this hypothesis.

(3. Second Alternative

It has also been postulated that NOSEXKO is a psycho~
path, is what he says he is, but that ror psychological
reasons ond while under interrogation, he did net want to
tell what he knew. By this Jane of reasoning, NOSENKO has
lied for no other reason than to save face; by dwelling on
the inconsistencies in NOSENKO's statements, the interro~
gator ncrely caused nore inconsistescies or else received
the false answers tnat NOSENKO did not know or did not re-
menber the facts.  Uncer interrogation, however, NOSENKO
recalled ard repeated what he had previousiy said in the
Jess inhibiting atzusphere of the relaxed debricfings prior
to 4 Aprii 1964. This alternative explanation
thus does aot account for the factual contradictions in
NOSENKO's reporting before the interrogations, such as the
errors in dates, in soureing on the NDREY" case, in de-
tails about the Pushkin 5 scot dead drop, etc. It also
fails to account for KOSENK)'s retractions about his rank 8s

rization which shows hin to be a lieutenant colonel, aad

4. Third Alterzative

The only other postulate is that NOSENKO is not what
he claims to be, in which case his nisrepresentation was
done either on his own or as part of a KGB operation.

if he is misrepresenting himself on his own, there sre
(even in theory) only two possibilities: He is merely exage~
gerating (discussed above, under the "First Alternative") or

he is a fabricator. He cannot be 8 fabricator, however, since

the Soviets have certified him in sany ways; includirg his”

764,

There remains the possibility that NOSENKO has misrep-
resented himself and is a witting part of a KGB operation. This
hypothesis could accormodate the argument that the RGB would
not dispatch a KGB staff officer as a double agent against a
hostile service because, whether or not the argument is valid,
NOSENKO (as indicated in Part VIII.D. above) has not proven his
claim to having served as an officer of the KGB. If he has
been and is now under KGB control, it would appear that he was
being built up for years to look like an officer and was shown
to Westerners in certain recruitment operations.* This could
explain NOSENKO's revelations to.FRIPPEL and others about his
family and background; the otherwise pointless W.E, JOHNSON
case, and NOSENKO's appezrance in the BARGHOORN interrogation.
It could explain NOSEIKO's uneven memory and performance under
detailed questionirg: Much of what he should have known by
personal experience could have been merely memorized as part
et his KG briefing. Nothing sn NOSENKO'S production (see
Part VII1.B. above) would preclude his being a KGS-dispatched
agent. That he was a KGS-dispatcheé agent was the cor lusion
independently arrived at by the CIA spec alist who administered
a polygraph examination to NCSENKO in Apr 1964.

4. Pemarks

The first alternative above has been rejected while the
possibility that NOSENKO on his own misrepresented himself
fs unacceptable. The remaining possibility is that NOSENKO
has been manipulated by the KGS in an operation directed
against American Intelligence.

¥ "His American Department service in 1960-1961 was not supported
by any such "show" appearances--he did not insist on the
truth of his claim-to participation in the KEYSERS case,
which, moreover KEYSERS ¢o t confirm; PREISFPEUND is an
unreliable witness; and. .is not accessible to
interview.

1, Sunsary of Conc Lusions

CIA has considered every major aspect of the NOSENKO
case for the perpose of reaching 8 definitive corelusion
about the bone fides of this zap aho says he is a KGB
officer-derector Tollaberating with Anerican Intelligence.

As this point-by-point analysis has denonstrated,
there is no reason to accept any of NOSENKO'S claina to
a career as an officer in Soviet Intelligence, to authority
concerning the range and degrec of KGB operational successes
in the USSR (particularly with U.S, offictals and private
citizens), to accurate krowledse regarding major security
cases in that country, or to cooperation with Arerican Intel-

ligence.

yt would be sufficient proof of his mala fides to
verify that NOSENKO lied about A single segment OF his

officer status in the EGB, providing incomplete ard inaccu=
rate information on his sub-sources and on such topics as

rents on modus operandi. Neither a supervisor nor, prow
bably, a case ‘oTTicer, it remains dubious put possible that
he wes a KGB principal agent whose speciality to the past
yas coupronising western homosexuals. Shatever the capacity
in which NOSENXO served, it was not in the KGB ranss, holding
the KGB titles, or with the KGB honors he has ascribed to
hirself, ard this fact is enough to prove the falsity of
his claims to being 3 genuine defector.

There is no question, hovever, that NOSENKG has had

In assessing whether and how

defected, 1t is necessary to consider the ways tm which the KGB
might heave create? and supported a legend for a counterfeit KCB
officer-cefector like NOSEXKO. ‘the *GB might have accorplished
this by the following mears:

~ NOSENKO's legend would have required the KCB to
brief tim in depth on mune:ous cases and various turgets
which he would be Ye to discuss wi iA. Tne KGB
would also have to aliar:ze nim with KSE staff organi-
ational structure and pruced .t** ed KGB officers

EA!OV) so that he coulag noc only recognize their
noLogr apt also ler? reality co his remarks atout
them. NO. 0 would also have vo visit KG3 installations
and other 2reas which appeared in his legend.

estat these preparations were imperfect, cz at least that
NOSENKO imperfectly mastered his briefing, was shown in
his performance under interrogation.

The NUSENKU case hus not been discussed with GOLITSYU since

the 29 dune 1964 intervieds thus he hss not ‘een questioned

further on the circumstunces which led to the encounters with

HOSENKO described by him, nor have the results of subsequent
detailed reinterrogations of NOSENKO - discussed at length in
the foregoing sections of this poper - been made available to
him for review, analysis, or comment.

2. Resume _and Discussion of _Infermation*

American Department - 1953
NUSENKO has said that he entered the KGB in arch 1953**

and was first assiqned to the U.S. Embassy Section of the American

Department of what js now the Second Chief Directorate, KGB. He
stetad that his duties from hida entry until sometime in 1954, per-
haps about June, were to work on files of american correspondents

on permanent assignment to “osco# and to meet with the Soviet
citizens who were agents or informants reporting on the corres-
pondents to the KGB. :
GOLITSM stated that he met NOSENKO in the émerican Depart-
ment of the Internal Counter intelligence Directorate***® a couple
of times in 1953 when he, COLITSYN, was there on other matters.

GOLITSYN had earlier identified his ow job between ‘becember

1952 and April 1953 a3 Chief of the american Sector, Counter-

intelligence (Ninth) Department, Foreign Directorate, under the
Chief Intelligence Directorate (formed in December 1952 and re-
organized in april 1953). From April 1953 until his departure

s—qhe relationship between the reporting by GOLITSYN and NOSENXO

on specific operations is shown on Pages 593-595, with comments
thereon appearing on Pages 647-659, while in this section are

a discussion and an evaluation of what GCLITSYN said about

NOSENKU's assignments in the Second Chief Directorate (see

Pages 343-344)~

for Vienna in Uctober 1953 GULITS ‘was Deputy Chief of “the

Emicre Sector, Counterintellicence vepartment, Foreign Intzlligenc?
Department, Foreign Intelligence Directorate. GOLITSYN has not
indicated the nature of his responsibilities in either of these
positions which would have necessit3ted his visiting the American
Department of the Internal Counterintelligence Directorate, although
certain activities of cormon interest with the latter would appear
logical. NOSEKO's description of his alleged duties with corres-
pondents, however, did not encompass his having official contacts
with representatives of any component of the Counterintelligenc?
Department of the Foreign Directorate. According to NOSEYKO'?
description of the location of his claimed office in the American
Department, and his description of the duties of the co-worzxers

he said shared it with hin, chance contecta there with such 4

representative would have been*precluded. Even by NOSRIKO's account,

then, an encounter between GOLITSYN and himself could not have
been in the course of interdepartmental Liaison between their
respective units, nor could it have occurred in NOSEIKO's office.
GOLITSY%'s lack of reporting on KCB operations against American
correspondents (other than his conversation with KOVSHUK in 1956
or 1957 about Henry SHAPIRO) is further evidence that his business
: in the American Department was unrelated to NCSENKO's claimed
Activities at that time, and GOLITSYN's own statement on the 1953
encounters implied that his meetings with NOSENKO were accidental.
Pleeting as their contacts would therefore have been, it could
have led GULITSYN to make the unfounded assumption that NOSENKO ©
was a member of the staff within the american Department.
merican Cepartment/Tourist Department - 1955-1960
BOSEXKO stated that he transferred from the American Depart-

ment to the Tourist Department in June 1955, and remained in the
Tourist Departmant until 1960, becoming a deputy chief of section
there in 1958.

GOLITSYH, however, insisted that NOSEXKO remained in the
American Department until at least 1957, or possibly as late as
"1958. GOLITSYN added that the KGB would not be aware thst he knew |

<7 Top SECRET



TOP SECRET

HOsEKU's true position in the american Depsctnent in 1957 or
195@. GOLITSM dia not ind:cete how he acquired his knowledge
on this nor why the KGB subsequently would have vean unable to
determone thst ne hid. If nis access to this information was in-
decd that remote (as GULITS“I's assignment ia 1957 and 1958 ould
indicate - see below), it is readily apparent that it could liko- ,,
Wise be sonewhut garbled. COLIT3VN was unable to explain the ie
fact thst NOSEXKO's physical presence in exclusively Tourist
Department cases had been yositively established through photo
Jaentifications made by several of the individuals “tnvolved, who
met NOSENKO as early as 1956.

From 1955 to 1959 (the same years when NOSEIKO claimed to
have becn in the Tourist Oejartment) GOLITSYN was enrolled in
the KCB Higher School. Ke was detached from the school, jn the
period January-tarch 1959, in order to gether material for his
thesis. At that time GOLITS@ spent just under two months in
the Tourist Department,* but GOLITSYN's work did not involve hia
in any day-to-day operational activities of this department. He
has reported having “occasionally” met NOSENKO in 1959; although
he did not specify that it was at precisely this time, it seems
probable that it would have been. GOLITSYN said that he asked
NOSENKO in 1959 where he wes working and NOSENKO told him the
Tourist Department. Again it appears from this that his encounters
must have been brief, superficial, and not work-related, hence
insufficient for GOLITSYN to arrive independently at a well-founded
conclusion as to NOSENKO's sctual status and function with the

Tourist Department.

im describing his om and others’ responsibilities in the Tcurist
Department, NOSE%KO has made no reference es this unit having a
formal or regular relationship with the KGB school or to students
from the school having Leen detached to the department.

Tho detutled interrogations of NOSENKG cofgernina his claims

to KGB positions between 1953 and 1964, did not toke plaice until
hany months after CULITSYd made his apatereant a, and they were based |
upon all collaters] information knowprélaeing to each phase. None Hl
of the results of these interrogations was made available to
GOLITS'N, so he was not aware of the countless prints on which
NOSEXKO contradicted known facts and revealed his ignorance of
activities Which were carried out by the KGB during his alleged

tenure in the eportments. .

3. Comments on GOLITSYN ie
Several factors influence the evaluation of COLITSYN's states
ments on ROSENKOs

- First, as stoted in Part VIII.I., it is concluded
that NOSENKO did not serve in the KG3 positions he claimed.
GOLITSY's testimony verified this conclusion insofar as
NOSENKO's claims about service in the U.S. Embassy Section
of the American Department in 1960-1961 are concerned. hore-
over, in 1962 GOLITSYN concluded that the KGB “letter-writer”
(actually NOSEMKO) was under KGB control in submitting infor- |
mation to american Intelligence. At issue. therefore, is the
evidence from GOLITSYN to the effect that NOSENKO was an
officer in the smerican Department (until 1957 or 1958, ‘vheress
NoSaiKG said he was reassigned from the cepartment in 1955)
and in the Tourist Department subsequently.

= Second, GOLITSYN made no comment about or identification
of NOSENKO prior to the public announcement of the latter's
defection, despite many previous opportunities to do so (e.ge,
in discussions of GUX, CHURAIOV, and KASHCHEYEV) and despite
GOLITSYY’s proven excellence of memory for names and tasks of
KGB personnel. GULITSYN gave little detail on the circun-
stances of his encounters with NOSENKO, and. he has not been
questioned further sbout them. Nevertheless, a4 indicated in

the foregoiny remarks on the circumstances in which the two

men could have met, it seems apparent that any contact would

have been brief, infrequent, casual, extre-offictal, ‘rt oe ts

GOLITSYN's having referred to their encounters but having mis-
identified NUSZNKU's positions in the KCE are: First, GOLITS#
could have erred; second, GOLITSYN cculd have lied for personal

reasonay and third, GOLITS’AI could heve lied at the direction

examine each of these points separutely: it

~ GOLITSYH could have erred. Apart free tne denial
by HUSERKO, who is an unreliable source, there 13 no evidence
to refute COLITSYU's statement that he and NCS2iKO met in

the tmerican vepartment in 1953 and in the Tourist S2pertment

in 1958 or 1959. (The conclusions? ‘art VilI.I. about
NOSFUKO's bona fides do not rule out the possibility that

he was physically present on occasion on the pramises of tha
two departments in these years, although not in the capacities

that he has claimed.) The nature of their encounters, however,

i

could have been such that GOLITSY erred in assuming - because
HosERKO was seen on or near the premises of the two departments,
and because NOSEXKO told GOLITSY4 in 1958 cr 1959 that he was
in the Tourist Department - that NOSENKO was therefore an

Second Chief

officer of these specific elements of the
Directorate. Thus, if GOLITSYI met NOSENKO as he said, he

mistakenly identified NOSENKO as being a menbder of the staffs

of the 4merican and Tourist Departments at these times.

although offering partial confirmation for NOS&:KO's clain3,
directly attucked the bona fides of another KGB-dispatched
agent of allegedly comparable rank and knowledgeability. acting
under KGS instructions, GOLITSYN would have sought to undermine
HOSENKO's acceptability, regardless of the fact that NOSZNKO
said he wes providing reliable and comprehensive information
about KGB operations against «american officials and tourists
in the Us5R. At the sume time, NOSENKC wis not giving an
account of their relationship that waa consistent with COLITSYN's,
by implication NOSHIKO was distorting or diluting the earlier
reports of GOLITSYN on KGB operations in the Soviet Union,
land NOSENKO was seeking to guin acceptance by ClA equal to that
experienced by GOLITSYN, According to this hyrothesis, two
sources under KGB control - each striving for acceptance -
deliberately guve conflicting stories of their zalationship,

and each tried to undermine the bona {ides of the other,

GOLITSYN explictly and NOSENKO by implication. This explanation
is so illoz‘cal, as well es so detrimental to tha KGB, that

it must be rejected from serious consideration.

report" regarding KG3 ignorance of the role of American
Intelligence in the PENKOVSKIY crse.

rport on the case, however, is contra-
-fictory tu his first report and to the othex sources: He
said in GRabmepylyss that surveillance of U.S. Embassy tar-
gets detected a visit to the Pushkin Sircct sit2 by an
American, and that the resulting 24-hour surveillance of the
site caught PENKOVSKIY visiting the same location, whereupon
he was arrestcd and confessed. CIA, however, has no evi-
dence besides the statements bam that PENKOVSKIY ever Pe)
went to the Pushkin Strect site after it was visited by CIA
personnel.

In GB 1963 GEER reported at greater length about
the role of Pushkin Street in PENKOVSKIY's compromise. At
this time he explained that the American had visited Pushkin
Street not once but twice: surveillance had observed him on
both uccasions when he went inside the entrance, but followed
“hh inside only on the second visit. The surveillant who i
entered the building reported that the Anerican appeared to
be tying his shoe; although this was not unusual in itself,

ontinucd, the ract that it was the second visit to
the same address for no visible purpose causcd suspicion,
and as a result the KGB installed a closed circuit 1V camera
to provide 24-hour coverage of the site. PRNKOVSKIY was ob-
served checking it (see preceding paragraph): an American
was observed loading a dead drop behind a lobby heating unit
(radiator); the KGB tagged the dead drop material with a
radioactive substance; PENKOVSKIY was observed unloading the
dead drop and proceeding to his office where he secreted the

3. Parallels with NOSENKO's Reporting
a. The GHEREPANOV Case
(i) Summary

One of the two ways in which @2EG@§" nas corroborated NOSENKO
on the authenticity of CGHEREPANOV as a cenuine source of American
Intelliger.ce was to cite information he hac learned from &

ees. 3 3
the KGB; CHEREPANOV cave some papers to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow,
which returned them to che Soviet ™: stry of Foreign Arfairs
(MPA); the MFA turned the papers over to the KGB, which traced
them by analysis to CHEREPANOV; meanwhile, CHZREPANOV had tried

to flee the USSR, but he was captured near the Turkish border and
executed. In every major respect, therefore agrees with
NOSENKO's version of the case. When asked whether the CHEREPANOV
incident might bave been “a trick" by the KGS to embarrass the
U.S. Embassy, replied that it was definitely not.

y served in

The second way in which Eger has certified that CHERSPANOV
was a geatine source is indirect, Like NOSEIKO and-enp-of the
GHEREPINOV documents, GUggaED MSC indicatec that KGB surv7:lience
of a U.S, Embassy officer crougnt about the compromise of POFOV.

(ii) Remarks

As stated in Part ViII.B.6., the CHEREPANOV incident was a”

is the best placed to report on the compromise of POPOV: @y€a-2 gray

CHEREFANOV, 25 well as that in the 16 Sept!
POFOV to CIA (kelieved to have been dictated by the KGB). These
four sources have indicated that the ccmpromise resulted from KGS
surveillance of a U. wbessy Official following the recall of
PCPOV in Nevemier 1958. however, has not precisely dated
the inciderc (dated by inference cry the cthers at 2) January 1959),
has asscciated it with an ntelligence dead drop for POPOV
(whereas the others have said Ats mailing of a letter to
POPOV), and has nor, the officer involved {GSeores WINTERS) 2}
The evidence from@Ggiase yi ike that from KOSENMO, GIEREPANCV, and
the PCFCY message, conflicts with that from COLITSYN whose state-

adnission to having had some correspondence with her concern-
ing his search for cperational leads: the superior told POPOV
that the Soviets believed "she was workisg for someone” and
that "possibly she is the cause“ of the Ferlin unit's opera-
tional difficulties. PCPOV was recalled to Moscow on 17 Nov-
ember 1958 ostersibly for a weex’s TDY to discuss the case

of an Arerican whom he was developing under CIA aegis. He

POPOV unlosding a dead drop. He was arrested, doubled, and
“operated” against American Intelligence for a year ard one-half.*
Eventually, the KG3 put in motion a plan to attempt to compromise

apprehended through a dead drop. PCPOV “apparently was under
suspicion there in Berlin, and when tncy (presumably the GRU)
recalled him to Moscow, they wondered who his future contacts

Since POPOV returned to Moscow in November 1958 and LANGELLE
was arrested the following October, he could not have been

** Starting on 4 January 1959, POPOV had a series of six brush
contacts in Moscow with the CIA officer Russell LANGELLE of
the U.S. Embassy, culminating in the detention and interview
of LANGELLE by the KGB on 16 October 1959.
