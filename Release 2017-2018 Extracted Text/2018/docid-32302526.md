SUBJECT:

GABRIEL MANNARINO, Aka.,

AR

SAMUEL MANNARINO, Aka.,

During the evening of 5/18/61, JAMES W. BURGART, Proprietor of W.W.

Burgart Confectionary Store,

956-5th Ave., New Kensington,

was interviewed for three hours in Monroeville, Pa., by SA THOMAS

G. FORSYTH, III, and among other things, BURGART advised:

His father, WILFRED W. BURGART, operated the confectionery from

approximately 1925 until his death in 1952 as a numbers-horse

his death

His father cooperated with the

MANNARINOs but was never part of their organization.

This was

tolerated by SAM MANNARINO because he had grown up with WILFRED

BURGART and was personally fond of him.

WILFRED BURGART was the

only "independent"

allowed to operate in a fashion where he banked

his own "play" and only contacted the MANNARINOs to "lay off."

When the

elder BURGART died in 1952, JAMES BURGARI took over his?

business, both legal and illegal,

and has operated until the

recent past much in the same fashion his father had done. About

two years ago, SAM MANNARINO went into semi-retirement and has

almost nothing to do with the rackets, leaving this field to his

brother, GABRIEL MANNARINO, known to BURGART as KELLY MANNARINO.

When KELLY became fully aware of the extent of BURGART'S

lucrative wagering business, he felt that BURGART should be

"pulled into line" with the

other small operators in the New

Kensington area and forced to become a low-level part of the

organization by turning in all wagers to MANNARINO c√¥llectors.

BURGART has consistently reiused,

with the result that KELLY

is increasingly annoyed and lately has been trying to steal

BURGART's long-time customers.

He has done this through threats

by spreading rumors that BURGART is not

financially able

of physical harm to pay wins, and by attempting to have New

Kensington police harass BURGART. This latter move has been

unsuccessful because of BURGART's close friendship with Mayor

RAYMOND GARDLOCK.

On the other hand, the other methods used

by KELLY MANNARINO have been more successful, and BURGART'S

business has suffered a loss of almost one-half.

Because of the above, BURGART is willing to assist the FBI in

any fashion, except that he is insistent that he will never, under

any circumstances,

testify at any sort of proceeding,

local or

Federal. A PCI file will be opened concerning BURGART.

on 5/19/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH as follows:

SAM MANNARINO has fixed up a room in the basement of the Bonfire

Restaurant, near Leechburg, fa., which looks as though it could

be used as a meeting place. Informant will submit a arawing oI

this room and its relationto other parts of the building.

GABRIEL MANNARINO has acquired a mated pair of Doberman Pinscher

dogs, along with

attack dogs "two puppies.

The dider dogs have been trained

The price

of the dogs is rumored to be in

excess of $2,000.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
