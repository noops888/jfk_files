When KELLY became fully aware of the extent of BURGART's
lucrative wagering business, he felt that BURGART should be
"pulled into line" with the other small operators in the New
Kensington area and forced to become a low-level part of the
organization by turning in all wagers to MANNARINO ¢déLLectors.
BURGART has consistently refused, with the result that. KELLY
is increasingly annoyed and lately has been trying to steal
BURGART's long-time customers. He has done this through threats
of physical harm, by spreading rumors that BURGART is not
financially able to pay wins, and by attempting to have New
Kensington police harass BURGART, This latter move has been
unsuccessful because of BURGART's close friendship with Mayor
RAYMOND GARDLOCK. On the other hand, the other methods used
by KELLY MANNARINO have been more successful, and BURGART's
pusiness has suffered a loss of almost one-half.

Because of the above, BURGART is willing to assist the FBI in

any fashion, except that he is insistent that he will never, under
any circumstances, testify at any sort of proceeding, local or
Federal. A PCI file will be opened concerning BURGART.

on 5/19/61, PG 615-C advised SA FORSYTH as follows:

SAM MANNARINO has fixed up a room in the basement of the Bonfire
Restaurant, near Leechburg, Pa., which looks as though it could
be used as a meeting place. Informant will submit a drawing of
this room and its relation to other parts of the building.

GABRIEL MANNARINO has acquired a mated pair of Doberman Pinscher
dogs, along with two puppies. The @der dogs have been trained
as “attack dogs." The price of the dogs 1s rumored to be in
excess of $2,000. +

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
