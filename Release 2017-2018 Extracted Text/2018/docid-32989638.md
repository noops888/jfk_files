ELLSBERG CASE H 4-A-3

SECTION CHIEF W. R. WANNALL v@)
NATIONALITIES INTELLIGENCE SECTION ee

1. Initial investigation by Bureau opened 1/20/70 based on informa-

. tion from step-mother of subject's former wife to the effect that subject, with

his children, took papers from his olfice al Rand Corporation in Santa Monica,

California, and copied them with intent that they be made available for Senator, s
Fulbright and Goodell, This information had come to knowledge of Carol,
Elisberg through the“Elisherg children, Initial investigation continued thr through
9/25/70 when basic facts were presented to Department of Justice with note that
no further action would be taken in the absence of a specific request a the
Department. No such request was received,

On 6/13/71 "The New York Times" commenced publishing a series

_ of articles purporting to report on the history of the U. S. decision-making process

concerning Vietnam policies for the period 1945-1967. "The New York Times"
on a study. later identified 9s 9 47-volume history

nited States ietnam Relations During the Period 1945-1967,"
commonly known as the "McNamara Study."' The "McNamara Study" was
prepared beginning in 1967 and was classified "Top Secret."

On 6/15/71 the Attorney General requested FBI to conduct all 1 necessary
investigation into the matter relating to the publication of classified information
by "The New York Times.'' Our 1970 investigation and initial reports from
sources obtained in instant matter pinpointed Ellsberg as the prime suspect
responsible for the leak of classified data to news media. Extensive investigation

-at Los Angeles pinned down the identities of individuals present in October,

1969, when Ellsberg duplicated classified documents available to him through his
employment at Rand Corporation in Santa Monica. Also revealed were his own
statements to his former wife that he, in fact, was converting the classified
documents to his own use to furnish them to various Congressional figures. The
Los Angeles investigation has resulted in Ellsberg's current indictment alleging

- violation of Section 793(e), Title 18, U, S. Code (unauthorized possession of

documents involved and unlawful retention of same) and Section 641, Title 18

- (conversion of the documents to his own use), The Los Angeles investigation was

the sole basis for this indictment and served as the basis for current imprisonment

“on charge of contempt of court of Anthony J, Russo who was present on one

occasion when Ellsberg allegedly duplicated material in his possession.

Investigation at Washington, D, C., has pinned down Ellsberg's access
to the documents in question and has additionally revealed his early change from
"hawk" to "dove." It has also revealed his contacts with individuals at high
levels in Federal Government attempting to persuade them to put before American
public details of decisions underlying the U. S. policy in Vietnam.

Investigation at Boston has uncovered activity by Neil and Susan
Sheehan, employees of 'The New York Times," in late March, 1971. This
activity has included extensive details of sessions where duplication of portions
of the ''McNamara Study" were involved. Revealed have been details identifying
the printing companies utilized by the Sheehans, considerable travel between
these companies and apartments available to or utilized by Ellsberg. We have
- uncovered extensive detail of Ellsberg's contacts from his Cambridge,
. Massachusetts, residence with members of the news media. Also revealed has
- been contact by Ellsberg with factions of the New Left and anti-Vietnam peace groups.

We have recently expanded our investigation in attempt to uncover details

of dissemination of the 'McNamara Study" by Ellsberg to other newspapers: in
which articles appeared attributed to the "McNamara Study." This investigation
has revealed at least three newsmen from the Washington, D. C., bureaus of
‘the newspapers involved were in the Boston and/or Cambridge area during the week
immediately prior to Ellsberg's surrender on 6/28/71. We have learned that at
least one newspaper had been contacted by an unknown individual in Boston who had
offered the "McNamara Study" instructing that if the newspaper involved wished to
avail itself of the offer, the classified documents could be picked up in Boston

‘ after contacting. a given telephone number in that area for more detailed instructions.
We are pursuing this facet of the investigation vigorously to pin down exact activities
of the newspaper personnel involved and when this is done, we contemplate

* interviewing them for additional details.

Extensive investigation has been afforded the possibility that Ellsberg
benefited from considerable assistance from other individuals in his attempt to
disseminate the "McNamara Study" to the news media. Along these lines we have |
detected early reports of Ellsberg's cooperation with elements of the War Resistors
League and have identified individuals in that organization described by Ellsberg
as the principal influences on his change to a militant opposition to the U.S. -
Vietnam policies. Investigation is continuing along these lines to establish if any

- individuals in these dissident groups may have assisted Ellsberg in his alleged
violations of the statutes noted.

A relative of Mr, Haldeman at the White House, France Raine, reported
that while attending a football game in Los Angeles in October, 1970, he overheard
a conversation between two men sitting near him whom he believed to be prominent

3



; —

in the Business Executives Movement for Vietnam (BEM). This conversation
involved the plan on the part of an unidentified individual to leak secret informa-
tion to the press in the Spring of 1971, with the unidentified individual being
mentioned as being an employee of Rand Corporation and having formerly served
as an advisor to Dr, Kissinger at the White House, Also mentioned by the
-conversants was the plan on the part of two White House aides to resign their
' positions sometime during the Summer of 1971 and to make anti-Administration
revelations at that time regarding U. S. - Vietnam policy. Ellsberg was known to
have appeared on at least two occasions as a speaker for BEM functions in
Los Angeles and Washington, D, C. A close associate of his in Los Angeles was
a former leader of the BEM chapter in that city. We have intensified our investiga-
tion of BEM and conducted extensive investigation to pin down identities of persons
seated near Raine during the game in question. We are continuing our investigation
along these lines to pinpoint a possible conspiracy existing as early as October,
1970, with ramifications of anti-Administration activity and revelation of classified
information. : : 7

: We have recently received from Attorney General clarification of the
areas in which we can conduct investigation in this matter and, as a result, are
’ extending our interviews into news media circles where we feel we can uncover
individuals who will cooperate with us in revealing details of the Ellsberg
revelations and any conspiracy that may have existed involving him and others to
- expose to public scrutiny the classified information involved in this case.

2. At the outset of this investigation Assistant Director Brennan spoke
at a Division Chiefs' Conference and also directly to the Section Chief, Nationalities
Intelligence Section, regarding the possibility of a wide-scale conspiracy in which

. Elisberg could be involved. His observations along these lines were recorded in
‘a memorandum to all Division Chiefs dated 7/23/71 and captioned "Re: Organizations]
Survey (Priorities and Manpower)."' In this memorandum he commented upon the
fact that the Ellsberg case might be a landmark in historical significance in view
’ of the long-range potential regarding Governmental operations and the FBI's role
‘in rd ation thereto. He stated that the leak in this case represented a deliberate
and determined effort on the part of certain individuals to seriously disrupt and
” destroy the Government's capacity to carry out effectively its foreign policy in
various areas. : if

Mr. Brennan noted that the past 15 to 20 years had witnessed the evolutior
of a new breed of fanatics who were determined to disrupt and destroy Governmentai
operations and to alter this country's foreign policy. He further noted that the
movement supported by these fanatics bordered on treason which must be dealt
with if our current form of Government is to survive.

or Ae)
During the early stages of the investigation in this case it became
. - Quite evident that Ellsberg had received assistance in getting into the hands
+ of various newspapers the "McNamara Study.'' He admitted as much on
. 6/28/71 in responding to questions raised by reporters when he surrendered
’ himself at the Boston Courthouse following issuance of a complaint charging
him with violating the Espionage Statute. Accordingly, the thrust of our
‘investigation has been directed toward identifying any individual or individuals
or organization that may have assisted or conspired with Ellsberg. It was :
noted that developments had indicated that at least part of the "McNamara Study"
was reportedly in the possession of the Institute for Policy Studies and that
while a page-by-page review of the Bureau's file on that Institute had not
revealed any information concerning Ellsberg, we had developed material in the
, ‘Ellsberg investigation sands connections between him and some of _ Institute
: employees. aoe | - eet : :

He We have not developed any hard evidence ‘confirming that a wide- -spread

however, of one thread common to certain of these leaks. That is, individuals
“such as Ellsberg, who were either bitterly opposed to the U. S, - Vietnam policy
.°or in disagreement with other major foreign policy issues, have set themselves
_ up above the law, claiming the right to decide what should be released to the
public regardless of Executive Branch classification assigned to information.

“ session, have identified individuals who assisted Blsberg in this task, but

: interviews of these persons have developed nothing to indicate they were aware
. Of the nature of the items being reproduced or of what use Ellsberg intended
- . to make of the copies reproduced. Anthony Russo, a fellow employee of
Ellsberg's at Rand in Santa Monica, would have been in an excellent position to
have been aware of the ultimate purpose of Elisberg's actions but has refused to
_ talk to the Federal grand jury in Los Angeles, and is Scunenty in es for
7 » contempt of court relating to this refusal. 7
: ‘ Subsequent to the duplicating of documents in October; 1969, “Bileberg,
~by his own statements, claims to have made efforts to furnish copies of these
“documents to Senator J, William Fulbright and former Senator Charles E. Goodell,
and Senator George §, McGovern may also have been approached by Ellsberg
- concerning making these documents public. Representative Paul N, McCloskey,
. Jfz, is also known to be in possession of documents which he publicly admits
were given to him by Ellsberg. Data available concerning this phase of Ellsberg's
actions also fails to indicate he Gachatad in concert with anyone. :

on 6/13/71 “The New York Times" published the first of a series
‘a of articles purporting to have been based on the "McNamara study," and a
number of other newspapers in the U. S. subsequently printed similar articles.
- Investigation has placed Neil Sheehan, a reporter for "The New York Times," in
: Cambridge, Massachusetts; daring March and April, 1971, under an assumed
_- name, and we have determined Sheehan and his wife engaged in a number of
. frantic copying sessions of documents during the period 3/21-23/71, Four
* blurred Xerox copies discarded during this duplicating have been identified by ©
: ”, thé National Security Agency as being reproductions of pages appearing in the
. “McNamara ‘Study. wit is highly probable Sheehan and Elisberg cooperated closely
in actions which enabled 'The New York Times" to obtain the documents utilized
cn articles published by this newspaper and we have recently uncovered evidence
- indicating representatives of at least three other newspapers which have published
articles based on the "McNamara Study" were in the Boston area in June, 1971,
* for the apparent purpose of obtaining copies of these documents. A source closely
“connected with one of these newspapers has advised that his newspaper obtained

the documents after receiving a telephone call from an mknown individual who
instructed that a reporter from the newspaper go to Cambridge and make the
necessary arrangements to obtain them by calling a certain, unidentified telephone
number. Investigation subsequently placed this reporter in Cambridge, but we

have, to date, been unsuccessful in determining who furnished him with the

: material in question. While the newspapermen thus involved may have cooperated

-. with Ellsberg in various ways in order to obtain the desired documents, .
available evidence does not suggest they conspired with him in carrying out the
disclosure of these documents, but rather took advantage of his offer to furnish
them with the material, ;

: We are, oues, vigorously pursuing all leads relating to the
possession by “The New York Times" and other newspapers of the "McNamara

- There remains the suggestion Ellsberg may: have “received the coopera~

, exists that the IPS has been in possession for some time of documents which may

be identical with the "McNamara Study.'' We have also learned, in tracing the

development of Ellsberg's thinking from "hawk" to "dove," that from August,
-' 1969, he became increasingly associated with a number of the more prominent
.. ¥ anti-war exponents in this country, many of whom occupy important posts at

- Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We are in the

‘process of tying together all of this data, in an effort to surface, if possible,
- any possible connection between these elements and Ellsberg in the disclosure

ae “of the highly classified "McNamara Study," but information available to date
-, does not, as yet, Substantiate or corroborate existence of a conspiracy i in this
regard, 7 : s 7

a a Wi eens are to the’ President's concern ‘expressed by
. Haldeman to the Director, mentioned hereinbefore, with respect to the
complicity ot individuals, and the instructions of the Attorney General that the
Bureau in each leak case identify the individuals responsible, it is quite clear
that we must resolve all allegations, especially those pertaining to possible

‘ conspiracies, during the course of our inquiries. As noted in Item 1, our ©
inquiries have expanded to include not only the leak to "The New York Times"
but to encompass the eight other newspapers which carried portions of the

* "McNamara Study.''. Since its inception, the Ellsberg case has.required expanding
supervisory attention here at the SOG.. Nine men are currently committed to the
- ease, There are no indications at this time that less supervisory attention will be

needed in the near future. In fact, all indications are that there may have to be

more commitments in this regard, particularly if the Department refers additional

certainly have a very important impact on Governmental processes, particularly

- ‘within the Executive Branch of our Government, When the Supreme Court
refused to grant injunctions sought by the Executive Branch against newspapers
publishing the "McNamara Study," this upheld the freedom of the press. The-

"+ ,question has not yet been litigated with respect to the right of the Executive
Branch to protect its secrets through its classification system. ease

: _ ‘Unless Ellsberg is prosecuted successfully, anyone within the
Executive Branch would apparently have the right to decide on his own initiative
- what information he wishes to place in the public domain by turning the informa-
tion over to the newspapers. Much of the sensitive negotiations of the Executive
. Branch with foreign countries is dependent upon the secrecy with which they
are carried out, If through a classification system or some other means the
Executive Branch is not able to preclude the unauthorized disclosure of its
“secrets it is felt the Branch will be weakened to the extent that it cannot effectively
... function on the Alational scene certainly, and probably on the domestic scene in
some instances, Thus, the structure of the Executive Branch might well collapse.
: “An unsuccessful prosecution would buttress the considerable support,
*- particularly from the news media, for Ellsberg's contention that his disclosure
.of the classified documents was basically motivated by conscience and by deep
- concern that the public should be informed. It is closely related to the viewpoint
~ held by a small but growing minority that an individual is free to follow the dictates
‘of his conscience and io be the final arbiter of the validity of our criminal and
.” civil statutes. If this thesis were to be supported, then it could apply to murder
., and bombings of Government and private institutions where such acts are dictated
“ by conscience. It could follow that the Legislative, Executive and Judicial
‘functions of the Nation are exercises in futility. This would be a road to anarchy.

: 7 From the above, it would appear that the outcome of the Ellsberg il
_ case would have a direct bearing on the Executive Branch. of our Government and
” eould affect the entire Governmental structure. reser : :

: directed at developing evidence concerning violations of Federal statutes under

. which, we have investigative jurisdiction and our principal efforts have been

’ directed toward this responsibility. There are also far reaching aspects of the

_ case which require investigative attention and because they are so diversified
there is a necessity for directing efforts in the first instance along those channels

which are of greatest importance. These channels relate : especially to the

'. possibility of a conspiracy, if in fact one exists, on the part of individuals to

those prosecutive aspects which to date have been considered by the Department
and efforts are currently underway to resolve the atiacioet conspiracy aspects. :

‘of this case have related to efforts on the part of Assistant Attorney General
: -Mardian. and attorneys within his Division to (1) conduct investigative activity
eir own and (2) to direct our investigative activities frequently into areas
- " tangential to the main thrust of the case. With respect to investigative efforts
"by Mardian. the following are cited as examples:

NW°55251 Docld:32989638 Page 24... 12°



“On 6/: 29/7 1 Mardi: an telephonically advised he was ‘sending a ‘Depart-
mental attorney to see Senator Charles McC, Mathias, Jr., who had received
from Ellsberg some copies of Classified documents. He said the Departmental

. attorney would discuss with Mathias the possibility of Mathias' turning these

* documents over to him, Mardian asked if we wanted to have an Agent accompany

ithe attorney, The Director’conctrred that no Agent accompany the attorney,
rasan "Let Mardian's emissary iasaiits them." "

: On 7/21/71 when Agents of Washington Field Office endeavored to.
interview Mr. Charles W. Cooke, Special Assistant to the Secretary of Health,
' Education and Welfare, they were advised by Cooke that he would not submit to
‘interview in the absence of clearance granted by the Deputy Attorney General.
» .This was in pursuance of a lead which had been referred to us by jan.and
when the Cooke interview was attempted it was learned for the first time that two
. attorneys from the Internal Security ae had been designated | to conduct
* the interview with Cooke. Pc ny

“On 8/10/71 one of Mardian's atoreye Pree to ‘say ‘that ‘he was

: if the Bureau would arrange a place where he could meet securely with the
informant and whether the Bureau desired to have an Agent present during the
interview. In concurring that Bureau should not accede td these requests, the
Director noted, ."If Heaaie outfit would refrain from what are basicaliy

cacsein brani activith s and leave it Lt the Bureau there would be a fr iction."

ms On 3/ 12/ 1 the Bureau recéived through misrouting a communication
which wissen had addressed to the Attorney General to summarize current
-information in what he described as "Our continuing investigation into the
acquisition of the "McNamara Study' by the ‘New York Times." The Director

_ inquired whether Marcas outfit was conducting their own investigation in this

. by the Bureau. :

ql For example, both letters contained requests to seuauee investiga-
: tion previously conducted and reported to the Department. Certain other
requests contained therein would more logically fall within the province of the
.- Special Task Force Committee established by the Department of Defense to
analyze Rand Corporation security procedures. Other requested investigation
. had previously been initiated by the Bureau and other investigative requests were
“not on their face germane to the violations or potential violations of law. Certain
- _- of the requested investigation appeared to be based on unsupported assumptions
. and theories of the invdvement of other individuals in the leak of the ''Pentagon
a Papers" — offered no basis or reasons for the requested investigation.

The most recent letter, 8/23/71, contained request for investigation

f Elisberg' s travel. We have been developing this information since the

. ‘inception of our investigation and it has been furnished to the Department on an

*-; almost daily basis. This letter also requested inquiries concerning certain

.telephone calls by Ellsberg, investigation concerning most of which had also

“been previously initiated. Mardian also stated Department files had no informa-

tion on Leonard S. Rodberg,* whose name has recently come up in this case ds the

possible source of the "McNamara Study" material which will be published by

"-the Beacon Press in Boston. . We have in this and other cases furnished information
on Racbens in approximately a dozen See i

The analyses ofthese lengthy letters from Martian zenires the
. ee of a.considerable amount of Agent time. They indicate that Mardian'‘
group, apparently in efforts to direct our investigation, are propounding questions,
“* |. some of which are relevant but many of which are not relevant to the main thrust
“. of our investigation, some of which should be referred elsewhere, and ee of
which have been previously answered. :

In accordance with instructions issued by the “Assistant Director, we
are furnishing to Mardian copies of the daily teletypes from our field offices.
. .These teletypes contain "raw" investigative results not coordinated. The
. coordination of these results-regularly appears in our investigative reports
which are also furnished to Mardian. We feel that the reports resolve many of
«+ the questions which have been propounded by Mardian in the past and it would
“enhance our investigative efforts to eliminate dissemination of the daily teletypes
in the future and give to the Department investigative results in report form,
- supplemented by a weekly summary letter which we regularly forward to him.

ELLSBERG CASE

: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNA

I génerally concur with the comments of Mr. Wannall
as to the progress and status of this case from an investigative
standpoint. I have reminded Mr. Wannall that the development of
direct evidence should not be obscured by the broadening of the
scope of this case. He has been advised that his objective must
consistently be the development of substantial admissible evidence
necessary to establish a conviction as to Federal violations
charged in the Los Angeles indictment of Elisberg and others which
may develop from other corollary investigations being conducted.

From the outset, as stated by Mr. Wannall, I expressed
the importance of this case and instructed him to advise me of
any manpower needs. The question of manpower is discussed under
the caption "Adequacy of Personnel" found in 6E of this report and
was the subject of my memorandum to Mr. Sullivan 7/29/71 captioned
"Proposed Adjustments of Work Assignments, DID," memorandum of
W. R. Wannall to Mr. Felt 8/12/71 captioned "Adequacy of Personnel,
Did," aad my memorandum to Mr. Sullivan 8/12/71 captioned "Adequacy
of Personnel, Leak Cases, DID."

In reference to Mr. Wannall's concluding suggestion in
his writeup, the procedure of furnishing daily teletypes to the
Department in major cases is not unusual. The high level interest
of the Department, which will eventually be responsible for the
prosecution of this case, as well as the interest of the White
House dictates that teletypes in this matter be disseminated
consistent with the Director's instructions, copy attached. It
appears we should clarify the Department's use of these "raw"
investigative results as set forth in our teletypes and suggest
their detailed reviews be conducted from Bureau investigative
reports, which are the normal communication for such use. Mr. Wannall
will be instructed to advise the Department by letter with regard
to the foregoing pointing out that our weekly summary letters and
investigative reports will resolve many of the questions they raise
as to information in our teletypes.

VA mir E, 8, MILLER: This case involves the publishing of parts
Lieb Wh a White :bhg, 9/7/71) . of the "McNamara Study" in June, 1971,

by "The New York Times," The ‘evidence
"to date strongly indicates Daniel Ellsberg is responsible for furnishing the
classified data to representatives of this newspaper, and he has been indicted
by a Federal Grand Jury for the unauthorized possession and conversion of
these documents. This is the case simply stated; however, this matter is
far irom being so simple. From its inception, this case has been complicated
by the enormity of the work to be completed and problems inherent in this
unusual investigation.

In regard to the amount of work involved, a survey was made
to establish how many communications were dated during the period of a
single week (Saturdays and Sundays included). As a result of this survey,
the following represents the number of communications dated during the
weeks noted below:

: The above-noted chart is believed to be representative of the
high volume of communications received daily. Many of these communications
were lengthy and/or complicated requiring close analysis by one or more
super visors assigned to this "Special." Also, a check of the work devoted to
the preparation of daily summary memos and of weekly summaries disclosed °
a supervisor would arrive at the office at approximately 5:30 a.m. each morning,
Monday through Friday, to have the daily memos dictated and typed by 8:15 a.m.
the same day, and the Supervisor responsible for the weekly summary due each
Monday would spend approximately 6 hours preparing this communication on
the prior Sunday. Noteworthy, too, is the fact that many responses to the
jetters from the Attorney General's Office require extensive research.

With the approval by the Attorney General to interview newspaper-
men, it is anticipated that the work load will increase rather than decrease in
the immediate future. Initially there will be at least 75 newspapermen to be
interviewed and numerous additional leads will be developed from these inter-
views. This investigation involves numerous facets and requires extensive
work and supervision.

Presently there are 9 Supervisors assigned to this case and their
responsibilities are as follows:

E.R. Harrell, Unit Chief, reviews all outgoing correspondence,
reviews incoming reports in £llsberg case; supervises preparation of daily
Summary memorandum, weekly White House memorandum in Elisberg case,
SALT Lek case (leak of classified information concerning Strategic Arms
Limitations Talks appearing in "The New York Times"), and the Toll Lek
case (leak from State Department cables concerning alleged misconduct of
Bert M. Tollefson, Jr.); assists in setting out leads from daily teletype
correspondence from field.

J. R. Wagoner, as case Agent in McLek, responsible for review
of all incoming reports as to adequacy of reporting and leads; maintains and
supervises operation of lead box in Ellsberg case; responsible for follow-up
communications on outstanding leads; has basic responsibility for preparation
of weekly White House summary; assists in preparation of daily memorandum
summarizing prior day's investigative activity in the field.

J. R. Hagy, as case Agent, has all supervisory responsibility
for Toll Lek; conducts research on all New Left aspects of Ellsberg investi-
gation and responsible for preparation of comprehensive analysis of New
Left implication in the case; responsible for setting out leads relative to New
Left associates and contacts by Ellsberg; responsible for following field
investigation; corroborating attendance by Ellsberg at New Left functions;
assists in leads obtained from daily teletypes in McLek and Toll Lek cases;

-_ fF

assists in preparation of daily summary memorandum; and assists in prepara-
tion of weekly White House summary.

HJ. Morgan, as case Agent, has primary responsibility for
supervision of SALT Lek case; reviews all incoming correspondence and
sets out pertinent leads relative to SALT Lek; assists in preparation of daily
“memorandum summarizing investigation in all three major leak cases afore-
mentioned; assists in review of daily teletype traffic in all three major leak
cases; review of dissemination of weekly reports in SALT Lek; assists in
preparation of White House summary.

L.E. Belanger handles all ELSUR checks; reviews, correlates
and conducts necessary research relative to all material received from
Department of Defense in Ellsberg investigation; responsible for backup file
reviews in connection with New Left contacts by Ellsberg; assists in preparation
of weekly White House memorandum; assists in preparation of daily summary
memorandum.

T. J. Seabaugh assigned exclusively to a comprehensive study,
charting and réséarch into extensive trayel performed by Daniel Elisbere;
responsible for setting out leads to insure complete coverage of all details
of travel facets of investigation.

J. P. Benedict responsible for extensive file reviews regarding
numerous news media personnel and personalities involved in Ellsberg
investigation to ascertain their susceptibility to interview as cooperative
sources; conducting extensive research and charting of the considerable
telephone traffic involved in this matter, including traffic from Daniel
Elisberg, Anthony Russo, the Sheehans, 'The New York Times, " the

- Washington bureaus of all hewspapers ‘ivolved, traffic from various hotels
utilized by Ellsberg and his contacts, and all other individuals whose
telephone traffic has been subpoenaed as a result of Departmental action via
Grand Jury subpoena.

W, W. Hamilton assists in preparation of daily summary memo-
randum; responsible for review and appropriate preparation of all summary
teletypes for dissemination to Department of Justice; file reviews on the
numerous news personalities being considered for interviews as potential
cooperative sources in the Elisberg investigation; handling of correspondence
connected with leads obtainedfrom daily teletypes; assists in preparation of
White House summary.

J. M. Sizoo assigned exclusively to the research and preparation
of an extensive biographical write-up on Elisberg. In this regard, facts con- .
cerning Ellsberg's life, behavioral patterns, associates, education, political
views, personality transformations, family, and influences will be studied
and analyzed. i

In addition to the above specific assignments, each member of
the unit on a daily basis is required to participate in Section, Unit and/or
Branch conferences for resolution of investigative facets of the Ellsberg,
Toll Lek and SALT Lek investigations,

Some of the problems involved in this investigation are:

(1) Whether Ellsberg was alone responsible for this crime, or
whether he was part of a small or large-scale conspiracy.

(2} Whether the purpose was for idealistic reasons (anti-Vietnam
War beliefs), to discredit the Executive Branch of the Government, or to
make available classified information to a foreign nation.

(3} Investigations have been conducted by agencies other than
the FBI: State Department, Department of Defense, NSA and the Attorney
General's Office, and it is the Bureau's responsibility to review and analyze these
investigations.” 7

(4) To determine what other persons and newspapers received
these documents and from whom they received this data.

: (5) Innumerable interviews involve newspapermen, Government
officials, and persons having far left leanings, against U. S. policy in Vietnam
and antagonistic toward the present Administration. These are all delicate
interviews.

(6) To determine whether the New Left ae any anti- Vietnam
peace groups are involved in this case,

(7) All logical avenues of investigation to bring this case to a
successful prosecution must be explored. An unsuccessful prosecution would
open the door for anyone at whim to disclose classified information which
could easily endanger the stability of the Executive Branch and impair our
relations with other nations.

o :

(8) The White House and the Attorney General's Office are closely
following this matter and all other leak cases, and in this respect the Attorney
General's Office has sent numerous communications requesting certain leads
be covered by the FBI. These requests must be analyzed by DID and the
appropriate communications answered, which is a time- ~consuming administrative
procedure.

In regard to the last situation noted above, you are aware that
the Department is reviewing for lead purposes the daily teletypes we furnish
them. Thereafter, they send us a communication requesting us to conduct
these leads. This must be stopped. Such a procedure is unproductive and
time consuming, resulting in additional unnecessary communications to the
Department. You are instructed to immediately advise the Department that
the purpose of the daily teletypes is to make them cognizant of the devebpments
in this case and that the FBI fully intends to pursue all other logical investi-
gation based on these communications.

With the importance of this case, the urgency of the problems
to be resolved, the imunediacy of the work to be performed, and the volume ~
of communications received daily, there appears sufficient work at the
present for nine Supervisors. However, you must constantly evaluate the
work load to assure that the assigned manpower is fully justified. Also, much
of the present work is exploratory, which involves researching and analyzing
and thereafter assuring that the many facets are immediately and fully
probed. Once these exploratory aspects are sufficiently investigated, this

case will be directed toward more specific objectives which will narrow the
investigative field. As this transition period is entered, immediate con-
sideration should be given to reducing the manpower assigned to this matter,
‘Also, it is incumbent upon you to make certain that all logical investigation
is expeditiously and fully conducted in order that the Bureau will not be
subjected to criticism by any person or agency.

A review of this matter indicates that you should continue affording
it top priority supervision and direction.

EAST COAST CONSPIRACY : 4-A-4

NSPECTOR E. S. MILLER: At the time of the last inspection this
matter was being afforded urgent
supervision and investigation for the purpose of identifying all of the
conspirators and perfecting cases for prosecution against them.

You are requested to provide a brief narrative summary of this investigation
and bring it up to date. Indicate in your response the number of subjects
on whom we have developed prosecutive cases, the number yet to be developed
and in each instance indicate what you feel are the possibilities of successful
prosecution.

_ In this regard, identify any cases in which successful prosecution is in
doubt and indicate what action is being taken to erase tha doubt.

What is the current status of prosecution of these cases and when do you
feel these cases will be adjudicated?

From a supervisory standpoint, advise how much manpower is being
expended presently on the supervision of this (these) cases and indicate when
you feel thesé men can be reassigned to other work,

Comments of Assistant Director requested.

SECTION CHIEF R. L. suacknuvoangf) The investigation of the
East Coast Conspiracy to
Save Lives (EASTCON) is concerned with plots in Washington, D. C.,
to blow up the tunnels housing the heating system servicing
Government buildings and to kidnap a high Government official.
Individuals connected with these plots are all associated with
the Berrigan antiwar movement, An indictment was returned during

8/24/71

the last inspection (1/12/71) at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which
charged six individuals with complicity in these plots and two

of these six were charged additionally with a violation of the
contraband statute in that they caused unauthorized letters to

be exchanged into and out of the Federal Penitentiary a Lewisburg,
Pennsylvania, There were also seven individuals named in the
indictment as unindicted co-conspirators.

Our investigation into this matter continued, and on
4/30/71, a superseding indictment was returned which expanded the
charges and strengthened our case. Eight individuals were included
in this indictment as defendants, and the number of unindicted
co-conspirators was reduced to four, The superseding indictment
includes those charges listed above and added the conspiracy
aspects of the selected Selective Service break-in cases in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Rochester, New York; Wilmington,
Dover, and Georgetown, Delaware, Two additional counts added to
the superseding indictment involve three individuals and charged
them with the mailing of a threatening communication,

In addition to the substantive case, potential witnesses
have been either cited for civil contempt of court or indicted for
criminal contempt of court in connection with their refusal to
answer questions before the Federal Grand Jury (FGJ) in Harrisburg
after being granted immunity, Five individuals were cited for civil
contempt, and four individuals were indicted for criminal contempt.
Two of these cases are currently the subject of a petition by the
Government to the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of
certiorari, and the other cases are being held in abeyance until
the Supreme Court renders its decision,

From the investigation conducted to date and the comments
of the prosecutive staff of the Department, there does not appear
to be any reason to believe.-.....that. prosecution of this case
will not be successful, : 7

The substantive EASTCON case is currently in the pretrial
stage. with numerous motions of both the Government and the defense
still pending before the court, At present, it appears that the
court will be unable to set this matter for trial until January,
1972. Even though we are well on our way to trial, due to the
complexities of charges in the indictment and the broad scope of
the violations involved, there exists additional facets of investi-~
gation of a continuing hature which will possibly increase as the
trial date approaches,

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 36 7



For example, in the Fall of 1970 we] undertook to
determine through an Automatic Data Processing (ADP) project
. whether EASTCON principals had established a long distance
telephone communication network, The basis for this theory was
information received from our informant, PH 1211-S, who advised
that fictitious telephone credit card numbers were being utilized
by members of the Berrigan antiwar movement to facilitate contacts.
This project disclosed voluminous calls between EASTCON principals
and between them and sympathizers from their own telephones and
also corroborate the fraudulent use of fictitious telephone credit
card numbers, This information was of value tothe Department in
the examination of witnesses before the FGJ since it placed
witnesses in a position of either admitting contact between each
other on specific dates, committing perjury, or claiming the
Fifth Amendment, This project has more recently been extended
and is now being utilized to identify individuals involved. in the
Washington, D. C., plots of the EASTCON case through "nonhit"
telephone toll calls between EASTCON activists and persons not
previously known to have been active in the movement, It is
believed that recent information from this project, developed
further by investiga n, has identified.a Capitol Hill elevator
operator who was rec: ted for these plots, The project is a
continuing one, and the investigation of pertinent developments
hopefully will identify an engineer who was consulted on the
tunnel plot, as well as other individuals involved in the
Washington, D. C., action, The very technical nature of the
raw material developed by the ADP project has resulted in
individuals at the Bureau and certain offices such as Philadelphia,
New York, Baltimore, and WFO having become well versed and
particularly adroit in the interpretation of such complicated
information,

The investigation of EASTCON includes the handling of
two informants; the first, PH 1211-S, is the individual who will
be responsible for the introduction of the most convincing
evidence against all of the defendants - the letters between
Philip Berrigan and Elizabeth McAlister which relate to every
count in the indictment, Since the testimony of this informant
before the FGJ, he has become theoretically the responsibility of
the Department, -as a Government witness, but of necessity, the
Bureau has coordinated his activities, etc., because of his
peculiar status until he testifies at trial. He is currently

living many miles from Harrisburg under an assumed‘identity and is

gainfully employed through the assistance of the Bureau. All of

these problems have been coordinated through the Bureau to insure

the security of this valuable source, As an example, the informant's

father recently died and unfriendly members of the news media

became aware of funeral arrangements, By instructions of the

Bureau and through very competent handling by the field, the

security of this informant was maintained in spite of the presence

of unfriendly members of the press at the funeral, It will be

necessary to continue to coordinate any other problems of this

nature until his testimony is heard during trial. In this regard,

as the trial date approaches, other problems develop requiring

Bureau assistance such as arrangements for "in depth" conferences

with the Department's prosecutive team under secure circumstances,

This will be a very important conference since the informant has

only been interviewed (briefly) by the Department on one occasion,

and no opportunity has existed since his appearance before the FGJ

to further explore his testimony,

We have also developed another informant, PH 1223-S, who
is a close friend of Philip Berrigan and active sympathizers in
the Berrigan antiwar movement, He is the only individuai who has
obtained any identification of possible MEDBURG suspects from
John, Peter Grady (arrested in the Camden Federal Building break-in
8/22/71) . Grady indirectly claimed credit for that action and by
inference named other people who are considered prime suspects,
The informant has recently accepted a position of running a
newspaper at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on behalf of The Defense
Committee, the legal, bail bond, and public relations arm of the
Berrigan, antiwar movement. He is a unique and cunning individual
who is now in a vital position to keep us informed of the on-the-
_scene and behind-the-scene activities in Harrisburg during the
EASTCON trial. Oneextremely important example of the valuable
information this informant has furnished resulted in our initiating
(as a corollary investigation to EASTCON) an Espionage - X-type
case based upon information he received from an ardent Berrigan,
supporter who has stated the intention to obtain classified
documents from the Lyndon B, Johnson Library in Austin, Texas,
to be publicized for the benefit of the antiwar movement in the
same manner as those circulated by Daniel Ellsberg..

With respect to The Defense Committee, investigation is
being coordinated as to the activities of this loose-knit group
due to its direct relationship to the EASTCON case. There has
evolved a national organization, and the activities of local
groups, as they become organized, will be followed by the Bureau
for intelligence information, As an indication of the potential
of this body, recognizing that its real push for funds

.Further, many pretrial motions (by defense counsel) have been

will reportedly not begin until the Fall of 1971, information
has been received that they already have substantial funds in
their coffers,

From information developed by PH 1223-S, it was determined
that John Peter Grady was planning an "action which from an
analysis of the facts known at the Bureau appeared to centered
in the New Jersey area. After observations in this regard were
furnished to the field, investigation culminated in his being
located in the Camden, New Jersey, area, The investigation which
followed resulted in the arrest of 20 individuals on 8/22/71 in
the act of destroying and stealing draft board records in the
Camden Federal Building. The individuals arrested included Peter

ordi (an original member of the East Coast Conspiracy to Save
Lives), Paul Couming, and John SwingLish, both indicted at
Harrisburg for criminal contempt after refusing to testify
before the EASTCON FGJ when granted immunity from prosecution,

PH_1211-S determined Swinglish was the "recruiter" for the

Washington, D. C., plots in the EASTCON case. It is to be
expected that other individuals who are EASTCON activists will
also be indicted at Camden, The evidence already obtained in
that case discloses other EASTCON activists were responsible for
the Selective Service draft board break-in at Trenton, New Jersey,
5/21/71. Likewise, the obviously coordinated Buffalo, New York,
draft board break-in on the night of 8/21-22/71 involved
sympathizers of the EASTCON movement,

Much of the foregoing represents the continuing
intelligence coverage of the Berrigan antiwar movement, absolutely
necessary to the Bureau's interests, aside from the important
development of admissible evidence in the EASTCON prosecution,

ruled on by the court, and many others are still outstanding. In
anticipation of the court ruling on a motion for Discovery and
Inspection as provided by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
the Government, in order to expedite such matters, has previously
allowed the inspection of certain evidence in this case, This
has been done at various field offices under Departmental super-
vision, The lists of evidence made available, other arrangements
and details with regard to such inspection, has been handled by
guidance from the Bureau, Approximately one half of this evidence
has thus far been inspected with hundreds of items of evidence
still to be inspected in Washington, D, C., Philadelphia, and
Baltimore. The court has ruled in favor of the defense broadly
interpreting the right of Discovery and Inspection, particularly
as to photographic evidence, Laboratory, and Identification
Division reports. The Department has requested such material



Bes

the Division,

to be made available for inspection at the Department in the
near future, and this project is being coordihated by the Bureau.
There are estimated approximately 1,000 photographs submitted by
1l offices, The Laboratory (document examinations) and Identification
Division reports will be voluminous since they include not only
those prepared in connection with the EASTCON case itself, but
also all of those prepared in connection with six Selective
Service Act cases included as conspiracy charges in the EASTCON
indictment, It is apparent that the evidence from the three
offices covering these six Selective Service Act cases will be
voluminous and require close coordination by the Bureau with the
Department into the EASTCON case for a successful prosecution

at trial,

-At present, two supervisors are assigned full-time, and
one supervisor spends .approximately one half of his time in the
supervision of this case, This investigation continues to generate
a great deal of paper not only on the substantive case but also in
connection with the other matters directly related thereto. It
is anticipated the time of two and a half Agents will be the absolute
Minimum required to effectively handle this matter through the
completion of the trial. Depending upon the volume of work
generated by necessary requests of the Department in the pretrial
and trial stages, additional manpower may be necessary iid various
times, i

The Inspector has specifically inquired as to when these
men can be reassigned to other work. It is to be noted that since
the return of the superseding indictment on 4/30/71, two other
full-time supervisors have been reassigned to other work within

It is not anticipated that the two supervisors assigned
full-time to this case will be released prior to the conclusion
of the trial in this matter,

The two principal informants in this operation

have received the "Order of Lenin,“ with the title "Hero

of Soviet Labor" from the Soviets, This is the highest

award given civilians by the Soviet Union and was given

our sources for their "invaluable contribution to the
international communist movement." i

. Continued high-level penetration of the CPUSA
represents a sustained major accomplishment, At the time

of the last inspection, we had 11 informants who were

j officially members of the CPUSA National Committee, This
number remains the same. In addition, we have another informant
who is an ex officio member of the National Committee because
'of the sensitive nature of his Party assignments. This latter
source is also a member of the Political Committee which, in
effect, runs the Party. This top-level coverage is responsible
for furnishing information regarding policy-making matters

on a day-to-day basis as they occur.

FOREIGN INFLUENCE AND PRO-CHICOM UNIT

: A prime responsibility of the Bureau and the intel-

: ligence community is to develop intelligence relating to efforts
| of foreign hostile governments, organizations, and individuals
who influence, direct, or dominate the domestic subversive and
extremist movements. There has been considerable evidence
compiled over the years of this foreign influence. Since the
last inspection, the following noteworthy achievements in our
‘investigations relating to foreign influence have been
accomplished:

1. In March, 1971, a coalition of leftist individuals

including subversives and extremists under the sponsorship of
the Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam, American Friends

i Service Committee, and Fellowship of Reconciliation traveled to
Paris where they were in contact with the North Vietnamese and
other elements antagonistic to the U.S. We developed two informants
to participate in this travel and as a result, identified all
170 péople in ‘attendauce, their activities, contacts, and
objectives, All information developed was afforded dissemination
to appropriate Government agencies and we were commended by one
intelligence agency for the excellent coverage.

2, The World Peace Council is the leading Soviet-—
dominated international effort to discredit and subvert U.S.
domestic and foreign policy. Upon determining the World Peace
Council would hold a General Session in Budapest, Hungary, in
May, 1971, an effort was made to obtain informant coverage, An
informant was developed for the travel and coverage resulied in
the identification of all American participants including the
Communist Party, USA, delegation and the activities of these
individuals at the meeting. All pertinent documents relating
to the Conference were obtained, as were the contacts and
activities of American subversives at the Conference. Widespread
dissemination of intelligence relating to this Conference was
made and both the White House and Central Intelligence Agency
favorably commented on its exceptional value.

3, During the past six months, the Unit has afforded
specific coverage to the travel of U.S. citizens to three hostile
communist countries: North Vietnam, North Korea, and Communist
China, All individuals traveling to these countries during 1970
have been identified and, where pertinent, investigations have

been opened, Careful records have been maintained regarding
U.S. citizens who have visited these countries during the
current year and arrangements have been made to receive
quarterly reports from another intelligence agency which will
enable us to double check our files and insure cases are opened
on visitors to these hostile countries, when warranted, We feel
this is a strong achievement because, as noted below, we have
developed evidence that Americans are currently being recruited
for intelligence assignments in these countries.

4, Early in 1971 it was determined an informant who
had participated in Venceremos Brigade travel to Cuba had
established a rapport with North Koreans in that country...

Through intensified investigation of the Revolutionary
Union (RU) and Venceremos Party (VP), we have been able to identify
over 200 hard-core Marxist-Leninists who have all indicated
violence-prone propensities, Of particular note is the fact
that our closely supervised investigations in this area have
developed an informant on the National Committee of the, RU and
have resulted in identification of an extremely 7 milieant RU
group in Eugene, Oregon. The Department has expressed extreme
interest in our RU investigation and has indicated a desire to
explore prosecutions at the first opportunity.

7 In late 1970 Mark Lawrence Wefers, the student body
president of the University of New uemeenine, traveled with a
National Student Association group to North Vietnam. While

there he made recorded speeches encouraging the servicemen in

to be.conducted and the Department has indicated an interest to
prosecute Wefers, under the sedition statutes at an early date.
This will represent the first prosecution under the sedition
statutes since the 1950's.

A suit was instituted against the Director and two
Special Agents of the Memphis Office seeking preliminary
injunction against the FBI and punitive and compensatory
damages amounting tpover $100,000 against the Director and
the Agents, The suit was instituted by the Southern Conference
Educational Fund claiming harassment and intimidation of war
resisters, Former communists, extremists, and subversives
were involved as plaintiffs. In July the plaintiffs dropped
their plea for a preliminary injunction. Excellent information
identifying the principal plaintiff, on whose statements the
false allegations were based, as having a criminal record
involving furnishing of false information and theft, has been
furnished to the Department as well as the fact that he is the
cama! subject’ of a current outstanding State Bench Warxvaat. It is
anticipated when this matter is argued before the court, the
plea for punitive damages will be dropped, much to the embar-
rassment of the communist subversives and extremists involved.

The Unit endeavors to keep track of all efforts to
discredit the U.S. military effort through organization of
antiwar coffeehouses, oriented groups, and publications. Last

- January we intensified investigation on Peoples House, a
coffeehouse operated by subversives in Clarksville, Tennessee,
Excellent information has been developed, all the principal
subversives participating have been identified, and details
have been furnished to the Department and interested military
intelligence agencies, The House Committee on Internal Security
has taken an interest in this coffeehouse and it is expected to
be the subject of a Congressional hearing which will publicly
expose the involvement, tactics, and objectives of the extremist
elements behind this. subversive endeavor.

KLAN AND WHITE HATE GROUPS UNIT 4-E

t

The FBI has continued its investigation of 18
Klan-type organizations including 255 klaverns (units)
throughout the United States which had a slight increase
in membership from 4,300 a year ago to approximately
4,500 at present. This increase in membership is primarily
attributed to renewed interest in Klan-type organizations
brought about by Federal directives regarding school busing
in order to achieve racial balance in public schools.

In recent months the UKA and Shelton have under-
taken a major campaign aimed at harassing thé FBI. The
initial step of the campaign was named by Sheiton as
“Operation Polly" in which he sought to obtain polygraph
machines to help "weed out FBI pimps." We have taken steps
to assure he is not successful by instructing our key
informants to talk it down and, if necessary, to ultimately
refuse to take such an exam. We have also discreetly
contacted a potential supplier to be assured we are aware
of any positive actiontaken by Shelton in this regard.

Further, as a result of our hard-hitting investi-
gation and interviews of Kiansmen, Shelton, printed a series
of articles in the monthly UKA publication "The Fiery Cross,"
entitled "Exposing the CIA and FBI," in which Shelton
vehemently attacked the Bureau as a "Gestapo-like police
force" and the Director as "a man who has sold out his
country for his prided FBI." Picketing of the Norfolk and
Richmond FBI Offices to protest interviews of Klansmen by
FBI Agents as infringement of the individual rights of Klan
members also took place recently and Klansmen were instructed
to attempt to secure photographs and identities of our Agents
in order that this information could be published in'The
Fiery Cross" with the-intent that the FBI be embarrassed and
our Agents transferred. This information was furnished to
appropriate field offices and to the Department. To date
our Agents have avoided having their photographs taken by
the Kian.

Violence has been noticeably absent among Klan-type
organizations during the past year. This is due in the main
to our effective informant program. We have been able to
direct our informants to positions of leadership throughout
the country, and these informants have been extremely success-
ful in forming nonviolent Klan policy. We have also been able
to keep local authorities advised of potential Klan violence
in time to thwart such action.

Since last inspection, informatYon was also developed
through Joan Gourley, former mistress.of/Robert DePugh, con-
cerning murder of Walter Barnes, former Winutemen member who
was allegedly murdered and buried by DePugh while in underground
hide-out in New Mexico prior to his arrest by the FBI. _Gourley
traveled to New Mexico to locate gravesite in company of local
authorities who granted her immunity. Gravesite disclosed only
four small bones identified by coroner as coming from foot of
human victim. Gourley furnished statement to New Mexico
authorities and, in addition, stated DePugh had indicated in
duly, 1970, while imprisoned, that body had been removed from
original gravesite, but she did not believe him at that time.
Local District Attorney, While believing Gourley's story, felt
prosecution not feasible without body. During July, 1971,

=R, a Minutemen informant of this Bureau furnished
information and explosives reportedly to be utilized in the
bombings of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division (ATFD)
and Internal Revenue Service offices in the California area,
resulting in the arrest of several individuals, including
informant, by ATFD, thus preventing the bombings.

sgfon a of Minutemen,

Subsequent to last inspection, dissemination has
been made concerning weapons, possible violence and demon~
strations of these groups which has resulted in the curtailment
of activity and disenchantment with the Klan and other white
hate group organizations in some areas. In several cases,
confiscation of weapons haS been made by ATFD of the Treasury
Department based on our information. We have also made
apprehensions of extremist subjects for illegal possession
of firearms following. conviction of a felony, a violation
under our jurisdiction.

. SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT ~ WEST

The primary objective in this Unit has been and
continues to be the goal of overcoming the threat to American
institutions presented by violence prone extremists, such as
those within the revolutionary Weatherman organization. This
Unit and the Special Investigation Unit - East, supervise
security investigations of the Weatherman group and its
individual members. Through coordination with the General |
Investigative Division, which has handled certain criminal
investigations involving Weatherman members, and with the Special
Investigative Division, which has supervised the investigation
of Weatherman fugitives, substantial accomplishments in the
task of neutralizing these extremists have been achieved. A
number of Weatherman leaders have been indicted on Federal
charges involving violations of the Federal Anti-riot, gun control
and bombing statutes. Many leaders and activists in the
Weatherman organization have gone underground and the organization
is currently composed of a few hundred adherents including
those underground and above ground. Its underground existence
and the fugitive status of its leaders have isolated Weatherman
‘from the mass of American youth. Consequently, Weatherman
has experienced a considerable reduction in strength, based
on the number of its present adherents and its, influence

_among young people.

Weatherman, though a small group, continues to be
extremely dangerous in view of its violent and destructive
tactics. It is noted that Weatherman has claimed credit for
a number of bombings, including the bombing of the national
Capitol building on 3/1/71.

Weatherman continues to receive intensive investigation.
In recent months, a Weatherman bomb making factory has been
discovered at 1038 A Pine Street, San Francisco, California, and
subsequent investigation there has uncovered a number of persons,
including attorneys, who are acting in a covert support role
for Weatherman. The Department of Justice has now indicated in
a letter to the Bureau that it will institute Federal Grand
Jury proceedings concerning activities at this Pine Street address,
with the prospect of further indictments and further discourage-

ment of Weatherman sympathizers. Approval has been obtained
for this Unit to supervise this Pine Street case in view : 4
of its intimate connection with the overall Weatherman
investigation. Approval has also been obtained for this Unit
to supervise a New Left - Violence case in Tucson, Arizona,
which involves Unlawful Possession or Receipt of Firearms
(UPRF) charges. This Tucson case concerns five New Left
extremists, three of whom have now been indicted by a Federal
Grand Jury. Two of these have been apprehended and the
third is a fugitive. Another subject in this case has been
sentenced to jail for contempt of court for refusing to
testify before the Grand Jury.

An example of the.salutary effect of vigorous
investigation and prosecution of New Left extremists is seen
in the Seattle area. There, a radical group called the
Seattle Liberation Front (SLF), which was composed of
former Weatherman members, had fomented continuing violence. |
Then SLF leaders were tried in Federal court on anti-riot 1
charges. 14 trial ended in a mistrial but the SLF leaders
were cited for contempt of court. Since that mistrial in
December, 1970, SLF has been disbanded and most SLF members
have left Seattle. There has been a noticeable reduction
in New Left violence in Seattle.

In the several cases referred to above, it is noted
that in each instance information crucial to the prosecution
of New Left extremists was provided by New Left informants.

In recent months significant accomplishments were
made in a case involving two extremists in Ohio through the
use of a tesur installation. These two extremists were
Nancy Kurshan and Howard Emmer, who were leaders of the
Youth International Party TYEE) Between February and June,
1971, a tesur covered the activities of Kurshan, Emmer, and
others with outstanding success. This source provided advance
information concerning the plans of May Day leader, Rennie Dayis.
for the recent May Day national action. The source also provided
extensive information on planned demonstrations and strikes at
Kent State University on May 3 and 4, 1971, the anniversary of
the killing of Kent State students by the National Guard in
May 1970. This source furnished information concerning
activities and movements of suspects in the Capbom case and other
New Left extremists. This source also developed information on
plans for the Women's March on Washington on April 10, 1971.

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 57



As a result of dissemination of advance information developed
by this source, authorities were able to further control
these demonstrations and reduce the violence arising out of
such activity.

With reference to the complicated Weatherman
investigation, much progress has been made recently in the
development of information on the technical aspects of the
actual operation of the Weatherman underground, particularly
its use and methods of obtaining false identities, its
courier system, its use of radical attorneys in covert
support roles and in the movement of its support personnel.
Effort is continually being made to develop néw techniques
and approaches to facilitate this investigation. A "stop
index" program in NCIC, for Bureau use only, concerning
extremists on Priority I of the Security Index was initiated
in June, 1971. This program enables our field offices to
receive prompt notice by teletype when police agencies make
inquiries about these subjects. In addition, new procedures
have recently been devised whereby the Identification Division
can better disseminate to the field arrest information on
Security Index subjects for whom no fingerprints are on file.
This is accomplished by periodic submission by the field of
Security Flash Notices to determine if fingerprints have been
received since the last check,

VENCEREMOS BRIGADE

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT - EAST 4-E

The Venceremos Brigade (VB) came into being
June, 1969, as a coalition of representatives from various
New Left organizations including Students for a Democratic
Society, Young Socialist Alliance, the militant Black
Panther Party and a supporting cast of Old Left organiza-~
tions including the Communist Party, Progressive Labor
Party and Socialist Workers Party.

Four contingents have traveled to Cuba since
November, 1969, The first group was composed of 216
young Americans who obtained their own transportation to
Cuba in defiance of the State Department ban on travel to
that countyy. These young revolutionaries were returned.
to Canada on 2/12/70 at the expense of the Cuban Government
which converted a cattle boat into a makeshift troop ship.
The second contingent of 687 sympathetic American youths
were loaded aboard this boat for its return trip to Cuba.
This group, like the first contingent, worked in the
| sugar cane fields until its return by the same means of
transportation on April 28, 1970. In August, 1970, the
third contingent of the VB, made up of 407 persons,
journeyed to the Isle of Youth where they participated
in a Cuban agricultural experiment of planting and ferti-
-lizing citrus trees, This group returned to the U. S.
mid-October, 1970. The tourth contingent of 433 young
Americans traveled by air to Cuba during the last week of
March, 1971, and were returned to Canada by Cuban ship on
May 29, 1971.

Each group worked approximately 74 hours a day,
5h days a week, and in their free time were afforded the
opportunity of absorbing communist propaganda offered by
the Cubans, North Koreans and North Vietnamese. They
were reminded by the Cuban camp director that they were
here to show "solidarity with the socialist struggle, to

facade of the U. S. imperialist monster,'".

Each of the more than 1500 brigade members has
been the subject of a security investigation which includes
the identification and obtaining of background data as
well as a personal interview with each brigade member.
These investigations are being made to determine the
immediate danger presented by these young revolutionaries
and also to ascertain the long-range role they will take
in the revolutionary movement in the U. S. Upon comple-
tion of the investigation and the interview of each of
these individuals, the field must recommend either the
inclusion or noninclusion of the subject in the Security
Index. In addition the field must continue to report
every 90 days for a period of one year on the activities
and whereabouts of each brigade member.

The intelligence responsibilities of the Bureau
in regard te the VB have been handled through the placing
of Bureau informants in the ranks of the various contingents.
Accurate on-the-scene reports concerning the training and
activities of these groups in Cuba have been furnished to
the intelligence community and factual responses have been
made .to congressional and other legitimate inquiries re-
garding these young supporters of the Castro Regime, As

_ a result of our investigations, more than 275 VB partici-
pants have been placed on the Security Index and it has
been noted that about 25% of those individuals currently
being intensively investigated as extremists in the New
Left section, are ex-VB members. -

Plans for a fifth contingent of the VB have been
formulated. This new group is tentatively scheduled to
depart for Cuba in early January, 1972, and is to be
comprised of 225-250 individuals politically oriented to
the socialist cause.

SUBVERSIVE INDIVIDUALS - NEW LEFT UNIT

Among the primary responsibilities of this unit
is the identification and investigation of individuals who,
because of activities or affiliation with one or more
violence-prone revolutionary groups, are dangerous or
potentially dangerous to the internal security of the
nation. In most instances, this unit handles initial
stages of the investigation and carries it through to
completion, In some instances where individuals are
determined to be of an extremist nature, those cases
are referred to the units in this section handling
extremist cases, At the conclusion of each investigation
or at the phase of the investigation when it is determined
that the individual therein could be considered a danger
to thé internal security of tite counixry, an evaluation is
made and, if appropriate, the individual's name is
included on the Security Index,

The immense volume of cases handled in this
unit is clearly exhibited by the fact that since the
last inspection approximately 5000 cases have been
handled in this unit. To be exact, 5418 cases have
-been opened and 4951 cases have been closed,

PROTEST AND TROTSKYIST GROUPS UNIT

This Unit is responsible for the investigation of
antiwar protest groups and key activists connected therewith,
as well as the Eastcon case, Accomplishments of the Unit
worthy of note are as follows:

EASTCON

As a result of our investigation of the plots to blow
up the underground tunnels housing the heating system servicing
Government buildings in Washington, D. C., and to kidnap a
high Government official, an indictment was returned at
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on 1-12-71 covering six individuals
as defendants and seven unindicted co-conspirators, Our
investigation into this matter continued, and on 4-30-71 a
superseding indictment was returned at Harrisburg which added
two additional defendants and reduced the number of unindicted
co-conspiraters to four, In addition, five individuals have__.
been cited for civil contempt for refusal to testify before
the Federal Grand Jury regarding this matter, and four individuais
have been indicted for criminal contempt. By letter dated
2-25-71 to the Director, Assistant Attorney General Robert C,
Mardian advised of his appreciation for cooperation extended
by the Bureau in this case and singled out the efforts of six
members of the Domestic Intelligence Division, as well as two
Agents of the Philadelphia Office.

Of paramount importance to the successful prosecution
of this case is our principal witness, Boyd Frederick Douglas,
He testified before the Grand Jury in January" Tovl,~anm
subsequently assumed a new identity and has been living under
appropriate cover in Des Moines, Jowa. Inasmuch as he is a
witness rather than an informant. tie Department is primarily
responsible for his welfare and his cover, We maintain liaison
between the witness and the Department in order to insure that
the Bureau's interests are properly looked after, The.death
fo) i ants ther in July,1971, created a situation
whereby the informant's identity and location could have been
ascertained by irresponsible members of the press, Through
the concerted efforts of the Omaha Office, the informant and
his wife attended the funeral with no adverse effects. Assistant
Attorney General Mardian, by letter dated 7-21-71, praised the
high degree of proficiency of five Agents of the Omaha Office
in protecting the identity of the witness,

The development of a highly placed informant,
PH 1223-S, within the pro-Berrigan forces is also a significant
“gecompiishment, This individual has gained the confidence of
leaders in the Berrigan movement and is privy to information
not available from any other source. The informant has furnished
a wealth of information regarding fund raising and strategy 7
and tactics planned by movement leaders to propagandize
their position and to attempt to gain public support for
the Berrisan cause. In the course of this coverage, the
informant furnished information concerning plans of the group
for action in the event parole was not granted to Philip and
Daniel Berrigan on 7-28-71, He also furnished plans o he
group to mount an attack on the Bureau of Prisons which
culminated in a hunger-work strike at the Federal Correctional
Institution, Danbury, Connecticut, on 8/6-7/71, This action
resulted in the transfer of eleven inmates to the Medical

’ Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri. We

furnished plans of this proposed action to the Bureau of
Prisons, and in a letter to the Attorney General dated
8-11-71, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons noted that
the action of the inmates confirmed our intelligence reports
received several weeks prior.

PH1223-S also furnished information concerning the

intention of the group to embarrass the administration by
having Daniel Berrigan prepare the text for a.Mass. composed
by wusical @onductor Leonard Bernstein, This,Mass is to be
part of the dedication ceremonies for the Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts in Washington, D. C., and is to be performed
on 9-9-71, The words prepared by Daniel Berrigan were to have

- been im Latin and were to follow an antiwar theme, The group
anticipated the President and high ranking administration
officials would applaud the work and subsequent publicity
would be to the effect that they had applauded antiadministration
views. This information was furnished the White House and,
according to the news media, the President has declined to
attend the ceremonies on 9-9-71,

PH_1223-S has also furnished information showing the
Berrigan supporters are interested in obtaining classified
material such as that publicized by niel Sberg in an
effort to embarrass the Government, The individual who is
to attempt to get these papers is Linda Shaw Finlay, an
ardent supporter of the Berrigan cause. Her target is the
Lyndon B, Johnson Library at the University of Texas, Austin,
which is the repository for former President Johnson's papers.
We have a separate espionage investigation underway regarding
this situation.

ANTIWAR MOVEMENT

This Unit is responsible for the |investigation of
dissident protest groups in order that their potential threat
to the internal security of the country can be assessed, This
includes development of informant coverage and the dissemination
of timely intelligence information, as well as possible
violations of Federal laws.

The organizations concerned are the communist
Socialist Workers Party (SWP), its youth group, the Young
Socialist Alliance (YSA), and the Student Mobilization
Committee to End the War in Vietnam (SMC) which is controlled
by the SWP/YSA, All three of these groups utilize the National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC) as a vehicle to project their
antiwar message. The Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice
(PCPJ), continuation group of the New Mobilization Committee
to End the War in Vietnam (NMC), also exercises considerable
influence in the antiwar movement and is a target for
infiltration by the Communist Party, USA (CP). The May Day
Collective (MDC), organized by Rennie Davis, is a militant
group which split from the PCPJ following the May, 1971,
demonstrations in Washington, D. C. “Aiso of considerabie
interest is the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) which
came into prominence during the Washington demonstrations,
We have disseminated on a daily basis hundreds of reports and
memoranda concerning the activities of these and other groups,
as well as information regarding principal activists, This
dissemination has been augmented by the preparation of several
CINALs pertinent to specific demonstrations, conferences, or
‘activities,

Of particular value has been our coverage of national
conferences and conventions sponsored by various. groups which
are used to plan future antiwar activity and demonstrations.
We have been able to cover these sessions most effectively and
have furnished other interested Government agencies with
advance information of their plans. Included in these
conferences were the following:,

2/19- 21/71. -- National student antiwar conference,
Washington, D., C., sponsored by SMC.

NEW LEFT GROUPS UNIT

Included in the work of the New Left Groups Unit are
the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) factions (with
the exception of the Weatherman), other New Left campus
groups, the Key Activist program, New Left Movement reports,
New Left publications, and the maintenance of a library of
research material on the New Left for use of Bureau |
officials in connection with approved speaking commitments.

In 1969, the Worker Student Alliance (WSA),
Weatherman, and Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) factions
of SDS split into separate groups. Accomplishments concerning
Weatherman are reported elsewhere in this survey, The RYM
faction of SDS is now practically defunct. Currently,
the largest faction of SDS is the WSA faction, which is
dominated by the pro-Chinese Marxist-Leninist Progressive
Labor Party (PLP).

Approximately twenty, Bureau informants attended the
SDS/WSA National Convention in Chicago, December 26-30, 1970.
This convention was dominated by PLP controlled leadership;
however, dissent was widespread, much of which was led by
our informants, Since the last Inspection, this dissent has
spread further and has resulted in additional factionalism
within the ‘SDS/WSA.

During the past winter, the SDS/WSA has continuously
attempted to inject itself into labor disputes without success,
due mainly to factionalism. The objective of the SDS/WSA is
to build ties with workers inasmuch as in the old Marxist-
Leninist tradition, they view the students-workers as the
vanguard of the revolution. In this regard, the SDS/WSA set
up a Summer Project with the twofold objective of a massive
recruitment program and the fostering of a general strike,
nationwide, . through infiltration of industry and unions. We
have been on top of this program from its inception and have
kept all interested Govemment agencies advised of developments
on a continuing basis. In addition, again largely due to
factionalization, the SDS/WSA Summer Project program has not
had significant success in any of its twenty-one target cities,

New Left Movement reports submitted quarterly by
each field office have enabled us to furnish interested
agencies timely and informative documents on the activities
of the New Left movement. This is a substantial contribution
to the objective that responsible Government officials
be alerted concerning the nature and extent of this aspect
of subversive activities and the threat it presents to our
democratic society. :

By conducting an intensive review of many New Left
publications which range from the pornographic to‘the clearly
revolutionary, we have determined the leadership of these
publications; their subversive activities and whether or not
they urge violence; and sources of funds, Since these
publications are the voice of the New Left and are influencial
in recruiting youth, pertinent factors concerning them are
disseminated to interested officials and agencies, Since
our review of these "underground" publications has revealed
many of them frequently come into being and become defunct
within a short time, we are alert to the birth of new publications
by perusing various underground news service lists as well
as other documents and books which report new publications in
this field.

A library of research material on the New Left is
maintained for use of Bureau officials in connection with
approved speaking engagements before Government officials and
responsible citizens. In this manner, we have assisted these
Governnent.officials and responsible citizens to more fully
“understand the subversive and anarchist manifestations of the
New Left movement.

Through the key activist program, we have focused
investigative attention on the leaders of the New Left movement .
with the aim of prosecuting these leaders under appropriate
statutes, Federal or local, wherever possible, This program
has proved successful in that we have been able.to closely
follow the activities of these individuals and furnish interested
agencies and high Government officials with information concerning
their subversive and agitational activities. Of particular note
is the fact that more than half of the 73 individuals designated
as key activists are subjects of some type of prosecutive action.

Section Chief W, A, Brahigan
Espionage Section

The primary mission of this Section involves
counterintelligence operations against Soviet-Bloc Intel-
ligence Services (SBIS). Counterintelligence, by definition
and in‘practice, is a reaction to initiative displayed by
a hostile intelligence service. This factor largely inhibits
bold and aggressive initiatives on our part and the major
part of our efforts is spent in routine, programmatic, non-
remunerative work and patient, painstaking analysis of
information developed. Positive counterintelligence
achievement in the final analysis depends on the ability to
detect and exploit in a timely fashion circumstances
which arise naturally--contriving, to the extent this is
feasible, to anticipate, encourage, or modify circumstances
to cur own advantage or the disadvantage of the SRTS,

In this perspective, the accomplishments listed
below are most noteworthy, These are highlighted by the
current operation of four defectors-in-place and the
identification of three ree, "illegal" agents since the last
inspection. From both a quantitative and qualitative view-

oint, these successes represent an extremely high level
. of accomplishment in these two vital areas.

In keeping with the Inspector's instructions,
brevity will be stressed in the examples portrayed. Security
and the "need-to-know" principle also requires. limitation
of detailed information on many cases discussed. These
matters, however, are identified sufficiently so that any
additional data desired may be obtained from the individual
file. Accomplishments cited are restricted to the most
Significant and/or representative.

I. Defectors-in-Place (DIP)

The most valuable asset which counterintelligence
can acquire is the recruitment of a Soviet-bloc official
who is an active intelligence officer or who otherwise has
access to intelligence information. Such a source can
produce information of incalculable value not obtainable
from any other source. Highest priority and emphasis is
assigned to cases which have such potential. Although we
‘have had success in this area in the past, at the time
of the last inspection we had no DIP, Currently we are
operating four. sources,.in,,t! S.C cate; Ory, which are briefly

| II. Double Agents : 4

& double agent is an individual under Bureau
control who has been recruited and given intelligence assign-
ments by SBIS. Double agent development is given great
emphasis since this is a primary method to obtain valuable
information concerning hostile intelligence operations, °
targets, techniques and personnel. At the time of the last
inspection, this Section listed 138. double agents, 296 _
potential double agents, and 49 inactive double agents.
Figures for August 1, 1971, are 133, 291, and 47 for the
respective categories. Apart from Statistics, the most
significant accomplishment lies in the quality of the double
agent operations which has.developed since the last inspection.
A representative number of these situations are set forth
below.

“CHOWLINE is a double agent which began in 1958.
Through the years this operation has grown steadily in
significance and productivity. The ~source.has. been..paid.

The SNOOD operation involves a Soviet agent who
was uncovered through information received’ ih 1962 from a DIP,

III. Soviet Illegal Operations

These operations are staffed by officers or agents
of SIS who enter the U. S. and operate without any connection
with the legal bas@s, i. e., the intelligence residencies
staffed by intelligence personnel under cover of official
position located at the Soviet Embassy and Mission to the
United Nations. In view of the completely clandestine nature
of these operations, they are the most difficult to detect.

We have in the past achieved some success in detecting several
illegal operations. Since the hast inspection, three such
agents have been identified in the cases outlined below. |

IV. Counterintelligence and Special Operajtions

In this category, on a highly selective basis
we take initiative in actions which are designed to disrupt,
deter or otherwise disadvantage the operations of SBIS. We
employ our own resources and whenever feasible, those of other
U. S, agencies. Brief examples of activity in this category
since the last inspection are set forth.

influence on the choice of properties made available to the

that the Soviets are settling on a property considered by us
to offer the best advantage for counterintelligence coverage.

V. Prosecutive Action

One objective of counterintelligence investigations
is prosecution. Since most intelligence officers have ~
diplomatic immunity, this objective is rarely attained.

A Soviet intelligence officer operating under cover
of employment at the United Nations Secretariat has requested
classified information from a double agent regarding the
F-14 aircraft being manufactured by Grumman. The facts have
been presented to the Department of Justice and Department of
i State and both have approved prosecutive action. The Soviet
was scheduled for arrest during May, 1971, but this action

been on summer leave and recently returned to the U, S.

We are currently se&king concurrence from the White House
so that arrest may take place at the next meeting scheduled
for 9/13/71.

VI. Dissemination of Significant Intelligence Data

One of the products of our counterintelligence
operations is the development of intelligence data of interest
to other U, S, agencies. The following are examples of
Significant data which has been disseminated on a high level
since the last inspection.

“1. Dissemination to National Security Agency
regarding an unknown subject connected with that Agency who
was reported to us as cooperating with the KGB.

2. Dissemination to Atomic Energy Commission
concerning a high official of that-Agency who was being
cultivated by the Soviets for intelligence purposes.

3. Dissemination to State, CIA, and the White House
of information we developed concerning the delivery to the
Soviet Embassy on June 17, 1971, of a package containing a
copy of the "Pentagon Papers."

4, Dissemination to White House, CIA, and State
concerning an intelligence approach made by the Soviets to
a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee.

5. Dissemination to the White House of information
we , developed concerning the receipt by Soviet intelligence
‘of information concerning Dr.. Kissinger’ s trip to China prior
to the release of this information by the President. This
information was obtained from an American agent of the KGB
in esnane tone DC. :

VII. Soviet Information Collation System (SICS)

SICS is the system in which we have utilized
automatic data processing equipment to record data
concerning Soviet officials in the U. S, Since the last
inspection, a continuing expansion has been made in this
system and we are looking to the inclusion of Satellite
personnel in the near future. This is a time consuming
project which holds a tremendous potential, already partially
realized, for reducing administrative work and making our
overall investigative operations more efficient and successful.

EXTREMIST INTELLIGENCE SECTION

The significant accomplishments of the Extremist
Intelligence Section can be seen most clearly in the accomplish-
ments through our investigative efforts as well as the pecompetsht
ments achieved through the extremist informants.

Since the last inspection we have supervised the
"Newkill Special.'' This case involves unprovoked attack on
two New York City (NYC) police officers, 5/21/71, by two Negro
male assailants, Both officers were shot and killed. Prior
to this shooting on 5/19/71 two NYC officers were machine gunned
and seriously wounded as they attempted to stop a speeding car
occupied by Negro males, Anonymous letters were received by
nevs media in ng eredit for these shootings.

ela

The Director met with the President and the Attorney
General regarding the killing of the two officers as this
incident received nationwide publicity, The Director ine erniered
an all-out effort be made to effect Bureau solution.

Tnhtensive investigation has been conducted to identify
assailants with investigation conducted abroad and in over 40
field offices. Over 2000 people have been interviewed. The
Identification Division has compared the fingerprints of over
700: persons with latent evidence and the Laboratory Division has
conducted about 400 separate examinations of ballistics and
other type evidence in this case,

Since its inception, we have concentrated on members
of the violence-prone Black Panther Party (BPP) as suspects.
This has paid off since four persons were arrested in NYC on
6/5/71 while attempting an armed robbery. Two of the individuals

arrested were Bureau fugitives. We had previously identified
the two Bureau fugitives from fingerprints from material
submitted by them to news media in May claiming credit for the
murders, The two Bureau fugitives, Richard. Moore. and

Edward Joseph, were BPP members who were reportedly in Algeria.
A machine gun utilized in armed robbery and in possession of
Moore was determined to be same weapon used in machine gunning
of two NYC police officers on 5/19/71. Moore has been indicted
by Queens County, New York, Grand Jury for attempted murder of
the two officers, He and Joseph remain in custody of local
officials,

Our intense investigation has in some respects
decimated the BPP in NYC. We have kept them on the defensive
and in hiding. Our investigation and interview program has
resulted in developing a witness who is an associate of the
prime suspects in this case,

est ce, she
identified seven Panthers who participated in killing a Negro
BPP leader in NYC. Of the seven, three had previously been
arrested in the above-mentioned armed robbery 6/5/71. The

to the paranoia of Newton causing him to ate complete chaos -
within BPP national headquarters. Newton, in an effort to
justify his position and to criticize Cleawer and his dissident
followers, claimed that Cleaver and hiS“appetite for violence
were the root of all of the BPP problems im the recent past.
Newton maintained the BPP was really nonviolent but was led
“astray by Cleaver and that he, Newton, will now return the
organization to a position of nonviolence and community work,

In summation, our COINTELPRO efforts split the BPP,
cut off their supplies of outside funds and created chaos within,
“~ As a result of the ever increasimg information being
reported by our informants regarding the acquisition of weapons
by black extremist groups, on 5/17/71 an airtel was sent to all
SACs setting forth instructions regarding the handling of such
information, This airtel sets out in detail the possible gun
law viclations under the National Firearms Act, State Firearms
Control Act and the unlawful possession or receipt of firearms.
The field was instructed that we have secomdary investigative
jurisdiction in such matters and that infowmation developed by
our informant coverage regarding possible gun law violations
should be handled by us and vigorously pursued looking to the
ultimate prosecution of the black extremists. involved.

The Black Afro Militant Movement (BAMM) was organized
in the Miami Division in the early part of 1970, The leader of
this group was Alfred Dwight Amos Feathersitone, an articulate
black extremist and an admitted communist who had in the past
visited Fidel Castro in Cuba, Through the outstanding informant
coverage developed by the Miami Office and the aggressive investi-
gative techniques used, this dangerous extremist organization
has been completely destroyed and is no lemger a factor in the
extremist activities in the Miami area. Owr informant coverage
developed information’ regarding the participation by BAMM leaders
and members in fire bombings in the Miami area including a
bombing at the University of Miami, Through this coverage and
other investigations an excellent criminal case was developed

ad



regarding the teaching and demonstrating of explosive devices
by BAMM leaders, In December, 1970, Federal Grand Jury in Miami,
Florida, rendered indictment charging Featherstone and two other
i BAMM leaders with violation of the new antiriot laws, All
i three subjects have been found guilty in Federal court Miami.
Featherstone and Charles Riley, Jr., another BAMM leader, have
been sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for
periods of four and two and a half years respectively. The
third subject, after testifying for the Federal Government, was
placed on probation.

Earlier this year, one of our informants being operated
by the Richmond Office reported on a conspiracy by leaders of
. the Washington, D. C., Chapter of the BPP and leaders of the
Richmond Information Center. (RIC), an affiliate of the BPB to
steal and transport weapons from Richmond, Virginia, to
Washington, D. C. This informant reported on the theft of such
weapons in Richmond and their subsequent illegal transportation
to Washington, D. C., by this group.

As a result of this information developed and other
investigation, two of the BPP leaders in Washington and three
RIC leaders in Richmond, Virginia, were subsequently indicted
by a Federal Grand Jury.

Our informant testified in Federal court as the
principal Government witness resulting in the conviction of
‘the two Washington, D. C., leaders and two of the RIC leaders,
The trial for the fifth individual involved is scheduled for
8/20/71 in Richmond, The sentencing of the convicted leaders
is’ scheduled in the near future,

As a result of the conviction obtained based on the
‘excellent information furnished by our informant, the RIC has
been completely destroyed and conviction of the two Washington
BPP leaders has been highly significant in curtailing the
activity of the Washington, D. C., BPP Chapter.

The continued operation and development of extremist
informants has resulted in a steady flow of valuable intelligence
information, which information has brought about the apprehension ~~

have been responsible for bringing about the arrest of 630
individuals: since the last inspection, 145 of these individuals
were Bureau fugitives, as well as being responsible for the
recovery of $327,760.53.

Some of the concrete examples of our informant and
investigative accomplishments can be seen in the following:
7 Ghetto informants in June, 1971, developed information
concerning the motive and circumstances leading up to an
unsuccessful attempted five bombing of a Jackson, Mississippi,
police vehicle; identified a local subject involved in assault
and theft of a revolver of a Cincinnati, Ghio, police officer,
which information resulted in the arrest of the subject by the
police department; furnished information which was instrumental
in arranging for the surrender to FBI Special Agents of a 16-
year-old male who was badly wanted by the Buffalo Police
Department in connection with a shooting imcident.

Omaha informants advised of the location of several
weapons which were owned by members of the Black Revolutionary
Party in Omaha and which were subsequently seized by the Omaha
Police Department; Houston informants furmished information which
was the basis of a raid by the Houston Police Department on the
headquarters of the Peoples Party II, which resulted in the
arrest of nine individuals, eight of whom were charged with
burglary and firearms theft, and the recovery of numerous
weapons,

Detroit extremist informants adwised concerning a
BPP member who was involved in a holdup killing in Detroit,
He also advised that this individual was carrying the same

Docid: 32989638 Page 83



pistol used in the killing, which enabled the Detroit police
to arrest the BPP’ member, recover the pistol and determine that
this weapon was used in the killing referred to above.

A Tampa informant furnished information concerning
identity of two Negro males who placed a fire bomb in a garage
in Tampa, Florida.

A Miami ghetto informant was instrumental in obtaining
advance information concerning problems in a local high school.
It is noted there was a walkout by students at this high school
and as a result several Negro students were arrested. A
Washington Field informant obtained information concerning
Stokely Carmichael's trip to the United States from Africa and
this information was verified by the New York Division.

Detroit informant provided information which saved
two lives. This informant, who was a member of the BPP, was
instrumental in saving the lives of two BPP members who were
being disciplined by the BPP and his information when furnished
to local police was responsible for arrest of seven BPP members
who were Charged with kidnaping and assault to do bodily harm.
less than murder.

A Memphis informant furnished information which
prevented a. shootout between members of the BPP chapter and
the Memphis Police Department,

Extremist intelligence information gathered through
our informants and investigations makes up a major portion of
the Bureau's sophisticated document which is disseminated to the
White House and other high-level Government agencies. This
document captioned "FBI Summary of Extremist Activities" furnishes
the White House and other agencies with a digest of the extremist
problem in the United States.

The quality.of our informants can also be judged by
the fact that since the last inspection 16 Special Agents have
been recommended for either incentive awards or letters of
commendation for their work in developing and handling these
informants. In addition, 11 extremist informants were given bonus
awards for valuable information furnished and services rendered.

In relating to the accomplishments of the Extremist
Intelligence Section, comment must be made ¢oncerning the
contributions regularly being made by the Inspection Division
during their analysis of extremist matters iin the various field
divisions. In addition to acting upon infommation furnished to
them by this Section, the Inspection Staff, through their on+the-
spot review of extremist matters in the fiield, are often able to
detect weaknesses not apparent at the Seat ef Government and
offer constructive assistance to the office involved in
strengthening their operation.

The information furnished in tke Inspection reports
is used by this Section to do a comprehensiive analysis of every
field office operation and to furnish the results of the analysis
to the field divisions by communications eaptioned "Administrative
Review.'"' These reviews have been most helpful in strengthening
the various field office operations. :

Since the last inspection, infommant coverage has
improved in the Boston, Charlotte, Cincimmati, Cieveiand, Newark
and New Haven field divisions and this impmovement can be
attributed in part to the Inspector's analysis of the above
operations,

In other positive moves we have arranged for a
friendly newspaperman, who writes for Spaniish~languas. ‘@ newspapers
in New York City, to prenare feature articles on Saban dereRtOrS -
who have settled happily in the United States. In conjunction
with State Department, we received concurrence of Secretary
General U Thant of the United Nations to bar two strong~arm-type
Cuban intelligence officials from United States territory even
though neither had ever been in the United States or performed
any known acts of violence against United States property or
citizens. Mr. U Thant pointed out that this was a landmark
action, as the United States had never before presented a case
which warranted entry denials in the history of the United Nations.

Our around-the-clock coverage of Cuban intelligence
activities has allowed us to identify, with a minimum of effort,
the various extremist, New Left and subversive Puerto Rican
independence leaders who maintain contact with the CMUN. Two
valuable double agents in the Miami area have gained the complete
confidence of a top Cuban collaborator based in New York City,

Party (PSO), Armed Revolutionary Independence Movement (MIRA),
Armed Commandos for Liberation (CAL), and the Nationalist Party
of Puerto Rico (NPPR), the oldest of the revolutionary groups.

; MIRA and CAL, in particular, are dominated by native Puerto
Ricans who had many years of sabotage training in Cuba, returned
| surreptitiously to Puerto Rico and led the wave of major
explosions which heavily damaged United States installations

in metropolitan Puerto Rican areas. Property loss resulting
from such acts of violence since 1967 has been estimated at over
$15 million with an economic loss of over $100 million,

In addition to the previous apprehension of

Filiberto Ojeda Rios, Cuban espionage agent and leader of several
major bombing expeditions, the FBI was instrumental in the :

arrest. by Police of Puerto Rico (POPR) of Narciso Rabel

Martinez and Roberto Jose Todd Pagan, two other long-time espionage
agents with extensive sabotage training in Cuba, Following

j the deaths of two police officials and an ROTC cadet during a
riot in March, 1971, at the University of Puerto Rico, one of

Our sources in the Puerto Rican indepam dence field
have given us information concerning subversives traveling
between Puerto Rico and New York City to transport incendiary
devices for use in acts of sabotage. Alise a close rapport has
been established between POPR and our San Juan Office in recent
months. The resulting arrests and seizure of explosives, as
well as intelligence material, have slowed down the acts of
violence noticeably during the first seven months of 1971.

“We are quite apprehensive that the National Conference
of Governors has been scheduled for Septenber 12-15, 1971, at
San Juan. Realizing the volatile nature of the Puerto Rican
independence movement, we have directed an airtel to all offices
pointing up the powder keg situation and asking that every effort
be made to obtain advance information concerning planned acts
of violence to be carried out against participating officials.

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS 4-H

BACKGROUND AND DATE OF INCEPTION i

Studies pertaining to the handling of individuals
who in time of an emergency would represent a potential threat
to the national security began prior to World War II. The
actual program began in June, 1940, and dealt mainly with
lists of individuals considered for detention in the event of
a threat to the national security.

SCOPE AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES

This program is field-wide in scope. The goal of the

Security Index (SI) Program is the identification of individuals
who because of their membership and activity and/or association
with subversive organizations are dangerous or potentially
dangerous .to the internal security of the country. The program
includes the collection of sufficient information relating to
the activities of such individuals to justify their apprehension
and detention in the event of a national emergency. Another
goal of the SI is to maintain it in a current status in the
event immediate implementation is necessary to minimize
possibilities of espionage, sabotage and subversion. The SI is
broken down into three Priority groupings, the cards being tabbed

. either Priority I, II or III in accordance with the relative
factor of dangerousness. Most dangerous individuals are tabbed
Priority I.

POSITIVE RESULTS ACHIEVED SINCE LAST INSPECTION

By way of background, in February, 1969, as a matter of
temporary expediency, the Executives Conference approved a
moratorium on certain Security Matter - Communist investigations
and periodic report writing in Priority II and Priority III
Security Index cases}; moratorium later extended to January 1, 1971.
By memorandum October 29, 1970, from the Executives Conference
to Mr. Tolson, approved by the Director, the moratorium was
lifted. At the time there were approximately 10,690 individuals
on the SI who were of the Priority II and IiI types. Virtually
no investigation had been conducted regarding approximately 7,000
of these individuals since the imposition of the moratorium in

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM Gah 4-H
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS

February, 1969. Many of these persons had changed residence
and/or employment and their whereabouts were unknown. It can
thus be seen that the lifting of the moratorium was an aggressive,
timely and precise step toward fulfilling our current
responsibilities, especially in knowing the whereabouts of these
individuals. Implementation was directed by airtel November 3,
1970, to all offices, and in doing so we took a realistic step’

in permitting the field to stagger the reopening of these cases
so that they would be spread out over the period November 3, 1970,
to June 30, 1971, This was considered essential in view of our -
approximation that it would be necessary to reopen about 7,000

of the Priority II and III types. Our experience in the nine
months since moratorium was lifted has demonstrated the wisdom

of the lifting of the moratorium as it was found that many of
these subjects had changed residence and/or employment, thus
necessitating substantial investigation to determine new
whereabouts. There are presently pending a number of these cases
for the precise purpose of determining whereabouts.

EXTENT AND NATURE OF CURRENT SUPERVISION
Responsibility for administrative handling of the SI
rests with the Special Records Unit of the Research Section,
Responsibility for individual cases rests with appropriate
supervisory personnel. I personally follow this matter closely
. to insure‘it is current and that necessary changes are made
where desirable. This program receives constant supervision.

JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUANCE

This is a major internal-security program based upon -
Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and is to be
implemented in the event of a national emergency to minimize
acts of espionage, sabotage and subversion.

FREQUENCY OF EVALUATION

The SI Program is constantly being re-evaluated. The
most recent justification is contained in memorandum from
R. D. Cotter to Mr. C. D. Brennan dated January 12, 1971.

BACKGROUND, DATE OF INCEPTION AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES

This program was initiated in September, 1964,
for the purpose of counteracting and neutralizing white
extremist organizations, leaders and adherents. During
period January, February, and March of 1971, there were
17 field offices involved in this program and as specific
Situations arose, other divisions participated.

THE UNITED KLANS OF AMERICA, INC., (UKA)

Under the leadership of John Paul Rogers

Realm of Florida, the UKA”in thet area
has become increasingly aggressive in recent months
and has been afforded generally favorable coverage by
the news media in Florida. In addition, Rogers has been
infuriated by recent interviews of Klansmen by the FBI
and has been increasingly vehement in his verbal attacks
against FBI-Agents. As a result, Regers has heen considered
a primary subject for counterintelitgence activity. Tampa
has instructed its informants to discredit Rogers wherever
possible without creating suspicion.

wJobn,,baul Rogers,above has also recently
devoted practically all of his energy to the UKA to the
exclusion of his wife and job, having hired a retired

“ parber to handle most of his business; yet he purchased

a $19,000 home. Tampa is seeking ways to create suspicion
of Rogers by other Klansmen.

Imperial Wizard, Robert M. Shelton of the UKA
has for sémé-TiMe DEST 'atCOMDTING “Wrthoue Success, to
purchase polygraph machines in order to "weed out FBI
informants." Chicago, with Bureau authority, interviewed
Walter Van De, Werkin, past president of the American Society
of Polygraph Examiners, in an effort to ascertain who we
should logically contact in the polygraph field to prevent
Shelton and the UKA from purchasing this machine. Interview,

which was handled in a discreet manner and in complete

confidence, revealed that we should not expand this endeavor
further at this time due to the large number of individuals
and companies involved. In the event we learn of a specific
firm or individual the UKA desires to contact for this
purpose, further consideration will be given to this matter,

During March, 1971, Washington Field Office

was authorized to interview Robert J. Lee, admitted
National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP) official
allegedly involved in raid on Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam to cast suspicion on Jesse Clayborn
Stephens, self-styled east coast coordinator for Minutemen
and to disrupt cooperative relationship between respective
organizations and effect possible defection of Lee.
Interview appeared to be successful in that rapport was
established with Lee which may be beneficial in the future. 4
Lee volunteered information concerning NSWPP matters not 4
previously known to the Bureau and indicated he would be
receptive for further contacts. It is felt this matter j
has long range potential.

THUMBNAIL SKETCH PROGRAM : 4-H

This program was initiated and authorized by
SAC Letter 53-72 (J) dated October 27, 1953, to insure
that the field is using current characterizations of
subversive organizations and to provide uniformity in
characterizing such organizations. Those characterizations
deemed to be of field-wide interest are now to be

the practice, in accordance with approval of suggestion
in memorandum J, J, Casper to Mr. Mohr dated December 7,

SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM 4-H
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY AND NEW LEFT ORGANIZATIONS

At the time of the last inspection in January,
1971, the Internal Security Section handled informants
only in the basic revolutionary organizations and related
groups. There was no Security Informant Unit as such,
informants being handled on subversive organization
desks. On June 16, 1971, a Security Informant Unit was
formed and this Unit now handles informants in the
New Left field as well as in basic revolutionary
organizations and related groups.

At last inspection there were 264 member informants
in the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA); at present there are
226, a decrease of 38. At last inspection there were_31
mem Tiber ° informants in the Socialist Workers Party (SWP);
at present there are 48, an increase of 17. As of
duly 31, 1971, date oF i latest monthly tabulation, the
Sectifity Informant Unit handied a iotai of 793 security
informants and 671 potential security informants, a total
jof 1,466. This includes 630 informant cases transferred
(from the New Left Sectiém to the Security Informant Unit
in the Internal Security Section on June 16, 1971.

There has been continuing recognition of the
fact there must be no letdown in maintaining adequate
informant coverage, However, economy has increasingly
become a primary factor. In line with the President's
message on August 15, 1971, tightening economic controls
and our continuing efforts to hold down expenditures, the
field is being instructed by letter to all offices to cut
down payments to security and extremist informants and
sources by five percent. To assure uniformity and fairness
in the application of thiscutback throughout the field,
‘each office was instructed to follow this formula:

Total expenditures,for all such informants and sources
"for the six month period ending July 31, 1971; reduce
‘this total by five percent; divide the resulting figure
by six (months). The resulting figure is to be the
guideline for each office.

HEM: cb 8/19/71
ee,

This instruction is not a mandate to reduce
payments across the board on all informants and sources.
_ Offices are to evaluate expenditures within the
‘determined guideline amount and adjust individual
payments accordingly.

These instructions do not mean the Bureau will
cease authorizing payments where new informants: are
developed and fully justified. It is incumbent on all
offices to evaluate these matters within the guideline
figure, There are to be noincreases in payments to
informants and sources for the next 90 days, in line
with the Director's instructions.

Each office was instructed to advise the Bureau
by return airtel of the guideline figure determined. By
close of business September 30, 1971, the Burcau is to be-
advised by each office that these instructions have been
complied with and that expenditures have been reduced by
the five percent factor. On the basis of our expenditures
during the past fiscal year, the five percent reduction
will result in an annual saving of approximately $129,000.

Security informant development receives continuous
“supervision. It is not technically a program justified
semiannually or annually but rather a fundamental procedure
in our investigative operations that requires and receives
vigorous day to day attention.

The Security Informant Unit maintains an up-to-date
index of Security Informants and potential security informants.
It correlates personal and operating data (such as name,
address, code, file and symbol number) concerning these
informants, which it receives from the Division's investigative
sections, and places such material on FD-348s, three by five
ecards that constitute the index, This index is maintained
on discontinued as well as current informants.

New Left Extremists

By letter to all field offices dated 2/13/70,
the field was advised that the violence-prone Weatherman
group planned to go underground and to direct "strategic
sabotage" at military and police installations. The field
was instructed tovigorously investigate the Weatherman group
and to advise appropriate local police agencies of Weatherman
plans. By airtel to all offices dated 3/15/70, tne field was
advised of Weatherman plans for extreme violence. The field
was instructed to locate and identify Weatherman communes
and activists. Intensive investigation of Weatherman leaders
was ordered.

By airtel to Chicago dated 3/24/70, that office
was instructed to initiate investigations and interview all
individuals arrested in Chicago during a Weatherman rampage
in October, 1969, where such investigations had not already
been undertaken, More than 280 persons had been arrested,
most of whom were either members of or closely associated
with the Weatherman group. In connection with cases of
bombing or arson which appeared to have New Left or black
extremist connotations, SAC Letter 70-18 (C), dated 4/7/70,
captioned "New Left and Black Extremist Terrorism - Bombing
Matters" provided the field with guidance. In those cases
where no Bureau substantive jurisdiction exists or where the
Depaxtment has advised that no investigation is warranted,
the Bureau must be immediately advised concerning involvement
of subversive groups or individuals suspected in the incident
and recommendation made concerning additional investigation.

By teletype to all offices dated 4/17/70, the
field was advised of specific areas of investigations to be
made against New Left terrorist groups and standards were
set for investigations of communes, The field was also
instructed to develop necessary informant coverage of these
communes and groups so that advanced knowledge of planned
violence could be obtained, preventive action initiated, and
prosecution undertaken where possible.

By Bureau airtel to all offices dated 5/13/70,
instructions were given concerning implementation of investi-
gations of New Left’ terrorism which were begun with available
manpower and further implementation was to be as rapid as
possible. All adherents to the Weatherman ideology which
advocated a Marxist-Leninist revolution and the use of
terroristic tactics in furtherance of revolution are made
subjects of these investigations. These subjects are to be
considered for Priority I of the Security Index and when
placed on Priority I, the Bureau must be advised every 45
days of their current residence and other pertinent information
developed. Each office was instructed to submit a monthly
airtel ‘beginning 6/1/70 setting forth (1) identities of
communes or organizations; (2) number of cases opened during
month on individuals in these categories; (3) total number of

“eases under investigation; (4) informant coverage utilized
against these communes and organizations; and, (5) a brief
summary of New Left violence in area during preceding month
and action taken.

By Bureau airtel to all offices dated 5/15/70, the
‘field was furnished a copy of a Departmental letter concerning
specific areas of interest to the Department of Justice in
campus disorders looking toward possible prosecutive action,
The field was specifically instructed to develop information
concerning New Left involvement in campus violence and
concerning agitational activities prior to and during violent
campus disorders by subversive groups.

By airtel to all offices dated 7/16/70, the field
was advised that New Left terrorism was continuing through
bombings, arsons, and other violence and that each Special
Agent in Charge must personally insure that sufficient
personnel are assigned to handle these matters and to
investigating New Left terrorists.

SAC Letter 70-46 dated 9/1/70, captioned "New Left
Movement - Violence, Internal Security - Miscellaneous
(Weatherman)" instructed the field to develop better informant
coverage of Weatherman and. other terrorist groups. By airtel
to all offices dated 9/3/70, captioned "Attacks on Police,
Extremist Activity" the field was instructed that in view of
increased attacks on the police, it could be expected there
will also be physical attacks against the FBI and that all
Special Agent personnel should be fully cognizant of this
possibility. To ohtain comniete intelligence data concerning
any extremist influence in attacks on police, the field was
instructed to institute appropriate investigation when
information was received concerning an impending attack on
police and informants directed to develop full facts concerning
the attack.

SAC Letter 70-48 (B) dated 9/15/70, captioned "New
Left and Black Extremist Terrorism ~ Informant Coverage"
instructed the field to immediately institute an aggressive
policy of developing new productive informants who can
infiltrate terrorist groups.

SAC Letter 70-57 (C) dated 10/13/70, captioned "New
Left Movement - Police Training Matters" advised the field
that in view of recent violence by New Left terrorists, the
Bureau will consider requests for SACs or ASACS to brief
local law enforcement command and supervisory personnel
regarding New Left extremism and violence. These briefings
would be at law enforcement meetings and conferences where
attendance is restricted to full-time duly constituted law
enforcement officials.

AW 55151

Bureau airtel to all offices dated 9/9/70 advised that
a special single fingerprint file on Weatherman fugitives and
other New Left terrorists has been initiated. The field was
instructed to submit to the Bureau the identity of New Left terror-
ists whose fingerprints should be included in this special file.

By airtel to all offices dated 6/15/71 the field was
advised that a new "stop index" program had been instituted in
the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). This program is
for Bureau use only and concerns extremists who are in Priority I

“of the Security Index and who are not already carried in the

NCIC Wanted Persons: file. Through this program, the field
obtains prompt notice from NCIC by teletype whenever a police
agency makes inquiry concerning one of these extremists, which
enables the field to better follow the activities and movements
of extremists.

By SAC Letter 71-37 (E) dated 8/10/71, captioned
"Security Flash Notices Regarding Security Index Subjects" the
field was advised of new procedures which will enable the
Identification Division to better disseminate arrest information
on Security Index subjects for whom no fingerprints are on file
in the Identification Division. This is accomplished by
periodic submission by the field of Security Flash Notices
(FD-165) which determine if fingerprints of a Security Index
subject have been received since the last check and if so, a
stop is placed in the fingerprint record to assure that the
field is advised of all subsequent fingerprint submissions.
The Security Flash Notice is periodically submitted at different
intervals depending on the priority of the subject's Security
Index status.

Intensified investigation of New Left extremists
has led to numerous prosecutions and indictments of extremist
leaders, To provide further guidance for the field in these
matters, SAC Letter 71-10 (E) dated 3/9/71 and captioned
"Security Informants - Judicial Matters" advised the field of
procedures to be followed in handling informants who are
developing information on ‘New Left groups and individuals who
are in contact with these New Left activists or with their
attorneys. .

gel

Docld:32989638 Page 116 : MA



The Department of Justice has advised that
informants may be utilized in furnishing information
concerning the location of fugitives or the location of
other New Left activists even though such utilization may
resilt in the informant inadvertently learning of defense
plans or strategy. The field has been instructed that when
an informant is present in a conversation between an attorney
and an individual under indictment he should, if possible,
leave, or if this is not possible, he is not to report the
substance of any such conversation to the FBI. Since radical
attorneys are deeply involved with New Left extremists, not
only in their legal defense but in their other activities, the
above procedures are most helpful in extremist investigations.

Intensified investigation of New Left extremists
has severely disrupted their operations and limited their
influence. Numerous Weatherman leaders have been indicted
and subsequently arrested or remain in fugitive status.

The Weatherman organization has gone underground and is
isolated from contact with the mass of American youth. The
number of adherents to Weatherman is significantly less as a
result of these prosecutions and investigations, The
Weatherman group continues to be most dangerous in view of
its adherence to violent tactics and continuous effort is
peing made to develop new approaches and techniques to

_ facilitate this investigation.

‘Key Activists

By airtel to all offices dated 10/23/68, the Key
Activist program was intensified and expanded. The field
was instructed to maintain high-level informant coverage on
individuals designated as key activists in the New Left
movement. At the present time there are 73 key activists
under investigation.

A Key Activist album containing photographs and
biographical data on each key activist has been furnished to
all offices. This album is maintained in a current status
and has proved invaluable in following activities and travel
of New Left key activists. By airtel dated 3/10/69 to all
offices the field was instructed to submit reports each
three months on key activists. The field was also instructed
to prepare communications suitable for dissemination when
these key activists filled a speaking engagement and whenever
_they made statements indicating a propensity for violence or
urging student agitation. The purpose of this program is to
secure testimony and evidence concerning violations of
statutes particularly where these key activists are involved
in campus disorders. The field has also been instructed to
develop detailed information on sources of funds used by
key activists and to closely follow their travel, Handwriting
specimens of each key activist must be obtained and placed
in the Nationai Security file maintained py the Laboratory.

f The key activist program has been most successful.
We have been enabled to closely follow the activities of
these individuals and to provide other interested agencies
with pertinent information. It is noted that more than half
of the individuals designated as key activists are subjects
of some type of prosecutive action.

The NUC, composed of radical professors, graduate
students and teachers, is committed to the growth of a

revolutionary socialist movement in the U.S., with educational

Division, office of origin, was directed to the fact’ that the
NUC claimed 42 national chapters plus fifteen pre-chapter
groupings, with 675 national members, and anticipated further
- expansion, Chicago Division was instructed to insure appro-
priate leads were set out to confirm the existence of all

NUC chapters and to conduct appropriate investigations in
accordance with Bureau instructions relating to investigations

territories and to follow these reports with a report each
quarter, similarly captioned, showing the status of the
movement and its activity during the preceeding three-

month period. These reports have enabled the Bureau and

the submitting field offices to assess the potential
dangerousness of the New Left movement, determine from one
document the divisive or unifying issues within the movement
and whether the activity is increasing, decreasing or
continuing at the level indicated in the previous report.
Since individual reports have not been required on the many
small local New Left groups in each territory in lieu of
adequate LHM, inclusion of pertinent data concerning these
groups in the quarterly report alleviates the need for
regularly submitted reports and puts the activities ina
better perspective within each field division. Additionally,
these reports have presented on a continuing basis a clear
cut picture of the entire New Left movement which identifies
its leaders, sources of funds, propaganda outlets, and shows
the extent to which the New Left movement has been influenced
by domestic and foreign subversive elements. This program
has enabled the Rurean and the field.to make a self analysis
of all facets of our investigation of the New Left movement
so we may expand and intensify our investigation of those
phases indicating a need thereof. These reports have served
as a valuable research tocl at the Bureau and afford the
individual field divisions an opportunity to evaluate the
direction and success of their investigations in the New Left
movement. ;

New Left Movement ~- Publications

By letter dated 11/5/68 to all offices under the
caption of "New Left Movement, Publications, Internal Security -
Miscellaneous," the field was instructed to cover the
principal propaganda mills of the New Left which are
described as "underground" newspapers. This survey has
been particularly beneficial in view of the fact that the
New Left, to a great extent, depends on the written word
to spread its propaganda. The survey has disclosed that
in excess of 200 papers are published on a regular basis
with a central theme being criticism of the "establishment"

- in general and law enforcement, the draft and the Vietnam
War in particular. Youth, particularly students, are the
main target of these publications, ‘which are effective
vehicles for agitation and recruitment in that they reach
a large portion of the student population. Additionally,
the survey has revealed the papers are in poor financial
condition and often miss publication datesdie to lack of
funds. Funds are generally received from advertising,
subscriptions, donations and benefits. Volunteer labor is
used in most instances and many times the staff of the
publication resides collectively in a commune.

A survey of underground publications is currently
being conducted by the New Left Groups Unit, the purpose of
which is to determine if trend information can be developed.
_Trend information is being developed during the course of
this survey and information obtained will be incorporated
into an educational-type document, Based on this survey, it
appears the New Left movement is at a crossroads and is
groping for a sense of unity and direction. This unity,
iff developed, will no doubt include. future activity in
political channels. These newspapers, which are often written
in the foulest language, are a major influence on the youth
in this country and are the strident propaganda ‘voice of the
New Left movement.

Informant Development - New Left Groups

Bureau airtel to all offices dated 11/5/70 concerning
informant development in New Left groups directed each SAC

forth the weaknesses and productive steps being taken to
rectify these weaknesses. As a resultaclear-cut view of

analysis of where programs needed shoring up. Those offices
found to be deficient in their coverage were directed to
submit periodic communications detailing their coverage

and setting out what steps are being taken to increase the
coverage in terms of quantity and quality.

The Counterintelligence Program ~ New Left was
discontinued by Bureau airtel to all offices dated 4/28/71
in view of the fact that sensitive intelligence techniques

on SAC authority except in those instances where the subject is
under 21, currently a student, professor, has some connection
with an institution of learning of is a journalist. HSureau

Bureau airtel to all offices, dated 5/15/70, instructed
the field to immediately intensify investigations of all VB
returnees from Cuba, ascertain their whereabouts, conduct prompt
interviews and submit current reports with Security Index recom-
mendation.: In view of rebuttable presumption of at least sympathy

“to a violent Marxist-Leninist revolution and willingness to

participate in that revolution by these VB members, the field

was also instructed for one year to advise the Bureau every 90
days of whereabouts and activities of Priority II and IiI and

non-Security Index returnees, In case of Priority I Security

Index subjects, this information is to be furnished the Bureau
every 45 days.

Current Bureau instructions require development of
adequate informant coverage of Strategic Air Command and
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Bases of the United States
Air Force (PROSAB) to insure that our investigative responsi-
bilities in the sabotage, espionage and internal security fields
can be properly discharged, Semiannual reports are submitted by
each office having a Strategic Air Command Base or an Inter-

group of the Peoples Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and was
the main force behind massive civil disobedience in Washington, D.C,
There has been a definite split between the two groups over the
question of violence which is favored by MDC, Following regional
conferences in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and Washington, D,C,, MDC
held a national conference in Atlanta, Georgia, 8/13-17/71 to map
its future course and to plan antiwar activity for the Fall of 1971,
By airtel to all offices dated 7-26-71, the field was instructed
to determine the existence of MDC organizations in the respective
divisions and to furnish all available information to Bureau by
8-30-71 with comments regarding extent of coverage, Potential for
violence by MDC was emphasized, and the field was alerted to
possibility of violations of Federal laws,

May Day Collective (MDC)

Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW)

Letter tc ail offices dated 8-3-71 instructed each office
to initiate a survey to determine existence of VVAW. This action
was necessary in the light of increasing indication that the VVAW
may be a target for infiltration by subversive groups such as the
Communist Party, USA, and the Socialist Workers Party and their
respective youth groups, VVAW has also been involved in aiding and
financing U.S, deserters, including false identity papers and
reportedly in one area has a cache of arms. VVAW has become
increasingly active in the antiwar field and must be considered
a prime target for infiltration,

East Coast Conspiracy to Save Lives (EASTCON)

This is an extremely important investigation requiring
constant supervision and review at the Seat of Government. It
involves plots to blow up the tunnels, housing, heating systems
servicing Government buildings and to kidnap a high Government
official, Conspiracy aspects of selected Selective Service
break in cases are included in the indictment as well as violations
involving the contraband and issuing threatening communications
statutes. The Eastcon case is the subject of a write-up in
Section 4-A-4.

SUBVERSIVE INDIVIDUALS - NEW LEFT GROUPS UNIT

Bureau airtel to all offices,dated 11/3/70,
instructed the field to resume verification of residence
and employment in Priority II and Priority III Security
Index cases and to resume periodic report writing in
proportionate number in Priority II Security Index cases
so that all such cases would be opened by 6/30/71.

As a result, annual reports in Priority II
Security Index cases are being received pursuant to
existing instructions and where verification of
residence and employment shows a change, appropriate
changes are being made on Security Index cards,

- Bureau airtel to all offices, dated 11/4/70,
instructed the field to initiate investigation of
all SDS members as well as members of procommunist,
militant New Left-type campus organizations who follow
SDS advocacy of “revolution and violence and that
each individual investigated should be considered
for the Security Index, Results of investigations in
these cases are being received and supervised in this
section. Activities in each instance are waluated
and where it is found the subject could be considered
a danger to the internal security of this country in
| the event of a national emergency, the individual's
| -name is included on the Security index,

SAC Letter 71-35 (D),dated 7/27/71, instructed
the field to discontinue use of Internal Security -
Miscellaneous, Security Matter - Miscellaneous, and
Security Matter - Anarchist as characters in security
investigations. Instructions for using new characters
were set out. This action was necessary in order to
facilitate routine of mail at the Bureau and to more
properly describe the characters of security investiga~
tions. : :

and has a sound basis. Past experience has shown that
Soviet intelligence will use the same modus operandi
continuously, if successful.

DESECO PROGRAM : | 4-H
Bufile 105-71688

1. The Deseco Program (program for development
of selected contacts to be directed against Soviet~bloc
officials) originated as result of conference between field
and Bureau representatives in December, 1957. Purpose is
to select and develop individuals to be placed in contact
with Soviet-bloc intelligence officers as a means of (1)
penetrating Soviet-bloc intelligence; (2) exerting control
by keeping intelligence officers occupied with running our
sources; and (3) assisting in possible defection of bloc
intelligence officers.

2, WNineteen offices are engaged regularly in
this program and other offices on oecasion conduct investi-
gations to develop background on selected sources, Greatest
activity has been in New York, Washington Field, Chicago and
San Francisco which cover Soviet-bloc establishments. The
18 offices are authorized to conduct “sounding-out" inter~
views of prospective sources without prior Bureau authority.
Follow-up interviews with potential Deseco sources are con~
ducted on a UACB basis. New York and Washington Field
submit monthly progress letters summarizing the results of
the program, The other 17 offices submit summaries on a
semi-annual basis.

3. Between the last inspection and July 15, 1971,

‘approximately a 6-month period, 2G, Deseco subjects were placed

in contact with Soviet-bloc officials, Of these, four have
developed to the status of ‘security informants or Gouble
agents.

4, This program is correlated in the Espionage
Section, Coordination Unit by Svecial Agent Lish Whitson,
The program is handled in the field by Special” Agents
assigned to Soviet-bloc investigations who are familiar
with the habits, weaknesses and intelligence targets of bloc
personnel and are qualified to select and develop the type
of individuals needed in this program. Unusual or sensitive
cases in this program are routed to the Division front office
for approval, All rules, policies and procedures regarding

5, This program is re-evaluated on an annual
basis. It was last justified by memorandum W. A, Branigan
to C. D. Brennan, dated March 29, 1971, Limitations on
other investigative techniques have underscored the value

“of this program demonstrated in the individuals developed
as security informants or‘double agents. Selectees have
enabied us to uncover and pin-point Soviet-bloc intelligence
targets, identizy Soviet-bloc intelligence officers and
furnish information of value in considering defection
approaches, During the month of March, 1971, a double
agent, developed through the Deseco program, was instru-
mental in enabling the Bureau to identify a Soviet illegal
operating in the guise of a graduate student in

a. ake City. Direction of this program against Soviet-
bloc intelligence otzicers will continue to he vressed to
insure improvenent in our coverage of Soviet-bloc intel-
ligence operations.

EAST-WEST EXCHANGE PROGRAM
Bufile: 105-42300 4-H

This program originated in 1955 in an attempt to
provide internal security safeguards regarding ‘the admission
of Soviet and satellite nationals. Soviet intelligence regards
the visits of East-West Exchange Agreement participants as
opportunities to promote intelligence activity.

As a result of the 1970 Inspection revisions were
: made in the investigative action taken in this field. The
change was made as a reult of other manpower commitments.
SAC Letter 70-25 provided that no investigations will be
conducted of groups or individuals participating in the East-
West Exchange Program in the absence of any information
indicating affiliation with Soviet intelligence. Bufiles
are checked on all Soviet participants and where information
is developed showing intelligence affiliation, cases are then
opened and the field instructed to conduct necessary investiga-
tion.

During the period of January-June, 1971, 982
individuals were scheduled to enter the U. S. under the provisions
of this exchange program and of this number, we had information
indicating Soviet intelligence affiliation on 23, of these
individuals.

,With regard to Soviet exchange students there are
‘currently’ 32 in the U. S. Based on information furnished by
defector sources and investigations of Soviet students previously
in the U. S., we have determined that Soviet intelligence
utilizes these students in an intelligence capacity, principally

_ as spotters. In view of this, we afford these students active
investigation. We have also found that a number of these students
return to the U. S. for assignment at one of the Soviet establish-
ments and in most instances, contacts which they made while in
the U. S. as students are generally reactivated. The case of
Yuriy Aleksandrovich Gostintsev is an example of an individual
tering the U.S. under the East-West Exchange Program as a
graduate student and engaging in intelligence activities.

EXTREMIST INTELLIGENCE SECTION ‘

BLACK EXTREMIST MATTERS

Racial matters investigations were intensified through
establishmént of the Racial Intelligence Section on 10/2/67.

By memorandum dated 7/14/71 it was recommended, and
the Director approved, that the Racial Intelligence Section
would, thereafter, be known as the Extremist Intelligence Section
and the character of cases supervised would be changed from
Racial Matters to Extremist Matters, This action was taken as
the majority of extremist activity in U.S, is not based solely
on racial hatred but based on a desire to overthrow U.S.
Government by revolution.

This section handles extremist matters investigations
involving black extremist organizations and individuals.
Objectives are to identify organizations and individuals that are
involved in extremist activities, that advocate or had actually
committed or have conspired to commit acts of violence, that
advocate revolutionary or terrorist activities and that violate
Federal laws, The dangerousness to the U.S. of such individuals
must be assessed and a determination made as to whether they
should be included in the Security Index. The extent of
foreign influence or influence of the Communist Party or other
domestic revolutionary groups among black extremists, especially
black extremist organizations, is a prime objective. To
accomplish these objectives, sources have been developed who
can furnish quality and timely information concerning individual
extremists and extremist organizations, Such sources likewise
have forewarned us of potential violence and enabled the Bureau
to stay on top of the black extremist situation. These sources
have assisted the Bureau in executing its responsibilities of
alerting local authorities, and of keeping other Government

agencies dependent upon us for information informed of
pertinent developments and advance intelligence, including
data concerning potential violence.

Our informant coverage has made it possible for us
to keep a constant flow of information going to the White House,
the Attorney General and other Government agencies having an
interest. Additional information pertaining to black extremist
intelligence matters and the survey regarding "Potential for
Racial Violence'' is set forth under data furnished by the
Research Section,

“Reports submitted by the field are thoroughly reviewed
at the Seat of Government to insure that essential information
is being obtained on a timely basis and that it is being promptly
‘disseminated in the field, as well as at the Seat of Government.

The activities of black extremists continue to place
a heavy demand upon the Bureau's manpower and resources,

_ There are numerous black extremist groups throughout
the nation, the majority of which are local in nature and
relatively small in membership. These groups, however, either

. directly or indirectly, advocate defiance of the law, hostility
toward constituted authority and, in some instances, advocate

| - outright destruction of Government and establishment of a
Marxist-Leninist form of Government. The activities of these
groups constitute a constant threat to the internal security

-of the country through their propensity for violence, hatred
of and outright opposition to our form of Government.

BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT
Bufile 157-8415
4-H

Black extremism is concentrated in organized activities
of 64 groups, some of which have chapters in major cities through-
-out the U.S. The five major nationwide groups have chapters
in 139 cities. Hard-core membership in these black extremist
groups totals in excess of 8,300. This membership figure,
however, disguises the real following of extremist groups in
black areas of our cities and the extent of influence and
leadership they exercise. This real support, especially from
young blacks, is surfaced during confrontations with police
and the Establishment. In fact, hostility toward the police
by black extremist groups, as well as by black youths, continues
unabated in many of our major cities.

Set out hereinafter are summaries concerning the key
black extremist organizations that are presently under active
and penetrative investigation.

Computerized Telephone Number File (CINF) was expanded
on 2/26/71 to include telephone numbers of black, New Left and
_other ethnic extremists, As a result, black extremist groups,
black extremist Security Index subjects and individuals included
in the Black Nationalist Photograph Album have been entered
into the CINF, This has proven to be extremely valuable investiga-
tive tool and has saved the field considerable investigative
time in ascertaining subscribers of telephone numbers since
"hits" are made on 15.5 percent of numbers checked against the
file.

iu The Black Nationalist Photograph Album (BNPA) was
established on 3/8/69 to assist in identification of militant
black extremists who travel extensively.

| The BNPA is maintained in all offices. BNPA includes

| a photograph and biographical data on leaders of black extremist
organizations, militant black nationalists who are known to travel
and black extremists who are Bureau fugitives. Each office pre-
pares a form on such individuals within its territory and the
form is then furnished to the Bureau and all offices where it is
maintained in a complete album, In the event of travel by any

of these individuals, the office covering the area being visited
already has a photograph and biographical sketch of the individual
immediately available. The album is also furnished to the Legats
in Ottawa and Mexico City and to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
and Central Intelligence Agency, in the event of foreign travel.
Over 470 extremists are currently carried in this album. Informa-
tion concerning fugitives was included to insure each office has

F a photograph and biographic sketch immediately available for its

j use in conducting investigation to locate or apprehend them.

To insure broad circulation among investigative personnel
and to serve as an avenue for greater utilization of informants,
especially extremist sources, we initiated the Black Extremist
Bureau Fugitives List in June, 1970. This list, which is prepared
quarterly and sent each field office and selected Legats,
identifies those Bureau fugitives who by reason of their activities

- or organizational affiliations are black extremists. For the
months in which no quarterly list is prepared, all offices and
selected Legats are advised of deletions and additions to this
list. Currently there are 64 fugitives listed, 20 of whom are
IO fugitives. This list has given greater emphasis to the
location of these fugitives, particularly among Special Agents
handling extremist matters and extremist informants and has been
effective in affording greater exposure of these fugitives among
extremist informants, Thirty-two of these fugitives have been
arrested since the list was initiated.

Bureau airtel 11/12/70 advised the field of formation
of Black Extremist Section of Single Fingerprint File in Latent
Fingerprint Section of the Identification Division, Field was
instructed to insure all black extremists who have a propensity
for violence or who would logically be considered suspects in
serious crimes in which the Bureau may have an interest were
included in the Black Extremist Section.

. By airtel dated 3/19/71, captioned "Black Extremist
Section of Single Fingerprint File, Identification Matters,
Racial Matters," all offices were instructed to give greater
emphasis to this program on a continuing basis due to increasing
participation of black extremists in crimes of violence and
continued reports from knowledgeable sources of plans of these
extremists to participate in bombings, hijackings, kidnapings
and other crimes of violence, As a result of this communication
and aggressive supervision by Extremist Intelligence Section
supervisors, the Black Extremist Section of the Single Fingerprint
File has doubled. The value of this valuable investigative
tool was demonstrated in the special investigation being handled
by this section known as Newkill. This case involves the murder
of two New York City police officers on 5/'21/71, Latents
forwarded by our New York Office for comparison against this
file resulted in the identification of two Black Panther Party
_ (BPP) members and directly led to, the solution of the machine
gunning of two New York City police officers on 5/19/71. This
information has also resulted in these individuals being
developed as suspects in the Newkill murder. Supervisors are
constantly alert to insure logical black extremists are included
in this file.
mee In view of the high percentage of black extremists who
have been reported to have weapons in their possession, the field
. by letter 3/18/71 captioned "Firearms Acts!" and by airtel
5/17/71 captioned "National Firearms Act, State Firearms
Control Assistance Act, Unlawful Possession or Receipt of Fire-
arms, Racial Matters," emphasized that aetive investigation
should be initiated concerning firearms violations stemming
from Bureau investigations over matters within our primary
jurisdiction, including racial (now extremist) matters investiga- -
tions. Field was instructed to vigorously pursue possible.
violations arising out of extremist matters investigations. Such
investigations will lead to statistical aecomplishments and to
the neutralization of black extremists, It was emphasized that
all Agents assigned to extremist matters should thoroughly review
all of the criminal statutes involving Federal gun law violations
so that they would be ina position to recognize and vigorously
pursue possible violations coming to their attention during
extremist matters investigations.

Numerous investigations have been initiated by the
field as a result of these instructions and recently four BPP
leaders in Richmond or Washington, D. C., were convicted for
Federal gun violations and one is awaiting trial. With the
emphasis being placed on violations of Federal gun laws by black
extremists, the number of convictions will increase and add to
the Bureau's statistical accomplishments as well as neutralizing
black extremists.

Investigation disclosed in Fall of 1970 that increased
campus disorders involving black students posed a definite threat
to the nation's stability and indicated the need for increase in
both quality and quantity of intelligence concerning Black Student
Unions (BSU) and similar groups which were targets for influence
and control by violence-prone BPP and other extremists. On
10/29/70 the Executive Conference approved a program to conduct
discreet preliminary inquiries, limited to established sources,
on BSU and similar groups, their leaders, and key activists to
determine if the activities of these groups and individuals
warrant further active investigation. On 11/4/70 instructions
were sent to the field to implement the program authorized by
the Executive Conference,

: ‘The results of these discreet preliminary inquiries
were analyzed and it was concluded that our responsibilities
could adequately be handled by limiting our inquiries to black
student groups on college campuses which have engaged in violent
and lawless activities or are reported by knowledgeable sources

_to be moving in the direction of violence and lawlessness, As
a result, field offices were instructed by letter dated 7/26/71
that, thereafter, discreet preliminary inquiries on black student
groups on college campuses should be limited to those groups
which have engaged in violence and/or lawless activities or are
moving in the direction of violence and lawlessness. Results of
any preliminary inquiries conducted through established sources
only in accordance with the above provisions must be reported to
the Bureau in form suitable for dissemination along with recommenda-
tions regarding whether an active investigation of the group
and/or its leaders is warranted. The field was instructed that

/30

if established sources report a black student group is moving
toward, or being influenced in the direction of, violence and
lawlessness, although no such activity has occurred, the facts
are to be furnished the Bureau with field office recommendations
regarding active investigation, No active investigation of an
organization connected with an institution of learning is
conducted without prior Bureau authority.

i BLACK PANTHER PARTY 4H

1
The Black Panther Party (BPP), a black extremist
organization, continues to be extremely active throughout the
H country, Formed during late 1966 in Oakland, California, for
the obstensible purpose of patrolling the black community to
prevent alleged police brutality, it was originally known as
the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.

It expanded rapidly throughout the United States
during 1967#68, then suffered a gradual decline during 1969.
Revitalized in December, 1969, and throughout the 1970s, it
expanded until there were approximately 48 branches of the BPP
with an estimated 1,000 hard-core members supported by many
thousands of sympathizers as of December, 1970. Another gradual
decline began in 1971; and as of June, 1971, the Party had 710
hard«core members in 39 branches representing 37 cities.

In February, 1971, the differences between Huey P.

Newton; BPP Minister of Defense, and Eldridgs Cleaver, then RPP

Minister of Information, a fugitive in Algeria, rose to the
surface; and Newton expelled eaver and his followers, About
100 BPP membérs"in New York and NéwJersey declared allegiance to
Cleaver and became known as the BPP-Cleaver Faction.

He The official goal of the BPP has always been the violent
overthrow of the United States Government and its replacement with
a Marxist-Leninist system, The BPP has openly advocated urban
guerrilla warfare, assassination of Government leaders and other
forms of violent terrorism, Since its inception, the BPP has

aimed its most vicious invectives against law enforcement and
particularly local police. "Off the pigs,' BPP jargon for "kill the
cop" is the battle cry of the organization. Newton now claims the
BPP was led astray by Cleayer, in his quest for violence when
actually the BPP is a-nonviolent, community serving organization,

In spite of Newton's peace loving front, the truth is that Newton
and his BPP are just as much anarchists as ever. On 6-30«/1 a
Washington, D. C. BPP leader and follower of Newton, stated "the
ultimate goal of the BPP is the complete destruction of the

United States Government and its replacement with Marxist-Leninist
socialism,"

i Our investigation of the BPP was instituted in 1967
and since that time has expanded as the organization itself
expanded.

By letter to all offices dated 227-70, approved by
the Director, offices having BPP investigations were instructed
-to submit intelligence reports on the BPP every six months in
compliance with instructions in the Manual of Instructions,
Previously, offices were submitting quarterly reports on the
BPP, The changes made on the basis of a recommendation by a
Racial Informants Conference of field supervisors to eliminate
some paper work in the field.

All field offices conducting an active BPP investigation
aré required to submit a monthly airtel summary of the status and
activities of the BPP within its territory. This survey was
commenced as a biweekly summary in November, 1968, and changed
to a monthly summary on the approval of the Director by letter
to all offices dated 227-70, This change is a result of a
recommendation by the Racial Informants Conference of ficld
supervisors to cut down paper work: in the field. The monthly
summary relieves the field of some paper work and at the same
time keeps the Bureau and the field up to date on BPP developments.

San Francisco as office of origin in the BPP case
continues to submit a biweekly summary and analysis of the BPP.
Because of the excellence of this summary and the need for such
an analysis by the field, San Francisco was instructed by Bureau.
airtel 1-21-70 to furnish copies of its summary to all continental
offices which is the current practice.

All field offices conducting an active BPP investigation
were instructed by airtel 6+17+70 to submit a monthly summary on
the financial activities of each BPP branch, This financial
summary includes data.on sources of income, foreign funding,
expenses, the mechanics of local finance operations, and the steps
being taken by each office to develop full financial data. This
summary enables the Bureau to keep abreast of all financial
developments regarding the BPP on a national and international basis.

/33



San Francisco was instructed 8-19-70 to submit monthly lists of
nationwide bank accounts and expenses for BPP, This survey was
devised by San Francisco; and since it is very helpful in
establishing the "big picture! it is being required monthly.

The Black Panther Party has formed a corporation known
as Stronghold Consolidated Productions, Inc, (SCPI) to control
all BPP funds and assets and to act as purchaser and/or lessee of
any property utilized by the BPP. The corporation and its
activities are under intensive investigation which has revealed
that its activities are centered in San Francisco and New York.
By airtels 1-7 and 1-19-71 to San Francisco and New York, these
offices were instructed to submit a weekly summary of all pertinent
developments concerning the corporation during the previous week
plus a monthly review of SCPI bank accounts, These summaries keep
the Bureau aware of SCPI operations and also enables us to
regularly fulfill our dissemination requirements,

It is noted that there are currently 25 field offices
conducting active investigations of the BPP, Our intensive
investigation has enabled us to identify its leaders, members
and new branches. In addition, we have developed detailed
information concerning its operations and activities including
organization plans, funding programs, extent of control by
Lectin altel and foreign support and internal factionalism,

All field offices having a BPP investigation were
_required by Bureau airtel 103-68 to submit a monthly report
containing evidentiary data required by the Department, and they
were also required by Bureau airtel 625469 to maintain records of
and to use permanent T symbol numbers to identify all concealed
sources in BPP organization reports, Both of these requirements
were based on Department requests. The Department advised that the
need on which these requests were based no longer existed, and the |
field offices were instructed by Bureau airtel 5-17-71 to
discontinue both programs,

By Bureau airtel 11-6-70, all continental offices were
instructed to submit a biweekly airtel regarding underground BPP
operations within each field office. This specific requirement
was removed by Bureau airtel 4-29-71. However, all offices were
admonished to keep the Bureau advised of any developments in this
area.

\

"The Black Panther" newspaper, official organ of the BPP,
had been printed in San Francisco since 1967 until recently when
the printing was changed to New York City, The Bureau receives.

a sufficient quantity of the paper frém New York to disseminate it
to interested agencies and all Legal Attaches. New York also
furnishes one copy of each weekly issue to all field offices. This
newspaper in the past has been the best indication of current :
Party line; therefore, this program is essential to our
intelligence gathering efforts,

Our ultimate objective is the prosecution of the BPP
as an organization or by individual members for any violations of
Federal or State laws. As in the past, we will continue to
disseminate to locai authorities any informatiou we may receive.
concerning possible local violations. A secondary objective is to
more completely develop information concerning the activities and
objectives of the BPP for intelligence purposes.

In July, 1969, the Attorney General established a
special task force for the specific purpose of developing a
prosecutive theory against the BPP. Attorneys of this task force,
known as the Special Interdivisional Unit, have interviewed many
of our informants in furtherance of this purpose.

It is recommended that the intensive investigation

of the BPP including all surveys and procedures outlined as
above be continued.

The Black Revolutionary Party is an all black
revolutionary, political organization which was formed in
April, 1971, at an internal meeting of the pro-Red China
Communist Party of Canada (Marxist-Leninist) (CP of C-ML).
Among 16 people present were four Americans including
well-known black extremist, Charles Knox, former Black Panther
Party leader in Des Moines, “ToWa

The BRP was formed within the CP of C-ML to
organize blacks in the United States and Canada operating
from headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. The BRP follows
the political line of communist Chinese leader MAO Tse-tung
and publishes a newspaper which serves as its vehicle for
disseminating its revolutionary dogma known as the "Black
Revolutionary," the first issue of which appeared in May, 1971.

The BRP intends to maintain its existence secret
until firmly established which is estimated at taking from
one and one-half to two years. [It intends to draw recruits
from both sides of the current Black Panther Party factionalism
and its proposed revolutionary program will reportedly he
based on the issue of racial suppression. This is to be
accomplished by the formation of armed self-defense units to
"fight against the barbarous rule of the monopoly, capitalist

‘eclass." +

CONGRESS OF AFRICAN PEOPLES (CAP)
157-16554

CAP was formed as an international black separatist
organization as the result of the convening of the fourth
annual gathering of black power advocates in the United States
and Atlanta, Georgia, during September, 1970. The organization,
which is heavily infiltrated at the leadership level by black
extremists, advocates the unity of blacks and the establishment
of a black nation via the revolutionary ideology of Pan~
Africanism as espoused by CAP supporter and well-known black

oy

CAP is now active in 15 cities across the Nation and
is vigorously pursuing its objectives in this country as well
as establishing rapport and lines of communication with black
groups and individuals abroad, Recent information indicates
two United States CAP representatives plan a trip in the future
to Tanzania for the purpose of establishing a CAP organization
an that ccuntry.

CAPts domestic extremist element, headed by black
revolutionaries Hayward Henry and LeRoi Jones, eall for the
extensive use of eeraet ion and violence, if necessary, by
blacks in order to create Independent Black Institutions as
are necessary to accomplish CAP's revolutionary objectives by
mass action programs utilizing “direction, dedication, and
discipline."

CAP held a Western Regional Conference in San Diego,
California, during June, 1971, during which it was recommended
a national committee be established to consider the possibility
of establishing a black paramilitary organization which would
furnish support in the form of a united front action with ail
"liberation struggles" in the United States and internationally.

CAP is currently engaged in efforts at forming an
all-black political party in the United States to nominate and
elect black officials at local, state, and national levels
who, it is felt, will support CAP's plans at establishing a
separate black nation. The organization has planned an
Eastern Regional Conference in Newark, New Jersey, for
September, 1971, and has tentatively scheduled another inter-
national meeting in early 1972.

BLACK WORKERS CONGRESS
Bufile 157-21532 ‘

\

The International Black Workers Congress (IBWC),
which is in its formative stages, is dominated by James
Forman, an official in the black revolutionary Studéat

ational Coordinating Committee. The IBWC makes its
headquarters in Detroit, Michigan, at the same locale as
that of League of Revolutionary Black Workers, a black
extremist labor union in that city.

IBWC is involved in the organizing of black
workers and students to further the revolutionary struggle
in the United States and other parts of the’ world as well
as for the purpose of building unity among all third world
peoples, IBWC's stated objective in organizing black
workers is to bring about a national work stoppage, thus
severely damaging the United States economy. Jam: nes Forman,
has repeatedly stressed the necessity for blade te” be
organized to change the capitalistic system to that of a
Marxist-Leninist society through seizure of State power.

The IBWC held a regional meeting in Gary, Indiana,
in June, 1971, at which discussions centered around organizing
black workers into a Marxist-Leninist society and preparations
for a drive to organize blacks employed in the steel industry

_ and in the "U. S, Post Office," It was indicated that IBWC
would receive assistance from the pro-Chinese Communist Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) in the form of advice concerning organizing
activities. :

An IBWwc conference tentatively scheduled to be held
in Detroit on August 21 - 22, 1971, has apparently been
canceled. Indications are that the conference site has been
shifted to Chicage, Illinois, where the eerie tea will be
scheduled within two weeks,

It is particularly significant ‘to note IBWC leader

James Forman, together with other United States black extremists,

including affiliates of the League of Revolutionary Black

JUNTA OF MILITANT ORGANIZATIONS
BUFILE 157-9903 \ 4-H

The Junta of Militant Organizations (JOMO) is a
black extremist organization with headquarters in
St. Petersburg, Florida. This group continues to be the
leading organization of all black militant groups in the
State of Florida. It was founded in St. Petersburg during
May, 1968, with 85 ghetto youths as a nucleus who believed
liberation of black people will not come about through
‘normal channels.'' The organization has affiliated groups
in Eouisville, Kentucky, and other cities in Florida. They
have attempted to organize on a national basis but have
experienced little success except with the establishment of
a chapter in Boston, Massachusetts.

The founder and leader of this organization is
Joseph Waller, Ji... an articulate Negro who holds the position
of "Chairman" and states that he intends to have dl black
militant groups in Florida designated as affiliates of JOMO.

The organization's voice and propaganda organ is

_ “The Burning Spear'' which is published on a monthly basis, -
This publication has urged blacks to buy arms and to be
prepared to fight white America. In this connection, JOMO
members have participated in racial disturbances, fire bombings,
and have been involved in attacks on police through the use of

_ violence. Members reportedly blew up a radio station in Tampa,
Florida, and participated in a plot to break out two black
"political prisoners" from a Florida prison. Members have
also been arrested for the commission of murders and robberies.

The organization has accumulated a large cache of
weapons, and its members are taught guerrilla warfare and
‘receive firearms training.

NATION OF ISLAM
Bufile 25-330971

i

The Nation of Islam (NOI} is an independent semi-
religious group consisting of an adult, hard-core, all black
membership of 6,000 members. Muhammad's Temple Number 2 of the
Holy Temples of Islam, Chicago, Illinois, is the national head-
quarters of this organization consisting of 108 groups in the
U.S. and one in Bermuda. In seven U.S, cities it operates

- University of Islam schools for 200 to 600 children at each
school, Local groups convene weekly, and once each year a
national convention is held in Chicago which is attended by
5,000 to 6,000 individuals.

The NOI remains under leadership of Elijah Muhammed
who is the self-proclaimed Messenger of Allah and "Supreme Ruler
of the Universe."" Leaders continue to stress creation of a
separate black nation; complete segregation of the races; hatred
of the white man; and development of a black economic community.
The group opposes the war in Vietnam, teaches members to evade
the draft, and strongly supports the Arabs in their conflict
with Israel in the Middle East.

re for years the leaders of the NOI have taught
members to refrain from carrying weapons and engaging in acts
of violence and open attacks on the white man, as recently as
July, 1971, the NOI Mosque, Tyler, Texas, planned the execution
of radio disc jockey and his associate for having previously
killed a fellow NOI member. Subsequently, seven members of
this mosque were involved in killing one of these men. Local
police recovered three pistols and a rifle from among members
of this group. The highly inflammatory antiwhite ideology
espoused by the NOI continues to make this group a highly volatile
extremist organization.

The organization is reaching new heights in accumulating

wealth, Three-fourths of a million dollars monthly flows in
and out of bank accounts at a national level. Corporations

have been formed to operate food processing! plants, acquire

fleet of jet airplanes.

This group continues the propagation of its beliefs
through distributing 400,000 copies weekly of its newspaper,
"Muhammad Speaks," and radio broadcasts throughout the country.

We have conducted a continuous security and/or
extremist type investigation of this group since 1953 in
‘accordance with Department directives. Each group is reported
on semiannually, and the leaders, functionaries, and those
involved in violence or extremist activities are subject to
active investigation. The Department by letter dated 7/28/66

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA
Bufile 157-9079

; The Republic of New Africa (RNA) was formed in Detroit,
Michigan, in March, 1968, by followers of Malcolm X, assassinated
black extremist. It has chapters in nine U.S. cities and a
current hard-core membership of approximately 116 individuals,

RNA was primarily formed by Milton and Richard Henry,
long-time extremists in the Detroit area. ‘When first formed,
RNA named as its President-in-exile Robert Franklin Williams
violence-prone black extremist then living in China. Williams,
who has since returned to the U.S., has resigned his position
as head of the RNA due to his own legal problems and dissension

existing within the organization.

RNA was established to create a black nation within
the U.S, demanding from the U.S. Government the States of Alabama,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, in addition
to individual reparations of $10,000 per black citizen as payment
for 400 years of ancestral slave labor.

: RNA's organizational structure is revolutionary in
character and its leaders have proposed efforts be made for inter-
national recognition and financial assistance from Cuba, Red China
and the black nations of the world. RNA, in September, 1970, made
a formal agreement of mutual revolutionary and financial support
with the leader of the Black Power Movement in Surinam,

RNA established a black army known.as the Black Legion
whose function was to protect the persons and property and to
attack the enemies (police) of that nation. Training programs
were instituted and uniforms complete with leopard skin epaulets
were designed as the official dress for the Black Legionaires,

RNA maintains its national headquarters in Detroit,
Michigan, despite the fact that since early 1970, two factions
have arisen within the organization. One faction, led by Richard
Henry, is attempting to establish a national headquarters in
New Orleans, Louisiana, This faction is the most active and
militant of the two groups and has called for intensification of
RNA activities throughout the U.S. The other group, under the

L

leadership of Milton Henry in Detroit, has been relatively
inactive for some time, The Milton Henry Faction, however, has
scheduled a -national RNA convention to be held in-Dayton, Ohio,
September 4 through 6, 1971, which activity could herald renewed
revolutionary activity by this group.

The Richard Henry Faction has been extremely active
in the past several months in attempting to obtain land and
establish a black nation in Hinds County, Mississippi. During
July, 1971, this faction held a "peoples court" to hear RNA's
case against a black farmer and owner of the land claimed by
RNA which was consecrated as the group's capitol in March 3, 1971.
The black farmer has reneged on a former offer to sell his land
to RNA. The RNA group found the farmer guilty and threatens to
seize the land by force, if necessary.

The RNA's propensity for violent action is demonstrated
by the fact-that on August 18, 1971, local police officers in
Jackson, Mississippi, accompanied by Bureau Agents raided an
RNA site seeking four subjects for whom warrants were outstanding,
one of whom was wanted for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution
(UFAP) for murder in Detroit. A shoot-out occurred during which
two police officers and a Bureau Agent were wounded. One police
officer subsequently died of a head wound, Eleven RNA members,
-including Richard Henry , have been arrested by local authorities
and the UFAP ‘subject i TS still being sought, A subsequent search
of the raided RNA headquarters determined it was a virtual
arsenal of weapons of all types including homemade bombs and
Molotov cocktails, The front door of this building had been
booby-trapped and it had an escape tunnel leading from its rear
which was accessible via a trap door in the building's interior
anda trench-bunker similar to that utilized by the Viet Cong
in the war in South Vietnam.

L STUDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE , (SNCC)
: 100-439190 \
}

SNCC was originally organized in Atlanta, Georgia,
in 1960 under the name Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, Prior to the election of Stokely. Carmichael as
its Chairman in May, 1966, the organization operated as a
nonmembership civil rights organization with both white and
black participation, _Carmichael, on assuming the Chairmanship
of SNCC, immediately eTininated all whites from participation
and changed the organization from a civil rights-oriented

ig group to one whose aims were those of antiwhite revolutionary
action and the overthrow of the United States Government, a
position which the organization maintains today,

H, Rap Brown, Bureau fugitive and well-known black
extremist Who served aS National Chairman for a time following
Carmichael’s vacating of that position in 1967, again assumed
the National Chairmanship of SNCC in the Summer of 1969, At
that time, it was announced SNCC was eliminating the word

.° "nonviolent" from its title. The organization's headquarters

were also moved from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City.

Under Brown’s direction, SNCC moved to restructure
and revitalize itself in an attempt to regain its prominence
as a black extremist organization. The national leadership
issued directives on the reorganization of the national
office in New York City, as well as the local organizations
and the formation of councils to include a Revolutionary

- Economic Council, an-: Armed Guerrilla Tactics Council, a
Research Council, and others which make up a body within SNCC
known as the Revolutionary Political Council,

As a result of H. Rap Brown's flight in May, 1970,
to avoid prosecution in Howar ounty, Maryland, on local
eharges of inciting to riot and arson, SNCC is presently
under the titular leadership of William Edward Hunt. Hunt
also serves as head of the organization's Revolutionary
Political Council. Francés Beal is the National Political
Education Officer, Hunt and Beal are the only two national
officers of SNCC,

In July, 1971, a reorganizational meeting was held
in Atlanta, Georgia. SNCC cadres gathered from several
states and were directed by Hunt, to study, understand, and
then practice principles set forth in "Contradictions" by
Mao Tse-tung and "Dialectical and Historical Materialism"
by Joseph Stalin. SNCC members in San Antonio, Texas, are

This intensification was initiated in August,

subsection of the Communist Party report, but the volume
and importance of this information made it necessary to
follow this communist influence in a separate investigation.

‘The overall objective in this and related
investigations is to protect the internal security of
the United States by submitting information relating to
possible Federal violations to the Attorney General for
prosecution,. We also have the responsibility to develop
intelligence information and disseminate to interested

The year 1970 saw continued influence by
communists and other subversives in extremist groups.
In fact, the communist attempts to influence the black
extremist Black Panther Party were so insistent that the
Panthers have become wary of the motives of the Communist
Party. This has not diminished in any way the Communist
Party's efforts to influence and support the Black Panther
Party, the communist tactic being to support the Panthers
whether they want it or not.

There are those in the Communist Party who oppose
or are extremely reluctant to support the Black Panther
Party especially those in the Black Panther Party who call
for "revolutionary suicide." Charlene Mitchell, Secretary
of the Black Liberation of the Communist Party, is
reportedly attempting to split the Communist Party and form
a Black Panther Communist Party which believes in violent
and dramatic action, Her group is reportedly waiting for
Angela Davis, admitted Communist Party member currently
incarcerated in California awaiting trial in connection
with the kidnapping and murder of a judge in California
during an attempted escape by prisoners from the courtroom,
to be released at which time Davis will become public
leader of the new party, The Communist Party is girding
itself to oppose the split.

In June, 1971, a group led by James Rufus Forman,
Coordinator. of. International Affairs for i
Student National Coordinating Committee (SNCC), ‘visited
Hanoi ostensibly to establish rapport between the

- North Vietnamese and black people in the United States,

The group's trip was also to include Algiers, Guinea, and
Tanzania to reestablish old contacts for SNCC and initiate
new ones.

"SNCC Monthly," the publication of SNCC, in its

: March, 1971, issue, contained an article about "Third

World People," united by "common historical oppression,"
People in Cuba, Vietnam, Guinea, and the Palestinian
guerrillas were mentioned as having cut off the tentacles
of "the monster," imperialism, Another article in the same
issue was printed to politicize the readers on the Arab
Israeli conflict and clarify the similarity between the
Arab position and that of other "people of color" throughout
the world,

KEY BLACK EXTREMIST PROGRAM 4-H

Key Black Extremist (KBE) Program initiated 12/23/70
with Director's approval to intensify investigative coverage
of selected black extremists throughout United States who are
extremely active and most vocal in their calls for terrorism
and violence, Ninety individuals are currently on the KBE
list, including such persons as Stokely Carmichael, Huey..Newton.
and David Hilliard.

Objective of program is to develop complete and
detailed information on the day-to-day activities and future
plans of KBE individuals, Investigative summary report is
required followed by investigative report every 90 days.

All KBE individuals are included in Priority I of
Security Index, Each is included in the Black Nationalist
Photograph Album. Ail aspects of their finances are determined,
Their handwriting specimens are placed in the National Security
File in the Laboratory Division, Their fingerprints are
included in the Black Extremist Section of the Single Fingerprint
File in the Identification Division, Particular attention is
paid to their travel. Possible criminal violations are
vigorously pursued, Emphasis is placed on obtaining record of
their inflammatory statements. High level of informant coverage
on each individual is required. :

Supervision of KBE investigations is handled on the
individual desks and additions to and deletions from KBE List
must be approved by Bureau. Inasmuch as KBE individuals are of
the type whose investigation would ordinarily require close
supervision by Bureau supervisors, the administration and
supervision of this program entails only a minimum amount of
time above that which would ordinarily be expended on the
supervision of the cases of these persons,

Continuation of this program will be justified in
December, 1971.

EXTREMIST INFORMANTS 4-H

The prime purpose of development and utilization
of extremist informants and sources is to provide intelligence
and evidenciary information concerning black and white
extremist organizations and individuals. These sources are
| also called upon to furnish information concerning situations
affecting civil unrest in all parts of the country.

Supervision of extremist informants at the Seat of

i Government includes review and approval of new informants

| and confidential sources, review of progress of informants,
review of payments being made to informants, analysis of
informant coverage in each field office, analysis of nation-
wide informant coverage of the various extremist organizations,
coordination of informant coverage of specific functions such
as Black Panther Party (BPP) and other extremist groups
conventions, supervision of operations for the development of
top~echelon BPP informants, and other special projects such as
development of information concerning black extremist under-
ground escape routes and coordinating utilization of informants
abroad with other agencies, All procedures are constantly
‘evaluated. in an effort to increase the efficiency of our
operation and to provide the field with the necessary supervision
with a minimum of paper work,

As of 7/31/71 we are operating a ‘total of 7,477
extremist informants compared with a total of 14184 Se thS
time of the last Inspection, This is an increase of _293
informants, Concerning the above informants, 583 informants
report on black extremist organizations and 353 informants
report on white extremist organizations such as the Klan. We
are operating 6,541. ghetto informants who provide general
information within the black ghetto areas of our cities as
compared to 6,224 ghetto informants at the time of the last
“Inspection which represents an increase of 317 ghetto informants. °

In line with the fluctuating membership in the
various black extremist organizations, we have constantly
adjusted our informant coverage. This can be seen very
clearly with the most violent of the black extremist groups,
the Black Panther Party, At the time of the last Inspection
BPP membership was 1,000, and we afforded coverage of these
‘1,000 members with 173 informants which represents 17,3 percent
of the membership. The present membership is 710, and we have
156 informants reporting on these individuals which represents
21./ percent of the membership. This is a net increase of
informant coverage to total membership of 4.4 since the last
Inspection, This also indicates our aims and purposes of
penetrating these organizations with the most qualified
informants and keeping within the policy of operating the
informant program in a very efficient manner.

At the time of the last Inspection we were operating
316, informants furnishing information concerning white extremist
organizations, and as of 7/31/71 we are operating 353 informants.
This is in keeping with the current membership of the Klan and
white hate organizations.

By memorandum dated 2/19/71 from G. C. Moore to
Mr. C. D..Brennan captioned "Penetration of Black Extremist

" Groups in Canada, Racial Matters'' it was recommended and

approved that this Bureau attempt to penetrate the Hack extremist
activities in Canada due to the close working relationship

being developed between the extremists in that country and the
United States. We made available to the Royal, Canadian Mounted
Police(RCMP) a top source of the Baltimore Division, — By
letter dated 7/20/71 “from rom Legat, 0 Ot set out that |
Ehe RCMP advised they. have bi i :

ROP indicated that Halifax, Nova Scotia, is fast
becoming a focal point of black extremist activity ; in in Canada.

By memorandum dated 7/29/71 it was recommended
and approved that we solicit of the field the identities of
informants who may be able to travel to Ganada. This
project is presently being followed very closely.

By memorandum dated 5/5/70 from G. C. Moore to
Mr. W. C. Sullivan captioned "Racial Informant Development,
Black Panther Party (BPP), Racial Matters'' it was recommended
and approved that two Special Agents of the San Francisco
Division be assigned to work exclusively on developing a top-
level informant in the BPP, By Letter dated 6/17/7i ins
—
San Francisco was instructed that captioned program is being
discontinued, Review of this program showed that all avenues
leading to the possible development of high-level BPP informants
have been explored and the groundwork laid for the development
of top»echelon leaders who might defect. Therefore, it was
- believed that it was no longer necessary to have two
Special Agents assigned exclusively to this program, This
will bring about a savings in manpower; however, San Francisco
is under instructions to continue aggressive efforts to
penetrate the, top.echelon.of. the BPP, This is being closely
followed at the Seat of Government.

GHETTO INFORMANTS

The ghetto informant program was instituted 10/11/67
to fulfill an urgent need to develop a network of "listening
posts’ in the ghetto areas of our cities, A ghetto informant
‘is an individual living or working in the ghetto aréa who is
available to furnish information concerning conditions which
may create civil unrest, :

)S4

HW 55151 Docld:32989638 Page 166



- a
||

bot

Since 1967 this program has been significantly
modified in that this vast network of informants have been
changed from listening posts to individuals who are actively
seeking extremist information as well as information concerning
violations of Federal and local statutes,

We have noted numerous incidents where ghetto
informants are being converted by the field to regular
extremist informants in that they have been graduated into
positions where they can report on a regular basis concerning
the activities of individual extremists and/or extremist
organizations, As a valuable by-product we are also achieving
eriminal statistics through contacts with our ghetto informants.
This program was justified by memorandum dated 7/4/71 from
G. C. Moore to Mr. C. D. Brennan captioned "Ghetto Informant
Program, Racial Matters" and is scheduled to be rejustified
_in July, 1972.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM - BLACK EXTREMISTS
Bufile 100~448006

Counterintelligence action regarding black extremists
was initiated 8/25/67 and was last justified 5/14/70. This
program was a supplement to our black extremist investigative
activities and involved a variety of sensitive intelligence
techniques which were afforded close supervision at the Seat
of Government. No action could be instituted under this
program without prior Bureau authorization,

To afford additional security to our sensitive
techniques and operations, all counterintelligence programs,
including this program, were discontinued and the field was
so advised by airtel 4/28/71.

Although this program was discontinued, the field
was advised if exceptional instances arose wherein it was
considered counterintelligence action is warranted, that
recommendations should be submitted to the Bureau under the
specific case caption involved. These recommendations will
then be considered on an individual basis, The field was
also reminded that prior Bureau authority is required before
initiating any activity of a counterintelligence nature,

NAME CHECKS OF ALIENS HOLDING DIPLOMATIC AND
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION VISAS

This program was initiated in January, 1952, as a means of
> keeping the Attorney General advised of information of a subversive
nature relating to the diplomats and officials of foreign countries entering
the United States in official capacities. These data are required by the
Attorney General to assist in discharging his responsibilities under the
Immigration and Nationality Act for exclusion and/or deportation of
foreign officials where their activity requires such action.

: The basis for this program is found in the procedure by .
Immigration and Naturalization Service in its submission of a form
advising of the arrival of the alien officials in this country, which form is
sent to member agencies of the intelligence community. The separate
agencies perform name checks on the data in these forms with the results
being channelized to the FBI, We correlate this information with data
-irom our files and furnish saime io the Attorney General. In those
instances where additional investigation appears warranted, we obtain
-clearance from Department of State and issue appropriate instructions

to the field for active investigation. ee
Since the program was initiated, 794, “570 Tien and
Naturalization Service forms have been processed and we have
. undertaken'474 investigations based on results thereof.

The program continues to supplement our overall coverage in
the intelligence field with the majority of the work being handled by
. trained clerical personnel within the Nationalities Intelligence Section
- and some isolated instances of involved investigations being handled by
substantive desk supervisors within the Division. Based on the limited
_- number of active investigations opened since the inception of this program,
- the cost of the program, consists mainly of name check expenditures. The
program continues to serve a necessary purpose in our overall intelligence
coverage, serving to alert us to the presence in this country of persons
having a capability for intelligence activities or who may pose a security
tad to the United States. :

. The program is justified annually, with the last justitieation
having been made February 18, 1971.

Bocov is a code word which concerns a highly
sensitive intelligence operation of this Bureau which was in
effect from 4/24/48 ontil 9/11/72. - The purpose of this
“operation was to attempt to identify foreign subversive ~
elements entering the U. S. Although this operation is -no
longer in existence, the disclosure of the fact that it was
once carried on would undoubtedly severely impaiz the abilities

of this Bureau to fulfill its domestic obligations, not only

with regard to the internal security of the U. S., but also

in investigating criminal matters of an international nature.

Furthermore, unauthorized disclosure of details of this

operation could jeopardize the lives of individuals who
cooperated with this Bureau and who are currently residing

abroad.

SECURITY INDEX - CUBA

Background and Date of Inception

This program was instituted in November, 1960.
By that date it was obvious that Cuba, whose Government
had been taken over by Fidel Castro in January, 1959,
was a communist state posing a real and present threat
to the internal security of the United States. In 1962,
at.the time of the Cuban missile crisis, an Agent
Supervisor at the Bureau was assigned the specific
responsibility for administering this program to assure
the apprehension and special handling of the individuals
included therein in the event of a limited emergency
involving Cuba.

Scope and Desired Objectives

As of July 15, 1971, there were 409 individuals
included in the Security Index - Cuba Program, divided
into two categories:

1. Individuals placed on the
oC Security Index solely on
account of their pro-
Cuban activities (Cuban
Special Section - 93
persons).

2. Persons already on the
Security Index because of
other subversive connections
and activities who would
warrant special attention
in the event of hostilities
with Cuba (Security Index
subjects tabbed "Pro-Cuban" ~
316 individuals).

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION INSPECTION
1/18/71

VENzem) : Yb /



& Sees @
|
Program is designed to maintain an up-to-date
record of location and activities of individuals included
therein, by means of established Security Index procedures
and reporting, in order that we are in a position to move
Swiftly should the apprehension or special handling of
these persons become necessary.
i

Positive Results Achieved

Determination as to the validity of an
individual's inclusion in this program is constantly
under review. Since the program was last justified on
April 7, 1971, the number of persons on the Cuban Section
of the Index has been reduced from 95 to 93. These 93
persons are judged to be hard-core pro-Cubans, action
against whom in a Cuban emergency would be mandatory.

Of these 93, 28 are Cuban aliens. Each subject of pending
security investigations with Cuban ramifications is
considered for inclusion in the Index.

Extent and Nature of Current Supervision

\ The Agent Supervisor responsible for this

} program is required to review each investigative

‘ communication in current cases of pro-Cuban individuals
to determine whether the individual meets the criteria
for inclusion in the Index, as outlined in the Manual of
Instructions. He must make a decision as to the degree
of dangerousness of the individual under the Priority
Apprehension Program and rule on the field's recommendations
regarding these matters. He initiates procedures with
the Security Index Desk of the Domestic Intelligence
Division and Voucher Statistical Section of the
Administrative Division regarding the placing of an
individual on the Index, his removal and the assignment
or change in apprehension priority.

If the-individual involved is an alien,
correspondence with the Internal Security Division of the
Department is required to assure the preparation of a
pre-positioned arrest warrant by Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Action is also taken with the
Department to cancel the arrest warrant if the alien is
removed from the Index.

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 175 -2- Jb 2



Current Justification

7 The threat to the internal sécurity of the
United States from communist Cuba has not lessened in
recent years. A workable priority apprehension system
which receives current and continuing attention is
mandatory. This program, as presently organized and
handled, is fully justified.

Frequencies of Evaluation and Date of Last Evaluation

This program is evaluated on a semiannual
basis, The most recent review and evaluation was dated
April 7, 1971.

‘restrictions on United States citizens and the proposéd
amendment to the law concerning permanent resident aliens
will greatly increase the number of investigations under

‘this program, Many of the individuals traveling to China

-from the United States will be legitimate merchants, scholars,

‘and tourists. However, they will be subjected to possible

approaches for intelligence purposes. In addition, we will

;possibly be able to utilize legitimate travelers as walk-ins.

_ ‘Therefore, it is essential that we fully identify all those
.who enter China or contact PRC diplomatic establishments :

Chicoms as a visitor, particularly if he has relatives th

investigations since the last inspection have

greatly increased. Many of the investigations are in the

initial stages of identifying the individuals. In February,

“1971, the Chicoms established an Embassy in Ottawa, Canada.
During that month, 14 United States residents contacted the

‘Embassy. During June, 156 residents contacted the Embassy

-* in addition to contacts with the Chicom propaganda news 7
‘agency, New China News Agency. Included among these people

re ethnic Chinese, national political figures in the

‘United States, China scholars, journalists and merchants.

The increase from February through June of over 1,000 percent

indicates the acceleration of the problem facing the Bureau

in this program. During July, there was a substantial increase

encouraging visitors to the Embassy in Ottawa. Our common

ECTOR E, S. MILLER: In order that the overall foreign liaison
can be fully and currently evaluated, you

are requested to furnish your comments concerning each Legal Attache Office

presently operating (17); former Legal Attache Offices which you have proposed

to be reopened (3); and proposed new Legal Attache Offices (3).

In providing this information,. you are requested to be specific as to: (1)
productivity (including intelligence) of each existing office (provide examples) ;
(2) comment as to adequacy of personnel assigned (fully document if additions, de-
.letions or changes recommended); (3) make specific recommendations regarding
continuing or discontinuing each of existing offices.

You are also requested to state your current recommendations regarding
each former and new Legal Attache Office proposed above.

Comments of Assistant Director Brennan and Section Chief Wannall

requested.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:C, D, BRENNA! I concur with the attached
(CDB:mis 8/25/71) comprehensive analysis of

Section Chief Wannall in

regard to our Legal Attache operations abroad. The Inspector should
- particularly note Wannall's concluding observation that any future

expansion abroad will be resisted by the Department of State and

Central Intelligence Agency and unless specifically ordered by

the White House, will require approval from State and Bureau of

the Budget. As Mr. Wannall’points out, we are not in a position

to balance the value of the information expected against the costs,

and I would suggest the Inspector insure that a copy of Mr. Wannall's

overall analysis is furnished to the Administrative Division

inasmuch. as the Director on 8/23/71 approved the recommendation that

the Administrative Division should coordinate and handle all requests

for increased staffing, as well as the creation of new Legal Attache

posts. ; ‘

6 new offices opened in December, 1970, and (3) the 6
additional offices which we proposed be opened in response
to the Director's inquiry in May, 1971. With respect to

ttl : - -.- BERN - PERE

Our operations in Switzerland are most ‘delicate -
because of the fierce independence of ‘the Swiss, who would
not permit the use of "Legal Attache” as it was ’ considered
too widely identified with the FBI. As a result, our

NW 55151

“merely as'an Attache. The office has become increasingly

important in the criminal field very recentlyas a result of

“-the large scale thefts of securities in the United States

_and their transportation to and attempted sale or hypothecation
“in Switzerland. In addition, it has long been the goal to
-obtain access to information concerning bank accounts opened

in Switzerland by subjects of our investigations. Progress
has been slow but we have been able to secure limited
information and the cooperation received is the direct result

of the personal liaison of our Legal Attache.

-* ° Productivity

During fiscal 1971, the office located 7 fugitives

: and arranged 4 "informal deportations." Its pending case load
-as of 6/30/71 was 83 which is approximately average on a per

agent basis in the foreign field. Through 8/23/71 Bern had
submitted 7 HILEV items of which 5 were actually disseminated.
This is the smallest number of submissions of any Legal Attache
and the second smallest number of acceptable items.

average. He has twice furnished advance information
concerning important political developments including the
current coup and he has received commendation from the

° Recommendation
It is recommended that operations continue in
La Paz for another six months at the end of which time a close
hard look should be given to closing the office. it is
possible that a more friendiy regime in Bolivia will result in
an increase in HILEV items but it will have no bearing on his

MANAGUA
5 This is an office opened in Pre right area but
in the wrong place. There is Bureau business in Central
* America and we had long considered recommending an office
_ there prior to the President's request in 1970, We did ~
- not want to open in Managua, however, but in San Jose,
Costa Rica, where the living conditions are far superior.
We were forced to settle for Managua when the Ambassador
to Costa Rica objected to our opening there. As a result,
-we have two men living under difficult circumstances
resulting in varied domestic problems including education
of their children, and morale in our Managua Office is
probably lower than in any other foreign post. It was
expected that Central America would prove a fertile source
of HILEV items because of the constantly changing political
alignments in the various governments, This has not been
+ the case and Bulet 6/4/71 informed the Legal Attache of
our disappointment in his production. At the start of
.. dune he had only submitted 2 items, 1 of which had been
-i,used. He is showing improvement as indicated by the submission ©
. of three items in June, four in duly, and five in August,
“as of 8/23/71. The Legal Attache has been placed on probation
"as a result of administrative deficiencies discovered by
- the Inspector and it is expected that this will have a salutary
. effect not only in his administration but also in the
Ste ac of his office to the work of ene Bureau.

. During the first six months of 1971, “44 persons
wanted in the United States were located in Central America, -
‘5 “informal deportations" were arranged, and 10 stolen 7
automobiles were recovered, The Managua case load as of
6/30/71 was 65 which is far below average. A total of 14
HILEV items have been received of which 9 have been accepted.
This total is below average but his current submission rate
;: dis well above average.

Personnel

The 7 Central American countries have enough
: substantive Bureau work to justify the present complement
_ of this office, if the potential is fully exploited, We are
watching this situation closely and expect marked improvement,



-~16- 4H
Recommendation

: It is recommended that this office continue.
It is possible that a change in leadership may be necessary
. as indicated by the Inspector's findings and recommendations
- concerning this will be made as soon as it can be determined
whether or not there has been an improvement.

TEL AVIV

s This office was opened solely as a source of

HILEV material and it has proved fertile in this respect.

. There have been some unexpected fringe benefits in that an

- organized crime figure has taken refuge in Tel Aviv and

’ the Legal Attache has been able to secure the cooperation
-of the Israeli police in affording coverage to the anti-Soviet
. Jewish Defense League, which has proven so troublesome in

’ the New York City area. As the office has only been open

. Guring the current year, it is too early to assess peeuretesy:
either its potential or its achievements. 7

Productivity

Eight persons wanted in the United States have

been located in Israel and 3 "informal deportations" arranged.
- The case load as of 6/30/71 was 69, which is considerably
. below average on a per agent basis. Forty-four HILEV items

~ have been submitted of which 27 have been used with 1 pending.
- This is substantially above average, and the Director recently
- noted the Legal Attache's excellent production and he has
been recommended for commendation, : a“ 7

Personnel

It is too early to make an accurate assessment as
to future personnel needs. One agent could handle the present
case load but we do not feel that the full potential of the
area has yet been reached and any reduction:-:.* would result
in two one-man offices at the end of the Mediterranean with
accompanying problems of relief.

“lain connection ‘with any future expansion is based solely upon
“our experience during the December, 1970, expansion, together
With regulations whichhave been promulgated applicable to
United States personnel overseas. In December, 1970, we asked
_. to open an office in San Jose, Costa Rica, but ended up in
Managua, Nicaragua, a much less desirable location, because
‘ of what was termed the “objective of lower United States

“imposed by the Ambassador, with the result that we canceled
/, our request. In connection with opening in Caracas, Venezuela,
“the Ambassador there demanded that we agree to coordinate any
‘inteiligence activities wiih the Centrai iutelligeuce Ageucy

committee any increase in these ceilings must be either

(a) a result of "special studies" or at White House direction;
or (b) by a request for a ceiling increase by proposal to

“communists (Chicoms) have established themselves officially

therefore, we receive little or no data concerning the Chicoms

“from Royal CanadianM Mounted Police (RCMB), much data relating

2. Restrictions on travel of U. ‘citizens to
“Rea China have been lifted entirely, and there is presently
-under study by Department of State and the Attorney General
a recommendation that the prohibition on travel of permanent
sae een aliens to Red China also’ be lifted.

cannen : While the Chicoms have not allowed wholesale’ entry .
£ Occidentals into their country, recent events suggest
they are slowly but surely revising policy to permit more
Westerners to visit the mainland. We are aware that the
 Chicoms have openly supported revolutionaries who operate in

, the U. S., and the desirability of personal contact with such
_types as well as with others who would work for the Chicoms
+,is obvious. The new United States policy regarding travel of
‘U.S, citizens to Red China will most assuredly prompt overt
travel by individuals of Chicom persuasion as well as by

persons who could well be subjected to an intelligence recruit-
‘ment approach albeit. unwittingly. While this area may not :}
| immediately present problems of the magnitude expected in other -
areas involviug tke Chicuilis, we must realistically concider
-that U. S. citizens traveling to Red China deserve a careful
ook from an investigative standpoint, either as potential
ources, one-time interviews. for intelligence purposes, or as
individuals who may have been recruited std the Chicoms during
their isit a Red China. 5

With, regard to the Jossibility that restrictions on ©
travel of resident aliens to Red China will be lifted soon,
there are in the United States many thousands of Chinese aliens
“having permanent resident status, most of whom have family
embers or close relatives residing on the mainland. If travel
estrictions on these individuals are lifted, we are faced with
an‘even greater danger of having Chicom-recruited individuals
-returning here. On its face, such a situation would pose an
enormous FTE SiNeEcaNrenVAie problem iia the Bureau,

Rogers. announced U. S. policy as regards admission of
“Communist China to the United Nations (UN). Simply stated,
Administration policy is to not oppese UN membership for the
Chicoms while not agreeing to-the ouster of Nationalist China
(Taiwan) from the UN, There has been much talk of a "two China
policy," but this is incidental to the real problem we face.
With the removal of U. S. opposition, it is likély.:. Red China

will appear in New York City between October, 1971, and :
September, 1972. When this almost certain development takes

‘place, we will _be faced with Stave: internal Aieceeene Cee eae tee
problems.

“In appraising the above situation and. toting that “the
_ Chicoms, should they gain UN membership, would be entitled to
:the largest delegation and largest percentage of UN Secretariat
employees of any member nation, we would clearly require a sub-
stantial increase in the number of Agents handling Chinese work
in the New York Office. Such an increase would include assign-
ments to that office of as many Chinese-speaking Special Agent
- personnel as may be available and examination of the need to
- train additional Agents in the Chinese language. Dependent on
the size of a Chicom UN delegation, it might be necessary to .
_°. @stablish-a Chinese Section in New York Office. Should a sub-
_ stantial-increase in case load in the Chicom field come about as
a result of ‘Chicom entry into the UN, it would also suggest an_
. increase in the number of Supervisors in this field at, the,
Seat of Government, .

: with regard to the investigative aspect of, Ghicom. 7
entry into the UN, it is felt that the Chicoms, on arrival,’ will
: > p¥oceed cautiously at the outset in any program of covert or
“ evert intelligence activity. . That intelligence efforts will be
undertaken, there is no-doubt inasmuch as information in our
. files and sound logic demand the conclusion that the Chicoms will
_ rely on a wariety of methods by which to gather information to
assist in the planning and execution of political moves as well
‘as to combat or neutralize technical and scientific progress
and military moves made by this and other countries, The Chicoms,
with a base at the UN, might limit early.intelligence efforts
‘to political matters until they have their feet on the ground.
Knowledge of their collection of such intelligence, however,
could be of as much benefit to this country as would knowledge of
hicoms efforts to collect Aabsarnaed types of intelligence..

ADDENDUM Sel

INSPECTOR E. S. You have advised that items one through
(ESM:wmj 8/26/71 nine in this write -up will be fully im-

plemented by separate memorandum in
each case consistent with the availability of manpower.

It would appear that present developments indicate that
further delay in implementation of some of these programs may seriously
retard our response to important investigative responsibilities.

You are requested to advise specifically when such
programs will be implemented and what manpower requirements are
necessary to do so.

Comments of Assistant Director Brennan and Section Chief

Wannall requested. kh

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D, BRENNAN? I believe the five areas

(CDB:m1s 9/1/71) outlined by W. R. Wannall
constitute a valid base from

which to expand our coverage of anticipated Chicom intelligence
and subversion which will be directed against this country when
diplomatic relations are established and/or United Nations membership
is established for the Chicoms, It is desirable to initiate these
programs as soon as possible, prior to being faced with the Chicom

- activity. *

My position concerning available manpower to accomplish
this is covered under the write-up captioned "Adequacy of
Personnel," 6E. AS you are aware, the proposed work load adjust—
ments contained in my memorandum dated 7/29/71 will make available
some additional personnel, and further adjustments may well be
made possible by close examination of case count figures under
the new tightened procedures for counting pending cases, A mid-
month case count was prepared for the Inspection Staff as of
8/20/71, and an end of the month case count is currently being
prepared.

If these figures confirm a lower case load for
Nationalities Intelligence (8/20/71 figure is 275 case load
average and well below other Sections), I believe at least one

So. Ge;

If the Inspector feels two men should be made immediately

i I have conferred with the Section Chiefs of the afore-

of'each of the cases which the Department has indicated it intends
to'proceed against to determine what additional investigation is
required to develop the evidence necessary to present to the
SACB. Administrative procedures for handling these cases have
been worked out and since the caseS are supervised in three
different Sections, a Division Coordinator, who has had previous
experience in preparing cases for presentation to the SACB, has
been designated to insure that the cases are handled in a
uniform manner in each of the three Sections.

So far, the Department has indicated that it intends
to initiate proceedings against the Black Panther Party, Progressive
Labor Party, Young Socialist Alliance and Ku Klux Klan; however,
we have not as yet had any specific requirements levied upon
us by the Department in these cases. Based on past experience,
it‘can be anticipated the services of one supervisor, full time,
will be required to prepare each of these cases for presentation
to the SACB.

The language of Executive Order 11605 is very

most of the organizations we have under investigation although
the Department has not indicated at this time that they will

ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS



DIVIDING DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 5-A-la
INTO TWO DIVISIONS

| Ut eoron E.S. MILLER: ’ Assistant to the Director Sullivan has

suggested that Domestic Intelligence
Division (DID) be divided into two separate divisions. In order that this matter
can be analyzed during this inspection you are requested to furnish:

1. Complete table of organization for each of two new Divisions as you would
organize them if suggestion were adopted. Do not use names of supervisors,
Section Chiefs, Front Office administrators. Use only position designations,
| Section and Unit designations and number of Agents and clerks designated for
each Unit and Section.

! 2, In the event you feel work now being handled by another Division should
be realigned in the event above suggestion adopted, so indicate under appropriate
new division.

3. Following each of the two tables of organization for the above new
i divisions, set out Section by Section and where appropriate, Unit by Unit,
your reasoning for placement in division. In this regard, it will be necessary
.to take into account and balance both volume of work and nature of work being
handled.

4, Indicate advantages in adoption of above suggestion.

5. Set out disadvantages you feel apparent in dividing DID. Also indicate
how such can be overcome and resolved.

6. Since adoption of above would involve possible realignment of space in
some instances, you are requested to advise what new space would be necessary
and what other movement of personnel and equipment would be involved.

2. It will be noted that supervision of antiriot and
bombing cases currently in General Investigative Division
has been included in table of organization of proposed
Domestic Intelligence Division and specifically assigned
to the Extremist Intelligence Section, Four Agents and
: two clerks are now assigned to this Unit in the General
i Investigative Division and should, of course, be transferred
| “ to the new Division.

‘This is a most logical move and will afford tighter
and more effective supervision of antiriot and bombing vio-
lations in view of fact that extremists and terrorists mostly
involved are being actively investigated by Domestic Intelli-
gence Division (DID). Accordingly, in eddition to avoiding-.
duplicative supervisory action, it follows that DID is better
prepared to handle these criminal investigations and final
prosecutive actions.

3, The line of reasoning utilized in the breakdowns
as set forth above in the tables of organization was to separate
- the work into two mtegories as nearly as possible - domestic
and foreign.

The proposed Domestic Intelligence Division is
composed of New Left, Extremist Intelligence and Internal
Security Sections. All work of these Sections is domestic
oriented consisting of domestic subversive and extremist
organizations such as Communist Party, Socialist Workers
Party, black extremists, New Left and anti-war groups as
well as individuals affiliated therewith. sense!

On the other hand, the proposed Counterespionage ~
Foreign Intelligence Division is composed of the Espionage
and Nationalities Intelligence Sections which supervise
investigations which for the most part have definite foreign
ramifications, The work of these Sections is foreign oriented
consisting of such investigations as Soviet and satellite
establishments and individuals as well as other foreign
nationality groups and nationals, including Chinese communists.
The Nationalities Intelligence Section will continue to super-
vise Legal Attaches and domestic Liaison through ‘the Special

NW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 234 220 ; 7



Coordination Unit. Other miscellaneous investigative matters
involving extremist groups with foreign nationality ties such
as Mexican-Americans, Spanish-Americans, and Puerto Ricans
will continue to be assigned to the Nationalities Intelligence
Section.

The Research Section has been placed in the Counter-
espionage ~ Foreign Intelligence Division in order to balance
the workload as well as to provide for expansion for research-
type work in espionage and foreign intelligence areas or for
the manpower therein to be used as the Assistant Director sees
most advantageous to carry out his responsibilities. It is
recognized that this will cut DID short but it is felt DID.
‘ will be able to handle any needed research at a Section level’,

“The New Left and Civil Disorder Reporting Units,
currently in the Research Section, will be placed in Internal
Security Section as data pertains solely to domestic groups.
Likewise, administration of Security Index (SI) will be shifted
fxom Research Section te the Internal Security Section as-most
of the cases on the SI are supervised in the DID.

In realigning work, we have provided for transfer
of three Agents from Sections within the proposed Domestic
Intelligence Division to the Nationalities Intelligence
Section of other new Division. This has been accomplished

- by absorbing Klan and White Hate cases (2 men) into Extremist
Intelligence Section and releasing one Agent from the current
four-man Security Informant Unit of the Internal Security —
Section. :

The proposed reorganization will result in the
following Agent - clerical count:

Domestic Intelligence Division

73 Agents

105 clerks
This includes four Agents and two
clerks to be transferred from General
Investigative Division to handle
antiriot and bombing matters,

o2/

NW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 235



Counterespionage - Foreign Intelligence Division
i
52 Agents i |
96 clerks
This includes raising the overall Agent
complement of current Division personnel
by one to provide for a new Assistant
Director.

4, The advantage of the suggestion to form two

separate Divisions out of the current Division is that it
would provide for smaller Divisions thus allowing for tighter
and more effective supervision.

5. The disadvantages in dividing the current Division

far outweigh the advantages as can be seen from the following
observations:

(a) The nature of the work of DID does not

- readily lend itself to division. The interrelationship
of foreign influence in domestic subversion cases

is well established and requires close coordination
within the Division. If split, something would

be lost in the process, as is now the case with
antiriot and explosives and incendiary devices

eases, predominantly involving extremists who

are DID subjects being handled by General
Investigative Division, Our goal should be to
obtain maximum utilization of the knowledge and
expertise of supervisory personnel, and division

of DID would obviously result in diffusion of related
talents and a less efficient use of available
manpower.

(b) ‘Budgetary consideratbns and administrative
efficiency would be affected by imposing an additional
Divisional superstructure (mail room, mail delivery _
elerks, Division Head and staff, with their equipment,
odd-hour duty Agents, supply clerks, and steno pool, etc.)
to handle the work presently being handled efficiently
by existing DID, The creation of an additional high-
level job (Division Head and staff) would be contrary
to the President's economic freeze. Apparently the

222



|
in

‘suggestion of Assistant to the Director W. C.:Sullivan to

divide the Division referred to by the Inspector is that

set forth in memorandum from Mr. Sullivan to Mr, Tolson
dated June 28, 1971. On that memorandum the Director stated,
"I do not approve. We do not have any provision for another
Assistant Director and all hearings before Budget Bureau and
Congress have been concluded for Fiscal Year 1972." In light
of the current national economic picture, the Director's
comment is even more meaningful today.

These disadvantages, with the exception of the
economy factor, can be overcome to a large extent by utilizing
current space in 9th and D Street building with a minimum of
carpentry work involved. The Executive office space can
easily be arranged to handle another Assistant Director and
staff. The Mail Room and Steno Pool would require alterations
involving additions of partitions. Extra-duty shifts involving
4 p.m. to Midnight and Midnight to 8 a.m. can be arranged to
service both Divisions from cperaticnal and security stand-
points. On the other hand, the biggest disadvantage is that
the split definitely will serve to lessen coordination of
cases having foreign ramifications as so many of our domestic
extremist cases do. This disadvantage likewise can be overcome
to a large extent if we make up our minds to be extra careful
to make certain that coordination between the new Division

- is such that Bureau is not embarrassed, This could cause

a certain slow down in the handling of mail and result in
duplicative handling in some instances.

6. It is felt current space is adequate to house the
two Divisions with slight alterations as previously set out.
Equipment for a new Assistant Director should not present any
significant problem.

ANTI-RIOT LAWS AND BOMBING MATTERS 5-A-1Lb
fi 7 . {
i deector E. S. MILLER: In discussions, you have advised that
: in your opinion there appears a

great deal of logic in realigning supervision of above cases from General
Investigative Division to Domestic Intelligence Division.

You are requested to advise in greater detail documentation of
your reasoning and your recommendations in this regard.

For your information, on receipt of your response to this
write-up it will be furnished to General Investigative Division for their
observations and recommendations.

. Comments of Assistant Director Brennan requested.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D, BRENNAN By memorandum 8/30/68 from

‘ Mr. Felt to Mr. Tolson,
Inspection Division did an in-depth survey with respect to similar
problem relative to transfer of subStantive violations of
Antiriot Laws and bombing cases involving subversive matters from
GID to DID.. Survey ascertained proposed transfer involved two
categories supervised by GID which were so interrelated with
gathering of intelligence in racial and security field that
‘overlapping supervisory responsibilities constantly occurred.
Accordingly, Inspection Division recommended transfer of these
cases to DID to avoid duplication of supervisory review and to
promote efficiency. Transfer not effected as Director stated he
was opposed to transfer of these duties. A copy of Mr. Felt's
8/30/68 memorandum is attached together with a cover memorandum
from Mr. Felt dated 9/4/68,
Developments since 9/4/68 dictate that we take another
good look at this problem.

Activities of extremists and terrorists have
. definitely escalated to the point that the overall situation
is a matter of increasing concern to the public and the

administration. Since terrorist activities such \, bombings,
riots and the like are in violation of statutes under Bureau's

investigative responsibility it behooves us to make certain
that our supervision is as tight and effective as possible.

Inasmuch aS DID is actively investigating the
terrorists who are in violation of these laws, it follows
that DID is better prepared to handle these criminal
investigations and handle final prosecutive actions. Not
only would duplicative supervisory action be avoided but
the DID supervisor has at his fingertips a feel of the case,
necessary background data and a full knowledge of sources who
can develop needed evidence.

In 1968, criminal prosecutions of these violations

were handled for most part by Department's Criminal Division
but now the Department has moved to invest the Internal Security
Division with the overall responsibility of prosecuting terrorist
activities regarding above-mentioned matters. Similar reorgani-
zation on our part would certainly enhance more effective
supervision. Of course, any transfer of cases to DID would
require transfer of personnel from GID now handling these matters.

1

i In view of the foregoing, it is recommended that
supervisory responsibility for all violations of Antiriot Laws
and substantive violations of Explosive and Incendiary Devices
Act (Bombing Matters) involving extremist and political
terrorists be transferred from GID to DID together with
required Agent personnel.

BACKGROUND fer

‘

By memorandum W. C, Sullivan to Mr. DeLoach, 8/2/68, it was joint
proposed by Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) and General Investigative Divisio;
{GID} that supervisory responsibility for the new Antiriot Laws investigations
(classification 176) and certain types of bombing matter cases be transférred fro
GiD to DID. With respect to the new FBI j diction in Antiriot Laws, it was p
out in this memorandum that extremist organizations and individuals who will li
be engaged in riots and racial disturbances aH the subject of con’ ng ra
investigations supervised by DID. Similarly many of the bombing cases arise out
of work handled in DID such as bo: mbing of diplomatic establishments and bombings
arising out of activities of groups in the racial field and internal security field.
Following submission of this memorandum, Assistant to the Director DeLoach
proposed and it was approved th Inspection Division thoroughly survey the ent
question in order to ari aw appr op jate guidelines and clearly define responsil
to achieve orderly transition ui Uie propused reassiguuivul of Super visuLy Leepo:

ility in these matters, ae .

| Thorough analysis has been made by Inspection Staff of all aspects of the
proposal and means to accomplish it in the most practicable manner, includ
revicws of representative cases that have been handled under these categories end
the overall volume and work load represented, The logic of the proposed re-
assignments appears unassailable. In both categories of cases the principle
is the same, na: amely; that individual violatioris of applicable statutes arising
the activities of subversive organizations or groups should be supervised wi
same division (Dip) that has the basic and continuing responsibility for supe
of the overall investigations of these organizations and groups as well as of the
members thereof and the development of informars within the groups. The o
benefit to be derived from the reassignment of these categories is the avoidance oj]
duplication of supervisory reviews of these interrelated matters and the ready
identification of individuals who may be involved in a specific violation with pe.
already under investigation from an intelli igence standpoint, Informants who ma:
be utilized in specific violations or who are developed in the course of investig;
of such violations must of necessity be closcly correlated with the supervision of
these informant programs which now rests with DID, Furthermore, violations of
the new Antiriot Laws may well be reveal, _ in the course of general supervision

between GID and DID in these specific cases and DID is thoroughly conversant with

likelihood of additional such bom ings arising in the future by the same gv0 up or

SPECTOR E. S. MILLER: For the information of General Investi-
(ESM:wmj 8/23/71) gative Division, by separate write -up

Domestic intelligence Division (DID)
was advised that Assistant to the Director Sullivan ms suggested that DID be
divided into two separate Divisions. In order that suggestion could be analyzed
during current inspection, DID was requested to furnish certain observations
regarding suggestion. Among these, Division was asked "In the event you feel
work now being handled by another Division should te realigned in the event
above suggestion adopted, so indicate under appropriate new Division."

DID responded, "It will be noted that supervision of antiriot and bombing
cases currently in General Investigative Division has been included in table of
organization of proposed Domestic Intelligence Division and specifically assigned
to the Extremist Intelligence Section. Four Agents and two clerks are now
assigned to this Unit in the General Investigtive Division and should, of course,
be transferred to the new Division.

"This is the most logical move and will afford tighier and mure eifective
supervision of antiriot and bombing violations in view of fact that extremists and
terrorists mostly involved are being actively investigated by Domestic Intelligence
Division (DID). Accordingly, in addition to avoiding duplicative supervisory
action, it follows that DID is better prepared to handle these criminal investigations
and final prosecutive actions."

A separate white write-up captioned "Anti-Rist Laws and Bombing Matters"
was prepared and DID asked specifically to comment regarding these matters.
This addendum is part of that write-up.

‘You are requested to furnish your views of Mr. Sullivan's suggestion both
as to the present structure of DID and as to the handling in the event DID is
split. For your information, DID has proposed ARE and Bombing Matters
be handled in the Extremist Intelligence Section.

Comments of. Assistant Director Rosen requested. It would be appréicated
if you would expedite this request.

ADDENDUM

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ROSEN: The following comments are equally
(AR:ige) - 4 se? applicable whether the Domestic:
Intelligence Division remains intact

or is reorganized into two divisions.

Transferring these cases to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) would
eliminate much duplication of handling cases and would result in increased
efficiency; however, this would require transferring to DID all bombing and
antiriot cases as distinguished from transferring only those cases known to
involve "extremists and political terrorists." As a practical matter substantially
all antiriot laws investigations involve extremists and political terrorists. With
regard to bombings, substantially all investigations deal at the outset with unknown
subjects and it would be most impractical to attempt to delineate between bombings
which do or do not involve terrorists. Since the act of bombing is in itself an act
of terror it is logical to assume at the outset that terrorists are involved and the
types of bombings delegated to the FBI by the Department's guidelines are limited
to those targets most likely to be selected by political terrorists. (These targets
pertain to Government property or functions, Federally funded projects,
diplomatic establishments, colleges and universities, and those probably
perpetrated by terrorists. )

COMPUTATION OF CASE AND WORK LOAD IN THE 5-A-le

i ‘
i
HPPTOR E. 8S. MILLER: I have been advised that a new system of

computing case and work load has been
lemented within your Division. Describe and state reason for implementation.

It would appear that utilization of this system will result in a decrease
in case load figures but not necessarily in the work load picture. You are
requested to advise by Section and Unit basis the number of cases it is
anticipated that the case load will decline in each instance. Use a "before"
and "after" approach. Case load figures 7/31/71 will be satisfactory for use
as known base (before). Be as specific as possible.

ADDENDUM: 5-A-1c : a f cf

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR Cc, D. pina 25 ia February, 1971, I issued
(MSR amt) instructions that each Section
ee hief submit monthly case load figures for his Section to the
Branch Chiefs to be furnished to me with the Branch Chief's
“Ne » analysis as a basis for establishing a logical and current

- method of periodically assessing work loads dnd manpower
«needs within the Division. Inasmuch as it was intended
these figures would serve as a guide for possible manpower
- changes to meet fluctuating and ever-changing problems, it was
. essential that figures presented be accurate and equally
, essential that like matters be tabulated uniformly.

e : “on ‘August 6, 1971, I instructed that a ‘study ‘be made
‘ to insure consistency not only in the counting of the cases

_ but in-the presentation of the monthly reports. As a result
Of this study, guidelines were firmly established concerning
* ease counts within the various Sections, Changes from prior
.figures principally relate to cases involving (1) security
informants (2) Security Index cases (3) certain organizations
and. other matters requiring only Periodic reports. 7

Under the standardized procedures for case counts
within the Division, informant cases, whether relating to
security informants or PSIs, once initial approval by ‘the
Bureau for designation has been granted and where active
lay~to-day supervision is not necessary, are no longer retained

in’ a. pending status but are closed and placed on an adminstrative
tickler. to be reopened at the appropriate time to follow for

.the periodic justification letters required. Cases involving
Security Index subjects as well as certain organizations and

‘: other matters requiring only the submission of periodic reports

~ at no less than six month intervals, are now opened on a uniform + :
basis 15 days after the due date of the periodic report in

order that appropriate followup may be eae to insure aalenrcaaae

/.0f report. Hea! 2 7 7

SeeCmETaEeaeer format was devised for the Section Chiefs to submit
the monthly data required and to acwunt for each Agent in the
-‘Seetion and his current assignments as well as total_.and

‘average case load figures by Unit ‘and by Section. - DESSeCERBEEEeTECanaG

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 354



Pursuant to your request, there follows a tabulation
of-the case load by Unit and by Section as of 7/31/71 and as
of 8/20/71. Total case load for the Division decreased from

~ 29,565 to 25,417--a decrease of 4,148 cases. Some small
part of this decrease can be attributed to normal month by
month fluctuation in case load; most of it is attributable

. ‘to the changed procedures concerning case count as will be

. readilysevident by the significant decreases in case loads

“in those Units handling principally informant cases, Klan-

- cases, and organizational-type cases. This reduction in case
load resulting from the changed case count procedures, of course,

. in no way decreases the work load on.the individual desks, It
is believed the current procedures for counting cases is more
accurate and equitable and places the case load figures in

. perspective insofar as these figures are a “factor in judging

POTENTIAL DOUBLE AGENT PROGRAM 5-A-1-d
ESPIONAGE SECTION

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVEION
ZBbhor E. 8S. MILLER: "Double Agent" (DA) is 2 commonly and frequently

used term in the field of espionage and counter -
intelligence. In the Bureau's activities in these fields, DAs are a distinctive
group of Security Informants (SIs) utilized against foreign intelligence operations
in the United States. "Potential Double Agent" (PDA) is a unique term used by
DID to identify an individual under development as a DA; one who is in contact
with a foreign intelligence officer but who has not yet been solicited by his foreign
contact to perform clandestinely or covertly for the benefit: of the foreign intelligence
group.

. Dering this inspection 2 representative number of
reviewed to determine the extent of supervision afforded PDAs. A si
review was conducted last inspection. It is realized, however, that a comparison
is not possible in view of recent DID instructions regarding the administrative handling
of all SI and PSI files.

Subsequent to last inspection DID established procedure whereby
those SI cases requiring day-to-day supervision or PSiIs still under investigation
should remain in active status; informant-type cases requiring only periodic
review are closed and placed on administrative tickler, to be made pending 15
‘days after the six-month justification letter is due. DA and PDA files are
included in these categories.

During the last inspection 237 files were reviewed. Included
in that group were PSIs and DESECOs, and not limited to PDAs. All of the files
were then in a pendirg status. During this inspection there were 65 files on
PDAs in a pending status and_212 PDA files in a closed status. These were strictly
PDA files and did not ind ude other PSIs or DESECOs. It has been determined
-that at any given time there will probably be approximately 70 such cases in a
pending status, if the number of such investigations in the field remains constant.

Of the 65 pending files, 58, or 89%, were reviewed. Of these,

22. or 38% contained specific instructions, directions or other guidance to the field

NW 55151 DoclId:32989638 Page 258 oF /


NW 55151 DocId;32989638 Page 259 oA

2-

Since last inspection. At the time of last inspection of 237 files reviewed, less than
10, or 4%, contained such outgoing communications.

Also during this inspection 62 closed files on PDAs were
reviewed at random, Of these, 12 or 19%, contained outgoing communications
of the type described above since last inspection. It was observed that since
last inspection a majority of the closed files contained only the six-month
justification letter and were closed in accordance with Division instructions
described above.

Due to current Division instructions, only those PDAs
requiring day-to-day supervision or those on whom six-month justifications
are due are considered pending at any given time. Hence, itis logical thata
larger percentage of the closed PDA files will contain only the justification
letters and no outgoing correspondence since last inspection.

It is well recognized that the field of DAs is a highly specialized
one. Its success, both at the Seat of Government and in the field, requires
skillful handiing, patienve, finesse aud careful aggressiveness. In reviewing the
PDA files, it was observed that many excellent candidates, with varying back -
grounds, have reached various stages of development with excellent potential for
use as actual DAs. -Specifically, these cases are:

105 -113525 184 -11898
105 -141001 134 -15414
105 -201286 1834-18458
105 -207600 184 -19684
105 -26896 134 -19961

134 -20321

- 1384-20912

The quality of these PDAs would, in itself, suggest substantial
potential and, in turn, need for greater supervision. The above-listed cases
should be kept in a pending status, carefully reviewed, with guidance and instructions
furnished to the field. The field should be instructed to assume a more aggressive-
position in these cases and followed closely to insure proper attention is given to
development of these persons as PDAs,

Review of PDA files shows evidence of closer supervision
Since last inspection. The percentage of files, including ins tructions and guidance
to the field, rose from 4% to 38%. However, to realize greater accomplishments
in this area of responsibility and to use our PDAs to the fullest extent, there is
still need for improvement in supervision of these cases.

Comments of Section Chief W. A. Branigan, Inspector D. E.
Moore, and Assistant Director Brennan requested. Y

Section Chief William A SG anigan The comments of the Inspector
GS:EWL:pdr 8/30/71) regarding the marked improve-
ment in supervision of our
work is most. gratifying. As was noted during the last inspection,
evidence of supervision appearing in the PDA informant file is not
always a completely accurate gauge of the supervisory attention
being given each case. The informant file is designed, by pro-
visions of the Manual of Instructions, to be a repository for
information regarding the background and administrative handling
of the source. Information reflecting operational activities and
instructions more often appears in the active investigative file
of the Soviet-bloc principal with whom the PDA is in contact.

In view of this significant factor, it is felt that the
marked increase in supervision (from 4% to 38%) detected through
review of informant files alone, is a most favorable trend and one
which every Srcent will be made to sustain.

Twelve specific cases have been cited as quality PDAs
which, by their very nature, suggested a need for greater super~
vision due to the substantial potential of each. The Inspector
has instructed that these cases be kept in a pending status,
carefully reviewed, with guidance and instructions furnished to the
field to assume a more aggressive position in these cases. These
instructions are appreciated and will be followed. As the
Inspector has noted, the development of double agents is a highly
specialized field requiring special faculties, not the least of
which is careful aggressiveness. As these comments recognize,
aggressiveness in the development of a double agent is inhibited
‘by the practical necessity to restrict our manipulation of the
sources to actions which appear naturally responsive to the
-initiatives displayed and opportunities offered by the Soviet-bloc
representative with whom the source is in contact, Particularly
is this true during the development phase before the source has
been accepted as bona fide by his principal. Any unnatural or
gratuitous action to hasten or strengthen the relationship is
viewed with utmost skepticism and could result in compromise of
our interest and rejection of the source. This is not to say we
must eschew any initiatives; but that any such options must be
pursued only after careful consideration of all the complex and
variable factors peculiar to each individual case.

Section Chief William A, Branigan
(CGS : EWL: pdr 8/30/71)

Within this perspective the 12 cases referred by
the Inspector will be kept open for intensive review to insure
that all possible action not already taken to enhance and
exploit the potential of each source has heen considered
- and, where appropriate, additional instructions issued to
the field.

It is noted that 10 of the 12 PDA cases referred to
were in a closed status in accordance with recent DID instructions
regarding the administrative handling of all SI and PSI files.
Briefly under these procedures such cases are placed in a
closed status and are reopened only at such time as a justi-
fication letter is due. These criteria will continue to be
applied to PDA cases with exceptions, on a selective basis,
in those situations which fall within the category defined
by the Inspector. .

Inspector D. E. er
(am: bsf 8/31/71) Z

The continual need for quality double agents
is certainly recognized in our counterintelligence efforts
- against Soviet bloc intelligence and the cases referred to
by the Inspector as excellent candidates will be given
eareful and aggressive handling.

ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL’ 6-E
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D, BRENNA Attached find the Section
(CDB:amk) 8/30/71 write-ups concerning each

category of information
requested by the Inspector relative to adequacy of personnel.
These comments are current as of August 17, 1971.

The personnel assigned to the Division Front Office
consist of one Assistant Director, two Inspectors, two Special
Agent Supervisors, five stenographic employees and twenty
clerical employees. This complement includes the personnel
directly assigned to the Front Office, those in the Division
teletype room and Mail Room and Messenger Service, and the
Security Patrol force in addition to five Agents.

. The overall authorized personnel complement of the
Division at the beginning of Inspection was 120 Special Agents
and 199 clerks, compared to an authorized complement of 116
Special Agents and lyU clerks at tne time of the iast Inspéction.

: As of August 17, 1971, we had 119 Special Agents
assigned to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). This
includes 2 Special Agents who are assigned on a temporary loan
basis to the Intelligence Evaluation Committee in the Department
of Justice (IEC). Since August 17, 1971, SA Dean N. Lloyd
reported to the Research Section as a replacement for SA Bernard A.

’ Wells, who retired on 7/30/71. We are awaiting the replacement
for SA Victor R. Schaefer who was transferred to Salt Lake City
on 7/23/71 as Assistant Special Agent in Charge of that office.

SA George M. Quinn has been designated as SA Schaefer's
replacement but has not as yet reported to his asSignment. With
the reporting of SA Quinn, our assigned complement will be 121 in
view of the fact that SA Garnett T. Tunstall (on loan to IEC

from Extremist Intelligence Section) has been replaced and we
include SA Tunstall in our total assigned complement.

As of August 17, 1971, we had 204 clerical employees
assigned to DID. ‘This is because recent replacements have
reported to replace employees under transfer or resignation who
have not left as yet. Since August 17, 1971, we had two
additional clerks, GS-4, report to the Division. However, we
have had two resignations submitted which will absorb them,

We have one Section with an additional employee assigned which is
dependent entirely upon the approval of a new position involving
no increase in grade or salary. 7

" This Division consists of six Sections. The attached
write-ups of the Section Chiefs disclose adequate authorized
Agent complement with exception of R. D. Cotter, Research; and
W. R. Wannall, Nationalities Intelligence Sections. Authorized
is underscored since Agent personnel are on loan to the Nationalities
Intelligence Section because of the McLek Case as follows:
Espionage (1), Extremist Intelligence (2), Internal Security (2),
Research (1), and New Left (12).

| Concerning comment in write-up of R. D. Cotter, Research,
Item 6 refers to assignment of Cotter on a temporary basis to
Department and need for complete staffing of that Front Office.
Originally Cotter's assignment to the Department was not considered
to be full time in that he was to be in the same building, readily
available for consultation, and capable of handling special problems
whieh might arise. However, the situation is not desirable for a
long term arrangement and the term of that assignment is not known.
Recognizing this, the adjustment of work assignments detailed in
my memorandum to Mr. Sullivan of 7/29/71 proposed elimination of
one Section, making Section Chief Arbor Gray available to take over the
Research Section. This would eliminate that problem with no
additional personnel required, That proposal also makes No. 1
Man Callahan of Internal Security. Section available for case
assignment.

Concerning write-up of Section Chief W. R. Wannall,
several points must be considered. Wannall's suggested build-up
of the Chinese Unit to five men from present complement of three
at this time to "handle the current work in the Unit and expand
into areas which are considered necessary .. ." is reflective of
a’ provincial outlook and a limited concept of the relative
importance of proposed work in his area of responsibility in
relation to the overall limitation of Bureau manpower and resources.
Obviously some differentiation must be made to establish priorities,
We must first cope with the immediate problems at hand before
assigning manpower to projected pr oblems,

Concerning Wannali's reference to needing aman for the
| Foreign Liaison Desk, my observations contained in my memorandum
to Mr.Sullivan dated 8/16/71, which is attached to Wannall's
write-up, still apply. I would add to that an observation that
much of the material received from our Legats is actually handled
on the related substantive intelligence desks responsible for the
respective countries and not by the Foreign Liaison Desk. With
the current special cases requiring extensive manpower commitments,
I believe that desk can continue as is until the manpower situation:
is alleviated somewhat.

As to Wannall's comments concernihg manpower on the
Ellsberg case, under write-up captioned "Elisberg Case," 4A3,

the personnel assigned to Ellsberg is certainly adequate and he

does not at-this point request additional personnel for that case.

There are two interrelated but separate problems to be
dealt with here, The first, and broadest, is divisionwide
adequacy of personnel and the Director has repeatedly stated
the concept that major case specials must be handled with existing
Division personnel, IJagree with this wholeheartedly and have
attempted to comply with that concept,

Also related here is the situation which uniquely affects thq
Domestic Intelligence Division in that our basic area of responsi-
bility has been subjected to shifting patterns of work. Essentially,
the rise of the black extremist was largely met with reduction
in other work areas. The newer expanding threat of New Left
terrorist activities is similarly being met by reduction of
personnel committed to other areas of work of less urgent priorities.

Obviously, there are practical limits: to the elasticity
of manpower and our overall increase in caseload is indicative
of considerable strain on our manpower capabilities. Facts
concerning this increase are contained under "Pending Work and
Delinquency," 4-D-1.

I believe, however, we can adequately cope with our
responsibilities with existing personnel. In order to accomplish
this, considerable study and review of existing administrative
practices have been made at my direction since taking over this
Division 8/1/70. In order to put available personnel where
highest priorities existed, a major reorganization was effected
12/70 and our last inspection approved that action. The Director's
letter dated 2/12/71 advising me of the Inspection Staff findings
included the comment, "Continue to pay careful attention to
imbalances in work load throughout the Division and take necessary
action to correct these a aehaedaa as you did recently in your
reorganization."

; With this in mind, and drawing on facts developed
during the reorganization and subsequent inspection, I directed
@ memorandum to Branch Chiefs J, A. Sizoo and D, E. Moore dated
2/19/71 pointing to (1) the need for case count to reflect active
matters, (2) their responsibility to know what is going on in
their respective Branches and (3) specifically instructing them
to submit a monthly analysis of the work load of their Branches,

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION INSPECTION

ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL 6-E

The need for uniformity in case count submitted by Sections was
stressed to them, as was the need to establish a logical and
current basis for a regular and periodic assessment of work loads
and manpower needs within the Division. :

Because of (1) a continued shift in manpower needs, and
(2) a growing imbalance in caseloads between Sections and
manpower demands of special cases, by memorandum to all Branch
and Section Chiefs, I instructed Section Chiefs G. C. Moore and
R. L. Shackelford to conduct a thorough survey of the Division
and make suitable recommendations for manpower adjustments to
cope with current needs of the Division. My memorandum to
“Mr. Sullivan dated 7/29/71 Mnelietatnoee their findings and recommended 5
they be approved. 7 ‘|

Addendum of Inspection Division 7/30/71 approved this H|
except for assignment of Special Coordination Unit to Research ;
Section, recommending it be retained in Nationalities Intelligence
Section. Mr. Felt's memorandum to Mr. Tolson dated 8/4/71
recommended proposed adjustment of work assignments in Domestic

- Intelligence Division be deferred pending his study and Director
noted, "OK. Expedite." We are awaiting a decision.

Based on figures developed during the survey of G. C.
Moore and R. L. Shackelford, it was obvious my previous instructions
to the Branch Chiefs had not been effectively carried out, because
case count figures still were not as meaningful or consistent
-between Sections as they should have been. To correct this
Situation and to establish what I intended in my original
.memorandum to the Branch Chiefs on this subject, I instructed
two Supervisors, with Inspection Staff experience, to do a complete
survey of case counting procedures and prepare tight recommenda-
tions to achieve the objectives previously sought. :

BERPEeHREPAnENOEs

This was done, and after discussion of their findings
with Branch and Section Chiefs, .these new procedures were adopted
beginning 8/13/71. The results of this procedural change is
detailed in "Pending Work and Delinquency," 4-D-1, and I believe:
validates the recommended work adjustments contained in my
memorandum to Mr, Sullivan dated 7/29/71.

It must be strongly pointed out here this procedural
change does not bear on work load, but rather deals solely with
tabulation of case count into a more accurate gauge of pending
work and where the work is by desk, Unit, and Section. The

Work remains the same.

The proposed work adjustments contained in my
memorandum of 7/29/71 essentially took manpower from work
presently in the Internal Security Section (Klan and White
Hate cases and Informant matters) and made them available to
other more heavily loaded work areas. The Front Office staff
of Internal Security Section will be available for other assignment
as well, It also called for Nationalities Intelligence to absorb
one of the five men on Ellsberg from that Section's complement
because of relatively low caseload.

Details set forth in "Pending Work and Delinquency,"
4-D-1, disclose caseload decreased in Nationalities Intelligence
and Internal Security Sections by 19% and 28% respectively, which
is proportionately high compared to other Sections.

Espionage Section was proposed to receive a one-half
man's time to compensate for the Ironclad case, This is consistent
with that Section's 13% decrease in case count under the new
procedure,

That write-up aiso discioses a case count under the
new procedure of 275 cases per Agent for the Nationalities
Intelligence Section compared as follows: Espionage - 303;
Extremist Intelligence - 303; New Left - 334; Internal Security -
401. These figures are based on Supervisors assigned to case
desks and do not include men on specials in any Section.

I, do not believe the problems faced by Nationalities
Latelligence Section far outweigh those of other Sections to
justify that low figure and, therefore, believe my original
-recommendation that Nationalities Intelligence absorb one man from
existing complement was justified. W. R. Wannall’s comments in
write-up captioned "Ellsberg Case," 4-A-3, relative to manpower
presently utilized on is case validate this further as he has
now utilized manpower in his Section on this case. Obviously,
tangential issues will arise from time-to-time in an investigation
of this type and can and should be handled on an emergency basis
within the Section handling the special. This has been the
traditional practice and should be followed.

The second problem is essentially intra-divisional in
nature and deals with a Division Head's responsibility and authority
to effectively utilize resources available to him to cope with

the area of responsibility levied upon him.| As detailed in
Wannall's write-up captioned, Ellsberg Case," 4~A~-3, from the
beginning of this case I made Manpower available for the Elisberg
case as requested by him. As this investigation progressed,
however, Wannall continued to levy demands for manpower which I
believed unwarranted in view of (1) his failure to effectively
adjust and use his existing manpower at a time when he had a
proportionately low case load and (2) his granting extensive

leave to personnel in his Section while continuing to levy manpower
demands.

Wannall now claims to have nine men assigned to the
Ellsberg case. I invite comparison of the handling of the Elisbers
CaSE"TO"Eastcon. Eastcon at no time has had over 5 men assigned
full time to it, even though the case is of the very highest
priority and of a magnitude and complexity seldom matched in
Bureau investigations, In addition to the basic and complex
conspiracy itself, the case incorporates six separate substantive
investigations (draft board entries) which had to be brought
up to trial standard for prosecution of Eastcon. There are at
least 85 volumes to the Eastcon file alone at this time, Eastcon
was absorbed within the responsible Section until it was firmly
established that Section's case load could not continue to absorb
the impact of Eastcon. No requests for additional manpower were
refused by me on Eastcon, and those requests made were fully
supported by facts, justified and granted.

In my memorandum to Mr. Sullivan dated 8/12/71, captioned
"Adequacy of Personnel, Leak Cases, Domestic Intelligence Division
(DID) ," I candidly stated my position and evaluation of Wannall's
demands for manpower (copy attached). Attention is invited to
page 2, paragraph 4, concerning the 5 highly qualified and ex~
perienced men available to Wannall, none of whom were being
utilized by him on the Ellsberg case. Attention is also invited
to page 2, paragraph 5, which details Wannall's claim to Mr. Felt
of "enormous" problems and need for still 2 more men. Note that
part of that "enormous" problem was resolved in one week with one
interview, Concerning the first reference your attention is
directed to my memorandum to Mr. Sullivan dated 8/16/71 captioned
"Adequacy of Personnel, Domestic Intelligence Division (DID),"
(copy attached) which attaches a memorandum from Wannall to me
requesting an additional Supervisor for the Special Coordination
Unit. Concerning the second reference above, and the tenor of the
entire memorandum, your attention is invited to Wannall's write-up
in this report captioned "Ellsberg Case," 4-A-3, page 10,
paragraph 1, wherein he states 9 men are now assigned to that
case.

7 These two references and mmr responses to them
clearly draw the issues: (1) Whether he used good judgment and
considered the Bureau and Division overall responsibilities
in balance with his own desires for manpower in making his
requests; (2) When weaknesses in his position were pointed out
whether he attempted to cover them by making even more demands
for manpower hoping this would somehow give them credence and
(3) Whether he or the Division Head should judge the Division's
resources and capabilities and determine their allocation and
priority of need consistent with the Bureau's overall capabilities.

In summary, the work load of the Domestic Intelligence
Division as exemplified by case loads set forth under "Pending
Work and Delinquency," 4=D-1, are very high, Being mindful of
the practical limits of Bureau resources, I believe the currently
proposed adjustment of work assignments detailed in my above
referred to memorandum of 7/29/71 will allow the Domestic
i Intelligence Division to function effectively with existing
| manpower. The new method of tabulating case count affords me a
petier adwinistrative dcvice to-obtain- maximum utilization of
existing manpower and periodic adjustments within the Division will
no doubt be warranted and made.

The observations of the Inspection Staff as to the
validity of manpower committed to the Elisberg case, as well as
overall manpower needs of the Domestic Intelligence Division, are
welcomed,

Memorandum C, D, Brennan to W. C, Sullivan See :
Re: ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL : : 7 i

re *
BS

Hr. Felt's memorandum 8/4/71 indicates he discussed the manpower
- problem on the leak cases with Wannall who said his problems had now
become so great he would need 2 more men for a total of 7.

«Xa line with Mr. Felt*s stated intention to initiate an overall
study ef the matter, I had Myr. Wannall submit to me an overall analysis
of his manpower and vork load as it relates to the leak cases in his
section, Set forth are the case load figures fer Mr. Wannall‘'s section
from March 1 = August 1, 1971:

324 fated fieaueind

an March 1 -
. - Apgil 2 - 322 fete -
Hay 1 - 313 f :
. June 1 - 291 7
a duly 1 ~ . 292-
August 1 - 294

When the Elishexg case first broke, Wannall assured me he was
using hig existing manpover to the fullest extent possible and needed
temporarily assistance from other sections to carry on the other heavy
burdens of his section, but the caso load figures now available for the
Six-week period from 6/15/71 to $/l1/7i show thai ali WALL did was
his owa men on the special (5 men) and borrow manpower {5 men) from other
sections to keep bis other problems im hand at the sacrifice of other
sections with equally or even more burdensome probiens,

This is shown by the fact that for June and july the case load
average in Wannall's section while handling the Blisberg ease was 292
and 294 respectively as contrasted to a Division case foad average for
@il sections during the same period ef 3239 and 335. This does not even
take into consideration that he kas 5 highly experienced and qualified
supervisors in the Special Coordination Unit whom he does not include in
his case load count. He could have drawn on at least one of these men
for special assignment in an emergency but did not. 7

Actually, it is now clear that Wannall responded in the initial
stage of bis problem with a panicky, premature request for additional
Manpower as he subsequently did through his observation to Mr, Felt thst
he needed still 2 more men. In effect, Wannall put DID. in the untenable
position of giving Mr. Felt an off-the-cuff assessmentof£ what he
considered to be an "enormous" problem and a need Yor still 2 nore men
unsupported by facts and oblivious to the problems of the Division as
awhoke. As a matter of fact, one of the leak cases which caused ffannall|
great alarm was referred to us by the Departnent on 8/2/71. By letter
dated 8/9/71 Wannall advised the Department that we had conducted one
interview which showed that prosecution could not be entertained and
accordingly would condi.gt no further investigation in the absence of

Re: ADEQUACY CF PERSON i Teese
specific instructious, Therefore, one part of Wannallts “enormous
problem was resolved in one week with one interview and one letter to,
the Department. :

. O£ equal concern to me is VWannali's handling ef leave requests
. during the period of 6/15/71 to 8/6/71. When confronted with the Elisber,
ease, he had discussed leave with me and had suggested that if it Was
necessary for hin to cancel leave requests in his wection he felt leave
should be cancelled throughout the entire Division. I told him it would
be ridiculous tc cancel leave Division-wide because one section had a
problem, I advised him leave throughout the Division would be approved
on the basis of sound judgment in relation to.overall Division work icac
and in accordance with the Director's instructions concerning individuaic
involved on major cages. He
X have ascertained that since 6/15/71 Wannall has approved leave
for 12 supervisors in bis section totaling 763 hours. This is an averace
of nearly & days per man for each of those 12, He approved these exten-
sive leave requests during the same period that he advised his probiexs
were so “enormous that he needed 7 additional men.
OBSERVATIONS : :
‘Hestorically, the Bureau has learned to live with specials of
various kinds. Z-agree with the concept that such specials are a test
of the responsible official's ability to haudle- them within the frane-
work of the Bureau‘s overall responsibilities and capabilities, In like
manner, I expect no less from supervisory personnel under me and will
not condone unwarranted attempts to grab manpower within the Division
regardiess of whether the attempts are based on an inability to think
clearly, an incapacity to adjust to a stress situation, or oversight
_Tesviting from a provincial attitude and outlook.

DID has absorbed into its periphery of responsibilities many nev
probiem areag involving racial and new left extremists in recent years.
These problems have taxed our ingenuity and resulted in across-tre-board
heavy work load increases brought about by the need ta flexibly realign
manpower to meet new challenges. When other priorities of the Eureau
have precluded additional’ manpower being added to DID, I have attempted
to take the positive approach of making internal adjustments to fulfill
our responsibilities with available resources. :

In this vain, there is attached a copy of a mewoxandum I prepared

for all Branch and Section Chiefs of DID dated 7/23/71 which resulted
in my memorandum to Mir. Sullivan of 7/23/71 recommending DID manpower

by Congress for the implementation of Executive Order 11605
‘which broadened the powers of the Subversive Activities Control
Board (SACB) to enable the Board to hold hearings and designate
violence-prone extremist organizations as subversive. The
Department has indicated that it intends to initiate proceedings
before the SACB as soon as possible and there are a number of
organizations’ being handled in the Internal Security Section,
such as the Revolutionary Union and Progressive Labor Party,
which are likely to be selected for presentation. Based on past

ce 7 Criteria used in assessing personnel adequacy in this
: Section includes a number of diverse factors. As pointed out in prior
“inspections, case load figures are not applicable, neither are there any ©
., other simple qualitative measurements of the Section's work, Research
. Section is essentially the service arm of the Division and handles a
. wide variety of assignments involving research, study and analysis. Of
.. primary importance is production of a variety of documents aimed at
:, providing the White House, Attorney General, other high level Government
- officials and Bureau officials current intelligence information relating to
-.the broad spectrum of the Division's work. In addition to the writing of ©
-highly condensed intelligence summaries, digests, and analyses in :
pamphlet form for high level dissemination, the Section provides a daily
teletype summary of racial disorders and developments and of antiwar,
- campus disorders and other disturbances growing out of various protest
activity. The Section also handles all matters which involve the Division
as a whole, where the matter crosses section lines. Director's specials
involving such matters as wire taps, nonspecific topical subjects such as
“ guidelines for internal security investigations, and similar Fatale are |
handied and/or coordinat ated in the Section, fa

The adequacy of pergénnel of the Section depehds ¢ ‘on the
7 demands leveled by the White House or by Bureau officials for the
“ specialized studies and other material which the Section is geared to
“produce on short notice. Demands for intelligence data were extremely *
heavy from the White House prior to and during the election campaign
ast year. It can reasonably be expected that even greater demands will
e placed on the Bureau during the months ahead, and such demands will
- invariably involve the elements of extremism, terrorism, racial and :
~new left agitation and other internal security problems. It is to be noted °
that this Section actually wrote one speech for Vice President Agnew and
“provided the material for inclusion in several others. We also provided
Mr. Agnew with a special brief which was kept updated, for use in
‘5 appearing | before various groups.

Adequacy of Personnel
New Left Section 6-E

4, At time of last inspection, this Section had a complement
of 24 clerical personnel as compared to present assigned
complement of 28 clerical personnel. This increase was
‘occasioned by the transfer of the Protest and Trotskyist
Groups Unit with accompanying personnel from Internal Security
Section to the New Left Section,

Congress recently appropriated funds for implementation of
Executive Order 11605 which broadened power of Subversive
Activities Control Board (SACB) to designate violence prone
extremist organizations as subversive. The Department has
indicated it intends to initiate these proceedings as soon as
possible (See R. L. Shackelford memorandum to Mr. C. D.
Brennan, August 16, 1971, captioned "Executive Order 11605").
This Section handles a number of organizations which will
undoubtedly be selected by the Department for presentation
before the SACB. Based on past experience, the preparation
of cases for presentation to the SACB creates a considerable
increase in work of a clerical nature, If the Department's
intention in this regard is implemented, it will be necessary
to obtain an additional clerk in the future, however, we are
not requesting any additional clerical personnel at this time.

5. The New Left Section, as of January, 1971, had an

‘authorized complement of 22 Agents and 23 clerks, Current

assigned complement is 26 Agmts and 28 clerks. This increase
in complement, as noted above, was occasioned by the transfer
of the Protest and Trotskyist Groups Unit from the Internal
Security Section to the New Left Section.

6. The caseload being handled by the New Left Section (average
371 cases per Agent as of August 1, 1971) is considered excessive,
We are, at the present time, making a conscientious effort to
reduce this caseload to desirable level by weeding out and
elosing cases which-do not require additional investigation,

If, in spite of our efforts, the upward trend continues, it may
be necessary to request additional Agent personnel to handle

the excessive caseload in this Section.

As noted in number 4 above, it is anticipated that as a
result of recent Congressional action, the Department intends to
soon present violence prone extremist organizations before the
SACB for designation as subversive. Such presentations wili,

of necessity, include several organizations currently handled
by this Section, Based on past experience, the preparation of

a case for presentation before the SACB requires the services
of one supervisor on a full-time basis. No request is being
made at this time for additional Agent personnel, However,
based on the above, it appears that a request for one additional
Agent will be necessary when the above proceedings are.
instituted,

7. Adequacy of personnel in the New Left Section is constantly
evaluated on basis of caseload and type of cases handled by
each Unit, review of delinquency reports, number of requests
received from Department and other agencies, and review of the
overall objectives of the Section. When it is noted, because
of special circumstances, that an excessive amount of work

is temporarily assigned to one Unit, personnel from other Units
are utilized to alleviate the situation.

not excessive at the present time,

(5). Since the last. inspection the Special Agent
complement of the Espionage Section has been reduced by two.
At the time of the last inspection the Espionage Section had a
total case load of 5,089 cases, of which 141 were handled by
clerical personnel in lieu of Agent personnel. There was,
therefore, an average of 275 pending investigations per Agent
Supervisor. As of July 31, 1971, the Espionage Section had a>
total of 5,575 cases, of which 270 were handled by clerical
personnel, This provided an average of 331 pending investigations
for each Agent Supervisor.

(6) By memorandum June 4, 1971, a request was made to
increase the Special Agent complement by one Special Agent.
This was predicated on an increase in the volume and complexity
of investigations handled. The request was denied. By memorandum
duly 14, 1971, I asked to increase the Special Agent complement
by one in order that the Ironclad case could be assigned the
full-time job of one Special Agent. Ironclad is a unique source
of the Bureau and it is important that information from this source
is given the analysis and consideration that it deserves, This
request was denied, and. the Special Agent complement of the
Espionage Section was fixed at 18, In light of President Nixon's
recent request to cut back, no request for additional Special Agent
personnel is being made and the present complement is considered
adequate, e SEEBES :

(7) Criteria utilized in determining the adequacy of
personnel includes the volume of cases supervised, the complexity
of the cases, and the importance of the investigation,

In the Soviet Units - Washington and New York, we are
currently handling 2,190 cases among an authorized complement of

seven Special Agents. The greatest majority of our double agent
cases are assigned in these Units and these are among the most
complex investigations. The operation of a double agent requires
minute supervision to insure that the objectives of the investi-
gation are achieved, The Soviet Unit - Washington also supervises
two illegal agent cases, and the Soviet Unit ~ New York has the
overall supervision of the Ironclad source,

The Satellite Unit, which supervises the investigations
in the Polish, Romanian, Czechoslovakian, and Yugoslav nationality
fields, has a total of 1,408 investigations, including the informants
and double agents that are being directed against the Soviet-bloc
establishments and personnel, There is, therefore, an average of
852 investigations in this Unit.

The Coordination Unit is currently handling 1,226
investigations, of which 178 are assigned to a Clerk in lieu of
an Agent, Considering that this Unit has the responsibility for
a number-of special subjects and special onerations, ineinding
the adaptation of our records to automatic data processing
equipment, the case load is considered very high.

In our Special Cases Unit there are currently 751
investigations, of which 92 are handled by a Clerk in lieu of
an.Agent. These investigations are divided among two Special
Agents, The figure of 751 compares favorably with the total of
768 at the time of the last inspection, which number was divided
among three Special Agents.

(1) There are no clerical or supervisory vacancies
in the Section.

(2) No one is under transfer into or out of the
Section. :

(3) There is no shortage or overage of authorized
personnel.

(4) The clerical personnel assigned to the Section
is considered adequate at this time.

(5) The streamlining of our operations wherever
. possible to effect manpower savings is under continual
evaluation. Examples of streamlining measures taken since
the last inspection include: (1) Abolishment of the Agitator
Index on 4/21/71 as an analysis revealed that it was no longer
the necessary administrative tooi that Li once was; (2) -After--
consultation with the Department, discontinued submission of
monthly evidentiary reports concerning the Black Panther Party
on May 14, 1971. At the time this program was discontinued,
23 field offices were submitting monthly evidentiary reports .
averaging 37 pages in length; (3) Limited the scope of inves-
-tigations,of black student groups on college campuses to

those groups which have engaged in violence and/or lawless
.activities or are moving toward violence or lawlessness.by
letter to all offices 7/26/71; (4) Assigned additional duties
to clerical personnel in effort to reduce the workload of
Special Agent Supervisors. Specifically, a clerk is now
handling the Black Extremist Bureau Fugitive List, correlates
the receipt and review of publications and newspapers dealing
with the black nationalist movement, reviews and forwards

to appropriate field offices information received from the
military on black extremist in the Armed Forces, and handles
eertain correspondence with the National Security Agency
concerning matters of mutual interest.

In addition, we continue to utilize our teletype
dissemination facilities to the maximum extent possible

(6) The Special Agent complement is 22 including
‘the Section Chief and Number One Man, an increase of one
since the last inspection. The Division was reorganized
December 17, 1970, on the basis of approximate case load
per Supervisor of 279. This figure was based on the
October 1, 1970, case load figures. As of January 1, 1971,
the case load stood at 349 per Supervisor and a request for
two additional Special Agent Supervisors was approved. The
opening of cases on Black Student Union-type organizations
and leaders thereof on college campuses across the Nation
in December, 1970, showed up in our case load figures during
the early months of 1971. These cases have been handled and
closed by the end of the 1970-1971 school year. As of
August 1, 1971, the case load stood at 5,428 or an average
of 271 per Supervisor assigned. These cases represent hard-
core extremist individuals and organizations and require
extensive supervision.

Additional factors dealing with the adequacy of
personnel.is a speciel that vas received in the Section on
May 29, 1971, involving the killing of two police officers
in New York City on May 21, 1971, which the President instructed
the FBI to investigate and solve. The supervision of this
investigation occupies the full time of one Supervisor. In
addition, one Supervisor was placed on loan to the Nationalities
Intelligence Section on July 19, 1971, and a second Supervisor
. was placed’ on loan to that Section on August 13, 1971.

With the return of these two Supervisors to the
Section, I consider the supervisory personnel as adequate.

’ There are several factors that would indicate that
our work in the black extremist field will increase in the
immediate future, With the reopening of school in the *
immediate future, we.can foresee an influx of cases involving
extremist Black Student UNion-type groups and leaders thereof.

Executive Order 11605 signed by the President on

July 2, 1971, expanded the activities of the Subversive
Activities Control Board (SACB). The Department has advised

27 fa

that a Section has been formed within the Internal Security
Division of the Department to file petitions before the SACB
pursuant to Executive Order 11605 and that the Department

is interested in proceeding as quickly as possible against
such parties as the Black Panther Party and the Ku Klux Klan
among others. Such proceedings will materially increase

the workload of the Section. :

Under the proposed reorganization of the Division
which is under consideration at this time, this Section, if
such reorganization is approved, will handle all Klan and
white-hate organizations, individuals and informants with
the present supervisory complement. In this connection,
the informant cases are adoptable to full assimilation into
our present extremist informant setup and a great deal of
the work in connection with the handling of these informants
will be assigned the responsibility of two grade 6 clerical
employees in the Black Nationalist - South and Racial Informant
Unit. -In order to absorb the : .
tions and individuals, they will be assigned in accordance
with the geographic breakdown we are presently using within
the four Units in the Section.

an ond white-hat

BRevoteret

Black extremist activity in this country is
developing more and more in international aspects. Residents
- of other countries including U. S. citizens and noncitizens
are involved in clandestine and overt operational activity
among racial extremists. We have targeted Central Intelligence
Agency as well as our Legal Attaches abroad for the develop-
ment of data regarding foreign influence in the black
extremist movement. We have levied requirements and are
expanding on such requirements on the National Security
Agency which has vast capabilities in developing the type
of information needed.

: (7) In evaluating personnel adequacy, we take into
consideration not only the case load which is compiled on a.
monthly basis but also results of periodic mail counts taken
on a quarterly basis. Many of our cases on key figures in
the black extremist movement such as Huey P, Newton, Eldridge
Cleaver, James Forman, LeRoi Jones, and others require a
considerable amount of supervisory attention.

DOMESTIC INTELL

REQUES'

: Fully mindful of the urgent matters requiring
additional personne] in the DID (Gast Coast Conspiracy} aad
particularily the Nationalities Intelligence Section Gh 2
and other leak cases), we must ask for help in the supervision:
ot our foreign offices. While our Legat operations are not in
the public eye, they do constitute an important area of cur

“work which must not be overlooked in view of the evaluatian
being placed upon tbem by the Phite House,

En January, Loyl, during the. inspeotion of this
Division, we pointed ont that the expansion of our for.
liaison offices fvom 14 to 47 had come at a time when z
FLD Supervisors had been barely able to keep up with the flow
of paper let alone actually examine and analyse it in order to
afford conus$ructive supervision to the foreign offices. Fe
noted tha heavy demands made on the time of these two
Supervisors in welcoming and supervising the visits to tke
Bureau of the many foreign dignitaries who are vaiuable aud
cooperative contacts of our Legats and the 62% increase corer
the past ten years in the Foreign Police Cooperation cases being
handled, We pointed out that the Supervisors should be
paring memoranda to keen the Director fully apprised of
work being done by our Agents abroad but just did rot haye tine
to do this, As a result of the inspection, memorandums 2/1/72
from ir. Felt to Hr. Tolson secussd appreval for addition of one
man for assignment to the 3D. He reported 2/22/71. Conten-
poranvously, it became necessary to assign one Agent Supervisor
on 2 rotating basis to the Ney Left Section on a temporary basis
to assist in the East Coast Couspiracy esse. An Agent from the -
FLD was selectsd for this temporary assignment, effective
4/25/71, which assignment was made pexmanent when all tesporary
assiguments were converted to permanent x ignments, effective
J 71, In effect, therefore, the additionsl man was available
on the FLD cnly during the two months drom 2/29 to 4/26/72,

INSPECTOR E, S. MILLER: During the course of instant inspection an in-depth

dias 9/3/71) survey was made relative to the adequacy of

; allocation of manpower bearing in mind the desirability to reallocate manpower
to top priority assignments.

NW 55151 Docld:32989638 Page 309 7 cae



INTERNAL SECURITY SECTION

Subversive Individuals Unit \

: This Unit has an Agent complement of 5. At the time of the last
inspection it was a 3-man Unit; however, one was assigned on a special in another
Unit, leaving actually two Agenis to handle approximately 1300 cases, or 650
per man. Since the last inspection the case load has increased to appoximately
2600. Consequently, it would appear that 4 men averaging 650 cases per man
could handle the work of this Unit. This position is further strengthened as it
can be anticipated that the case load will decrease since the deadline of lifting
the moratorium expired 6/30/71 and the bulk of investigations have been brought
up to date or will be brought up to date in the near future. By memorandum dated
8/26/71 it was recommended that SA,John.N.Ouellette be returned to the Internal
Security Section due to the slackening of activity in the EASTCON case. Quelletie
was formerly assigned to this Unit and the reduction could be accomplished by
reassignment of him (or another Agent) to more pressing duties elsewhere.

Security Informant Unit

This Unit presently has 4 supervisors assigned; however, one has been
on temporary assignment outside the Unit since June , 1971, The case load as
of 8/71 for this Unit was 869 and would result in about 217 cases per Agent in
a 4-man Unit, and 290 cases per Agent in a 3-man Unit. Further, you have
indicated one of the factors affecting the productivity of the Unit is the necessity
of obtaining authority by memorandum for the utilization of students and/or
.teachers as security informants. It was determined that 122 memos have been
prepared since the last inspection requesting such approval, This is approximate}
1 memo per workday, which does not appear to be an excessive work load. Since
this Unit was formed it has functioned with 3 Special Agent Supervisors. This
does not appear to have effected the efficiency of the operation and in view of the
work and case load it is felt that the Unitcould ania quite bintoincene ie with

2 Special Agent Supervisors.
Klan and White Hate Groups Unit

Under the reorganization of DID proposed by Assistant Director
Brennan in his memorandum of 8/3/71 it was indicated this Unit's cases could b¢
absorbed by the Extre mist Intelligence Section. This would free two Special
Agents for other assignment. Itis felt this could be accomplished even if the
proposed reorganization does not become an actuality.

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 310


ae se

RESEARCH SECTION

It is noted under the proposed reorganization of 8/3/71 a supervisor from
this Section would be reallocated to another. Itis felt this could-be accomplished
regardless of the reorganization. It is noted in this regard that this Section is

| presently operating efficiently with an Agent supervisor assigned to the Elisberg
case. Addressing ourselves to the lack of a Section Chief, it is felt your

| recommendations regardirig filling Mr. Cotter's vacated position should be handled
by separate memorandum. The replacement request fa SA Marion S.Ramev's
transferral to another Division is being handled separately.

NEW LEFT SECTION
Subversive Individuals Unit

’ This Unit has an authorized complement of 6 Agents but is presently
adequately handling the work with 5, one being assigned full time to a special.
Even though the case load is high, approximately 2500, leaving 500 cases
per man, many of the matters are quite routine and can be handled with bare
minimum of supervision. Because of this, Agents assigned to this Unit are able
to handle a large number of cases and it is felt that the Agent presently assigned
to the special should not be returned.

ESPIONAGE AND RACIAL BRANCH
Extremist Intelligence Section

During the last inspection you requested two more supervisors due

to the fact that your case load had increased to a total of 6642, breaking down

to 349 cases per supervisor. Your request was authorized. During May, 1971,
one supervisor was permanently transferred from your Section leaving you

a complement of 20 supervisors plus Section Chief and Number One ‘Man (total
22), No replacement has been requested for this supervisor. Since 7/19/71

you have had one man on loan to the Nationalities Intelligence Section on a rotating
basis and as of 8/9/71 a second man on loan, There has been a definite decrease
‘in your case load since the last inspection. However, a slight increase would

be anticipated due to the absorbing of the Klan and White Hate Groups matters.
For the last 6 weeks you have been without the services of 1 supervisor ona
‘rotating basis and for the last 3 weeks a second one. However, the Unit has
still operated efficiently. As there is an imbalance as to cases and the number.
of men assigned it is felt that 2 supervisors could be transferred out of the
Section leaving 20 (including Section Chief and Number One Man) to handle

the necessary assignments (including Klan and White Hate).

>

Nationalities Intelligence Section

" Middle and South American Unit ,
As of the close of business 8/20/71 the 3-man Cuban Unit had
a case load of 776 and the Middle and South American Unit, also consisting of
3 men, had 598 cases. These two Units, the work of which is closely related
and frequently overlaps, had a total case load of 1374 for 6 men for an average

» case load of 229. If the total case load of these two Units were handled by 5

men the average load would be 275, which appears more equitable in view of the
overall commitments and work load of the Division. In view of the above, itis

felt that the personnel of the Middle and South American Unit could be cut by one
man. With 5 incumbents and with the inter -relation and natural overlapping of these
two Units future fluctuation in the work load could bé equitably handled between the
two Units.

Nationality Unit

Under normal conditions it is believed that this 4-man Unit
could be operated by 3 Supervisors. At present, there are 3 supervisors
assigned this Unit's cases (exclusive of special) and the case load as of 8/20/71
was 632 cases which represents 158 cases per Agent for a 4-man Unit, or 2i1
per Agent for a 3-man Unit. Consequently it is felt that 3 supervisors could
adequately handle the work of this Unit.

AS can be seen, a pool of ll men has been created. Treating those

“assigned on special to the Elisberg case (9) as a separate entity, 2 men

are available for general assignment. One man could be assigned to the
Chinese Unit of the Nationalities Intelligence Section and the one supervisor
from the Foreign Influence and Pro-CHICOM Unit of the Internal Security
Section along with his cases (492). (Note this Agent is not included in the IL.)
What is left of the Foreign Influence Unit could be consolidated with that of the
CPUSA Unit. The other supervisor from the pool of ll could be assigned to
the Special Coordination Unit of the Nationalities Intelligence Section.

This realignment would result in a considerable decline in personnel
within the Internal Security Section. However, a balancing of work load could
be accomplished through reassignment of the three-man Protest and Trotskyist
Groups Unit from the New Left Section to the Internal Security Section where it
was in the recent past. Further, as you are aware, a proposai is presently
being considered to reassign Antiriot Laws plus Explosives and Incendiary

Devices cases from the General Investigative Division to the Domestic Intelligence

H :

Division. While it is realized that logically these should be placed in the

New Left or Extremist Intelligence Section, to balance work load, they

could be considered for assignment to the Internal Security Section if proposal
is approved. The Research and New Left Sections would each be decreased
by one Special Agent Supervisor, the Extremist Intelligence Section by two.
The Nationalities Intelligence Section, excluding the Front Office, sia be
increased by one Special Agent Supervisor.

OBSERVATIONS:

Considerable time has been devoted to this phase of the inspection to
assess as accurately as possible manpower requirements of the various Units
and Sections. In addition to ticklers and file reviews your outgoing mail was
BO for one work week.

During the course of this mail survey covering a five -day work period,
715 pieces of mail or 143 pieces 1 day were generated and reviewed. Of
this number, 268 pieces or 37% were directed to the Front Office for review
and 497 pieces or 63% went directly to the field or other agencies without
Front Office review. This indicdes an average of 6 pieces of outgoing mail
per Agent are being prepared per work week, 55. 6% of the total pieces of
mail were of a routine nature, setting forth a minimum degree of supervision
and direction. 36.1% contained a moderate degree of supervision and 8.3%
contained a considerable degree of supervisory instruction or direction.

Of the average of six pieces of mail per Agent 3.3 pieces were of a

‘routine nature requiring minimal supervision ; 2.2 pieces moderate supervision

and .5 pieces (1/2 letter, etc.) considerable supervisory instruction or
direction per week.

- Examples of minimum supervisory content would be communications
permitting routine interview or informant payment (stamip), An example

_ of moderate supervisory content would be a letter to the Attorney General

with cover memo bringing AG up to date in a particular case. As example

of supervisory content of considerable degree would be instructions to interview
key witnesses on top priority cases setting out pertinent points to cover in the
interview or would furnish supervisory direction of a substantive investigation.

It is realized the above survey reveals only a small part of the
i Division's production; however, it gives some insight into the amount of
| actual supervision and direction being afforded the field as an overall
| consideration. It is not felt or implied that a "letter writing" program for the sake
|
|

of writing letters be instituted as obviously this does not relate to supervision.

It may indicate, however, among other things, the amount of intensity of positive
supervision peing afforded, as an over view and is being furnished for your
information as well as for mine.

The above analysis (manpower) reveals in your Division a need for
9 men on the McLek case, 2 for Chinese matters and one for Special
Coordination Unit. On a priority basis, inspection surveys reveal the manpower
is wailable as indicated. Itis felt your Chinese program must "get going now"
in view of impending developments.

In addition, our proposals will allow you to assign men permanently
to McLek and make other necessary shifts in manpower to get away from
"the temporary assignment basis you now have and which is disruptive to aii
Sections involved. It is also acknowledged some of the realignment
indicated has been proposed by your Division in studies made by you prior
to this inspection.

ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL |}
CLERICAL

An analysis was also made of adequacy of clerical personnel within your
Division and after careful study it was determined that a reduction of ll clerical
personnel is possible. This reduction could be made through attrition. The
reductions possible are graphically set forth in the chart below:

Internal Security and Research Branch:

of the individual units plus case load allocations. The justification for the above -
mentioned reductions is set forth below under the individual Unit and Sectim
designation:

. ‘pursuant to the above proposal that this Unit be absorbed by the

New Left Section

Special Investigations Unit - East

The surplus clerk presently workin g in this Unit is not
needed inasmuch as the four clerks permanently assigned to this Unit were
. adequately handling the work before he reported.

Special Investigations Unit - West

‘ It is felt three clerks could handle the work in this Unit
inasmuch as three clerks in Special Investigations Unit - East handle a
comparative work load, The East Unit has four clerks; however, one clerk
handles Sabotage cases and the West Unit does not handle these matters.

Subversive Individuals -~ New Left Unit

Although the caSe load iu this Unit is high the work is routine
and can be handled quickly. The Special Clerk (GS-6 Reviewer) handles much
of the reviewing of communications thus saving clerical time. This Unit is
operating with one less Agent who is on loan to the McLek case. Due toa
comparison of the clerical work load of the Subversive Individuals Unit in the
Internal Security Section it is felt this Unit could operate with one less clerk.

ESPIONAGE AND RACIAL INTELLIGENCE BRANCH
Espionage Section

Special Cases Unit -

It is felt based upon the case load of this Unit being handled
by clerks, that with the assistance of the stenographer, this Unit could
adequately operate and function with one less clerical employee .

Officials - New York Unit

It is felt the clerk-stenographer assigned to this Unit could
handle the IRONCLAD indices in addition to taking dictatim from supervisors.
This would leave the Unit with 2 stenographers for 3 supervisors and thereby
release the clerk who is presently handling the IRONCLAD indices.

Officials - WFO Unit

Based on the case load of this Unit, itis felt the clerk-steno-

This Unit presently has three regular cleiks and two Special

Based on the case load of this Unit it is recommended that
one clerk be released inasmuch as there does not appear to be sufficient work

ADDENDUM \

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D, BRENNAN: I have thoroughly studied
(CDB:djr 9/8/71) the Inspector's comments

regarding adequacy of
personnel, ‘both Agent and clerical, and have the following
observations to make;

I certainly recognize full well the need for
reorganizing and reallocating personnel to provide manpower
assistance to the Nationalities Intelligence Section which is
handling the McLek case. In fact, the proposed reorganization
of the Division as set forth in my memorandum of August 3,

1971, was based on the priority needs which arose from the McLek
case and which continue to be critical. As set forth in that
memorandum, manpower was to permanently be assigned to the
Nationalities Intelligence Section in order to avoid disruption
caused by handling this important case with temporary assignments.

In meeting the priority responsibilities in the
McLek case as well as in other cfitical areas, I am also
mindful that we do not have a surplus of manpower but are
+. undoubtedly faced with the supervision of more complex cases in
the security field with fewer Agents than at any other time in
the Bureau's history. Crises brought about by terroristic acts
_ of back extremists, Weathermen, antiwar activists, and other
extremists are increasing in intensity and from all indications
will continue to place heavy demands upon the Bureau. Likewise,
the potential of Chinese Communist eSpionage activity in this
country is readily apparent and the increased activity of
Soviet Agénts is a fact. These facts, coupled with special case
commitments, have stretched available manpower to the limit of
elasticity.

In making such manpower shifts, we must recognize that
there will be a weakening of the supervision of the area from
which the personnel are transferred and we must be prepared to
accept this, at least on a temporary basis, because in the long
run such weakening could be most harmful as well as embarrassing.

T For example, the Inspector has indicated that two
supervisors could be transferred out of the Extremist Intelligence
Section and, in addition, that Section should absorb all Klan

and white hate cases (now being handled by two men in another
Section). Actually, this means absorption of the work of four

men by the remaining men in the Section (18). Put another way,
the work load has been increased by almost 25 per cent.

20 3

HAW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 318 7

h : i

‘ As will be noted in the table set out hereinafter,
case loads are excesSive in very Sensitive|areas of the Bureau's
responsibilities, e.g., Soviet espionage and black and New
Left extremists who are daily escalating their revolutionary
activity in our streets.

The utilization of manpower on specials, such as
the current nine men on McLek, will receive extremely close
scrutiny and will be reallocated to these other pressing work
areaS aS soon aS possible as I do not believe the current
case loads allow adequate superviSion for any extended period
of time,

No one realizes the potential threat which the

Red Chinese pose to the security of this country better than

I. We must recognize, however, that there has been considerable

planning on the Bureau's part dating back to the 1950s when we

had first indications that the United States might recognize

j Red China, But the fact is that we have more important
priorities at this particular time evidenced by bombings,
assassinations, arsons and other terroristic acts daily
occurring by extremist elements within our investigative
responsibilities. We are faced right now with a very serious
internal security threat which demands immediate attention.
This does not minimize the Red Chinese threat at all but we
must recognize it is still a "potential" and until diplomatic
channels are opened and active eSpionage activity begins again
we must put "first things first." I believe affording one man
to that work area is the limit of our available resources at

- this time, :

With respect to the clerical reduction of 11 clerks,
which is to occur by attrition, I feel that a reduction of
this magnitude will definitely result in a hardship on the work
of the Division. I have repeatedly stressed that wherever
“possible Agents should be relieved of as many duties as possible
by competent clerical personnel, thus resulting in considerable
Savings of Agent manpower throughout the Division. A reduction
of the number of clerks, as recommended by the Inspector,
certainly will hamper our past streamlining efforts.

NW 55151 DoclId:32989638 Page 319 iaaue



“i \
; :

Set forth below, by Branch, are more specific
observations with respect to the Inspector|'s comments and
recommendations; however, in summary, I deSire to point out
that we cannot reassign manpower of the quantity involved for
an extended period of time and eliminate entirely by
attrition 11 clerks without such action having a deleterious
effect in certain areas of our operations, I am strongly
opposed to such lessening of our coverage in these areas but
if such recommendations are approved and ordered, I will do
my best to see that our responsibilities are fulfilled to the
maximum degree possible under the circumstances,

The following comments are:made concerning
reallocation of Agent personnel to top priorities regarding
the Internal Security and Research Branch. The Inspector
recommends seven supervisors be reallocated from this Branch
to other work areas. Based on day-to-day experience in
these work areas and having available end of August case
count figures, the following alternatives are recommended
to make seven supervisors available,

Research Section: The present stpervisur assigned
to the Ellsberg case is a talented writer experienced in
complicated research projects and preparation of research
papers, He is utilized full time on the Ellsberg case in
this capacity and on his own time continues to handle some
speeches and research matters, Research Section will make a
second supervisor available for the Ellsberg case and the
original supervisor will return to Research Section as soon as
his project is completed on Elisbers. This is predicated on
the assumption a replacement will be provided this Section for
SA_Ramey, who was transferred to another Division.

Internal Security Section: Will make four
supervisors available instead 6f five as recommended by the
Inspector.

‘This is predicated on experience and present case
load regarding the Subversive Individuals Unit primarily and
also the Security Informant Unit. August 31, 1971, case count
for the Subversive Individuals Unit is 2,663 cases, in addition,
523 cases were opened and 496 cases were closed during August
in this Unit. This would be an average case load of 666 cases

_ per Agent, not including the opening and closing mail flow.

The Security Informant Unit would be handling 904 cases,
averaging 452 cases when reduced to two supervisors.
Under the new case count system, these informant cases
are largely cases with mail in hand requiring attention
and close supervision because of funds being involved

as well as the general sensitivity of these cases, In
the event of sick or annual leave, one man could not
possibly keep mail current and work loads in other units
would, as a practical matter, preclude use of other
personnel to carry out the work, The supervisor retained
would reduce the case load in the Subversive Individuals
Unit to a more reasonable and practical 533 case load
average and also allow for a limited degree of flexibility
in theinformant matters from time to time as necessary.
This provides the seven men from this Branch. (This
includes one man from the New Left Section, as indicated.)

New Left Section: Will make one man available
as recommended.

Regarding reallocation of Agent personnel to
top priorities regarding the Espionage Branch, the
following comments are made:

Extremist Intelligence Section will make two
supervisors available and absorb the 559 Klan and White
Hate cases with no Agent personnel. It must be borne
in mind this, in effect, constitutes a net reduction of
four supervisors to black extremist matters at a time
when these activities are on a definite upswing, This
can be lived with on a short term emergency basis and
as manpower becomes available from the inevitable winddown
of McLek, appropriate recommendations will be considered
within the Division as to reallocation of that manpower
with this in mind consistent with overall Division needs
at that time.

7 Nationalities Intelligence Section will make two
men available as recommended, With regard to the two.

Units being reduced, it is pointed out that the Middle
and South American Unit is responsible for matters

relating to 32 countries, There are five Legal Attache
(Legat) Offices located in countries handled by the Unit
and each of these offices, except Mexico, covers more
than one country. The Nationality Unit is responsible
for matters relating to 101 countries. Eleven Legat
Offices are locatedin the area of responsibility of this
Unit and most of these Legat Offices cover more than one
country.

There is a high volume of material which is
received daily in these Units consisting of intelligence
information from other agencies and news media material.
All of this material must be reviewed in order that the
supervisors will be in position not only to handle inquiries
from any source relating to matters of Bureau responsibility
in the nationalities intelligence field but also to process
the high level intelligence (HILEV) items which are
received from Legats. The latter is a very heavy
responsibility since we recognize that if one high-level |
item goes to the President and he acts on it, and it
proves to be incorrect, not only the B
White House itseif might encounter sei
During month of August, of 106 HILEV itens received from
Legats, 51 were processed by the Nationality Unit and
34 by the Middle and South American Unit. Each of the
two units disseminated 30 HILEV items, Dissemination
of each HILEV item consumes approximately one hour of a
superyseon s time.

With regard to the Nationality Unit, which has the
lowest average case load per supervisor, other matters
handled in the Unit not reffected by caseload are:

(McLek case) but these reductions are not considered consistent
with adequate supervision nor offer necessary flexibility within
Sections to meet emergencies and specials as they arise when
viewed in terms of an extended period of time. It is expected
the McLek case, as with all specials, will ultimately wind down.
At that time and as personnel are available for reallocation,
appropriate recommendations will be made and considered within

time consistent with the overall needs of the Division.

Nationalities Intelligence Section is giving up two
men from present assignment, one to the Chinese Unit and one
to Special Coordination Unit. The latter is a non-case
assignment ‘and deletes one man from computation of average case
load in the Section which brings that Section more in line with
the present Division average of 335 cases per case supervisor
under the new rules for case count. This also results in one
less supervisor committed to case supervision and alters the
Division average per case supervisor to 341 cases.

It is recognized the Internal Security Section has a
high average case load per Agent, however, that Section has
less organization cases and proportionately more individual
matters requiring less supervisory attention than other Sections,

As to the Espionage and Extremist Intelligence
Branch clerical reduction recommendations, the following
comments are made.

Nationalities Intelligence will reduce one clerk
as recommended.
: In the Espionage Section there are 16 substantive
desk supervisors with 13 clerks actually performing the work
for these supervisors, a ratio of .81 per supervisor. To
reduce this number by four would result in the ratio .56 or
roughly 1/2 clerk per supervisor.

The Clerk-Stenographer position provides the
incumbent to perform clerical work only 20 per cent of her
time, The use of a Clerk-Stenographer in the Special Cases,
Officials - New York, and Officials - Washington Field Units
thus would not absorb the extra work placed on the remaining
clerks in these Units and such is not considered feasible.
The use of a Special Clerk now handling cases in lieu of a
Special Agent supervisor in the Satellite Unit to handle clerical
functions for a Supervisor would defeat the purpose of 7
establishing this position and would place an unfair burden
of responsibility on that Special Clerk who should be free to
concentrate on the supervision of her own cases.

In summary, it is felt that the present clerical
assignment is the minimum number necessary to handle the
voluminous, work associated with 5,575 cases currently

‘assigned to this Section.

The Racial Intelligence Section can absorb the
case load of 559 cases but will need a minimum of one clerk
to accompany these cases. This Section was not recommended
by the Inspector to reduce clerical complement and it is
not felt practical to absorb 559 cases and no clerical
personnel. This is particularly true when it is considered
no Agent personnel are being received with these cases,

I believe the above reductions, totalling three, are in
good faith with the Inspection Staff's and my own deSire to
obtain maximum utilization of personnel and continue an
efficient and practical operation, Further reduction would
merely result in Agents performing clerical functions, and with
the continued escalation in case loads and current special cases
being handled, I do not believe further reductions can be made
within the bounds of good personnel management aml best
utilization of clerical vs. Agent manpower.



: ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL
CLERICAL

The following comments are made concerning reduction
of clerical personnel in the Internal Security.and Research
Branch, :

Internal Security Section: In the past, it has been
necessary on a frequent basis to afford considerable clerical
-assistance from the Klan and White Hate Groups Unit to the
Subversive Individuals Unit because of the extremely heavy
clerical duties involved in the escalating case loads carried
in this Unit, coupled with 523 cases opened and 496 cases
closed during the past month, for example. It is necessary
and warranted to retain two of the three clerical personnel in
the disbanded Klan and White Hate Groups Unit for utilization
in the Subversive Individuals Unit. If this is not done, it
will result in an impractical clerical work load, with nowhere
to draw upon clerical help and result in supervisors being
additionally burdened with clerical functions, which they can
ill afford'to handle, This wouid also pe consistent and in iine
with the assignment of Agent personnel in this Unit detailed
previously and allow one clerk per Agent, which is adequate
but not excessive for the type of work involved.

New Left Section: It is believed the Special
Investigations - East and Special Investigations - West Units
can function with one less clerk each as recommended by the
“Inspector. It is not believed good management, however, to
reduce a clerk in the Subversive Individuals - New Left Unit.
With one Supervisor reduced, the clerical work remains the same
and retention of the clerk would allow one clerk per Agent,
which is adequate but not excessive for the type of work
involved. With the very heavy case loads in this Unit, coupled
with 768 cases opened and 776 cases closed within the past
month, for example, clerks are extremely busy. Reduction in
clerical staff merely means Agents will have to perform clerical
functions which iS uneconomical and hardly practical with the
work loads involved.

i

Bearing in mind Agent manpower reductions in the
Internal Security and Research Branch, it is believed the Branch
can operate with efficiency and in good faith with the
Inspection Staff and Divisions desire to use manpower to its
fullest and make the above three clerical reductions.

ADDENDUM a |
INSPECTOR E. 8. MLLER: Your comments ‘and proposals with
(ESM:bhg, 9 /oftis co respect to the reallocation of Agent

personnel within the Division appear
logical and are acceptable. However, exception must be made with
respect to clerical employees. :

You state it is necessary and warranted to retain 2 of the 3 clerical

personnel in the disbanded Klan and White Hate Groups Unit for utilization
in the Subversive Individuals Unit of the Internal Security Section. Based
upon figures available the case load within the Subversive Individuals Unit
approximates 2700 cases handled at present by three clerical employees
giving an average case load per clerk of approximately 900 cases. Retaining
one of the Klan clerks would result in an average case load per clerk of
675 cases which is not felt unreasonable or intolerable a burden. Further,
it is not felt that less than 1 clerk per Agent is too great a load for the Unit.

Turning now to the Espionage Section based on our survey it was felt
that 4 clerical positions could be voided through alirition, pased primariiy
on greater utilization of clerk-stenographers on clerical duties. You state
that,the clerk-stenographer position provides the incumbent to perform
clerical work only 20% of her time. At present there are 10 secretaries
and clerk-stenographers available for transcription of communications.

A survey of communications conducted during this inspection revealed that
the Espionage Section dispatched 121 pieces of correspondence during a —
5-day period, “which results in approximately 12 communications per
secretary or slightly over 2 communications per day per employee. This
does not indicate a great work load on the secretarial force and consequently

’ it is felt that clerk-stenographers could be freed for clerical functions where
necessary, In view of this it is felt that at least two clerical positions
could be dissolved through attrition within this section.

. With respect to the Extremist Intelligence Section, you indicate that
the case load of 559 cases can be absorbed but a minimum of one clerk
will be needed to handle these cases. Based upon case load figures available
should this clerk not be made available the average case load per clerk
within the Black Nationalist - East Unit would increase from approximately
470 to 660 cases. Black Nationalist - Central from approximately 715 to
940. Black Nationalist - South from approximately 780 to 1000, and the
Black Nationalist - West from approximately 210 to 350 cases per clerk.
Particular note should be made of the average case load per clerk increase

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 327 : B/E Geena



within the Black Nationalist - West Unit should the cases be absorbed there
with no added clerical employees. In view of the above it is felt that the

Racial Intelligence Section can absorb the additional cases”

clerk.

‘without an added

Based on the above it can be seen that at least 7 clerical positions could
be dissolved without an unreasonable burden being placed on the remaining.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

i “RE: PAYMENTS TO SECURITY INFORMANTS
. AND CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES :
Zi '
J) |
i 6; RE. S. MILLER: Present regulations allow for payments up
‘i to $400 with SAC authority on a COD basis
“fo individuals being developed as informants on security matters. (Manual
of Instructions, Section 107, page 14.) Once the individual is paid $400 and
it appears he will furnish information on a regular basis, recommendation
.could be made to Bureau to pay him on "regular basis. '' Such authorization
is through usage of FD-401, After the initial payments are approved, every
6 months an FD-401 is submitted requesting continuance, and, if approved,
is stamped "approved" at the Bureau and returned. (Manual of Instructions,
Section 107, page 15.)

in view of current Governiment-wide Coonomy move and the Bureau's -
own economy program, it is imperative that the field exercise great care and
serutiny in payments to informants to assure that payments on a "regular
basis" are fully justified and are not serving as an administrative crutch and
expedient in lieu.of payments under SAC authority.

. A survey has been made of 80 files of informants who are presently
being paid on a regular basis with respect to the date the informant was
approved as a PSI, the date approval was given to pay him on a regular basis,
and the amount paid the source under SAC authority before Bureau authority
was Sought to pay him on a regular basis.

In the following 34 informant files authority was granted to pay the
source on a regular basis before the field used the full amount that could
have been paid under SAC eee representing 42.5% of the total cases
reviewed:,

Those files marked with an asterisk indicate that only token amounts
had been paid under SAC authority ranging from $25 to less than $100.

This analysis would indicate SACs are abdicating authority to
approve paying sources the full amount allowed before seeking Bureau per-
mission to pay on a regular basis.

In the following 17 instances the Bureau approved the field's com-
munication seeking approval of an individual as a PSi in which the same corh-~
munication also asked approval to pay the source on a regular basis:

1384-19815
134- 19383
1384-20175
170-4295

In the following 19 cases the Bureau approved sources being paid on

1384-16923
134-21622
134-18818
134-18059

These 36 cases (17 + 19) represent 45% of those files reviewed and
indicate the field's undesirable practice of asking approval to pay sources on
a regular basis upon obtaining approval to develop the source as a PSI. It
does not appear that contacts with these individuals are over a sufficient
period of time to conclude the source is furnishing data on a regular basis
to justify paying him on a regular basis,

; -3-

A representative number of informant files were checked where the
full amount under SAC authority was not utilized and it was determined pay-
ments were over a 3.3 month period, for an average monthly payment of
$73.00 for each source. Subsequent to receiving approval to pay the source
on a regular basis each source received an average of $152 over the next
| 6-month period. It is concluded that if payments had continued for a longer
period under SAC authority before paying on a regular basis, an average of
approximately $80 less per month would have been expended in each case.
On an annual basis this would be $960. Estimating that as few as 38% of the
present number of Security Informants including New Left, Old Left (CPUSA),
Extremists, Klan and other White Hate Groups have been developed in the
past two years of the 1507 total number of Security Informants presently being
paid on a regular basis, this could be projected into $240,000 less having been -
spent each year on these sources.

Consequently, it appears every effort should be expended to insure
that payments to informants on a regular basis should be initiated only after
the source has furnished data on a continuing basis for at least 6 months and
after he has been paid the full amount under SAC authority on a COD basis
for value received. There should be no objection to the field's obtaining
Bureau authority to pay source up to another $400 SAC authority before paying
on a regular basis. Certainly, the request to approve an individual as a PSI
should not be coupled in the same communication with a request to pay that
individual on a regular basis. (Of course, in exceptional and unusual cases
facts could warrant conclusion that some sources could be paid on a regular
basis in a shorter period of time.) This will also help to preclude informant's
obvious conclusion that he is being paid on a salary basis because of the
similar amounts paid to him each month. :

In addition, all irae the initial payments on
a regular basis to security informants/Be ited through Mr. Tolson's Office
for review and approval.

It is felt a wider usage of payments under SAC authority to security
informants, will in the long run, serve to substantially reduce total payments
. to them and further implement efforts to curtail costs in accordance with the
Director's and President's recent directives on economy.

Comments of Assistant Director requested,

2g

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 332



Assistant Director C. D. oecoren Security and extremist
(JAS: ebe 9/8/71) informants are essential

to the Bureau's investi-
gative responsibilities. They operate largely in controversial
areas of old line and new left revolutionary organizations and
individuals as well as in the volatile fields of black and white
extremism and racial dissension. They are fraught with controversy
and potential for embarrassment to the Bureau, Extended experience
has taught us the absolute necessity for tight, effective, cen-
tralized control of these informants by SOG.

Kn

7 Fundamentally, whether an informant is paid under SAC
authority or on a regular basis by SOG the same standards of
justification are to be applied. The distinguishing element is the
flexibility of on-the-scene, spot payment authority available to
the SAC on a daily basis without the formality of time-consuming
correspondence with Bureau headquarters. Money is paid in both
situations on a c.o.d basis and full value must be received before
nayments are made. Initial payments to a developing informant under
SAC authority, usually made on an expedient emergency basis, are
not reviewed and evaluated at the SOG. The judgment of the SAC
prevails. Generally the Bureau approves payments on a regular
basis only when emergency and exceptional local conditions no
longer prevail, when the informant is active, productive and gives
promise of continuing to be so.

ian Should the currently authorized initial SAC-authorized
$400 be expended rapidly-~as is frequently the case--there is no
objection to the field's obtaining Bureau authority to pay a
second $400 to an informant under SAC authority. This does
require justification through submission of full facts in the
matter for SOG judgment, similar to the justification required
each six months for informants paid on a regular basis,

Authorization for SAC authority to permit such payments
up to six months’ before the field requests regular payments from
the Bureau as suggested by the Inspector, could dilute both the
central and consistent control of payments at the Bureau and could
cause an increase in paper work required to implement the
procedure. SAC authority currently has no fixed time limit for
expenditures and in many cases this authorization could be

NW_55151_ _D: H Bf ge iam



expended before the termination of a six-month development
period thus requiring additional paper work in the field
and resultant supervisory work at the Bureau.

It is extremely difficult to draw meaningful
conclusions concerning any savings between payments under
SAC authority and costs accrued under delayed SOG approval
of payments on a regular basis. The informant while operating
under SAC authority is in a developmental stage. It can be
expected that at any given point in his development whether
-he continues on SAC authority or is approved for reguiar
payments, expenditures to him will increase. It is the natural
and practical order of informant development.

The sooner a developing security or extremist
informant can be brought under SOG control the more effective
and consistent becomes his supervision. The SAC remains
accountable, of course, for the informant's handling, the
validity of his expenditures, and the worth of his information.
Additional supervision, based on broad field needs and applied
with consistency to the over-all policies of the Bureau,
necessarily is furnished by SOG supervisors and officials.

This amounts to far more effective field-wide supervision of
these sensitive matters.

Strict economy continues to be the rule in Bureau
‘supervision of security and extremist informants, During the
period 4/1/70 through 6/70 for example as a result of reviewing
regular payments to informants $4392 was saved. During the
period 1/1/71 through 3/1/71 $5156 was saved. More recently
on 8/20/71 a letter to all offices instructed them to cut back
five per cent in their total payments to security and extremist
informants~-a projected saving of $129,000.

It is respectfully submitted that, in view of the
over-all sensitivity of security and extremist informants, current
procedures allowing for initial payments under SAC authority with
a shift to Bureau approval of payments on a regular basis as the
informant progresses and develops productivity, provide the most

.effective and consistent field-wide supervision for the over~all
needs of the Bureau. .

HW_55151__DocId:32989638 Page 334



While there is no objection to the Inspector's
suggestion that all communications approving initial payments
on a regular basis to these informants be routed through
Mr.. Tolson's office for review and approval it must be pointed
out, of course, that this creates a substantial increase in the
preparation and review of related correspondence, not previously
required. In view of this forseeable increase in work load,
it is respectfully suggested that we continue to handle initial
payment correspondence under existing regulations.

information. The primary reason for such an index is -to
have a central repository containing the number and
identities of informants. This information is readily
accessible. Informal discussions have been held in the
past concerning feasibility of computerizing the Security
Informant Index as well as the Extremist Informant Index.
During course of these discussions, there were two prime
considerations; namely, the ready accessibility of
information on the indexes as well as the saving of
manpower and cost to the Bureau. Previous discussions

did not result in a positive recommendation to computerizing
the above indexes. It is noted that the present indexes
are serving the Bureau's purpose. In order to insure that
all avenues of savings are considered, the Inspector's
suggestion will be carried out. Surveys and conferences
with our cxpert personnel in the -awtomatie data processing
field will be conducted to determine if such an operation
is feasible, practical and economical, keeping in mind
the accessibility of the information and the security of
informants. It is proposed, therefore, that this
suggestion be immediately acted upon.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D, BRENNAN I agree that it would
(JAS:cb - 9/7/71) be desirable to carry

a . out this suggestion.
I will follow this matter closely to determine if such an
operation is feasible.

SUPERVISION AND CONTROL OF SECURITY INFORMANT
DEVELOPMENT AND COVERAGE BY INTERNAL SECURITY
AND NEW LEFT SECTIONS

lector E.S. MILLER: At the time of the last inspection a

§ suggestion was submitted (pages 227 -
233) pointing out advantages in implementation of a program in this area of
operation which would make our approach to both above types of informants
and Extremist (Racial) informants uniform, You agreed to implement for

one year; however, your subsequent efforts to initiate the program were lost
in a "security of transmitting problem, "

Your Extremist Intelligence Section solved the same problem by having
the fieid send their infurmaut reports to the Bureau by sccure teletype and
it is understood that method of handling is satisfactory. The overall
Extremist Informant Program also appears productive.

It is recommended that you again favorably consider the prior suggestion
and tailor implementation after its counterpart in the Extremist Section.
Administration of such a program should be more efficiently handled now
since you have reinstituted handling of, these informants by a Security
Informant Unit.

Comments of Assistant Director Brennan requested.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D, BRENNAN: This suggestion will be
{ (JAS;cb - 8/27/71) 7 favorably considered.

A careful analysis will
; be conducted to tailor the suggestion to the needs of the
i Sections affected, keeping uniformity in mind. This matter
will be closely followed by me.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM
BLACK NATIONALIST PHOTOGRAPH ALBUM

ye Uren: E. “Ss. MILLER: The Black Nationalist Photograph Album
(BNPA) was approved and established

1968 and at this time contains the photograph and biographical
data of 472 black extremists who travel extensively in this
country and abroad. Each field office plus Legal Attaches,
Ottawa and Mexico City, maintain this Album to assist in coverage
of movement of black extremist individuals in the United States,
Canada, and Mexico. The Album appears to be an excelient
investigative aid by making immediately available photograph
and background data on individuals traveling from one Division
to another or out of the country whose activities must be
followed.

A review of files discloses at least 10 individuals
who are included in the BNPA traveled to Paris in the recent
past. It is noted a favorite route of Black Panthers traveling
to Algeria is through Paris. In view of the increased activity
on the part of the Cleaver Faction of the Black Panther Party,
it can be assumed that travel of individuals affiliated with the
Cleaver Faction to and from Cleaver's headquarters in Algeria
— ena.
will continue or increase. In view of these travels, the
Legal Attache, Paris, could utilize the BNPA to facilitate
expedite coverage of these extremists while in France.

A review of the BNPA itself reveals that some of the
photographs attached to the FD-432 in this file do not have the
names of the individuals photographed on the back of the photo-
graph. These photographs should have the individual's name on
the back in the event the Photographs become detached from the

FD-432.
RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. That Legat, Paris, be provided with a copy of the
BNPA. .

2. If a further pattern of travel develops into an
area covered by another Legal Attache, consideration should
then be given to making available a copy of the BNPA to that
Legal Attache.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

RE: YOUNG SOCIALIST ALLIANCE
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST (TROTSKYIST)

4 . !
PY,
SIAL 8S, MILLER: From a review of the matters being

handled by the New Left Section, it is
evident that the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), the youth group of the
Socialist Workers Party (SWP), is the fastest growing subversive youth
group in this country. In August, 1970, membership was estimated to be
100. During the SWP convention which was held in August, 1971, it was
determined that YSA membership had grown to 1500 members.

It is noted YSA played an important role in the activities of the
National Peace Action Coalition | during the April - May, 1971, antiwar
demonstrations in Washington, D. C.

YSA has numerous chapters throughout the United States, primarily
on campuses. In addition, the Student Mobilization Committee to End the
War in Vietnam (SMC) has chapters on many campuses. The SMC is
nothing more than a front group for the YSA and is dominated and controlled
by YSA,

YSA claims it had recruited 450 new members into its ranks during
the Spring of 1971.

Its leaders have called for aggressive YSA recruiting among colleges
this fall and have set a goal of at least doubling their present membership.

YSA leaders have called for student strikes on campuses this fall
in order to close them down and attempt to organize them for antiwar work.

: The SWP is attempting to place its candidates on ballots in 32 states
and YSA is being called on to assist in a vigorous election campaign. SWP
and YSA plan to use this campaign as a means of recruiting new members
to their ranks, It is noted YSA is planning to hold its national convention
in Houston, Texas, late this fall.

In view of the above and because of existing criteria which was
approved by the Department that membership in YS'A is sufficient to place
an individual on the Security Index, the New Left Section should consider
issuing instructions to the field that sufficient effort be expended on their
investigations of YSA activities to insure that all YSA members are
identified and investigated for possible inclusion in the Security Index.

Comments of Section Chief Shackelford and Assistant Director
Brennan requested.

SECTION CHIEF R. L, ew) I fully concur with the
Inspector's observations

concerning this matter, We.are carefully analyzing the informant

reports which are now being received concerning the results of

the Socialist, Workers Party (SWP) National Convention and Young

Socialist Alliance (YSA) Educational Conference which was held

8/8-15/71. Considerable valuable information has been developed

concerning YSA's future plans and activities, including its plans
sw. for an intensive reeruiting campaign this fall, In addition,

YSA is continuing to play an extremely important role in the

activities of the National Peace Action Coalition (NPAC) and

continues to dominate and control the nation-wide activities

of the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in

Vietnam. (SNC).

With appropriate approval, we will furnish all field
offices with the latest known plans and activities of YSA and
will instruct them to vigorously pursue their investigations of
the YSA and to insure all YSA members are identified and,
thereafter, to submit appropriate recommendations for placing
their names in the Security Index pursuant to existing Bureau

RE: AUTOMATION OF INTELLIGENCE DATA
RE NEW LEFT AND EXTREMIST INDIVIDUALS

A
if Zh E.S. MILLER: The Espionage Sectim in close cooperation with

f the Voucher Statistical Section - Administrative
iVision, has designed and implemented an automated system known as the Soviet
Information Collation System. It is essentially a repository of pertinent data on
Soviet officials assigned to the U. S. Through the fast and easy manipulation of
this data by the computer, outputs arranged by important elements of information
can be readily and reliably obtained for Bureau use or dissemination to outside
agencies. The Espionage Section attests to the fact it has "streamlined our
operations, promoted uniformity and assured the highest level of accuracy. At
the same time, it has resulted in a substantial savings in time, money and man-
power, both in the field and at SOG." :

It would seem reasonable a similar repository of information could be
collected regarding New Left and Extremist individuals. This would parallel
the SICS operation.

Various reports could be selected from this data such as an alphabetical
listing of Key Activist, New Left, and Extremist individuals. Other alternatives
would include listings by phone number according to geographical areas, listings
by addresses according to geographical areas, or listings by demonstrations in
which certain individuals have participated. Summary reports or listings, if
required for dissemination to the field offices or other interested agencies, could
be efficiently prepared under such a system. There are numerous other alternativ:
that come to mind; however, any consideration for such a program must clearly
take into account the need and benefit for such automation.

under Automatic Data

Processing (ADP), 5-Q, automatic data banks are utilized
extensively by the Extremist Intelligence and New Left Sections
in connection with the Computerized Telephone Number File
(CINF). CINF lists telephone numbers known to be utilized by
black, New Left and other ethnic extremist groups and individuals.
Telephone numbers included in CTINF are listed according to
geographic areas, In addition, a special project utilizing ADP
is being operated in connection with the EASTCON case. In this
EASTCON project, ADP analyses of telephone calls between EASTCON

subjects are made and also new subjects are identified through
AnD analyses of FASTCaN toll galle .

At present, over 12,700 individuals making up the
Security Index (SI) have been incorporated into the Bureau's
computerized data bank and this data is available to all offices
through ADP. In connection with this ADP, SI project, identifying
data concerning each subject, as well as his residence and
business addresses, are included therein along with other pertinent
items such as his organizational affiliation. Over 20 separate
print-~outs are prepared monthly for administrative and investi-
gative use of the Domestic Intelligence Division and the field.

The facilities of NCIC have also been utilized to
aid our investigations of New Left and extremist individuals.
“Stop Index" programs for Bureau use only at NCIC have been
devised which furnish notice of any police inquiry concerning
missing Venceremos Brigade subjects and all Priority I, SI
subjects who are extremists, unless they are already included in
the NCIC Wanted Persons File.

As indicated, much effort has been made to avail our-
‘selves of opportunities provided by ADP. The Inspector's
suggestion that further effort be made to expand our use of ADP
facilities, taking into consideration the need and benefit for
such automation, appears to have merit; this will be studied and
appropriate recommendations made as to its adaptability.

PREPARATION OF INTERVIEW REPORTS (FD-302)

| internal security - nationalistic tendencies matters,

| - security informants, and racial matters, it was noted that

“In this “connection the Nanual of Rui 3 and

i i of
’ ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNAN, s~ The following are my
MY comments requested in

d inspector's Suggestion Memorandum entitled "Preparation of
oF Interview Reports (FD-302) in Security Type Investigations:"
/ Inspector notes at outset that from a review of the
/ FBI Handbook, Manual of Rules and Regulations and Manual of

Instructions in regard to the various types of security
investigations, no mention is made that information which may
be the subject of later testimony in judicial or administrative
type hearings must be made a matter of record on an interview
report (FD-302). Inspector does recognize that the Manual of
Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 4, page 4a, makes
reference to the preparation of interview reports in security
type cases.

In Section 4, Part II of the Manual of Rules and
Regulations, which Section pertains to Communications, there
is a subheading entitled "Reporting Information That May
Become Testimony," which is covered on pages 4 and 4a. It
is specifically stated on page 4, paragraphs 2b and c, that
FD-302s should be used when information is obtained which may
be the subject of testimony. At the very top of page 4a, a
specific reference is made to security-type cases and the use
of an FD-302 in these cases. The requirement for using an
FD-302 is further reiterated in paragraph 6 on page 4a.

Part I of the Handbook has a section commencing on
. page 36, item 48, entitled "Reporting Information That May
Become Testimony."' This is the counterpart to the Manual of
Rules and Regulations provisions cited immediately above.
The requirement for the use of an FD-302 is enunciated in iten
number 48.

: Of particular significance is the fact that both ‘the
Manual of Rules and Regulations and the Handbook provide in
their respective Indices for the requirements discussed above.
In the Manual, the material is indexed under "Reporting
information that may’ become testimony" as well as under
"Testimony-~reporting information that may become." The
Handbook index has the same two references. It is therefore
obvious that the requirements for the use of an FD-302 are
logically and easily retrievable by reference to either or both
the Manual and Handbook.

ce o

A cursory spot check of some criminal violations in
the Manual of Instructions notes that there is no specific
mention made for some violations and it is quite likely that
the specific requirement for use of an FD-302 is not spelled
out for each of the many, many criminal violations covered in
the various sections of the Manual of Instructions. The
requirement is covered in the Manual of Rules and Regulations
and the Handbook as are many other requirements which pertain
to the Bureau's work generally. A primary function of the
Manual of Rules and Regulations is to have in one place general
requirements that are applicable across the board in our work.
The Section relating to Communications referred to above is a
good example. :

It was observed by the Inspector that "quite possibly
the seeming reluctance on the part of investigative agents
handling security matters to prepare FD-302's may be due to
the lack of mention of this in the Manual and Handbook
provisions dealing with security investigations." It is
respectfully observed that we have not noted any "seeming
reluctance" on the part of investigative Agents handling work
in the security field. We have found that the requirements
for the use of an FD-302 are being generally complied with and
when any shortcomings might be noted they are dealt with on
an individual case basis. In short, we have had no problems
in this area of our operations. It may be that the Inspector's
observations are based on noting rather few FD-302s in security
reports as compared with reports in the criminal field. If
this be the case, it is observed that by and large our
obtaining of information in the security field is of an
intelligence nature with prosecutable situations being generally
the exception. In other words, situations where information
might become testimony are rather limited.

A further aspect of the Inspector's Suggestion
Memorandum relates to the preparation of FD-302s when obtaining
information from security informants. In this respect it is
observed that a great many of our security informants prepare
written reports which are firsthand accounts and thus preferable
to FD-302s which are secondhand accounts. Thus, the informants'
reports are even more valuable than FD-302s and are available
‘Lor the same purpose as are the FD-302s. When an informant
furnishes information orally which is not backed up by a written
report from the informant and the information may become a
matter of testimony, the Agent is under the same requirement to
execute an FD-302. We have not observed any failings to speak
of in this regard.

SPECTOR E, S, MILLER: The primary intent of this suggestion was to point
F.Hanlon:wmj 8/27/71) up a possible problem developing as 2 result of
the increased number of criminal violations
being encountered by Special Agents handling security work, An excellent
illustration of this can be found in case captioned "Peoples Coalition for Peace
and Justice; IS -Miscellaneous, " Bufile 100-459771. In WFO report of SA James F.
Whalen dated 5/7/71, serial 423, page 5, is found a narrative of events at a
* demonstration on November 21, 1970, at New York, This information was not
placed on an FD -302 and became an issue at a preliminary hearing. As the
contents of this report were not on FD-302s it was necessary to excise pertinent
portions of the report and considerable issue of this was made at the preliminary
hearing. A further indication of this most necessary indoctrination of security
Agents in the use of FD-302s can be found in the EASTCON case. Your attention
is invited to an airtel under that caption dated 8/25/71 calling for an in-depth
interview of a key witness. In this airtel the supervisor felt it necessary to
instruct that the results of this interview be placed on an FD -302,

In light of the above, itis felt yorshould take whatever
action deemed necessary to bring to the attention of Special Agents working
security matters the necessity of placing information which could be testimony
on FD -302s, It is felt the matter should definitely be highlighted and then followed
in the individual cases.

Comments of Assistant Director Brennan are requested.

EAST COAST CONSPIRACY

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

C. D. BRENNAN The East Coast Conspiracy: is |
a loosely knit movement com- . |

posed primarily of Catholic priests and nuns, teachers, students i

and former students and others who have manifested opposition to }

the Vietnam war by acts of violence against Government agencies

and private corporations identified as defense contractors. The

main thrust of their efforts has been vandalism of draft boards.

The Philadelphia Office developed an informant in

Lewisburg Penitentiary who was a confidant of Philip Berrigan,

others associated with the movement.

: Information contained in the letters and, obtained as a
result of personal contacts of the ‘informant produced information
showing this group intended to call attention to their anti-Vietnam

_ war position by blowing up the underground heating and electrical
systems servicing Government buildings in Washington, D. C., and
to kidnap a high Government official, Dr. Henry A. Kissinger,
Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, was
mentioned as a possible victim. The proposed target date for
these actions was February 22, 1971.

Following the arrest on September 6, 1970, of several
individuals associated with this movement for the destruction of
draft board records in Rochester, New York, which action included
extensive vandalism to the office of the U.S, Attorney as well as
our Rochester Resident Agency, the informant learned that the
leading activists in the movement intended to expand their
activities to include attacks against FBI offices. Informant also
learned from McAlister that the group intended to undertake some
sabotage-type action at Picatinny Arsenal, Dover, New Jersey, on
an undisclosed date. :

East Coast Conspiracy

Because of the basic responsibility of this Division
for investigations involving subversive antiwar groups, overall
responsibility for this investigation was assumed by memorandum
dated September 10, 1970. This, of course, did not include
individual Selective Service violations existing in various
stages of prosecution or subsequent substantive violations in
which affiliates of this group were suspected of being involved.

This investigation has been specifically targeted to
two areas of prosecutive potential. First, to develop sufficient
evidence to prosecute leadership of this broad conspiracy to
impede the Government's functioning and conduct of the Vietnam
war, In this vein, a comprehensive review of pertinent material
discloses 16 related incidents from October 27, 1967, at Baltimore,
Maryland, to Rochester, New York, on September 6, 1970. Of 97
individuals involved in 16 incidents during this period, 25
persons have been established as being involved in three or more
of these incidents. This particular phase of the investigation
is most detailed and complex; however, in terms ot tar-reaching
damage to the movement, it is most significant. For example,
we have set up an éxtensive Automatic Data Processing (ADP)
project which resulted in a print-out showing over 300 telephone
calls of interest between telephone numbers utilized by these
conspirators and which corroborate information from the informant
regarding calls he received from principal conspirators.”

Second, we are developing sufficient evidence to prosecute
the perpetrators of the plots to kidnap Presidential advisor
- Henry A, Kissinger and to blow up the tunnels which contain steam
and electrical conduits between Government buildings in Washington, D.C.

Because of publicity given the plots to kidnap Kissinger

and to blow up the tunnels in Washington, D. C., it is imperative
this phase of the investigation be vigorously pressed toward
prosecutive action. Consistent with this objective the Federal
Grand Jury has been hearing evidence in this matter since December 18,
1970, and according to, Departmental attorney Guy L. i

“to C, D, Brennan dated 9/10/70, It is presently supervised by
SuveryvisorJanes_—.AicGuire and overall supervision afforded by
Unit Supervisor Fred B. Griffith.

It is acknowledged that it was necessary to issue
instructions to the field cautioning them about conducting extensive
background investigations on members close to this conspiracy
prior to the presentation of facts of this case to the Grand Jury

“to preclude the possibility of compromising an informant. However,
the following suggested investigative action is being set forth for
your consideration inasmuch as it is of paramount importance that
you continue to press this matter vigorously. These suggestions
are not to be considered as all inclusive, but are being set forth
for your consideration and appropriate action:

1. You should insure that the field aggressively
intensifies its investigation of this conspiracy including detailed
comprehensive background investigations on all subjects both
directly and indirectly associated with the ECCSL, It should be
emphasized, however, that utmost discretion and good judgment should
be exercised in the conduct of investigations of the principal
conspirators so that unfounded charges of harrassment cannot be
leveled against the Bureau.

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION INSPECTION
1/18/71
JAA/EFF :maz

-+-



During the conduct of these background investi~
gations the field should be particularly alert to every
potential opportunity for developing member informants in
not only the ECCSL but also in other sympathetic and
splinter groups which develop or spin off from the vortex
of this group.

It is noted that you have pointed out elsewhere
in this report that 97 individuals have been involved
in 16 separate and distinct organized incidents and attacks
on Government agencies and private corporations. Twenty~
five persons were involved in three or more such incidents.

2. The field should be appropriately instructed
to keep the Bureau fully advised of all demonstrations,
vigils, harrassment tactics, etc., conducted by sympathetic
groups and followers of the ECCSL Such vigils and demon-
strations should be afforded sufficient appropriate coverage
to develop identities and background of leading activists
and sponsors of such sympathetic activities.

During these background investigations, particular
emphasis should be placed on developing sources of funds
and financing of the principal conspirators. A review of
this file noted that the subjects appear to travel frequently,
make numerous long-distance phone calls, rent cars, etc.,
yet outwardly, appear to have limited sources of income.

3. The field should be alerted to the distinct
possibility that other groups similar to the ECCSL are
formed as a result of the indictments returned in this
matter. Field offices should also be alerted to other
retaliatory actions by sympathetic groups attempting a
to-capitalize on the "persecution" theory thereby
exploiting the recent indictments as a sympathetic
rallying point for more conspiratorial activities.

“The two principal informants in this operation
have received the "Order of Lenin," with the |title
tnero of Soviet Labor" from the Soviets. This is the
highest award given civilians by the Soviet Union and was
given our sources for their "invaluable contribution to the
, international communist movement,"

Continued high-level penetration of the CPUSA
represents a sustained major accomplishment. At the time
of the last inspection, we had 11 informants who were
officially members of the CPUSA National Committee. At
the present time, this overall number remains the same,
but we have exchanged two informants to give us a better
geographical breakdown. In addition, we have another
informant who is an ex officio member of the National
Committee because of the sensitive nature of his Party
assignments. This latter source is also a member of the
Political Committee which, in effect, runs the Party.
This top-level coverage is responsible for furnishing
information regarding policy-making matters on a day-to-day
basis as they occur.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS
PROTEST AND TROTSKYIST GROUPS UNIT

This unit was formerly known as the Protest Groups
and International New Left Unit. As of December 16, 1970, a
separate International New Left Unit was organized which took over
investigations pertaining to this particular work. Since the
last inspection, the intensified investigation of cases has
continued to produce positive results.

: Selective supervision has enabled us to have advance
knowledge of New Left leaders, conferences, and demonstrations.
Through this advance knowledge, we have been able. to furnish the
White House and other interested Government agencies information
on a daily basis regarding pertinent activities of individuals
and groups of interest to us. We have disseminated voluminous
letterhead memoranda, reports, and teletypes concerning plans of
leaders of these groups which were most timely, particularly where |
violence was a possibility. On the basis of material furnished
by this unit, two Current Intelligence Analysis (CINAL) were

published pertaining to the Student Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam (SMC) and the New Mobilization Committee

to End the War in Vietnam (NMC).

These investigations furnished complete coverage of the
major antiwar demonstrations in May and October, 1970, as well as
sectional and national meetings at which plans for these demon-
strations were formulated. This coverage afforded detailed

. knowledge of the major shift in the antiwar movement, and the
view of its leadership pertaining to the degree and amount of
militant tactics to be employed. We were able to follow closely
the emergence of the National Coalition Against War, Racism, and
Repression (NCAWRR) out of the once powerful NMC and the attempts
of the Trotskyist groups to exercise greater influence within -the
antiwar movement through the formation of the National Peace Action
Council (NPAC). The NCAWRR has proposed a national action for
May, 1971, whereby efforts will be made to close down Washington,
D. C., by the use of militant tactics. The NPAC plans national
demonstrations in April, 1971, which may verywell undermine the
impact of the NCAWRR action.

blame oR Sime vesponsibility of the Bureau and the

intelligence community is to develop intelligence relating
to efforts of foreign governments, organizations, and
individuals to influence, direct, or dominate the New

Left movement in the U.S. In this regard, over the years,
there have been a number of international-type conferences
often sponsored by international front-type groups frequently
under the direction or control of the Soviet Union.

Late last summer this Bureau received information
that the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam (SCV), an organiza-
tion established in 1967 which is controlled by the Soviet
dominated World Council for Peace, intended to hold a World
Conference on Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in Stockholm,

Sweden, 11/28-30/70, As the SCV, since its inception, has

KLAN AND WHITE HATE GROUP UNIT 4-5

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Membership in Klan-type organizaticns and other
white hate groups has experienced a continuous decline for
the past four years. The Klan reached a post-World War II
membership high of approximately 14,000 in 1966. From that
point on, there has been a continuing decline in membership.
At the present time, we have 18 Klan organizations made up of
225 Klaverns (units). There are, of course, in addition to
‘the membership, many thousands of sympathizers. Investigation
in the white extremist field for organizations other than the
Klan is centered around the Minutemen, the National States
Rights Party (NSRP), and the National Socialist White People's
Party (NSWPP).. There are numerous other small groups which
likewise fall within this category. This reduction in Klan
and other white hate group membership is attributable to the
continuous attention given these investigations by then Seat of
Government and the field, with specific attention given to: hard-.
hitting investigations. counterintelligence programs directed
at them, and penetration of these groups at all levels by our
racial informants.

The year 1970 showed a continuing decline in the
membership and effectiveness of the various Klan and white
hate groups throughout the U.S. As of January, 1970, Klan
membership totaled approximately 5,300. Our present figures
indicate that Klan membership now totals approximately 4,300.
The largest Klan group is the United Klans of America, Inc.,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (UKA) under the direction of
Imperial Wizard Robert M..Shelton.. The membership of this
group in January, 1970, was approximately 4,100 whereas it
now numbers 3,500 members, or approximately 80% of the member-
ship of all Klan organizations. These recent figures
represent an approximate decrease in overall Klan membership
of 17% and 15% decrease in UKA membership. Membership in
white hate organizations other than the Klan which has always
been relatively smaller membership-wise has likewise experienced
a relatively similar decline.

: With the arrest of Robert DePugh,,.National_ Coordinator
of the Minutemen, in July, 1969, and his subsequent conviction

for Federal Firearms Act violation and incarceration, this group

has virtually fallen apart and there is practically

no organized activity. Membership is approximately
180, but individuals remain violence prone.

The National States Rights Party under the
direction of J. B. Stoner is likewise experiencing
difficulty in increasing either membership or activity
and -consequently is planning to move its headquarters
from Savannah, Georgia, to Atlanta, Georgia. In the
meantime this organization continues to grind out anti-
Negro and anti-Jewish propaganda in crude fashion in
their publications and speeches. Membership is
approximately 150.

The National Socialist White People's Party
(NSWPP) (formerly the American Nazi Party) has-its
headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, which is the
center for its activities. There is moderate activity
in Los Angeles and Chicago. Recenfy a serious split in the
ieadership has occurred as a rosult of counterintelligence
action taken on the part of the Bureau through use of racial
informants. Here again membership continues to decline.
They appear to be content with publishing a variety
of anti-Negro, anti-Jewish publications and preparing
their "White Power" telephone messages. Membership is
approximately 125. :

The above is set forth to show the general
accomplishments made by this Unit in the Klan and white
hate field during the past year. Some specific examples
of accomplishments are hereafter set forth;

In February, 1970, we furnished information to
the White House, the Army, Secret Service, Internal Revenue
Service, the Internal Security and Civil Rights Divisions
of the Department and the Inter-Division Information Unit,
which we received from racial informants of our Tampa
Division who advised that the United Florida KKK had
printed 15,000 protest letters which were being made
available to the public for mailing to President Nixon
in connection with school desegregation. We also furnished
a copy of the actual protest letter for the benefit of
the White House and other agencies.

On February 20, 1970, Robert DePugh, National

In March, 1970, we again advised the White House,
the Attorney General, the Army, Secret Service, Internal
Revenue Service, the Internal Security and Civil Rights Division
of the Department and the Inter~Division Information Unit,
of information learned from racial informants of our Mobile
Division relative to another letter-which was made available
to the public by the UKA for mailing to President Nixon as
a protest in connection with school desegregation in Alabama.
This was similar to the information previously furnished
relative to the other letter which was made available to the
public by the United Florida KKK, A copy of this letter was
also furrished to the White House, the Attorney General,
Secret Service, the Internal Security and Civil Rights
Divisionsof the Department and the Inter-Division Information
Unit.

In July, 1970, as a result of our investigation,
two individuals associated with a paramilitary right wing
group called "The Raiders," Ferri, Loyd Hayes and Kenneth, Ray.
McMaster, were arrested by Bureau dégents in connection with Ms
the bombing of 36 school busses at Longview, Texas, on July 4,
1970. A Federal court had ordered bussing in connection with
school integration. A special Federal Grand Jury at Tyler,
Texas, on July 23, 1970, returned a true bill of indi&iment:
charging the- two individuals: on two counts; count one, viola-
tion of Title 18, U.S, Code, Section 241 (Civil Rights Act,
1964), and count two, violation of Title 18, U.S. Code,

S. 1509 (Obstruction of Court Order). These two individuals
had also been found to have placed "flashlight bombs" in two
Negro residential areas. Both these individuals were held in
lieu of $125,000 bond each; later reduced to $25,000 each.
They are still awaiting trial.

In July, 1970, as a. result of a counterintelligence
technique utilized in connection with the counterintelligence
program directed at the Klan, Exalted Cyclops, Thomas,,Stipes,
of Mascot Klavern 778), Mascot, Tennessee, was eliminated from
€his top position and Subsequently banished from the UKA.

AS a result of this counterintelligence action, membership in
this Klavern has fallen off appreciably. .-

On 9-25-70 Robert DePugh was found guilty in U.S.
District Court, Albuquerque, New Mexico, under Federal Firearms
Act for possession of various destructive devices at the
time of his arrest in New Mexico. He received a ten-year
sentence on 10-9~70 on these charges. He is presently
serving his sentence at the U.S; Penitentiary, Leavenworth,
Kansas.

In September, 1970, as a result of counterintelligence
action taken, two of our racial informants in the Little Rock
Division were instrumental in successfully causing the
defeat of a Klansman who was running for_Sheriff in Jefferson.

discreetly spread the truth through the Negro community that
Calvert was actually an active Klansman. As a result of this

pandas Calvert was overwhelmingly defeated,

In September, 1970, we advised the President, the
Vice President and the Attorney General of current information
concerning Klan activity in the-U.S.; the decline in Klan
membership; techniques the Klan was instituting to attempt
to increase its income and the fact that a black box,
resembling a coffin, was being shipped to the President by
@ group called “united Parents of Duval County." Florida. |
This was being sent to the President in connection with a
protest against school integration in Jacksonville, Florida.
In furnishing this information, we advised that the individual
who paid for the shipping was identified as a member of the
U.S. Klans, Knights of the KKK, Inc.

In September, 1970, we advised the President,
the Vice eredraiee and the Attorney General of the fact
that rd, Robert,,.Memeshelton.of the UKA was going
to eaueat an app ntment with .the Attorney General to discuss
the latest interpretations of civil rights laws. We further
advised that Shelton was preparing copies of a "night letter”
which he was @oing to make available to the news media in the
Washington, D. C., area to publicize the fact he desired an
appointment. This information was learned from a top 1
racial informant of our Birmingham Office who advised that
Shelton.was making this request aliegedly because it, in
Sbelton's mind, concerned the welfare of people of Alabama
in addition to those of other states. Our informant advised
that Shelton, would point out in his letter that appointments
for black leaders had been granted and he was requesting
equal opportunity, treatment and courtesy, on behalf of the
white people of his community. Our informant also revealed
that Shelton did not expect to receive an appointment with
the Attorney General but was doing this merely to receive
publicity as a result of this action. The appointment never
came about.

In November, 1970, as a result of counterintelli-
gence measures taken, we were successful in causing the
resignation of W. Melvin Sexton, the Imperial Kligrapp.
(National Secretary... UKA). This was was s of particular importance
in that he actually ran the UKA, during the time Shelton was
in prison.

The 1970 National Klonvokation of the UKA was held
at the Ramada Inn, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on November 28-29,
1970, At this Klonvokation, Robert M. Shelton was again
elected Imperial Wizard to serve for three years. During a
speech he made at the ‘Kionvokation, Shelton : stated (and has
since reiterated his feelings to nigh-ran ‘ing members of the
UKA who are racial informants of this Bureau) that he
definitely plans to use a polygraph machine and possibly
to utilize sodium peritothal (truth serum) on all Klan officials
and members in order to ferret out FBI informants. Shelton,
in 1967, also had plans to utilize a polygraph machine and
truth serum on Klan members in order to learn the identity of
FBI informants. At that time, we used counterintelligence
techniques in various torms inciuding 4 press release in order
to discourage Shelton in this regard. It is to be noted that

al

many of our sensitive racial informants are in high-ranking
positions within the UKA, fparraearesreeraernerasnaa

In order to again discourage Shelton in his
desires in this regard, it was recommended on 1/5/71 that
a press release be provided to reliable news sources through
Assistant Director Bishop's office. Our desire is that we
will discredit Shelton and frustrate his attempts by exposing
his desires to “the giare of publicity. The news release
pointed out that Shelton,is losing control of his, subordinates,
and that Shelton is attempting to maintain control of the,
Klanby threats against anyone who criticizes him. The news
release also pointed out that the Klan, which expresses
patriotism and democratic ideals, must resort to gestapo-like
tactics to hold its members in tine.

The above are highlights of results of Bureau
investigations into these matters. Many other disseminations
made throughout 1970 have resulted in the curtailment of
activity and disenchantment with the Klan and other white hate
group organizations. ;

NEW LEFT GROUPS UNIT

The work of this unit concerns Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) factions (with the exception of
Weatherman), other New Left campus.groups, the Key Activist
program, New Left Movement reports, New Left publications,
New Left informants, and the maintenance of a library of
"hand-out" material on the New Left for dissemination on a
high level to Government officials and responsible citizens.

In 1969 Worker Student Alliance (WSA), Weatherman,
and Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) factions of SDS split
into separate groups. Accomplishments concerning Weatherman
are reported elsewhere in this survey. The RYM faction of
SDS is now practically defunct, Currently, the largest faction
of SDS. is WSA faction. WSA is dominated by the pro-Chinese,
Marxist-Leninist Progressive Labor Party; and, while not as
violent as Weatherman, is avowedly a revolutionary group.

Our efforts to achieve informant coverage in WSA
showed results when WSA held its National Convention in
Chicago in December, 1970. Approximately 20 Bureau informants
attended this convention, and extensive information on

_activities at the convention was promptly reported and
disseminated. Through informants, we have encouraged faction-
alism in WSA. At the convention, dissident groups led by one
of our sources threatened a new split in SDS/WSA which may
occur in the near future, Such dissension will reduce the

| possibility that SDS might once again become a massive student

| organization as it was before its division in 1969,

Through the Key Activist program, we have focused
investigative attention on the leaders of the New Left
movement with the aim of prosecuting these leaders under
appropriate statutes, Federal or local, wherever possible.

AW 55151

At the present time, we have designated 75 individuals as

Key Activists. Of this number, 40 are currently the subject
of prosecutive action, This has definitely severely disrupted
the entire New Left movement as well as component New Left
organizations,

Through the New Left Movement reports prepared
quarterly by each field office, we have provided to interested
agencies timely and informative documents on the activities
of the New Left movement, thus making a substantial contribution
to the objective that responsible officials be fully aware of
the threat the New Left presents to our democratic society.

By closely following a myriad of New Left publications
ranging from those merely pornographic to those clearly
revolutionary, we have determined the leadership of these
publications; their propensity for violence and subversive
activities; sources of funds; and through dissemination have
advised interested officials and agencies, -Since these
publications frequently appear and disapp within a short
time, we are alert to the birth of new publications by following
various underground news service lists as well as other
documents and books which report new publications in this
field.

We have recognized that in the past, informant coverage
of New Left groups has not been adequate and accordingly have
given great emphasis to this aspect of our responsibility. As
a result, informant coverage in this area has been dramatically
increased. At present, we have_900 informants and sources of
all types providing coverage of the New Left. This number
includes 178 security informants and_410 potential security
informants, sansauae

Since the last inspection, New Left informants have
provided information which has: led to the indictment of a
number of New Left leaders on Federal and local charges;
located fugitives including some Weatherman fugitives; provided
advance information on numerous New Left demonstrations including
plans for violence; and furnished detailed information on the
organization, membership, and activities of a broad range of
New Left ‘Sroups. '

DocId:32989638 Page 391



| MW 55151 Docld:32989638 Page 392 : J7

The assistance of New Left informants has been
invaluable, and we are continuing to emphasize the development
of additional quality informants in this field.

Through the maintenance of a repository of "hand-out"
materials and publications on the New Left for distribution
to Government officials and responsible citizens, we have
assisted these important individuals to more fully understand
the subversive ramifications of the New Left movement.



ACCOMPLISHMENTS
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS UNIT - WEST :

Since the Summer of 1969, New Left extremists
have become increasingly identified as Marxist-Leninist
revolutionaries, and have utilized extreme violence in
effort to achieve their purpose. In the period since the
last inspection, the prosecution of these revolutionaries
has contityed to be one of our primary objectives, to the
end that individual terrorists are neutralized and their
organizat»aas are isolated; leaderless; and finally defunct.
We have had significant accomplishments in this regard. On
April 2, 1270, 12 leaders of Weatherman (the most violent
faction oS students -for a Democratic Society) were indicted
in Chicago on Federal Antiriot Law (ARL) charges. Other
Weathermas leaders were indicted on local charges and became
Bureau fugitives. The Weatherman organization has gone
undergroums and has taken extreme measures to avoid apprehension.
Reverthclsas, Live of these Weatherman leaders have been
located >s the FBI as a result of investigations by Agents
on New Les: squads in the field and through the efforts of
New Left xnformants.

- On July 23, 1970, in Detroit, Michigan, indictments
were obta-.ned against 13 Weatherman leaders for violation of
Federal oombing and gun control statutes. Five of these
individualis have since been arrested or have surrendered.

Dther Weatherman leaders remain in fugitive status
and intensive efforts to locate them continue. Already these
indictmenrss and arrests have had a noticeable effect on the
Weathermas organization. Bernardine Dohrn, a Weatherman
leader wax in May, 1970, Had declared’ a State of war against
the U. S. | announced in December, 1970, that Weatherman had
made a "1.iitary error" in tending to consider only “bombings
and pickzrac up the gun as revolutionary." Weatherman has
learned, “Sohrn said, that a group of "outlaws" who are
isolated From the youth communities cannot grow to include
large nummers of people.

Weatherman and their ilk will doubtless try to
organize wider support in the broad youth culture, most of
which is not presently committed to violence. By the
continuation of energetic efforts to prosecute the instigators
of violence, we can increase the isolation of terrorist groups
and reduce their influence on youth. This objective is being
forcefully pursued wherever possible. In Seattle, a group
of seven violence-prone individuals with Weatherman connections
were tried in November and December, 1970, on Federal ARL;
Conspiracy; and Destruction of Government Property charges.

A mistrial in this case was declared December 10, 1970; however,
due to the defendants' misconduct in court, all seven were

cited for contempt. These Seattle indictments were made possible
through New Left informant coverage.

The East Coast Conspiracy to Save Lives, led by the
notorious Berrigan, brothers, has been the subject of intensive
investigation since the last inspection, This group, which
is masked asa religion-oriented peace group, has actually
plotted kidnaping and violence, This matter has been presented
to a Federal Grand Jury with the result that six individuals,
including Philip, Berrigan, were indicted on January 12, 1971.

even other individuals, including Daniel Berrigan, were named
by the Grand Jury as unindicted coconspirators,

New Left organizations including Students for a Democratic
Society, Trotskyist Youth Socialist Alliance, the militant
Black Panther Party and a supporting cast of Old Left
organizations including the Communist Party, Progressive
Labor Party and Socialist Workers Party,

Three contingents have traveled to Cuba since
November, 1969, The first group was composed of 216 young
a4mericans who obtained their own transportation to Cuba in
defiance of the State Department ban on travel to that
country. These young revolutionaries were returned to
Canada at the expense of the Cuban Government which converted
a cattle boat into a makeshift troop ship. This boat
arrived in St. John, Canada, on February 12, 1970, and
immediately loaded 687 sympathetic American youths aboard
for its return trip to Cuba, This group, like the first
contingent, worked in the sugar cane fields until its
return by the same means of transportation on April 28,
1970, In August, 1970, the third contingent of the VB,
made up of 407 persons, journeyed to the Isle of Youth
where they participated in a Cuban agricultural experiment
of planting and fertilizing citrus trees, This group
“returned to the U, S, mid-October, 1970,

Each group worked approximately 74 hours a day,
5% days a.woek, and in their free time were afforded the
opportunity of absorbing communist propaganda offered by
the Cubans, North Koreans and North Vietnamese, They were
reminded by the Cuban camp director that they were here to
show "solidarity with the socialist struggle to smash the
U. S. blockade, and to make a breach in the facade of the

Each of the more than 1300 brigade |members has been
the subject of a security investigation which includes the
identitication and obtaining of background data as well as
a personal interview with each brigade member. These
investigations are being made to determine the immediate
danger presented by these young revolutionaries and also
to ascertain the long-range role they will take in the
revolutionary mévement in the U. S. Upon completion of
the investigation and the interview of each of these
individuals, the field must recommend either the inclusion
or noninclusion of the subject in the Security Index, In
addition the field must continue to report every 90 days
for a period of one year on the activities and whereabouts
of each brigade member.

Five approved Bureau informants accompanied the
second VB,and the third VB also included in its ranks four
Bureau approved informants. These sources have materially

1968, to July 7, 1970. Breed on the results of FBI investigation,
- on the latter date he was expelled after the Department of State

informed the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C., on June 24,

1970, that Orekhoy had engaged in activities incompatible with

his Status asa as_a_journalist His departure from the United States

was requested. _Orekhov departed July 7, 1970, depriving the 7

Soviets of the presence in the U. 8. of a very active intelli-

gence officer.

In a similar case, also as a result of our investi-
gations, on November 6, 1970, State informed _the Soviets of the
expuksionifrom the U. 8. of Li Ni hegalov a

si This action was in direct ty for the expulsion
from the USSR of a U. S, correspondent. 7

saad In an interesting and successful counterintelligence
operation, the Soviets were forced to remove Yey

a KGB officer, from the United Nations Secretariat and send him
home. Xelshin, had been in contact with sources under our control
in the aerospace field. In September, 1970, the "arrest" of one

of our sources during a meet with Yelshin was staged. Subsequently,
Yelshin was contacted by our Agents concerning his intelligence
activities. Although Yelshin had not completed the term of his
contract with the UN Secretariat, he returned home with his

family, at Soviet expense, on 11/1/70.

In a pending case, our investigation has established
violation of U. S. immigration laws by an individual known to be
a KGB agent. He has denied affiliation with the Soviets, but has
admitted immigration fraud. INS and State have initiated action
to have him dismissed from the UN Secretariat and expelled from

We told State how the one, a Polish military intelligence
officer, with the assistance of the other had since mid-1969
been very active in trying to purchase electronic equipment of *
defense significance and ship it to Poland in violation of
export licensing requirements. On 3/27/70, State informed the
Polish Ambassador to the U. 8. that the activities of these two
Poles must cease. Both left the country. We have subsequently

One measure of our effectiveness in countering the
activities of the intelligence personnel among the hundreds of
communist bloc representatives in the U. S. is our ability to
continue to develop and operate double agents against hostile
agents. This is a matter of vital concern and continuous
attention in the Espionage Section. Since the last inspection
we have continued to improve our position in this regard, as
the following chart shows:

It is obvious that despite the sophistication and
security-consciousness of the Soviet Intelligence Services, our
efforts to direct double agents against them continue to meet
with conspicuous success. Examples of the productivity of our
double agent operations appear elsewhere herein.

Some declines in the number of double agent operations
against the intelligence services of countries other than the
USSR handled by this section have occurred since the last
inspection. In part, this may be a reflection of a change of
emphasis in direction of our efforts, whi

e bu. of the drop in the number of active and potential
double agents has been in the czech field, This is attributable
primarily to two factors.

Following the occupation of Czechoslovakia (CSSR) by
Soviet bloc armed forces in August, 1968, which resulted in the
fall of the liberal Alexander Dubcek regime, the Communist Party
of the CSSR began a critical analysis of all party members who
had supported Dubcek. This analysis included individuals
assigned to diplomatic posts in Washington and New York and
resulted in the recall of about two-thirds of such personnel.
A number were expelled or suspended from the Party. Of those
recalled, several have not yet been replaced. the Chief Czech

dropped to rock bottom and, as consequence, little intelligence
work was carried on during the current year. Naturally, with
the Cis agents missing or dormant, ow opportunities to target
double agents against, them diminished. This unsettled political
situation, together with the overt defection of a CIS officer
in Washington on 6/29/70, resulted in the CIS assuming a
defensive posture and maintaining contact only with persons
considered by them to be fully trustworthy. Indicative of the~
quality of our remaining double agents is the fact that CIS has

The above chart, showing numbers of double agents at
the time of the last inspection and at present tells only part
of the story. It does not show that there is a continual
process of review and analysis of double agent matters and
close attention to field activity in this regard. We are
constantly striving to weed out any "deadwood" and to introduce
fresh blood into our counterespionage efforts. Presentation
of precise figures on the turnover among double agents during
the period since the last inspection is not feasible, because
various offices have different reporting dates on which they

- inform the Bureau of additions and deletions of double agents

in the various nationality fields. However, the following
available figures clearly indicate desirable turnover. In the
Soviet field, from March 1, 1970, to December 1, 1970, we added
ALactive and potential double agents; a net increase Of 3Qsmen
In the other countries currently supervised in the Espionage
Section, we added 28 active and potential double agents and
dranned AZ a net “Sain of ll. Several of those dropped were
used up ‘in’ counterintelligéfee actions which terminated their
active usefulness, and some left the country.

3. Counterintelligence and Other Significant Operations

i In our eyes, counterintelligence activity is activity
‘designed to disrupt and hamper the operations of an opposition
intelligence service. Although it may involve harassment at
times, it is for the most part much more serious and worthy of
our efforts only when it inflicts actual damage on the effective-
ness of the enemy. To this end, we.employ our own capabilities
and, whenever indicated and possible, those of other U. S. and
other Government agencies. Following are some examples of this
activity since the last inspection.

.. As a result of Bureau counterintelligence action,
an Aeroflot official who was a GRU officer was hurriedly
removed from the U. S. under Soviet guard by the Soviets. In
addition, an Intourist official, a suspected KGB officer, was
also recalled from the U. S. because he was also blamed by the
Soviets for the security breach involving the aforementioned
Aeroflot official. Thus, one counterintelligence operation
caused the removal from the U. 8. of two Soviet intelligence
Service operatives.

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE SEC

The key to developing racial information on a regular
and current basis is the operation and development of quality
informants along with intensified investigation. In this
regard we have increased the number of our racial informants
since the last Inspection by 1,699 which brings our total
number of informants to 7,184. In addition, we are continually
intensifying our investigations and in line with our need for
closer coverage of key black extremists, we instituted by airtel
dated 12-23-70 the Key Black Extremist Program,

Racial informants have been furnishing a steady flow

of valuable racial information which information has brought

about the apprehension of badly wanted extremist fugitives,

the confiscation of explosives and firearms in the possession of
i extremists, the prevention of violence and the saving of lives.
| In addition, these informants furnished valuable racial

intelligence on a regular basis which intelligence included
i information concerning foreign influence, the Black Panther Party
(BPP) underground as well as discussions by extremists as to
South American style kidnapping of government officials and threats
to kill the President.

It is significant to note that since the last Inspection
racial informants have been responsible for bringing about the
arrest of 510 individuals, 342 of which were local arrests and
168 Federal arrests as well as being responsible for the recovery
of $330,179.03.

In order to improve our investigations and racial
informant coverage in addition to our regular supervision
furnished from the Seat of Government we held a two-day conference
with racial supervisors from 39 field offices plus two legal
attaches. The topics discussed at the conference covered the
entire spectrum of the problems inherent in investigating and

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

JGD:bad

mW S5252 Doctd-32989638 Page 408



developing informants in the BPP as well as related extremist
matters. These topics included detailed discussion concerning
the need for full penetration of extremist groups to obtain
information concerning terroristic activities which may be
aimed against Government officials. In addition, the conference
took note that maximum attention should be given to the extremist
activities in Canada in connection with our investigations as well
\as intensifying our investigations having international

! ramifications,

The above items, along with other items affecting
counterintelligence against extremists, the BPP underground
activities and intensified investigations were fully discussed.
Concrete suggestions were obtained from this conference and were
subjects of individual memoranda which were approved thereby
increasing the efficiency of our investigations and informant
developm

Some of the above-approved suggestions are as
follows:

1. Proposal to identify escape routes utilized by
black extremists to flee the United States by utilizing a Bureau
racial informant as a decoy,

2. Intensify BPP underground investigations including
making available to select field offices copies of the film
"The Battle of Algiers," which sets forth guerrilla warfare

. tactics used successfully by the National Liberation Front
and which is now being studied and copied by the BPP.

3. Granting approval for Special Agents in Charge
on their own initiative to authorize use of concealed recording
devices by a Special Agent or proven source in covering public
appearances by black and New Left extremists except where such

| appearances are at educational institutions,

4, Obtaining approval to reproduce an article by
Wictor Riesel, noted labor columnist, which article was highly
critical of the BPP and set forth a proposal by a union member
that unions affiliated with the freight handlers who handle

. the BPP newspaper shipments refuse to handle these papers.

_ 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 409



5, Obtaining approval for a racial and New Left

extremist activities In-Service classes.
t :

6. Obtaining approval for the deletion of the
Black Extremist Bureau Fugitive List from the Black Nationalist
Movement in the United States Racial Calendar and transmitting
this to the field by separate letter in order to give greater
emphasis to these fugitive investigations.

7. Obtaining approval for revising the Agitator Index
by deleting those individuals who are also included on the
Security Index.

In addition to the above, there are other suggestions
made by the attendees at the conference and approved by the
Director which will assist in streamlining the overall
investigative aud infvriiant development operation as well-as
making these operations more effective.

ear Some of the concrete examples of our informant and
investigative accomplishments can be seen in the following:

Through our investigations, we have currently
identified and closely scrutinized the activities of the 43
branches of the BPP which covers an area of 31 states and the
District of Columbia, These investigations reveal that the BPP
membership has increased to 1,000 hard-core members which is an
increase of 250 in the last six months.

As a result of our investigations and informant
penetration along with the cooperation with local authorities,
408. BPP members have been arrested on either Federal or local
charges during 1970.

Racial informants in the Te Angeles and Chicago

| Divisions were successful in penetrating the BPP underground and
a now will be in a position to furnish information on BPP

| underground activities.

In connection with underground activities, a Dallas.
racial informant furnished the information which brought about
the arrest of Elmer Gerard Pratt, a los Angeles BPP leader and
an alleged leader in the underground. Pratt's arrest along with

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 410

the arrest of four other of his associates enabled us to

| obtain possession of documents apparently relating to the BPP
underground and should give us knowledge concerning it and the
possible identities of others involved in this underground

operation, i
FE ,

In early June, 1970, efforts were made to establish

a National Committee to Combat Fascism (NCCF) chapter, which is

another name for a BPP chapter in Tampa, Florida. Through

aggressive investigation, including thorough interrogation of
all known members, the development of a_top-level informant

and effective use of information provided by this informant,

Tampa Office was successful in decimating this group to the
i point where it is now floundering, nameless and without
leadership and there is no indication of support for the BPP
in that area,

The Black Afro Militant Movement (BAMM) was organized
in the Miami Division in the early part of 1970. The leader of
this group was Alfred Dwight Amos Featherston, an articulate
black extremist and an admitted communist who has in the past,
visited Fidel Castro in Cuba. Through the outstanding informant
coverage developed by the Miami Office and the aggressive
investigative techniques used, this organization for all intent
and purposes, rendered inactive by the latter part of 1970.
During 1970, BAMM engaged in an intensive recruiting program
in the Miami area directed toward young blacks, formed an action
| group which participated in a number of fire bombings in the
Miami area including one such bombing at the University of Miami.
| Through informant coverage and other investigative activities,
| the Miami Division developed an excellent case involving the
teaching and demonstrating of explosive devices and in December
the Departmental Attorneys presented this matter to a Federal
Grand Jury in Miami resulting in Featherston, Charles Reiley and
Jerome,.Trapp. being indicted under the new antiriot laws dealing
with the teaching and making of incendiary devices. This is the
first such case brought under the new statute charging black
extremists with this particular violation.

A Detroit racial informant furnished advanced
information regarding planned ambush of Detroit police officers
which, when furnished to Detroit Police Department, enabled them
to take necessary action to prevent injury or death to the officers
and resulted in the arrest of eight persons and the seizure of
a cache of weapons. Informant also furnished information
resulting in the location and confiscation by Bureau Agents of
approximately 50 sticks of dynamite available to BPP and likely
resulted in saving of lives and preventing possible property
damage.

A Chicago racial informant furnished information which
identified an individual who is a member of the BPP as the person
who raped and shot a middle aged white housewife and then pistol
whipped her husband in Chicago on 12-25-70. The same Chicago
informant furnished information which resulted in the
identification of an individual who was responsible for the
murder of a police officer in Carbondale, Illinois.

A Springfield ghetto informant furnished information
concerning an individual who was attempting to sell explosives
for $2,000. This information enabled local authorities to
apprehend the individual and confiscate 100 lbs. of explosives.

A Boston racial informant made a verbatim recording
of a speech by a BPP member where he indicated the Panthers
should utilize South American style kidnappings in order to
effect the release of Panther political prisoners.

A Norfolk racial informant furnished daily information
relating to a.demonstration at Norfolk State College 5/8-18/70.

During this demonstration she reported the Student Government,
President. at the college threatened to kill President Nixon and
observed another student burning the American flag. Based on

this information, Secret Service is considering prosecution against

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 412



the Student Government President and local police are
prosecuting the student who burned the flag.

A New York informant furnished the identities of
black extremists who were scheduled to depart the U.S. for
Al Fatah camp in the Middle East for possible guerrilla
training.

In discussing the accomplishments of the Racial
Intelligence Section, it is felt that comment should be made
concerning the contributions regularly being made by the
Inspection Division during their analysis of the racial
investigations in the various field divisions. In addition
to acting upon information furnished to them by this Section,
the Inspection Staff through their on-the-spot review of racial
intelligence matters in the field are often able to detect
weaknesses not apparent at the Seat of Government and offer
constructive assistance to the office involved in strengthening
their operations.

In reviewing the racial surveys prepared by the
Inspection Division, we regularly note concrete guidance being ©
afforded field offices. Examples can be found in recent
instructions given during the inspection of the Mobile Office
to direct two existing informants to seek membership in the
Nation of Islam (NOI). These instructions were implemented and
both informants currently report on NOI activities and have
membership applications pending.

During a recent Cleveland inspection, the Inspectors
gave instructions for the Cleveland Office to develop informants
in a leadership position with the Cleveland National Committee
to Combat Fascism (NCCF), As a result of these instructions,
Cleveland has been successful in developing two informants within
this organization both of whom are furnishing valuable information

-on the structural composition of the organization, staff members
and proposed activities. One of these informants is a member of
the security cadre of the Cleveland NCCF and as such has
furnished valuable information concerning firearms in possession
of members of this group.

Docld: 32989638 Page 413



Racial intelligence gathered thrpugh our informants
and investigations makes up a major portion of the Bureau's
sophisticated document which is disseminated to the
White House and other high level Government agencies. This
document captioned "FBI Summary of Extremist Activities"
furnishes the White House and other agencies with a digest
of the racial picture,

The quality of our racial informants can also be
judged by the fact that since the last Inspection, 26 Special
Agents in various field divisions were recommended for incentive
awards for their work in developing informants and 15 racial
informants were given bonus awards for valuable information
they furnished and services performed.

Israeli and Middle East Investigations

Prior to the beginning of the 25th Session of the United

Nations General Assembly, this Unit recognized the vulnerability of
the large concentration of foreign diplomats attending the Session to
acts of terrorism and demonstrations originating with groups dissenting
with the incumbent regimes of the countries represented. We issued
appropriate instructions to the field to alert sources and provide.
information immediately which would indicate a threat to the physical
security or well being of these dignitaries who were coming to the
United States for the Commemorative Session of the United Nations.
Subsequent to this action, the White House similarly recognized the
potential danger of embarrassment to the United States as host country
for the United Nations if incidents occurred, and called on the Bureau
to cooperate fully with United States Secret Service to uncover such
incidents and provide full security for the chiefs of state and missions
resident in New York City during the commemorative celebration.
We established a system of liaison with United States Secret Service
command post in New York City, as well as intensifying our liaison
with New York City police and United States Mission to the United Nations.
A flow of information from our sources was furnished to the interested
agencies locally and to the intelligence community at a national level
-which resulted in laudatory comments by Secret Service liaison

* personnel who commented favorably on the Bureau's assistance in
completing the Presidentially ordered mission of United States
Secret Service in providing security for the officials mentioned.

During the same period of the 25th General Assembly of
the United Nations, we furnished a continuing flow of information to the
United States United Nations Mission regarding the the terise Middle East
_ situation and developments related to peace talks instituted by the
‘United States and carried out by United Nations officials. The data
furnished to the United States United Nations Mission resulted in the
United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Charles W. Yost,
advising the Director by letter dated 11/13/70 of his desire to pay
special tribute to Agents of this Bureau who had provided him with
swift and accurate reports which he had found helpful and which provided
him with privileged insight and perspective into the maneuverings
during the 25th Session.

In the Israeli field we have continued to furnish information
from our Sensitive coverage w under a program of dissemination which
information is furnished only to select individuals at the White House
and to a previously cleared chain of command within agencies of the
intelligence community. These data relate to attempts by officials of
ithe Iszaeli.Government to obtain favorable reaction within United States
Government circles for Israeli Government support including economic
and military assistance. The personalities involved in these dealings
have included prominent members of the United States Congress as well
as individuals within the executive arm of our Government. Favorable
comment has been forthcoming from Dr. Kissinger at the White House,
from the Secretary of State and from other dignitaries within the
intelligence community who have been privy to this "SCOPE! information
relative to its timeliness and value to them in for: wuuLating policy decisions
within our Government.

Miscellaneous Programs

This Unit has the supervisory responsibility for extremely
sensitive operations undertaken in cooperation with the National
Security Agency, (NSA) designed ' to enhance our nation's ‘capability
to infiltrate the diplomatic, communications of foreign governments.
Our first significant “préakthrough in this area occurred in 1968 and

. resulted in NSA estimate of $200,000 annually in evaluating t g the
product of our coverage. We have realized continued success in this

» sensitive area with two additional successes since the last inspection

for a total of four nationality areas beine totally covered,by,the, Bureau .
‘at this time. Dr, Louis W. Tordella, Acting Director, Ni
letter dated 11/10/10, commented. mosi.tavarably,.on.the, produc
of of opr program jn. jis- area, not that our coverage provided
“information of priority concern to the NSA which would be otherwise
unobtainable to the United States Government. In view of the extreme
sensitivity of this information, it is suggested that either I or my
Number One Man be consulted for further details.

In the miscellaneous espionage area a decided accomplishment
was attained with close of investigation relating to Vernon Edward
_Thompso, son,of Santa Barbara,.California. In September and October,
“1970, high officials of the intelligence and military communities,
cabinet members, Dr. Henry A. Kissinger and Mr. Herbert J. Klein

of the White House Staff and other highly placed United States Government
officials began receiving cryptogram messages which, after decryption,
disclosed implication of bombings of certain major cities on 11/29/70.
Content of the messages revealed that the writer was privy to intelligence
information and possibly had knowledge of United States nuclear weapon
deployment, The receipt of these messages was the object of extreme
‘concern by the recipients and resulted in our investigation.

Through outstandingly aggressive and imaginative investigation
and with a dearth of investigative leads, the Los Angeles Office
successfully identified the typewriter on which the messages were
being prepared as being located in a library in the Santa Barbara, area.
Discreet and productive surveillance was conducted, which resulted in
identification of Thompson and his neutralization as a point of anxiety
and concern on the part of the highest level of officials in the executive
branch and in the intelligence community. We are now awaiting a
decision as to prosecution after review of the details of this matter
by the Criminal Division of the Department.

The President has noted the paucity of positive intelligence
information available to him for high-level policy decisions. We
have recognized our responsibilities in this area through intensified
coverage in the nationality fields supervised by this Unit as illustrated
in the increase of establishments being afforded sensitive coverage

_ and through the increase of our live informant coverage targeted
against the nations involved. Three of the six new foreign liaison
posts established recently by the Bureau involve countries within
the area of responsibility of this Unit and information from those
liaison posts should add to the production of our foreign intelligence
information in response to President Nixon's requirements.

CUBAN UNIT

Our sustained pressure on Cuban Intelligence
Service (CuIS) operations in the U.S, resulted in the recall
to Cuba of three very experienced CuIS officers in April, 1970.
They had been serving as officials of the Cuban Mission to the
United Nations (CMUN) and thelr. withdrawal was in line with

"Based on FBI information, a leading Puerto Rican
terrorist in New York City (Carlos Feliciano Vasquez,), was
apprehended by the New York City Police Department on May 16,
1970, while in the process of placing a bomb in an Armed Forces
recruiting station.

After being confronted by us in early August, 1970,

a very attractive and sexually permissive employee of the
South African Embassy, Washington, D.C., admitted her “deep
involvement with the CulS. She had furnished the Cubans data
concerning American and foreign officials with whom she was in
social contact. After becoming sexually involved with a State

- Department protocol officer in March, 1970, she was able to gain
entree to diplomatic functions where she met ranking officials
and employees of the U.S. and foreign governments. Our investi-
gation indicated she was unable to establish contact with her
principal to furnish information concerning the dignitaries she
met following her involvement with the protocol officer and she
voluntarily returned home to South Africa shortly after our
interview of her. Her name is “Jennifer Enid Miles.

A San Juan Office source was primarily responsible
for developing information leading to the conviction on 8/26/70
of four Socialist Workers Party (PSO) leaders in Puerto Rico.
The information developed by our source enabled the Police of
Puerto Rico to arrest a total of nine PSO members. The PSO has
been active in the wave of bombings taking place in Puerto Rico
and the arrests were for violations of the Puerto Rican Explosives
Law.

During the Summer of 1970 a countérintelligence
program aimed at creating dissension was instituted by our
San Juan Office against the activist Puerto Rican Socialist
League (LSP). On October 10, 1970, a high-placed Miami
security informant reported the LSP was showing signs of
grinding to a halt and that it recently experienced a severe
split away from its youth group. Our counterintelligence
move was directly responsible for the havoc occurring in the
LSP.

As a result of disclosures made by Jennifer Enid

Milesand other corroborative evidence develéped by New York
and | Washington Field Office, we were able to have State Depart-
ment declare persona non grata the two highest ranking CuIS
officials in the U.S. on October 9, 1970. _ Counsellor R

Rodriguez Lopez and First Secretary, Orlando Prendes Gui

On October 10, 1970, Filiberto Ojeda Rios, a known

Cuban espionage agent and a Bureau feau fugitive, was apprehended
by FBI agents and the Police of Puerto Rico. (¢ la, leader of
the Puerto Rican Armed Revolutionary Independence Movement (MIRA),
had been the prime mover behind the wave of violence and

‘ terrorist bombings which has occurred for many months in Puerto
Rico. Documents found at his hideout definitely confirmed the
close collaboration between the Cuban Government and Puerto
Rican terrorist groups.

On October 19, 1970, an intensification program was
instituted by our Miami Office based on instructions from the
Bureau aimed at identifying CuIS agents in the Miami area who are
pelieved to be tipping off Castro concerning infiltration
efforts by anti-Castro refugees in the U.S, A coordinator had
been made responsible for directing these efforts and progress
has been made in eliminating certain suspects as well as
developing valuable background regarding other logical suspects.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

‘MIDDLE AND SOUTH AMERICAN UNIT

The President and other policy makers have
a continuing interest in current political matters
affecting Central and South America. We have provided
officials in the Executive Branch of the Government
on a continuing basis with information concerning the
activities of political figures and leftist groups in
a number of Latin American nations. Of particular
significance was information concerning the activities
of ArnulfoAriasMadrid,..deposed,.kanamanian~pnesident.
residing in Miami, Florida, yo is planning the over-
throw of the current Panamanian Government. In an
effort to provide the President and other policy makers
with even more such information, we have recently
expanded our coverage in the Chilean, Peruvian and
Bolivian fields.

The unit continues to be successful in
thwarting plans of militant anti-~Castre groups which
have sought to infiltrate Cuba and to attack ships and
property of foreign nations engaged in trade with Cuba.
Successful development of key informants who have
infiltrated anti-Castro groups under Bureau direction
has enabled the Bureau to keep abreast of their activities
and often to have advance knowledge of the plans of these
groups enabling us to take appropriate action to prevent
such activities. An outstanding example of our success
in this area was the thwarting of two militant anti-Castro
; attempts in July, 1970, to infiltrate Cuba and the seizure
of boats, arms, ammunition and miscellaneous military
‘ equipment valued at $64,500 by U, S. authorities.

THE CHINESE UNIT

7 As a result of our close cooperation with ROMP,

_ that agency, in 12/70, provided us with details of one of
its double agent operations which clearly depicted intensi-
fication of Chinese communist (Chicom) intelligence efforts
directed against the United States. We learned that the
Chicoms have funded travel of the RCMP source to New York
and Washington, D.C., where the source undertook to fulfill
intelligence contacts and development of data for the Chicoms.

‘As a result of getting this information, we learned that

Chicoms desire to lay the foundation to get "our people"
(Chicoms) into the United States under suitable cover,

probably when the Chicom Embassy epens in Canada in the very

near future. The Director's letter to the Commissioner,

auemeuel SPECIAL COORDINATION UNIT

During December, 1970, six new foreign offices were
established, As a result of personnel moves, 19 Special Agents
and 16 clerks were transferred to foreign offices each requiring
passport, visa, and Department of State and Embassy notifica-
tion. The numerous contacts with State and the outgoing
letters (two for each person transferred) were handled in
this Unit, together with the memoranda and notification to
the White House regarding various phases of the operation.

A special one-week indoctrination session was arranged and
attended by most of the new Special Agent personnel. The
Director's instructions that the expansion take place were
issued 11-20-70. Each of the new offices was open and opera~
ting during December, 1970.

Through liaison with appropriate officials at the
White House, the interest of those officials in proposed
legislation which would provide increased retirement benefits
for FBI personnel has been maintained. The advice of these
officials concerning channels to be used in promoting this
legislation was secured and has been followed.

5 Since the last inspection, SA Haynes,has expedited
and coordinated visits of the Director to the “White House on
approximately six occasions. This has included meeting the
Director, taking him to the meeting site, introducing him to
persons present if not known to him, and assuring his return
to his car by the most direct route following the meeting.

: Through carefully controlled contacts with the
Commission on Campus Unrest, it was possible to secure a
copy of their report in advance in order to insure that there
were no unfavorable comments concerning the FBI. ‘The left-
wing staff of. this Commission was very active in areas of
direct interest to the Bureau, and SA Haynes was able to avoid
any conflict and there were no derogatory references to our
work made by this group.

“Direct personal liaison was established during the
period with Washington representatives of two additional

countries: The Union of South Africa, and Japan. The

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM : 4-H
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS

BACKGROUND AND DATE OF INCEPTION

Studies pertaining to the handling of individuals
who in time of an emergency would represent a potential threat
to the national security began prior to World War II. The
actual program began in June, 1940, and dealt mainly with
lists of individuais considered for detention in the event
of a’ threat to the national security,

SCOPE AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES

This program is field-wide in scope. The goal of the
Security Index (SI) Program is the identification of individuals
who because of their membership and activity and/or association
with subversive organizations are dangerous or potentially
dangerous to the internal security of the country. The progran
includes the collection of sutficient iniormation reiating to
the activities of such individuals to justify their apprehension
and detention in the event of a national emergency. Another
goal of the SI is to maintain it in a current status in the
event immediate implementation is necessary to minimize

a possibilities of espionage, sabotage and subversion.

‘POSITIVE RESULTS ACHIEVED SINCE LAST INSPECTION

By way of background, in February, 1969, as a matter
of temporary expediency, the Executives Conference approved
a moratorium on certain Security Matter - Communist investigations
and periodic report writing in Priority II and Priority III
Security Index cases; moratorium later extended to January 1, 1971.
By memorandum October 29, 1970, from the Executives Conference 7
to Mr. Tolson, approved by the Director, the moratorium was
lifted. At the time there were approximately 10,690 individuals
on the SI who were of the Priority II and III types. Virtually
no investigation had been conducted regarding approximately 7,000
of these individuals since the imposition of the moratorium in

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM 4-H
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS

February, 1969. Many of these persons had changed residence
and/or employment and their whereabouts were unknown. It can
thus be seen that the lifting of the moratorium was an
aggressive, timely and precise step toward fulfilling ow current
responsibilities, especially in knowing the whereabouts of
these individuals. Implementation was directed by airtel
November 3, 1970, to all offices, and in doing so we took a
realistic step in permitting the field to stagger the reopening
of these cases so that they would be spread out over the period

. November 3, 1970, to June 30, 1971. This was considered
essential in view of our approximation that it would be necessary
to reopen approximately 7,000 of the Priority II and III types.

EXTENT AND NATURE OF CURRENT SUPERVISION

Responsibility for administrative handling of the $I.
rests with the Special Records Unit of the Research Section.
Responsibility for individual cases rests with appropriate
supervisory personnel. I personnally follow this matter closely
to insure it is current and that necessary changes are made
where desirable, This program receives constant supervision.

. SUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUANCE

This is a major internal security program based upon
Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and is to he
implemented in the event of a national emergency to minimize
acts of espionage, sabotage and subversion.

FREQUENCY OF EVALUATION

The SI Program is constantly being re-evaluated. The
most recent justification is contained in memorandum from
Charles D, Brennan to W. C. Sullivan dated January 8, 1970, and
as of instant date (January 12, 1971) a current rejustification
memorandum is in preparation.

| SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM ! 4-H
BASIC REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS

At the time of the last inspection in April, 1970, we
had 279 member security informants in the Communist Party, USA
(CPUSA), while at the present time we have 264 member informants
in the CPUSA, a decrease of 15, In addition, there are 31
member informants in the Socialist Workers Party (SWP); the
number of SWP informants at last inspection is not known.

On December 16, 1970, a reorganization of Sections
within the Division resulted in a realignment of informant
handling and record keeping, with the result that only informants
in basic revolutionary organizations and related groups are now
handled in the Internal Security Section. As of December 16,
1970, there were 578 informants in basic revolutionary organiza-
tions and related groups. The number at last inspection is not
known,

There has been continuing recognition of the fact that
there must be no letdown in maintaining adequate informant
coverage in basic revolutionary organizations. In this regard,
SAC Letter 70-40 dated August 4, 1970, captioned "Racial and

_ Security Informants," pointed out in-depth quality informants

AW 55151

in these fields are more imperative than ever under present
conditions in view of the upsurge in violence. SAC Letter
70-48 dated September 15, 1970, captioned "Security and Racial
Informants," pointed out that never in our history have we
been confronted with as critical a need for informant coverage.
This SAC Letter authorized development of informants between
the ages of 18 and 21, thus presenting the field with a
tremendous opportunity to expand informant coverage not only
among violence-prone New Left and radical groups, but also in
the basic revolutionary groups as well. There can be no doubt
but that these instructions have stimulated development of
informants.

Security informant development receives continuous
supervision, It is not technically a program justified
annually, but rather a fundamental procedure in our investigative
operations that requires and receives vigorous day-to-day
attention,

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM ~ DISRUPTION OF WHITE HATE GROUPS 4-H

BACKGROUND, DATE OF INCEPTION AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES

This program was initiated in September, 1964, for
the purpose of exposing, disrupting and otherwise neutralizing
activities of white extremist organizations, their leaders and
adherents. There are currently 17 field offices regularly
participating in this program and as specific situations arise
other divisions also participate.

POSITIVE RESULTS ACHIEVED

The following are highlights of accomplishments
achieved through this program since last inspection: A racial
informant of the Birmingham Division has been able to influence
Robert, Shelton, leader _of the largest Klan. Sroup, Unitea Kians
“ot America, Inc., (UKA), to be more moderate in his speeches
by opposing violence and stressing need for law and order as
well as continuing his acts against communism, This has been
effective in toning down Klan violence,

Midwest coordinator of National Socialist White
People's Party, formerly known as American Nazi Party, was
expelled from that organization after publicity furnished under
this program disclosed he was of Jewish descent,

Through manipulation of informants, anonymous letters
and utilization of friendly press services we were successful
in creating a split in the UKA in North Carolina, This split
was brought about when a rally of dissident Klansmen in i
September, 1969, showed their disaffection with the UKA leader-
ship by burning their Klan membership cards. This split was
highlighted in front -page news stories in North Carolina
newspapers,

During 1970 National Klonvokation, Robert Shelton,
who_was,again elected Imperial Wizard, made a Speech indicating
his feelings that high ranking members of the UKA may be disloyal
and that he definitely plans to use a polygraph machine and

possibly utilize sodium pentothal (truth serum) on all Klan
officers and members to ferret out FBI informants, As a result,
we recently furnished reliable news sourceS*with information in
belief that public exposure will deter considerably from any
future enactment of these plans, It is too early to determine
results of this move at this time.

As a result of counterintelligence action taken
through racial informants in the Knoxville Division, we were ~
successful in having the Exalted a Cyclops of Mascot Klavern #778,
Mascot, Tennessee, Thomas Stipes, S, eliminated from this top
position and were able to have him subsequently banished from
the Klan. This was brought about by having our racial informants
ereate dissenSion within the ranks of this Klavern,

Through the use of two racial informants of our
Little Rock Division, we were successful in causing the defeat
of a Klansmen who was campaigning to be elected as sheriff of
xson is. individual, Victor Calvert.
Exalted Cyc. DS » ern, Association of Arkansas
Kians, in conducting his campaign attempted to hide his Klan
affiliations because he hoped to receive a good percentage of
the Negro vote in his area, Our informants were successful
in discreetly letting out the word of his secret Klan membership.

As a result of counterintelligence action taken,
Wy, Melvin Sexton, Imperial Kligrapp (National Secretary) of the
UKA, the largest Kian organization in the country, resigned fron
his position, Both Sexton and his wife, in addition to being
Klan members, were ‘employed in the National Office of the
United Klans of America, This is particularly significant in
that for many years Sexton had been “number one man" to Imperial
Wizard Robert M. Shelton ‘Of the UKA and actually ran the UKA
while Shelton was 10 prison following his conviction for
Contempt of Congress, This resignation was brought about by
our informants planting the seeds of distrust regarding Sexton
and eanonemeet a a that Sexton had a serious drinking problem,

CURRENT SUPERV IS ION AND JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUANCE

investigation. All counterintelligence proposals are submitted
to the Bureau for approval and positive results achieved from
this program, when balanced against the relatively small
expenditure of Agent and supervisory time, indicates that its
continuance is justified. This program is re-evaluated annually
and was last re-evaluated by memorandum G. C. Moore to

sac Letter 53~ 72(3) dated October 27, 1953, to insure that
the field is using current characterizations of subversive
organizations and to provide uniformity in characterizing
such organizations, Those characterizations deemed to be of
field-wide interest are now to be furnished to the field by
letter to all offices on an annual basis rather than by
SAC Letter as was formerly the practice, in accordance with
approval of suggestion in memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr
dated December 7, 1970.

The background and value of this program is the same
as it was at the time of the write-ups for the 1970 inspection.
Upon receipt of the annual letters from the field in June, 1970,
422 separate characterizailons were received and x cued by
appropriate supervisory personnel at the Bureau. Those of
field-wide interest were furnished to the field by SAC Letter
70-62 dated November 3, 1970, The remaining characterizations
were returned to interested field offices following their
approval by the Bureau. This program was last reviewed and
analyzed and its continuance approved by memorandum R, L.
Shackelford to Mr. C. D, Brennan dated October i2, 1970,

New Left Movement
Section Chief: R. L. Shackelford _

‘ The following surveys, projects and/or intensification
programs are in effect against the New Left movement:

By airtel to SAC, Albany, and all offices, dated
10/23/68, the field was instructed to expand its Key Activist
programs and these programs were intensified. Each office
was instructed to submit its recommendations on individuals
considered as Key Activists. The field was instructed to
maintain high-level informant coverage on these individuals.
The purpose of this program is to render Key Activists
ineffective and thereby drastically reduce their influence
in:the-New Left movement. At the present time there are 75 Key
Activists under intensive investigation. A Key Activist Album
which contains photographs and biographical data on each Key
Activist has been assembled and has been furnished to all offices.
The Key Activist Album is maintained in a current status, 46
are subjects of prosecutive action. The Album has proven to
be invaluable in following the activities and travels of New
Left activists, both for the Seat of Government and for the
field.

By airtel dated 3/10/69 to SAC, Albany, and all offices,
‘ the field was instructed to submit summary reports every three
months on those individuals designated as Key Activists. The
field was also instructed to prepare an appropriate communication
suitable for dissemination in the event any of these individuals
held a speaking engagement and whenever they made a statement
indicating a propensity for violence or urging student agitation.
The purpose of this program was te develop information in
respect to the securing of testimony and evidence concerning
violations of statutes within the Bureau's jurisdiction in
connection with leaders involved with campus disorders.

By letter to all offices dated 5/5/69, the field was
instructed that when it is ascertained that a Key Activist is
scheduled to speak oncampus, in addition to the coverage of
his appearance, they should determine through established
sources the amount received by him and the source of the funds.

The purpose of this is (1) to provide for a central-
ized reporting of New Left activity in this field; (2) to
enable us to keep abreast of funds utilized to finance these
inflammatory speeches; (3) to enable us to take advantage of
situations which could embarrass the New Left or stifle

‘uture activity; (4) to facilitate the necessary evaluation and
analysis by the Bureau and other interested agencies. By

letter dated 12/23/69 to all field offices, information concerning
financial aspects of the New Left were emphasized, and the

field was instructed to develop solid information concerning

the travelling of Key Activists.

By airtel to SAC, Albany, and all offices dated

study of the whole New Left movement. Offices were instructed
to prepare summary reports on the New Left movement in their
territories. The purpose of these reports was to obtain a
Comprehensive study of the movement in order to assess its
potential dangerousness. Following the submission of the
original summary reports, offices were instructed to submit such
reports on a quarterly basis with an appropriate breakdown of
the materiai in the report; These reports. enable the Bureau to
inaintain recent and comprehensive informati on concerning various
aspects of the New Left movement, These reports. are disseminated

By letter dated 11/5/68, to SAC, Albany, and all
offices, under the caption of "New Left Movement, Publications,
Internal Security - Miscellaneous," the field was instructed
to cover the principal propaganda milis of the New Left which
are described as the "underground" newspapers. The field was
instructed to conduct a detailed survey of these publications
and to submit information concerning these obscene, seditious
and inflammatory newspapers. At the present time, there are
over 200 such publications being circulated, Cases on various
of these newspapers which are deemed important to the New Left
movement have been opened.

: By airtel dated 3/16/70 to all offices, a survey
was instituted to determine. the amount of financial support
given to New Left groups by tax-exempt charitable foundations,
prominent or wealthy individuals, and politically oriented groups.
The field was instructed to furnish results of this survey in
form suitable for dissemination,

By letter to all Special Agents in Cuerge, dated
2/13/70, the field was advised that the militant and violence-
prone Weatherman faction of the SDS planned to go underground
and to direct "strategic sabotage" at military and police
installations. The field was instructed to advise appropriate
local police agencies of the aims of the Weatherman faction and
of the necessity to vigorously investigate the Weatherman group.

By airtel to all field offices dated 3/19/70 the
field was advised of the plans of the Weatherman faction of
the SDS to form commando-type units to engage in bombing, arson
and assassination. The field was instructed to makeeery effort
to locate and identify Weatherman communes and their activists.
A list of major Weatherman activists was furnished to the field
which instructed intensive investigation to determine their
whereabouts and to advise the Bureau and office of origin on a
weekly basis. The field was instructed to utilize a caution
statement that Weatherman activists should be considered dangerous
for their known propensity for violence.

Bureau airtel to select offices handling bulk of

_ Weatherman investigations dated 3/24/70 reiterated instructions
in airtel to all offices 3/19/70 and specifically noted that
New Left communes were to be located and participants identified
to determine if they were violence prone. The offices were

data regarding involvement of subversive groups or individuals
: suspected in the incident as well as a recommendation for any
| additional investigation warranted,

fFeletype to all SACs 4/17/70 set forth specific
areas of investigations to be covered by field in its
investigations against New Left terrorist groups and
individuals ‘and also set forth the definition of a commune
for purposes of Bureau investigations and instructed field
to conduct sufficient investigation of all members of the
commune when they are members of a commune falling within
“Bureau standardsfor investigation. The field also was
instructed to develop that informant coverage necessary of
all communes and/or groups so that advance knowledge of
any planned violence could be obtained to insure preventive action
be initiated amd prosecutive action broughtto bear where
possible. a :

By airtel to all offices 5/11/70 the field was
authorized to interview all Venceremos Brigade (VB) members
on SAC authority on completion of investigation except in

Bureau airtel to all offices 5/13/70 instructed
the field to begin implementation of investigations of
New Left terrorism promptly with available manpower and
scale of implementation should be as rapid as possible. All
adherents to Weatherman ideology of advocating a Marxist-
Leninist revolution now and use terroristic tactics in
furtherance of revolution are to be subjects of these
investigations. All of these subjects are to be considered
for Priority I of the Security Index, interviewed and the
Bureau advised every 45 days by letter of those placed in
Priority I of their current residence and any other pertinent
information developed. To facilitate handling at the Bureau, :
all reports and other communications within defined categories
are to include word (Weatherman) in character, This airtel
also instructed each office to submit monthly airtel beginning
6/1/70 setting forth (1) identities and locations of communes
or organizations under investigation; (2) number of cases opened
during month on individuals in these categories; (3) total
number of individual cases under investigation; (4) informant
coverage used against communes or organizations; and, (5) brief
summary of New Left-oriented violence in area during preceding
month and action taken.

i Bureau airtel to all offices dated 5/15/70 concerning
the VB instructed all offices to immediately intensify
investigations of all returnees from Cuba with this Brigade,
ascertain their whereabouts, conduct prompt interviews and
submit current reports with Security Index recommendation.

In view of rebuttable presumption of at least sympathy to a
violent Marxist-Leninist revolution and willingness to
participate in that revolution by these VB members, the field
was also instructed for one year to advise the Bureau every
90 days of whereabouts and activities of Priority II and III
and non-Security Index returnees, In case of Priority I
Security Index subjects, this information is to be furnished
the Bureau every 45 days.

SAC Letter 70-30 (D) dated 6/2/70 reiterated
prior instructions of moratorium on Security Matter -
Communist investigations. Recent field inspections
| indicated some offices needed clarification of this
moratorium. The SAC Letter noted instructions concerning
moratorium only applied to routine communist investigations
and not those individuals belonging to such groups as the

Weatherman, Progressive Labor Party, Socialist Workers Party
and Young Socialist Alliance.

Bureau airtel to all offices 7/16/70 noted that
New Left terrorism is continuing through bombings, arsons
and other forms of violence and each SAC must personally
insure sufficient personnel are assigned to handle these
matters as well as investigating individuals inyolved and
those following Weatherman ideology of utilization of
violent revolutionary tactics against our Government.

Bureau airtel to select offices dated 8/20/70
handling Key Activists were instructed to promptly submit
to thé Bureau sufficient LaudWriving specimens of cach
Key Activist and the specimen is to be placed in the
National Security File maintained by the Laboratory. This
was done in view of the propensity for violence of these
individuals and the fact a number of them are currently
Bureau fugitives.

, SAC Letter 70-46 dated 9/1/70 captioned "New Left
Movement - Violence, Internal Security - Miscellaneous
(Weatherman)" refers to strategic sabotage plans of
Weatherman against military and police installations and
eclaration of War" by Weatherman underground and instructs
all security personnel to develop better informant coverage.
This development should concern informants and sources who
can furnish advance information regarding activities of
Weatherman and other terrorist groups and was specifically
stressed.

investigation must be immediately instituted and informants
directed to develop full facts concerning the attack, The

purpose of these investigations is to obtain complete
intelligence data concerning any extremist influence.

SAC Letter 70-48 (B) dated 9/15/70 under caption
"New Left and Black Extremist Terrorism - Informant Coverage"
instructed the field to immediately institute an aggressive
policy of developing new productive informants who can
infiltrate the ranks of terrorist organizations, their
collectives, communes and staffs of their underground newspapers.
Constructive plans to implement this program are to be
included in Item 4 of the monthly airtel on "New Left Movement—
Le uycralt which was outlined in Bureau airtel to all offices
5/13/70.

Bureau airtel to all offices 10/1/70 instructed the
field to replace the word (Weatherman) as noted in Bureau
airtel to all offices 5/13/70 with the word (Extremist). This
was done to insure prompt and efficient routing at the Bureau
as well as proper handling in the field. A new Ley
statement was also to be included in all corresp
respect to those individuals involved in Weatherman and other
New Left extremist activities,

SAC Letter 70-57 (C) dated 10/13/70 captioned "New
Left Movement - Police Training Matters" advised the field

_that in view of recent developments concerning violence caused

by New Left terrorists, the Bureau will consider requests

from the field for SACs or ASACs to brief local law enforcement
command and supervisory personnel regarding New Left extremism
and violence at law enforcement meetings and conferences where
attendance is restricted to full-time duly~ constituted law
enforcement officials.

Bureau airtel to all offices dated 11/3/70 advised
the field that the moratorium of suspension of report writing
in Priority II Security Index cases and suspension of
verification of residence and employment in Priority II and
Priority III cases is rescinded. Offices were instructed to
reopen a proportionate number of cases each month and insure
all were open by 6/30/71. Furthermore, residence and
employment on all of these subjects is to be verified, annual
reports submitted in Priority II cases and LHM submitted in
Priority III cases where necessary.

Bureau airtel to all offices dated 11/4/70
instructed the field to initiate investigation of all members
of SDS and members of pro-communist, militant New Left-type

‘ campus organizations who follow SDS advocacy of revolution
and violence. Each individual under investigation should be
considered for the Security Index.

- Bureau airtel to all offices dated 11/5/70 concerning
informant development in New Left groups noted that each SAC
was to make this matter his personal concern in order that
penetration of these groups by top quality informants will

be accomplished in the immediate future. Each SAC was
directed to submit to the Bureau by 11/13/70 a complete
analysis of his informant coverage in New Left groups clearly
setting forth the weaknesses and productive steps being taken
to rectify these weaknesses.

Current Bureau instructions require development of
adequate informant coverage of Strategie Air Command and
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Bases of the United Statdés
Air Force (PROSAB) to insure that our investigative
responsibilities in the sabotage, espionage and internal
security fields can be properly discharged. Semiannual reports
are submitted by each office havinga Strategic Air Command Base
or an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Base within its
territory. A review of semiannual reports submitted by the
field as of 7/1/70 disclosed that a total of_1,281 informants
have been developed.

Bureau airtel to all offices dated 9/9/70 advised field
that special single fingerprint file on Weatherman fugitives and
other New Left terrorists has been started, Field is instructed
to immediately review files for identity of individuals who fit
category of a New Left terrorist and whosefingerprints should be
included in this special single fingerprint file. Names of these
individuals were to be submitted to Bureau with. sufficient
identifying data and as new names come to attention of office
promptly furnish the Bureau. 7

Survey Regarding Potential for Racial Violence

This survey program was formerly under the title
"Possible Racial Violence, Major Urban Areas." The program
was initiated in 1964 in order that the Bureau would be aware
of potential danger spots in the U. 5, The present program
requires each field division to conduct a continuing survey in
their respective territories covering all localities having a
potential for racial violence based on current racial conditions.
The objective is to insure that the Bureau receives a realistic
and comprehensive picture of existing racial conditions in these
areas on a current basis and to obtain advance information of any
impending racial developments which clearly point to the
possibility of mob violence.

Quarterly reports submitted by field in line with this
survey represent information obtained through contacts with
local government and police officials, leaders of racial groups,
and a cross section of informants and sources. The survey
enables us to be thoroughly knowledgeable of racial develop~
tents and potential trouble spots and provides timely and
pertinent information which is disseminated to the White
House, Attorney General, and other Government agencies.
Information developed is also used for an analysis of the
potential for violence in the U. S., which is prepared in the
.spring of each year, just prior to the most active months,
in this field, and which is disséminated on a high level.

Emergency Detentior! Program

The Emergency Detention Program (EDP), which is field-wide,
involves the planning for apprehension and detention of persons
considered potentially dangerous to the national defense and public
safety of the U. S. in time of a national emergency and for the
search and seizure of contraband. The EDP is not a program as
such but is based on Title Il of the Internal Security Act CISA)
of 1950. The basic responsibility for the operation and implementa-
tion of the EDP rests with the Attorney General. Detailed plans
regarding the EDP are drawn up and included in the "Attorney
General's Portfolio," copies of which are in the Bureau's possession.

This program has been maintained in an up-to-date status.
' Administrative plans for the implementation of the program in each
office are maintained in the form of a "Detpro Survey." Lists of
individuals to be detained are furnished to the Internal Security
Division of the Department each month and the listing of places to
be searched under authority of the Master Search Warrant are main-
tained on a current basis. The Seat of Government and all field
divisions, with the exception of Honolulu, maintain essential
records at safe locations for successiul impiemeniation of the EDP.
Each office also maintains instructions to be turned over to the
U. S, Attorneys and U. S. Marshals upon implementation.

This program is coordinated by Special Records Unit,

Research Section. Primary responsibility rests with the Departmert
and changes can be made only upon approval of the Department. We
merely recommend and/or suggest any desirable changes. Periodic
checks are made to insure that all records connected with the EDP,
stored away from Headquarters cities, are current. Field division
surveys are kept up to date and the Bureau is advised semiannually
of the status.

~ Legislation was previously introduced in Congress to
repeal Title II of the ISA of 1950, When the 91st Congress ended,
no affirmative action had been taken in this regard. In the event
Title II shouldbe repealed at a future date under new legislation,
the Government's inherent right to protect itself internally will
continue to be safeguarded by the Bureau under its basic responsibil-
ity for protecting this Nation's internal security.

This program is under constant supervision and
‘re-evaluation so that any necessary changes and streamlining
may be made, A memorandum justifying the continuance of this
program was last submitted on 1/12/71.

Security Informants

Special Records Unit maintains an up-to-date index of
Security Informants and Potential Security Informants. it
correlates personal and operating data (such as name, address,
code, file and symbol number) concerning these informants,
which it receives from the Division's investigative sections,
and places such material on FD-348s, three by five cards
that constitute the index. This index is maintained on
discontinued as well as current informants.

At the time of the inspection in April, 1970, a total
of 1,141 Security Informants were being operated. AS of 1/12/71.
_ the number had increased to 1,159 for a total increase of 18,
During the same period, the number of Potential Security Informants
had increased from 616 to 765 for a total increase of 149,

Technical and Microphone Surveillances

There has been no significant change regarding the
utilization of these techniques in the internal security field
Since the last inspection. As of 1/12/71, we have 40 telephone
surveillances (tesurs) in Bureau's internal security ¢ cases and
Seven awaiting installation. We also have six tesurs in
operation at the request of the State Department.

We are conducting six microphone surveillances (misurs)
in internal security field, and four misur installations are
being operated at the request of the National Security Agency
(NSA). In addition, 64 teletype facilities are being covered at
the written request of NSA,

DESECO PROGRAM
Bufile 105-71688

The Deseco Program (program for development of
selected contacts to be directed against Soviet-bloc
officials) was conceived in an espionage conference in
December, 1957, Its objective was to intensify the
development of informants and double agents to penetrate
Soviet-bloc intelligence and for use in sensitive defection
approaches,

Between the last inspection and December 1, 1970,
approximately an 8-month period, 37) Deseco subjects were
placed in contact with Soviet-bioé © officials and 8 of these
have developed to the status of security informants or
double agents.

The majority of work is concentrated in the
New York, Washington, D. C,, and Chicago areas where Soviet-
bloc establishments are located. A Soviet Consulate General
is scheduled to becone operative in San Pranciscs during
1971, and a skeleton staff of four Soviet officials with
five dependents is seeking appropriate buildings for this
establishment,

San Francisco and other West Coast offices are
currently developing a "pool" of Deseco sources for eventual
use against Soviet intelligence officers who will operate out

-of the Soviet Consulate General, Due to the increased number

of Soviet-bloc personnel in the United States and their
relative freedom of travel, particularly to technical and
scientific conventions, a total of 19 offices have been
authorized to conduct "“sounding-out" interviews of prospective
sources without prior Bureau authority. Follow-up interviews
with potential Deseco sources are conducted on a UACB basis,
Unusual and highly sensitive cases are routed to the division
front office for approval.

i The New York, Washington Field and Chicago Offices
submit monthly progress letters summarizing the results of the
program, The other 16 offices submit summaries on a semi~
annual basis. This program substantially assists us to
penetrate and neutralize Soviet=-bloc intelligence, The results
achieved thus far warrant the program's continuance. It is

limitations on other sensitive investigative techniques. It
affords us a pool of human resources available for use against
Soviet~bloc intelligence personnel in political, economic and
particularly scientific fields in which the intelligence services
of the bloc have shown extreme interest. This program has been
reevaluated on an annual basis, It was last justified by
memorandum dated 10/22/69, but by the action of the Executive
Conference approved by the Director on memorandum of 10/29/70,
Washington and New York were instructed that every Special Agent
in those offices handling investigations of Soviet personnel
should immediately open on and develop two completely new
Deseco subjects. These instructions were Sent to the field

by airtel of 11/2/70.

The program will next be justified by memorandum in
March, 1971, when progress letters summarizing the results of
the program will be due from all participating offices, This
program is correlated in the Espionage Section Coordination

EAST-WEST EXCHANGE PROGRAM

4-H

This Program originated in 1955 to provide
internal security safeguards regarding the admission
of Soviet and satellite nationals. Soviet intelligence
| regards visits of the East-West Exchange Agreement
| participants as opportunities to promote intelligence
| activity.

As a result of the last inspection SAC Letter 70-25
was prepared which set forth revisions of our investigative
action in the field. This change was made as a result of
other manpower commitments. The instructions in that SAC
Letter provided that no investigations will be conducted
of groups or individuals participating in the East~West
Exchange Program in the absence of any information indicating
affiliation with Soviet intelligence. Bufiles are checked on
all Soviet participants and where information is developed
showing intelligence affiliation, cases are then opened and a
the field is instructed to conduct the necessary investigation.

During the period of June~December, 1970, 525
individuals entered the United States under the provisions
of this exchange agreement and of this number, we had information
indicating Soviet intelligence affiliation on 28 of these
individuals.

With regard to Soviet exchange students there are
currently 31 in the United States. Based on information
furnished by defector sources and investigations of Soviet
students previously in the United. States,we have determined
that the Soviet Intelligence Services utilizes these students
in an intelligence capacity, principally as "spotters." In
view of this, we afford these students active investigation.

We have also found that a number of these students return to

the United States for assignment at one of the Soviet establish-
ments and in most instances, contacts which they made while in
the United States as students are generally reactivated. For
example, Mikhail Fomichev, currently assigned to the Soviet
Mission to the United Nations as a Third Secretary, was in the
United States as an exchange student in 1966. Through a defector
source we learned that he had recruited a fe

central repository for information developed in connection
with investigations of Soviets in this country pertaining to
radio and technical equipment purchased by them.

mation developed concerning these purchases on a monthly basis.
Dissemination of the material is made to Department of State,
Central Intelligence Agency, Army, Navy, Air Force, Atomic
Energy Commission, and Bureau of International Commerce,
United States Department of Commerce. Material submitted
includes name of Soviet purchaser, date, quantity, description
and cost of the items purchased. It involves maintenance of
three control files; one each at Bureau, Washington Field and
New York Offices. Program established to acnieve following
objectives: disseminate to interested Government agencies
information concerning purchase of technical equipment in the
United States by Soviet officials; determine whether Soviet
intelligence is circumventing restrictions regarding material
appearing on Department of Commerce restricted export control
list; and to permit discreet markings by FBI _Laboratory of

3. Since April, 1970, Program has disclosed continuing
purchases by Soviet nationals of Grundig Satellite Multiband
portable radios. During 9/70 one KGB officer in Washington
purchased 30 of these radios at one time. Soviet husband

and wife illegal team recently in U. S. used one of these

radios to receive clandestine broadcasts from USSR which con-
tained their operating instructions. Program made it possible
to secure serial numbers for possible future identification.
Analysis of purchases enables Laboratory to make reasonable
estimate of internal communications used at Soviet establishments
and security devices being operated. Program also disclosed type
of transmitting equipment and antenna system purchased by
Soviets, apparently for installation at ComulateGeneral in

San Francisco when that establishment becomes operational. This
information is of interest not only to FBI Laboratory but to
State Department and National Security Agency in connection with
its worldwide coverage of Soviet communications capabilities.

PROGRAM

VISITORS TO COMMUNIST CHINA AND
CONTACTS BY UNITED STATES RESIDENTS
OF CHINESE DIPLOMATIC ESTABLISHMENTS 4-H
(Bufile 105-144424)

1. Background, Date of Inception, Scope and Desired Objectives.

Program was initiated in 8/65 in connection with
efforts to cover Chinese Communist (Chicom) activities in
the United States. Through cooperation of both United States
intelligence agencies and friendly foreign intelligence services,
, the identities of United States residents are furnished to us
who attempt to enter Communist China or contact People's
of China (PRC) dinlomatic establishments in certain
es throughout the world,

oO

This program is field-wide and not directly connected
with any other investigative program. The objectives include
identifying those individuals who enter the PRC and who may be
engaged in Chicom activities in their contacts with Chicom
establishments, The identity of these visitors is absolutely

. necessary in order to determine if they have access to classified
material or if they could be utilized effectively by the Chicoms
when they return to the United States. Some of these individuals
have excellent potential for informant development. We have
utilized contacts with Chicom diplomatic establishments in the
development of selected sources who are attractive to the Chicoms
and have been developed as double agents. By SAC Letter No.
70-26 dated 5/12/70, we restricted our investigations to cover
actual visitors to China. This procedure was initiated to
conserve manpower inasmuch as State Department had relaxed travel
restrictions to China on 3/16/70 in order to allow travel to
PRC for any “legitimate purpose." The President recently directed
that a committee prepare recommendations for additional steps
which may be taken to relax restrictions on travel to and promote
further trade with the PRC. This highly confidential directive,
if accepted, will permit many people to be eligible to travel to
China ifthe Chinese will grant travel permits. Up to the present
time, however, the Chicoms have only granted travel permits to
pro-Chicom propagandists such as Edgar Snow,

2, Positive Results Achieved Since Last Inspection,

va

Investigations since the last Inspection have totaled
95, Many of these individuals were interviewed; however, it
has been determined that none were allowed to enter Communist
China. During the cultural revolution which ended during 1970,
very few United States residents were allowed to enter
Communist China including a number of United Nations employees
who had previously made numerous trips to Communist China.
There is every indication, however, that the Chicoms have taken
on a "new look" internationally and are attempting to gain the
‘friendship of the western world, This program has not reached
its great potential due to the xenophobia which existed during
the past three years, Communist China is expected to open an
embassy at Ottawa, Canada, in 1/71 as result of Canadian
recognition, This will make it far easier for United States
residents to cross the border into Canada and either seek a
travel permit to visit Communist China or make contact with

Chtcaom = Witconce roorescntativyes a embassy in 9
Chicom intelligence represcntatives at the embas in Ottawa.

3. Extent and Nature of Current Supervision.

This program is handled by one Bureau supervisor who
correlates information as received from either United States
intelligence agencies or friendly foreign intelligence services
and directs the office covering the individual's residence and
employment to conduct necessary investigation according to the
Manual of Instructions, Investigations are conducted to fully
identify the individuals, determine current residence and
employment and ascertain whether he has access. to classified
information, In absence of any unusual circumstances indicating
need for further action, the case is closed. Each case is
closely supervised and evaluated on its individual merits.

4. Current Justification for Continuation,

The potential of this program is far greater than
what has been realized in the way of results to date. As
mentioned above, the Canadian recognition of the PRC has given
Communist China a foothold in North America. _RCMP_advises..,
that they feél that 50 percent of the Chinese Communist |
intelligence effort Will be directed toward ‘the United States.

NW 55151 DociId:32989638 Page 462



At the present time, the restrictions for crossing the border
from the United States to Canada are practically nonexistent
for a United States resident with proper documentation, There-
fore, it is imperative that we continue such a program so that

when RCMP reports individuals contacting the PRC Embassy in
Ottawa we may fully identify ese “radividia 5 aiesiaaeiinenmeiieaiod

the program would be evaluated and justified during 1/71;
this is currently being undertaken.

CHINESE ALIENS ENTERING THE UNITED STATES 4-H
(Bufile 105-135923)

2

CHINESE ENTERING THE UNITED STATES
CLAIMING UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP
(Bufile 105-12752)

These two programs have similar criteria for
investigation and, therefore, are being handled under
one write~up.

1. Background, Date of Inception, Scope and Desired Objectives

The alien program was instituted on 1/26/65
and the program concerning Chinese entering the United States
claiming United States citizenship began on 9/14/65.
-Both programs were originated in an effort to identify
Chinese Communist (Chicom) intelligence operatives who
may be sent to the United States in deep cover. In 1955,
Chicom intelligence emphasized the need to deploy deep
cover illegal agents abroad and specifically in the
United States. The number of cases currentlyinvestigated under
the citizen program has been approximately 15 to 20 annually;
only one, however, has been opened since last inspection.
These individuals offer the Chicoms an ideal situation for
placing an illegal into the United States who has assumed the
_ identity of a Chinese whose father or grandfather was a
United States citizen. These individuals, once they arrive in
the United States, are never checked on by any agency. The
Chinese aliens, a number of whom are students "temporarily,"
entering the United States to attend universities, have
decreased in number during the past two years from approximately
.2,000 per month to 600 per month. Recent relaxation of immigra-
tion regulations will now permit a great increase in the numbers
allowed to enter the United States during 1971. Since the
inception of both programs, we have simplified the criteria for
investigating citizens and aliens keeping in mind the necessity
for conserving manpower in our investigations, but also
fulfilling our responsibilities. The scope and investigation
of these two programs are identical. The prime objective of
these two programs is the.identification of intelligence agents;
however, the two programs have been responsible for the
development of positive intelligence information as well as a
continuing increase in source coverage of Chinese matters, not
only in our heavily populated Chinese localities, but also
covering the lesser Chinese communities throughout the
United States.

2. Positive Results Achieved Since the a Inspection
T

Since the last inspection 151 cases have been
opened on Chinese aliens and only one case on Chinese
claiming United States citizenship. During this period
197 alien cases have been closed and eight cases involving
citizens were closed. Information developed during these
investigations has been disseminated to the intelligence
community. To date, no Chicom intelligence agent has been
uncovered by these two programs; however, we have steadily
increased our source coverage and collected positive intelli-
gence which has been disseminated to the intelligence
community. This is a long-range program and it is expected
it will pay dividends during the coming year with the establish-
ment of a Chinese Communist embassy in Canada.

3. Extent and Nature of Current Supervision

The alien cases, most of which originate from our

Legat in Hone Kong, are supervised by three supervisors
accuruiig vo vac gSographic location the alien is

destined to in the United States. The citizen cases are
also supervised by three supervisors according to
geographic location and these cases are furnished to us as
a result of Passport Records being checked by WFO.

Cases in both programs are closely supervised to make
certain that each subject falls within the criteria and that
when the cases are reopened for investigation after two

- years the case is evaluated to determine if the subject

may possibly be an intelligence agent,

4, Current Justification for Continuation

These two programs cover two vulnerable areas
‘whereby the Chicoms could penetrate the United States by
utilizing either aliens or individuals claiming United States
citizenship who have been fully trained in Communist China
and entered Hong Kong subsequent to 1/1/55, The screening
process at United States Consulate General's office in
Hong Kong is meager and current proposals for relaxation
of rules will make it easier for the Chicoms to filter
agents into the United States through the easiest route,
that is, an alien or a citizen fully documented, ‘These two
programs also are one of the best sources for the
development of informants and the gathering of positive
intelligence information. These programs are fully justified

for continuation and no additional manpower or expenditure
requests are needed at this time for the continuation of

these two programs.

5. Frequency of Evaluation and Date of Last Justification

These programs are evaluated annually. The
alien program was last justified on 1/22/70 and the citizen
program will be justified with the alien program on 1/22/71.
On 9/18/70, a memorandum was submitted indicating that the
citizen program would be coordinated with and justified
with the alien program during January, 1971.

Extent and Nature of Current Supervision

Periodic reports on individuals and organizations
as well as informant coverage relating to BOCOV are analyzed
and correlated by SA Joseph EB, Gauzens, Jr. Involved is
review of incoming letters, memoranda, ‘reports and semi-
annual progress letters detailing informant coverage and
subversive strength. Analysis of this material provides a
basis for detecting weaknesses and making arrangements for
counter~intelligence moves. :

Cutbacks initiated by the Bureau for the purpose
of conserving manpower and streamlining operations have
substantially reduced manpower and number of informants
utilized. Agents and Legal Attaches participating were
reduced from 16 to 12; informants and sources utilized
from 312, t0,212., These reductions resulted in annual
savings of $19,934.65 and total manpower currently utilized
on the program is 1.72 Agents. Effectiveness of BOCOV and
our ability to re-~expand the program should future
circumstances warrant were not impaired by the cutbacks
cited.

Current Justification for Continuance

BO@OV continues to fill the above-described
intelligence void and, in addition, is coordinated with

NAME CHECKS OF ALIENS HOLDING DIPLOMATIC AND
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION VISAS

: !

This program was initiated in January, 1952, as a means of
keeping the Attorney General advised of information of a subversive
nature relating to the diplomats and officials of foreign countries entering
the United States in official capacities. These data are required by the
Attorney General to assist in discharging his responsibilities under the
Immigration and Nationality Act for exclusion and/or deportation of
foreign officials where their activity requires such action.

The basis for this program is found in the procedure by
Immigration and Naturalization Service in its submission of a form
advising of the arrival of the alien officials in this country, which form is
sent to member agencies of the intelligence community. The separate
agencies perform name checks on the data in these forms with the results
being channelized toe the FRI. We correlate this information with data.
from our files and furnish same to the Attorney General. In those
instances where additional investigation appears warranted, we obtain
clearance from Department of State and issue appropriate instructions
to the field for active investigation.

: Since the program was initiated, 617,290 Immigration and
Naturalization Service forms have been processed and we have
undertaken 452 investigations based on results thereof.

The program continues to supplement our overall coverage in
the intelligence field with the majority of the work being handled by
trained clerical personnel within the Nationalities Intelligence Section
and some isolated instances of involved investigations being handled by
substantive desk supervisors within the Division. Based on the limited
number of active investigations opened since the inception of this program,
the cost of the program consists mainly of name check expenditures. The
program continues to serve a necessary purpose in our overall intelligence
coverage, serving to alert us to the presence in this country of persons
having a capability for intelligence activities or who may pose a security

. threat to the United States. .

The program is justified annually, with the last justification
having been made February 9, 1970.

SECURITY INDEX - CUBA ‘
(Bufile 100-358086-210) +

Background and Date of Inception

This program was instituted in November, 1960.
By that date it was obvious that Cuba, whose Government
had been taken over by Fidel Castro in January, 1959,
was a communist state posing a real and present threat
to the internal security of the U. S. In 1962, at the
time of the Cuban missile crisis, a Supervisor at the
Bureau was asSigned the specific responsibility for
administering this program to assure the apprehension and
special handling of the individuals included therein in

the event of a limited emergency involving Cubs.
Scope and Desired Objectives

As of 12/15/70, there were 419 individuals
included in the Security Index - Cuba Program, divided
into two categories:

1. Individuals placed on the Security Index
solely on account of their pro-Cuban activities. (Cuban
Special Section - 96 persons).

2. Persons already on the Security Index
because of other subversive connections and activity who
would warrant special attention in the event of hostilities
with Cuba (Security Index subjects tabbed "Pro-Cuban" -
slate individuals). 7

Program is designed to maintain an up-to-date
record of location and activities of individuals included
therein, by means of established Security Index procedures
and reporting, in order that we are in a position to move
swiftly should the apprehension or special handling of
these persons become necessary.

Positive Results Achieved

Determination as to the validity of an individual's
inclusion in this program is constantly under review. Since
the last inspection, critical attention has been given this
matter with the result that the number of persons on the
Cuban Special Section of the Index has been reduced from
193 as of 3/16/70 to 96 as of 12/15/70. These 96 persons
are judged to be the hard-core pro-Cubans, action against
whom in a Cuban emergency would be mandatory. Of these 96,
27 are Cuban aliens. Each subject of pending security
investigation with Cuban ramifications is considered for
inclusion in the Index.

Extent and Nature of Current Supervision

The Supervisor responsible for this program is
required to review each investigative communication in
current cases of pro~Cuban individuals to determine whether
the individual meets the criteria for inciusion in the Indox,
as outlined in the Manual of Instructions. He must make a
decision as to the degree of dangerousness of the individual
j under the Priority Apprehension Program and rule on the
! field's recommendations regarding these matters. He initiates

procedures with the Security Index Desk of the Domestic
Intelligence Division and the Voucher Statistical Section
of the Administrative Division regarding the placing of an
individual on the Index, his removal, and assignment or
change in Priority.

If the individual involved is an alien,
correspondence with the Internal Security Division of the
Department is required to assure the preparation of a pre-
positioned arrest warrant by Immigration and Naturalization
1 Service. Action is also taken with the Department to cancel
the arrest warrant if the alien is removed from the Index.

On 10/29/70, the Director approved the lifting of

’ the moratorium on report writing and certain investigative
procedures in security cases on individuals. This will
require the field to reopen by 6/30/71 and conduct investi-
gation in cases on some 372 individuals involved in this
program who have not received recent investigative attention,
The Bureau will receive in the upcoming months summary
reports, letterhead memoranda and other communications in
virtually all of these cases. The moratorium, in effect

- ~2-
WH 5511 _Docld: 32989638 Page 478 00000



DocId: 32989638 Page 479

since February, 1969, has limited investigative and re-
porting activity in this field. As of 1/11/71 there were
18 active and 78 inactive case in the Cuban Special
Section of the Security Index (19% of the 96 case total)
and at the time of the last inspection there were 25
active and 168 inactive cases (13% of the 193 case total),

Current Justification

The threat to the internal security of the U. S,
from communist Cuba has not lessened in recent years. A
workable priority apprehension system which receives
current and continuing attention is mandatory. Instant
program, as presently organized and handled, is fully
justified.

Frequency of Evaluation and Date of Last Evaluation.
This program is evaluatéd on a semi-annual basis.

The most recent semi-annual review and evaluation was
dated 10/8/70.



AMERICAN REPATRIATE PROGRAM

BACKGROUND AND DATE OF INCEPTION - Program was instituted
on February 28, 1962, to specify procedure to be followed
upon receipt of information that U. S.Gitizen, residing in
Cuba had been issued a Swiss Protection Passport by Swiss

lining investigation to be conducted relative to individual
eepatriates.

SCOPE AND DESIRED OBJECTIVES ~ Specific objectives of program
are verification of repatriate's identity; ascertaining
whether the individual has or had Cuban intelligence contact,
training or assignment, or possesses intelligence infor-
mation; and instructing individuals to alert us to any future
intelligence contact. Program is field wide.

POSITIVE RESULTS ACHIEVED - From August, 1969, to July, 1970,
eleven flights brought an average of 18 citizens out of Cuba
per flight. These repatriates were accompanied by a total

of 425 relatives and/or close friends, all of whom were

Cuban aliens. Some 300 U. S. citizens remain in Cuba awaiting
repatriation. There have been no repatriation flights since
July 31, 1970. : :

Program has alerted us to return to this country
of Security Index subjects, Castro sympathizers, individuals
who ‘traveled to Cuba without State Department authorization
and individuals affiliated with Communist Party, USA. Asa
result of interviews conducted with repatriates, worthwhile
data concerning conditions in Cuba has been obtained and
disseminated to the U. S, Intelligence Community.

EXTENT AND NATURE OF CURRENT SUPERVISION - Program is

Supervised by one Seat of Government Agent who devotes a
portion of his time. All cases are afforded careful
supervision in an effort to detect presence of a repatriate
who may have been recruited by the Cuban Intelligence
Service for activity in this country. Thirty-two cases are
pending.

CURRENT JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUANCE - Fidel Castro has
consistently used the mass exodus of individuals from Cuba
to infiltrate intelligence agents into the U, 8. Program
offers excellent potential for detecting such individuals
who reenter this country under the protective coverage of
their citizenship. We feel that the program is fully
justified.

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE SECTION i

RACIAL MATTERS

Racial matters investigations were intensified through
establishment of the Racial Intelligence Section on 10/2/67.
This Section handles racial matters investigations involving
black extremist organizations and individuals. Objectives are
to identify organizations and individuals that are involved in
extremist activities, that advocate or had actually committed
or have conspired to commit acts of violence, that advocate
revolutionary or terrorist activities and that violate Federal
laws. The dangerousness to the United States of such individuals
must be assessed and a determination made as to whether they
should be included in the Security Index or the Agitator Index.
The extent. of foreign influence or influence of. the Communist

Party or other domestic revolutionary groups among racial

extremists, especially black extremist organizations, is a prime
objective. To accomplish these objectives, sources have been
developed who can furnish quality and timely information concern
individual extremists and extremist organizations. Such sources
likewise have forewarned us of potential violence and enabled

the Bureau to stay on top of the raciai situation. These

sources have assisted the Bureau in executing its responsibiliti

of alerting local authorities and to keep ‘other Government
agencies dependent upon us for information informed of
pertinent developments including information’ concerning
-potential violence.

Our informant coverage has made it possible for us
to keep a constant flow of information going to the White House,
the Attorney General and other Government agencies having an
interest. Additional information pertaining to- racial intelli-
gence matters and the survey regarding "Potential for Racial
Violence" is set forth under data furnished by the Research

Section.

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION INSPECTION

Reports submitted by the field are’ thoroughly
reviewed at the Seat of Government to insure that essential
information is being obtained on a timely basis and that
it is being promptly disseminated in the field, as well as
at the Seat of Government,

The Director on 11/27/70 in testimony before the
Senate Appropriation Committee for the purpose of securing
additional Special Agents emphasized again the violent and
revolutionary nature of the Black Panther Party (BPP). He
testified there has been an alarming increase in the number
of black extremist attacks against law enforcement officers;
BPP publications consistently advocate violence, including
assassination and kidnapings, to achieve overthrow of the
Establishment; BrP leaders have participated in crimes of
violence; and Black Panthers have substantial connections
with hostile foreign elements, notably the communist
regime in North Korea and Arab terrorists in Algeria.
Increasing ties between Arab terrorists and Black Panthers,
according to the Director, raise the ominous possibility
. that militants may seek to ape Arab tactics, including air-
: plane hijackings, to gain the release of jailed Panther
members.

BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT 4-H
Bufile 157-8415

'

Since 1/7/69 all offices have submitted semiannual
reports presenting concisely a complete picture of black
extremist activity in its area. This enabled us to identify
groups and individuals involved in black extremist activities,
to develope quality informants who report on such activities
and to initiate intensified and penetrative investigations of
such individuals and groups. Since the desired objectives
for which these reports were originally designed had been
realized, since field informs us on a timely basis insubstan-
tive cases of pertinent data concerning this movement and to
insure manpower is utilized on priority matters, the Director
on 7/6/70 authorized discontinuance of these reports.

On 3/8/69 the Black Nationalist Photographic Album
(BNPA) was established to assist in identification of militant
black extremists who travel extensively.

The BNPA is maintained in all offices. BNPA includes
a photograph and biographical data on leaders of black extremist
organizations and militant black nationalists who are know
totravel. Each office prepares a form on such individuals
within its territory and the form is then furnished to the
Bureau and all offices where it is maintained in a complete
album. In the event of travel by any of these individuals,
the office covering the area being visited already has.a.

photograph and biographical sketch of the individual immediately . |

available. The album is also furnished to the Legats in Ottawa
and Mexico City andto the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and
Central Intelligence Agency, in the event of foreign travel.
Over 300 extremists are currently carried in this album.

In view of importancé of an individual's fingerprint
classification for identification purposes, the field by letter
dated 5/8/70 was instructed to include such data in biographical

sketch concerning each individual included in the BNPA
and to amend those sketches then included in the Album
to show such data.

The BNPA was also broadened to include black
extremists who are Bureau fugitives. This insured each
office having a photograph and biographical sketch immediately
available for use in conducting investigation to locate such
fugitives or in apprehending them.

By SAC Letter 70-65, item (D), dated 11/17/70, the-
field was advised that, henceforth, deletions of individuals
from the BNPA would require Bureau authorization since Bureau
did not agree with some deletions made by field which resulted
in unwarranted action by all field offices.

To insure broad circulation among investigative
personnel and to serve as an avenue for greater utilization
of informants especially racial sources, we initiated the
Black Extremist Bureau Fugitives list in June, 1970. This
,list, which is prepared monthly and sent each field office
and selected Legats, identifies those Bureau fugitives who
by reason of their activities or organizational affiliations
are black extremists. Currently there are 45 fugitives carried
on the list, 9 of whom are 10 fugitives. Twenty of these
fugitives are reportedly living outside the U.S. This list
has given greater emphasis to the location of these fugitives,
particularly among Special Agents handling racial matters and
racial informants and has been effective in affording greater
exposure of these fugitives among racial informants. Fifteen
of these fugitives have been arrested since the list was
initiated, with 5 being arrested in December, 1970. One of
.those arrested in December is the reported leader of the
Black Panther Party (BPP) underground.

Racial Intelligence Section prepares monthly a
Racial Calendar pertaining to the Black Nationalist Movement
in this country. This Calendar identifies scheduled racial
events throughout the country which are more than local in
nature as well as all major scheduled events which could

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 486 fo-6



logically develop into a racial event. Purpose of the
Calendar is to assist field in coverage of these events in
view of widespread travel on the part of black nationalists af
in attendance at such affairs and to take part in demonstra-
tions commemorating certain anniversaries of interest to
blacks, A listing of recently published publications and
articles concerning the black nationalist movement is also
set forth in the Calendar. Publications included are public
source and are identified to assist the field in keeping on
top of writing by and about black nationalists and the black
nationalist movement.

Black extremist activities are concentrated in organizec
activities of over 66 groups, some of which have chapters in
major cities throughout this country, The violence-prone Black
Panther Party, for example, has 48 branches throughout U.S.
Hard-core membership in these black extremist groups totals
about 9600. This membership figure, however, disguises real
following of extremist groups in black areas of our cities
and extent: of influence and leadership they exercise. These
organizations, and particularly BPP, have substantial sympathetic
support, especially from young blacks, which is frequently
surfaced during confrontations with police.

Extent of black extremist strength is illustrated by
Louis Harris Poll which was set forth in 4/6/70 issue of "Time."
The Poll projects that nine percent of all blacks, some two
million Americans, call themselves "revolutionaries" and believe
only a '"'readiness to use violence" will achieve equality.
Twenty-five per cent have "a great deal" of respect for the
BPP. Most alarming is that 40 per cent of those in the age
group 14-21 years old believe violence is necessary ‘to achieve
equality.

The following pages set forth summaries concerning the
key black extremist organizations that are presently under
active and penetrative investigation.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY t 4H
: \

The Black Panther Party (BPP), a black extremist
organization, continues to be extremely active throughout
the country. Formed during late 1966 in Oakland, California,
for the obstensible purpose of patrolling the black community
to prevent alleged police brutality, it was originally known
as the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.

af It expanded rapidly throughout the United States
during 1967~68, then suffered a gradual decline during 1969.
Revitalized in December, 1969, and throughout the 1970s it

has gain currently expanded until today there are approximately
48 branches of the BPP with an estimated 1,000 hard-core
members supported by many thousands of sympathizers, It also
has an internationai office in Algiers, Algeria. The branches
include 17 chapters and 31 affiliated groups that masquerade
under the names of National Committee to Combat Fascism or
Black Community Information Center.

The ultimate goal of the BPP is the violent overthrow
of the United States Government-and its replacement with a
“Marxist-Leninist system. The BPP openly advocates urban
guerrilla warfare, assassination of Government leaders and
other forms of violent terrorism. Since its inception, the
BPP has aimed its most vicious invectives against law
enforcement and particularly local police. "Off the pigs,"
BPP jargon for "kill the cop" is the battle cry of the
organization, The weekly Panther newspaper, ''The Black Panther,"
and its other publications and propaganda paraphernalia are
abound with articles and cartoons encouraging lethal attacks |
against police and other forms of authority.

Our investigation of the BPP was instituted in 1967
and since that time has expanded as the organization itself
expanded. -

By letter to all offices dated 2/27/70, approved
by the Director, offices having BPP investigations were
instructed to submit intelligence reports on the BPP every
six months in compliance with instructions in the Manual of
Instructions. Previously offices were submitting quarterly
reports on the BPP. The changes made on the basis of a
recommendation by a Racial Informants Conference of field
supervisors to eliminate some paper work in the field.

All field offices having a BPP investigation are

‘also required to submit a monthly report containing evidentiary

data required by the Department. Original instructions in
this regard were issued by Bureau airtel 12/3/68 and the
continued submission of this monthly report is necessary in
view of possible prosecution of the BPP.

Ali field offices conducting an active BPP investi+
gation are required to submit a monthly airtel summary of the
status and activities of the BPP within its territory. This
survey was commenced as a biweekly summary in November, 1968,
and changed: to a monthly summary on the approval ‘of the
Director by letter to all offices dated 2/27/70. This change
is a result of a recommendation by the Racial Informants
Conference of field supervisors to cut down paper work in the
field. The monthly summary relieves the field of some paper
work and at the same time keeps the Bureau and the field up to
date on BPP developments.

San Francisco as office of origin in the BPP case
continues to submit a biweekly summary and analysis of the
BPP. Because of the excellence of this summary and the need
for such an analysis by the field, San Francisco was instructed
by Bureau airtel 1/21/70 to furnish copies of its summary to
all continental offices which is the current practice.

All field offices conducting an active BPP investi-~
gation were instructed by airtel 6/17/70 to submit a monthly
summary on the financial activities of each BPP branch. This
financial summary includes data on sources of income, foreign
funding, expenses, the mechanics of local finance operations,

NW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 489

a

and the steps being taken by each office to develop full
financial data. This summary enables the Bureau to keep
abreast of all financial developments regarding the BPP
on a national and international basis. :

By airtel to all continental offices 11/6/70 all
field offices conducting anative BPP investigation were
instructed to submit a biweekly airtel containing specific
comments regarding underground BPP operations within the
area of each field office. This includes progress in the
identity and interviewing of expelled BPP members who, it
has been determined, are the logical candidates for member~
ship in the BPP underground. The underground operation of
the BPP has an ultimate goal of terroristic guerrilla
warfare. It. is a recent development in the operation of
the BPP which is the subject of an intensive investigation.
The biweekly summary enables the Bureau to keep abreast of
ail developments in the underground and to intelligently
coordinate the investigation thereof, :

In recent.months the Black Panther Party has formed
a corporation known as Stronghold Consolidated Productions,
Inc. (SCPI) to control all BPP funds and assets and to act as
purchaser and/or lessee of any property utilized by the BPP.
The corporation and its activities are under intensive investi-
gation which has revealed that its activities are centered in
San Francisco and New York. By airtel 1/7/71 to San Francisco
and New York, these offices were instructed to submit a
weekly summary in form suitable for dissemination of all
pertinent developments concerning the corporation during the
previous week. This summary keeps the Bureau aware of SCPI
operations and also enables us to regularly fulfill our
dissemination requirements.

_ It is noted that there are currently 32 field offices
conducting active investigations of the BPP. Our intensive
investigation has enabled us to identify its leaders, members
and new branches. In addition, we have developed detailed
information concerning its operations and activities including

NW 55151 ‘DocId:32989638 Page 490 227



1

i : |
|

organization plans, funding programs, extent of control by
headquarters and foreign support. In addition, evidentiary
information that could support prosecution is regularly
furnished to the Department. ‘

Our ultimate objective is of course the prosecution
of the BPP for violations of Federal criminal, civil rights
and security statutes. A secondary objective is to more
completely develop details of the BPP for intelligence
purposes.

In July, 1969, the Attorney General established
a special task force for the specific purpose of developing
a prosecutive theory against the BPP, Attorneys of this
task force, known as the Special Interdivisional Unit, have
interviewed many of our informants in furtherance of this
purpose and hav instituted a continuing Federal Grand Jury
in San Francisco. Ten of our informants have testified
before this Federal Grand Jury and its is anticipated that
others will be called. :

It is recommended that the intensive investigation
of the BPP including all surveys and procedures outlined as
-above be continued.

CONGRESS OF AFRICAN PEOPLES (CAP)
157-16554

The CAP was formed as an international revolutionary
organization as the result of the convening of the fourth
annual gathering of black power advocates in the United States
in Atlanta, Georgia, September 3~7, 1970, This gathering
was unique in that it was attended by approximately 2,500
blacks of so-called moderate and militant persuasion, as well
as a large number of extremists. Representatives attended
from 35 states and 21 different nations, including Canada,
Australia, various independent nations of Africa, and the
Caribbean area,

: A number of the workshops at the CAP were dominated
by extremist elements who urged thecreation of massive coopera-
tive programs and institutions designed to destroy any progress
made toward integration of the races by complete rejection
of white society, the formation of a separatist black nation,
national African parties, and, ultimately, a World African
Party.

These objectives are to be achieved through the
unification, cooperation, and interdependence of blacks
wherever they reside, regardless of their "imposed" nationali~
ties, and under the revolutionary ideological banner of
Pan~Africanism of the well-known black extremist Stokely
Carmichael,

. Specifically, CAP's domestic extremist element,
headed by black revolutionaries Hayward, Henry and LeRoi, Joi =
from Newark, New Jersey, calls for extensive use of disruptive.
tactics against all segments of white-dominated institutions
and organizations, including the police and the military.

Since its founding in Atlanta, CAP has held a
number of regional meetings in various sections of the
United States for the purpose of setting up its national
organization and in furtherance of its revolutionary programs,
As a result, CAP is currently activating in at least 17
different cities with its national headquarters and Chairman
Hayward Henry located in Boston, Massachusetts. LeRoi Jones
however, appears to be the dominant figure in the organization,

Current CAP planning indicates the organization
intends to move aggressively through deceptive | programs

to establish black political power through four basic activities
which are:

Congress of African Peoples (CAP)

(1) influencing of black political candidates;
(2) organization of the black community;

(3) formation of coalitions with all dissident
and extremist groups whether white or black
so long as CAP benefits from same; and

(4) the massive use of disruptive tactics,

CAP has emerged as yet another deadly threat to
racial harmony and,as a result of its programs and ties with
foreign extremist elements and well-known revolutionary
Stokely Carmichael, must also be considered an imposing
threat to the national security.

Investigations of the CAP, its leaders, and extremist
affiliates are receiving most close supervision, Pertinent
data developed in regard to their activities is being
disseminated to the Department and to interested Government
agencies and officials,

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA 4-H
Bufile 157-9079

The Republic of New Africa (RNA), formed in
Detroit, Michigan in March, 1968 by followers of
Malcolm X, assassinated black extremist, has chapters
in ten U.S, cities and a current hard-core membership
of 100-130 individuals,

RNA was primarily formed by Milton and Richard
Henry, black extremists of long standing in the Detroit,
Michigan, area, When first formed, the RNA named as its
President in exile Robert Franklin Williams, violence-
prone black extremfst™then residng in Chind, Williams
has since returned to the U,S. but has resigned from his
position as head of the RNA due to his own legal problems
and dissension existing within the organization,

RNA was established to create a black nation
within the U.S, demanding from the U.S. Government the
) States of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and

South Carolina, in addition to individual reparations
_ of $10,000 per black citizen as payment for 400 years
of ancestral slave labor.

RNA's organizatiaal structure was designed to
be revolutionary in character and its founders proposed
_that efforts be made for international recognition and
financial assistance from Cuba, Red China and the black
nations of the world. RNA established a black army known
as the Black Legion whose duty was to protect the persons
and property and to attack the enemies (the police) of that
nation. Training programs were instituted and uniforms
complete with the leopard skin epaulets were disigned as
the official dress for the Black Legionnaires,

High point in the RNA's activities occurred

during a national convention in Detroit, Michigan, in
March 1969, when members of the Black Legion engaged in
armed confrontation with Detroit police resulting in the
death of one policeman and the serious wounding of another.

; STUDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE (SNCC)
100-439190

SNCC was originally organized in Atlanta, Georgia,
in 1960 under the name Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee. Prior to the election of Stokely Carmichael as
its Chairman in May, 1966, the organization Operated as a
nonmembership civil rights organization with both white and
black participation, Carmichael, on assuming the Chairmanship
of SNCC, immediately eliminated all whites from participation
and changed the organization from a civil rights-oriented
group to one whose aims were those of antiwhite revolutionary
action and the overthrow of the United States Government, a
position which the organization maintains today.

H. Rap Brown, Bureau fugitive and well-known black
extremist who served as National Chairman for a time following
Carmichael's vacating of that position in 1967, again assumed
the National Chairmanship of SNCC in the Summer of 1969, At
that time, it was announced SNCC was eliminating the word
Ul iolent" from its title. The organization's headquarters
also moved from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City.

we

Under Brown's direction, SNCC moved to restructure
and revitalize itself in an attempt to regain its prominence
as a black extremist organization, The national leadership
issued directives on the reorganization of the national
office in New York City, as well as the local organizations

.and the formation of councils to include a Revolutionary

Economic Council, an Armed Guerrilla Tactics Council, a
Research Council, and others which make up a body within SNCC
known as the Revolutionary Political Council,

Included among new organizational procedures are
plans for raising the number of active participants in local
cadres, the obtaining and training in the use of weapons,
the purchase of land for ostensible use in an Agrarian Reform
Plan to aid black tenant farmers but which will also serve
as a weapons training site, Training manuals on revolutionary
activities, including guerrilla warfare and the medical care
of wounded or injured persons, have been prepared and are to
be disseminated to local SNCC SmI shTSzi in furtherance of this
reorganization, 7

charges of inciting to riot and arson, SNCC is presently
under the titular leadership of William Edward Hunt,

Hunt also serves as head of the organization's Revolutionary
Political Council. \ :

Hunt, has successfully directed the opening of a
"coffeehouse"t known as the Third Eye Lounge in Augusta,
Georgia. This facility, in line with SNCC's historical
anti-Vietnam War posture, is to serve as a propaganda center
from which to foment anti-Vietnam War sentiments among black
military personnel at Fort Gordon, Georgia, as well as among
the black civilian population in that area, In addition,

Hunt has initiated publication and distribution of a .
revolutionary news organ known as “National SNCC." Aggressive
programs are underway to obtain new SNCC activists, and in an
effort to capture the support of black females, the organization
recently formed The Third World Women's Alliance under the
leadership of Fran Beal, a member of SNCC's Revolutionary
Political Council,

Strong evidence of progress in connection with the
organization's plans to initiate guerrilla warfare tactics
is given by development of recent information indicating Hunt
and other SNCC leaders are in the process of selecting a
number of candidates to receive such training in North Korea,
These individuals, on completion of training, will serve as
instructors in various parts of the country, thus providing
“SNCC with a well-trained, hard-core cadre of personnel capable
of initiating acts of terror against individuals and institu-
tions of Government in furtherance of their revolutionary
objectives,

Investigations of SNCC, its leaders, affiliates,
and their activities continue to receive close supervision,
Information of pertinence concerning the organization
continues to be disseminated to the Department and other
interested Government agencies and officials.

JUNTA OF MILITANT ORGANIZATIONS
BUFILE 157-9903 (ueseeeen 4-H

The Junta of Militant Organizations (JOMO) is a black
extremist organization with headquarters in St. Petersburg, Florida.
It is the leading organization for all black militant groups in
Florida. JOMO was founded in St. Petersburg during May, 1968, with
85 ghetto youths, who believed liberation of black people will not
come about through "normal channels." The organization has
affiliated groups in Louisville, Kentucky and Gainesville, Florida.
During December, 1970, leaders of JOMO decided to expand their
operation throughout the nation. Attempts are currently being

made to create chapters in Boston, Massachusetts and Miami, Florida.
Joseph Waller, Jr., the articulate founder of JOMO, and present
Chairman of the organization intends to have all black militant
groups in Florida designated as organization chapters.

The organization's voice and propaganda are carried
out through the publication "The Burning Spear."' This publication
has urged blacks to buy arms and to be prepared to fight white
America. In this connection, JOMO members have participated in
racial démonstrations, used fire bombs and have been involved in
attacks on police through use of violence. Members reportedly
blew up a radio station in Tampa, Florida, and recently participated
in a plot to break out two black political prisoners from a
Florida prison, Eight members of the organization were arrested
in 1970 for committing three murders and 15 armed robberies. One
of the murders was committed to obtain money to pay:a water bill
for JOMO headquarters. .

The organization is in the process of accumulating weapons
and making plans for members to be taught guerrilla warfare and
firearms training. In this connection leaders are interested in
establishing contact with revolutionary African groups. Waller
desires to create within the organization "Simba Warriors" who
would act whenever violence might be necessary in order to "bring
down the white man.'' During December, 1970, Waller reportedly
had in his possession two Thompson sub-machine guns.

NATION OF ISLAM
Bufile 25-330971

i

The Nation of Islam (NOI) is an all-Negro,
semireligious organization headed by Eli. LAMINA, es
self-proclaimed messenger of Allah, Under Muhammad's
Leadership, the NOL has grown up into a nationwide
organization with a well-disciplined and devoted member-

ship of almost 6,000 comprised of approximately 50
numbered mosques and approximately 50 unnumbered groups.

The NOI continues to teach antiwhite, anti-
United States philosophy of hate aimed at a complete
separation of the races, It opposes any form of
integration and at the same time has remained aloof from
other black extremist groups who favor violence. During
racial disturbances, NOI members are given instructions
to not get involved in the rioting. The NOI also opposes
the war in Vietnam as a war against other non-whites and
implies in its teachings that members should not serve
in the United States Armed Forces as they can only serve
one master, Elijah Muhammad, It also supports the Arabs
in their conflict with Israel in the Middle East. The NOI
also publishes a weekly newspaper known as "Muhammad Speaks," which|
contains vicious antiwnite propaganda. An average of 475,000
copies of this newspaper are distributed each week in the black
communities and ghetto areas throughout the United States.

We’ have conducted a continuous security and/or
‘vacial-type investigation of this organization since 1953
‘in accordance with directives of the Department. Each
active NOI group is reported on semiannually and the
‘functionaries and leaders of the organization are those
being investigated, The Department by letter dated 7/28/66
requested our investigation of this organization be continued.

Communist Influence of Racial Groups
100-442529

This intensification was initiated in August,
1964. The subject matter was previously reported in a
subsection of the Communist Party report, but the volume
and importance of this informationmade it necessary to
follow this communist influence in a separate investigation.
This investigation includes not only the influence of the
Communist Party but also that of the Trotskyite groups,
splinter groups and others including the New Left.

The overall objective in this and related
investigations is to protect the internal security of
the United States by submitting information relating to
possible Federal violations to the Attorney General for
prosecution. We also have the responsibility to develop
intelligence inform: and disseminate to interested
Government agencies. ere feasible, certain counter-
intelligence measures are employed to neutralize the
communist influence in the racial field.

Reports are submitted quarterly and the investi-
gation is evaluated upon receipt of each report. Pertinent
‘information is disseminated to the White House and the
‘Attorney General.

The year 1970 saw continued influence by
communists and other subversives in extremist groups.
In fact, the communist attempts to influence the black
extremist Black Panther Party were so insistent that the
Panthers have become wary of the motives of the Communist
Party. This has not diminished in any way the Communist
Party's efforts to influence and support the Black Panther
Party, the communist tactic being to Support the Panthers
whether they want it or not.

One illustration of the communist influence on
the violence-prone Black Panther Party is the situation in
which Huey Newton, Panther Supreme Commander, found himself

in connection with a film on Angela Davis, the communist and
black revolutionary being held in California on murder
charges. The Communist Party, USA, sponsored a motion
picture on Davis and invited Newton to film the introduction
to the film. -Newton conferred with Eldridge Cleaver, exiled
Information Minister of the Panthers, and told Cleaver he
positively would not film the introduction because it appeared
he would be required to follow the Commmist Party line and,
according to Newton, the Panthers did not follow anyone's
line. Despite Newton's seemingly hard stand on this, the
Communist Party found ways to make him relent, and three days
later he agreed to the communist request, muttering that he

‘ would be "ddmned if he did and damned if he didn't." As
violent as they are, the Panthers are no match for the
sophistication of the experienced communist intrigue.

The communist hoodwinking is not confined to the
Black Panther baneabiee The Communist Party's well-oiled
propaganda machine has started to artfully transform Angela
Davis, the accomplice in the brutal murder of a judge in
California, into a national monument and into a growing
source of funds. Not new at this sort of thing, the
communists, are well on their way to surpassing the monetary
returns they have received from other racial and ethnic
causes they have exploited, such as the Scottsboro boys,
-nine young blacks convicted twice in the 1930s in Alabama
for raping two white girls on a freight train.

The communist influence in the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC), the organization of the late
Martin Luther King, Jr., has continued since King's death.
Although Hunter Pitts O'Dell, a communist, amicably terminated
his position as aide to the Scie President in December, 1970,
his influence continues as does that of Stanley Levison and
Harry Wachtel who also have communist backgrounds. Levison
handles the SCLC fund-raising. In the past Levison and
“Wachtel, operated behind the scenes; t oday they are listed
in SCLC literature as directors of the SCLC. :

In the past year, as anticipated} there has been
a continued merging of racial activists and extremists with
pro-Chinese communist groups, Trotskyites, the Students for

Elbert Howard, a Black Panther Party functionary, stated that
the Black Panther Party is composed of Marxist-Leninist

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM - BLACK EXTREMISTS
Bufile 100-448006

Counterintelligence in the black extremist field is
a supplement to our investigative activities that cannot be
identified as a function of this Bureau because of its
clandestine nature, The goals of it are to prevent violence
and other illegal activities by black extremists and black
extremist organizations, to prevent the growth and/or unifica-
tion of bkck extremist groups, to prevent such groups from
gaining respectability and to preclude the rising of a leader
who might unify and electrify various extremist factions and
individuals,

To achieve these objectives, techniques are employed
to neutralize organizations and individuals involved in
extremist activities that are a threat to the internal security
of this-country. These techniques are aimed to embarrass,
expose or otherwise neutralize these organizations and individuais.

Counterintelligence action regarding black extremists
was initiated 8/25/67 and was last justified 5/14/70,

Counterintelligence operations are supervised on
individual case desks as a logical adjunct. of our investigative
activities, In addition, one supervisor is designated coordinator
to insuré that operdions initiated in different offices do not
conflict, A quarterly letter is submitted for each participating
division showing operations under consideration and results
gained, All communications authorizing the institution of any
counterintelligence operaions are routed through Assistant to
the Director William C, Sullivan; no operations are initiated
by the field without Bureau approval. ,

Counterintelligence operations and techniques were
thoroughly discussed with field representatives attending the
October 22 and 23, 1970, conference at the Bureau concerning
the Black Panther Party (BPP). The conference concluded
| * counterintelligence was an effective tool and there was a
definite need for counterintelligence operations to neutralize
black extremist activities.

The effect on black extremists of some authorized
counterintelligence operations are difficult to assess, but
a substantial number effected since last inspection have had
measurable consequences and some of these included the
following:

Four articles revealing extremist nature of BPP
based on information furnished a news media source in
Mississippi resuited in the closing of the Bry chapter in”
Cleveland, Mississippi. Agents of the Jackson Office were
commended by the Director for this operation,

Following the arrests of BPP leadership in New Haven
after torture-murder of BPP member in May, 1969, a Black
Panther from Boston was sent to New Haven to rebuild that
chapter. He proved to be an energetic organizer who built
a closely knit and highly disciplined organization that
effectively brought about mass demonstrations, attracted
additional membership and which posed a serious threat to
established Government. To neutralize this dynamic leader,
New Haven was authorized to forward an anonymous letter to
national BPP headquarters in California alleging he had
embezzled BPP funds, Since then, numerous reports have been
teceived indicating he had fallen into disfavor with BPP
leaders and his motives were suspect, This resulted in his
transfer to an insignificant BPP chapter in North Carolina. .

In Rochester, New York, an anonymous letter sent
to the Superintendent of Schools resulted in cancellation of
subscriptions to the obscene, hate-filled, extremist newspaper
-of the BPP by a high school. These newspapers had been used

HW 55151 DocIda:32989638 Page 505



in classrooms and costs of subscriptions had been charged
to the school system.

Philadelphia division was authorized to send a
letter to BPP national headquarters bearing an excellent
facsimile of signature of a former BPP officer in Philadelphia
who had been expelled a week previously due to problems with
BPP leadership in Philadelphia. The letter accused Philadelphia
BPP members of stealing clothing, food and drugs collected for
poor children. All of these accusations, incidentally, were
true. Since this letter was sent, Philadelphia BPP chapter has
experienced severe problems with BPP headquarters, has been
chastised repeatedly and prevented from participating in some
BPP activities. Several members were disciplined by transfers.
Subsequently, this situation was exploited by an authorized
mailing of an anonymous letter to Huey P, Newton, Supreme
Commander and co-founder of BF, which criticized the meetings tebl
under BPP auspices in Philadelphia September 5-7, 1970,
concerning the planning for BPP-sponsored Revolutionary People's
Constitutional Convention, These counterintelligence operations
were primarily responsible for expulsion of head of the Phila-
delphia BPP and many of his followers from BPP on 10/16/70,
These individuals have formed an independent local group in
Philadelphia which contends with BPP for local support in that
city. Thus, another result of this operation has been the
splintering of Philadelphia BPP chapter.

To exploit a split in BPP leadership in Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, Charlotte was authorized to prepare
and send a leaflet to residents in vincinity of BPP headquarters.’
The leaflet insinuated the head of one BPP faction had pocketed
, donations secured for BPP Breakfast for Children Program, The
‘leaflet caused consternation among BPP personnel and resulted in
“young Negro males poking fun at this BPP leader and accusing him
of being a parasite. A decrease in financial donations to BPP
followed the distribution of this leaflet.

: Los Angeles set up a television expose of BPP in
which George Putnam, newscaster KITV->Los Angeles, California,
noted that spread of Panther hoodlum-type revolutionary activity

| NW 55151 Docld:32989638 Page 506 lye



was a serious internal security threat, with law enforcement
as its immediate target. He utilized the Director's compre-
hensive testimony on the BPP before the House Sub-Committee
on Appropriations on 3/5/70 in bringing out the revolutionary
and terroristic threat presented by BPP and its leaders. He
concluded the program with the opinion that "we are subsidizing
our own destruction if we allow this to continue."

To drive a wedge between BPP and many of its
contributors, data concernng the anti-Zionist and anti-Semetic
nature of BPP was furnished a news media source. As a result
articles were published during June and July, 1970, in various
newspapers throughout U.S., including "Long Island Press,"
Long Island, New York;'"Daily News,'' Springfield, Massachusetts;
and "Mobile Register," Mobile, Alabama. These articles
discussed the close alliance developed between BPP and Al Fatah,
an Arab terrorist organization waging guerrilla warfare against
Israel. These articles emphasized that numerous pro-Arab and
anti-Israeli articles have been published in the BPP newspaper
and some of the latter articles called for the complete distruc-
tion of Israel.

The above articles as well as many other counterintelli-
gence operations authorized since last inspection have contributec
materially to drying up of contributions to BPP. Loss of revenue
is one of the BPP's greatest problems and perhaps the best
illustration is the drop in the size and circulation of the
BPP newspaper, the Party's primary propaganda device. This
paper has declined from 20 or more pages to 12 in its 1/2/71
issue and circulation at the end of the year was less than
100,000 after a high of 183,000 in October, 1970.

Counterintelligence action has also contributed or
led to disruptions, dissension and factionalism in the BPP, the
most important of the black extremist organizations. Sources
have reported internal strife has developed among top BPP
leaders and there is a growing distrust among them of one
another. For example, Albert Howard, national leader who has
-been supervising BPP activities on East Coast, and Robert Bay,

a BPP leader in New York, have been recalled to national BPP

headquarters in California, where they were disciplined and
severely criticized. In addition, SF_3421-R* on 12/26/70
reported a degree of dissension between Eldridge Cleaver,
~Minister_of Information who is fugitive from justice ‘and.
residing in Algeria, and Huey P, Newton, Informant learned
Cleaver was extremely upset because BPP headquarters and
particularly Newton are not keeping in touch with him and are
not keeping him advised of key developments. This matter is
being closely and aggressively followed for purpose of
additional exploitation of these circumstances under this
program,

Effective means of neutralizing black extremist
groups is by drying up their sources of funds. We authorized
the New York division to advise the Episcopal Church Center
by anonymous letters that a $67,000 requested grant from the
Episcopal Church Screening Board in New York, New York, ts
finance the Liberation School in Atlanta, Georgia, was in
fact intended for use of Student National Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) as the school was an operation of SNCC, a
black extremist organization,and SNCC in seeking the grant had
concealed its connection with the school. This operation
resulted in the Church placing such low priority on this
request that financial assistance for the school was precluded
and the Liberation School was so advised. Since SNCC is in
poor financial condition, this denial of funds was a blow to
its endeavors to revitalize itself. The Director noted
"excellent" on 9/3/70 memorandum which advised of this
successful counterintelligence operation,

A highly successful counterintelligence operation
, exposed to college administrators the unethical and deceptive
, use made of college funds by Hack Student Organization,
‘Kalamazoo College, Kalamazoo, Michigan, to purchase literature
concerning the creation of explosive devices and concerning
guerrilla warfare. As a result of this operation, college
confiscated such literature, admonished Black Student Organi-
zation leaders and tightened administrative procedures to
preclude similar misuse of its funds.

The Jackson Office was authorized to furnish data

concerning Republic of New Africa (RNA), a violence-prone
black extremist separatist organization, to a cooperative
newspaper source, resulting in the publication of an
excellent article exposing the violent nature of this
organization on the front page of the only state-wide
evening newspaper in Mississippi. This publicity on the
evening before the RNA regional conference was to begin,
jolted RNA leaders. In addition, Negro participants from
Jackson area were shocked to learn of the violent nature
of this group and withdrew their support. The scheduled
agenda was shelved and the conference was completely
disrupted, Agents of the Jackson Office and Domestic
Intelligence Division Supervisor were commended by the
Director for this operation.

THE KEY BLACK EXTREMIST PROGRAM

\

On December 23, 1970, the Key Black Extremist
Program was initiated, with the Director's approval, to
intensify our coverage of certain black extremists who are
extremely active and most vocal in their calls for terrorism
and violence. As the program started about 90 were included.
With Bureau approval others may be added by the field. This
program is to provide intensified coverage of the day-to-day
activities and future plans of these people and to assure
that all possible violations of law on their parts are
vigorously investigated when they are within our jurisdiction
and are referred promptly to the appropriate agency when they
are not.

An investigative summary report on all these
people is due by February 15, 1971. Thereafter an investi-
gative report is to be submitted every 90 days.

BLACK STUDENT GROUPS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

On October 29, 1970, the Executive Conference
approved a program to conduct discreet preliminary inquiries,
limited to established sources, on Black Student Unions and
similar groups, their leaders, and key activists to determine
if the activities of these groups and individuals warrant
further active investigation. On November 4, 1970,
instructions were sent to the field to implement this
program. The number of campuses involved is about 500,
representing approximately 750 black student groups. The
officers will represent about 2,500 cases and the key
activists another 250. The potential for new cases in this
program will approximate 3,500 casés. This program includes
junior colleges and two-year colleges as well as four-year
colleges.

RACIAL INFORMANTS

The prime purpose of development and utilization
of racial informants and sources is to provide intelligence
and evidentiary information concerning black and white racial
extremist organizations and individuals, These sources are
also called upon to furnish information concerning the general
racial situation in all parts of the country.

Supervision of racial informants at Seat of
-Government includes review and approval of new informants and
confidential sources, review of progress of informant every
\ six months, review of payments being made to informants,

7 analysis of informant coverage in each field office, analysis

of nationwide informant overage of an organization, coordination
of informant coverage of specific functions such as the national
convention of the Black Panther Party (BPP) and supervision

of syecial projects such as development of top echelon BPP
informant, using informant to develop information concerning

a black extremist underground escape route and coordinating
utilization of informants abroad with other agencies, AI1
procedures are constantly evaluated in an effort to increase

the efficiency of our operation and to provide the field with
the necessary supervision and assistance with a minimum of

paper work,

As of 1/12/71 we are operating a total of 8:
racial informants, compared with a total of 5,485 at time of
last inspection, This is an increase of 1,595. Snformants.
-584 informants report on black extremist organizations. _376
informants report on white extremist organizations such as
the Klan, (in line with recent reorganization of Domestic
Intelligence Division supervision of racial informants
furnishing information on white extremists will shortly be
transferred to the Internal Security Section.) We are
operating 6,224 ghetto informants who provide general
information within the black ghetto areas of our cities.

Informant coverage of black extremist groups has
been increased since the last inspection with a significant
increase being noted in our coverage of the BPP. At the time
of the last inspection we operated 119, informants reporting
on BPP as compared with 173. as of 1/12/71, which represents
an increase of 54 informants.

Our ghetto informants have materially increased
from 4,605,at the time of the last inspection to_6,224
as of 1/12/71, which represents an increase of 1,619.

At the time of the last inspection we were
operating 438 informants furnishing information concerning
white extremist organizations and as of 1/12/71 we are
operating 376 such informants, which represents a decrease
of 62.. This is to be expected as a result of the continuing
decline of Klan and other white extremist activities,

By memorandum dated 5/5/70 from G. C. Moore to
Mr, W. C, Sullivan, captioned "Racial Informant Development,
Black Panther Party (BPP), Racial Matters," it was recommended
and approved that two Special Agents of the San Francisco
Division be assigned to work exclusively on developing a
top-level informant in the BPP, It was also approved that
ie O00 could be expended for the purpose of developing a

GHETTO INFORMANTS

Ghetto informant program was instituted 10/11/67
to fulfill an urgent need to develop a network of "listening
posts" in the ghetto areas of our cities. Ghetto informants
were those persons living or working in the ghetto areas who
furnished information concerning general racial conditions in
their areas. ‘As the field has gained experience in the
handling of ghetto informants their value has steadily increased.
Ghetto informants today are being utilized by field offices to
attend public meetings held by extremists, to survey extremist

c

bookstores, to verify residences and employments of Agitator
and Security Index subjects living or working in ghetto areas
and to identify individuals responsible for extremist
activities tending to increase raciai tensions in the ghetto
areas, We are also noting numerous instances wherein ghetto
informants are being converted by the field to regular racial
informants furnishing information on black extremist
organizations and individuals, As a valuable by-product

we are also picking up criminal statistics through our contacts
with ghetto informants, The ghetto informant program was last
justified by memorandum G, C, Moore to Mr, W,. C, Sullivan
dated 7/17/70, captioned "Ghetto Informant Program, Racial
Matters," and is scheduled to be rejustified in July, 1971,

_ TRAINING

A two-day conference of field supervisors handling
racial matters investigations was held at Seat of Government
9/17-18/70, Representatives from 39 offices and two Legal
Attaches attended. The conference dealt specifically with
investigation of the BPP and informant development therein,
A number of recommendations and suggestions resulted from
this conference and were implemented, Suggestions approved
as results of the conference aré the subject of a separate
write-up, Those in attendance were in agreement that the
conference had been most beneficial to both field and Seat
of Government personnel participating.

a list of 298 active poieniiai duabie agents. A review of 237 files (80%) indicated
the following:

a. These files deal primarily with PSIs and some Sis who have limited
Social, situational and business contacts with Soviet and Satellite nationals.
Most of these nationals are allegedly intelligence agents, suspected intelligence
agents or persons who are contacts of these nationals.

b. Generally the people selected for development as potential double agents

_are correspondents and journalists who come in contact with Tass news agency

officials and employees; American businessmen who purchase Russian products
or sell American products through Amtorg or other Russian companies operating
in the United States; neighbors and building managers where nationals reside;
naturalized American citizens of Slavic derivation who are contacted by suspected
intelligence agents; naturalized American citizens who travel to Russia and
satellite countries; leaders. of Slavic -American societies, organizations and

" publications; American citizens taking educational and business tours in Russia
_ and other Iron Curtain countries; and prominent members of technical and

scientific societies who have an interest in similar scientific work and publications
by Russian and satellite country professionals,

c. Generally a thorough background investigation is completed on each
individual selected to be a potential double agent before the Bureau authorizes
him to be interviewed to determine if he is receptive and willing to assist
and cooperate with the Bureau, These investigations are not completed within a
Specified period. Several instances were noted wherein the national returned
to his native country before the informant could develop suitable rapport. Review
indicated several of these cases remain active although the national returned to
his native country.

d. After the Bureau has authorized the field office to develop the potential
double agent, the field office sends in progress reports each 6 months (FD-40l).
In most instances only a slight social acquaintanceship is established over an
extensive period. Field and SOG supervision of these cases appears to be
mechanical and perfunctory and lacksimaginative, aggressive and timely
direction.

e. During the year 1970 there was an average of three communications
per file received from the field. Most of these were semiannual reports.
Communications from SOG io the field averaged less than one letter per
file and in almost all instances this was a very short letter authorizing in-
vestigation and development of potential double agent. There were less than 10
cases noted where specific instructions, directions or other guidance was
furnished to the field in developing these potential double agents.

f, 10 of the cases were reviewed at random for the specific purpose of
: determining generally how long they had been pending, Ae cases had been pending
prior to 1960; 3 were open in 1961;,6,in 1962; 7_in 1963; 6 ih 1964; 5 in 1965; 10,
in 1966; 12 in ‘Wer: 10 in 1968; 22 in in 1969; and (25 in 1970. The average case has
been opened 3 1/2 yea years and there has been an & average of one piece of outgoing
correspondence from the Bureau in each file.

Very little outgoing correspondence concerning instructions or directions
were noted in thesé JJ0 files. For example, _5 of the files reviewed had no out-
going correspondence in them since 1967. One file was reviewed in which the
last outgoing correspondence was. in 1962. 65. of these 110 files did not have any
outgoing correspondence in the last 12-month th period (1970).

Review of this program as indicated by the above observations, reveals
that virtually no direction is given the program. Separate write-ups have
been prepared on two individual cases where supervision has been most inadequate.

INSPECTOR DONALD E. MOOR: The comments and observations
(1-24-71 # S:EWL:DEM/djw:ekn) of the Inspector dealing with
t Be) aeauena a "POTENTIAL DOUBLE AGENT

PROGRAM" have been carefully reviewed and the following comments |
are responsive to the questions raised:

For purposes of clarification it is important that
the terminology and designations used be defined. The
designation "Potential Double Agent" (PDA) is a descriptive
term denoting an individual usually already approved by the
Bureau as a Potential Security Informant (PSI) or as a Security
Informant (SI). The approval of a PSI or SI is based on his
current or potential capabilities to furnish information of
intelligence or security interest. If individuals in either
of these categories have an association with a Soviet-bloc official,
for statistical purposes they are considered as PDA's, This
labeling is in¢idental to their primary designation as a Bureau-
approved PSI or SI, and their administrative handling at the Bureau
conforms with overall Bureau policy and instructions relating
to all Bureau approved sources, whether or not they are
considered to be PDA's, and this designation does not alter
the administrative handling of these cases.

dJustifications for Bureau~approved PSI's and SI's
are required on a six-month basis following definitely
estdlished form. The primary purpose of this justification
is administrative in nature to insure the individual
involved continues to meet Bureau standards, Substantive
information which may have been furnished is reported in
detail in the 134 file maimtained by the Office of Origin
as required by Bureau regulations. This information is
then reported to the Bureau under appropriate substantive
captions. Normally the only occasion when substantive
data received from a source appears in the informant case
file is in the semi-annual justification letter in extremely
abbreviated form. See Section 107K, paragraph 7, page 13,
Manual of Instructions which states,

"Correspondence in security informant and
potential security informant matters should

be strictly limited to administrative handling
of informant and should not contain information
more properly furnished under substantive case
caption,"

Regarding specific comments in paragraph c.,

as pointed out, the primary designation of| an individual
as a PSI or SI is his ability to furnish information of
intelligence interest, which may or may not depend upon
his association with one Soviet-bloc national. This
association almost without exception becomes productive
only when the Soviet~bloc official initiates action to
exploit this relationship. The fact that the Soviet-bloc
national departs this-country, first, does not end their
relationship, and secondly, does not end the potential
that exists in the relationship. Very often there is a
follow-up contact by another Communist-bloc official based
on the apparently disrupted initial relationship,
Characteristic of the patient, long-range planning and
execution of Soviet-bloc intelligence, this reactivation
may occur at some indeterminate future date. We must be
alert to this concrete possibility in order to fully exploit
the potential that exists in such cases. Therefore,
contacts with the source, in cases of this type, must
continue for a reasonable period.

Concerning paragraph d., in cases where the
potential for development of an individual as a double
agent is based exclusively on a social acquaintanceship
with a specific Soviet-bloc official, the initiative for
this development rests almost entirely with. that Soviet-
bloc official, Experience has taught us that attempts
on our part to maniuplate our sources to hasten his
development are most often recognized by the hostile

“ intelligence officer as a provocation. When direction

is necessary and practical, it must be developed in the
overall context of the Soviet-bloc official's investigation,
and such direction is apparent in the substantive case
files. These factors will account for what appears to

be “mechanical and perfunctory" supervision which "lacks
imaginative, aggressive and timely direction," in the
informant case file.

Paragraph e. refers to the lack of communications
in the informant files reviewed. The nature and purpose
of the informant file has been previously explained, and
in this context it can be understood that operational
instructions usually appear in the substantive files and
not in the administrative file of the informant,

SB



-6~

Paragraph f notes many instances of cases
concerning "PDA's" have been opened for varying periods
of time, and, again, the lack of extensive outgoing
communications noted. It is again stressed that the
designation of “PDA' is an arbitrary one, these files are
evaluated and administered on an individual basis in
accordance with Bureau requirements related to PSI's and
SI's, and not solely on their double-agent potential.
These requirements are met in these cases,

: The Inspector has commented in his Survey that
"virtually no direction is given the program." The
foregoing comments have established 1.) the designation
of PDA to a SI or PSI does not require administrative
supervision or handling by SOG over and above that required
for any SI or PSI, 2.) if direction and instruction is
necessary and practical in a particular case, such is
given in the overall supervision and handling of the
substantive case file of the Soviet-bloc national involved,
8.) in accordance with current Bureau policy and instructions
relating to the handling of these files, they coutaiii a
Minimal amount of information relating to the productivity
of the source, and 4.) the labeling and designation of a
SI and PSI as a PDA is an administrative device adopted
for the purpose of emphasizing the need for Double-Agents.
There is no program as such, for the handling of these
cases. :

To the general consideration expressed that the
298 cases are mere numbers from a supervisory standpoint,
the above comments clearly indicate such is not the case,
These cases are not opened and maintained as a program,
They are opened on individual merit and maintained in
accordance with Bureau standards under the same requirements
as all other PSI and SI cases at the SOG.

: In summary, it appears that the criticisms leveled

in this particular-Survey are due to a misconception involving
terminology. "PDA" is a label. It carries no requirement

for administrative handling over and above supervision afforded
the case as a PSI or SI. These cases are basic and vital
investigative tools, Administration of such cases are

guided by rigid Bureau standards; the comments made by
Inspector do not indicate these standards have been breached.
Thus, no corrective action is considered necessary and none is
recommended. This does not mean that I will not continuo to
exert every effort to see that qualified informants will
continue to be developed and that carefully considered and

logical means will be employed to have these informants

i

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D. BRENNAN I have carefully noted
(DEM: ekn 1-24-71) the comments of the

Inspector and also those
of Mr. Moore, I certainly am aware that Double-Agents active
against Soviet-bloc officials are a vital part of our
counterespionage work, I share the views expressed by
Mr. Moore and assure the inspector I will closely follow
the development of informants in this field and see that
proper guidance is given the field to increase the number
of active Double-Agents.

Soviet espionage is one of the greatest challenges we
have in the Bureau today and during this inspection our review
of your program was made with this attitude, I have reviewed
with great interest the accomplishments and progress which you
have made; however, there were certain aspects of your operation

. Which have caused concern. Specifically, your handling of
"Potential Double Agents" does not nearly result from a review
standpoint with the feeling that this phase of work is compatible
with the challenges presented. Elsewhere in this inspection we

“have discussed development of Double Agents in place as being

highly desirable goals in our work, yet, we have lac! success,
in this as evidenced by an extended "dry" period of almost nine

I feel that perhaps foreign intelligence may not be that
good and that by improving ourselves we may be able to accomplish
our goals, In the above write-up it was my feeling that your
Potential Double Agent program needs considerable attention from

a critical self-analysis standpoint for the purpose of strengthening
it consistent with its potential for providing valuable assistance
both here and in the field.

The comments of the Inspector are noted,

I most certainly share the Inspector's view that
Soviet espionage is one of the greatest challenges we have
in the Bureau today. I have and am continually stressing the
development of good double agents, The Inspector referred to
"Double Agents-ineplace," and in view of the context of his
remarks, I concluded he is referring to "Defectors-in-place,"
and I know of no higher goal in our work than developing then,

It appears. that the successes of the recent and
current New. York, efforts in these matters still have not been
brought to the attention of the Washington Field Office, in
the form of instructions or directions to analyze their
situation for possible implementation of the program (if not
already being dane) in the Was. ngton ares...

For this. reason, you are being requested to advise
of supervisory procedures you have to insure the dissemination
of new techniques and the "cross-fertilization" of ideas to
appropriate offices.

It is realized that New York furnishes copies of
communications to Washington Field ‘bftice.. What provisions
do you have at the Seat of Government to insure adequate,
aggressive attention and supervision is provided to the field
in matters such as this?

I have carefully noted the inspector's comments
and also the comments of Mr. Branigan and Mr. Moore. I
am most alert to the development of new ideas and the need
for "cross-fertilization" of ideas and stress this in my
conferences with all Section Chiefs at the Division. I
not only seek ideas about the operations of a Section Chief
within the Section, but for ideas of operations anywhere
within the Division and throughout the Bureau. I am
constantly alert in my many contacts with representatives
of other Government agencies, foreign liaison contacts
and representatives of business for ideas which can be
successfully utilized in our work and will continue this.
In discussions with SACs, I constantly stress the challenging
conditions the Bureau faces and the need for new ideas and
new applications, I most certainly will continue to stress
this.

ADDENDUM INSPECTOR E, S, MILLER
(ESM:sjr ~- 1/25/71)

It is my understanding that the COKMA concept is
not "new" in the NewYork, Office but, as indicated has had

recent successes. It is realized COKMA deals with subway

O11 ects;. however, the concept was that to
which I allud the above write-up. It was my feeling
perhaps due to internal conditions in the Soviet Union and
the Polish situation etc., that Soviet Intelligence may now
be more active and consequently “pressing" for some reason
thus making it possible for us to have significant success

in New York in a relatively short period of time.

For this reason, it was my feeling that the matter
should have been highlighted by SOG which has the responsibility
for coordination and direction of field activities,

: I do not agree with the concept that one field

‘ division is different from another when we are dealing with

as important a topic as Soviet espionage.

; ‘ I certainly agree with the Inspector that one
field division is no different than another in connection
with the topic as important as Soviet Espionage. The
point that Mr. Branigan and I were attempting to make is
that we have to recognize the difference in methods of
operation in Soviet intelligence officers jn New York.
and WFO. The Inspector may be assured that I will

i follow the operations of Soviet~bloc intelligence officers

| in New York, WFO and also in San Francisco in view of the

establishment of a consulate there. I will continue to be
most alert to any successful procedures utilized in one
office that may be productive in another and will certainly
see that the procedures are applied where feasible.

ADEQUACY OF PERSONNEL ole
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D, BRENNAN: Attached find the Section
ABK:jgr 1/15/71 A write-ups concerning each
on category of information
requested by the Inspector relative to adequacy of personnel.
These comments are current as of 1/8/71:

The personnel assigned to the Division Front Office
consists of one Assistant Director, two Inspectors, two
Special Agent Supervisors, five stenographic employees and
19 clerical employees, This complement includes the personnel
directly assigned to the Front Office, those in the Division
teletype room, Mail Room and messenger service, the Security .
Patrol Force in addition to five Agents. I have not as yet
requested a replacement for a GS-4 clerical position in the
Front Office, which was created with the resignation of
James A.Pettingill on 12/24/70. I am attempting to absorb
the work of this position with the present personnel comple-
ment in the Front Office. This is on a trial basis and if it
isn't satisfactory, I will recommend 4 veplacement.

The overall authorized personnel complement of the

Division at the beginning of the inspection was 116 Special

Agents and 190 clerks compared to an authorized compiement

of 126 Agents and 186 clerks at the time of the last

inspection. We now have assigned to the Division 116 Agents

and 188 clerks. The clerical vacancies being the aforementioned
- GS-4 position in the Front Office and a vacancy in the Mail

Room, which was created when a clerical position in the

Internal Security Section was filled.

At the present time we have outstanding requests
for two Agents to replace Special Agents George M._ Quinn :
and C, Edwin Enright, who are under transfer to the Inspection
Division. —"We"aTSo"Have requests for two GS-2 Mail Clerks
for the Division Mail Room to replace the clerk who was trans-~
ferred to the Internal Security Section and the second to replace
the GS-3 clerk who will be reassigned or rotated when the
replacement is made available to the Division. The Racial
Intelligence Section has submitted a request for an additional
clerk for the Black Nationalist - South and Racial Informant
Unit. In addition, this Section is now making a request for two
additional Agent Supervisors because of the heavy increase in the
case load in the black extremist field. (Justification in
Section write-up attached).

i,
The request for a clerk by the Internal Security Section for
a newly approved clerical position mentioned in its write-up
has been filled. The Espionage Section may find it necessary
to request an additional clerk to handle extra duties assigned
to a clerk who is already heavily assigned, if the present
system (now on a trial basis) proves unworkable. The New Left
Section may find it necessary to request an additional Agent
and clerk if the present trend of heavy increase in case
load continues. We are watching this closely. As you will
note in the write-up by the Nationalities Intelligence Section
we are making a request for two additional Agent Supervisors
at this time. This is necessary due to the recent increase
in foreign legats from 11 to 17, increasing our legat personnel
from 60 to 88,

‘To recapitulate, our requests for additional personnel
are: 2

Front office Two GS-2 clerks
Racial inieliigence — “One GS-4 clerk

One Agent Supervisor
to replace Supervisor

Enright.
Two additional Agent
Supervisors.
. Espionage Section One Agent Supervisor
to replace Agent Quinn.
Nationalities Intelligence Two additional Agent
Section Supervisors,

: I firmly believe that our limited requests for
additional personnel at this time are fully justified. As you
will note in the attached write~ups, we are not asking for
additional personnel until, after on a trial .basis, we have
found it absolutely necessary and fully justified. The increase
of terroristic tactics by the Weatherman faction of the
Students for a Democratic Society and militant organizations
such as the Black Panther Party and the Jewish Defense League
has made it absolutely imperative that intensive investigation
be conducted to identify, locate all members of these militant
organizations and secure evidence for prosecution, if we are
to meet our grave responsibilities in the extremely vital field
of internal security. This has increased the work load of the
Racial Intelligence Section, the New Left Section, and the
Nationalities Intelligence Section. Because of this increase

in work and my interest in conserving manpower.wherever possible,
we recently reorganized the Division in order to make the most
efficient use of our manpower. I conscientiously believe I

have now trimmed my manpower to the bone. Under my direction,
Branch and Section Chiefs continually evaluate personnel
adequacy in order to assure we get the job done with a

maximum amount of efficiency with the minimum amount of
personnel. I conscientiously believe I have done this and I
will continue to pursue this policy,

SPECIFIC COMMENTS

1. In Protest and Trotskyist Groups Unit, one
Special Agent Supervisor (McGuire) and one clerk (Hanning)
temporarily assigned New Left Section. Supervisor in Charge
of same Unit (Griffith) also spending majority of his time
in New Left Section assisting on special. An additional
Supervisor from International New Left Unit (Benedict) and
one clerk from Klan and White Hate Groups Unit (Déan) are
also working majority of their time on New Left Section
special. :

2. No pending transfers or resignations.
“> . 3. See number 1 above.

4. We have requested one additional clerical employee
for the Communist Party, USA, Unit (request not yet filled)
because of substantial need due to increase in Unit case load
from 572 to 1076 as a result of reorganization. We are currently
assessing need for another clerical employee in Klan and White
Hate Groups Unit to handle large v me of mail involved in
supervision of several hundred Klan and White Hate group informants.

5. Considering that Internal Security Section, as it
is now constituted, was established December 16, 1970, approxi-
mately three weeks ago, no meaningful comments regarding manpower
Savings as related to this Section can be made. We are carrying
‘a substantial case load, with increases in several areas. For
example, the case load of the Communist Party, USA, Unit as a
result of the reorganization increased from 572 to 1076 with no
increase in personnel. Additionally, two Supervisors assigned to
this Section (Griffith and McGuire) are on temporary loan to the
New Left Section along with a clerical employee (Hanning).
Additionally, a third Supervisor (Benedict) and a second clerical
employee (Dean) are spending the majority of their working time
on assignment to New Left Section special. For all practical
purposes, the work of three Supervisors and two clerical employees
is being absorbed on a daily basis within the present personnel
complement which, of course, is a tangible manpower savings. In
all Units we are constantly involved in attempting to eliminate
or curtail the volume of paperwork being handled, reducing
/programs and projects to-bare essentials and wherever possible,
keeping the case load volume at a manageable figure.

Another example of manpower conservation exists in
the Subversive Individuals - Basic Revolutionary Groups Unit

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION INSPECTION
1/13/71
DEXC:bew

| NW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 541



which handles approximately 1,400 pending cases and is

| responsible for over 7,000 subjects on the Bureau's Special
j Indices. A moratorium on routine communist investigations

i in effect at the time of the last inspection, which curtailed
the work of this Unit, has been removed and the case load
increases daily. The removal of the moratorium warranted
the expansion of this Unit from a two to three-man Unit at
the time of reorganization but for all practical purposes,
the Unit has functioned as a two-man Unit with the third
man (Schwartz) on loan for the majority of the period to the
Research Section for a special project.

6. When Special Agent supervisory personnel
currently assigned, temporarily on loan to other Sections,
are returned, we will have adequate personnel to handie
existing case load.

7. %In evaluating adequacy of both Special Agent
and clerical personnel the following criteria were used:

case load

Mail count

name checks

complexity of cases and supervision involved
deadline matters

special assignments
- experienced supervisors

Administrative duties assigned Supervisors in
Charge (reviewing mail, conferring with employees, organizing
Unit) limit to some extent the volume of case assignments
handled.

3. Special Investigations - West Unit has one Agent and one
clerk on loan from the Internal Security Section.

4. Activities by New Left terrorists during the past year
has been marked by an increase in acts of violence and
conspiracies toward violence. The Weatherman group and
other such groups have made it imperative that we institute
continuing intensive investigations. By approved airtel to
SAC, Albany, and all offices dated 11/4/70, the field was
instructed to initiate investigation of all members of the
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and members of

_ procommunist militant New Left type campus organizations

AW 55151

which follow SDS advocacy of violence and revolution. It
is estimated that this will involve some 6,500 new investi-
gations. If this trend continues, it will be necessary to
obtain an additional clerk in the future; however, we are
not requesting any additional clerical personnel at this
time.

5. At the time of the Last inspection, this Section had

22 Agents and 27 clerical employees authorized of which

22 Agents and 25 clerical employees were assigned. As a
result of the. realignment of the Divisionin December, 1970,
this Section currently has 22 Agents and 23 clerical employees
authorized.

6. As noted in number 4 above, the increase in terroristic
activities by New Left militants has increased the burden

of this Section. . On the basis of the above, if this trend
continues, it appears that it will be necessary to obtain one
additional Agent in the future.

7. Personnel adequacy in the New Left. Section is constantly
evaluated on the basis of the productivity of each unit,
requests received from the Department and other agencies

and the overall objectives of the Section. The delinquent
work in each unit is closely followed and in special situations
where an excessive amount of work is assigned to one unit
supervisory personnel from other units are utilized.

5. Since last inspection we have reduced one Agent from the
complement of the Racial Reporting Unit as a result of various streamlining
measures adopted relative to reporting requirements. This streamlining
involved the elimination of a substantial number of letterhead memoranda and
airtels previously required from each field office with regard to racial .
conditions and the elimination of daily cover memorandum to our outgoing
racial teletype to the White House,

6. The authorized Agent complement for Section is considered
adequate but not excessive at this time.

7. Criteria used in assessing personnel adequacy in this Section
includes a number of diverse factors. Case load figures are not applicable
to work of this Section nor are there any other simple, quantitative measure-
ments of Section's work. Work of this Section involves primarily research
and evaluation and the preparation of a variety of documents aimed at providing
intelligence to the White House, the Attorney General, other interested
agencies and Bureau officials. This Section seeks to. summarize into
comprehensive and meaningful "package" form information relating to current
topics of intelligence interest and concern. The finished product is
provided not only to other intelligence agencies and policy-making officials
of the Government but, where appropriate, to our field offices for their
information and guidance. The type of documents prepared varies from

. daily teletype summaries regarding racial disturbances and student agitation,

to detailed monographs containing in-depth research into various facets of
our work.

During the past year there has been a continuing demand for
various intelligence summaries and this Section has been faced with a
number of expedite projects on behalf of Bureau officials, including the
Director, the White House, the Vice President's Office, and the Attorney
General. Basis for this heavy work load has primarily been interest and
concern in the explosive issues concerning racial and student disorders.
The great majority of our projects have revolved around the preparation
of material either for internal FBI use or for outside dissemim tion with
respect to these issues, i

_Barbara, Ann Holland and Keith R, White submitted resignations
“Close of business “January ry 8; ~ L971. Replacements were received
as enumerated in item one above,

(3) As of January 8, 1971, there was a shortage of
two GS-4 Clerk in the Officials Unit - Washington, but this
Was remedied on January 11, when replacements were received
as indicated in item one above. A replacement has been requested
for Special Agent George M, Quinn in the Officials Unit - New York,
but none has been “designated at this time. There is no overage
of authorized personnel in the Espionage Section,

(4) Clerical personnel is considered adequate at the
present time. With the reorganization of thé Division, and
combining Soviet and Soviet~bloc investigations in the Espionage
Section, an extremely heavy burden has been placed on the clerical
personnel handling the assignment cafds for the Sectiou (ihere are
now 5,046 cases). This situation is being watched and it may be
that it is unworkable to place the responsibility for maintaining
the assignment cards in a GS-4 employee who is already heavily
assigned. If this proves to be a fact, a recommendation will be
ttade to add a Clerk at a GS-3 level who would exclusively handle
the assignment cards.

(5) Following the 1970 inspection, personnel handling
Soviet investigations was reduced by two Special Agents, GS-14,
Following the inspection, personnel handling Soviet=bioc
investigations were reduced by one Special Agent, GS-14, and
one Clerk, GS-4. At the time of the reorganization of the-
Division in December, 1970, personnel handling Soviet-bloc
investigations were reduced by four Special Agents (one GS-15;
three GS-14) and five clerical personnel (one GS-5 and four GS-4).

(6) Special Agent personnél is considered adequate.

N (7) Criteria utilized in determining the adequacy of
personnel includes the volume of cases supervised, the complexity
of the cases, and the importance of the investigations.

In the Officials Unit, both Washington and New York,
we handle the greatest volume of complex investigations since

these cases include the bulk of our double agent operations,
As of December 1, 1970, there were 74 active double agents in the
Soviet field. This is the largest number of double agents we
have ever achieved. At the time of the last inspection as of
April 1, 1970, there were 67 active double agents, The current
number of 74 is compared most favorably with the number of actual
double agents three years ago (12/1/67), wren there were AY active
double agents. At that time there were 18 case Agents handling
Soviet matters, At the time of the last imspection, there were
16 case Agents in the Soviet field, and the current load is being
carried by less than 14 case Agents. Threm of the 14 are assigned
part time to the handling of Soviet-bloc matters,

With the reorganization of the Division in December, 1970,
the volume and work load for the Supervisezs in the Espionage
Section were materially increased, Four Agent Supervisors who
ware formerly assigned to the Sino-Satellite Section were
transferred to the Espionage Section and Ekrought with them in
excess of 2,000 cases, The only possible way that this volume
could be handied was by redistributing the work within the
Coordination Unit and the Special Cases Unit. The volume of
investigations in these Units is extremely heavy considering the
nuinber of special projects and special opssations which are
normally assigned in the Units,

In the Satellite Unit handling Pslish, Romanian,
Czechoslovakian, and Yugoslav investigative matters, we currently
have 1,293 active cases divided among four Special Agents.

In our Soviet-bloc counterintelligence work, we were as of
December 1, 1970, operating 64 active double agents. This should
be compared with the figure at the time of our last inspection,
April 1, 1970, when there were 61 active double agents,

nationalist movement (Bureau file 157-8415), This was accom-
plished July 6, 1970. 2) On November 3, 1970, the Agitator
Index was revised to delete those who were also included on
the Security Index, 3) On November 5, 1970, existing
instructions were modified concerning recordings of black

551



and New Left public appearances to allow the SAC to
i authorize use of concealed recording devices by a
Special Agent or a proven source in covering public
appearances by black and New Left extremists except
such appearances at educational institutions, Pre-
viously, prior Bureau approval was necessary.

In addition, we continue to utilize our
teletype dissemination facilities to the maximum
extent possible,

6) The Special Agent complement of 21 is
the same as at the time of the last Inspection.

; The Division was reorganized December 17,

1570, om the basis of approximate caselcad per Supervisor
of 279, This figure was based on the October 1, 1970,
easeload figures. Since that time there has been a

heavy increase in the caseload in the black extremist
field where at present the average caseload as of
Jamary 1, 1971, stood at 349 per Supervisor. At the

_ time of the last Inspection, the caseload of the Section
stood at 5,946 including Klan and white hate-type cases,
Under the reorganization this Section lost the Klan and
white hate cases and as of January 1, 1971, the caseload
encompassing black extremist individuals and organizations
including racial informants in these organizations stood
at 6,642, anincrease of 696 cases since the date of the
last Inspection,

There is-a dire need for additional Special Agent
supervisory personnel to handle our heavy responsibilities
in the black extremist field, if we are to afford these cases
the attention that they deserve. Based upon the Division
reorganization figures, an additional four Supervisors would

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 552



a,

be required; however, we have tightened our belt and
taken streamlining measures wherever possible and are
requesting only two Special Agent Supervisors at the
present time. We will attempt to accomplish our
objectives with two additional Supervisors,

There are several factors that would indicate
our work in the black extremist field will continue to
‘increase, The increasing militancy of black extremists
on college campuses caused us to require the field (by
airtel 11/4/70) to open cases on all black student groups
on college campuses as well as cases on the leaders
thereof, There are numerous such groups throughout the
United States, The Black Panther Party is growing and in
September, 1970, opened up an ‘international seciion in
Algiers, In addition a grand jury is sitting in California
with witnesses being heard in efforts to develop a prosecutive
theory against the Black Panther Party, The work in connection
therewith and other aspects of the Black Panther Party invest-
igation consumes almost the full time of one Supervisor,

Black extremist activity in this country is
rapidly developing more and more in international aspects,
Residents of other countries, including United States
citizens and non-citizens, are involved in clandestine and
overt operational and propaganda activity among racial
extremists, We have targeted CIA as well as our Legal
Attaches abroad for the development of data regarding
foreign influences in the black extremist movement. The
National Security Agency has vast capabilities in developing

' the type of. information needed and we have alerted that
Agency to our basic needs and have made arrangements for
future assistance,

: A prime factor in the rapid increase in our
caseload has been our technical coverage of the Black
Panther Party, At the time of the last Inspection we
had six such technical surveillances in operation, We.
presently have 12,installed, one awaiting installation,

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 553



and one awaiting approval. This special coverage provides
on a daily basis a wealth of intelligence information and

is most productive source for the opening of numerous new
cases in the black extremist field, With the added coverage
we can expect a continuing increase in the caseload.

In view of the above factors, there exists a dire
need for two additional Special Agent Supervisors at this
time.

7) In evaluating personnel adequacy, we take
into consideration not only the caseload which is compiled
on a monthly basis but also results of periodic mail counts
taken on a qiarterly basis, Many of oer cases on key figures
in the black extremist movement such a David Hilliard,

Huey P. Newton, Elbert, Howard, Le, Roi jones., yetlLdnidee Cleaver ,
Emory, Douglas, and others require a considerable amount of
supervisory attention,

As previously noted, the Department is attempting
to develop a prosecutive theory against the Black Panther
Party and as a result it has been necessary to assign one
Supervisor almost exclusively to handle investigation of
this organization, The investigations of other organizations
require a great deal of supervisory attention and direction,
Analyses of current developments in the racial field, spacial
requests from other Government agencies, preparation of
special studies, and initiation of special projects all
require the expenditure of considerable supervisory time
and are taken into consideration in evaluating the adequacy

atchex)

(8) There was no shortage or overage of authorized personnel
as of close of business 1/8/71.

(4) Authorized clerical personnel complement is considered
adequate but not excessive.

(5) As result of last inspection authorized Agent complement was
reduced from 17 to 15. This manpower savings was effected by discontinuing
two programs and streamlining a third one. Supporting memoranda in this
regard have been submitted as attachments to yellow write-up 5~A-4on
Section and Unit Analysis dated 1/12/71. :

Memorandum io All Bureau Officials and Supervisors 70-13 dated
7/29/70 noted that the Liaison Section of Domestic Intelligence Division was
being abolished effective immediately. This resulted in a cut-back of one
Section Chief plus eight supervisory Special Agents who were engaged in
domestic liaison fwictions, Calls from other U. S. agencies formerly handled
by these nine men are now handled by Agent personnel throughout the Bureau
who are principally concerned with the subject matter of the call. By far,
the majority of such calls are handled by Agent personnel presently assigned
to Nationalities Intelligence Section. In addition, representatives of other
agencies who were contacted in their offices prior to discontinuance of
Liaison Section frequently call at Domestic Intelligence Division for
consultation, Arrangements were made for couriers representing certain
other sensitive agencies, such as National Security Agency and Central
Intelligence Agency, to call at Domestic Intelligence Division for the purpose
of delivering or receiving mail requiring protective services of armed couriers.

-3- ; 6-E

Thus, many of the functions formerly performed by Special Agent personnel
are handled by currently assigned personnel within the Division, resulting in
the savings of the time of the nine Agents released.

As a result of the Division-wide reorganization effected 12/16/70
this Section absorbed without offsetting Special Agent personnel work
relating to Chinese matters formerly assigned to three Special Agent
Supervisors in the Sino-Satellite Section (now abolished). This resulted in
an increased case load of over 25 percent.

(6) While there are 20 Agents assigned to the Section, two are

assigned to the Section Front Office and five to the Special Coordination

Unit, which handles remaining domestic liaison functions and all foreign
; liaison functions; thus, there are 13 Agents assigned to desks on which cases
7 are handled. The case load per Agent since the last inspection has increased
from 193 to 278, a 44 percent increase. This has been the result of cutting
back two Agents as result of the last insnection and the assignment of Chinese
work to the Section effective with the Division reorganization 12/16/70. There
has been insufficient time since the latter date to establish whether the
significant increase in case load per man will adversely affect the efficient
operation of the Section. At this time, however, no additional Agent personnel
is being requested for assignment to desks handling cases but the matter
will be closely followed and if recommendations in this connection are
considered appropriate in the future they will be submitted with justifying data.

At the present time there are five supervisory Special Agents
- assigned to the Special Coordination Unit and the heavy increase in work load
on the Foreign Liaison Desk (FLD} in that Unit (to which two of the five Agents
are assigned) has resulted in a situation warranting the assignment of two
additional Special Agents to the desk. In connection with this, following is
submitted: :

In December, 1970, our foreign liaison offices were expanded from
11 to 17. It has come at a time when the two FLD Supervisors have been
barely able to keep up with the flow of paper let alone actually examine and
analyze it in order to afford active and constructive supervision to our
foreign offices. This problem arises from two causes, (1) the heavy demands
made on the time of these two Supervisors in welcoming and personally
supervising the visits to the Bureau of the many foreign dignitaries who
are valuable and cooperative contacts of our Legal Attaches--such visitors

HW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 557

; nae 6-E

4
currently average 27 per month; and (2) the appreciable increase (62 percent)
in the past ten years of the Foreign Police Cooperation cases we handle.

The Legal Attache expansion in December, 1970, increased Bureau
personnel abroad from 60 to 88, of which latter number 42 are Special Agents.
The latest case load figures available for the 11 Legal Attache offices then
existing are for 10/31/70, at which time the 11 offices carried a total of
3,020 cases. In October, 1960, five Special Agent Supervisors were assigned
to the FLD, one of whom devoted a portion of his time to Buplans matters,
which matters have now been transferred to another Section. At that time
the case load for all foreign offices was 1693.

In October, 1960, we had 166 Foreign Police Cooperation cases on
the FLD. In October, 1970, there were 273. This large increase in Foreign
Police Cooperation cases was absorbed as a result of the delegation to a
clerical employee of supervisory responsibility for about 95 percent of the
cases. This clerical employee, who is in Grade GS-7, is most efficient and
quite capable but cannot be expected to have the experience of an Agent to
recognize promptly potentially embarrassing situations arising.

As we now have six new Legal Attache offices, we can expect both
the case load and the Foreign Police Cooperation requests to increase substantially.

The FLD Supervisors should be watching mail flow to determine

the promptiness with which Legal Attaches respond io requests; the thoroughness
of handling such cases; and the adequacy of foreign agency contacts ina

- position to afford the Bureau the desired degree of cooperation. The FLD
Supervisors should be preparing memoranda reflecting Legal Attache accomplish-
ments in order to keep the Director fully apprised of the truly excellent work
being done by our Agents abroad. As the situation now stands, the two present
FLD Supervisors just do not have time to do this and we are incurring the
risk of failing to afford direction and guidance in this very important area
of the Bureau's operations,

To comply with Bureau requirements our 42 men abroad must
seek cooperation of foreign agencies. In reciprocity they must accept
requests for investigations in the U. S, regarding matters as simple as running
down bad debtors to complex investigations involving the location of murder :
_ Suspects. The two present FLD Supervisors at this time, because of the

AW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 558 o



-5- 6-E

heavy demands on them, are unable to afford the necessary direction and
assistance to the clerical employee handling Foreign Police Cooperation
cases.

To afford the necessary and proper guidance to our foreign operations,
particularly to the six new offices which have now been established and which
will make heavy demands for immediate support, and to overcome the
present heavy work load described above, two additional Agent Supervisors,
preferably men having potential for foreign assignment, should be approved
for the FLD at this time.

(7) Criteria utilized in evaluating personnel adequacy include
continuing analysis of Agent and clerical work load, case load, mail counts,
complexity of cases, relative importance of matters to national security and
intelligence requirements, patterns of delinquency, personnel capabilities,
and past experience in shifts of emphasis of work from one area to another.

: Coeily ‘INSPECTOR E. 8, MILLER: During the course of this inspection
z ESM :wmj

V/ 22/71) thorough analyses of work were performe=
which have given some insight in the
supervision of work in your Division.

Taken into consideration was your recent reorganization of the Division
which appears to have accomplished a better balance of work between branches.

' In this write-up you have requested replacement Agents for SAs C. E.
_Enright.and GM. Quinn. both assigned in your Espionage and Racial ial Branch.
In addition, you have requested two ‘additional Agents for the Racial Intelligence
Section and two Agents for the Special Coordination Unit.’

Division case load was surveyed by categories from the field administrative
reports for a 12-month period (January through December, 1970) to establish
tends over this period. Dasically, portin: ted increases of
70, 2% in Internal Securityand New Left cases during the 12 month period; a
57.4% increase in racial matters; 34.9% in Security Informants; a decline of
33% in Espionage (65) and decline of 13, 3% in Internal Security - Nationalistic
Tendency (105) cases.

In addition, case loads by Section were reconstructed (in view of Division
reorganization) and compared with case loads at the time of the last inspection
as indicated in the following:

Last Inspection Current Inspection
Espionage 5846 * -5038 (-808)
Racial 4746 6642 (+1896)
Nationalities :

Intelligence 7 2944 3620 (+676) (Does not include
Internal Security 3658 5318 (+1660) Spec. Coordina-
New Left 6551 "6421 (-180) tion Unit)
Research No cases

To further analyze case and work load the Research Section and Special
Coordination Unit were excluded from computations and manpower was considered
on the basis of 50 men in the Espionage Racial Intelligence Branch and 33 men
in the Internal Security Branch(Section ChieSand Number One Men also excluded),

Total case load in Espionage Branch currently is 15, 300 and 11,739 in Internal
Security;case load per supervisor in Espionage determined to be 14% lower than

HW_55151__DocId; 32989638 Page 560 :



| — Bo e |

his counterpart in Internal Security (306 vs. 356). It is noted in this regard that
the Racial Intelligence case load raises the Espionage Branch figures, since the
Nationalities Intelligence Section has an average of only 278 and Espionage
Section of only 280 cases per man. The average in Racial Intelligence Section
is 350.

\

We next conducted surveys to determine whether the complexity of cases in
| Espionage and Nat ionalities work was appreciably more eomp ler to justify the
| above -noted differences in case load.

All pending 65 classification cases (total 327) were reviewed and it was
determined a total of 539 items of correspondence containing instructions
or direction emanating from SOG were contained in these files or an average
of 1. 6 pieces of correspondence in a 12-month period, Over half of this was
somewhat routine and very short.

We also reviewed the 100 most important (105s) cases and determined an
average of 3.37 pieces of correspondence originated at SOG in these files.
62% of this was considered somewhat routine,

We reviewed over 80% of your 298 Potential Double Agent cases and
~ determined the average case was 3 1/2 years old and contained only | piece
of correspondence in over 3 years (Subject of separate write-up).

Other surveys revealed current active cases in these categories had an
average of only 3+ pieces of correspondence in a 12-month period.

. It is felt that degree of supervision and the amount of instruction and
direction given our cases can be measured in one way by the frequency of
correspondence necessitated by the individual cases.

Another survey of mail signed out at Section level revealed that approximately
57% of your outgoing mail emanates from the combined efforts of your New Left
and Racial Sections. Espionage Section contributed about 8,7% and Nationalities
Intelligence about 15%. .

On the basis of the above studies and reviews of ‘files, T conclude that, if
anything, due to the intensity of the action that it requires more input to supervise
“Racial and New Left a it does cases assigned in the Espionage and Nationalities
Sections. : :

For this reason, I feel you still have an imbalance in your Division which should
be corrected. That is, you still have 5 men working Espionage and Nationalities

HW 55151 Doclda:32989638 Page 561 : 2 7 iH

work who should be shifted to other work to balance your
assignments, I do not feel that you need two more men in the
Special Coordination Unit at this time since increased work
load considerations due to the additional Legats has not yet
happened. When and if it does, you should make necessary
intra-Branch transfers.

I agree with your recommended replacements for SAs Enright
and Quinn; however, replacement for_Quinn should be assigned to
the Racial Section and not the Espionage Section, I am submitting
separate recommendations regarding this.

Any further additions to the Racial Intelligence Section
should be made from within the Espionage Branch from the
pertinent Sections.

To recap, I feel as a result of this inspection that your
present quota of 116 men is adequate. I feel the replacements
requested are justified but I do not agree with your request
for 4 additional Agents. 7

Comments of Assistant Directoy Byennan requested:

SSISTANT DIRECTOR C, D, srennan: (Prne Inspector has noted
.0(DEM:ekn - 1/23/71) - our recent reorganization
we 7 to accomplish a better
balance of work between
branches,

The reorganization was based on memorandum 10/9/70, Sizoo
‘to Brennan, requesting 6 additional Agent Supervisors and
memorandum 10/14/70, Mr, Felt to Mr. Tolson, denying this
request. Mr. Felt's memorandum noted there were 18921 cases
(excluding large volume of informants and Communist Party, USA,
matters) and based on our set up at that time the average case
load per Agent was 305 in the Internal Security Branch and 225
in the Espionage Branch, :

Details of the approach utilized in our reorganization,
12/16/70, are set forth in the attachment, With 116 Division
Agent complement and 83 desk agents (same figures utilized
during current inspection we distributed the Division case-
load (22,857 as of 10/31/70, or an average of 275 per desk
agent) as equitably as possible, This resulted in apportion-
ment of caseload among the six present sections as follows:

During the reorganization all work as well as cases formerly
handled in three sections in the Espionage Branch was consolidated into
two sections. All cases and work formerly handled in two operational
sections in the Internal Security Branch were spread among three sections
with the creation of the New Left Section as a separate entity. This
resulted in additional Agents for New Left work.

Since 10/31/70 (caseload figures utilized for reorganization
purposes) caseloads in each section have changed as follows:

Current

Section : 10/31/70 Inspection Net Change

Espionage 5099 5038 -61

Racial Intelligence 4948 6642 +1694

Nationalities Intelligence 3692 3620 -28
“Internal Security 3627 5318 +1691

New Left 5491 642t +930

Research 0 0 0

The slight reductions in caseloads in the Espionage and
Nationalities Intelligence Sections have left the average cases per Agent
at 280 and 278, respectively, both above the norm of 275 established for
reorganizational purposes.

The Inspector has noted the number of outgoing pieces of
correspondence in the 65 classification cases, the 100 most important
105 classification cases, and a review of 80 percent of 298, "potential double
agent" cases. The vast majority of the cases handled in the Espionage
and Nationalities Intelligence Sections are 105 classification cases.
Recognizing the Inspector reviewed the most important cases and determined
that on an average 3.37 pieces of correspondence originated at the Seat of

i ' i”

;Government in these files, I would estimate that a conservative minimum of
over two pieces of correspondence originated at Seat of Government in each
of the 105 classification group as a whole. With an average caseload of
280 per Supervisor, this would mean that 560 outgoing communications
would be submitted each year. Minus weekends and holidays, there are
252 workdays in a year and I would estimate an average of 32 days per

man would be accounted for by annual leave, sick leave, inspection assign-
ments, tour assignments, firearms and physical examinations. This would
leave 220 days for productive work per Supervisor. This would mean

that each Supervisor would be required to review the necessary files and
dictate approximately two and one-half communications per day. I feel this
is perhaps a conservative estimate inasmuch as many of the cases involved
relate to foreign diplomats and in each case, at the inception, we have to
prepare a communication to Department of State setting forth basic facts
about the individual and obtaining authority to investigate, and, thereafter,
issue appropriate instructions to the field. Thus, in these cases, there
are two outgoing communications prepared at the very inception.

In addition to measuring work on the basis of outgoing corres-
pondence, I think note must be taken of the fact that the Espionage and
Nationalities Intelligence Sections have a responsibility with regard to over
180 countries. The vast majority, of course, are of concern to the
Nationalities Intelligence Section. Supervisors on the various desks have
to be aware of conditions existing which affect the Bureau's responsibilities
in the intelligence field and this encompasses the review of much intelligence
material which shows up in the incoming mail count, all of which must be

. properly reviewed and coordinated.

During the inspection a mail count was kept for five days and
the results, of course, are available to the Inspector. In this connection,
during the five-day period, each Supervisor in the Espionage Section
received an average of 255 pieces of regular incoming mail (such as, Seat
of Government memoranda, letterhead memoranda, teletypes, airtels,
cables, letters from field, and letters from outside agencies) for a total
of 378 pages. Other incoming mail (such as intelligence reports and cables
ftom other agencies, Bureau Source 6 and Bureau Source 200 items,
publications, visa notifications and similar such items) averaged 40 items
per Agent in the Espionage Section and the pages totaled 213. With regard
to outgoing mail, there was an average per man of 11 items and 18 pages
of dictated material and 79 items and 157 pages of outgoing nondictated,
all of which involved preparation of material for dissemination to other
agencies. In the Nationalities Intelligence Section, the comparable average
figures per Supervisor were 213 items and 416 pages of incoming regular
mail, 109 items and 440 pages of other incoming mail, 22 items and 40
pages of outgoing dictated mail, and 68 items and 169 pages of outgoing
nondictated mail.

t The fact that the work on a desk is measured by more than just
r ! caseload can best be illustrated by citing figures of incoming and outgoing
mail for Special Coordination Unit, Nationalities Intelligence Section, for
which no case load is reported. In that Unit there were 1173 items
consisting of 1777 pages of regular incoming mail; 52 items consisting

of 137 pages of other incoming mail; 117 items consisting of 233 pages of
outgoing dictated mail; and 290 items consisting of 456 pages of outgoing
nondictated mail.

As can be seen from the above, since the time of reorganization
when equity in caseloads was established and manpower assignments made,
there has been no decrease in the amount of work responsibilities in the
Espionage and Nationalities Intelligence Sections. The December, 1970,
reorganization resulted in the assignment of significant extra work to those
two Sections. The substantial increases in caseloads in Racial Intelligence,
Internal Security and New Left Sections have resulted from the opening of
new investigations on members of basic revolutionary groups and the
removal of the moratorium on Security Index reporting, approved by the
Director, plus increased efforts in these areas by the field.

I feel a strong responsibility in our work in the Dam estic
Intelligence Division in connection with the national security of our country
and am concerned with the ever increasing number of officials from
communist countries assigned to the U. S. In addition, the President
has recently expressed his urgent need for better high-level coverage
which has resulted in expansion of our operations abroad and where possible
in the U. S.

Foregoing was taken into consideration in connection with my
request for additional personnel and you may be assured that whatever decision
is reached I and the men in my Division will do our utmost to fulfill our
responsibilities in all areas.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

ADDITION OF SUITABLE DESIGNATION

TO CAPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS PER-
TAINING TO CERTAIN RACIAL INFORM-
ANTS TO INSURE PROPER ROUTING OF

SUCH CORRESPONDENCE AT SOG,

INSPECTOR 4.MILLER: Prior to the reorganization of the
f lard Domestic Intelligence Division on
12-16-70, all informants reporting
on racial matters and white hate groups (including Ku Klux
Klan) were supervised by the Racial Informant and White
Hate Unit of the Racial Intelligence Section. All such

i informants are designated as Racial Informants. Subsequent
| to the reorganization of this Division, supervision of

i substantive matters pertaining to white hate groups and
corresponding informanis {$96}, is laidled by the Kian and
White Hate Groups Unit of the Internal Security Section.
Supervision of black nationalist organizations and related
informant cases (564) continues to be aia in the Racial
Intelligence Section.

As a result of the above, the Racial Intelligence

Section is receiving mail concerning racial informants who

- are reporting on white hate group activity. This mail
should be reviewed and handled by the Internal Security
Section. At the present time, it is not possible to
determine to which section such mail should be routed without
reviewing the content of the incoming correspondence since
the caption of communications pertaining to all racial
informants indicate only that a racial source is involved.
The type of activity:on which the informant reports -- black

| -nationalist as opposed to white hate groups -- is not set

forth in the caption.

In view of the fact that over 40% of the cases
pertaining to racial sources involve white hate groups, it
would appear desirable to identify such matters clearly in
the caption of communications submitted to the Bureau by the
field. This will permit such mail to be routed directly to
the Internal Security Section and will save an appreciable
amount of time in getting the mail to the section where it

o Gq

will be handled. Such an addition to the caption will
also preclude the necessity for the content of communica-
tions of this nature to be reviewed in the Racial
Intelligence Section.

'

It is believed the desired routing could be
effected by adding a characterization, such as White Hate
Group (abbreviated WHG), to the caption of correspondence
concerning informants who are reporting on the activities
of such'groups. Under existing procedure communications
concerning racial informants reporting on white hate groups
are submitted under a caption such as: CO 1234-R. Under
the suggested procedure the communication would be captioned:
CO 1234-R
(WHG) .

* Comments of Section Chiefs Gray and Moore and
Assistant Director Brennan are requested.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM
ARTICLES CONCERNING ACTIVITIES OF

RACIAL EXTREMISTS
RESEARCH SECTION

INSPECTOR<E AyD S. MILLER: The Research Section prepares a
number of timely monographs and
other studies dealing with the
activities of racial extremists. These papers, as well as

the daily teletype summary and the weekly "Summary of Extremist
Activities," serve to keep Bureau personnel, appropriate
government officials, and the intelligence community adviselon

the up~to-date situation involving these matters.

“ Much information received is from public sources or
“otherwise of a non-confidential nature, The, Bureau is in a
unique position to collate and place in perspective the in-
formation concerning activities of these violence-prone ex-
ytremists. This data could be used for preparation of articles
for publication in magazines, journals, and newspapers whicn
would serve to expose these individuals and organizations for.
what they are. Such articles would give the public an insight‘
into the true nature of these extremists who would destroy our
system of government and our society. This would serve to
diminish public sympathy and support for their activities and
-would strengthen public support of law enforcement in general.

Although the Bureau has prepared and/or been in-
strumental in the publication of a number of articles concerning
the campus revolutionaries of the New Left and of whitehate
groups, the only recent material we have made available to the
public concerning racial extremist activities is that set forth
in the Appropriations testimony. There is a definite need for
good, timely articles for public consumption placing in per- ‘
spective and showing the true nature of the activities of racial
extremists, The Crime Records Division has sources available

‘to facilitate publication of such material.

SUGGESTION

It is suggested that Research Section, with the
assistance of and in coordination with the Crime Records Division,
correlate the preparation and publication of articles dealing

taken to use only material of a non-confidential nature which
would not be detrimental to Bureau operations. Consideration
should be given to a study of the Black Panther Party along

the lines of the article entitled "A Study of Marxist Revolutionary
Violence; SDS, 1962-1969" which effectively exposed the SDS.

Other articles, perhaps shorter and more limited in scope, on

specific activities and groups also should be conSidered at an

CASE SUGGESTION WRITE-UP

EQBAL AHMAD |
SECURITY MATTER - MISCELLANEOUS
BUREAU FILE; 100-448675

PECTOR EDWARD S. MILLER: This case was originally
opened on 1/25/68 ‘based
apon Albany letter to the Director dated 1/19/68,
requesting Bureau authority to institute an investigation
of the subject based upon his antidraft and anti-Vietnam
protest activities. At the time, subject was also
considered to be a campus leader and agitator at_Cornell
University, Ithaca, New, York, where he was employed as
an assistant professor in the school of_Industrial and.

Labor Relations.

Ahmad has subsequently become involved in the
East Coast Conspiracy to Save Lives (ECCSL) and is
presently under indictment as one of the coconspirators
in this matter. (The ECCSL involves a conspiracy by a
dissident’ group of priests, nuns, teachers, students and
former students who have displayed opposition to the
Vietnam War by committing acts of violence against
Government agencies, including selective service boards
and private corporations.) The leaders of the ECCSL,
one of whom is Ahmad, planned to destroy underground
electric and heating systems serving Government buildings
in Washington, D. C. The group also has reportedly
planned to kidnap a high Government official and_Ahmad
was a key figure in this phase.

Set forth below is a brief summary of background
information taken from the subject's file:

Eqbal Ahmad

INS records further indicate that Ahmad first came
to the United States in September, 1957, on a trip
financed by a Fulbright Travel Grant and that Occidental
College at Los Angeles, California, provided this
fellowship. His sponsor was the Institute of International
Education. In September, 1958, Ahmad transferred to
Princeton University on a university fellowship and
remained there until September, 1961, when he left the
United States to take up residence in North Africa. INS
records indicate that Ahmad last arrived in the United States
at New York City on September 21, 1963, destined for
Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, on a teaching
fellowship. INS files also set forth prior residences at
Lahore, Pakistan; Los Angeles, California; Tunis, Tunisia;
Urbana, Illinois, and Ithaca, New York. Former employments
include "lecturer in Modern History" at Forman Christian
College and the Pakistan Military Academy in Pakistan as
well as teaching assignments at Princeion University,
University of Illinois and Cornell University.

He was registered inabsentia during 1961 and 1962
and during this time was in Morocco and Tunisia. He was
awarded a Ph.D. degree on June 13, 1967, by Princeton
University.

On January 14, 1969, the Chicago Office determined

1 that Ahmad was employed at the time by the Adlai E, Stevenson

Institute of International Affairs (ASIIA), 5757 South
Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Ahmad was listed as a
recipient of funds for study in Vietnam for the period
1968-69.

In July, 1968, the Albany Division reported that
information was developed indicating that the subject proposed
to travel to North and South Vietnam. It is further noted
that Ahmad was leaving Cornell University because of failure

i to have his contract renewed. He indicated in a published

article of the "Cornell Daily Sun" that he would travel to

| North and South Vietnam during the 1968-69 academic year

as a fellow of the Center for International Studies of the

; University of Chicago. The article further reported that

| Ahmad would carry press cards from a Pakistani newspaper and
two Algerian newspapers. He was identified as a person active

4 in the antiwar movement at Cornell University.

Eqbal Ahmad

On July 12, 1968, Ahmad's former landlord at
Ithaca, New York, advised that the subject told him that
he would travel to Vietnam in September, 1968, in order
to study and report upon the war. Ahmad reportedly said
that this study would be within his field of interest
since he has been conducting research on guerrilla warfare
and revolutions.

Language Ability

Subject reportedly speaks fluent English, Urdu,
French, Arabic, Persian and Hindustani.

Revolutionary Background

On May 8, 1965, an issue of the "Daily Illini,"

a daily student newspaper published at the University of
Iilinois, Champaign-Urbana campus, illinois, Listed the
participants in a local "teach-in" on the war in Vietnam
to be held on Mary 15, 1965. One of the speakers was
identified as Eqbal Ahmad, assistant professor of political
science who was described as an expert on guerrilla and
internal warfare who had worked with the anti-French FLN
guerrillas during the Algerian independence struggle and
who reportedly had studied guerrilla movements all over
* the world,

_Ahmad's file cites numerous instances of Ahmad's
involvement in antidraft and anti-Vietnam demonstrations
and activities as well as numerous anti-American statements
made by him. During his subsequent association with the
ECCSL, Ahmad has been one of the prime movers in the plot
to kidiap "a high Government official and appears to have
played an increasingly important role as a leader and
advisor of the ECCSL.

In view of the foregoing information, the following
suggestions are set forth for your consideration and
appropriate action:

1. _Eqbal Ahmad appears to have the potential
qualities (background, intelligence, education, experience
and linguistic ability) of a foreign intelligence agent,

AW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 582 = 4/3



Eqbal Ahmad
rere

It is suggested that consideration be given to issuing
instructions to the field to institute an intensive

full field investigation of this subject particularly
with respect to his national origin, travel and residences
in foreign countries and involvement in foreign political
activities.

If investigation abroad so justifies, it is
suggested that consideration be given to intensifying
our investigation of the subject to include the establishment
of sources or informants close to him. Physical
surveillance and the development of highly confidential
sources should not be overlooked in effecting full
coverage of Ahmad's current activities.

This background investigation should insure that
emphasis is placed on developing information concerning
Abmadis income and tinancial aitairs, verification of
Subject’s travel to South and/or North Vietnam in
1968-69 and subject's activities in the Los Angeles,
California, area during the period of his attendance at

Occidental College at Los Angeles.

You should insure the field aggressively intensifies
‘this background investigation, yet it should be emphasized
that utmost discretion and good judgment should be
exercised to avoid unfounded charges of "harassment" being
directed against the Bureau.

The above suggestions are not to be considered as
all-inclusive; however, you should insure that this matter
receives close personal supervision.

? {SPECTOR EDWARD S, MILLER: The DESECO Program (development
of selected contacts to be directed against Soviet-bloc
officials) has been operated with considerable success

since it was implemented as a result of an espionage conference
in 1957, As a result of this program, a substantial number

of security informants and double agents have been developed.

Simultaneous with the imminent opening of the Chinese

It is recognized that certain steps have previously

been taken with a view toward developing double agents and

informants among the Chicoms. These include contacts with

certain Chinese scientists working in strategic technical

fields in the U.S., as well as efforts to develop some ethnic
Chinese sources who might be targeted against the Chicoms. It
would appear that these programs should be expanded and
intensified with a view toward developing an aggressive effort
directed at the Chicoms and patterned after the DESECO program,
This program should include persons who by the nature of their
‘occupation, national origin, or otherwise might be logical

‘ targets of the Chicoms or would have occasion or opportunity
to be in touch with the Chicoms. This program would include
journalists, students, educators, politicians, librarians,
travel agents and the like.

The present "Defector Program" operates as follows:
"Defector committees" consisting of Espionage desk Supervisors

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM
MAXIMUM UTILIZATION OF GHETTO INFORMANTS

‘OR EDWARD S, MILLER: Since the implementation
(ote of the Ghetto Informant

egram in 1967, it has developed into a productive source of
accomplishments for the Bureau. Experience has shown that in
addition to being mere listening posts for black extremist
action, these informants, when motivated by specific assign-
ments, also furnish valuable criminal information. As a
result of conferences held at the Seat of Government, ‘the
field was instructed in March, 1970, to give more positive
assignments to ghetto informants. The Director noted, "This
is most important."

- The number of ghetto ‘informants now stands at more
than 6,200, and it is essential that we continually make certain
we are achieving maximum results from this vast reservoir of
information, It is believed one additional step toward this
goal would be the giving of more specific assignments to brandi
ghetto informants, especially cencerning black oxtrem
living in their locality, such as subjects on the Security
Index and selected Agitator Index subjects with extremist
tendencies. Such assignments would include the development
of detailed information concerning black extremist targets

“such as data relating to their daily activities, sources of income,
and information as to whether the black extremists are operating
in violation of Federal or local statutes. Ghetto informants

+ would be assigned to black extremist targets with whom they are

acquainted or who reside or work in the same area. It is also
probable that in many instances ghetto informants could also 7
be targeted against similar subjects of interest to the New

Left Program.

Based on our experience to date, there appears to
be little doubt but what these additional specific assignments,
if fully implemented throughout the field, would not only
increase our intelligence coverage of black extremists, but
could also be the vehicle for putting more of these militants
in jail on criminal charges, The success of this approach
would, of course, be commensurate with the enthusiasm of the
individual Agents in the field and it is necessary that pressure
be kept on it. A suggested means for checking on the Program's
progress at the Seat of Government would be to amend Form
FD-405 under the heading "Racial Informant Accomplishments"
to require the field to specifically list major accomplishments
attributable to ghetto informants during the previous month,

fi INSPECTOR EDWARD S. MILLER: The Racial Intelligence Section

furrently utilizes Form FD-405 (copy attached), captioned
"Status Report, Racial Informants, Extremist Groups
(White-Black); Racial Matters." The form is submitted by
the field quarterly, and it requires a detailed breakdown of
militant black extremist groups, ghetto area, and indicates
the specific informant coverage, including member informants,
for each group and area, in addition to informationrequired
for white extremist groups. A complete listing is furnished
quarterly and only pertinent changes are furnished by the
field as they occur during interim months.

The FD-405s are handled centrally by the Black
Nationalist - South and Racial Informant Unit and are
furnished to Bureau Supervisors handling the substantive
case on each organization listed for timely evaluation of
inforvitant development aid coverage in each fisld soffics.
This enables the Bureau Supervisor to detect weaknesses quickly
and take appropriate corrective measures,

It is suggested that in order to provide tighter
accountability for member informant development and coverage,
FD-405 be revised to include an additional section to state
as follows:

"Explain why you do not have member informants in
those groups listed in columns #1 and #3 on FD-405a,.

"Indicate what specific action is being taken to
develop member informants in those groups and advise when
member informant coverage is anticipated for each group."

ADDENDUM Yy_7
SECTION CHIEF GEORGE C, MOORE,
1/20/71

The suggestion made by the Inspector will definitely
enable the Racial Intelligence Section to afford closer
supervision to the important task of developing quality
racial informants especially member informants in extremist
organizations.

Our present practice of reviewing the FD-405 and
then communicating to the field when it is noted there is
no member informant in extremist organizations will be
streamlined by the suggestion made by the Inspector. In
view of the above, appropriate instructions will be issued
to comply with the Inspector's suggestion.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR CHARLES

will be issued to comply with the Inspector's suggestion,

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM
SUPERVISION AND CONTROL OF SECURITY
INFORMANT DEVELOPMENT AND COVERAGE BY
INTERNAL SECURITY AND NEW LEFT SECTIONS

ENSPECTOR EDWARD S, MILLER: Each field office currently
submits an annual report on all security informants and
confidential sources, advising which informants are paid
regularly. The report lists the subversive organizations
currently under investigation by that office and includes
the following basic information: address of organization,
character of case, field file number, Bureau file number,
approximate membership. The report also lists informant
coverage of each organization as follows: officers -
‘Rank and File - other.

In addition, quarterly reports on the"New Left
Movement" are submitted by the field. These reports list
informant coverage of New Left groups but do not specify
which are member informants.

Additionally, Bureau airtel to all offices dated
11/5/70, captioned "Informant Development, Black Panther
Party, New Left Groups ," ordered a complete analysis of
informant coverage in the Black Panther Party and New Left
groups by each office in the field. This is not a regularly
scheduled analysis.

It is noted that the Racial Intelligence Section
currently utilizes FD-405, (copy attached), captioned
"Status Report, Racial Informants, Extremist Groups (White-
Black); Racial Matters." It is submitted by the field
quarterly and requires a detailed breakdown of militant
black extremist groups, ghetto area, and indicates the
specific informant coverage, including member informants,
for each group and area, in addition to information required
for white extremist groups. A complete listing is furnished
quarterly and only pertinent changes are furnished by the field
as they occur during the interim months,

The FD-405s are handled centrally in the Black
Nationalist - South and Racial Informant Unit and are routed
to Bureau Supervisors handling the substantive case on each
organization listed for timely evaluation of informant development
and coverage in each field office. This enables the Bureau
Supervisor to detect weaknesses and take timely corrective measures,

{18/71

The immediacy of the need for member informant
coverage in all extremist organizations is obvious if the
Bureau is to be forewarned of plans for bombings, kidnappings,
demonstrations, and other acts of violence in this country.

It is suggested that the New Left and Internal
Security Sections devise a form similar to the FD-405,designed
to fit the unique requirements of those Sections, which will
assist Supervisors to more accurately evaluate and control
informant development and coverage in the field. The form
should require specific information on member informant develop-
ment and coverage in each revolutionary, New Left, extremist,

-and protest group under investigation in each field office.

In devising the new form, the New Left and Internal Security
Sections should bear in mind the suggestion which has been
proposed separately for the Racial Intelligence Section

to revise FD-405 by-adding a section to read as follows:

"Explain why you do not have member informants in
those grouns listed in columns #1 and #3 on FD-405a.

"Indicate what specific action is being taken to
develop member informants in those groups and advise when
member informant coverage is anticipated for each group."

FD-405 also lists statistical accomplishments
attributable to racial and ghetto informants. FD-374 is

‘used for criminal informants. This information is tabulated

by computer in the Voucher-Statistical Section and is
available for immediate reference, including use by the
Director in his Budget Testimony,

While not ordinarily engaged in criminal activity
to the same extent as criminal, racial, or ghetto informants,
it is nevertheless true that security informants, especially
in the New Left field, are increasingly responsible for
statistical accomplishments each year. These include
location of Bureau fugitives, recovery of stolen merchandise,
and other similar data, It can be reasonably anticipated
that they will be responsible for additional statistical
accomplishments in the future, There is no current procedure
for compiling and recording this type of statistical data
by the New Left or Internal Security Sections.

receive full credit for statistical accomplishments attributable
to all FBI informants, the new form devised by the New Left

SECTION CHIEFS SHACKELFORD, WANNALL AND cant The Inspector's
suggestion appears to have merit. The New Left, Nationalities
Intelligence and Internal Security Sections agree that FD-405
could be adapted to fit security informant evaluation in the
New Left movement and in basic revolutionary organizations and
related groups. It is proposed that representatives of each

of these three sections implement the Inspector's suggestion

by revising the form for security use and preparing the
necessary instructions to the field requiring quarterly sub-
mission of this informant status report concerning organizations
under investigation. Coordination, routing and statistical
compilation of the incoming forms would be the responsibility

of the Special Records Unit of the Research Section which
maintains security informant records but the substantive
sections involved would be responsible for evaluation and any
necessary action on the basis of their content, It is believed
further that should this procedure meet our needs for evaluation
of member security informants, we should consider the elimination
of the annual security informant report now submitted by each
field office. It is proposed, therefore, that this suggestion
be implemented for a six-month trial period (two submissions)

to determine its feasibility and whether it does meet our needs
for member informant evaluation. At the end of that trial
period, the results will be analyzed and a commensurate
recommendation submitted.

. ° ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C. D. BRENNA I agree that it would be
(JAS:sjr - 1/21/71). . desirable to carry out this

trial basis to determine its feasibility. I will follow this

you make your trial period at least one year,

VENCEREMOS BRIGADE

Fs Me EDWARD S, MILLER: The Venceremos Brigade (VB)

originated with a group of
Americans who traveled to Cuba in January, 1969, to take
part in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the
Cuban revolution. The national organization of the VB
obtained support from a wide spectrum of leftist organizations
including the Communist Party, Socialist Workers Party, and
the Progressive Labor Party, as well as violent revolutionary
groups such as the Black Panther Party, La Raza (a militant
Mexican-American civil rights group), and the Weatherman
faction of the Students for a Democratic Society.

The idea of aiding Fidel Castro in meeting his
proposed quota of harvesting ten million tons of cane sugar
for 1970 quickly took the fancy of the young revolutionaries.’
Two hundred sixteen young Americans went to Cuba in November,
1969, to cut sugar cane and returned on February 11, 1970,
The second contingent of 687 American youths left New Brunswick,
Canada, on Febrrary 12, 1970, ah aa converted Cuban cattle
boat and returned on April 28, 1970. The third contingent of
407 individuals sailed for Cuba aboard the Conrado Benitez
on August 25, 1970. They returned to New Brunswick, Canada,
on October 21, 1970, Presently a fourth group is being formed
to leave on or about March 1, 1971, to stay in Cuba until
approximately May 15, 1971.

‘ While no evidence has been received that those persons
who traveled to Cuba received guerrilla warfare training in
Cuba, they were constantly told that they were the vanguard of
the revolution in the United States. They were told the only
way to defeat the imperialistic Government of the United States,
which must be overthrown, is through revolution,

Under the current instructions individual cases are
opened to locate, interview, and recommend placement on the
Security Index’on each person who traveled to Cuba. The SAC
may authorize the interview except where the person is under
2: years, is currently a student or professor, has some connection
with an institute of learning, or is a journalist. In these
instances Bureau authority must be obtained for the interview.
Investigation of these persons, under the current instructions,
is that the case remain open for one year with 90-day verifications
of residence and employment after their interview, The purpose
is to determine whether their inclusion on the Security Index

Hf after the interview is warranted. :

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION INSPECTION
1/20/71

a PID smaz

Venceremos Brigade

To date, less than half of the VB members have been
located and a large portion of those located have been
uncooperative insofar as the interview is concerned, Over
100 of these persons have been placed on the Security Index,
and it is anticipated that numerous others willbe listed.

Many have been arrested for engaging in acts of violence since
their return, have participated in anti-Vietnam demonstrations,
or demonstrated at trials involving members of the Black Panther
Party or the persons involved in the October, 1969, "days of

rage" indictments in Chicago, Illinois.

It is proposed that prior to closing any of the VB
cases after the interview and a year of following the
individual's activity on a 90-day reporting basis, he be
interviewed a second time. For those who were initially
cooperative, we should make every effort possible to convert
these persons as informants, Those who were initially
unccoporative should be considered for Priority II handling,
and those who have met the requirements for Security Index
inclusion in the initial stage should be re-evaluated to insure
they still meet those requirements.

Since the members of the VB have made blatantly
false statements in their passport applications by not
disclosing their true destination, a technical violation of

. the law exists. In addition, many of the applications

contained either false or out-of-date information including
incorrect or old addresses and places of-employment. These
technical violations and items of incorrect information should
be brought to the attention of Assistant Attorney General
Robert C. Mardian who has recently been appointed in charge of
the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice,

He, together with Attorney General John N, Mitchell and

James O, Eastland, United States Senator from Mississippi,

has- publicly indicated they were considering some antisubversion
pills making it a crime to give aid and comfort to the enemy,
particularly the North Vietnamese who had representatives in
Cuba to meet the VB, and toughening the law against advocating
the overthrow of the Government. The passport violations could
certainly be reviewed and brought under their consideration for
prosecution under current laws or for new legislative proposals.

Inasmuch as some of the VB members have indicated
they were going underground and the fact that a majority have

not been located for interview, you should consider placing
name stops in the Identification Division so that if these
persons are arrested or an inquiry is made by local law
enforcement authorities this fact will be immediately brought
to the attention of the Bureau, In addition, a stop file is
now being set up by the NCIC Unit for persons other than
fugitives concerning whom the Bureau has an interest. This
file will require, in addition to the name and birth date of
the individual, as many other items of identification as
possible such as his fingerprint classification, Social

. Security number, military service number, Selective Service
number, and the like,

Every effort should be made to utilize stops with
the Identification Division and the NCIC Unit on these persons.

We should continue to impress upon the field the
need for informants amcng the VB greups and insure that
coverage of the fourth.contingent is at least at the level
of the second contingent (five informants) and the third
contingent (four informants) . Be sure that all efforts are
made to have informants previously refused for passage with
the prior contingents, as well as those nine informants who
have previously traveled with the second and third contingents,
be considered for the currently proposed trip. liso, sufficient

- other new informants should be proposed so that coverage of
this latest contingent will be adequate for the Bureau's
intelligence needs.

VENCEREMOS BRAGA)

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR C.D, BRENNAN: “The Inspector's keen

analysis and thoughtful
suggestions in regard to the investigation of the
Venceremos Brigade (VB) is sincerely appreciated. In
connection with the above, the following observations by
this Division are set forth:

1. As the Inspector is aware, security
investigations are being conducted concerning each participant -
of the VB. These investigations require that background
data including any prior subversive activities be ascertained,
each individual participant be considered for interview, and
that the field make a recommendation as to the inclusion of
each VB subject on the Security Index (SI). Upon conclusion
of the above, the field is to advise the Bureau each 90 days
for a period of one year as to the whereabouts and activities
Gi Priority II, Priority ITI, 9nd any non-SI sub;iects who are
VB returnees. Priority I VB subjects are regarded as
extremists and this Bureau is notified each 45 days of their
activities and whereabouts.

- 2, As to the difficulty in locating VB returnees,
it is to be noted that the first and second contingents of
the VB were comprised of approximately 900 individuals made
up of young revolutionaries who were college dropouts leading
nomadic and communal existences. This mode of living inherently
makes the Bureau's job of locating these subjects for purpose of
interview more difficult. In contrast, investigation to date
of the third contingent, which was composed mostly of
established college students, indicates that these individuais
will be more easily located. Since the third contingent
returned to the U.S, approximately 90 days ago, these
investigations as to background data are now being completed
and the initial interviews will be promptly conducted.

3. The suggestion that these subjects be reinterviewéd

upon the expiration of above-mentioned one year period, will

be given serious consideration and instructions to this

effect will be issued to the field upon approval of the
Director. Efforts will be made to develop as informants those
VB subjects who are cooperative and the need for further
investigative attention regarding uncooperative individuals

will be evaluated on the merits of each individual case.

4. Regarding foreign travel such as that in which
the VB is engaged, it is recognized that the best interests
of this country would undoubtedly be served by prohibition
of such travel. The Internal Security Act of .1950 contained z
sanctions restricting travel on the part of Communist Party
members. After extended litigation, the Supreme Court in
dune, 1958, ruled in the Kent and Briehl vs. Dulles passport
case that the State Department could no longer deny passports
to individuals with past history of subversive affiliations.
In June, 1964, the Supreme Court in the Flynn - Aptheher
passport case ruled that the right of U.S. citizens to travel
abroad is protected by the due process clause of the 5th
Amendment. In January, 1967, in the Laub decision specifically
dealing with travel to Cuba, the Supreme Court ruled that the
State Department could not confiscate an individuals passport
simply because the individual traveled to Cuba without
State Department sanction. In December, 1967, in the Lynd
decision, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, ruled
that anyone can travel to a restricted country if they did not use
their passport to enter that country.

A’number of bills have been introduced into Congress
in recent years to remedy the above situation, most of which
have never cleared committee. The Senate currently has a

, bill, the Eastland Bill, before the Senate to impose criminal

penalties for violation of travel restrictions. A pending
bill, H.R. 1493, was in December, 1969, introduced to restrict
travel in violation of area restrictions. This bill has. been
sponsored by approximately 20 Congressmen. In view of the
above, this Division has not considered it warranted to suggest
additional legislation along: these lines.

5. As to technical violations regarding false or
erroneous Statements made by members of the VB on passport
applications, all information developed along these lines has
been furnished both to the Department of Justice and the
Department of State for whatever action they deem feasible.

To date neither Department has requested that additional action
be taken in this matter.

6. The Inspector's suggestion regarding the placing
of name stops with the Identification Division and the NCIC
Unit for information concerning hard-to-locate VB members, is
well taken. This Division will coordinate this matter with
NCIC to determine what information is necessary to place

|such stops and the manner in which this can best be effected.

Instructions will be issued to the field regarding

23

|
Venceremos Brigade \

implementation of this suggestion,

7. The VB is currently formulating plans for a
fourth contingent to travel to Cuba approximately March 1,
1971. By airtel dated January 6, 1971, interested field
divisions were instructed to immediately initiate an
aggressive campaign to obtain informants to travel to Cuba
as part of this contingent. These offices were instructed
to advise the Bureau no later than 1/29/71 and weekly
thereafter as to their progress in this matter. This
Division is acutely aware of the importance of such informant
coverage and will afford this program close attention.

“i
Ase CTOR E, S, MILLER: You should bear in mind that the
Ds ay attitude and instructions expressed
{g-PdD: bah by the President, the Director, and
1/22/71 many of the legislators in Congress

have been to curtail the militant
actions and the violent activities on the part of a significant
group of young people in the United States today. The thinking
of the Supreme Court of the United States with its several
recent changes may be along the lines of suppressing the
activities of those who so openly espouse the overthrow of all
forms of democratic authority in the United States. In
addition, the Internal Security Division of the Department
of Justice has been specifically enlarged and strengthened to
deal with these matters. It is recognized that individual
violations of the passport laws have been brought to the
attention of the Department of Justice in prior times. It
might be well to consider presenting the matter in its entirety
to the Department showing the number and frequency of violations
for their consideration and study.
M We cannot overlook or minimize the fact that over
1,300 individuals have willingly and freely gone to Cuba,
contrary to the State Department's specific instructions.
These persons left in many instances with the impression that
they would be trained in the use of revolutionary weapons
including explosives and incendiary devices. They were subjected

potential Cuban insurgents.

By communication to WFO dated 6/20/69 the Bureau instructed that coverage
of subject be intensified to determine the identities of any Agents he may be
operating.

: By communication dated 8/4/69 WFO advised Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Seattle Field Offices concerning identity and background of subject,
furnished each office with a photograph of subject, and set forth additional
investigative leads, The same WFO communication requested Bureau authority
to conduct active investigation of subject including Fisurs when deemed appropriate,
following clearance with U. S. Department of State.

On 9/2/69 the Bureau, with approval of U. S. Department of State, instructed
WFO to proceed with the investigation.

- Subsequent to 9/2/69 WFO and those offices listed above conducted active
investigation of subject and promptly furnished results in a form § suitable for
dissemination to the Bureau. :

In a progress memorandum to the Bureau dated 6/8/70, WFO advised that "PSI
Bokinsky has agreed to attempt to contact Klasa on a social basis." This
information is not substantiated in the PSI file (134-19651) nor was the proposal
to use the PSI acknowledged in any communication from the Bureau.

Bokinsky, is now employed by Fenner Pontiac in Rockvil He, .Maryland., It is
noted that this information is not in the PSI file, the Baltimore Divi
not advised, and no action was taken by the Bureau,

It is noted that the last Bureau communication to WFO in this matter is
dated 9/2/69 granting authority to conduct Fisurs as may be necessary to
determine if subject is engaged in intelligence activities.

It would appear that this entire investigation to date has lacked proper

UNIT CHIEF HOWARD H. WALLACE, RA . The Inspector's comments
EW: bew P7987 Fe relate! to the attempted

development of a security
informant, an automobile mechanic, for the purpose of providing
better coverage of the activities of a Polish intelligence
officer assigned to the Polish Embassy. This development is
proceeding because the mechanic is in contact with the intelli-
gence officer in connettion With repair of, theofficer's
automobile.

It is our policy to develop as many assets of all
types as necessary to provide coverage of the activities of
active Polish intelligence personnel. The Manual of Instructions,
Section 1O7A, page 3, defines various types of sources (confi-
dential sources, potential security informants, security informants,
and double agents) developed for use in these types of investi-
gations, The term "potential double agent" is not a status
defined in the Manual. It is rather an administrative term
used to distinguish a source being used against an intelligence
officer when the source has not as yet been solicited to handle
assignments for that officer but appears fo haye the notential
for such functions if requested.

: Bokinsky was designated a potential security informant
by the Bureau on TTI. ‘The Manual of Instructions, Section
107K, 7, page 13, provides that correspondence in security
informant and potential security informant cases should be
strictly limited to the administrative handling of the informant
and should not contain information more properly furnished under
' the substantive case caption, The six-month justification for
the subject's status as a potential security informant (per SAC
Letter 68-47, 8/20/68) is contained in WFO letter 1/19/71.

The relationship of Bokinsky to Kiasa is developing
in a normal pattern and at a pace consistent with avoiding
suspicion that he is under our control. Bureau supervision
has determined this through the case on Klasa, the Polish
intelligence officer against whom the potential security informant
is targeted. In that regard, a 90-day evaluation letter in the
Klasa case was submitted by WFO on 9/8/70 which stated that
attempts were continuing to have the potential security informant
placed in contact with Klasa. The potential security informant
was to contact Klasa and advise him of his new employment at
Fenner Pontiac, Rockville, Maryland, Again, by 90-day evaluation
letter dated 12, O'WrO"adviséd the potential security informant
had been in contact with Klasa concerning an automobile repair.
As a result, Klasa had requested potential security informant
to handle the repair of Polish Embassy's automobiles whenever
necessary, It was Stated that the potential Security

avy

informant would attempt to maintain contact with Klasa through
the entre of automobile service. It is respectfully submitted
that a review of both cases, thé potential security informant
and the intelligence officer against whom he is targeted,
shows that these matters were afforded proper supervision at
the Seat of Government.

2. The field has and must have the primary responsi-
bility for development and direction of potential security
informants against communist intelligence officers. The nature
and intensity of the direction of such potential security
informants must be commensurate with the apparent authenticity
of the informant's relationship to and course of conduct with
the intelligence officer against whom he is targeted. Over the-
years it has been firmly established from both investigative
experience and information obtained from defectors that anyone
who is aggressively cultivating an intelligence officer is
automatically suspected as being under the control of opposition
intelligence and, therefore. a provocateys, In instant case
Bokinsky's logical entre to Klasa is Klasa's need for_mechanical
work on his and the Embassy's automobiles. Given time and

“cultivation ao is being done Accordingto- 90-day letters being
received in the Klasa case he may develop a rapport or relation-
ship with Klasa THat~could result in his being upgraded to a
security informant. Reviews of the Bokinsky, file and the 90-day
letters in the Kiasa file show this matter is progressing

’ normally and at a tempo in line with the facts of the relation-
ship existing as well as normal experience in these matters.
Therefore, it is believed there is no lack of proper supervision
at the Seat of Gevernment.

3. It is respectfully submitted that there was no
necessity for the Seat of Government to instruct the office of
origin to disseminate to Baltimore information concerning
Bokinsky and to obtain verification of his employment change
as these items were covered in investigation. As a matter of
long-standing policy WFO has the responsibility for developing
and handling source coverage against communist intelligence
officers assigned to diplomatic establishments in the Washington,
D.C,, area even though the source may live or work in suburban
Maryland or Virginia. Review of the Bokinsky file shows that
WFO by letter dated 3/17/70 to the Biréau™ stated that there was
no record of information concerning Bokinsky available to the

| NW 55151 DocId:32989638 Page 615 24s



Baltimore Office. This indicated to the Bureau Supervisor

at the time that an interoffice communication had been sent

to Baltimore by WFO. A check with WFO on 1/22/71 disclosed
that by interoffice letter 11/6/69 it had advised Baltimore
that Bokinsky was being considered for development as a
potential security informant by WFO. His employment,
residence and date of birth were set forth and indices check
was requested. By interoffice letter 12/12/69 Baltimore
advised WFO that its indices were negative. Subsequent
verification of Bokinsky's change of employment was unnecessary
when same was prought to the attention of the Bureau in 90-day
evaluation letter submitted under the Klasa caption on 9/8/70,
and again in 90-day evaluation letter of 1277/70. No separate
communication was required for the informant file regarding
the change of employment because that information would he
furnished in the normal six-month ijustification submitted

by WFO and it does appear in the six-month justification
dated 1/19/71.

SECTION CHIEF A.W. cray fr concur with the explanation of
AWG: bew 1/22/71 SA Wallace, In accordance with

existing instructions, normal
procedures and at a pace consistent with security require-
ments and our experience in these matters, I respectfully

- By communication to Newark, the Bureau on 1/6/70 instructed that office
to interview subject "in accordance with existing instructions relating to
interviews of security subjects” to evaluate his potential with regard to furnishing
- information regarding Azaryan, The Bureau further instructed Newark in the
same communication to furnish results in a form suitable for dissemination.

Newark by communication to the Bureau dated 2/12/70 set forth background
information relative to subject (in memorandum form, not suitable for dissemination
as instructed by the Bureau) and stating information contained therein would be
furnished in LHM form under the Azaryan caption.

On 3/31/70 the Newark Office advised under the Azaryan caption and not the

OFFICE OF ORIGIN - NEW YORK
NEW YORK OFFICE FILE ~ 105-97980
NEWARK OFFICE FILE - 105-25293
BUREAU FILE - 105-184321 .

The subject of this investigation first came to the attention of the Bureau
in August, 1968, via a U. S. Department of State communication advising that
the subject had been issued a visa to enter the U. S. as an employee of ihe Amtorg
Trading Corporation, NYC. New York, At that time Bureau communication to NYO
dated 8/14/ 68 instructed that office to be alert to subject's arrival and handle
in accordance with Section 105 K, Manual of Instructions.

Subsequent to that time the NYO and auxiliary offices conducted extensive
investigation including discreet Fisurs and kept the Bureau advised of their
progress by letter dated 12/9/68. In this same communication, a request was
intensified investigation of subject including surveillances when necessary. The
Bureau by communication to U. S. Department of State dated 1/3/69 sought such
authority which was subsequently granted by State 1/22/69. The subject has been
under constant investigation by the NYO since that time with a free exchange of
information between the NYO and the Bureau,

The Newark Office advised the Bureau by communication dated 3/31/70
that Nelson, the PSI, had been interviewed, the results of which were furnished
the Bureau in LHM form dated 4/8/70, The results of the interview were furnished
U. S. Department of State, CIA, Commerce and the U. S. Information Agency.

On 4/17/70 Newark Office again furnished results of contact by PSI Nelson
with the subject in LHM form suitable for dissemination.

On 6/17/70 Newark reported another contact by PSI Nelson with the subject.

The NYO advised the Bureau by LHM dated 6/26/70 that on the evening of
6/14/70 the subject was observed boarding Aeroflot for a flight to Moscow.

Although a concentrated investigative effort was put forth by the New York
and Newark Offices in the investigation, it is noted that no specific directions
were given PSI Nelson by the New York or Newark Offices or the Bureau from
January, 1970, to the time subject left for Moscow in June, 1970, in spite of
the fact that Nelson and the subject had mutual professional backgrounds (chemists)
and from a review of the files appeared to speak the same language.

It is noted that this case was originally opened as a PSI and
potential double agent case. It is still in a pending status and
is still being reported by you as a potential double agent case,
when in fact the individual (Azaryan) against whom Nelson was directed
departed the U.S. in June, 1970.

A review of the Nelson file fails to contain any instructions or
directions regarding the development of Nelson as a double agent and
in addition a review of the Azaryan, file similarly contains no infor-
mation or instructions from the Bureau in this regard. There appears
to be a definite weakness in the overall administration and supervision
of this "potential double agent" at the Seat of Government.

You are requested to advise the following:

1. What is your overall supervisory policy in connection with
developing potential security informants directed against a double
agent?

2. Why you continue to, carry this. case (Nelson) in a pending
, status when the subject whom he was directed against (Azaryan) left
“the U.S. for Russia in June, 1970.

3. Why you failed to instruct and aggressively direct the
office of origin in the Nelson case against the double agent target
Azaryan. :

4, Why you have the Nelson case listed as a potential double
agent when in effect he was being developed as a PSI.

Explanations Requested:

1. Case supervisor and Unit Chief ‘Bowen F. Rose for
failure to detect the above delinquencies in your overatt supervision
of the Nelson matter.

2, Comments of Section Chief William A. Branigan,

The case of Eric |Nelson, PSI, IS-R,
was assigned to me on 12/17/70,
therefore, I was not responsible

for instruction or direction of the
office of origin in this matter

prior to that date and it has not come up for review on tickler
as yet. With regard to the case of Vladimir G,Azaryan, IS-R,
this case is closed and has never been assigned to me,

With regard to questions raised by the Inspector,
the following is set out.

It is presumed question one relates to our super-
visory policy with regard to the development of informants
to be targeted against Soviet officials and/or Soviet agents,
not against our double agents, It is our policy to encourage
informant development of as many individuals as possible
against a Soviet target to provide the widest spectrum of
information concerning his social, business and personal life
in order to develop data essential for in depth defection
analysis, In addition, we seek toa identify those individuals
whom the Soviets appear to be selecting for recruitment and
to develop them to act in our behalf against the Soviets.
Such highly controlled actions serve either to involve the
Soviets in time consuming and costly operations in which they
can only receive carefully selected and screened information
or disinformation or may provide us the basis for effective
counterintelligence actions against the Soviets, as is so
well illustrated in the_Azaryan case, Our supervision in
the development of informants is accomplished through the
close review and analysis of the periodic progress letters
submitted on Soviet officials; the direction which we afford
to contact cases and to the cases resulting from the DESECO
Program,

ect As the result of an excellent counterintelligence
effort formulated and carried out by the New York Office
with Bureau guidance and direction, a defection approach
was made to Azaryan, by NY_5179-S on, 6/4/70, This informant
had previously been handied by Yuriy K. Kitaev, another
experienced, aggressive KGB officer. As a result of this
action, both Soviets departed the U. S, almost immediately.
The loss of these two experienced operatives most certainly
caused a serious disruption in the activities of the
New York Residency of the KGB. :

AW 55151 Docld: 32989638 Page 620 1re



~5-

_ We have learned through defector Ee that in
instances such as described above, the entire activity of
the KGB officers involved as well as the Residency as a
whole are subjected to most careful scrutiny to determine
if there has been a penetration; if the operation was
mishandled and what, if anything, can be salvaged from
other operations which were being run by the officers
involved, Such a review may take many months. No doubt
Azaryan's contacts with Nelson, have been the subject of
such careful study. Inasmuch as we did not involve Nelson
in our approach to Azaryan, there is no reason to believe
that the KGB does not still consider Nelson as a potential,
agent. :

It would be logical for the Soviets to have
Nelson's development continued by Azaryan's replacement,
who would by now have been in the U. S. for a relatively
short period of time, Historically, a newly arrived KGB
operative takes some months to get acclimated to the

environm in whi he i work and, therefore, does

environment in which he +

not jump right in to take over a net of agents.

The Nelson, case has been maintained in a pending
status as it was felt he still possesses potential as a
source against the Soviets. At this point the only ones
who know if this is true are the KGB, If we were to
attempt to initiate contact between Nelson and the Soviets,
-they would be convinced he is a plant and lose ail interest
in him. The only course of action we can pursue at this
time is to wait for the Soviets to make a move.

: Newark's most recent communication in this
matter advised that Nelson is alert to our interests and
they are maintaining Contact with him. This is essential
to insure we have full knowledge and control of any future
Soviet initiatives. Experience has shown the Soviets will

. allow situations such as this to remain dormant for as
long as eight years, It is not suggested that this matter
will be kept pending for this length of time; however,
for reasons indicated it is incumbent upon us to continue
to follow this matter for a reasonable period of time.

A review of the Azaryan file will show aggressive
supervision by Seat of Government supervisors, including
specific instructions to the field. As a prime defection

target, all facets of the investigation of his activities
were carefully considered. ,NY_5179-S_ was selected as the
vehicle to carry out our defection approach. Nelson, a
contact of Azaryan, was interviewed and was cooperative.
His operation as a source against Azaryan was proceeding

in proper fashion, and having decided on the utilization

of NY5179:S..to make the approach to Azaryan, there was

no need to expedite_Nelson's development, By not involving
Nelson in this operation we have not unnecessarily revealed
“our interests in him and preserved a potential asset.

With regard to question four, the designations of

an individual as a Potential Security Informant and as a
potential double agent are not mutually exclusive. Potential
Security Informant is the term defined in the Manual of
Instructions for an individual in position to become active
in intelligence activities and administrative supervision is
in accord with provisions of the Manual of Instructions.

On the other hand, potential double agent is merely an
arbitrary designation we apply to an individual who is in
contact with a Soviet-bloc official, but in which the
relationship has not yet developed into one of 4 vovert
intelligence nature, Such a relationship is well
illustrated in Azgaryan's overt business contacts with

Nelson on behalf of Amtorg, the Soviet trading COMPANY ¢

That such a relationship may ABFUptly Change ih character

to a covert intelligence operation is well documented in
countless cases which have arisen out of “innocent” business
oriented contacts. For this reason the arbitrary designation
‘of potential double agent was given to Nelson,

In connection with the observation that the Bureau
.instructed the Newark Office to interview,Nelson, and furnish
results in a form suitable for dissemination the Newark
Office furnished background information and advised
information would be furnished in LHM form under the Azgaryan,
caption, The only occasion when substantive data received
from a source appears in the informant case file is in the
semiannual justification letter in abbreviated form, See |
Section 107K, paragraph 7, page 13, Manual of Instructions,
which states:

“Correspondence in security informant and
i potential informant matters should be

. strictly limited to administrative handling
of informant and should not contain
information more properly furnished under
substantive case caption.”
