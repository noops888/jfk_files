HERRERA ANGELES, Secretary of Internal Affairs of the School-
teachers Union, and three others had, on the previous day, sent
to the National Congress of the Communist Party of Mexico their
resignations as members of this Party. They gave as their reasons
that the Communist Party of Mexico had not been properly organized,
former vices had not been corrected, and they were not in accord
with its policy regarding international affairs.

The Mexico City daily, "La Prensa," dated May 18, 194k,
earried an article reportedly based on information furnished by
some members of the Schoolteachers Union regarding the Communist
Group within this union. This stated that at a secret session

“of the Communist teachers, some were awarded the Dionisio Encina
"medal" as prizes. Among those listed by the artifle as receiving
this medal were MANUEL HERRERA ANGELES and RODOLFOAENGISO.« Mey

of a Dionisio Encina "medal," other than in the article mentioned
