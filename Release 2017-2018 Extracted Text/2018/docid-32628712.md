After briefings on the military and political situation

simllar fasts lorce there.

veloped that the status had not been indicated in the messages

en thatsto 14 cho 20

and I was asked to prepare a brief statement of the points

thst needed to be made for inclusion in a subsequent message.

In connection with the reference to NSC discussion of the

Aotion Memorandun, Mir. Gottrell asked that agencies make known

at the Wednesday meeting of the Task Force any views they pian

(I subaequently euphasized to

Mr. Cottrell the fact that this Memorandum was being scheduled

on the agenda for information and that it was intended that

the Memorandun

should stand and that there would be no dis-

cussion of it in the NSC unless an agency had a serious point

that it wished to argue in front of the Fresident.

SEGBET

Mr. Cottrell referred to the fact that it was planned to

add an additional individual to the Public Relations Staff of

the Far Bast Bureau tolhandle pubiic relations on Viet Nam;

that is, to put out information on south viet lam and to be

available to answer questions

In responae to a question,

Mr. Cottroll indicated that there would be no connection be

tween this public relations man and the task force.

Mr. Cottrell also noted that this Task Force would be running

the Viet Nan desk, although the forner Assistant Desk Officer

would now be naned the Desk Officer and would handle routine

matters.

Mr. Cottrell asked me whether the planned weekly

status report should not be so timed that it could be

scheduled on a Friday NSC agenda. He also noted that a

separate status report ould be propared on covert activities

and transmitted to the NSC. I pointed out that there was no

established meeting time for the NSC and that, therefore, it

would be difficult to relate work on the report to lse

meetings.

I indioated that I would check on the matter of

scheduling such reports on isc agendas.

(This natter sub-

sequently taken up with you and with fr. Bundy.)

A question was raised as to whether portions of the Task

Force report could be downgraded or de-classified.

I pointed

out that me ordinarily proceeded, in handling list documents.

having primary respoasibility

should make determination as to the classification of a

particular item in an NSC document and had the authority to

doingrade or de-classify as necessary in the course of in

plementation.

Reference was made to the fact that a meeting was

scheduled in the White House on Thursday (under Hr. Dutton's

leadership) to discuas the fate of Project Hope".

Although

this hospital ship la supposed to be a private enterprise,

the

Government (ICA) has been picking up the tab for some time.

It is said to have considerable publio relations value, but

there is considerable doubt as to unether it makos econonio

sense - it costa $5,000 a day to operate the ship.

It was

the consensus of the meeting that, in view of the

preparations

that had been made to receive the

ship in Saigon, it would

not be desirable to

cancel the stop in Saigon, although, if

necessary, it could be kept short.
