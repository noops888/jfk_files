MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
SUBJECT: Yuriy I, NOSENKO

1. The attached memorandum describes the techniques
used and the results obtained in the first phase of the
present interrogation of NOSENKO. The most significant
item to.emerge from this questioning and related polygraph
testing. pertained to Subject's story on Lee Harvey OSWALD,
Subject's reactions to the polygraph indicate that he
never heard of OSWALD util after President Kennedy's
assassination in-Noverber 1963, that he was not an active
participant in the case as claimed and that his whole
sto on: OSWALD was prepared by the KGB and given to us
at their direction.

2. Other areas of strong reaction refer to Subject's
suspected. contact with the KGB while in Geneva in 1962 and
1964:.and:'‘to Abidian and the Pushkin Street drop (key factor
in the PENKOVSKIY compromise).. Subject became very upset
at. questioning: on’ this: subject and refused to-discuss his
‘own alleged involvement in the case. We also touched upon .
NOSENKO's ‘parental background, periods of imprisonment and
homosexuality. His reactions here all pointed to clear-
cut contradictions in the story he has told us.

3... There still remain several areas of interest and
importance to be covered with the techniques used to date.
We expect.to complete this line of questioning by 28 October.

4. ‘This first phase has enabled us to confirm our
analyses of key aspects of this case. More important is
the fact that NOSENKO knows he is reacting in sensitive
areas and this is worrying him because he is not sure how
much we know or how we learned it. NOSENKO's reactions
have given-us hope that we may by this procedure have begun
to strike home. We do not know what it is that keeps this
man sitting month after month in his present situation.

We speculate’that one factor may be confidence that the
KGB will get him out, Related to this may be the thought
that the KGB has CIA so deeply penetrated that it would be
unhealthy for him to confess. Our current line of interro-
gation, expanded and used even more forcefully, might

break down some of his obstacles to confession by showing

us in a different and stronger posture. Therefore, we now
plan to go beyond the limited aims originally set for this
phase of the interrogation. We plan to continue the inter-
rogation in the hope of getting a confession; written plans
will be submitted when they are more definitely formulated.

24 October 1966

1. This is an interim report on progress to date in
the new phase in the interrogation of NOSENKO, which began
on 18 October 1966, and covers the first four days, 18-21
October. After a break, it will resume on 25 October.

2. Gur aims in this phase of the interrogation have
been limiteds in view of the possibility of losing access
to NOSENKO, wa have sought (a) to strengthen our basic. report,
now in preparation, by testing his story further, clarifying

- points of.confusion and revealing new contradictions, and

by. polygraph examinations of key areas, and (b) to lead
toward his eventual confession by directly exploiting our
hypotheses about the true background of NOSENKO and this
KGB operation, to convey to NOSENKO the impression that we
know. more than. before, that we possess irrefutable. proof

of his guilt and that he has no prospects for release. We
refrained from doing this in earlier phases of the interro-
gation, but at this point there seems little to lose.

3. The first four days have shown that the method is
useful... .NOSENKO again proved.a.good reactor on polygraph,
‘he seemed aisturbes by. our knowledge and the special areas
of interest. we revealed, and we were able to develop im-
portant new information, contradictions and indications
concerning the’ background of this operation.

Method

4. Our basic approach has been to question NOSENKO in
specific terms on selected and detailed aspects of the story
he-has.told to date. We gave him no explanation for our
renewal ofthe interrogation, nor has he asked for any. Our
questions have been pointed and detailed and neither require
nor. ‘permit long-winded answers; they do not seek new infor-
mation but. are clearly designed to check information he pro-
vided earlier; our questions are slanted to build up the
impression that they are based on data we have learned in-
dependently. The subject matter is taken up in a predeter-
mined order designed for maximum impact on NOSENKO. Inter~
rogation sessions are followed by polygraph examinations on
the matters covered in the interrogation and/or other topics.
Somewhat more time is spent on direct polygraph examination
than on interrogation.

Highlights to Date

5. OSWALD Case: The opening session was a polygraph
examination: conducted by Nicholas Stoiaken, whom NOSENKO
recognized’ as his earlier polygraph operator. The question~
ing was devoted entirely to Lee Harvey OSWALD and NOSENKO's
role in the OSWALD case. We hit this point before any other
in order (a), to permit clean polygraph testing on this key
matter without having disturbed him with other questions,
and. (b), to get over to NOSENKO the gravity of our concern
on this matter of highest state interest. The operator's
conclusions weres

a. Subject was not personally or actually in-
volved in the OSWALD case from 1959 while OSWALD was
in the Soviet Union,

b. Subject received special instructions (from
the KGB) about the OSWALD case and what to tell am-
erican authorities about it.

ce.  Subject's alleged association with the OSWALD
case both “before and after” the Kennedy assassination
was partly for the purpose of supporting and sub-
stantiating Subject’s cover story “legend”.

a. Subject heard of OSWALD (as a case) only after
Kennedy's assassination, however he was not an active
participant in 1963 as he indicates, but was probably
briefed on the case by a KGB officer.

6. Geneva Meetings: We devoted several hours of inter-
rogation and polygraph testing to the Geneva periods, June
1962 and January-February 1964. We hit this point second in
order because there are clear signs of. important deception
behind it and it offers us special opportunities to suggest
inside information which in fact derive from observation and
deduction. among the high points were the following:

a. Pavel SHAKHOVs NOSENKO's story of his “investi-
gation” of SHAKHOV, a Soviet delegation member whom he
said was suspected in 1962 to be an American agent, was
covered again in detail. The new data we obtained tend
to.confirm that this is a serious part of NOSENKO's

message. SHAKHOV's background in fact. suggests that
he is sony, 2 XSF officers his contact in Geneva

at the center of “of NOSENKO'S “storys” —We-sianted our
questions to suggest knowledge that SHAKHOV is a KGB
Gtticer {not a KGB investigation suspect) and that
we may know of some of his important operational
contacts. NOSENKO was inconsistent in his story
and reacted significantly under polygraph examina-
tion. We are currently tracing new names and data
and are re-examining the significance of this matter.

be iB rol Geneva; NOSENKO reacted very
strongly and consistently to the question of whether
or not he had been sent to Geneva by the KGB to con-
tact CIA, whether he was receiving KGB direction
there, and on related questions, including some re-
lated to his ostensible investigation of Pavel SHAKHOV.

ce U.S, Personnel and Installations in Geneya:
NOSENKO was interrogated on his earlier story that
hhe “had seen in Geneva in 1964 the file on KGB activity
against American installations in Geneva (KGB cryptonym
*SKORPION"). His version this time conflicted with
his 1964 version but contained the same message, that
the weak and understaffed KGB in Geneva had little
interest, limited facilities and no success in opera~
tions against the Americans and had practically no
idea of the identities of CIA personnel there. In
addition, NOSENKO reacted to polygraph questions
related to whether the KGB had told him the name of
his CIA case officers, On the other hand, he did not
react to the names of the then COS Switzerland and
COB Geneva, which suggests that he was not told them
(these names were buried in lists of names).

d. KGS Personnel_in Genevas NOSENKO's answers
to questions concerning Alexandr KISLOV conflicted
with certain details earlier reported, including KIS-
Lov's role in the AECHITCHAT case. He seemed disturbed
by the questioning on KISLOV and finally said he saw
mo reason to answer any more of them. However, his
polygraph reactions did not suggest that he was as
sensitive to KISLOV as to other individuals and matters
covered in the same series of questions. We also asked,
with the polygraph, whether he was withholding anything

l ___jat the time.” He had earlier
Baid that his daily access to the KGB Residency in
Geneva in 1964 was due to his frequent contacts with
Mikhail S...TSYMBAL? this time he said that he only
saw TSYMBAL twice in’Geneva in 1964 and failed to
mention a: Sunday meeting with TSYMBAL which he had
reported to us at the time it occurred. This leaves
open the whole question of how NOSENKO can explain
his daily access to the Residency, which he himself
now says =~ evidently on the basis of what he has
learned from our previous interrogations — is not
normally permitted. This will be covered in

questioning.
7.Matters Related to the PENKOVSKTY Compromises

a... John ABIDIAN's. Visit to the Pushkin Street
Deaddrop: NOSENKO. reacted with special sensitivity
and intensity when asked in a polygraph test whether
he had been instructed to tell CIA about ABIDIAN's
visit to the Pushkin. Street deaddrop. In addition,
he.refused for the first time to discuss his own
perticipation in the incident, adamantly claiming
that he does not remember when or even whether he
visited the drop or whether he read reports on
surveillance coverage of it after ABIDIAN's visit.
(He had earlier said he visited the drop at least
twice, immediately after ABIDIAN's visit: he des—
eribed.the location and named the KGB officers he
went with.). In sharp contrast to his reluctance
to discuss his personal role was his unhesitating
and confident response to other aspects of the
Pushkin Street drop story: he reiterates that
ASIDIAN was under full time, double-strength sur-
veillance throughout his tour in Moscow and that
ABIDIAN was surveilled to the drop. He now adds,
for. the first time, that the KGB concluded that the
drop had been initially found by a U.S, tourist or
@elegation member and that ABIDIAN was merely check-
ing out dts suitability for some eventual use. (In
fact, PENKOVSKIY proposed the drop and ABIDIAN went
there only in response to the agreed telephonic
signal triggered by persons unknown, not by PENKOV—

SKTY.)

Ce VORONTSOV: It had been speculated

that when NOSENKO mentioned in June 1962 meetings
the name of his “big friend” in the naval GRU,
Admiral he may have been fishing for
comments from us concerning Marshal VARENTSOV,
PENKOVSKIY's protector. Queried this time about

he seems to have completely forgotten ever having
claimed. a personal relationship.

tion of whethe wad actually recruited by the KGB,

so far are ‘the followings

ase Identity: NOSENKO. was questioned extensively
on the polygraph concerning his identity. In one
series of tests, for example, he was asked whether
Minister of Shipbuilding Ivan NOSENKO was the father
of Yuri Ivanovich NOSENKO and was then asked whether
Minister NOSENKO was his father; similarly with
Tamara NOSENKO, his ostensible mother. NOSENKO did
not» react to.the question phrased "Yuri Ivanovich
NOSENKO", but reacted consistently when asked if
these were his own parents. He was sensitive to
questions concerning his marriage. (There is reason
to believe he is not, in fact, married.) He was also
given a series of tests asking for the first letter
of his given name. The whole alphabet was covered,
andthe polygraph charts ‘show that he became increas-
ingly tense, culminating at the letter S (or perhaps
T) on both runs. While we recognize that testing of
this sort may not give valid results, it certainly
gets over to NOSENKO the degree of our doubt and may
even help us determine who he really is. We will
pursue this further, covering his patronym and family
nameas well.

isonment: In view of the strong indica
tions that NOSENKO has spent considerable time in
prison (as reported in the past), we questioned him
on this, He reacted strongly and consistently to the
question of whether he had been imprisoned in the USSR.
We then ran a series of tests to determine his relative
sensitivity to various types of imprisonment, various
crimes for which he may have been imprisoned, various
areas of the USSR where he may have been imprisoned,

and various years of imprisonment. He seemed con-
sistently sensitive to correctional labor camps

as the type of prison, and to several possible
causes of imprisonment: particularly homosexuality,
desertion and felony. Interestingly enough he was
not sensitive to questions concerning imprisonment
for self-inflicted wounds despite his story that he
had shot himself in the hand during the war. He
seemed more consistently sensitive to Siberia as
the area of imprisonment but the results were not

as clear as on other aspects of his story. He seems
particularly sensitive to the years 1954-1956, which
immediately preceed the period from 1956 onward,
when he began to appear in KGB operations.

SUBJECT: Polygraph Examination. of Yuri Ivanovich NOSENKO
Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD on 18 October. 1966

Bat und 3

Subject of this report is a thirty-eight year old married
male who, on 4 February 1964, established contact with United
eaee authorities in Geneva, Switzerland and asked for political
asylum. - e

Subject .was initially polygraphed on 4 April 1964 at a
covert security location in washington, D.C. suburbs (see
IRD. Report. #67491, dated 8 April 1964). ‘The purpose of the
1964 polygraph interview was to establish whether Subject was
@ bona fide defector, or if he was a dispatched Soviet agent
sent’ by Soviet Intelligence on a specific mission. The con-
clusion arrived at during the 1964 polygraph testing was that
Subject was attempting deception; that he was not a bona fide
defector,..but a dispatched Soviet agent.

During the interim, April 1964. - October 1966, Subject
has. undergone additional interrogaticn during which an attempt
was made to obtain the truth from Subject, and to clarify the
many inconsistencies and discrepancies which were evident
throughout Subject's version of his personal and professional

history. Subject admitted to lying and falsifying
about some phases of his background only after long and tedius
interrogation and after confrontation with irrefutable facts
which Subject could not argue against. Subject has admitted
to exaggerating his own personal participation, his KGB rank,
and certain areas of his personal background. He has not,
however, admitted deception concerning two main elements of
his KGB operational history, even when confronted by logical
and factual contradiction in his story.

The specific purpose of the 18 October 1966 polygraph
test was toz

a. Attempt to establish whether Subject was in
fact actually involved in the OSWALD case while OSWALD
was in the Soviet Union, or if his association with the
OSWALD case was only part of his cover story legend.

TOP SEERET
EVES OILY



13-00000

b. Determine if Subject was personally active
in the OSWALD case in 1963 after President Kennedy's
assassination.

c. Ascertain if Subject received special instruc-
tions from the KGB to pass on to the American Government
regarding the OSWALD case.

Procedure:

The undersigned polygraphed Subject at a covert security
location on 18 October 1966 between the hours of 1305 and 1810.
The testing was.conducted in the Russian language. The specific
area covered during the 18 October polygraph interview dealt
with questions concerning the Lee Harvey OSWALD case and Sub-
ject's knowledge and association with the OSWALD case in the
Soviet Union. The series of questions asked of Subject about
the OSWALD case was based entirely on the information Subject
gave regarding OSWALD.

Subject immediately recognized the undersigned es the
polygraph officer who had administered the previous polygraph
test, and recalled the specific date of the test, 4 April 1964.
Subject was told that he would again participate in another
polygraph interview. Subject*s polygraph patterns revealed a
certain amount of muscular movement during some of the phases
of testing, ‘however, not withstanding this evidence it is the
opinion of the undersigned that there are polygraphic indica-
tions of attempted deception by the Subject to some of the
specific quéstions asked of him (see conclusion). ‘hen Subject
was challenged and accused of deception, he would repeat that
he-'‘was. telling only the truth now, ané was telling the truth
during his°last polygraph test. «hen he was confronted with
the fact: that, he had lied to specific questions Sauring his.
1964 polygraph, ‘and’ that these lies were subsequently con-
clusively proven to be lies, when he himself later (isesci966)
admitted that ha had fabricated about portions of his back~
ground story, he admitted that this was so, but that the lies
were minor and regarding personal areas of his background only.
Re justified. his past deception.on the ground that he did so
only.to embelish his personal background to improve his image
in our eyes..

Discussion which tock place during the polygraph testing

and Subject's additions to and revisions of his previous
statements are incorporated in the SB report.

In analyzing Subject's polygraph charts, polygraphic
evidence or indication of deception was considered. from the
standpoint of consistency and significance (strength) of the
reaction...

Reactions found. to. exist.on norm or unimportant lead-in
questions, especially if these reactions are inconsistent, are
not noted as such in this report. There is no logical explan-
ation for Subject's sensitivity to this catagory of questions
other than ‘the possibility that some of these questions may
be more meaningful. to Subject. than we are at present aware,
or that’ Subject is ecquainted with the polygraph technique
and 4s attempting to create false, controlled reactions to
lead-in’ and harmless seeations in an attempt to mislead poly-
graph analysis.

However, Subject's reactions to important questions when
noted as.-"reaction" are, “in the opinion of the undersigned,
definite indications of deception.

On the basis of an. analysis of the polygraph charts obtained
during: Subject's. polygraph interrogation and testing during the

as Subject was not personally or actually
involved inthe OSWALD case from 1959 to 1961 while
OSWALD’ wasin the Soviet Union.

b.. Subject heard of OSWALD only after Kennedy's
assassination, howsver he wag not an active partici-
pant in 1963 as he indicates, but was probably briefed
on the case by a KGB officer.

¢. Subject received special instructions (from

KGB) about the OSWALD case and what to tall American
authorities about it.
