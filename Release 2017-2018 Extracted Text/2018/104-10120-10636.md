MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

SUBJECT

• StUkols, Frank Anthony

AKA:

FIORINI, FranK

SF#353 459

1. As you are aware, Frank Anthony STURGiS, one of the

convicted Watergate burglars, has repeatedly and talsely claimed

affiliation with this

Agency,

Attached to instant memorandum

are copies of two articles from the New York Daily News by Paul

MESKIC, dated circa

• April 1975 and 13 June 1976, specifying.

that one Marie LORENZ was

involved with Frank STURGIS and Alex

RORKE in 1959/1960 in anti-CASTRO activities. Furthermore, the

articles again

allege that STURGIS and RORKE were acting on

behalf of this Agency.

The 13 June 1976 article further alleges

Marie LORENZ has claimed that

at the direction of STURGIS and

(and the Agency and the FBI) in 1960 she went to Cuba to

poison CASTRO.

The poison was given to her by STURGIS. In the

first

article Marie LORENZ alleges that E. Howard HUNT, known

to her as "Eduardo" was the paymaster for STURGIS and RORKE.

HUNT has publicly claimed not knowing STURGIS until at least

the late 1960's.

Alex RORKE, i identical with Alexander I. RORKE, JT:

(SF#427 955), Was

free-lance writer, photographer, and soldier

of fortune who disappeared in September 1963 while flying in

Central America. There is no evidence in this file that RORKE

was ever, affiliated with this Agency.

There is evidence that

RORKE was involved with STURGIS in anti-CASTRO activities in

the early 1960's.

3. Relative to Marie LORENZ, Initial Office of Security

traces in this

name were negative in April 1975.

Additional

research

relative to

the June 1976 article has revealed a

positive identification.

Composite

information from the attach-

ments would suggest that Marie LORENZ is of German father/

American mother birth, born circa 1940; that her father was

Heinrich LORENZ, a former German Navy Captain who in February

was the captain of a luxury liner "Berlin"; and that in

1959/1960 she was living with her brother at 344 West 84th

In March 7960 Marie LORENZ was in

contact in New York with Jesus YANEZ Pelletier of the CASTRO

regime.

Office of Security traces in the name of Heinrich

LORENZ revealed that he is the father of Valerie Claire

LORENZ

(SF#117 245). Information in the file, coupled with informa-

tion in the attached articles, positively identities

younger sister oi Valerie Claire LORENZ, one Ilona Marita

LORENZ, as being identical with the Marie LORENZ mentioned in

these articles.

5. Valerie Claire LORENZ (SF#117 245), born on 9 October

1936 at Bremerhaven, Germany, was the subject of a Covert

Security Clearance

request in March 1955 by the Monetary Branch

Division.

Valerie Claire LORENZ had graduated from

Roosevelt High School,

Washington, D. C., in June 1954.

..As of

March 1955 she

was employed as a secretaiy to F. P. HARMAN, Jr.

(SF#67 493) ,

vice-president of the National Bank of Washington,

14th and "G"

Streets, N. W., Washington, D. C., and as such

would have access to

sensitive financial transactions being

administered by the Monetary Branch through HARMAN.

Covert Security Clearance was granted in July 1955 and canceled

because of her resignation on 21 August 1959. There is no

subsequent activity in the file.

As of 1943 at 18310 Ferguson Street,

NOTE: During the 1955 background inves-

tigation of Valerie Claire LORENZ, an

informant advised that the LORENZ

tamily was somehow related to general

Haydon BOATNER.

Major General Haydon

Lemaire BOATNER, retired, is, the

father of Helene Lemarie BOATNER

(SF#253 375). telene Lemarie BOATNER

is a current staff employee, GS-16,

Office of the Comptroller, DCI. This

file has been reviewed in depth and

nothing was found to show a relation-

ship between the BOATNER and LORENZ,

families.

7.

Variations of all of the names of Ilona Marita

LORENZ and her family have been checked against Office of

Security indices

with no additional results with the exception

to a reference to the file captioned "Cuban Intelligence

Activities" (SF#350 643). An FBI New York Office report

th8 43) a

in

this file dated 10 February 1960

captioned "Cuban Intelligence

Activities in the United States" reflects, in substance, that

Ilona Marita LORENZ,

344 West 87th Street,

New York City, on

22 December 1959 advised SA O'Brien, FBI,

that Jesus Yanes

PELLETIER, Cuban Revolutionary Army

and Military Aide to the

Prime Minister (CASTRO), had arrived in New York City

on 18 December 1959. LORENZ reported that she went out with

him on the night of 19 December to the La Baracca Restaurant.

She believed that PELLETIER was in New York collecting intelli

gence information for the CASTRO government.

8. Relative to LORENZ's claim in the attached

. article

that she and Alex RORKE (in conjunction with the assassination

attempt against CASTRO) visited FBI offices in New York and

had a

"conference with the two agents. who had-questioned hei

previously and a CIA official"

LORENZ was interviewed by SA O'Brien on

it is interesting to note that

22 December 1959.

The

tile of Alexander 1. RORKE, JT.,

reflects that he was inter-

viewed on 30 December 1959 by SA Francis J. O Brien, FBI, New

York.
