is a current staff employee, GS-16,
Office of the Comptroller, per. This
file has been reviewed in depth and
nothing was found to show a relation-
ship between the BOATNER and LORENZ
families.

7. Variations of all of the names of Ilona Marita
LORENZ and her family have been checked against Office of
Security indices with no additional results with the exception
to a reference to the file captioned "Cuban Intelligence
Activities" (SF#350 643). An FBI New York Office report in
this file dated 10 February 1960 captioned "Cuban Intelligence
Activities in the United States" reflects, in substance, that
Tlona Marita LORENZ, 344 West 87th Street, New York City, on
22 December 1959 advised SA O'Brien, PBL, that Jesus Yanes
P ETIER, Cuban Revolutionary Army and Military Aide to the
Cuban Prime Minister (CASTRO) , had arrived in New York City
on 18 December 1959. LORENZ reported that she went out with
him on the night of 19 December to the La Baracca Restaurant.
She believed that PELLETIER was in New York collecting intelli-
gence information for the CASTRO government.

8. Relative to LORENZ's claim in the attached article
that she and Alex RORKE (in conjunction with the assassination
attempt against CASTRO) visited FBI offices in New York and
had a "conference with the two agents who had-questioned her
previously and a CIA of al", it is interesting to note that
LORENZ was interviewed by SA O'Brien on 22 December 4959, The
file of Alexander 1. RORKE, Jr., reflects that he was inter-
viewed on 30 December 1959 py SA Francis J. O'Brien, FBI, New
York.
