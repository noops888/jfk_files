Enclosed herewith for the Bureau are two Xerox
copies each of a leaflet captioned "Special Bulletin" and
a leaflet captioned "Kennedy Assassination", One Xerox ie
copy of each is enclosed for Kansas City.

yl The two leaflets were furnished on. 3/25/64 by

LAME N who received them on that morning from
ERN i 174 Devon Street, Kearny, N.Js, described by
CREEDEN as evidently a leader of the "MINUTEMEN" in the
Newark area. CREEDEN pointed out that MOORE did not give
him the sheet concerning security measures referred to in () )
the next to last paragraph on page 2 of the "Special Nee
Bulletin", CREEDEN should be described as a source with
whom insufficient contact has been had to determine his
reliability. . : .

Inasmuch as CREEDEN stated that the check marks
on both leaflets were made by MOORE, it is suggested that
in order to avoid compromising the informant these check
marks be covered if any further copies of. these leaflets
are made for dissemination, The originals have been
returned to CREEDEN who was instructed to return them to

MOORE by the end of the week, 6
