MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

David D. Gries

Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

SUBJECT:

JFK Assassination Records;

Release of William Pawley's Name

We continue to believe that the Agency cannot justify

withholding the fact of William Pawley's relationship with CIA,

in view of the public record. I ask that you personally read the

attached brief items, which clearly reveal a relationship. Two

of the items are from official documents-one from General

Maxwell Taylor's Board of Inquiry, the other from the record of

the House Assassination Committee. The other contains quotes of

Pawley's own statements, which are

included in a book by well-

known authors.

the Talisman Sugar Corporation. In addition, he was a real estate de-

veloper and, of course, a millionaire many times over. (He was also

a man of rather extreme political views. In a publication of the arch-

conservative American Security Council, former Ambassador

Pawley once advocated unleashing Chinese Nationalist troops from

Taiwan to run the reds out of Vietnam - and then letting them go

on to an invasion of the Chinese mainland.)

In 1954 Ike formed the Doolittle Committee to forestall a con-

gressional inquiry into CIA covert actions and named Pawley one

of the four members. The panel was chaired by General Jimmy

Doolittle, like Pawley a famed World War Il aviation figure. The

Doolittle Report said the United States had to abandon its tradi

tional concepts of fair play in the face of an "implacable enemy" and

"learn to subvert, sabotage and destroy our enemies by more clever,

more sophisticated, and more effective methods than those used

against us." The American people, the report said, might have to be

acquainted with "this fundamentally repugnant philosophy."

ike bought the Doolitle Report. He issued a follow-up Nional

Security directive seeking the destruction of "international com-

munism" and authorizing "all compatible activities" to achieve that

goal. The Cuba Project was to stretch the definition of compatible.

"I had several conferences with the President," Ambassador

Pawley said, "and finally he was convinced that the anticommunist

Cubans in Florida should be armed and given every assistance to

overthrow the communist regime." This was, of course, in direct

violation of the Neutrality Act, and the Munitions Act to boot. The

old Flying Tiger made a pitch to take over command of the project

himself, his argument was the highly selective one that the CIA was

primarily an intelligence-gathering outfit and should not be simul-

taneously in charge of operations. "Eisenhower wanted ime to as-

sume overall command of the operation, with veto power over the

CIA," Pawley told the authors. "But Allen Dulles, joined by Chris-

tian Herter who was easily led, prevailed, and it became a CIA.

On Saint Patrick's Day the red hot line phone rang on Dulles's

desk. It was the President, giving him the green light and promising

were the ever-ready Rip Robertson and paramilitaries known only

as Ken and Mike. "I had an excellent radio on board;" Pawley re-

counted. "But I wanted to be in constant touch with the CIA office

in Miami or with the Coast Guard, which could rescue us if any-

thing happened."

William Pawley fumed as John Martino and Eddie Bayo stood

shamefully before him the day before the scheduled departure.

"They told me they had accepted $15,000 from Life magazine,"

Pawley said, "with which they had bought the military equipment

that they needed for the voyage and that Life was to send along a

reporter and a photographer. As far as I was concerned, that blew

the deal. I couldn't conceive of the U.S. government letting me go

ahead under those circumstances."

Dick Billings appealed to Pawley, who finally agreed to speak to

Life managing editor George P. Hunt. Hunt flew down from New

York. He promised that all film would be turned over to Pawley,

and Life would guarantee that no story would be written without

his consent. The promise was put in writing. Pawley called Senator

Eastland and informed him of Life's proposal. Eastland thought it

was all right to go ahead.*1

The Flying Tiger left on schedule with Billings and the three CIA

men on board. Three days later, only hours before the Flying Tiger

was due at the rendezvous point, Pawley took off in a Catalina PBY

flying boat chartered from the Aircraft Ferry Company of Fort

Lauderdale, which frequently rented planes to the CIA. Also on

board was British free-lance photographer Terrence Spencer, who

had been hired by Life, as well as Martino and Bayo and nine of his

commandos. The only reason Pawley had rented the plane was his

strong distrust of the Cubans, who he feared might hijack the Flying

Tiger to Cuba. "I frisked every one of those guys as they got on

board," Pawley said. "At this point I had no assurance of any kind

what type of men I was dealing with- whether they were anti-

Castro or pro-Castro." While the plane was in the air, all the pas-

sengers were locked into a center compartment.

When the Catalina arrived at the atoll, however, the Flying Tiger

wasn't there. She arrived seven hours later — the CIA navigator had

lost his bearings in the murky weather. Pawley unlocked his state-

1. After a discussion of procedural matters, it was de-

cided that all papers and documents stemming from the in-

quiry would be retained by General Maxwell Taylor. [

] Chief, Western Hemisphere Division, was des-

ignated recorder of the first meeting.

2. Mr. Dúlles, in his opening remarks, cited the docu-

ment which authorized CIA to conduct paramilitary opera-

tions. This document, NSC 5412, was described as one of the

most secret documents in the U.S. Government. Mr. Dulles

said that under this authority CIA is directed to engage in

activities such as the Cuban operation under the general

supervision of the National Security Council. General Taylor

indicated that he wanted a copy of this document to be made

available to him for his study. General Gray indicated he had a

copy and would give it to General Taylor.

activities on the Cuban problem prior to the establishment of

Division on 18 January 1960. In his remarks [

stated that in late 1958 CIA made two attempts (each

approved by the Department of State) to block Castro's

ascension to power. The first attempt was made in November

1958 when contact was established with Justo Carrillo and the

Montecristi Group. The second attempt was made on or

about the 9th of December 1958 when former Ambassador

William D. Pawley, supported by the CIA Chief of Station in

Havana, [

], and [

], ap-

proached Batista and proposed the establishment of a Junta

to whom Batista would turn over the reins of government.

] was queried by the Attorney General as to the

approximate date that the Agency concluded that Castro was

unacceptable to the U.S. politically, if not actually a Commu-

nist, and when this conclusion reached the Secretary of State

reports as early as June or July 1958 during the period that

JFK Assassination Records;

Release of William Pawley's Name

L Based on our review of JEk assassination records

we have concluded that the Agency cannot justify withholding

the fact of William Pawley's relationship with CIA..

We

request your agreement to release documents that acknowledge

the relationship.

Information that reveals sensitive

sources and methods would be protected.

2.

William Pawley was an unpaid asset of CIA in the

early 1960s, who assisted us in activities targeted against

Cuba.

It is a matter of public record that he was heavily

involved in anti-Castro activities, and that he was in

contact wih DCI Allen Dulles and other senior CIA officials.

Pawley publicly acknowledged his CIA connections.

Clair Boothe Luce told Congress that Pawley persuaded her to

help fund boats to be used in raids against cuba by anti-

Castro Cubans®

3. There are at least three books and numerous

newspaper and magazine articles that describe in detail

Pawley's contact with CIA and his involvement in covert

action against Castro. The published record of the House

Special Committee on Assassinations describes Pawley as a

supporter of the DRE (an anti-Castro organization), and a

friend of CIA Director Dulles.

4. In one book, Pawley describes his arrangement with

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records;

Release of William Pawley's Name

5.

The JFK Assassination Records Act provides that

information cannot be withheld unless disclosure would

demonstrably harm national security.

There has to be clear

and convincing evidence that disclosure would be so harmful

that it outweighs the public interest. It is not sufficient

to use the mosaic rationale, nor a general concern about the

possible effect on potential assets.

6. The numerous deletions of information and

withdrawal cards in the files on Pawley that will be

released, which comprise a full box, in themselves reveal a

covert relationship.

7.

In view of the standards established by the JFK Act

with

respect to disclosure of records, it is our judgement

that there is no justification for withholding the fact that

Pawley was a contact of, and collaborated with, CIA in anti-

Castro activities.

DC/Information Management Staff

Katherine M. Stricker, DO/IRO

Operational Status of William D. Pawley in JFK

Collection

1. BACKGROUND: William D. Pawley (201-0077378) born 1893,

millionaire, diplomat, international businessman,

adventurer was

an unpaid asset of the CIA in the early 1960's primarily targeted

against Cuba.

He had ready access to the emigre circles in

Florida, his own reasons for anti-Castro activity and a strong

streak of patriotism.

His activities on our behalf range from

conversations/consultations with Allen Dulles in his DCI's

office, to purchasing a boat with Clare Booth Luce to be used in

a sabotage raid against Cuba.

He provided operational

information to us, funded emigres who were somewhat under our

control and had the ear of high level politicians in Washington.

He was a force to be reckoned with and maintained a high profile

e seckoned with and

throughout his activities, including bragging/alluding to his

connection with the CIA.

The details of his cooperation with us

have never been acknowledged and, repeatedly since his death, we

have continued to conceal the fact of our relationship with him.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Director

Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM:

John F. Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group/CSI

SUBJECT:

JFK Record/Appeal by DO of HRG Decision/

William Pawley

Attached is a memorandum approved by the DDO which

appeals HRG's decision to release information in the JFK

records related to William Pawley's association with CIA.

2.

We make the following points to support HRG'S

position:

a.

William Pawley was a well-known, wealthy

businessman and former ambassador who was openly anti-

Castro. He publicly acknowledged his CIA connections.

He is described in press items and the

Congressional record as a friend of DCI Allen Dulles.

He openly sponsored raids by anti-Castro Cubans into

cuba.

C.

Former Ambassador Claire Booth Luce told

Congress that Pawley persuaded her to help fund boats

to be used in raids against Cuba by anti-Castro Cubans.

d. In the book, Conspiracy by Anthony Summers and

in other literature, there are descriptions of a well-

publicized joint operation by CIA and Pawley to capture

two Russian military officers from a Cuban missile site

in 1963.

• It is also noted that Pawley had a hand in

the CIA operation in Guatemala in 1954.

e. In the book, Bay of Pigs by Peter Wyden, it is

stated that J.

C. King, Chief DO/WI had plotted with

Pawley in 1958 to head off Castro's coming to power.

The book discusses Pawley's talks with

President Eisenhower which focused on Pawley's

attempt to be named to command a project to

overthrow Castro.

• Pawley is described as having undertaken

missions to Cuba and to the Dominican Republic at

CIA's

request.

Pawley is noted as having discussions with

DDCI General Carter about getting CIA assistance

for an anti-Castro operation.

Pawley is quoted as

saying he wanted to be in constant touch with the

CIA station in Miami during the operation.

f. There are numerous other references in open

sources to Pawley's contacts with Allen Dulles,

J. C. King, and CIA in general.

The record shows his family was aware of his

involvement with CIA.

h. Pawley is dead.

3.

Conclusion:

Pawley was a prominent, wealthy

American, publicly known for involvement in anti-Castro

activities and as a contact of the CIA.

We do not

believe disclosure of his relationship with the Agency

would demonstrably damage the National security of the

United States.

Operational Status of William D. Pawley in JFK

Collection

1. BACKGROUND: William D. Pawley (201-0077378) born 1893,

millionaire, diplomat, international businessman, adventurer was

an unpaid asset of the CIA in the early 1960's primarily targeted

against Cuba. He had ready access to the emigre circles in

Florida, his own reasons for anti-Castro, activity and a strong

streak of patriotism.. His activities on our behalf range from

conversations/consultations with Allen Dulles in his DCI's

office, to purchasing a boat with Clare Booth Luce to be used in

a sabotage raid against Cuba. He provided operational

information to us, funded emigres who were somewhat under our

control and had the ear of high level politicians in Washington.

He was a force to be reckoned with and maintained a high profile

throughout his activities, including bragging/alluding to his

connection with the CIA.

The details of his cooperation with us

have never been acknowledged and, repeatedly since his death, we

have continued to conceal the fact of our relationship with him.

2. ISSUE: Files on Pawley which fill one archive-sized

box are

within the JFK Collection being considered for release to

the National Archives under the JEK Act of 1992.

a. The initial review by the Historical Review Group

(HRG) recommends release of virtually all of the contents of the

box (less some cryptonyms and names of covert officers) in light

of the semi-overt nature of Pawley's relationship to the Agency

and the common perception that he was a CIA agent.

NOTES

Summary: William D. Pawley, prominent and wealthy ex-govt

official (high) financed a mission of anti-Castro Cubans who

wished to exfiltrate 4 Soviet missile officers from Cuba in

June 1963.

He bankrolled it, sailed the Cubans out in his

yacht (Flying Tiger II), and

CIA provided weapons, air support,

and naval support. The Cubans landed on the island and never

returned.

CIA after action assessment:

"OP participants had no Soviet

contacts but they parlayed notional Sov contacts into sharp con

game designed to attract Angel (Pawley etc) who could

facilitate their exit from US as well as give them some arms

equipment."

Apparently this whole episode has been kept rather quiet, and

in the past the DO has denied any relationship with Pawley.

A sanitized version of the Ops report was prepared for House

staffers to read, but they were not allowed to take notes or

possess a copy.

Also, a check of Sylvia Meagher's index does not reveal the

names of any of the Cubans denied.

For these reasons, with the additional fact that the episode

has no direct bearing on the JFK assassination, I recommend

that we deny in toto the folder, and protect the names of the

parties

involved.
