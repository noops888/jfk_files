MEMORANDUM FOR: . Deputy Director for Operations

FROM: David D. Gries
Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records;
Release of William Pawley's Name

Lor

We continue to believe that the Agency cannot justify
withholding the fact of William Pawley's relationship with CIA,
in view of the public record. I ask that you personally read the
attached brief items, which clearly reveal a relationship. Two
of the items are from official documents--one from General
Maxwell Taylor's Board of Inquiry, the other from the record of
the House Assassination Committee. The other contains quotes of
Pawley's own statements, which are included in a book by well-

known authors.

“Government until the end of 1966,(45) the group’s activities, like:

those of other anti-Castro organizations, declined iti intensity and
effectiveness. ce pees
(297) Because the DRE was an extremely militant “action” group,.
the committee was especially interested in DRE operations prior
to the assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 103.
(298) As noted, one of the effects of the Bianquita raid in September
1962, was to garner the DRE a blast of national publicity, which, in
turn, gave the leaders of the group the opportunity to solicit additional
funding from wealthy individuals who were sympathetic to their anti-
Castro cause.(46) Among those who wound up supporting the DRE
was Miami multimillionaire: William Pawley, a staunch rightwing
conservative. former owner of the Havana bus system, and a friend
of former CIA Director Allen Dulles.(47) Another supporter of the
DRE was a friend of Pawley’s, former Ambassador to Italy Clare
Roothe Ince,(48) then the wife of Time-Life publishing boss Henry
Luce, and Jater, a Nixon appointee to the Foreign Intell; ‘¢ Advisory
Hoard.
(299) In its review of DRE activities, the committee took special
interest in a relatively recent series of events involving Clare Boothe
Luce. In October 1975, Luce was being interviewed by Vera Glaser,
a reporter and columnist. for Knight. newspapers. when she told Glaser
of an alleged incident involving members of the DRE and Lee Harvey
Oswald.(49) At the time, Senator Richard Schweiker and Senator
Gary Tlart were in the midst. of their subcommittee investigation of
the Kennedy assassination as part of the Senate select committee
inquiry into intelligence activity.

500)" According to Glaser’s report of the interview. this is basically
what. Luce told her:

(301) Luce said that after the failure of the Bay of P:
her friend, William Pawley, persuaded her to help sponsor a flect of
motorhoats for a group of anti-Castro Cubans who. Pawley envisioned.
wonld be Cuban “Flying Tigers.” flying in and out of Cuba on intelli-
gence-gathering missions. Pawley had helped start. Gen. Claire Chen-
nault’s original Flying Tigers in World War TT. Tatce said she. agreed
to sponsor one boat. and its three-man crew. She said she met with this
Cuban boat crew about three times in New York and. in 1962, pub-
lished a stary about them in Life magazine.(40)
(502) Following the missile crisis in October 1962, Lace said that the
Kennedy administration clamped down _on exile activities against
Cuba. and the Pawley-sponsored boat. raids were discontinued, Luce
said she never saw her “young Cubans.” as she called them, again. (4/)
(208) ‘Then, on the night. of Kennedy's assassination. Lace said she
received a call from New Orleans from one of the boat crow Cubans,
Luce told Glaser she would call him Julio Fernandez. She said the
Cuban told her he called becanse he wanted to tell her about same in-
formation he had concerning the President's killer, Lee Harvey Os-
veal. (52)
(304) Tace told Glaser that, according to “Julio Fernandez.” Oswald
had approached the anti-Castro group to which Fernandez belonged
and offered his services as a potential Castro assassin. The Cubans.
however. did not trust Oswald. suspected he was really a Communist,

the Talisman Sugar Corporation. In addition, he was a realestate de_
veloper and, of course, a millionaire many times over. (He was also
aman of rather extreme political views. In a publication of the arch.
conservative American Security Council, former Ambassador
Pawley once advocated unleashing Chinese Nationalist troops from
Taiwan to run the reds out of Vietnam—and then letting them go
on to an invasion of the Chinese mainland.)

In 1954 Ike formed the Doolittle Committee to forestall a con-
gressional inquiry into CIA covert actions and named Pawley one. .
of the four members. The panel was chaired by General Ji
Doolittle, like Pawley a famed World War II aviation fi . The
Doolittle Report said the United States had to abandon its.tradi-
tional concepts of fair play in the face of an “implacable enemy” and
“learn to subvert, sabotage and destroy our enemies by more clever,
more sophisticated, and more effective methods than those used
against us.” The American people, the report said, might have to be
acquainted with “this fundamentally repugnant philosophy.”;

Ike bought the Doolittle Report. He issued a follow-up
Security directive seeking the destruction of “international com~
munism” and authorizing “all compatible activities” to-achieve that
goal. The Cuba Project was to stretch the definition of compatible.

“I had several conferences with the President,” Ambassador
Pawley said, “and finally he was convinced that the anticommunist
Cubans in Florida should be armed and given every. assistance to
overthrow the communist regime.” This was, of course, in direct
violation of the Neutrality Act, and the Munitions Act to boot. The
old Flying Tiger made a pitch to take over command of the project
himself; his argument was the highly selective one that the CIA was
primarily an intelligence-gathering outfit and should not be simul-
taneously in charge of operations. “Eisenhower wanted me to as-
sume overall command of the operation, with veto power over the
CIA,” Pawley told the authors. “But Allen Dulles, joined by Chris-
tian Herter who was easily led, prevailed, and it became a CIA .
operation.”*>

were the ever-ready Rip Robertson and paramilitaries known only
ag Ken and Mike. “I had an excellent radio on board,” Pawley re-
counted. “But I wanted to be in constant touch with the CIA office
jn Miami or with the Coast Guard, which could rescue us if any-
thing happened.”

William Pawley fumed as John Martino and Eddie Bayo stood
shamefully before him the day before the scheduled departure.
“They told me they had accepted $15,000 from Life magazine,”
Pawley said, “with which they had bought the military equipment
that they needed for the voyage and that Life was to send along a
reporter and a photographer. As far as I was concerned, that blew
the deal. I couldn’t conceive of the U.S. government letting me go
ahead under those circumstances.” ‘

Dick Billings appealed to Pawley, who finally agreed to speak to
Life managing editor George P. Hunt. Hunt flew down from New
York. He promised that all film would be turned over to Pawley,
and Life would guarantee that no story would be written without
his consent. The promise was put in writing. Pawley called Senator
Fastland and informed him of Life's proposal. Eastland thought it
was all right to go ahead.*! :

The Flying Tiger left on schedule with Billings and the three CIA
men on board. Three days later, only hours before the Flying Tiger
was due at the rendezvous point, Pawley took off in a Catalina PBY
flying boat chartered from the Aircraft Ferry Company of Fort
Lauderdale, which frequently rented planes to the CIA. Also on
board was British free-lance photographer Terrence Spencer, who
had been hired by Life, as well as Martino and Bayo and nine of his
commandos. The only reason Pawley had rented the plane was his.
strong distrust of the Cubans, who he feared might hijack the Flying
Tiger to Cuba. “I frisked every one of those guys as they got on
board,” Pawley said. “At this point I had no assurance of any kind
what type of men I was dealing with—whether they were anti-
Castro or pro-Castro.” While the plane was in the air, all the pas-
sengers were locked into a center compartment.

When the Catalina arrived at the atoll, however, the Flying Tiger
wasn’t there. She arrived seven hours later—the CIA navigator had
lost his bearings in the murky weather. Pawley unlocked his state-

First Meeting 55

1. After a discussion of procedural matters, it was de-
cided that all papers and documents stemming from the in-
quiry would be retained by General Maxwell Taylor. [

] Chief, Western Hemisphere Division, was des-
ignated recorder of the first meeting. ,

2. Mr. Diilles, in his opening remarks, cited the docu-
ment which authorized CIA to conduct paramilitary opera-
tions. This document, NSC 5412, was described as one of the
most secret documents in the U.S. Government. Mr. Dulles
said that under this authority CIA is directed to engage in
activities such as the Cuban operation under the general
supervision of the National Security Council. General Taylor
indicated that he, wanted a copy of this document to be made
available to him for his study. General Gray indicated he hada
copy and would give it to General Taylor.

3. [ ] was then asked to describe Agency
activities on the Cuban problem prior to the establishment of
the Task Force, i.e., Branch 4 of the Western Hemisphere
Division on 18 January 1960. In his remarks [ ].
stated that in late 1958 CIA made two attempts (each
approved by the Department of State) to block Castro’s
ascension to power. The first attempt was made in November
1958 when contact was established with Justo Carrillo and the
Montecristi Group. The second attempt was made on or
about the 9th of December 1958 when former Ambassador
William D. Pawley, supported by the CIA Chief of Station in
Havana, [ }, and [ ], ap-
proached Batista and proposed the establishment of a Junta
to whom Batista would turn over the reins of government.
[ ] was queried by the Attorney General as to the
approximate date that the Agency concluded that Castro was
unaccéptable to the U.S. politically, if not actually a Commu- °
nist, and when this conclusion reached the Secretary of State
and the President. [ ]commented that there were
reports as early as June or July 1958 during the period that
sailors from Guantanamo were held by Castro forces which
indicated beyond a reasonable doubt that the U.S. was up
against an individual who could not be expected to be accepta-

Special Assistant/ADDO

See attached memo dated 7 April 1993 by
which DDO noted that we do not concur in the
release of information on Pawley's relationship
with the CIA. We continue to have an obligation,
even to persons deceased, to protect sources and
methods. One possible course of action might
be for someone to contact Pawley's family
(who are apparently witting of his relationship)
and discuss with them their views on the
release of information about his relationship
with us. If they do not raise any objections,
this office would be willing to reconsider our
decision.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

FROM: David D. Gries
Director
Center for the Study of Intelligence

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records;
Release of William Pawley's Name

1. Based on our review of JFK assassination records,
we have concluded that the Agency cannot justify withholding
the fact of William Pawley's relationship with CIA. We
request your agreement to release documents that acknowledge
the relationship. Information that reveals sensitive
sources and methods would be protected.

2. William Pawley was an unpaid asset of CIA in the
early 1960s, who assisted us in activities targeted against
Cuba. It is a matter of public record that he was heavily
involved in anti-Castro activities, and that he was in
contact wih DCI Allen Dulles and other senior CIA officials.
Pawley publicly acknowledged his CIA connections.

Clair Boothe Luce told Congress that Pawley persuaded her to
help fund boats to be used in raids against Cuba by anti-
Castro Cubans.

3. There are at least three books and numerous
newspaper and magazine articles that describe in detail
Pawley's contact with CIA and his involvement in covert
action against Castro. The published record of the House
Special Committee on Assassinations describes Pawley as a
supporter of the DRE (an anti-Castro organization), and a
friend of CIA Director Dulles.

4. In one book, Pawley describes his arrangement with
the DDCI, General Carter, for obtaining assistance from CIA
to launch an operation into Cuba. He is quoted as saying he
wanted to be "in constant touch with the CIA office in
Miami." The record shows that his family was aware of his
involvement with. CIA.

SUBJECT: JFK Assassination Records;
Release of William Pawley's Name

5. The JFK Assassination Records Act provides: that
information cannot be withheld unless disclosure would
demonstrably harm national security. There has to be clear
and convincing evidence that disclosure would be so harmful
that it outweighs the public interest. It is not sufficient
to use the mosaic rationale, nor a general concern about the
possible effect on. potential assets.

6. The numerous deletions of information and
withdrawal cards in the files on Pawley that will be
released, which comprise a full box, in themselves reveal a
covert relationship.

7. %In view of the standards established by the JFK Act
with respect to disclosure of records, it is our judgement
that there is no justification for withholding the fact that
Pawley was a contact of, and collaborated with, CIA in anti-
Castro activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations
VIA: DC/Information Management Staff
FROM: Katherine M. Stricker, DO/IRO
SUBJECT: Operational Status of William D. Pawley in JFK
Collection

1. BACKGROUND: William D. Pawley (201-0077378) born 1893
millionaire, diplomat, international businessman, adventurer was
an unpaid asset of the CIA in the early 1960's primarily targeted
against Cuba. He had ready access to the emigre circles in
Florida, his own reasons for anti-Castro activity and a strong
streak of patriotism. His activities on our behalf range from
conversations/consultations with Allen Dulles in his DCI's
office, to purchasing a boat with Clare Booth Luce to be used in
a sabotage raid against Cuba. He provided operational ~
information to us, funded emigres who were somewhat under our
control and had the ear of high level politicians in Washington.
He was a force to be reckoned with and maintained a high profile
throughout his activities, including bragging/alluding to his
connection with the CIA. The details of his cooperation with us
have never been acknowledged and, repeatedly since his death, we
have continued to conceal the fact of our relationship with him.

2. ISSUE: Files on Pawley which fill one archive-sized
box are within the JFK Collection being considered for release to
the National Archives under the JFK Act of 1992.

a. The initial review by the Historical Review Group
(HRG) recommends release of virtually all of the contents of the
box (less some cryptonyms and names of covert officers) in light
of the semi~overt nature of Pawley's relationship to the Agency
and the common perception that he was a CIA agent.

SUBJECT: Operational Status of William Pawley in JFK Collection

b. The DO position is-that each document be reviewed
and those which specifically pertain to his CIA affiliation be
withheld i.e. POA requests, other clearance documents, taskings,
meetings with our officers and information which he reported.
While Pawley is now dead, his heirs and colleagues could well be
negatively affected by any disclosure of his CIA relationship. A
larger concern is the chilling effect such a revelation would
have on other assets, current and future, who would be repelled
by CIA's admission of a clandestine relationship post mortem.

3. RECOMMENDATION: Appeal the decision of the HRG's
initial review to release information on Pawley and request that
the releases involving Pawley be confined to his role as an
historical/political figure which should not reveal his Agency

affiliation. cq

SUBJECT: William Pawley/Appeal

On 23 April, Dave Gries agreed to challenge the DO's

appeal on William Pawley. To do this he asks that HRG do
the following:

1. Prepare a memo that he can send to Twetten.

-- Develop our argument in the memo, to include
the point that we are following the JFK law.

-- Combine the comments from the various books
into one paragraph.

-- Add Bill's point that the box (or boxes) will
have a lot of withdrawal cards, indicating
a relationship existed.

2. Attach to the memo other evidence if we have it

@.g., any photo of Pawley with Dulles, congressional
testimony, etc.

3. Check the PRB again to see if any acknowledgement of
Pawley's relationship was ever made.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director S
Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM: John F. Pereira
‘ Chief, Historical Review Group/CsI

SUBJECT: JFK Record/Appeal by DO of HRG Decision/
William Pawley

1. Attached is a memorandum approved by the DDO which
appeals HRG's decision to release information in the JFK
records related to William Pawley's association with CIA.

2. We make the following points to support HRG's
position:

a. William Pawley was a well-known, wealthy
businessman and former ambassador who was openly anti-
Castro. He publicly acknowledged his CIA connections.

b. He is described in press items and the
Congressional record as a friend of DCI Allen Dulles.
He openly sponsored raids by anti-Castro Cubans into
Cuba.

c. Former Ambassador Claire Booth Luce told
Congress that Pawley persuaded her to help fund boats
to be used in raids against Cuba by anti-Castro Cubans.

d. In the book, Conspiracy by Anthony Summers and
in other literature, there are descriptions of a well-
publicized joint operation by CIA and Pawley to capture
two Russian military officers from a Cuban missile site
in 1963.

e¢ It is also noted that Pawley had a hand in
the CIA operation in Guatemala in 1954.

SUBJECT: JFK Record/Appealed by DO of HRG Decision/
William Pawley

e. In the book, Bay of Pigs by Peter Wyden, it is
stated that J. C. King, Chief DO/WH had plotted with
Pawley in 1958 to head off Castro's coming to power.

e he book discusses Pawley's talks with
President Eisenhower which focused on Pawley's
attempt to be named to command a project to
overthrow Castro.

e Pawley is described as having undertaken
missions to Cuba and to the Dominican Republic at
CIA's request.

e Pawley is noted as having discussions with
DDCI General Carter about getting CIA assistance
for an anti-Castro operation. Pawley.is quoted as
saying he wanted to be in constant touch with the
CIA station in Miami during the operation.

f. There are numerous other references in open
sources to Pawley's contacts with Allen Dulles,
J. Cc. King, and CIA in general.

g. The record shows his family was aware of his
involvement with CIA.

h. Pawley is dead.

3. Conclusion: Pawley was.a prominent, wealthy
American, publicly known for involvement in anti-Castro
activities and as a contact of the CIA. We do not
believe disclosure of his relationship with the Agency
would demonstrably damage the National security of the
United States.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations ites
VIA: DC/Information Management Staff
FROM: Katherine M. Stricker, DO/IRO

SUBJECT: Operational Status of William D. Pawley in JFK
: Collection

‘

1. BACKGROUND: William D. Pawley (201-0077378) born 1893
millionaire, diplomat, international businessman, adventurer was
an unpaid asset of the CIA in the early 1960's primarily targeted
against Cuba. He had ready access to the emigre circles in
Florida, his own reasons for anti-Castro. activity and a strong
streak of patriotism.. His activities on our behalf range from
conversations/consultations with Allen Dulles in his DCI's
office, to purchasing a boat with Clare Booth Luce to be used in
a sabotage raid against Cuba. He provided operational
information to us, funded emigres who were somewhat under our
control and had the ear of high level politicians in Washington.
He was a force to be reckoned with and maintained a high profile
throughout his activities, including bragging/alluding to his
connection with the CIA. The details of his cooperation with us
have never been acknowledged and, repeatedly since his death, we
have continued to conceal the fact of our relationship with him.

_ 2. ISSUE: Files on Pawley which fill one archive-sized
box are within the JFK Collection being considered for release to
the National Archives under the JFK Act of 1992.

a. The initial review by the Historical Review Group
(HRG) recommends release of virtually all of the contents of the
box (less some cryptonyms and names of covert officers) in light
of the semi-overt nature of Pawley's relationship to the Agency
and the common perception that he was a CIA agent.

b. The DO position is that each document be reviewed
and those which specifically pertain to his CIA affiliation be
withheld i.e. POA requests, other clearance documents, taskings,
meetings with our officers and information which he reported.
While Pawley is now dead, his heirs and colleagues could well be
negatively affected by any disclosure of his CIA relationship. A
larger concern is the chilling effect such a revelation would
have on other assets, current and future, who would be repelled
by CIA's admission of a clandestine relationship post mortem.

3. RECOMMENDATION: Appeal the decision of the HRG's
initial review to release information on Pawley and request that
the releases involving Pawley be confined to his role as an
historical/political figure which should not reveal his Agency
affiliation.

NOTES

Summary: William D. Pawley, prominent and wealthy ex-govt
official (high) financed a mission of anti-Castro Cubans who
wished to exfiltrate 4 Soviet missile officers from Cuba in
June 1963. He bankrolled it, sailed the Cubans out in his
yacht (Flying Tiger II), and CIA provided weapons, air support,
and naval support. The Cubans landed on the island and never
returned.

CIA after action assessment: "OP participants had no Soviet
contacts but they parlayed notional Sov contacts into sharp con
game designed to attract Angel (Pawley etc) who could ;
facilitate their exit from US as well as give them some arms
equipment."

Apparently this whole episode has been kept rather quiet, and
in the past the DO has denied any relationship with Pawley.

A sanitized version of the Ops report was prepared for House
staffers to read, but they were not allowed to take notes or
possess a copy.

Also, a check of Sylvia Meagher's index does not reveal the
names of any of the Cubans denied.

For these reasons, with the additional fact that the episode
has no direct bearing on the JFK assassination, I recommend
that we deny in toto the folder, and protect the names of the
parties involved.
