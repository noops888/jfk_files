DRAFT

MEMORANDUN FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

VIA Deputy Director for Operations
FROM : Lawrence M. Sternfield

Acting Chief, Counterintelligence Staff
SUBJECT : Ruby-Oswald Conspiracy

1. The Evening Star of 9 July 1976 carried an inside

Brticle em=itled "Ruby Met With Castro, Sturgis Says". The

Five Parag>ezph article made the following points:

A. Watergate burglar Sturgis says Ruby met
Castrx and discussed "removal" of Kennedy ten weeks
befor= the assassination.

Bt Sturgis passed above information to US
Goveramment agencies in early 1964.

C..  Sturgis' investigation of Cuban exile involve-

ment

- assassination was negative.

d. Sturgis refused to identify agency for which
employesd, but is known to have worked for CIA.

E. Sturgis said his investigation produced evi-
dence ==nat Oswald and Ruby were involved in the same
conspi=~arcy along with other people.

2. The= following comments re Sturgis' remarks are based
ency ress=prds:

A. With regard to the report that Sturgis was
=mployes= by the Agency the report of the Rockefeller

Zommis=:10n on page 252 says that Sturgis testified

under oath that he was never an employee of the
Agency and a search of Agency records revealed no
evidence of such employment in any form.

B. The Agency did fecyar 4 he FBI in CSCI :
3/779,814 on 30 January 1964 that anuneveluated- :
EXILE CKRGANIZAT LEM
Seport of a visit by Ruby to Cuba in late 1962-early

1963 had been received from Havana. This same report
received press distribution and was widely known
in the Cuban exile community in Miami.

C.. There was no confirmatory information for
that report either before or since it was made.

D. 4n considering the matter of Agency diligence
and thoroughness in investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy, the main point is that the in-
formation was reported.

E. There is no record in the Agency that this
information was reported to the Warren Commission
by the Agency & the Bureau. In fact National Archives

state that the Warren Commission records do not contain
the information.

F. On the same point it is noted that in a memo
to the Warren Commission on 15 September 1964 the DDP
Mr. Karamesines said, "The Agency has no indication
that Ruby and Oswald. . . might have been connected in

any manner."
