He did not serve with OSS, however, because he was assigned instead

to so mbat infantry duties in the Southwest Pasific. an 13 December

1950 he was cleared for duty on the island of

as Chief Instructor

in Clandestine Operations. He arrived in

In March 1951. A

(S)

CIA.

4. On 11 July 1953 WOOD telephoned to say that he was

scheduled for brain surgery in Dallas, Texas, on 13 July. He requested

that a ClA representative be present.

No surgery was performed, but

WOOD was given sodium pentothal in connection with a spinal tap.

While under the influence of sodium pentothal Subject said that he had

served overseas with CIA and had seen many people killed. He said

that CIA was a bunch of dirty cut-throats and that he would not be

surprised if they sent one of their men to cut his throat. He also said

that one day he would show CIA that he is smarter than they are.

After

he got well, he would go back to school and get his degree and fight the

CIA with everything he had.

5. An FBI report from Dallas, Texas, 30 April 1957, showed

that Subject had telephoned long distance from Midland, Texas, to a

Chinat intelligence officer in Formosa, claimed former CIA employment,

in Lubbock,

Texas,

he had talked with Chiang KAI-CHEK's intelligence representative in

Formosa and that she and the baby would receive $700 - $1000 a month

"if this thing goes through". (U)
