Author of Anonymous Letter

1. Recently the attached anonymous letter was received

-by.the Deputy Director, Mr. HELMS. -Unfortunately the envelope, -

which presumably the letter was delivered in was destroyed or
lost. Mr. HELMS! secretary who has had occasion to observe
other such questionable correspondence directed to Mr. HELMS

in the past, thought it a matter for the Office of Security to investi-
gate and if possible through apecialized personnel of the Technical
Services Division, attempt to analyse the handwriting as a means
of possibly identifying the author.

2. This suggestion is of course quite valid, consequently
after conducting certain research and discussing the matter with
the Special Activities Stafi/Office of Personnel, two "Surplus
Employees’ (701's) were considered as possibilities as the author
of the aforementioned anonymous letter.

3. However, in all fairness it is to be emphasized that
such tentative consideration is at this time based on purely cir-
cumstantial and coincidental factors--namely in the first instance
that one individual was, according to the Special Activities Staff,
an applicant for the Peace Corps about a year ago, and in the
second instance that the other individual had in August 1964 used
the same identifying title as that appearing on the bottom of the
attachment,

4, Those employees referred to are a Mr. Herman

Edward KIMSEY who was released 20 September, his

ces were declared no longer required and
hho was terminated on 12 July 1962 for the same

reason.

5, In seeking the assistance of your office, you will
also find attached in individually named envelop, vailable
handwriting specimens of Mr. KIMSEY and Mr. It
would be appreciated if these persons handwriting would be°3
compared with the handwritten notation addressed to Mr. HELMS.
It is of course realized that such an analysis based on the little
comparative material available will prove to be difficult but your
efforts and evaluations will be appreciated. # -

6. Since the attached handwriting specimens are origi-
nals from Security and Personnel files, we would appreciate upon
completion of your need for them that they be returned to this
Office.
