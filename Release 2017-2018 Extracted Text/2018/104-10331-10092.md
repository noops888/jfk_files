Fredrick C. Wickham, JI.

DO, Focal Point for ARRB

Position on Release of Information Pertaining to

Employee Names and the JFK Assassination Records

1. At its monthly meeting on 30 January the Assassination

Records Review Board

(ARRB) will address the issue of employee

names contained within the JFK collection.

The names of

employees who retired under cover must continue to be protected.

Because we could not determine the cover status of several

retirees named in the JFK collection, their names also must

continue to be protected on the basis that they might have

retired under cover.

2. The attachment lists those whom we have identified as

having retired in overt or covert status.
