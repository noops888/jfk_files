Subject's declared motivation is complete disenchantment with the
Cuban revolution and the Cuban Government as it currently exists. Evi-
dence that Subject planned his defection is shown by the fact that when
he defected he had prepared himself by procuring classified material
from the DGI files-on the CIS which he brought with him.

Western Europe. For this reason there is no doubt that the CIS has
knowledge that Subject is cooperating with the US Government in intelli-
gence activities.

If Subject were to disassociate himself from his current connection
with the US Government, he would be most likely to collaborate with any
other government which would be involved in attempting to bring about
