The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should

be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is

being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for

instance, whether your sample on the letterhead

memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods.

The summary as written gives no indication as to

the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the

single sentence

now used to describe all of them covers

the waterfront.

If the request for information comes officially

from the Committee, the Committee title should be entered

under "REQUESTOR, "

but if the requestor is an individual

member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.

The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS,"

has particular significance since it is important to

know if there are third Agency, or sources and methods,

or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is

the place to identify them. We are beginning to use

the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to

obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with

the document for which another agency must concur in

the release.

The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such

other agency an idea as to whether we see any important

reason why they should be concerned about release of

the document.

The entry in this final section of the

format is expected to prove useful for this purpose.

One copy of the document or its abstract is ali
