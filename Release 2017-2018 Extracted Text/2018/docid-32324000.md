PCI Williamson previously
notified our New York Office
telephonically with respect to
fight in Cal-Neeva Lodge between
Giancana and Victor Collins,
bodyguard-business manager,
employed by Williamson to accompany
his wife Dorothy McGuire. New York
has been instructed not to contact
Williamson for purpose requested .
as it would likely expose
Williamson as informant. Las Vegas
will be instructed to furnish
lead=-type information to .
Gaming Controél Board for assistance
in their investigation.
