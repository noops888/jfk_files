SPECIE INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

"August

* 1963

PCI Williamson previously

notified our New York Office

telephonically with respect to

fight in Cal-Neeva Lodge between

Giancana and Victor Collins,

bodyguard-business manager,

employed by Williamson to accompany

his wife Dorothy McGuire. New York

has been instructed not to contact

Williamson for purpose requested

as it would likely expose

Williamson as informant.

Las Vegas

will be instructed to furnish

lead-type information to

Gaming Contröl Board for assistance

in their investigation.
