RONALD MOSS, Special Investigator, Alcohol and Tobacco Division,

New York City, on August 5, 1959, advised that Special

Investigator RUDOLPH KALES

conducted an investigation in

September, 1950, concerning an attempt by MEROLA to purchase

firearms

from an Alcohol and. Tobacco Tax Division Informant

whom he identified as ARNOLD RAYBER, a Brooklyn, N. Y.,

gun dealer.

on September 26, 1958, RAYBER contacted Special Investigator

KALES to report that a representative of cuban revolutionary

leader JOSE ALEMAN requested RAYBER to meet with a leader of

the Mafia named JOSEPH MEROLA. Several days later RAYBER met

with MEROLA and two Cubans in an' apartment in the vicinity of

138th St.

and Riverside Drive, New York, N.Y.

meeting MEROLA pointed out that he was associated with ALEMAN

and that he was interested in purchasing large quantities of

firearms including machine guns. MEROLA told RAYBER that he

had been responsible for supplying over a millon dollars

worth of arms during the Cuban rebellion and that he and his

associates anticipated extensive gambling concessions in Cuba

from the revolutionary government:

On the basis of this information the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax

Division temporarily

loaned RAYBER a number of confiscated

weapons in order that he would have a representative stock

to show to MEROLA.

On October; 6, 1958, RAYBER reportea to

KALES

that MeROLA had been to Canada and Miami the previous

week reportedly in connection with some arms deal and had

to annuate

requested RAYBER to accumulate a large pile of American

"stuff" for him.

MEROLA also told rAybEr at that time that

he would have to postpone any purchase of arms since the

Miami area was swarming with FBI Agents looking for stolen

weapons:

RAYBER on August 10, 1959, was interviewed by Special Agents

of the FBI in New York City.

During this interview

confirmed

the foregoing information and positively identified

a photograph of JOSEPH MEROLA, although he could not identify

a photograph of Pittsburgh national top hoodlum SAM

MANNARÍNO.

RAYBER pointed out that about one month after

MEROLA contacted him he (RAYBER) was contacted by CHARLES

COLLE, operator of the Millville Ordinance Co., in Union,

N. Jo,

who said he knew where alot of M-l rifles could be

purchased.

COLLE told RAYBER that the rifles were hot and

were part of the loot lifted from the Canton Armory Job in

Ohio.

COLLE also mentioned that the person who had

the

guns

from the Canton

Armory wanted to get rid of them and

that in order to purchase the guns it would be necessary

to meet the seller in Washington, D. C.; and from there

go to the location where the guns were stored. RAYBER

emphasized that he had no information about the location

of the guns but pointed out that he had told the Alcohol

and Tobacco Tax Division about COLLE but nothing further

materialized:

"The Newark Office was then requested to interview COLLE

regarding-the weapons stolen from the National Guard

Armory, Canton, without compromising RAYBER.

The Newark Office on August 19, 1959, described CHARLES

COLLE, owner and operator of Millville Weapons Corporation,

as an

untrustworthy person on the basis of previous inter-

views

with him on matters not relating to this investigation.

Newark pointed out that although COLLE was not hostile during

continually interview him and occupy his valuable time.

Newark also quoted COLLE as saying that he would never

Inform on anyone except to protect himselt or as would be

required: by law applying to firearms dealers.

Newark recommended against an interview with COLLE in this

case on the basis of his unreliability and also because of the

possibility of disclosing RAYBER as an Alcohol and Tobacco Tax

Division informant.

On September 22, 1959, Pittsburgh requested the New York Office

to re-contact RAYBER to determine whether COLLE gave RAYBER

any indication that he followed through on the meeting with the

seller of the Canton Armory weapons in Washington, D.

.C.

New York Offièe on October 6, 1959, re-contacted RAYBER and

determined that RAYBER claimed he had no, reason to doubt that

COLLE intended to make the trip to washington, D.

C.,. to meet

the seller of the weapons. RAYBER pointed out that COLLE

wanted him to go to washington to meet the seller but after

RAYBER declined COLLE did not indicate whether he followed

through on the deal. RAYBER

said that about one month after

COLLE discussed the trip to Washington, he (COLLE) mentioned

he and leme conta thut ate tomle me rip the arme.

Washington, was discussed COLIF was to have made a telephone

call (person unknown) and then the meeting would be held at

airport in Washington, D. G.

The Pittsburgh Office on September 22, 1959, requested

Newark to interview COLLE regarding the Canton Armory

weapons and the proposed meeting at washington, D. C.

Considerable background Information was furnished to the

Newark Office pointing to the possibility that COLLE could

have met Pittsburgh national top hoodlum SAM MANNARINO in

Washington, D. C.

DR. LOUIS C. PESSOLANO, MIAMI SPRINGS, FLORIDA

By letter dated July 9, 1959, the Bureau was furnished back-

ground information concerning Dr. PESSOLANO and the part he

played in the gun running conspiracy. It was pointed out

that De. PESSOLANO had furnished valuable information which

resulted in the indictment of several co-conspirators in

this

case and could place national top hoodlum SAM

MANNARINO in the conspiracy but was afraid to do so because of

his

fear of being assassinated by the MANNARINO mob

On the

basis that Dr. PESSOLANO was in an awkward position of facing

a perjury indictment and possible disgrace in the medical

profession because of his connection with this case, the

Bureau was

requested to authorize the expenditure of $160 to

cover airline fare and hotel accomodations for the doctor

to travel to Pittsburgh where he would be interviewed by Agents

of the Pittsburgh office.

By airtel dated July 16, 1959, the Bureau authorized Pittsburgh

to provide for travel and expenses of Dr

PESSOLANO where he

would be interviewed in an effort to place MANNARINO in the.

conspiracy.
