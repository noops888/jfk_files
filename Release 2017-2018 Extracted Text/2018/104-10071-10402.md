March' 20-1964:

¡ friend of mine had se neet a Captain of the Greek Ship " San Spiridon" a

alnoat nado ne

his-my name or address or anything about myself, except that I told me that

I had a wife and child whom I have not

seen for almost 3 years, In the U.S.

and had all of my papers necessary to leave here,

except a visa to Mex100,1

cold hin that I reason that I had wanted to leave here soon, was that my wife"

was sick and I dia not want to walt until my Vexican Visa came through, After

I hour of hin telling me how nuch he cared

for Americans and for the U.s. eto.

he told me that ho would get me out,

by hiding me ir a boller until the ship

left Havana He said that he could not hide me in his cabin, as he was afrald

that after the anio wag searched and I should be found, then he would get into

trouble, but 11 I should be found in the bolder,

than he can say that I had

sneakea aboard myself, without his knowledge,

after I agreed. to and of that

I asked him, how much?And his answer was; & 1500.00 (Fifteen Hundred) AFRICAd

DOLLARS, after which d laughed in his fave, ane saked him where in the world

would a person in Cuba get 1500 Dollars, he woula not take posos, as he said

that he had thousands of pesos in his pocket that he made by selling American:

Cigarettes for 30 pesos per carton. led to male a long story short,

I told hin

to Iorget the whole thing, and the ship left here this afternoon for St. Johna

in Newfoundland. The usual charge here for getting people out ia about 300

American Dollars or 2500 pesos,

but this Captain thinks as all foreigners do

that Americans are all wealthy,

aid as for doing something for a human being.

Ior nothing, well that they will not do. Il I had the money, I would never

pay 1t, let alone even trust a man 11ke

this Captain. As it looks ko I WIll

not got a Mexican Viea, I am now going to try to get out or here by launoh,

I cannot stay here nuch longer 11ke Iam, and 1t 13 better for me to take a

chance by launch,

Instead or

just sitting around, and maybe get into trouble

at any time now. I just came from the Swisa Enbassy again, and they tole me

that they had not received an abnwer. frum Switzerland regarding my case that

they had malled aoout o weeks ago, and also that the only people who could get

a Mexican Visa for me, 18 the American Embassy In Mexico City. The Swies Embass

can give out advice every day, but as for doing anyruing, they are afraidont

she swios sundry hero in Havana, & Cuban stands a better chance or getting

helped than an Arerican,. but I cannot say anything to them, as I am stall here.

PLEASE do not tell my wife that I an going to try to got out by launch, as I

don't want to have her worry more than she does now.
