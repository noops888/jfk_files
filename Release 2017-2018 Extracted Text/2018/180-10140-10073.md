on Assassinations requests access to all files and index refer-

ences pertaining to the following

individuals:

1) MAURICE BISHOP, aka JOHN BISHOP, JIM BISHOP, and ENU

FIRGAULT.

individual's true name is not known to the Committee.

Bishop was

working in anti-Castro operations in the

early 1960s.

He was also allegedly involved in a plot

to assassinate Fidel Castro in Chile in 1971 with An-

tonio Veciana and Luis Posada.

2) WIROGUE - CIA agent involved in the ZRRIFLE program.

Further identifying information on the following individuals

will be given orally, pursuant to an agreement between Bob Genzman

Whether or not any of the individuals listed below had

any relationship with the CIA, they may believe that'actions

they have taken were at the direction of responsible persons.

in the Central Intelligence Agency.

Accordingly, in order for

the Select Committee to obtain truthful statements and ulti-

mately testimony from these individuals, it would be most use-

ful for the Committee to have a letter from your office e-

leasing these persons of any obligations of secrecy they may

have made to the CIA, or to anyone whom these individuals may

believe was affiliated with the CIA.
