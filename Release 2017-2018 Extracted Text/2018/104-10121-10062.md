SUBJECT: LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE
(Address Book)

1. Reference is made to names in OSWALD's address hook
which are furnished in an FBI memorandum of 31 December 1963,
which lists portions of the address book found among CSWALD's per-
sonal effects at the time of his arrest in Dallas.

2. On page 45 of OSWALD's address book (pages 16 and
17 of the FBI's report of 31 December 1963), there appears the notation:

"20575 Sharapov

Minsk Y Gseyacnds HOF
House No. 4, Apt. 24a
UL. KALININA" 4

This name appears also as: “Comrade Sharapov 20525" on a strip of
paper found in OSWALD's wallet at the time he was interviewed by Lt.
Francis L. MARTELLO of the New Orleans police.

3. SHARAPOV could conceivably refer to one of several
persons by that name who are referred to in Security Indices:

(1) Lt. Col, Nikolai Georgiyevich SHARAPO'
who is an RIS career officer described as an old-time
Chekist with interrogation experience, whe in 1942
was chief of a small counter-espionage section in the
Second Directorate of the NKVD. In 1942 he held the
rank of Captain and as of some time after February
1954 was chief of a section in the Seventh Chief
Directorate, IVD. He is said to have participated

in the arrest of SERIA. SHARAPOV was born about

1909, was married, and as of 1953/54 had a 13 year

old son. He also had daughters aged 7 and 3 by a mistress,
Olga KHOKHLOVA. It should be noted that this SHARAPOV
has a son about OSWALD's age. In a CIA Information
Report of 24 February 1955 titled, "Organization, Functions
and Personalities of the NKGB," Nikolay SHARAPOV was
listed as the "Sub Section Chief" of the Surveillance Section
{NN) of the "Incependent Sections of the NKGB".

(2) According to the 1930 testimony of E. Y.
BELITSKIY aka Yefim BELITSKIY, the father of Boris
Yefimovich BELITSKIY, #175069-SSD, one P. LL. SHARAPOV
was at one time a Director of the All-Russian Textile

_ Syndicate in New York City, as he (E. Y. BELITSKIY)

also had been. The Syndicate, he said, was actually part
of the Soviet Government and was controlled as such.
See attachment re Boris ¥Y. BELITSKIY.

(3) According to information furnished to the FBI
in 1948 by Mikhail Ivanovich SAMARIN (aka Mr. GREGORY),
“AI 116, one Lt, General Andrei Rodionovich SHARAPOV_ -
of the Soviet Military Staff Committee at the United Nations
{as well as Lt. General Alexander Filippovich VASILIEV)
was involved in Soviet espionage. According to SAMARIN,
he obtained this information during a discussion he had
with Eugene Vasilievich GALAKHOV of the Soviet U.N.
delegation in about June 1948.. According to SAMARIN,
General SHARAPOV took over all the duties of General
VASILIEV, Head of the First Department of Soviet Intelli-
gence in the United States, when the latter departed—
apparently shortly before June 1948.

SUBJECT: BELITSKTY, Boris Yefimovich -#175069 - SSD
MOSBY, Aline #172252

According to several sovrces Boris Y. Belitskiy is an associate of
Aline Mosby, whose name eppeared in Oswald's address book. (Page 61 of
the address book, which is on page 22 of the FBI memorandum of 31
December 1963. She is mentioned also in CI/SIG's cover memorandum
dated 10 January 1964.)

According to R/2/CE, #56948 SD & SSD, in September
1958, Aline Mosby contact with Boris Y. Belitskiy, e
Russian officiel at-the Brussels World, ir, and "was the center of a
great deal of activity for (him)". €) stated that Belitskiy, who was
the Head of the British Division of Radio Moscow,had been an interpreter
for the Russians at the Brussels World Fair. He previously had been in
the United State th his father, who wes with AMPORG in the late 1920's/
early 1930's. said that Belitskiy attended school in New York City
end that the family returned to Russia a 1936 or 1937.

__ With further reference to vost, [notes at there was a direct
relationship between Mosby, Koch (Carl Henry Koch, #50001) and Volkoff
(George Volkoff,” #152385 - SSD) — all of whom had been of interest with
reference to Belitskiy.

Others whom Mosby knew included Atexanter porSSce, #165651 - SSD,
to whom she was introduced by McKinney H, Russel1/-293853 - SSD, still
another who was of interest in connection with Belitskiy.

ct/siIc was advised in late 1958 regarding the above individuals and
informed that CI/OA was also interested in them.

According to information furnished by Fitzgerald Curtis Smith,
#176178 + SSD, during a debriefing in June 1959, Boris Y. Belitskiy, whom
Smith knew in Moscow, was in great fear of being purged, "as was his
father, a Russian Jew, who had once lived in New York." According to
Smith, Belitskiy knew and trusted no U.S. citizens in Moscow other than
himself (Smith) and Aline Mosby, UPI correspondent in Moscow. Smith aaid
Belitskiy met Aline Mosby at the Brussels World Fair in the sumer of 1958,
at the same time he met Smith. Smith said he subsequently contacted
Belitskiy in Moscow in December 1958, through NBC Correspondent Irvine R.
Levine.



Another who knows, or has know, Aline Mosby is former Agency employee
George Winters, 755769. Winters stated during an interview in November/
December 1960, when discussing Americans in Moscow who lived beyond their
means, that newspaperman Harry Schapiro*was a very heavy loser at poker —
to the extent that “one got the impression he was on the Soviet budget."
Schapiro, he said, had e Russian wife who was more aggressive than he.
Winters added that newspaperwoman Aline Mosby was in Schapiro's office;
and commented that she "stuck mostly to the Foreign circuit rather than
the Embassy circuit." He said that she had been in the hospital on several
ocassions during the previous year, so that “one didn't see too much of her"}
and added that according to gossip one hospitalization was ocassioned by an
abortion.

Another newspaperwoman in Moscow, whom Winters mentioned, was Priscilla
Johnson, #71589-DL. She has been mentioned in newspaper articles as one who
recalled having come in contact. with Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow, where she
interviewed (or talked) with him. Her name, like Mosby's,was listed in his
address book under her lest name only.

Mosby was born on 27 July 1922 in Missoula, Montane; and graduated
from the University of Montana in 1943. She was employed by United Press
in Seattle, Washington, from 1943 to 1945, and was Hollywood Correspondent
for UP from 1945 to 1957. According to the UP Bureau Menager at Los Angeles,
she resigned voluntarily in 1957 and her employment was satisfactory. Ac-
cording to Confidential informant R-1, during an Agency investigation in the
fall of 1958, she was dropped by UP when she was subpoeaned in connection
with legal suits against Confidential Magazine, for which she had done re-
write work without the knowledge of UP. She went to the Brussels World Fair
as a stringer for the North American Newspaper Alliance. She was considered
loyal by her associates during the above period; but was described as "the
co-existence type who essociates with Russians" ("plays footsie with the
Russians"). No informant questioned her loyalty.

In Jenuary 1960, Mosby reportedly was introduced on the Dave Garroway
Show, "Today", as NBC News' Correspondent; but in a State Department dis~-
patch of 12 December 1960, which listed "Western Correspondents in Moscow",
she was named as representing UPI.

According to HCUA records, Mosby did m motion picture critic type
article for the Daily Worker in 1947; wrote an article for the Daily Worker
at Lagune Beach, California, in 1949; and contributed a column to the Daily
Worker on 23 November 1956. According to records of the Civil Service Con-
mission, the Daily Worker of 26 July 1957 and 29 August 1957 carried infor-
mation regarding her.
