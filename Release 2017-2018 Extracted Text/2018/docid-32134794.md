"rom many years ago.

They advised that RUBY was never anything but

"a punk" and never had any hoodlum connections or associations. One

person advised that he recalls that RUBY attempted to sneak into a

prize fight in Chicago, believed to be the second DEMPSEY - TUNNEY

fight, and was caught by a police officer who beat him over the head

with his night stick. As a result of this beating; RUBy now has a
