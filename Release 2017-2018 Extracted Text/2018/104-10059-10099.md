2. Investigation has recently been completed with generally

favorable results. However, Subject's military file indicated that

he had been found unfit for duty due to excessive drinking, and

had been allowed to retire in the best interests of the Navy.

Navy record stated that this drinking problem adversely affected

his judgement, reliability, and personal behavior.

This weakness

had been discussed to no avail with Subject on several occasions.

tion of over-indulgence since his departure from the military on

October 1964.

the loyalty of Subject's brother.

to have been associated with known Communists and was active in

Communist matters in the Los Angeles, California area during this

period of time. However, it was noted that these activities had

caused a break with this individual and his family, who were not

in sympathy with his viewpoints and activities.
