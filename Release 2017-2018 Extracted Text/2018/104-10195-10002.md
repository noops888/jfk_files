As. 1s normal

I subject has no supervisory duties with

'HERALD personnel but hls cover job provides supervisory responsibility.

Subject is meticulous in presentation of financial accountings and his

operational expenses are, modest. There are no administrative problems

level; in point of fact, it would, in the writer's opinion, merit a solid "S",

but no more.

Recognizing that such ratings are perforce subjective, ond

that the rating officer has a closer, almost daily experience factor,

nonecheless, the reviewer simply does not believe that the written record of

the NOC's accomplisiments on the specific targets will support an "0"

rating at this time. Even accepting the limitations which the cover

situation imposes upon

I hehas still' not performed in a manner

which vould correspond to theliteral definition of "0".

Other than this divergency, the reviewer shares the laudatory comments

set forth in the narrative

He is all the things the rater has

stated and more: highly intelligent, versatile, linguistically excremely

well qualified, and professionally experienced in his cover role.

He has

begun very well to utilize this new cover position on the Organization s

behalf, and it is quite accurate to note that

landed this particular

plus (in terms of competition for the cover vacancy) solely on the basis of

his own demonstrated: talents in the cover context.

In suri,

this is an crporienced, mifective

whore nui cover affordo him

an expanded natural access to a host of the Station's primary targets; he has

begun to exploit this access in a sound, logical fashion, and the period ahead

should further document the utility of his key situation to our operational

programs.

In fairness to all concerned, it is simply too early in this new

position to attempt a definitive judgment of the depth of access which can be

derived irom it.

Commenta by chief,

Although concurring with an overall rating of "g", I consider the "g"

-ratings for specific duties nubers one and two to be sonewhat high and I recommend

"g" for both.

Casasin certaialy has maintained his cover and we anticipate

he will be able to preserve it 1a his new job. He has just begun to initiate

contacts with Suviet personnel of operational interest and it renalas to be seen

During the period covered by this report subjoct's job with a scientifie

own efforts and win no BKTRUST belp, obtained & minilar position (ae

SECTION C. NARRATIVE (continued)

It has been noted in paot litess reporte that subjoct was wonk in

long-rango, operational developmont of a target. The ease and

probable ouccese O1 an extended development le a function of the

personalities involved. During this reporting period subject has

conducted a sustained development of an MHHARSHER despite their

ditterest agon and divergent personalities thus demonstrating

Improvement in this aros.

It some times appeara that subject'i reporting could be more

precise and more closely ttuned to BKTRUST objectives.

This le

probably the result of time limitatione, and the

officer's knowledge

of BKTRUST needs is lessened by his relative isolation.

As is normal

situation, aubject has no supervisory dutles

witn BKTRUST personnel. His cover job provided supervisory

responaibility: Subjece ne meticulous in presentation of financial

accountinge and his operational expenses are modest.

Section: 3 - Comments br: Reviening Official

The carcer of this

officer has reached a crucial

junctures if,

as we currently anticipate, he succeeds in

landing

the position for which he appears to have the inside

track could prove no dein fouanier inscion

and its employees

could prove to be invaluable.

His new function will per

mit the widest possible access to a variety of targets, and

v i th

caretul guidance,

his utility as a spotter and assessor should

improve very substantially

The report notes that this officer has conducted a lengthy

dialogue with an MHHARSH target; it is quite accurate that our

_has handled himself sell in a situation where disparity. in

age and background renors the relatiothis

someshat inconerous.

Nonetheless,

accurect resires that so mirid that the doc's

interlocutor has obviously not maintained this ongoing relation-

one occasion

in the preparation of restricted distribution reports on

local situation, even though the particular topic was in itself

totally innocuous.

For these reasons die continue to monitor

this relationship

with great care,

particularly since we simply

cannot assess

its longer range viability and the direction it

is likely to take.

In sum,

has done, the best he could under somewhat

trying circumstances, exacerbated by the serere economic problens

of his erstwhile emplojer, which led to the NOC's being separated

from that position at the

end of last rear.

Through his own

efforts,

learned of the vacancy for which he has'applied,

and by assiduous and discriminating canirulation of his extensive

connections on the local scene, has sanaged to maneuver himself

into becoming the leadir candidate sor the post.

If he is

accepted for

this position, his value to the organication vill

unquestionably increase by a quantum leap, and we are consequently

optimistic concerning his future abilit) o make an impressive

contribution to Organicational goals on the local scene.

On balance, we are pleased that thie officer has responded so well to

made arrangements for their physicals as private citizens, on the

pretense that they required statements that they were in good

health in order to obtain

Obviously, forms 88 were not

prepared; the attached certificates of good health and freedom

from contagious diseasc are all that is nornally jiven to private
