COuMENTS OF REVIEDING OFFICIAL
The staticn submitted comments on Subject officer recently in OF7T-
16549 (8 April 1971), to which we should add that Subject has, largely
on his om merits, acquired a solid and potentially highly useful :
‘cover employment, However, this new employment will demand a very
substantial amount of tima and energy from Sitject, and the unanswere
able question at tle moment relates to his availability for Organiza-
tional tasks. We shall need additional time and careful working with
this officer to determine the answer, since the fiscal outlay from the
Organization to support his continued stay in Paris ia still quite

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory functioa,
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He ia careful _

During the period under review, additional efforts have been

substantial, Zn a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,
although ‘our initial inpressions are favorable.

On the fitnoss report itself, this rater would have

“an "s° rating for specific duty number one; Subject may uicieeesiy

deserve an "0", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the "P" category, rather than °s",

but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
who is more intimately and directly involved with subject ‘on a
frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will reveal to
what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on be-
half of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely
and will be compenting upon it subsequently as we gain experience

and knowledge.

(a) are essential to the continued existen¢e and security of the
cover mechanism as a vehicle for operational exploitation, and.
(b) are not necessarily visible to those “on the inside."

In the case of (a), X must engage in a constant orchestration of

Afterall, the cover position is to then a. legitimate, normal,
workaday post in their fira. What wo is done at their bidding,
it follows, must be accomplished according to the high standards
of thoroughness and accuracy which they have set.

In the -case-of (b) +- which derives frox (a) -- and can prove to
be so demanding that the needs of the CS could no longer be served, -
the incumbent’ is required to manage a span of huzan contacts at
several levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance
its value to the CS, This means planning, directing and

managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of

technical correspondents, as well as meetings and negotiations to
improve the cover firna's) relations oh similarly widespread

the levels of editor-in-chicf, publisher, corporate

Having previously managed both a CS base and the principal denied

quite honestly that my present managerial responsibilities exceed
the former -- despite the apparent lack of "supervisory

responsibilities" in my present position.

made arrangenents for theix physicals as private citizens, on the

from contagious disease are all that is normally given to private
individuals we hope they suffice.
