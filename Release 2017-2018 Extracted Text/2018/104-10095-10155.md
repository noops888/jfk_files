1. On 25 September 1978, a call was received in the

Security Duty Office from James A. Sherman, Subject's brother,

advising that Subject suffered a fatal heart attack on

23 September 1978 at his apartment in Monterey, California.

Subject was sixty years of age and had a history of previous

heart trouble.

Agency as a military detailee, 1952 - 1954, when he was

5.

The only aspect of this incident, which may be of

continuing security concern, is that the

son recalls

that

in May 1978, while assisting his father in moving some

personal effects, he remembers seeing. a written plan to

assassinate Fidel Castro.

The son said that it had been

prepared by his father in the early 1970's when he was

working in Florida but at a time when he had no Agency

association.

At this time the paper is still missing.

It may have been recently destroyed by the Subject or, the

possibility exists, it may have been stolen by someone

having access to the apartment. ' According to Subiect's

soh, several other items were missing, including a money

clip containing a $100 bill that his father always kept,

a Randall knife,

a gold pen and pencil set and a microwave

oven.

After notifying the police of the missing personal

items, Subject's son received the knife from the resident

manager who claims to have found it in some weeds.

Subject's

son suspects that the resident manager may have been responsible

for the theft of the personal items, but he has now resolved

drop the entire issue.

6. Foreign Resources Division has advised that the

DCI has been briefed on this case.

It is therefore felt

that no further Office of Security action is required at this

time other than to monitor the case for 60-90 days to

determine if any new developments occur.
