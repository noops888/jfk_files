Ceollio says it is ubsurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering ja1l where OSWALD vas). Juliets tys

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with th

police and newspepermen.

It was perfectly planned, indeed some of the

pollo probably are of the same orgenization because Ruby mutckhan

Kurtikhs gangemduasalutex aimed the gun at his chest (OSWALD'a).

Coollin agrees, the plotur is evidence of that because the police

did not; move to try to get in or anything for

within a question of

seconds there should have peen

& reaction.

Julieta hopes they will

continue the investigation; at least Kennedy's brother has sent a special

agent. Cecilia says everything about it is strange as the puper stated

they found this charzoter (Ruby) drinking Coca Cole on the second floor

and they jut left him there.

Julieta adds that from the & very firat

everything was absurd, that he was a Communist.

Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned and that is evident since the bullet was aimad at Kennedy.

Juliets believes

that this: 18 all done by extreme ricktists planned

bilk.

Julieta adds; that she hopes they will wake up & little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it 1s evident it 1s eii &

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men.

She adds that in a very

obvious way this individual (OSWALD) pretended he was & Communiss to

prepare the groundwork.

Cecilla believes that he even purposely married

the Russian girl!

Julieta comments that all was very well prepared,

step by step to blame the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD's

desth) everything is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the

Investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death of

OSWALD the case was closed, but the FBI answered Immediately that It vas

not closed, that lon the contrary, they had to open an investigation und

also the Senate will name a commission to investigate, and Julieta hopes

they won't be alarmed at whatever may be turned up.

She adds that cuch

time more details i confirm that OSWALD was & Fascist and this business of

trying to join an anti-Castro organization and later poke his nose into!

he Falt Play for Cube surely all of this was made up by the dallas police

agrees, indeed it was a perfect shot with exact calculation and could nos

have been done spontaneously. Julieta says that his (OSWALD's) death

was evidently to shut him up

and they had better not say now that Ruby

was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because, Ruby is the

SLCKET

MEXI 7104 | Amb Mann asks that following be passed to Sec. Rusk.

He presumes KUBARK und

ODENVY will be advised. ¡Sinos my cable of yesterday (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above) there have

been three principal developments: 1) Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 hrs last evening culled

DORTICOS of Cuba. In this conversatiop, which like the firat is taged, DORTICOS expressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia about morey.

ALVARADO, the Nio, was questioned by CAs officer until two a.m. this morning.

This

officer was impressed by ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a witness anu

who 1s now hiding in place provided by CAS.! We cannot guarentee ALVARADO's safety.

Wealth

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities Involved with OSWALD in Cub Eub

1s striking, 3) At 1215 hrs Next time 27 Nov. CAS offloer was edwised by phone by

ECHEVERRIA! that he had rearrested Silvia today because he learned she wes attemptine to

leave Mext for Habana. However, yoheverrid later told LEGAT that he had decided to rearrest

silvia to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as i

witness, Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem. (MEXI 7072 - rar: i1 above)

we have not requested Mexi gov to takelg any aotion against Silvia except to maintain

Increased surveillance of her activities.

Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he led any

specifio concrete evidence that she was about to leave for cube.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurete..

ut is quite possible, and even probable, that cuntra

diotory atatements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of COM to play down, importance

of oswarD visit here.

Mexi line still is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria statedito LEGAI that DORIICOS only interested in finding

out whether Mexi authoritles tried to pay a story from silvia.

This is obviously incrorrect

Interpretation.| Neither| LOPDZ Mateor nor Echeverria Know of ALVARADO's story.

Pls rote

that according Echeverrie Silvia ls being taken to Attorney General's office to which

Mexi press has easy access, Possiblity of habeds corpus cannot be discounted.

4) 12

have as yet found no trace of, the red hended Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him. 5) In addition to questions raised in yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently consider feasibility of requesting Mexi authorities to arrest

for interrogation,

office at Guadalajara to! issue a tioket to Hilario ROJAS of 665 Chilarde Street, Cunialajara.

It is noted that ROJAS has stated that he formerly resided at Chilarde Street in Guadalajara.)

: ROJAS appears to be in normel physical condition and no outward signs observed of my nch_1

defiolency.

He' did not reveal any mental quirks. He tends to be voluble in his conversa-

tions

and to wander from speolfic lines of questioning. / He appears to react mentelly in a

manner reflecting Innate Intelligence superior to that of his stated sixth grade edusation. /

He does not volunteer any motive for furnishing info to the U. S. Gor concerning his alleged

association with unidentified Cubans and with OSWALD, both at .U.S, border and at Connel. /

Other than'discrepanoies anting noted in various Interviews conducted with ROJAS, tu: only

apparently unusual development concerns a reportedly second letter that he has directed to

U. S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, wherein he, according to his om statement,

stated

that he had additional info to furnish.

According to ROJAS,

this additional info coicerned

a' so-called camera which he saw In Cozumel in the possession of the unidentified Juling and

OSWALD, which camera reportedly had adaptations which could be utilized to fire about five

cartridges, whioh cartridges reportedly have a small gas compartment and thut said Lus was

for the purpose of cutting down on the; noise made in firing said camera, He also described

ai rifle supposedly in the possession of these previously mentioned Individuals. He claims to

have beenxyul told by the Cubans that the "camera" was worth about $50,000 and was a Russian

Invention. / Attitude toward Polygraph! Examination:'It was explained to ROJAS that It might

ba-necessarin, the trüture to afford him a scientific examination with the use of certain.

Instrumenté.. He said he would be agreeable, to such an examination. / Attitude of Merican

Government Iro Polygraph Examination, It ls assumed that, as in the past case of the Nic,

Echeverria should be so consulted and his authorization obtained to conduet said erimination,

At the same time, he canlalso be told that general results of exam vould be furnish.i him.

/It i's further surrested that the full nome ofiroJAs should be fumished Echoverri: und the

fect that he would be examined either in GuadalaJara' or Mexi, There does not appea: to be

any reason for icheverria to be furnished the iden of the Polygraph examiner..

Sebastian PIREZ Fèrnandez, desk clerk and assistant to the oner of the Hotel del Comercio,

had not conversed with OSWALD but remembered him clearly because, few Americans, stay at the

after PERiZ fernandez had completed his yorking day and left the hotel.

RODRIGUEZ walked around the corner from the hotel where he obtalned a taxicab. He believed

OSWALD left the hötel between 0630 and 0700 since it was getting light when ho went in

search of the taxicab.. He could not be nore precise conceraing the time. He believed

OSWALD gave him a small tip of one or two pesos.

OSWAUD caried his lown luggage downstairs

and walted in front of the hotel with the luggage unt1l RODRIGUEZ returned with the taxicab.

RODrIcuez commented that while he had little difficulty obtaining a taxi at the early hour,

It beoomes vory difficult to secure taxi transportation between 0730 and 0830 because of the

heavy traffid at that time,

RODRIGUEZ related that OSWALD always arrived at the hotel late

without wearing a coat???

at hight, "midnight or thereafter", but he never noticed any indication that OSWALD had been

drinking.

MENO TO FBI frOM WOFACI An untested source recently furiched us vita tho foli into he

allegedly received fron a veil known Cuban solentlat and aoqualntance on 23 Noy 63, but which

he had forgotton to report.

"the release of the Warren Com Report rominded him of the inel-

dent. / The soientist said he had been at the flavaha alrport on afternoon of 22 Nov, 63 waGn

at 1700 hrs an airoraft with Moxi markings landed and parked at far side of the fleld.

Two men, whom he tooognized as Cuban & "gangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance

administration blde and disappeared without going through normal customs proceduros.

His

curlosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived fron

Dallas, Texas, vid IlJuana and Mexi City. The plane had been forced to lard at| IIjuana due

to engine troublo

By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, ho theorized that tho two men must have beon invblved in essassination..

He speculated that OSwAlD lad acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

n pallas to organize or oversed the operation. He told the source that he had bech greatly

listrossed by what he had jeen and heard and had to telll someone about it. Hò theh cautione
