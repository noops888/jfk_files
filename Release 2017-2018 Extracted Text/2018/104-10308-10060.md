HIGHLIGHTS OF AMLEO/3'S DEBRIEFING

These are the highlights of my debriefing of AMLEO/3.
They are elaborated upon in this and other reports.

1. CASTRO may permit onsite inspection by appropriate
TD. N. observers. CASTRO will then ask for a no-invasion pledge
by the U.S.

2. CASTRO is the complete master of everything and everyone
in Cuba. CASTRO's five points were extremely well received and
fully subscribed to by practically every Cuban in Cuba.

3. The professional officer cadre of the Cuban Navy and
the officers of the rebel army, as opposed to those of the militia,
are the element most likely to conspire against the Communist

oriented direction of Fidel's government.

The shortage of doctors in Cuba has made it necessary
for CASTRO to prohibit their further exit and in addition he has
recently raised their pay and given each a new automobile. A
further exodus of doctors from Cuba will cause a “panic"™ on the

Sour doctes_
Island. This is one item the Soviets cannot furnish. ce Not mane

5. A further departure of engineers would likewise 4
the regime, but they can be replaced by Soviet and Czech
technicians.

6. he infiltration of black teams into Cube is futile,
eon produccivel and suicidial. The counter-surveiliance block | Hodk
makes black living impossible in the cities and towns.

7. When the CRC goes, Fidel won't be able to hold the
flood of Cubans seeking reinge in the U. Ss.

8. Fidel suspects the Communists to have an underground
apparatus. Blas ROCA is the leader of this apparat.

9. Fidel is bothered considerably when Carlos Rafael
RODRIGUEZ is made out to be the main cog of the Cuben government.

10. The death of Fidel would result in a free for all--with
each army.commander digging in for a show down. Cziculated to
go 5 is Raul; given 2 good chance for survival, in union with
rebel army and navy leaders, would be "Che"; the Comies would
lose out. To AMLEO/3, the death of Fidel would be the best
answer to all.

ll. AMLEO/3 has a group of about 10 important people:

A. Conchita FERNANDEZ and her husband

B. U.N. Delegate Raul PRIMELLES.

12, AMLEO/3 believes these would make ideal psychological
themes:

A. A subtle, careful build-up of Carlos Rafael
RODRIGUEZ. This could begin with pictures of Fidel and
Carlos Rafael conferring in the Sierra Maestra. I believe
such pictures exist. The showing of CR as Fidel's mentor

both in Marxism-Leninism and in "how to organize a country"

will hurt Fidel.© C17 Xeshige r=

B. Certainly the Chief/SAS's idea of doing the seme with

"Che" would be even more to the point. "Che" is known to

be a prodigious worker, "brilliant," popular and one who

does not fear Fidel. These are facets of Che's character
Ww

which Fidel undoubtedly would not like to hear!too often.

C. The truth must be employed--the use of materials

easily proved to be "lies" are extremely damaging and extremely

well exploited by Fidel.
D. Postal cards (in color) showing the food counter of

a Hot Shoppe or-Howard Johnson. AMLEO/3 was genuinely moved

by the "beauty" of the food counter of a Hot Shoppe we visited.

E, The pemphlets which gave the populace instructions
in simple sabotage techniques were "bothersome" and damaging
to the Cuban govermment.
13. Psychological warfare which was not well received:
A. Those works showing Fidel as a beast with long,
bloody claws, or as a donkey pulling Khrushchev in a wagon.
B. The "gusano" theme has not been noticed to any
degree (at least not by AMLEO/3). He considers this "too
common" a theme to have any value.
14. There will be no revolt or uprising by eiements within
Cuba, unless the “fiame" of resistance is kept alive and the

hope of outside help is not lost.
