DRAFT

HIGHLIGETS OF AMLEO/3'S DEBRIEFING

These are the highlights of my debriefing of AMLEO/3.

They are elaborated upon in this and other reports.

1. CASTRO may permit onsite inspection by appropriate

D. N. observers. CASTRO will then ask for a no-invasion pledge

by the D.s.

2. CASTRO is the complete master of everything and everyone

in Cuba. CASTRO's five points were extremely well received and

• fully subscribed to by practically every Cuban in Cuba.

3. The professional officer cadre of the Cuban Navy and

the officers of the rebel army, as opposed to those of the militia,

are the element most likely to conspire against the Communist

oriented direction of Fidel's government.

4. The shortage of doctors in Cuba has made it necessary

for CASTRO to prohibit their further exit and in addition he has

recently raised their pay and given each a new automobile. A

further exodus of doctors from Cuba will cause a "panic" on the

SovieT cloctore

Island. This is one item the Soviets cannot furnish. ke Not foisi.

5. A further departure of engineers would likewise damage

the regime, but they can be replaced by Soviet and Czech

technicians.

6. The infiltration of black teams into Cuba is futile,

non-productive, and suicidial. The counter-surveillance block Hock

makes black living impossible in the cities and torns.

7. When the CRO goes, Fidel won't be able to hold the

flood of Cubans seeking Iefuge in the U.S.

8. Fidel suspects the Communists to have an mderground

apparatus. Blas ROCA is the leader of this apparai.

9. Fidel is bothered considerably when Carlos Rafael

RODRIGUEZ is made out to be the main cog of the Cuban government.

10. The death of Fidel would result in a free for all--with

each army. commander digging in for a show down. Caiculated to

go down is Raul; given a good chance for survival, in union with

rebel army and navy ieaders, would be "Che"; the Comies would

lose out. To AMLEO/3, Ene death of Fidel would be the best

answer to all.

11. AMLEO/3 has a group of about 10 important people:

A. Conchita FERNANDEZ and her husband

B.

U. N. Delegate Raul PRIMELLES_

C.

12.

AMLEO/3 believes these would make ideal psychological

themes:

A. A subtle, careful build-up of Carlos Rafael

RODRIGUEZ. This could begin with pictures of Fidel and

Carlos Rafael conferring in the Sierra Maestra. I belíeve

such pictures exist. The showing of CR as Fidel's mentor

both in Marxism-leninism and in "how to organize a country"

will hurt Fidel ticinEa

• B. Certainly the Chief/SAS's idea of doing the same with

"Che" would be even more to the point. "Che" is known to

be a prodigious worker, "brilliant," popular and one wno

does not fear Fidel. These are facets of Che's character

which Fidel doubledly would not like to hearitoo often.

C. The truth must be employed--the use of materials

easily proved to be "lies" are extremely damaging and extremely

well exploited by Fidel.

D. Postal caros (in color) showing the food counter of

a Hot Shoppe or Howard Johnson. AMLEO/3 was genuinely moved

by the "beauty" of the food counter of a hot shoppe we visited.

E. The pamphlets which gave the populace instructions

in simple sabotage techniques were "bothersome" and damaging

to the Cuban government.

13. Psychological warfare which was not well received:

A. Those works showing Fidel as a beast with long,

bloody claws, or as a donkey pulling Khrushchev in a wagon.

B. The "gusano" theme has not been noticed to any

degree (at least not by AMLEO/3). He considers this "too

common" a theme to have any value.

14. There will be no revolt or uprising by elenents within

Cuba, unless the "fiane" of resistance is kept alive and the

hope of outside help is not lost.
