MM 92-853

- ADMINISTRATIVE -

This is a joint report of SAS JOHN C. PHELPS, WILLIAM

F. HEIST.

ROBERI A. COOK and DON W. WALTERS.

In those instances where information was received

from informants in other divisions, the location for such

information will be set forth from files in the Miami Division.

The investigation regarding HYMAN MARTIN and his

associates has failed to develop any information which would

link him with LA COSA NOSTRA, the "Commission" or any

Italian criminal or gambling group. The section entitled

the "HYMAN MARTIN GROUP" is therefore being deleted from

this report.
