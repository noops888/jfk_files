Dear Mr. Kirbow:

This refers to your 10 July telephone request for:

1) a

newspaper article printed before the death of

President Kennedy in which Castro indicated that Castro

was aware of a plot to assassinate Castro; and 2) a news-

paper article in more recent weeks in which Castro said that

if the American Congress wanted to know about plots to

assassinate Castro it only had to ask Castro.

On the first question, Daniel Harker filed from Havana

a report of

an informal interview given to him at a

Brazilian Embassy reception on Saturday, 7 September 1963.

This was not a public speech.

The Harker item appeared in

the Washington Star and in the Times Picayune of New Orleans.

Please see Tab l.

These are accurate transcripts but we

don't have photographic copies available.

Our answer to your second question may not be precisely

what you want since it is based on a Swedish newspaper report,

and not one which appeared in a Cuban or Washington newspaper

as you had thought.

It is attached as Tab 2.

MI. Daniel O'Flaherty

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

Room G-308, Dirkson Senate Office Building

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Dan:

In keeping with our conversation and discussion of Monday,

21 July 1975, regarding what I feel could be accomplished by getting to-

gether on a more formal basis with the Committee, is as follows.

First, I feel I could definitely show that Robert Kennedy was the

major instigator during the Kennedy Administration for sanctioning attempts

against Fidel Castro's life by the Agency during that period and, also, in

formulating South American policy for his brother.

Second, we can prove that missile installations were being pre-

pared in Cuba as early as March 1961 prior to the Bay of Pigs, and that

missiles of the IRBM range were installed prior to the end of that year, i.e.,

1961, with the full knowledge of the Attorney General, Robert E. Kennedy,

and some select Senators.

Needless to say, if the information was passed on

from RFK to JFK, it must have put his brother the President in a rather awk-

ward position. At any rate, given the opportunity, we can provide foreign

government sources as well as Cuban underground sources to prove that the

missiles did exist in Cuba in 1961. I remembered it quite well and would also

be willing to testify to the Committee that such was the case. It first became

known to me in mid-1961, at the time I rented the house on 36th Street NW for

Mario Kohly SI.

If one analyzes the ramifications of this fact being kept secret by

the Administration, the missile crisis must have become a nightmare to the

Kennedys. The Russians finally flaunted their missiles in American faces in

October of 1962, knowing full well they would have to be discovered along with

the large number of their bomber aircraft being assembled in the open on

Cuban air fields. Faced with such a situation, the Kennedys were placed in

the position where they either had to invade the island risking an all out war

of, in effect, give up something. They chose to give up something. They

chose to allow Cuba to remain an independent state. This resulted in sup-

pressing the exile groups, while outwardly promising equipment and other

held. As you know, six major attempts were made on Fidel Castro's life,

all sanctioned or known about by our own agencies. Of course, none of

these attempts were successful. I feel we have the ability to show the Com-

mittee that the Attorney General, Robert E. Kennedy, instructed it to be

known to Fidel Castro every time one of these attempts was to be made.

•Third, it is my contention that the missiles were never physi-

cally removed from Cuba in 1962, but were taken back to previously prepared

sites, well camouflaged, well hidden, and out of the sight of either our U-2's

or low flying reconnaissance aircraft. Keeping this fact in mind, you can

readily see why the Kennedys under no circumstance could allow any exile

group to succeed in an invasion, or allow Fidel Castro to be assassinated,

thus providing the impetus for an internal take over by the underground. In

the event either occurred, the discovery that such installations still existed

intact would end the Kennedy Administration.

Faced with the dilemma of the underground continually telling

Kohly of the missiles' existence and the Kennedys still promising support ánd,

in fact, in some minor cases, giving it, Kohly managed to maintain a tight

reign on his organization, while being continually thwarted. This situation

came to a head on 1 October 1963. That's the date when the Administration

blew the counterfeiting operation that I personally conducted in Baltimore, and

was the last major shot the United Organizations had for recapturing their

homeland. This action on the Kennedys' part was completely unreal consi-

dering Maxwell Taylor, the CLA, and several high ranking people on the Hill

were completely appraised about what was going on.

By covering up the real facts behind the missile crisis, the

Kennedys were able to successfully maintain a strong political image; but, in

my opinion, it sealed JFK's death warrant.

Certain right wing radical groups associated with the Cuban

exiles and American mercenaries, such as the Minutemen in New Orleans

and Dallas, the Anti-Communist Brigade in Miami, as well as a myriad of

others knowing this information, were incensed

that the Kennedys, although

overtly seeming to support all types of small paramilitary operations, were

DocId: 32423486 Page 10

covertly suppressing them. It is my opinion, and there is evidence now

coming forth from other sources to bear me out, that one or more of

these groups decided to take it upon themselves to carry out JEK's assassi-

nation. The persons involved, the techniques, and other information which

can be made available to me, should more properly be described to Mr.

Miller as we discussed, rather than putting such information as to sources

in this document. It is also my opinion that it can now be readily proven

that the CIA knew of such intentions on the life of JFK and chose to ignore

the information. Likewise, it is my opinion that persons actually on the

Agency payroll were directly involved, but not in any sanctioned official

capacity.

It is my contention that the proof is there, both photographically

and by testimony of some of those people who are still alive who were

peripherally, but not not knowingly, involved in the conspiracy and subse-

quent cover-up. The proof is there to show why such a fateful decision was

made on the part of these dissident groups. The proof is there to show why

the Agency hierarchy could have felt that the Kennedys were jeopardizing

national security on the missile crisis and thus turned their backs. There is

also significant proof already starting to surface that other agencies were

also informed of impending plots against President Kennedy's life, and that

they also did not react to the extent they should have.

Given the cooperation of the Committee and the ability to work

with it, I feel that this information could be obtained swiftly and accurately,

along with a significant number of qualified witnesses of high integrity to

testify in support of the allegations made in this statement.

Awaiting your pleasure, I remain,

Sincerely yours,

7u-1h

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Request for Documents

Pertaining to Diving Suit for Castro; Request

Made During Breckinridge's Testimony of 3 June

1975

1. This memorandum is response to the Senate Select

Committee request of 3 June 1975 to Mr. Scott Breckinridge

for all documents pertaining to the procurement of a diving

suit for Castro and all material used to impregnate it.

2.

A search for records relating to

the procurement

of a diving suit or materials with which it might be treated

prior to delivery to Fidel Castro has produced no results.

Files relating to a CIA project which involved CIA access

to materials and techniques for special BW applications at

*ort Detrick do, however, reveal work with substances not

incompatible with the alleged diving suit ploy. There

were no indications, however, that they were actually used

in such a fashion.

Subject:

SSC Request to Breckinridge During his 2 June Appearance,

for Files and Materials relating to the 1967 IG Report on

Assassinations, Including Tab A after Page 77 of the Report.

Response:

A search has been made for the files of the Chief, WH

Division in 1967 (Desmond Fitzgerald), and those of Col.

J. C. King. At that time Mr. Fitzgerald was alive; he

has since died and his files do not exist as an integral

collection, although portions may exist in different

holdings in WH Division. Col. King had retired at the

time of the IG inquiry, but he was still working under a

special contract and was at the Headquarters Building

at Langley where he had retained some personal files;

his files are no longer identifiable.

Other materials, reviewed by the Inspectors in 1967 were

limited in nature, some of which have been made available

to SSC Staff members in envelopes in which they have been

held since 1967. The SSC Staff members have had access

to the project files of QJWIN, WIROGUE, ZRRIFLE and

EMDEED.

should they wish

access to the files relating to the anti-Diem coup, they

can be made available on request.

A review of Agency files reveal one instance, in

addition to the 1962 intercession in connection with

the Las vegas bugging incident, in which CIA

representatives approached law enforcement

authorities with reference to pending prosecution

against any of the above persons.

Records show that on 26 February 1971 the

Comnissioner, Inmigration and Naturalization Service,

Department of Justice, was approached concerning

action reportedly being initiated for the

deportation of John Roselli. The purpose of this was

to forestall public disclosure of Roselli's past

operational association with CIA. It was agreed that

CIA would be kept informed of the progress of all

action. No further commitments were made.
