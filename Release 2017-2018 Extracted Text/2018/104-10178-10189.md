1. A review of Subject’s 201 file (201-282538) reveals that many
reports emanating from [kovella Baséjare niscing or rather had never been
included in the file and that subsequent activities of’ his in Switzerland
and the United States had never been reported. oe

2. ‘The undersigned was directly involved with Subject's initial
refuge in Greece, as the undersigned vas fase Chie? at Kavallajat the tine
and participated in the interrogation of Subject and the others who defected.
with him due to the suspicious nature of their escape story. During later
: years, in the course of debriefing various contects and consultants, Subject's
name came up during these discussions and the undersigned was able: to piece
together the sequence of affairs from the time of RAIKIN's escape until the

present.

3. During the sumer of 1951, Subject,along with two other individuals
vho vere all frudovaxs working on airfields in Bulgaria, escaped to Greece.
In connection with their escape, four other individuals likewise escaped
to Greece. During Subject's interrogation and the interrogation of his
friends, it vas felt that the escape story needed clarification from a CE
standpoint. To the best of our ‘mowledge, however, none of the individuals,
including Subject,appeared to be connected with the BIS. There was a poss-
ibility vhich waa mentioned at the tine, that, Subject, due to his educational
background, may have been a “sleeper” type agent. During Subject's initial
interrogation he stated that politically he was partial to, although not a
member of, the Nikola Petkov faction (left wing) of the Agrarian party. It
was likewise determined that Subject's interest precluded operational use
as a cross border agent and neither he nor bis colleagues vere recruited.

‘The other four individuals who escaped separately to Greece were, hovever,
recruited.

4, Upon arrival in the DP camp in Athens (Lavrion) Subject becane
involved in political discussions and at that time claimed to be an adherent
of the Dimitur Gichev faction (righ: wing) of the Agrarian party, which nad
been outlawed upon the event of communism in Bulgaria. His political mach-
inations caused splitting of the refugees into vplinter groups and rather
than succeeding in effecting unity, it caused disunity. Again the thought
came up es to whether Subject was a provocation agent or not. However, no
evidence vas uncovered to substantiate this theory.

lengths to talk to each of the individuel Lulgarian And Necedonian
presidents in the various cities ant later on attempted to get thea to

Church in North America almost disintegrated as a cohesive unit. When

the matter finally cane to a vote and 1t developed Subject would not get
the Job, but would be offered a pricsthuod, he suddently decided, despite
the years and money spent on him by WCC in theological training, that he
did not want to be a priest anyway and, s few weeks later, turned around
and married a girl in-New York. This act, of course, prohibits him from
ever aspiring to be Bishop. Since that time on numerous occasions, Subject
using his offices in WCC as a cover, has sent Genunciatory letters con-
cerning other Bulgariens to various US Government agencies if these Bulg-
arians happened to have crossed bim or if he has taken a dislike to them.
By the same token, he has written letters concerning Bulgarians whom

he espouses to various agencies in order to obtain assistance in the grant~

ing of visas and of obtaining jobs.

9. The undersigned, like all other sources involved, cannot offer any
evidence that Subject 19 an agent of the Bulgarian Communist regime, but
feels thet his activities have certainly played into their hands and
have been such as they vould have conducted through a provocation or
sleeper type agent. To be frank, the undersigned fecls that perhaps
Subject ia an over ambitious, mercenary, megalomaniac, who is not content
unless he is stirring up things in whic). ta name will eppear in prominence

and from vhich he can derive some benefit.
