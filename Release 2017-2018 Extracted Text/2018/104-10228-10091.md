arce.

2. Also of interest in this connection fe the following additions}
information:

a. Col. Wendell U. Johnson, our coatact with Dr. Joe:
MIRO Cardona, hap been informed by MIRG'e secretary, Ascension
Cadavieco FEREZ, that twenty-one mombere of the Democratic
Chrtetian Movement went to the Caribbean Admission Center on

12 June 1962 to eniiet in the U. 5 Army at the office of tat Lt.
Fernando Ordas. They wero told, according to PEREZ, that

14, Urdas was no longer at the Caribbean Admiesion Center and

reply. On 15 June Mr. Robert A. Hurwitch of the Pepartment of
State telephoned Manuel Antonio de VARONA y Loredo to inquire
about this incident. VARONA was not familiar with the matter
and referred the query to DESFAIGNE, However, VARONA also
informed Col. Johnson, who telephoned Air, Hurwitch on 15 June
and explained the background. Nir. Hurwiteh told Col. Jahna
that he was concerned that too much talk by Cubans might
jeopardize the U. S. Army program now under consideration,

3. In commenting on the reports in the attached summary,

Col, Johnson stated that MIRC has been urging the Cuban exile
groups to encourage thelr men to enlist in the U. 5S, Army but
that the arguments reportedly used in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the
ettachment are completely contrary to the instructions he gave
MIRO. In MIRO's absence Col. Johneon discussed this matter

cwith VARONA, who denied that such argumonte are being used.
VARONA stated that his group (Movimiento de Rescate Constitu-
clonal Democratico) had decided six months ago to et in the
enforcement of the registration regulations of the Selective
Service Syetem and to encourage ite mambere to join the U. 5.
Army. VARONA further reported that thie program had not
gotten started until June but that he has a et of 600 membera,
18 to 36 years of age, who are potential military matertal.
According to VARONA, his group now plang to determine how
many of these have actually registered and/or enlisted.

4. Col, Johnson also commented that he had been informed
by the U. S. Army recruiting office in Miami that all aliens must
register aix months after arrival in the United Sates and that the
Selective Service System then assigns such registrante ty local
boards for classification and further action. From the informa-
tlon now available it is not clear whether the reported acciviti
of the Movimiento de Rescate Constitucional Democratico are in
Support of registration or actual enlistment.

5. As reflected by the information contained in Paragraph 2. a.
above, and in some of the reporte summarized in the attachment,
there is obviously misunderstanding within the Cuban community
concerning the existing policy on Cuban enlistments in the U. S.

SENSTTIVE

Army, Although it te understood that the program now being
considered for the future will not assure Cuban enlistees that j
they will not be sent outside the United 1 . both MIRO and i
Col. Johnson have understood that the exteting agreement ie

that Cubans who have already enlisted or who enlist before

3G June 1962 will not be sent outside the United States, There
is also some confusion about the language requiremente for
Cuban eall: s under the present program. In order to deal
with these questions, our representatives in Miami urgently
need clarification of the existing official policy on Cuban en-
Metmonts, both for those who have already enlisted and for
those who may callst before the new prograin Ja undertaken, !
It would also be of great assistance if you could provide infor-
ination on the new proposed program, I will appreciate it if
you will furnish this offlee with the above information and with
aa Indication of what portions of it we may pass on to MIRO for
hie guidance.
