Libero Mectardelli (Correct)
SUBJECT: US Repatriate, Libero Rickiardel (Rikkierdel), Needham
Heights 94, Massachusetts.

REF t Paragraph three, our Memo, dated 31 Jul 61, forwarded under
y Case - 35760. {copy attached )

1. After all this time, ve sinely {although inadvertently)
obtained the name of the gentleman referred to in the above reference;
the subject of this memo. \

2. Our source Aerospace Corporation,
recently received a exis G. Ivakhnenko s
that subject had returned to the Pir cht et Sah ed of es
letter, bad English and all: .
“It seems to me I speak vorser English than some times ago ~
especially after my neighbor Libero Rickierdel (Rikkiardel)
[the typing was hard to decipher because of strike-overs on
the second and third letters] went home for Needham Heits
94, Massachusetts. It was good praxis for me to speak with
him. He is complicated man having good and bad sides. Shortly
to tell, he ie rather egoistic man who did not think about
Communism er capitalism. Having the strong complications
in his family, he dos not love his wife but wanted the such
divorce when the children remain with his mother but not with
the wife, because he considers her as mentally weak. He hoped
to find the answer in another system. Here he received
rather good apartment and salary - 150 rubles per month, but
became homesick. Even the beautiful nature of Kiev seemed
to him gray and bore [varet]. With great difficulties,
mainly from the USA side, hi got permission to return to
home. There wait for him two big problems: first - to
solve the problem with wife and children. ‘the old fashioned
society of Needham will be against him. Second - the State
Department cannot ‘forgive’ him his cosmopolitical behavior.

“An& poor Norma [undoubfedly Libero's wife] has no meem to
live and cannot find the job in USA, even as the baby sitting
woman. She is very tired and almost 111. Her only sister
tells her the price of the meal which she eats. Libero is
rather stingy, as many people snbroad, except you, of course!
Her situation is very tregic.”

3. Earlier in the letter, Alexis asked write a welcoming
letter and maybe later visit with him. In t lexis said, “I
would like to know his destiny after return home.“ And later, he said,
“Do not ask a word about Norma from Libero, it makes him fierce. He really ot
: does not love her, Nevertheless I would like to know the future of this N
‘ family and maybe help them in any way - for instance I can try to send Ve
the medicine which Norma likes and. cannot find in the USA.”

: 4, Perhaps the Bureau would like’to have a next door neighbor's
contribution re a recent repatriate. If s0, please do not divulge our SY
source's name.

: 5. Too, Libero might be an excellent source of bio data on
' Ivakhnenko, having lived next door to him for a few years. With a
slight amount of pressure, he would probably be a most willing source.

6. With reference to ting to and visiting this
individual, we advised him til such time as we were
notified differently. Therefore, would you please check with the
appropriate Bureau staff to determine the extent of their interest and

whether or not our source would be cleared to write to and/or visit
him?

7. Please advise.
