to Chicago.

However,

ANDERSON said that MANNARINO did not make

any purchase from WOLF during that trip.

On February 27: 1958, a further inquiry concerning

the officers and directors of

the presumably defunct Uniteo

Dryer Corporation was made at Springfield by Chicago, which

has not received an answer to this inquiry as yeto

Dearborn, Chicago.

SCHWARTZ is a partner of the

Silverman Blumenthal and Schwartz.

Re United Dryer Company and

United Dryer Sales and Service Company

Chicago, illinois

On February 25, 1958, ARTHUR F. SCHWARIZ advised

that he had a former client by the name of OSCAR SCHULTZ,

whom he represented in the incorporation of a company called

United Dryer Sales and Service, Incorporated.

SCHWARTZ

advised that he was an incorporator of this company and also

had been Statutory Agent for 1t.

SCHWARTZ said that he had

represented OSCAR SCHULTZ; a man who owned a car wash and who

had also been in the coin

operated machine business for

some time before SCHULTZ wanted to incorporate in order to

handle the manufacture and sale of a small, hot air; drying

machine for use in washrooms, etc.

SCHWARIZ advised that he thought that ScHULTz had

hold of a good idea and that he would be producing a good

and saleable product in the 1952-1953 period..

SCHWARTZ said

he even got his partner, SILVERSTEIN, to agree to take their

fees in the form of stock in the corporation, but SCHuLTZ

would not agree to this SCHWARTZ advised it developed that

the product was not so good; in fact, the dryer would not work.

However, SCHWARIZ said that he had applied for and

obtained an Illinois Charter for the United Dryer Corporation

and

all he and his partner could manage to collect out of 1t

was that they got their corporation costs from SCHULTz, but

he refused to pay them their fee. SCHWARTZ pointed out that
