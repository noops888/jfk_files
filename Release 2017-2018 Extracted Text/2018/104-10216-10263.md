2. CUBA IS PACED WITH SERIOUS ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES: THE
COUNTRY HAS MANY PROBLEYS WHICH DEFY SOLUTION, BUT WHAT WORRIES
PIDEL CASTRO THE MOST IS THAT HE IS UNABLE TO SEE ANY SOLUTION TO
THE CRISIS, ALL ECONOMIC PLANS END IN FAILURE, CASTRO BLAMES THE
PERSONALITIES INVOLVED AND PUBLICLY CASTIGATES THEM, BUT HE REFUSES
TO BELIEVE THE SYSTEM IS WRONG, AS A RESULT, CASTRO ASSUMES PER-
SONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MORE PROGRAMS, FEWER PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO
ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLANNING, AND EVEN CASTRO IS UNABLE TO
DIRECT ALL THE PROGRAMS HE HAS UNDERTAKEN, i

2. CUBA REALIZES THAT THE USSR CANNOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ALL OP CUBA'S FOONOMIC NEEDS UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS, THERE-
FORE, CUBA HAS CHANGED HER FOREIGN COMMERCIAL POLICY AND IS NOW
1 PLACING INCREASED EMPHASIS ON TRADE WITH NON-BLOC COUNTRIES,
INITIALLY, WHEN CUBA HAD AMPLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, THE POLICY OF IN-
{ CREASING TRADE WITH NON-BLOC COUNTRIES SHOWED SOME PROMISE, BUT

WITH INADEQUATE EXCHANGE FACILITIES, AS AT PRESENT, CUBA IS UNABLE aes

I TO MEET TERMS oF EXISTING COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS AND 1S FINDING IT

: DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE NEW AGREEMENTS, THE FEW AGREEMENTS WHICH
HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED CONTAIN TERMS UNPAVORABLE TO CUBA,

: 3. CUBA'S ECONCMIC-COMMERCIAL DILEMMA IS THE PRIMARY REASON
WHY CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO bleed ANTONIO CARRILLO CARRERAS RETURNED
TO HAVANA ON 1 DECEMBER, (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: SEE TDCS~314/06460-
64.) PIERRE NIETO, FRENCH BUSINESSMAN WHO IS-IN HAVANA, IS PROPOS-
ING A SIXTY-MILLION-DOLLAR TRADE PACKAGE FOR WHICH NIETO CLAIMS HE
CAN ARRANGE FRENCH FINANCING, THIS IS ONE OF THE SPECIFICS WHICH
CARRILLO, WHO DISLIKES NIETO, IS DISCUSSING WITH FIDEL CASTRO AND
ERNESTO "CHE" GUEVARA, (F1ELD COMMENT: SOURCE, WHO LEFT HAVANA IN
EARLY NOVEMBER 1964, NOTED THAT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE
TEERE WAS A DISTINCT CHANGE IN THE ATTITUDE OF HIGH CUBAN OFFICIALS
WITH RESPECT TO THS UNITZD STATES, ON THE BASIS OF CONVERSATIONS
WITH OFFICIALS CLOSE TO FIDEL CASTRO, WHOM SOURCE DID NOT IDENTIFY,
SOURCE BECAME CONVINCED THAT CASTRO IS WILLING TO ENTER INTO COM-

; MERCIAL DIALOGUE WITH TEE UNITED STATES AND IS SEARCHING FOR

OPENINGS To DO so.)

CUSSING THE POSSIBILITY OF REMOYING HIM FROM POWER, (SOURCE COMMENT:
