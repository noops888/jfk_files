• AND

APPRAISAL: A FORMER HIGH-LEVEL CUBAN OFFICIAL WHO WAS ONCE ACTIVE IN THE

REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT AND A CONFIDANT OF FIDEL CASTRO. HE HAS

ALWAYS BEEN ANTI-CONSUNIST AND IS NOW STRONGLY ANTI-CASTRO.

HE

CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH MANY CUBAN OFFICIALS AT ALL

LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

SOURCE HAS PROVIDED A LIMITED NUMBER OF

REPORTS WHICH APFEAR TO HAVE BEEN ACCURATE.

-

1. CUBA IS PACED WITH SERIOUS ECONONIC DIFFICULTIES: THE

COUNTRY HAS MANY PROBLEMS WHICH DEFY SOLUTION, BUT WHAT WORRIES

FIDEL CASTRO THE MOST IS THAT HE IS UNABLE TO SEE ANY SOLUTION TO

THE CRISIS. ALL ECONONIC PLANS END IN FAILURE. CASTRO BLAMES THE

PERSONALITIES INVOLVED AND PUBLICLY CASTICATES THESI, BUT HE REFUSES

TO BELIEVE THE SISTEN IS WRONG. AS A RESULI, CASTRO ASSUMES PER-

SONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MORE PROGRAMS, FEWER PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO

ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLANNING, AND EVEN CASTRO IS UNABLE TO

DIRECT ALL THE PROGRAMS HE HAS UNDERTAKEN.

2. CUBA REALIZES THAT THE USSR CANNOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY

FOR ALL OF CUBA'S SCONOYIC NEEDS UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS. THERE-

FORE, CUBA HAS CHANGED HER FOREIGY COUMERCIAL POLICY AND IS NOW

PLACING INCREASED EMPHASIS ON TRADE WITH NON-BLOC COUNTRIES.

INITIALLY, WHEN CUBA HAD AMPLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, THE POLICY OF IN-

CREASING TRADE WITH NON-BLOC COUNTRIES SHOWED SOME PROMISE, BUT

WITH INADEQUATE EXCHANGE FACILITIES, AS AT PRESENT,, CUBA IS UNABLE

TO MEET TERS OF EXISTING CONMERCIAL AGREEMENTS AND IS FINDING IT

DIFFICULT TO NEGOTIATE NEW AGREEMENTS. THE FEW AGREEMENTS WHICH

HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED CONTAIN TERMS UNPAVORABLE TO CUBA.

• 3. CUBA'S ECONCHIC-CONMERCIAL DILEMMA IS THE PRIMARY REASON

WHY CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE ANTONIO CARRILLO CARRERAS RETURNED

TO HAVANA ON 1 DECEMBER. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: SEE TDCS-314/06460-

64.) PIERRE NIETO, FRENCH BUSINESSHAN WHO IS IN HAVANA, IS PROPOS-

ING A SIXTY-MILLION-DOLLAR TRADS PACKAGE FOR WHICH NIETO CLAIMS HE

CAN ARRANGE FRENCH FINANCING. THIS IS ONE OF THE SPECIFICS WHICH

CARRILLO, WHO DISLIKES NIETO, IS DISCUSSING WITH FIDEL CASTRO AND

ERNESTO "CHE" CUEVARA, (FIELD COSMENT: SOURCE, WHO LEFT HAVANA IN

EARLY NOVESBER 1964, NOTED THAT A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE

TERS WAS A DISTINCT CHANGE IN THE ATTITUDE OF HIGH CUBAN OFFICIALS

WIFE RESPECT TO THS UNITED STATES. ON THE BASIS OF CONVERSATIONS

WITH OFFICIALS CLOSE TO FIDEL CASTRO, NEOM SOURCE DID NOT IDENTIFY,

SOURCE BECAME CONVINCED THAT CASTRO IS WILLING TO ENTER INTO COM-

• MERCIAL DIALOGUS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND IS SEARCHING FOR

OPEÑINGS TO DO SO.)

1. BECAUSE CASTRO IS ASSUMING PERSONAL RESPOSSIBILITY FOR

BLANTY OF CUBA'S ECONGNIC PROGRAYS AND IS ALSO FAILING, MORE PEOPLE

ARE BSGINNING TO CRITICIZE HIM, ALTHOUCH SUT TO THE EXTENT OF DIS-

CUSSING TRE POSSIBILITY OF REXOTISE HIM FROM POWER, (SOURCE COMMENT:
