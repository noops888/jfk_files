COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH RIVAS HAS, ON OCCASION, HANDLEDS

SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AN

ASSIGNMENT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT IS UNUSUAL. IT IS OUT OF

CHARACTER FOR PEREZ TO EXPLAIN OR APOLOGIZE FOR HIS ACTIONS AND

IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT A PEREZ REPRESENTATIVE WOULD ADMIT THAT

BOSCH HAS POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WHEN THE

GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TO GREAT LENOTHS TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE THIS FACT.)
