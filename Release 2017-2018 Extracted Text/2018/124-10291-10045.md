CHILE'S FORMAL WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PACT ON 30 OCTOBER.)

6. | IN REQUESTING HIS MEETING WITH LEIGH, RIVAS ASKED
THAT HIS PRESENCE IN CHILE NOT BE MADE A MATTER OF PUBLIC
KNOWLEDGE. FOR THIS REASON, THE MEETING WAS ARRANGED TO TAKE
PLACE. IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE RATHER THAN AT DIEGO PORTALES
GOVERNMENT HOUSE, WHERE THERE iS A GREATER RISK OF DISCOVERY BY

REPORTERS:

7. . (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: A REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS AGENCY

{COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH RIVAS HAS, ON OCCASION, HANDLEDG)
SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AN

ASSIGNMENT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT IS UNUSUAL. IT IS OUT OF

CHARACTER FOR PEREZ TO EXPLAIN OR APOLOGIZE FOR HIS ACTIONS AND -
IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT A PEREZ REPRESENTATIVE WOULD ADMIT THAT.
BOSCH HAS POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WHEN THE
GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE THIS FACT.)
