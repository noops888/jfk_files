SUBJECT General : Debfiefing of AMMUG-1 |

REFERENCE : Sk Blind Miémorandam dated 05 May 1984 v i
Memorandum dated 07 May 1964 |

‘onversations between CI Staff and I

C/WH/SA/CI |

1. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the !
specific questions prepared by CI Staff were posed. The answers
given by the Source were reported.in Reference A. That memorandum
which I dictated to a Cl Staff stenographer appears accurate except for
sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"
known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, ona i
television program, of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2, On 07 and 08 May 19641 further discussed the Oswald Case
with the Source in order to clarify exactly what he knew and what
he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe
that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached if I
record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.
Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the
information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and
comments. Ne

" J have no personal Imowledgeo 6 Harvey OSWALD or his
activities and I do not know that-OSWALD was an agent of the
Direccion General de Inteligencia (BGI) or any other directorate
or department of the Cuban, Government.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously had
been assigned to Mexico-in.te Cuban\Consulate where he
was the principal intelligence officer of the DGI. VEGA
mentioned that OSWAED had\gone’ to the Cuban Consulate
two or three tfiues'in connection with a visa application
during the timevthat VEGA,w as in Mexico. I gathered, i
although I do not know that VEGA made any specific
statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen H
OSWALD, I well could have reached this conclusion i
because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for H
the DGI, Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons |
applying for a visa to go to Cuba, This is because DGI
officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas
of agents of the DGI. Such agentston appearing at the al
Consulate use a special phrase(to inslicate their relationship \
with the DGI, (1 do not know the: particular phrase used .
in every case. I do knowthat agenta from El Salvador in
requesting visas alway& made mention of the name "Mauricio" )
The DGI officers at@ Consulate interview visa applicants to
dind out if they gents, If the Visa applicant does not use

one of the inc ‘phrases, the DGI officers instead of
granting the yagdiately, tell the applicant to return in

afew days. The offiger\flien notifies Habana and requests
authority for the visa. YI cannot recall if VEGA even made the
statement that he had requested permission to issue a visa to
OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because
‘VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and
this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez also would have
seen OSWALD because he wor,

‘ieiAwith VEGA and also would
have screened visa applicantss_“S>

instructed either to remain in the DGI Headquarters offices
or to keep the DGI aware of their whereabouts so that they
could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for
these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued W
because of the possibility that the United State might take
some type of action against Cuba and the DGI offices. As

B. When the news that OSWALD was the assassin reached

Commission or any lawyer serving on the Warren Commission
staff that such plans had been underway? If the answer is
yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the
Agency delivered said information, to whom it was delivered,

the Warren Commissigns\If the Commission was not told about
this, why was it not. ‘4 and who made the.decision not to
deliver such information to the Warren Commission?

2. There is evidence FN Castro, prior to November 22, 1963,

that the <0 as received a telephone call from RANKIN
regarding the Gommission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,
Thursday. Mr. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that
morning.

2. The DDP wishes to have from you a short but
comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or
positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the
Commission. For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission
would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to How improvements
might be made in protecting the President's life.’ Further, they
will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities: that.a con-
spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates
that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

ON interviews. I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent
3 information which you are processing which originated with the

RS —\’ sensitive WH source. I informed him that in your view this would
raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should
not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless
we have first had ‘some preliminary reaction or made sure that the
Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve
as the basis for detailed questioning. The DDP stated that he would
review this’ carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3. Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a-paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

‘The Commission's major problem has been the assessment
of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to
possible conspiratorial guidance, Because conspiracy is the
core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of
legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing
recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating, There
is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in
advance information relating to’ Presidential security and the
problem faced by the countiy a few years ago regarding the
clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U,S, of special
nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that
time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955
(29 Stat 365, PL.165, 84th Congress), In essence, the Act estab-
lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

‘The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action,
‘The reward would constitute additional inducement for such
individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

reward and special treatment. The DCI can assure the Com~

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive, 5] The DCI could also
indicate that the Commission might desize to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,
Fidel CASTRO appeared at_a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press saa

paniel BA HARKER.
—_—_—__—_—_—

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on
Monday, 9 September. ‘There.can be.no question from the
facts surrounding the CASTRO* appdarance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented_a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

SS omen

cried in extracting Massie atin - |
(" ... KENNEDY is " ... the BATISTA of his
times ... the most opportunistic American President of
all time ...").
4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary
reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing
the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in
| the xeplay by United States newspapers like the
New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that
CASTRO's "message" was. significantly modulated. >
5. In New. Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the niddie“of “Séptember 1963, the HARKER story
appeared in the principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune,
on Monday, 9 Sentember,—page~#, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders
Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the
HARKER by-line: :
"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister
Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.s.
leaders would be in danger if they helped
in any attempt to do away with leaders of”

Cuba.'

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

to the effect that the OSWALD family traveled from Moscow to

Chief, SR
. \
_ €LA Work-in Support of the Warren Commission .

Below is-x’ summary of the matters discussed in our
Qoetate with Messrs. Angleton and Rocca on the evening of

5 ganuaryr964. In turn, Ue, Angleton was reporting taus
the ‘substance of his meeting with Mir. Allen Dulles, ur.

J. Lée Rankin, Chief Counsel, Ur. Wellins of the Justice-~
Department, Mr. Helms and ars Rocca, which took place on the
afternoon of 14 January 1964.

2. Mr, Angleton said that Ur. Dyifgs, apparently pro-
voked by press accusations that the ¥: Commission has
been dilatory, asked CIA
requests to be aK

eanisbion nsdUis be treaemiteea ;
through the Department of State, would seek additional evi- i
dence which is presumably available in Soviet files which i
could assist the Commission's deliberations. Ur. Dulles did
not have a detailed idea of what he wanted to ask the Soviets {;
for but did say that the questions should be "not too tech- q
nical." Although Mr. Angleton thought that the letter should ©
be written only after the CIA report and comments have been t
completed, in order to make the letter as effective as possi-
ble, tir. Dulles felt it should go now, be phrased in generali-
ties and allow the Soviets more flexibility im their handling |
of the matter than would a more pointed letter based on our
concrete findings. Hr. Dulles asked CIA only for the questions
and not for a draft letter. Hr. Murphy suggested that we ask «< |
only for certain records rather than put specizic questions t
i

to the Soviets. Ur. Murphy suggested that these night include
Soviet kospital records connected with Lee Oswald's attempted
suicide, city visa and registration records for Moscow and
\Yinsk, factory personnel records from Oswald's place of employ~ i
nent, etc. ~AIso Oswald's diary noted that bis case had passed i
‘through two commissions in the USSR; we might ask for the i
‘records of these commissions as well. Mr. Angleton said that 7 f
in transmitting our suggestions to Mr. Dulles we can include

thinking about these proposals.

4. Mr. Rankin said that the Commission has a waist-high
stack of documents and reports received from the FBI and Secret
Service which CIA has ‘not yet received. These include Secret
Service interviews with Marina Oswald, letters from-Lee Oswald
in the USSR and other materinl. He promised to send this
material to Hr. Helms shortly.

material to DERYABIN for further analy~

BIN's paper be recast into more of a questionnaire form and.
Mr. Bagley agreed, pointing out that DERYABIN'’s comment and
speculation could be put off to the side as explanatory con
ment on erch question, as appropriate. Mr. Angleton and Ur. |
Murphy thought that it would be desirable to send this paper i
to the Warren Commission in advance of other CIA reports with H
a memorandum informing the Commission that we would need vot
answers to this interim questionnaire in order to reconstruct :
a detailed chronology of Oswald's time in the USSR and to ;
comment on his activity there. The Commission would be asked

to procure the information from Marina through any Agency it

might choose.

6. Hr. Angleton reported that he had asked the Commis—
sioa representatives certain questions pertaining to our use
of defectors #8 onalysing the Oswald papers:

<a, Was ‘the Commission formally requesting us to
hive Smee analyse the material?

So BL Yellin thought that the answer
Vw Sto ‘this question is yes. However,
Mr. Angleton asked for a formal
request from the Commission to this
. effect. The FBI. has stated that its
reports are not to be passed to a
AELADLE, which may cause some compili-~
cations. ~
b. Would the Commission be-piepared to- assume the
burden of responsibility if such:a defector should disa-
gree with the Commission's opinige’ ordome.up with a
radically different hypothesis or 1: Gerpretation?

‘The persons present said that the
Commission would.

c. If a defector who had contributed to the analy—
sis of the documents should be unwilling to appear person—
ally and formally before the Commission, would the
Commission exercise its subpoena powers against hin?

Mr. Rankin thought that if there was
a xisk involved for the defector, the
Commission would not do so. However,
Rankin promised to get a formal answer
from the Commission on this point.

da. Will the classification we put on our corres=
pondence to the: Commission be honored?

The: answer was that in principle our
classification. would be honored. How=

6. Mr. Angleton reported that lr. Richard Davis is repre—
senting the interests of the Department of State in this
inquiry. Mr. Thompson had ruled himself out because he was
Ambassador to the Soyiet Union at the time of the events in

7, "One matter which bod been brought to light by the
Oswald 'case was the need for a mechanism in the United States
Government to record’ and assimilate our knowledge of the Soviet I:
handling of American defectors to the USSR. The Bureau is i
apparentiy im some danger of criticism for its failure to keep } i
an ora on wald after his return. Similarly CIA has not | i

2:

syst cally collected nor compiled information on Soviet
defector handling. Berlin Base had kept a list of American [
defectors at one time, but these individuals have not been
debriefed on their return to the West.

8, The Commission representatives at the 14 January 1964
meeting estimated that the Warren Commission would need from
three to six months to complete its task.

9. Mx. Bagley raised the question of the desirability
of having DSRYABIN participate personally, representing the
FBI as en interpreter perhaps, in a debriefing of Marina.
|Wesars. Angleton and Murphy were convinced that CIA must avoid
direct involvement with this investigation. Although it is
;less efficient as a method, we will content, oueseives with
‘putting written questions to Marina to be y whatever
Agency the Commission may choose to use. :
