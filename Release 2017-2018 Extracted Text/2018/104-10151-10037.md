4. The point of thee%érenced memorandum is that”
consideration should be given now to "whether or not the
entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time." This
submission is designed to make it possible for you, the
IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this
decision. The narrative-interpretive summary has been
“put together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms,
pseudonyms or other CIA jargon. However, its contents qo
well beyond what has been released to the public thus far
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must
be borne in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's
question. To xemove any question in anybody's mind about
our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up
by copies of actual documentation from our files. It
seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or
his representative review the documentation that backs up
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-
cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: There

7. ‘It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on
whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this
time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must
also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up
the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to
publish the entire run of the photographs for the first
time without taking out the background. Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material
to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself. I
think they should see the entire documentation as it
stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what could
be discussed and the question of "how?" and "how much?"
could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation is that the more we can say about this
matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding
that there are still sensitivé aspects deriving from the
fact that the operation which produced the photographs

was jointly with Mexican lia} and as a consequence
publication at this time would /€e additional problems
at that level in Mexico. Ali S“should be noted that

3. Under the “¢ tA effort to develop information
on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photograph were

22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,

an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval
Attaché to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing
investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was shown to

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follow-

of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to
the Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of
the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were
concerned with whether any reply had been received fron Washington.

22. Although the reaction of the Headquarters desk was "by the

b. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: “PUSAKOVA” for PRUSAKOVA.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters communications throughout the month). More important was:

c. Paragraph: (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with
a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual
observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to
Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,
“appeared to be an Anerican," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

There can be no question that this misreadii the Mexico Station report
was an analyst's error which escaped de ‘in the coordination before
release: the descriptive details **e y D were so far off the

keep these two matters apart as investigative facts. But things did not

work out that way.

39, With this conmunication the matter of the "unidentified

conviction, at first latent, then expressed, that the photographed
