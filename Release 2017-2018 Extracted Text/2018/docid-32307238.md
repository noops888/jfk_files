the effect that no gambling other than the regular pari-mutual betting will

be allowed on the property,

CELLINI said that the setting up of the

operation is stymied at the present. He explained that the owners of the

dog track property also own the casino Nacional which they hope to rent

at to some one for the coming winter season.
