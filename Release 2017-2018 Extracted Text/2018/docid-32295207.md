was the case.

It apparently is.

Miami recommends discontinuing

Before reaching definite conclusion

with Customs as to wholl should

in view of the possibility subjects are in violation of Federal laws

relative to neutrality matters that appropriate investigation was bej.

On July 1, 1965, U.S. Customs, Miami, advised

that sources and informants developed in

the case "ROBERTO

ALEJOS ARZU, IS - GUATEMALA; NEUTRALITY MATTERS," Bufile

2-1901, are also involved in this matter and started

reporting information concerning HEMMING's plans as soon

as the information was developed by other agencies.

No

formal complaint, as such, was received by Customs:

The

information was developed

from contacts with established

sources.

The basis for Customs? investigation is to

ascertain if arms or articles of war may be illegally

exported from the United States.

Customs stated that their inquiry to date

7/22/65

ref

and

mation developed by Customs is nothing that would

i ricantly affect investigation being conducted by

-TACB, the Miami Office plans no further active

investigation but will follow this matter through

MM 639-S, who is in constant and daily contact with

HEMMING.

The Bureau will be kept advised and the infor-

mation will besreported in form suitable for dissemination..
