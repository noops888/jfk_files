been no ‘action. In the yoar that has passed this promotion
has, becomo even more deserved, for despite tho natural dis~
Appointniont accompanying Such a continuing lack of recogni-
tion, thero has been no diminution of entliusiasm, no lowering.
of standards, and the CS is clearly better. managed because
of his continuing efforts. Were these two previous recommen-
dations ‘not so clear,cut and descriptive, I would conclude
that thoso in control simply do not know what this officer
dows. and has done. Knowing what he does and how he does it
should not continue to be unrewarded and, lence, I add my

I thought that froma broad, general standpoint the orientation wae worthwhile

There was too much of "we think this 1s what BOB meana" and too little of _
BOB saying ‘thia ia what we mean", J found the movie presentation of Dr, Ey
S. Quade's apeech-terrible because of inept projection, faulty audio equipment,
and out-of-place music. Dr. Quade had a message and fortunately the CSC
