And yet, 1 find in February 1971 there has still

thore has boon no diminution of entliuslasm, no lowcring

Were these two previous recommen

cut and descriptive, I would conclude

that thoso in control simply do not know

what this officer

does and has done.

Knowing what he does and how he dous it

should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, 1 add my

strongest recommondation for carly and favorable action.
