Mr. Smothers. Mr. Secretary, we see there a series of
lettered subparagraphs setting out alternatives that the CIA
has offered up as potential areas to be pursued, and then
some handwritten notes opposite each paragraph apparently in-
dicating approval or disapproval of the proposed faction.

The Chairman. Is this memorandum a:CIA memorandum?

Mr. Smothers. It is for the Chief of the Western Hemi-
sphere Division.

Senator Tower. But who signed off on it? That sig-

|
nature is obscured. |

Mr. Smothers. The author of this working paper is
unknown. It appears to be -- we have an acting chief -- VY) (A-

ae
i:Mr. Dennin. The chief at that time was b and

though it is not established, people have said that they

believed that it was Mr. Esterline who was the acting chief
at that date.

Mr. Smothers. Looking at that memorandum and coming
down to subparagraph C under paragraph 1 of the memorandum, we
see the statement:

"To what extent will the U.S. Government participate
in the overthrow of Trujillo".

And then in subparagraph C:

“Would ..it'. provide a small number of sniper rifles
or other devices for the removal of key Trujillo people from

the scene?"

Mr. Schwarz. Now if I might put this document in
chronological context for the Committee, the persons in Santo
Domingo are at this point seeking permission to pass machine
guns to the dissidents who they know are seeking those machine
guns in order to assassinate Trujillo, and there is a block
put on this shipment -- rather, to the passage of them; they
had already been shipped to the Dominican Republic -- and a
draft cable was prepared authorizing the passage and then it
was said, no, we've got to go check with State to determine
whether the machine guns should be passed.

And this memorandum reflects the checking with State, he
apparently came to see Mr. Berle..

Further, as a matter of information, thegagy who (/
was referred to in here, did know that other assassination
weapons had been passed to the dissidents.

Now given that background, I will read the memorandum
into the record and I will have one question for the witness. (i

anything to do with any assassination plots, anywhere, anytime.

Jsaia he felt the same way."

Now, Mr. Secretary, in the way which your understanding wag

of the expected degree of candor between CIA and the State

Department, would it be your expectation that if Pits |

had known that other weapons had been passed to the same

dissidents and they had stated that they intended to use those

other weapons to assassinate Mr. Trujillo, that pg

should have passed that information on to Mr. Berle?

Mr. Rusk. Under those circumstances, I would think the
answer is yes.

I mean, one thing I'm sure of, Mr. Schwarz, and that is
Mr. Berle did not write this memorandum on May 3rd, 1961 in
preparation for a Senate investigation in 1975.

Mr. Schwarz. You believe it to reflect accurately what
transpired?

Mr. Rusk. I have no douht. It was sent to Mr. Coerr, Mr.
Owen, Mr. Devine, in the Department of State, and I've known
Mr. Berle for quite a long time and I would have predicted this
would have been his reaction.

Senator Mathias. Mr. Chairman, just at this point --

The Chairman. Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias. It would be interesting to get the
Secretary's reflection that if that is the case, as Mr. Berle's

Memorandum indicates and as the Secretary said, how do you in
