weapon, motor, etc. is most difficult for him. On certain test problems of this
type, he froze completely, ani deteriorated to aimless movements. His memory
of numbers and recall of designs which he was required to draw were poor com-.
pared to his other abilities. However, he appears capable of relating a clear, _
logical sequence of events. .

All in all, this individual does not have mech leadership potential in terms
of experience, self-confidence ani drive; he needs strong guidance, He feels he
muist.do something and is pushing himself to volunteer provided he can get re-
assurance that hie job is part of a bigger plan. Although he is sincere and
basically a bright person, his performance is apt to vary a good deal and at
times become confused and almost immobile.
