making arrangeucnts for the trip of President Kennedy to Kexico from 2° June
to 1 July and at the time of the cuban crisis in October 1952. The Chief of
Station was given permission to sive a spociel dricf-

hin. In view of :oxico's important position in the "neutralist_non-inter-

vention" camp of Latin American countries, the ready access to
throuzh the G03 vho has built up an excellent rapport, is an

invaluable asset for ODYOKE policy makers. The present Ainbassador has shosin
to use this channel on several occasions.

he has asked for special briefings, and one such report on the India-Rcd

h. The joint tap center which provides coverage of 30 lines, is one of
the most important sources of positive intelligence and CI information for
iiexico. The 3tation is provided with the take fron these lines on a daily
vasis. There is a KUBARK Staff Agent, Arnold F. AREHART (ps), “ho sponds

full tive in the LP, and is responsible for complete raintenance of all the

i

equipment and for controlling KUBARK interests in this phase of the Project.

5. With rocard to events which might be considercd as bearing on the
sesurity of this project, the Station reported that on 15 June 1902, at
approximately 0930, the concierge noticed tro men standing directly across
the street from the LF and who seancd to have an unusual interest in the
activity of the LF. After avcut an hour both got in an automobile and con-
tinued to vatch the building from the car, and from time to time appeared

>to be baking notes on the comings and goings of the installations, as vel].

as making notes on the cars used by the personnel of the LF. They attempted
to follow one LF employee when he left for lunch. Later that day, LIENVOY-2
and LIENVOY-1 approached one of the two surveillance men and asked for an
explanation of his action that day, They also asked him to identify himself.
He. showed them a driver's license with the name Mariano VERA Gonzalez. This
information vas checked at the Department of Traffic and found to be the
license of anothcr person. The Traffic Department was staked out to deter-
mine vho, if anyone, might show an interest in the names and addresses of
the cars used by LP personnel. On the 16th of June, an agent of. the Secret
Service of the Folice Headquarters showed up and tried to obtain information
about the ower of the license plates on LIENVOY-2's car. The stake-out
employee and Secret’ Service man checked the traffic files, but the information
was not there. In conversation with the Secret Service man, information vas
gained which led the Station to suspect that he was a member of an investi-
gative group headed by a Mexican whose aim is to obtain political information
for Mexican politicians. Since the 15th, no further attempts to place the
LP under observation have been noted. Any problems such as this can be
handled, if necessary, by. the COS and his government contacts since this is

a joint venture.

6. During the past project year, there have been 236 disseminations
based on LIENVOY and LIENVOY-2 information: — 200 from the former and 36
from the latter. LIENVOY reporting covered such topics as:

a, Activities of Nexican leftists such as[ Sid

b. World Pea@e Council.
ec. Soviet and Czech activities in Mexico.
da. Activities of Soviet and Czech officials in Hexico.

e. National Liberation Movement (MIN).

j. Clandestine Communist propaganda and periodicals.

k. Coverage of activity in Mexico of interest to KUBARK in
connection with the trip of President Kennedy.

a. Communist Party activities in Mexico.

b. Anti-government propaganda and activity.

¢. National Liberation Movement.

d. Anti-U.5. activity in the National University.

e. Developments in Mexico of interest regarding the trip of

7. WH Division supports the attached renewal request for Project
LIENVOY submitted by the Mexico City Station. This project is considered
one of the Station's most productive sources of positive, operational and
CI information. Also, it provides a @landesting

for both the Station and the Ambassador.

REQUEST FOR PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A, Current Objectives,

The objectives of this project remain the same as those stated in
the last renewal request, The project continues to provide the Mexico
Station with a smooth and rapid channel to
figures The Principal Agent continues to be a close associate of|
= :

. The intercept center has undergone no major changes during
past year,

1. RMDM-6 Objectives Priority A, 1. a; Priority A, 4, a, b, ¢;

and Priority B, 2 and 3 continue to be effectively covered by this
project, Cordial and friendly relations continue between
and the Chief of Station, Mexico,
ring the past year, the ef of Station, Mexico, at the
request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico, has held a number of covert
meetings with © convey ODYOKE policy matters. The

Chief, ODACID, remains pleased with this access td

2, All Soviet and Czechoslovak ~ installations in
Mexico City are covered by this project, The Case Officer’

for Soviet Operations and the Case Officer for Soviet Satellite
Operations rely heavily on this product for operational leads
and data to support double agent operations,

3, All major anti-PBPRIME. elements in Mexico City are
covered by this project. :

4, Targets of opportunity which appear to be hostile or
eritical to PBPRIME or to the present Government of Mexico are
covered by this project,

All major objectives of the project are being effectively realized,
B. Changes.

At a yet to be determined date, it is planned to move the intercept
center from its present location. Two reasons are behind this move:
1) security, since the present base has been used for almost three years:
and 2) to provide the center with more mobile equipment. Such equipment
is now under consideration by KURIOT and when it becomes available, an
amendment to this project will be forwarded requesting approval for the
transfer of the intercept center,

Cc, Intelligence Production.

The activities report forwarded to Headquarters each month lists
the intelligence reports received from this project, During 1962 there
were 534 intelligence reports produced by this project which were
forwarded to Headquarters through.1 December 1962, All of these
concerned RMDM-6 reporting priorities and current requirements levied
by Headquarters and the ODACID installation,

‘In addition, this project produces a large amount of information
which is not disseminated on a current basis but is reported to ODACID,
ODENVY and other ODYOKE agencies in reply. to a steady stream of routine
file trace requests. These file trace requests run into the thousands
each month, It would be difficult to determine the exact percentage of
the information produced by LIENVOY; but in. many instances involving
prominent Mexican Government officials, large portions of the file came
to us through LIENVOY coverage,

D. Effectiveness.

The: LIENVOY project provides the Station with a channel to the

hhich is both effective and
rapid as well as covert. The Station continues to receive the daily
"resumen" highlights from the thirty (30) lines covered, A high
percentage of current intelligence is disseminated from these daily
re@orts, In addition, full transcripts are received on Soviet and
Czech lines and on any of the thirty targets we may request. A good
part of this is personality data useful only to KUBARK and in some cases
to ODENVY. In addition, the project provides a support mechanism for
covering targets of interest to KUBARK or other ODYOKE agencies,

E, Problems,

There have been no significant security, cover, control or liaison
problems during the past year,

F, Liaison.
From a liaison point of view, the Station believes that this project

contributes rreatly to the present friendly attitude of the Mexican
Government leaders toward ODYOKE policies, ‘Ihe liaison renains

are usually made at the request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico,

J. Annex,

The equipment and Headquarters technical support furnished this
project during the past year has been commendable. A project amendment
will be submitted requesting additional equipment for the transfer of
the intercept center as soon as modifications. and estimates are known.

K, Emergency Conditions,

Should a crisis require the evacuation of the KUBARK staff agent
working inside the Intercept Center, contact can be maintained with
LIELEGANT at his clandestine apartment, This address is retained at
the Mexico Station, If the contact is not made by Willard C, CURTIS,
the use of his name should be sufficient introduction, LIENVOY/2 could
be contacted in the same manner at his home in Mexico City,
