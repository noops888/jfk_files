This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal

Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's

desire that the FBI remain Jn

Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn doe

tha;

informants over to the Agency,

In accordance with the desire of the President and

recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special

Assistart to the fresident, thai tue fod renain in the Dominican,

Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House

that our

Staff in Santo Domingo would be reduced to three men

and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner

12/14

similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not

be an operational office but rather will serve as a strategic

listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with

agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies

of foreign governments in that country.

Memorandum V. R. Wannall to W. C. Sullivan

Re:

OPERATIONS

LIGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested

the New York Office might have use of informant's services.

This information furnished to New York Office which replied

that in the absense of organized activity informant would be

of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from

Dominican connunist groups to reorganize activity. This,

of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation

to turn

even though

both of these sources are In a position to furmish valuable

intelligence information to us.

By making these informants

available

we will avoid any possible duplication

or conflict.

This matter should be aiscussed with, appropriate

ofticials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency.

1s fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.

ACTION:

4097009989

If you approve:

(1) Liaison Agent will advise appropriate CIA

In accordance with the desire of the President that

the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic, we are setting up a

regular Legal Attache Office in Santo Domingo consisting of

three men•

will not be an operational office but rather

will serve as a strategic listening post for intelligence data

and as Ilaison with'agencies of the Dominican Republic, as

well as.other.agencies of foreign. governments..in that .country.

In connection with this reorganization, we have instructed our

representative in Santo Domingo
