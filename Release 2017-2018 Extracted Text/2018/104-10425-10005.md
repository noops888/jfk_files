We don't have to do research and
create a document for this requester.
Is such a "list" in existence?

I questioned Scott Breckinridge
about it. He said that the IG

Staf£ did not have a list, and

he doubted wheather CL Ops did.

(FYI: D'Unger has requested

Warren Commission documents from
NARS. WARS has steered him toward
the Agency re a couple of classified
items, so we can expect other re-

quests.)
