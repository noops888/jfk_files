FERED MsMorandum of Conversation, Dan
< soEather/les Midgley and the DCI,
LS Dated 6 September 1975
1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and thatfave crept up every so often
since then. In one form or. xr, the allegations are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD hi connected with the Agency.

The allegations are totaly founded. 7
SD)
2. The facts re uae igo are as follows: |

a. 3 I was instructed by

Mr. R.G. Roced = fte superior at that time, to
make a th i

thin the Agency at Headquarters
to determin Harvey OSWALD had ever been |
used by the Agend\Ger been connected with 4t in any i

conceivable way. ordered me to make the checks
directly and personally to the degree possible and not {
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-

plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R. |
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one sof the
Agency's key contact officials with the Warren |
Commission. . : i

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index
of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I
rechecked the Main Index and found no: record beyond
that which I had already obtained.before (plus, those
items which had been integrated {nto the records system
since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO
records which indicated any Agency connection with
OSWALD. !

4. I recall very clearly that we were extremely
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American: returning
from the USSR, might have been routinely’ debriefed by
Deb, thus having established contact with’ the Agency.

The same point has now, quite understandably, been made

by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this i
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid
xeason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time. '
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD |
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners, |
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite i
uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in
those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade ES were so many perschs travelling to
and from the So) feSoatcn that DCD was incapable of talk-

and sropteterGart Sr ake was instituted. In

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J, EDGAR HOOVER
26 November 1963 ~ 11:20 a.m, oon

DCI: J just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

Ht We have had the very best support that we could possibly j
expect from you.

DCI: Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

E: We will feel free to do that

pa: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to |
make it.

H: We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question |
that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have !
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i: Mexico Cit
We have now found that the: photograph that was ta cen was not
that of Oswald. We do find from our informant down there that ji
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has - ‘
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit :
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him
the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wald take three
weeks, He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

DCI: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have i
those operational sources down there. We want to handle them
very carefully. It involves.some very high level people down
there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned
in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that |
has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc. H
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the .
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be
sure that whatever is said in the report is conférred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said i
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

DCI: Well that will be fine. Thank you

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements
might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they
will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-
spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates
that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous
interviews. I raged with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

Ordinarily kéag an attempt is made to kesp then from contact with mx anyone in
govermnent circles soas to avoid indiscretions. Any agent recruited in a foreign
country is brought to Cuba and arrangements are made so that he has no contacts

completed, his departure from Cuba is not made known to anyon= attached to hime

“In recruitment of Cubans, an effort is made to find those knowing the fewest
possible parsons. “If the Cuban who is recruited is employed in an office or
factory or works sote other place, an effort is made to have him contime his
work so as to use his situation to provide true covers; instruction is given ab
hours when he is not working. If the agent has any trouble after he has been
reoruited, ths DGI tries to help him as mach as possible without breaking down
compartirentation or his covere

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the UGI covers the ex-
penses of his family. If a Cuban who is recruited is usamployed, it looks for
a cover adapted to his situation, and the NGI takes care of all the expenses
the agent has, including those of his family if he is married. He receives his
training in the hours adapted to his cover position. His life, like that of the
agent who is working, mst contime normal, just as it was before recruitment.

anticipating a request from the W@mission, named by President
Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials
supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-
vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by
the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with the/Sylvia DURAN
aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States
Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich
inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some
other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.
‘The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-
vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed
to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of
the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this
manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to
telephone taps.

almost no time with him. ie do hope, however, that he has been able to
get some idea of our Station and its work by his talks with the various
officers who have been able to spend some time with him during these two

Perhaps when we are little less rushed, he can return to Mexico for
another visit.

Oswald was in Mexico City, using as a key the fact that
Oswald's attempt to obtain a visa was probably communicated to
Washington on Friday or Saturday, September 27 or 28. Scott

The three of us were driven by Rolfe Larson in an

Several observations were immediately obvious. The

scselled for it. The embassies, although theoretically reachable
from the Hotel del Comercio or the inter-city bus stations by
local bus, are in practice so lccated that reaching them by

Silvia Duran's statements and from the “open” investigations
carried on by FBI agents and Mexican police agents throughout

. Mexico, supplemented to some extent by the information obtained

through the CIA's wire-tapping activities and the CIA's ~

rather, for example, it would use phrases like "in the after-
noon" in place of "4:05 p.m." Also, no absulute quotes would
be used. Only the substance of conversations would be given.
The sources for this narrative would be stated to be Silvia
Duran's interrogation, the "open" investigations and "other
confidential sources considered reliable by the Commission and
the federal intellizgen: yed." Mr. Scott's reply

1. One of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate other
than his first was in the afternoon. See paragraph 1l of the

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

This seems so because:
a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the
Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday.

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban

Silvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get
a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip

I would include in our letter to ane GIA the following

1. Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

ae supposed to have taken place in an automobile outside the
fe + ” Cuban Enbassy in Hexico City? -".--

2. Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet
Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? If you
do, can we find out its contents?

3. Reference is made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your
letter. Would it be possible for us to see the full report
: of the Mextean police interrogations. of Mra. Duran and her
husbarid?. Tae te eee : :

4. Paragraph 7 ot your letter states that Oswald,
"that same afternoon," came back "again" to the Cuban
Embassy. Does this mean that he was there twice the same
day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous
day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the
Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this
sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed information
found in the subsequent paragraphs. In general, we would

appreciate as much q ation as you can give us on the

6. Reference is made to lefrep sentence in the 2nd

subparagraph gf paragraph 12b. Is there any significance
to the word, "Although"? We wonder whether the informant
meant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran
reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued
to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

. 7. Refermce is again made to the 2nd subparagraph of
. Raragraph 1b. our letter states that Mrs. Duran told the
Soviet Embassy” that Oswald“knew no one in Cuba> and that
the Soviet official "echoed her statement that the American
_ was not known.” It is unclear to us whether this discussion
- 4nvolved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet
- officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not knowing

anyone in the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies.

8. Reference is made to paragraph 12c. Was the “direct
conversation" between one of the members of the Soviet
Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was
at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that
Mrs. Duran sent Oswald personally over to the Soviet tae

9. Reference is again made to paragraph 1l2c. Could
you @larify the many references to the "address" veferred to

10. ‘Throughout your entire letter the term "Soviet
Consulate” seems, to be used interchangeably with the term
"Soviet Embassy," Likewise with "Cuban Consulate" and
“Cuban Embassy." We assume from this that the Soviet
Consulate and the Soviet Znbassy must be the same in Mexico

1. Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make
the following recommendations concerning the further handling
and possible disposition of QUWIN:

a. I believe the original purpose for which
QJWIN was continued and sent to his present under—

cover tifa the Se ident validity
to justify the Eee ee Hee youd the
termination of His present contract for this purpose
-_ PROMIGMTED

b. QUWIN, i RO al competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles
in Europe where we have very few assets. Whether this
is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends
on the determination of how he can be used either by *%
the German Station,or the Austrian Station or by
any other KUBARK a8 a long term unofficial
cover agent. He is not being used at the present time.
He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any
operational assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of
Station Luxembourg and RABNEY be consulted by
Headquarters for their best recommendations as to
the continued use of QJWIN. After these recommendations
are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian
stations be consulted for their possible interest in
using him. If after these discussions a sensible
framework for the operational use of QJWIN can be
established, I would recommend we continue him. If
not, I would recommend that he be terminated at the
time his present contract expires.

2. As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation
which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for
security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully
familiar as I orally advised you on 26 June 1963, except for
one precautionary "life line", aspects of this case have 4

been terminated and rent perhaps for minor
accountings, be co! ( BUST

1, It makes iieete PROUIE ITED ne» had at es an

OI interest in Oswald. As soon as I had heard OswalB's name, I recalled
that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sometime in Summer 1960 --
with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the layang
on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable channels, At the
moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family u
were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival. 7

2. I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck >
me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I
told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get
the information we need, because this individual looks odd." } We were
particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on thg Minsk
factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city
itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop
target personality dossiers. 0

3. I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at
the time. Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's artival,
I do not know what action developed thereafter.

4. As an afterthought, I Yalso that at the time I was becoming

.  inereasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered
in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet 4
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually ~
divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning “home”.

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases, We established links between

some of these women and the KGB, KUDESK became interested in the developing
trend we had come across. It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experi d in the USSR, that we showed operational
intelligence interest in chectarwey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Repgrt conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that ‘
effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1 Dissemination to the Intelligence Community ;
E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,
all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by
cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file. Ad-
ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.
Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff
received copies of all CSCI's.
