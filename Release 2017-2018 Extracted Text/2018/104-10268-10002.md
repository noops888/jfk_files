SUBJECT

REFERE

ations of Lee Harvey OSWALD'S

onnection with the Agency

Memorandum of Conversation, Dan

-Rather/Les Midgley and

the DCI,

Dated 6 September 1975

ISa/5CE

LAURES

1.

The referent memorandum contains two points

which require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

The allegations are totally

tutfounded.

2. The facts

regarding

this matter are as follows:

November 1963 I was instructed by

• MI. R.G. RoCOLA

my immediate superior at that time, to

make a thoroigh chec Jithin the Agency at Headquarters

to determine whether ee Harvey OSWALD had ever been

used by the Agencylor been connected with it in any

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

He also ex-

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the warren

Commission®

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus those

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination.

There was nothing in the

records which indicated any Agency connection with

Administrative Office called the Office of Personnel

and received the word that there was no record on an

employee or an applicant for employment named Lee

I also checked the Office of Medical

Services and found no record on OSWALD.

1. The Covert Action Staff also found no record

on him.

Finally, I also checked the records of the

cI state's Operational Approval Group (CI/OA) with

negative results.

My checks were completed on 4 December 1963

and I then sent a brief

informal note to Mr. Rocca

that the results showed that Lee Harvey OSWALD

Iy a statement to this effect

was communicated to the Warren Commission.

regarding use or employment-

of OSWALD Kad been requested by the foreign divisions

of their appropriate stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

I recall very clearly that we were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American returning

from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by

DCD, thus having.

established contact with the Agency

The same point has now, quite understandably been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

- reason

for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been to the USSR and returned to the Us before

1957/1958®

Travel to the Soviet Union by westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that time was quite

uncommon and

we were hungry for eyewitness information in

those days.

The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end

of that decade there were so many persons travelling to

and from the SovietUnion that DCD was incapable of talk

ing to all of them.

and

Therefore, a program of selectivity

specific target applicability was

instituted

In

light of the above

seems to me that OSWALD if he

came to DaD"@attention at all-would have easily been

by-passed because he

simply did not possess the type of

informa sion that ped was seeking at that time.

DCD would

sureby have

used its limited manpower on travellers who

had

ag muc

greater access in the USSR.

should be added that my above-described

the Agency file holding produced no record or

that any other

US Government agency had used

him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rurnors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.

We have now found that the: photograph that was ta sen was not

that of Oswald.

We do find from our informant dom there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had.

He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wald take three

weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there.

We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

Mc. Katzenbach

who is handling it for the Departmeni-

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

that will be released to the public, probably through the White

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be

checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned

in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of

the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc..

all of which of course we are gathering.

The aspects of the

Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned.

It is his

intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be

sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said

and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make-

Well that will be fine. Thank you

Good bye.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Rocca

"Internal Memo Regarding

with: Warren

:Commission

Agency's Position in Dealing

1. The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the Director has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM

Thur

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on tha

morning.

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a sha

but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basit issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mi. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WH source. I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go torthe Commission prior to the Director's appearatice unless

we have fiest had agme preliminary reaction of made sure that the

Director is Ixty aware of its implications since it could well serve

ao the basin lojudetailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

Feview thas

carefully and made a decision

westion of timing.

Given the schedule, you wil

appren

ate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

HIBITED

On 17 December Mr. Papich

dvised that the Bureau was

named. by President

Johnson to look into this case, for copies

0f Bureau materials

supporting or complementing the report already subnitted.

He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with theySylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico.

Mr. Papich

Inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Coumission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive Information which could relate to

telephone taps.

Mr. Papich again raised the question on 19

consultation with Mr. Angleton and Mr.

Oswald was in Mexico City, using as a key the fact that

12:00 Noon to 3:00 y.M.

After having decided among. ourselves what further

work had to be done while we were in Mexico, we went to

sir. Anderson's office where we met Mir. Anderson and Rolfe

Larson. The following points were covered, with the conclus-

Ions as stated:

We asked that the exact time, rather than the

whether Oswald Immediately began

his visits to the embassies or whether he first checked in at

his hotel. The FBI agreed to do this.

We reminded Anderson and Larson that we had sonc

Washington on this matter which we had not yet received. We

could make them without actually quoting the entire trans-

or where the meaning was obscure and therefore difficult to

This seems so because:

a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on sunday, Monday, luesday 0r

e. Oswald's argument with Azque was in the after-

occurred after the first visit, see the second police Inter-

the argument with Azque took place was itself different from

and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which

SIlvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip

of paper with her name and telephone

telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles

in Europe where we have very few assets.

Whether this

is of sufficient worth to continue his

services depends

on the determination of how he can be used either by

the Austrian Station or by

as a long term unofficial

cover agent.

He is not being used at the present time.

He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any

operational assignments are concerned.

C.

It is recommended that the present Chief of

Station Iuxembourg and

be consulted by

Headquarters for their best recommendations as to

the continued use of QWIN.

After these recommendations

are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian

stations be consulted for their possible interest in

using him.

If after these discussions a sensible

framework

for the operational use of QJWIN can be

established,

I would recommend we continue him.

I would recommend that he be terminated at the

We established links between

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry.. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special

analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1 Dissemination

to the Intelligence Community

E.2

Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically)

including

disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's,

and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
