JAMES LANZA and the "Boss" of the San Jose group as JOE

CERRITO. LICATA also spoke of another such group as

"our

in Texas. He did not elaborate further, but the

inference drawn by informant was that other such small

sroups were located elsewhere, and their existence was not

Recent investigation has determined that DESIMONE

is presently residing at 517 Tyron Street, El Cajon,
