With regard to the relations with Mexico or the official

policy of the country, we can point out that although the in-

formation reccined to looper in volume, this work is not ex-

ploiting the information facilities.

Besides, in the first as well as the second case, the

sources available to the Center are not known in the Informa

tion Service.

• We can deduce the information capabilities by

analyzing circles or individuals from whom the information is

obtained.

However, we don't know what the relations are be-

tween the Center and these informants, therefore we cannot

guide the information collection effort.

ANALYSIS ABOUT INFORNATION ON ENENY ACTIVITIES WORK:

BACKGROUND:

About the information work with countries in the M-A

Section with regard tu Information about counter-revolutionar

type and aggression plans wo can point out, in general, its

principal successes and deficiencles.

Through previous experience and the analysis of informa

tion received from the countrics of this Section concerning

counter-revolutionary activities, It was confirmed once more

that this is the zone preferred by Impertalism for locating

training camps for counter-revolutionary clements, getting

o the point where this assumes serious characteristics in

certain places or specific zones, such as the case of the

Peten zone in Guatemala and Puerto Cabezas and the Maiz Is

lands in Nicaragua.

From Information about this type of activity we can

point out that some as

Analyzing all these previous phenomena

we can point

cover the following aspects that will be basic from the

standpoint of aggression plans.

1.

3. Location of operations bases for pirate launches and

counter-revolutionary groups that will operate from nearby

countries.

This is directly related with the plans for
