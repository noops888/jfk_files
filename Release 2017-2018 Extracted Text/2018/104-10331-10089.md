Joan, please print off and give to Jeff,
‘have spoken to the Historical Review Group (HRG), which is processing the JFK collection under the JFK Act, regarding the two
questions that Sen. Specter posed to the DCI. Here is their response.
Specter asked the OC! whether there is anything in the JFK collection about to be released:
1. concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers not previously disclosed; and

2. concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers that CIA did not give to the Warren Commission.

Response to Question 1: There is no information to be disclosed that links Oswald to any bebo spe une cal those eeu
released (Cuba, USSR).. However, ther 1a ic act IS

prooressive declassification ay of the JFK Acta many details on n Oswalt's ac actives this heat decassifid ad released (and the
SEK Board may release more).

Response to Question 2: The HRG is unaware that any of this information was not previously shared with the Warren Commission.
However, it is possible that there may be some additional details or specific documents that the Warren Commission did not have. The
HRG would have to review the Warren Commission Report, then compare the specific documents provided to the WC with the documents
in the collection to see if there is any difference. To do this, the HRG would have to dedicate a couple of reviewers to the task for a
significant period of time. | told the HRG that | would get back to them on whether this comparison was required by the OCI.

FYI, The House Select Committee on Assassinations’ report indicated that the information CIA had not shared with the Warren
Commission related to assassination plots against Castro, not to Oswald's activities.
