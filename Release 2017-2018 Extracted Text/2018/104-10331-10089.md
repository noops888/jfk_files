Specter Request

Joan, please print off and give to Jeff,

I have spoken to the Historical Review Group (HRG), which is processing the JFK collection under the JFK Act, regarding the two

questions that Sen. Specter posed to the DCI. Here is their response.

Specter asked the DCl whether there is anything in the JFK collection about to be released:

1. concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers not previously disclosed; and

2. concerning Oswald's connection(s) to foreign powers that CIA did not give to the Warren Commission.

Response to Question 1: There is no information to be disclosed that links Oswald to any foreign powers other than those previously

released (Cuba, USSR). However, there will be additional details made public about these contacts. For instance, the Russian intelligence

officer who met with Oswald in Mexico City has written a book that has information not previously known to CIA. Also, under the

progressive declassification standards of the JFK Act, many details on Oswald's activities have beeri declassified and released (and the

JFK Board may release more).

Response to Question 2: The HRG is unaware that any of this information was not previously shared with the Warren Commission.

However, it is possible that there may be some additional details or specific documents that the Warren Commission did not have. The

HRG would have to review the Warren Commission Report, then compare the specific documents provided to the WC with the documents

in the collection to see if there is any difference. To do this, the HRG would have to dedicate a couple of reviewers to the task for a

significant period of time. I told the HRG that I would get back to them on whether this comparison was required by the DCI.

FYI, The House Select Committee on Assassinations' report indicated that the information CIA had not shared with the Warren

Commission related to assassination plots against Castro, not to Oswald's activities.
