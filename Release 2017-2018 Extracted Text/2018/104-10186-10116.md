To obtain these data we must fundamentally make use of the e

great importance, since these will be the persons of whom they
will take advantage in obtaining iaformation, moving up,

and placing fhemselves in the desired position. Moreover,

in case any information is acquired about them, if it only
gives us a reference to the person's name, we will know who
is meant, and thus we can avoid a great deal of work for our
comrades abroad, since they will not have to send us these
data and can restrict themselves to current information
