To obtain these data we must fundamentally make use of the

agent, and they will be obtained in the course of his

great importance, since these will be the persons of whom they

will take advantage in obtaining information, moving up,

Moreover,

in case any information is acquired about them, if it only

gives us a reference to the person's name, we will know who

is meant, and thus

we can avoid a great deal of work for our
