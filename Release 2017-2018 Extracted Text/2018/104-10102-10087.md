confirm that CIA was involved in this incident... ~

(1) Felix ASENCIO Trejo. There is a 201 file
on the individual which indicates: that a POA was granted.
on 4 March 1964. since sybject was. of interest. to us as a
possible candidate. for paramilitary operations against Cuba.
The POA was cancelled on.20 August 1964 with ‘no. indication
that subject was ever actually. used operationally.

(2) Wilfredo MARTINGZ- Diaz. We have no positively
identifiable information on this individual. .

(3) Lazaro Gustavo ARECES Alvarez... There is a
201 file on the individual which indicates that a POA was
granted 7 July 1964 for intended use.as a seaman aboard a
CIA vessel involved in maritime operations. The POA was
cancelled 8 September 1964-with the indication: that the
subject was not hired. 8

U. 1971. There is nothing ‘in files reviewed to
indicate that we had any coatact with'the subject ‘mentionod
in the report or were involved in the alleged incident,

(1) Jesus DOMINGUEZ Benitez... No CIA traces: on

~ “subject were found.

2.. It is noted that ‘the: above totalstwenty-one. separate
analytical sections whoreas..there are actually. twenty-four.
alleged assassination attempts.” This due to the fact ‘that
the analyses of the txo incidents of 26° July 1961 have. been
conbined since.they both occurred’ on the same-day and were
allegedly executed by the.same group. The. treatment of the
alloged June 1965 poisoning attempt is part of. the ‘analysis
of the mid 1964 incident :because ‘the alleged pepetrator ‘is
relatéc to the. group described therein. “The. incident. described
in Castro's report asmid'1965 has. been ‘combined..with the
analysis. of the, 1966 incident since both were, allegedly carried
out by the sane group. . .



3. In summary, of the twenty-four incidents described
in Castro's report, the files reviewed. indicate ‘that CIA
! had no involvement in fifteen of. the cases; i.e. nover had
j any contact with the individuals mentioned or was not in
wel contact with then at the time of the alleged incidents. In
| the remaining nine cases, CIA had operational relationships
} with some of the individuals mentioned but. not. for the purpose
of assassination, . [tis noted that. one case is currently
being reviewed by a SSC staff menber for solection of documents
;to-be-sanitized.. This case (Rolando CUBELA Secades):was not
reviewed in connection with this. memorandum. Of the: twenty-
~“three-cases: reviewed, nothing has been. found to substantiate
the charges that CIA directed its agents: to assassinate Castro.
