you has been summoned for jury duty at Circuit Courtroom #6, Fairfax
County Courthouse, commencing 17 November 1975, It is my understanding
that you believe such employees should not serve on a jury.

The employee is identified by a copy of his jury summons returned
under separate cover and, as previously agreed, we ask that this letter
and the name of the employee not be joined together. Mr. Edmund Cohen
of my office will be pleased to explain the circumstances further if you
desire. He can be reached at the follo.sing number: 351-5648.

We appreciate your efforts on our behalf.

Sincerely,

Op ALS (Onnrne
