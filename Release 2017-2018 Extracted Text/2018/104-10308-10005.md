and 2,500.00 expenses payable in advance, CAMERON promised to
check with his contacts after returning from a pending trip to

within reason the money would be paid.

4. GOMEZ contacted Juan "Pepin" BOSCH in early April 1964
and BOSCH agreed to advance the $100,000,00 with the BABUN group
advancing the $2,500.00 expense money, Although GOMEZ had BOSCiI's
word that he would provide the money, BABUN became somewhat
apprehensive and had AMCANOE-1 contact Julio ECBO Olavarria
(201-215813) in New York on 4 April, LOBO immediately agreed to
the terms providing his name was never involved. Accordingly,
on 25 April, BARUN gave CAMERON the $2,500.00 and CAMERON
advised his group. On 28 April, CAMERON reported that his group
had already called their man in PBRUMiN telling him to proceed
as planned adding that "their other man" would be heading for
PBRUMEN shortly, Their final comment was "wo hope to have sone
g00d news for you between 20 and 25 May." LOBO and ANCANCE-1
plan to fly to Hiami on 19 May to arrange the transfer of the
$100,000.00 to a safety deposit box, the keys of which will be

held jointly by CAMERON and a confidant of LOBO.

5, The identities of those persons in the CAMERON group
and how they plan to effect this operation is still unknown,
The BABUN associates are reluctant to make any unnecessary
queries since they have invested but $2,500.00 and it was made

fairly clear _b: at the beginning that the MAFIA was
invol MERON also revealed during the negotiations that
hia contac police officer in the St, Louis, Missouri, Vice

Squad who was about to retire from the force and who had numerous
connections in the MAFIA, CAMERON also implicd that “the other mar
in question was in Spain, Because of his position between the St.
Louis contacts and the BABUN group, CAMERON has become somewhat
nervous about the operation but not to the extent that he would

be willing to compromise it to the police, As CAMERON knows, he
could also be indicted for conspiracy and he also knows that if
there was any treachery on'his part, the BAGUN group would not
hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE,
