In connection with the investigation of the

ALBERT ANASTASIA murder, the District Attorney's Office of

the New York County was advised by the United States Department

of assistance in this investigation. Detective GRAFF ascer-

tained the federal narcotics agent with this information was

OSCAR LEON DAVIS, presently a Deputy UnitedStates Marshal

DE TORRES related he was not close to TRAFFICANTE but claimed

that through his informant, CIsCo, he would be able to secure

further information regarding TRAFFICANTE.

DE TORRES stated

he originally advised Federal Narcotics Agent DAVIS of the

above information in November, 1961.

He said DAVIS told him

there was

a $10,000.00 reward for information in the ANASTASIA

homicido, but later stated that after checking with authorities

in New York City he had ascertained the reward was only

$7,000.00. According to Detective

GRAFF, there 1s no reward

in this case:

Detective GRAFF identified CISCO as UBALDO SANTACROCE,

New York City Police Department, Number B- 474573, also known

as CISCO BOB, and interviewed him.

SANTACROCE stated he was

presently employed on the docks in Hoboken, New Jersey, on

the "Sun Dance", & fishing boat, SANTACROCE admitted he had

told people he had worked for ANASTASIA, but told Detective

GRAFF there was no truth in these statements. It was ascer-

tained SANTACROCE was a narcotics user, and he was characterized

as a "bum" whose information could not

be considered reliable.

MARCERIA was identified as JOSE RAMON FAYAT, 441

southwest ath street, miami,

Florida, owner of the Ideal

Restaurant,

755

West

Flagler Street, Miami, Florida.

However,

SANTACROCE could not

substantiate any of the

story he had

furnished' DE TORRES.

Detective GRAFF advised he had closed out this

phase of his investigation as to the ANASTASIA killing as

being based on unreliable information.

Detective GRAFF stated it is the policy of the

District Attorney's Office in New York County that no

indictment be issued until that office is ready to apprehend

those named in the indictment.
