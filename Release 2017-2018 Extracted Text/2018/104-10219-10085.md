MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 7

SUBJECT : 1). Involvement of George Campbell, i
201-844271, with Mikhail Vlasovich i -
Ivanov, 201-791386 *

2) Possible Identification of Mikhail :
Viasovich Ivanov as William Hamilton
Martin, 201-282338 ie

1. In 1961 George Campbell was hired by IBM and
sent to Vienna, Austria as a systems engineer. On 11
June 1968, George Campbell, in an interview with an ct
officer of this Agency, reported a recruitment attempt
by a Soviet employee of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), Mikhail Vlasovich Ivanov, which, Campbell
said, had United States security as its ultimate goal.
Campbell gave the following information by way: of his
background:

a) that he spent his youth in the state of
Washington sate een

by that he acquired a BS in mathematics at the
University of Washington (CA 53-56?)

c) that he worked for two years in the engineer-
.ing department of Boeing Aircraft (CA 57-59?)

i d) that he then returned to the University of
Washington for a 4 in mathematics (CA 59-607)"

e) that subsequent to his acquisition of his

head of the computer section of IAEA in January 1966.
There were no prior traces on Ivanov).

that he first came into contact with Ivanov in the

summer of 1966 (July or August).

that one of his nain jobs was to gain the confidence of
Ivanov with respect to selling to the IAEA an advanced model
of the IBM 360. Campbell went on te relate that his
relationship with Ivanov had developed in such a fashion

as to indicate that Ivanov was developing him for the

benefit of Soviet Intelligence.

2. Station, after June 68 interviews,

decided to use Campbell as a ‘window’ on Ivanov, which

Campbell agreed to.

that Ivanov was more in control of Campbell than we
were, a.decision was made to terminate Campbell's

relationship with Ivanov.

After it appeared to Headquarters:

relationship was as follows:

a) Campbell would go to several meetings with
Ivanov in which Cazpbell would be ‘wired’ for sound
“b) Ivanov would then be presented with the
recordings of the meeting, told that "US security’

had been on to him all throughout his relationship

with Campbell, and that he, Ivanov, might be

exposed for utilizing the United Nations activity

(IAEA) as cover for espionage purposes.
On 10 Jan 69 Ivanov was presented with recordings of the
meetings with Campbell, but he refused to take them.
Last available information on Ivanov indicates that he
departed Vienna PCS in April 1970. Last available infor-
mation on Campbell is that he was still in Vienna in
January 1970.

3. It will be noted (paragraph one} that Campbell

told the| Station officer, in June 1968, that he

had first met Ivanov in 1966, a period of two years. It

should be pointed out that a transcript of a conversa-

tion between Campbell and Ivanov (6 Sep 68) mutually

acknowledged knowing each other for ten years. Further,

Campbell was not questioned concerning this discrepancy.
4. In George Campbeli's CI/OA folder, there is

identified as a possible trace from an ONI Investigative

‘report, dated 1 March 61, one George Sheffield Campbell.

George S. Campbell on 18 Nov 60 (date of interview),
was a graduate student in mathematics at the University
of Washington. He was being interviewed as a ‘developed
informant" in the case of William Hamilton Martin, the

NSA defector. Campbell said that he had met Martin

William Hamilton Martin was a graduate student in

mathenatics at University of Washington). (Note that

indicates that they have known each other since circa i ech

1958 and that the ONI report indicates that Martin had

that the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS)

(Note that year and month of James Hanilton Martin

conceivable, therefore, that James Hamilton Martin and
John Hamilton Martin are connected with the same pass-

the Spanish Civil War, was killed and the Soviets

Also, in its study of the Institute of Pacific Relations :

(IPR), the SISS shows that in June 1944 one Nellie

7. It is suggested, at this point, based largely

on the striking facial similarity of Ivanov and

William Hamilton Martin, that Ivanov and Willian

and
Hamilton Martin are one im the same person. Further,

that William Hamilton Nartin is possibly Soviet Illegal

Intelligence Officer who ‘defected’ in 1960 and

reappeared in Vienna in 1966 as Mikhail Vlasovich

Ivanov. This theory, in light of Campbell's relation-
ship with both Martin and Ivanov, would necessitate

Campbells knowledge that Ivanov and Martin were the baa

same person. A plausible explanation as te why the

Soviets would risk drawing attention to the Ivanov/
Campbell. relationship lies in the fact that this Agency

installed an audio penetration in Ivanov's apartment in

“Vienna in July 1966. station, at that tine,’

suspected Ivanov of being a KGB S&T officer. The
Soviets at a later date may have discovered the audio

_ Penetration of Ivanov's apartment, at which operations

‘ conerning Campbell may have been discussed, and decided
that the best way to protect Ivanov and Carpbell was to
owe

Campbell ‘walk in' and ‘tell all'.
