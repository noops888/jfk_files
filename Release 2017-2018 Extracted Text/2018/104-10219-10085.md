Involvement o? George Campbell,

201-844271

with Mikhail Vlasovich

Ivanov, 20i-791386

2)

Possible Identification of Mikhail

Vlasovich Ivanov

as William Manilton

Martin, 201-282338

1. In 1961 George Campbell was hired by IB! and •

sent to Vienna, Austria as a systems engineer. On 11

June 1968, George Campbell, in an interview with an

officer of this Agency, reported a recruitment attempt

by a Soviet emplojee of the International Atomic Energy

Agency (IAEA), Mikhail Vlasovich Ivanov, which, Campbell

said, had United States security as its ultimate goal.

Campbell gave the following information by way of his

background:

a) that he spent his youth in the state of

Washington

b) that he acquired a BS in mathematics at the

University of Washington (CA 53-56?)

c) that he worked for two years in the engineer-

,ing department of Boeing Aircraft (CA 57-59?)

d) that he then returned to the University of

Washington for a DE in mathematics (CA 59-60?)

e) that subsequent to his acquisition of his

(Ivanov (DOB 1 Dec 31) first appeared in the West as

• head of the computer section of IAEA in January 1966•

There were no prior traces on Ivanov). Campbell stated

that he first came into contact with Ivanov in the

summer of 1966 (July or August) • Campbell further said

that one of his nain jobs was to gain the confidence of

Ivanov with respect to selling to the INEA an advanced model

of the IBM 360. Campbell went on to relate that his

relationship with Ivanov had developed in such a fashion

as to indicate that Ivanov was developing hin for the

benefit of Soviet Intelligence.

Station, after June 68 interviews,

decided

to use Campbell as a 'windor' on Ivanov, which

Campbell agreed to. After it appeared to Headquarters:

that Ivanov was more in control of Campbell than we

were, a decision was made to terminate Campbell's

relationship with Ivanov. The plan to terminate the

relationship has as follows:

a) Campbell would go to several meetings with

Ivanov in which Carpbell would be "wired' for sound

b) Ivanov would then be presented with the

recordings of the meeting, told that "US security"

had been on to hin all throughout his relationship

with Caspbell, and that he, Ivanov, might be

exposed for utilizing the United Nations activity

(IAEA) as cover for espionage purposes.

On 10 Jan 69 Ivanov was presented with recordings of the

meetings with Campbell, but he refused to take them.

Last available inforation on Ivanov indicates that he

departed Vienna PCS in April 1970. Last available infor-

mation on Campbell is that he was still in Vienna in

January 1970.

3. It will be noted (paragraph one) that Campbell

told the

Station officer, in June 1968, that he

had first met Ivanov in 1966, a period of two jears. It

should be pointed out that a transcript of a conversa-

tion between Campbell and Ivanov (6 Sep 68) mutually

acknowledged knowing each other for ten years. Further,

Campbell was not questioned concerning this discrepancy.

4. In George Campbell's CI/DA folder, there is

identified as a possible trace from

an ONI Investigative

'report, dated 1 March 61, one George Sheffield Campbell.

George S. Campbell on 18 Nov 60 (date of interview),

was a graduate student in mathematics at the University

of Nashington. He was being interviewed as a developed

informant' in the case of William Hamilton Martin, the

NSA defector. Campbell said that he had met Martin

through Janes Lyons, a fellow employee at Boeing Air-

(SIC)

plane Cod, in the spring of 1957. (From Jul 56-Jul 57

Willian Hamilton Martin was a graduate student in

mathenatics at University of Washington). (Note that

the transcript of the 6 Sep 68 Ivanov-Campbell neeting

indicates that they have known each other since circa

1958 and that the 0'I report indicates that Martin had

known Campbell since 1957) •

5. The following information on William Hamilton

Martin and family is derived from Martin's Statement of

Personal History filled out in conjunction with his

application for employment with NSA:

a) Father: John Hamilton Martin Dob: 24 Feb 09 •

b) Mother: Nellie Lucillee Martin née Wright

Dob: 3 Dec 12

c) Residences:

A) 1931 William Hamilton MartinDOB) - 1935

Georgia

B) 1935-1937 Tennessee

C) August 1937 Washington State

6. A review of William Hamilton Martins File,

201-282338, indicates that his parents were traced with

negative results (Memorandum for the file, 21 Sep 60,

filed in 201-282338).

It should be noted, however

that the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS)

lists the following information for one Janes

e) address:

d) San Francisco Series Passport 131264,

(Note that year and month of James Hanilton Martin

passport issue coincide with year and month of William

Hamilton Martin nove to Washington State). It is

conceivable, therefore, that James Hamilton Martin and

John Hamilton Martin are connected with the same pass-

port, i.e..

a) The dohn Hamilton Martin who went over to

the Spanish Civil Var, was killed and the Soviets

substituted an Intelligence Officer in his place.

b) that John Hamilton Martin turned his pass-

pore in upon arrival in Spain, as

was the practice,

and it was 'lost' and used in a slightly altered

fashion by a Soviet Intelligence Officer.

Also, in its study of the Institute of Pacific Relations

(IPR), the SISS shows that in June 1944 one Nellie

Wright, not further identified, was employed in a

clerical capacity by the IPR.

7. It is suggested, at this point, based largely

on the striking facial similarity of Ivanor and

Willian Hamilton Martin, that Ivanov and Millian

Hanilton Martin are one in the same person. Further,

that William Hamilton Martin is possibly Soviet Illegal

Intelligence Officer who 'defected' in 1960 and

reappeared in Vienna in 1966 as Mikhail Vlasovich

Ivanov. This theory, in light of Campbell's relation-

ship with both Martin and Ivanov, would necessitate

Canpbells knowledge that Ivanov and Martin were the

sane person. A plausible explanation as to why the

Soviets would risk drawing attention to the Ivanov/

Caspbell relationship lies in the fact that this Agency

installed an audio penetration in Ivanor's apartnent in

Vienna in July 1966.

station, at that time,

suspected Ivanov of being a KGB S&T officer. The

Soviets at a later date may have discovered the audio

penetration of Ivanov's apartnent, at which operations

conerning Canpbell nay have been discussed, and decided

that the best way to protect Ivanov and Carpbell was to

have

has Campbell "walk in' and "tell all'.
