b

1 nm: with the Department of Justice today, I
confirmed that, lwae our man. I outlined the pre-
liminary information we had developed on the transactions between
him and one Lefty Rosenthal,

: ice wae advised that our information disclosed that
had paseed silencers and grenadea to Rosenthal

during July 1965, and that in Cctober 1966 he had furnished pencils
and fuses. I also stated that it wae our understanding that|

|was in contact with FDI/Miami and that it had been advised

Of these dealings. Justice-was told that the items involved were not
of Agency origin. It wae emphasized, however, that this was our
preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.

3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed
jas its contact but apparently the details are some-
what vague. To make a federal case agaiaet Rosecthal because of his
suspected involvement in the bombings, it will be necessary to show
that the iteme used were obtained through interstate commerce. A
preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title 18 Section 837.
Out of concern for the allegation of entrapment, Justice asked that

the FBI.

S as a conduit, Justice is considering thé possibility
