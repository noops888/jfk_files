1.

On 14 December 1970,

the undersigned visited WUSHARP

at the latter's request and had the following discussion.

WUSHARP asked whether ve could use NISLAB/l asa means of

cont acting Cuban officials for the pirpose of establishing

Ities

which could later be exploited by WUSHARP assets.

I explained to WUSHARP that WUSLAB/l had been instructed.

to adopt a passive role. in relationship to his Cuban

contacts, and to respond only to contact initiated by the

Cubans®

NESIARP stated that they understand our point of view

thoroughly.

..2=

At this meeting I Uriefed KI'SIARD on the teleptione

call from

a DGI representative cited in reference.

I told

WUSHARP that I would give them a memorandum on this as sell

as a copy of the PCQ on Rogelio Rodriguez Lopcz. (201-332665)

in which they expressed definite interest.
