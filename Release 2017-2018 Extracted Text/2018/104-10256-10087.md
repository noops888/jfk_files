Memorandum

: Ay
> Chief, OP/RD S DATE: 4 March 1968

SUBJECT: BAKER, Bruce Arman

On 7 Fepruary, this gentleman telephoned my office. His address is:

379 President Drive, N. Es
Blaine Village, Minnesota

Mr. Baker stated that he has been in contact with a Mr. MITCHELL
WERBELL, III of Powder Springs, Georgia. \

Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is in the business of manufacturing
weapons and delivering them by air throughout the world. Mr. Baker
understands that Mr. Werbell does this for the Central Intelligence
Agency.

Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is a supposedly reputable man.
Baker understands, from Werbell, that Baker will have to get a
CIA security clearance to fly for Werbell.

Mr. Baker has served in the military. He has had some paramilitary
training. He belongs in a "jump club" and now participates in
"freefali", etc. He has a Morse Code proficiency and a Radio
License Second Class. He has Spanish language proficiency and would
be willing to collect for us.

This man persists-on pursuing me re this CIA/Werbell relationship.

I tell him I don't kmow a thing about it. It seems he has a smuggling
record when he was 17 and he's afraid this may keep him from getting
this Werbell "CIA" clearance.
