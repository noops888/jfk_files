OSWALD, Lee Harvey

The look-out cara process can be divided into two categories, (a) one

which can be referred to as the judicial aspect and (b) the ministerial as-

pect.

The first category concerns itself with the basis or criteria used

in determining whether or not a card shall be requested.

The second cate-

gory concerns itself with the mechanical steps involved in preparing a

look-out card from the time a decision to request a card is made until the

filing of the card.

Since the purpose of this study is primarily concerned

with the procedures in handling the look-out cards, emphasis will be placed

on the ministerial aspect of the look-out card process with reference to

the judicial aspect primarily for reasons of background.

recommendations at the conclusion of this report, which can be said to fall

within the judicial realm of the process, are offered not as criteria for

refusing a passport, but only as a means of avoiding the routine issuance

of a passport to an individual with a questionable background. Moreover,

the study was confined to inquiries to determine how the look-out cards

are handled in a typical "OSWALD" case and specifically the procedures

followed in the Lee Harvey OSWALD case itself.

This study is broken down

into the following categories: (1) the general overall procedures, (2)

the Lee Harvey OSWALD case,

(3) security survey of the Clearance Section,

(4) recommendations, and (5) summary of SY/Files having derogatory infor-

mation relating to personnel assigned to the Clearance Section.

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

(1) GENERAL OVERALI PROCEDURES:

A - Generally the request for the preparation of a look-out card comes

from the Passport Office's (a)

Domestic Operations

Division, (b) Foreign

Operations Division, (c) Legal Division, and (d) the Department's Office

of Finance.

(a) Domestic Operations Division: Basically the Domestic

Operations Division (DO) handles all applications for passports

within the United States.

The application is generally received

in a passport agency, where it is reviewed by an adjudicator to

determine, among other things, whether or not it has been proper-

ly executed, and whether the applicant is seeking to travel in

where it is checked through the Clearance Section to determine

whether or not a look-out card exists. If one does not exist

the passport is issued routinely, if a card does exist the is-

suance of the passport is held in abeyance and the applicant's

passport file is reviewed prior to the issuance of the passport.

In cases where the application indicates a prior passport has

been issued and that it is potentially valid the agency requests

the applicant to present it for examination. If the passport has

expired the applicant is not requested to present it.

application indicates a desire to travel in countries for which

there are travel restrictions and the applicant persists in his

desire, a letter of explanation is requested and is forwarded to

the Department together with the application for determination.

Further, applications which raise a question of citizenship, loss

of citizenship, or a possibility of fraud are forwarded to the

Department for

decision. When such a question of citizenship

arises it is referred to a Senior Adjudicator who makes a deter-

mination.

If it is decided there is prima facie evidence indi-

cating a lack of citizenship or a loss of citizenship, a look-

out card is requested by preparing a refusal sheet.

The pur-

pose of the look-out card is primarily to serve as a "flag" or

an "alert" to the Passport Office. In the event a passport is

subsequently applied for it will not be issued routinely, but

a review of the applicant's file by a Senior Adjudicator will

then be made to determine whether or not a passport may be duly

issued.

(b) Foreign Operations Division: The Foreign Operations Division

(FO) receives for action, matters arising overseas relating to pass-

port and nationality matters.

However, It should be noted that only

"problem" cases are referred to FO for decision (8 FAM 245.6 speci-

fies what cases "must" be referred to the Department "for decision");

approximately 93 to 95% of all cases arising overseas are handled

by the overseas post concerned.

In cases referred to the Department,

if the adjudicator determines that there has been a loss of citizen-

ship or a failure to acquire citizenship a refusal sheet is prepared

requesting a look-out card.

Also, a card may be requested in any

case where

the adjudicator desires one to act as an "alert" or "flag".

That is, although there is no legal basis under existing regulations

and statutes for refusing or limiting a passport, it is felt, none-

theless, in the adjudicator's judgment, that a passport should not be

subsequently issued routinely.

This "flag" or "alert" insures, at

least, a review of the individual's passport file prior to the issu-

ance of a passport. Decisions for an "alert" or "flag" are based on

the adjudicator's experience and no definite criteria are established.

(c) Legal Division:

The Legal Division of the Passport Office

is composed of the Legal Advisory Branch (PT/LAD) and the Security

Branch (PT/LS). Generally PT/LAD is concerned with look-out cards

in cases which

involve passport frauds, imposters, child custody

cases and requests from other agencies for look-out cards.

is primarily concerned with Communist Party members, Communist sym-

pathizers, persons who have violated travel limitations, etc.

Branch receives reports from other agencies, which are disseminated

by INR. The majority of the reports come from the FBI with a small

portion from the CIA.

(INR records indicate that some 350 or more

reports are forwarded to the Passport Office each month. PT/LS

reviews the reports and if they indicate the individual is a Com-

munist Party member or a member of a Front Organization which im-

plies strongly the individual is a member of the Communist Party,

a look-out card is requested through the preparation of a refusal

sheet.

(a) Office of Finance: Within the Department the Office of

Finance (OF) also requests look-out cards when an individual has

been granted a repatriation loan.

The procedure requires that

when an individual executes an application for a repatriation loan

-4-

DocId:32213983

## Page 7

CONFIDENTIAL

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

the request is forwarded to the Special Consular Services (SCS) of

the Department for determination.

If the loan is approved, SCS so

advises the overseas post

and the loan is granted.

(It is not cus-

tomary for SCS to advise the Passport Office of their reasons for

granting the repatriation loan).

When the loan is granted, the

Consular Officer forwards a copy of the invoice to OF, on some oc-

casions the invoice would indicate the individual's date and place

of birth and name, and on others only the name.

These invoices

would then be forwarded to the Clearance Section of the Passport

Office and acted as a request for a look-out card. However, if

the loan did not exceed $50 and did not contain a date and place

of birth a card would not be prepared and it would be returned to

As a result, therefore, when an invoice did not indicate a

date and place of birth OF discontinued sending them to the Clear-

ance Section.

When an invoice did not contain the required infor-

mation the Clearance Section did prepare a look-out card and insert

It Into the look-out file.

Under current procedures the loan application is sent with

the invoice to OF by the overseas post and the date, place of

birth and the amount of the loan are readily available to oF.

The Clearance Section maintains the requirement of a date and

place of birth in order to insure positive identification when

a search is made and avoid possible embarrassment to the Depart-

ment by erroneous identification.

Further, under current pro-

cedures OF prepares its own IM look-out card and forwards it to

the Clearance Section for insertion in the look out file.

B - The Clearance Section of the Passport Office is that area where the

look-out file is maintained. When one of the areas under (A) above requests

a look-out card through the

preparation of a refusal sheet, under current pro-

cedures, the following steps are taken:

(a) The Senior Adjudicator or the Adjudicator preparing the

refusal sheet signs the sheet authorizing the request;

(b) a clerk within the Adjudicator's area prepares the look-

out card in duplicate, signs the refusal sheet and forwards the

sheet and the duplicate cards to the Clearance Section;

(c) the clerk within the Clearance Section receiving the

file with the refusal sheet and look-out cards performs the

following:

-5-

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

(1) indexes the refusal sheet;

(2) places one look-out card in the look-out file as

a temporary card and the other is stored for fu-

ture forwarding to prepare an IEM card. (When

the IBM card is received it replaces the tempor-

ary card and becomes the permanent card).

(3) When these steps have been performed the indivi-

dual performing them signs the refusal

sheet.

(4) The passport file is then forwarded to the Pass-

port Office files for storage or to a requesting

individual.

The indexing of the refusal sheet consists of the following: The indi-

vidual's name is typed along the right-hand margin of the refusal sheet by a

clerk designated to do so and, under the old system, the name preceded by the

number 130. Also, prior to the adoption of the current refusal sheet where

the signature of the clerk receiving the file and refusal sheet within the

Clearance Section is required, the indexing was the only evidence the re-

fusal sheet was received

a look-out card prepared by the Clearance Sec-

Moreover, the current refusal sheet was not in effect at the time

of the OSWALD look-out cards.

The number 130 was used as part of the State

Department's filing system.

Under that system numbers 130 to 149 were

assigned to the Passport files and 130 denoted the files which were filed

by an individual's name and not by subject matter; however, approximately

two years ago the Department's files were decentralized and the numbers

were dropped.

Prior to this current procedure the system generally required the re-

questing officer to execute a refusal sheet and forward it, with the file,

to the Clearance Section where a clerk indexed the refusal sheet and pre-

pared a look-out card. Under both systems if there was no request to re-

turn the file to a particular individual it would be forwarded to the Pass-

port files for filing.

Under the present procedures there is a record kept of the names of all

the persons taking action on the refusal sheet with regard to the look-out

card.

Under both

systems it is assumed that all proper action will be taken

during the ordinary course of business.

However, under neither system, pre-

sent or prior, is there any one particular individual vested with the respon-

sibility of checking to determine that all the ministerial steps required in

processing of a look-out card have been complied with.

C - The removal of the look-out cards is requested by those individuals

having authority to do so - generally an Adjudicator in FO or a Senior Adju-

dicator in DO.

In cases where a look-out card is requested for loss of citi-

zenship, lack of citizenship, or any case where there is no time limit placed

look-out card the request is made when evidence is received warranting

a reversal of the Adjudicator's prior decision. In such cases the Adjudicator

marks the refusal sheet "disregard", Indicates the reason for removal, and

The file and refusal sheet are forwarded to the Clearance

Section where the card is removed by the Chief of the Clearance Section or

someone designated by him. Prior to the adoption of this procedure there

was no formal record kept of the reason for removal of the look-out card

on the refusal sheet and the requesting officer did not sign his name on

the sheet. The refusal sheet was merely marked "disregard" and forwarded to.

the Clearance Section for removal of the look-out card.

With regard to the removal of look-out cards requested by outside agencies

this is accomplished when the requesting agency asks that it be removed.

where the card has a set expiration date the Clearance Section removes

1t automatically at the end of the period or shortly thereafter.

Look-out cards requested by OF are removed by the Clearance Section when

it is notified that the loan has been paid in full. OF sends a monthly list

of persons who have paid in full to the Clearance Section for removal of the

look-out cards.

Procedures in the Clearance Section dictate that the actual removal of

the card shall be accomplished by the Chief of the Section himself or his

designee.

(2) LEE HARVEY OSWALD CASE:

The OSWALD passport file was reviewed by the writer and it is noted

that the case was handled by the Foreign Operations Division.

Also, that

a refusal sheet was prepared; was apparently indexed, although not accord-

ing to standard procedures for indexing; and the refusal sheet was not marked

"disregard" - authority to remove the look-out card.

OSWALD applied for and

received a passport on or about June 25, 1963 at the Passport Agency in New

The New Orleans Passport Agency sent a TWX to Washington which,

among other names, listed OSWALD's name, but no information indicating a

prior passport was issued to him. OSWALD's 1963 application indicated de-

sired travel to Russia and Cuba.

Mr. Henry KUPIEK, Chief, PT/FEA, was interviewed and advised that cases

assigned to his Branch first came to

his desk, as Chier of the Branch, and

he assigned then to the Adjudicators according to their experience and abil-

1ty.

KUPIEK related he assigned the OSWALD case to Bernice WATERMAN (since

retired) who was at the time his Assistant and a most experienced Adjudicator.

Mrs. WATERMAN was interviewed and advised that she prepared a refusal

sheet requesting a look-out card for OSWALD in March of 1960. She continued,

saying that the purpose of a look-out card in the OSWALD case was not to re-

on 0o out are in

fuse him a passport in the future since he had not expatriated himself, but

was intended only as an "alert" or a "flag". Mrs. WATERMAN further stated

that she was only attempting to avoid the issuance of a passport routinely

In the event OSWALD should apply in the future. She added that she did not

mark the refusal sheet "disregard" when it was decided OSWALD had not in

fact expatriated himself because, as already indicated, she considered the

card a "flag". She stated it was her intention to leave the card in the file

indefinitely so that OSWALD's file would be reviewed by an Adjudicator prior

to the issuance of a passport to him in the future.

She related that once

she had executed a refusal sheet it would be forwarded to the Clearance Sec-

tion where a look-out card would be prepared and filed. She added, she did

not, nor was there any prescribed procedure, follow up her request in any

way to insure the card was prepared and filed, but assumed that all persons

i preparate one or c

concerned would perform their respective duties properly and a card prepared

and filed in the due course of business.

As indicated above, it appears from a review of the OSWALD refusal sheet

that at least an attempt was made to index the sheet which, if it had been

done, would have been followed by the preparation and filing of a look-out

-8-

card. It has been previously indicated that the usual procedure for index-

ing is one where the individual's name is typed along the right-hand margin

of the sheet preceded by the number 130. In the case of OSWALD, his name,

rather than typed, had been clearly printed by hand along the right-hand

margin and was not preceded by the number 130. Arthur M. COSTLEY, Evelyn

V. HALL, Alexander W. MAXWELL, Nanne BERREY, Dorothy CARTER, and Mary

RICHARDS (who is no longer with the Department) all of whom, at one time or

another about March 1960 prepared look-out cards, were interviewed and

shown a copy of the OSWALD look-out sheet.

All readily denied it was their

hand printing except Dorothy CARTER.

When shown the sheet CARTER immediate-

ly stated that the printing was hers, and when asked if she were positive,

she stated only that it looked very much like her hand printing.

(CARTER'S

statements were made in the presence of Henry KUPIEK). CARTER continued

saying that assuming the handwriting was hers it could safely be concluded

a look-out card was prepared and filed. However, CARTER had no personal

recollection of preparing or filing a look-out card in the OSWALD case nor

had she any recollection of removing the OSWALD card from the file.

with

regard to the fact that the number 130 did not precede OSWALD's name CARTER

could offer no explanation other than the possibility the refusal sheet may

have been indexed when the number 130 was dropped by the Passport Office.

In interviewing the various Passport Office personnel none could offer

any explanation as to what may have happened to the look-out card had one

been prepared.

The majority of the persons interviewed were of the opinion

that a card was never prepared because, among other reasons, the refusal

sheet was not indexed.

Mrs. WATERMAN, among others, offered the possible

explanation that the refusal sheet was buried under

subsequent correspond-

ence and, as a result, missed when the file reached the Passport files.

The general accepted procedure for removing a look-out card was des-

cribed as one where the Adjudicator marks the refusal sheet "disregard" and

forwards it to the Clearance Section for action. However, in interviewing

Alexander W. MAXWELL, Chief, Clearance Section, and Evelyn V. HALL, now

with RAF, it was determined

that in many cases the Adjudicator only sent

& "buck slip" to the Clearance Section requesting the removal of the card

and the refusal sheet in those cases apparently was not marked "disregard".

It appears from talking to MAXWELL and HALL that this was done more often

than not.

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

OSWALD was granted a repatriation loan on June 1, 1962. The repatriation

loan authorized by Special Consular Services (SCS) was granted on the authority

of 7 FAM 423.1-2 which states "b. The United States national is in or is the

cause of a situation which is damaging to the prestige of the United States

Government or which constitutes a compelling reason for extending assistance

to effect his return."

There does not appear to be anything in OSWALD's

passport file to indicate that the Passport Office was notified of SCS's

reasons for its decision that OSWALD came within the cited regulation. Since

the loan was granted on June 1, 1962, a look-out card should have been pre-

pared in June of 1962.

Leola B. BURKHEAD, ACD/RR was interviewed and advised that at the time

of the OSWALD loan the

procedure was to forward a copy of the loan invoice

to the Clearance Section where a look-out card was prepared. She advised

that since Passport would not prepare a card unless the name was accompanied

by a date and place of birth her office discontinued sending the invoices

BURKHEAD stated she definitely recalled forwarding the OSWALD

invoice to the Passport Office; that it was returned because it lacked a date

and place of birth; and that she as a result, threw it away. BURKHEAD stated

that she did not attempt to obtain OSWALD's date and place of birth and ac-

cording to MAXWELI of the Clearance Section, it was not the procedure for

the Clearance Section to attempt to obtain the information.

with regard to

BURKHEAD's certainty that she did in fact forward the OSWALD invoice to Pass-

port it should be noted that she was equally certain of the manner in which

OSWALD repaid his loan. She related that OSWALD made one payment of $100

and paid the balance in person at the Department.

The record clearly shows

OSWALD repaid his loan in seven installments by mail.

In interviewing various persons in the Domestic Operations Division,

including Virginia D. CARROLL, Vivian A. FERRIN, Margaret L. TATUM, and

Zella M. BRAZEAL, it appears that when an application for passport contains

something unusual it is referred to the Department by the Passport Agency

so that a prior file, if one exists, may be reviewed and a decision rendered.

All the individuals named above indicated that a potentially valid passport

in the naive cua1.e

(such as OSWALD's) which had been stamped for limited travel is the type of

case where the prior passport file would have been requested.

On June 25, 1963, or thereabouts, OSWALD applied at the New Orleans Pass-

port Agency for

a passport and indicated Russia and Cuba, among other places,

-10-

as countries he wished to visit. The application also indicated that he had

a prior passport (#1733242)

and

the application was marked "C & R" (cancelled

and returned). The "C & R" indicates that the Agency saw the passport, can-

celled it and returned it to OSWALD.

However, the TWX sent to the Department

does not indicate the passport was stamped for limited travel nor was any re-

quest made for the passport file.

(Correspondence in the passport file of

Lee Harvey OSWALD indicates Embassy Moscow was instructed by the Department

to restrict OSWALDIs passport to use for direct return to the United States.

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

(3) SECURITY SURVEY OF THE CLEARANCE SECTION:

The Clearance Section which maintains the Look-out File is housed in a

rectangular room with entrances from the 1800 corridor at 1811 and 1813.

Also, there are two doors within the room, one at the East wall connecting

it with room 1815 occupied by the Domestic Operations Division and another

at the West wall connecting it with room 1807 occupied by Foreign Operations

Division. The room is equipped with a Perimiter Control Security System.

All doors are equipped with magnetic contacts; all, except the main door

(1811) are equipped with security dead bolts; and the main door is fitted

with an soG model 50 pinch proof combination lock with dust cover.

The

room also has two windows on its North wall near the West corner which

are fitted with tapes and contacts.

the Security System is deactivated Monday through Friday between 7:00

am and 7:30 am and is activated between 5:30 pm and 6:00 pm; on Saturdays

it is deactivated between 8:30 am and 9:00 am and activated between 1:00

pm and 1:30 pm.

During all other times the security system is on and a

specified procedure must be followed to gain entrance into the room - only

those persons authorized to enter will be allowed to do so by the GSA

guards. If any of the four doors is opened other than as indicated above

there occurs a simultaneous annunciation, one at the Guard Office in the

Department and the other at the A.D.I. Central Station.

The West part of the room is occupied by the TWX Section and is sep-

arated by a glass partition with an opening in the center permitting free

access between the TWX Section and the Clearance Section.

A small area

on the Clearance Section side of the partition and near the South wall

Is occupied by the Recording Section of the Domestic Operations Division

which is composed of about three or four workers depending on their work

load. For the convenience of DO the security dead bolt on the East door

is left open during working hours to permit access between the Recording

Section of DO and the Adjudicator Section of DO. The other security dead

bolts are kept locked at all times.

With regard to the actual searching of the look-out files only those

persons assigned to the Section and those authorized by General Management

Instruction 1714.1 are permitted to search names through the files.

DO employees sharing space in room 1811 are not permitted to search the

files; however, the IWX employees are allowed to search when an urgent

TWX is received.

RECOMMENDATIONS

## Page 18

CONFIDENTIAL

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

(4) RECOMMENDATIONS:

A - It has been noted during this survey that no one particular indivi-

dual is vested with the responsibility of checking to see that all steps

necessary in the request, preparation, and insertion in the file of look-out

cards have been complied with prior to placing the case file in the files

for storage. In this regard the following are recommended:

(a) that the refusal

sheet be placed on the inside left cover

of the file where one exists, and in all other cases at the top

of all the correspondence both prior and subsequent;

(b) that the outside cover of the file be marked in such

a manner as to alert the file room personnel and all others

coming in contact with it, that the file contains a refusal

sheet;

(c) that responsible clerks be assigned to handle the

filing of these files, and they should be vested with the

responsibility of checking to see that all the signatures

required by the refusal sheet have been entered on it;

(d) if a refusal sheet does not bear all the necessary

signatures and notations the file should be returned to the

person or area requesting

the look-out card and it should

then be their responsibility to insure the necessary signa-

tures and notations are entered on the refusal sheet.

B - It is recommended that the refusal sheet be amended to include the

name of the person who physically removes the look-out card from the look-

out file, and the date of

such removal.

C - In making the recommendations immediately following it is realized

that a passport cannot be refused an individual for the sole reason that he

falls within one of the categories outlined.

However, they are offered, as

indicated earlier in this report, with the intent of

avoiding in the future

the routine issuance of a passport to a person coming within one of the spe-

cified categories without at least a review of the person's passport file,

and in some cases a check of the Office of Security indices.

In short, they

are suggested with the aim of preventing the routine issuance of passport to

a person with an "OSWALD" background.

(a) It is recommended that in all cases where the person

seeking a passport indicates a desire to travel behind the

Iron Curtain and evidence of a prior passport exists, the

individual's passport file be reviewed and his name checked

through indices of the Office of Security for possible CIA

or FBI information prior to the issuance of a passport.

(b) It is recommended that in all cases where a passport

stamped for limited travel is presented, the passport file

should be requested and reviewed prior to the issuance of a

passport.

(c) It is recommended that in all cases where an indivi-

dual has attempted to expatriate himself a look-out card should

be requested, prepared and filed. Also, if the individual should

apply in the

future for a passport the passport file should be

reviewed and his name checked through the indices of the Office

of Security for the reason as indicated under (a) above.

(d) It is recommended that in all cases where a repatria-

tion loan is granted because the applicant for the loan comes

within the purview of 7 FAM 423.1-2 (the person is involved in

a situation damaging to U. S. prestige), the Passport Office

be advised of the facts surrounding SCS's decision.

(e) It is recommended that in all cases where the Passport

Office is apprised as recommended in the preceding paragraph (d)

a look-out card be requested, prepared and filed in the name of

the individual.

(f) If the pertinent regulations do not already so state,

it is recommended they be amended making it mandatory for the

overseas post granting the loan to forward a copy of the loan

application together with the invoice to the Office of Finance.

D - The Security of the Clearance Section as described above is believed

to be adequate.

However, it is felt that access into the Clearance

Section

during working hours should be more closely controlled. In this regard the

following

are recommended:

tion

be required to have their Identification Cards visibly dis-

(5) SUMMARY OF SY/FILES:

The Security files of personnel assigned temporarily or permanently to

the Clearance Section were reviewed by Special Agent Robert J. FUREY and

the writer.

However, the Security files reviewed were limited to files of

personnel assigned to the Section from January 1960 through August of 1961,

and March 1962 through August of 1963, the periods when a look-out card,

if one had been prepared, would have

been on file for OSWALD.

The first

period covers the span when OSWALD attempted to expatriate himself until

the Department's decision that he had not in fact expatriated himself,

and the second period extends from the granting of the repatriation loan

until the final payment and slightly beyond.

Approximately 140 files were

reviewed (the list of names was supplied by the Passport Office) and fol-

lowing is a summary of the files containing derogatory information of a

more serious nature:

Bruno William KORSAK: He was accused of making statements,

while at Embassy Bonn, that he was "a confirmed Communist"

and that he "would probably go to Moscow and never return".

KORSAK stated the statements were made in jest. While in

Germany he was intimate with an East German girl. He ad-

mitted to excessive drinking. Also, he reportedly attempted

to rape a "CAS" employee, but denied it when questioned.

PER/MED advised they believed KORSAK to be a security risk

under EO 10450.

William I, GRIER:] It was stated that a picture of Nikita

KHRUSHCHEV was, observed hanging on the wall of a room

occupied by] GRIER and two others.

Cleveland Oatman Da COSTA: He was described as a follower

of STALIN with an extensive knowledge of Marxist Doctrine;

has expressed himself as being anti-American and praises

the Soviet Union; is an admirer of Paul ROBESON; has dis-

tributed pro-Soviet pamphlets, printed by the Council on

African Affairs which is cited by the Attorney General as

subversive and communist; attempted to organize a Canal

Zone Branch of the International Progressive Negro Youth

Congress during 1950.

(Wliam I, MATONE! He was accused of engaging In extra-marital

relations with Department employees.

While in the U. S. Army

he wrote to Paul ROBESON soliciting

his aid in marrying a Ger,

man national - he stated the letter was not answered. MALONE]

attempted to enlist the aid of Senator JAVITS and Representa-

tive BLAKELY on his behalf implying he was victim of discrim-

ination. JAVITS and BLAKELY withdrew their support when ap-

prised of the facts in the case.

Irvin Bennett ROSENSTEIN: His wife has a paternal uncle, Sidney

SHUPAK, who has been accused by the wife's family of being a

Communist and has been ostracized by the family.

HUA records

indicate one Sidney SHUPAK signed a petition in 1950 protest-

ing the shipment of arms to the Chinese Nationals, and served

as Chairman of the 5th Congressional District of the Progres-

sive Party In Philadelphia.

William Nelson POINDEXTER, JIa: Listed as a personal refer-

ence a former teacher and neighbor, Mr. Van Dyke WALKER, whose

name appeared on the mailing list of the Progressive Party of

the District of Columbia in 1955.

[Wilbert Henry GRAY:] A former employer questioned his honesty.

Milton LEE: LEE had a serious record of bad credit and was of-

Iered an opportunity to resign in lieu of charges.

He admitted

being party to a scheme to obtain money under false pretences.

Also, he listed Dammon A. FLEMONS as a reference (see name below).

Dammon A. FLEMONS! FLEMONS|has had bad credit from the date

of his entrance on duty with the Department in 1956 up to and

including this year. ELEMONS]listed Milton LlEjabove as a

reference.

Valerie Regina JOHNSON aka Valerie Regina MOXO:] She gave birth

to a child out of wedlock fathered by a Southern

Rhodesian na-

tional, Charles MOYO, who has returned to Africa. Also, some

people questioned her emotional stability.

It appears

she was

friendly with a Madelyn FREUND]who planned to marry an Ethio-

pian national who at one time was reportedly attached to the

Ethiopian Embassy.

John Albert JONES:] While enrolled in the R.O.I.C. program he re-

Tused to sign a loyalty oath. He has, however, denied membership

in any subversive organizations.

Richard Bruce KURTICH:] A doctor advised the Office of Security

that there existed the possibilityLKURTICH may be dangerous.

The doctor officially stated subject bas a

"character disorder"

and unofficially he indicated KURtICh is a psychopath and des

cribed him as "thoroughly rotten". KURTICH admitted to homo-

sexual activity and being friendly with|kenneth E. GARY listed

below. Resigned in lieu of charges.

/Eugene PALMORE: His father, Jefferson PALMORE signed a Commu-

hist Party election petition in 1940.

This was admitted by the

father but he denied knowing what it was.

Frederick J. BLACHLY:] PER/MED advised BLACHLY]should be given

a psychiatric evaluation, however, he transferred to AID prior

to the evaluation.

Alexander W. MAXWELL: Although no derogatory information as

such appears, the file reflects that he was discharged from

the military service in 1943, the height of World War II, be-

cause he did not possess the required attributes to become an

officer.

Douglas Bruce UTHUS: | No derogatory information concerning LUTHUS.

However, his father was investigated by the fBl for possible

fraud against the Government

while performing his duties with

the War Assets Administration; for representing himself as a

procurer of Government contracts; and for failure to register

under the Registration Act as a Foreign Agent.

In each case

there was no prosecution by the Department of Justice.

The files of James TULLY, Kenneth Edward GARY, Herbert W.

KUEHNE, Fox Gregg BENJAMIN, Harry M. HANDLEY, Carl dO PRIESTLAND,

and Carl R. HAGEN contain information of a serious nature regard-

ing homosexual activity.

The look-out card process cÃ¡n be divided into two categories, (a)

one

which can be referred to as the judicial aspect and (b) the ministerial as-

The first category concerns itself with the basis or criteria used

in determining whether or not a card shall be requested.

The second cate-

gory concerns itself with the mechanical steps involved in preparing a

look-out card from the time a decision to request a card is made until the

filing of the card. Since the purpose of this study is primarily concerned

with the procedures in handling the look-out cards, emphasis will be placed

on the ministerial aspect of the look-out card process with reference to

the judicial aspect primarily for reasons of background. Furthermore, any

recommendations at the conclusion of this report, which can be said to fall

within the judicial realm of the process, are offered not as criteria for

refusing a passport, but only as a means of avoiding the routine issuance

of a passport to an

individual with a questionable background. Moreover,

the study was confined to inquiries to determine how the look-out cards

are handled in a typical "OSWALD" case and specifically the procedures

followed in the Lee Harvey OSWALD case itself.

This study is broken down

into the following categories: (1) the general overall procedures, (2)

the Lee Harvey OSWALD case, (3) security survey of the Clearance Section,

(4) recommendations, and (5) summary of SY/Files having derogatory infor-

mation relating to personnel assigned to the Clearance Section.

(3) SECURITY SURVEY OF THE CLEARANCE SECTION:

The Clearance Section which maintains the Look-out File is housed in a

rectangular room with entrances from the 1800 corridor at 1811 and 1813.

Also, there are two doors within the room, one at the East wall connecting

it with room 1815 occupied by the Domestic Operations Division and another

at the West wall connecting it with room 1807 occupied by Foreign Operations

Division.

The room is equipped with a Perimiter Control Security System.

All doors are equipped with magnetic contacts; all, except the main door

(1811) are equipped with security dead bolts; and the main door is fitted

with an S&G model 50 pinch proof combination lock with dust cover.

The

room also has two windows on its North wall near the West corner which

are fitted with tapes and contacts.

The Security System is deactivated Monday through Friday between 7:00

am and 7:30 am and is activated between 5:30 pm and 6:00 pm; on Saturdays.

it is deactivated between 8:30 am and 9:00 am and activated between 1:00

pm and 1:30 pm. During all other times the security system is on and a

specified procedure must be followed to gain entrance into the room - only

those persons authorized to enter will be allowed to do so by the GSA

guards.

If any of the four doors is opened other than as indicated above

there occurs a simultaneous annunciation, one at the Guard Office in the.

Department and the other at the A.D.T. Central Station.

The West part of the room is occupied by the TWX Section and is sep-

arated by a glass partition with an opening in the center permitting free

between the TWX Section and the Clearance Section.

on the Clearance Section side of the partition and near the South wall

is occupied by the Recording Section of the Domestic Operations Division

which is composed of about three or four workers depending on their work

For the convenience of DO the security dead bolt on the East door

is left open during working hours to permit access between the Recording

Section of DO and the Adjudicator Section of DO. The other security dead

bolts are kept locked at all times.

With regard to the actual searching of the look-out files only those

persons assigned to the Section and those authorized by General Management

Instruction 1714.l are permitted to search names through the files.

DO employees sharing space in room 181l are not permitted to search the

files; however, the TWX employees are allowed to search when

an urgent

TWX is received.

CONFIDENTIAL

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

(a) It is recommended that in all cases where the person

seeking a passport indicates a desire to travel behind the

Iron Curtain and evidence of a prior passport exists, the

individual's passport file be reviewed and his name checked

through indices of the Office of Security for possible CIA

or FBI information prior to the issuance of a passport.

(b) It ig recommended that in all cases where a passport

stamped for limited travel is presented, the passport file

should be requested and reviewed prior to the issuance of a

passport.

(c) It is recommended that in all cases where an indivi-

dual has attempted to expatriate himself a look-out card should

be requested, prepared and filed.

Also, if the individual should

apply in the

future for

a passport the passport file should be

reviewed and his name checked through the indices of the Office

of Security for the reason as indicated under (a) above.

(d) It is recommended that in all cases where

a repatria-

tion loan is granted because the applicant for the loan comes

within the purview of 7 FAM 423.1-2 (the person is involved in

a situation damaging to U. S. prestige), the Passport Office

be advised of the facts surrounding SCS's decision.

(e) It is recommended that in all cases where the Passport

Office is apprised as recommended in the preceding paragraph (a)

a look-out card be requested, prepared and filed in the name of

the individual.

(f) If the pertinent regulations do not already so state,

it is recommended they be amended making it mandatory for the

overseas post granting the loan to forward a copy of the loan

application together with the invoice to the Office of Finance.

D - The Security of the Clearance Section as described above is believed

to be adequate. However, It is felt that access into the Clearance Section

during working hours should be more closely controlled. In this regard the

following are recomnended:

tion be required to have their Identification Cards visibly dis-

played on

their persons during all working hours.

OSWALD, Lee Harvey

(5) SUMMARY OF SY/FILES:

The Security files of personnel assigned temporarily or permanently to

the Clearance Section were reviewed by Special Agent Robert J. FUREY and

the writer. However, the Security files reviewed were limited to files of

personnel

assigned to the Section from January 1960 through August of 1961,

and March 1962 through August of 1963, the periods when a look-out card,

if one had been prepared, would have been on file for OSWALD.

The first

period covers the span when OSWALD attempted to expatriate himself until

the Department's decision that he had not in fact expatriated himself,

and the second period extends from the granting of the repatriation loan

until the final payment and slightly beyond. Approximately 140 files were

reviewed (the list of names was supplied by

the Passport Office) and fol-

lowing is a summary of the files containing derogatory information of a

more serious nature:

Bruno William KORSAK: He was accused of making statements,

while at Embassy Bonn, that he was "a confirmed Communist"

and that he "would probably go to Moscow and never return".

KORSAK stated the statements were made in jest.

While in

Germany he was intimate with an East German girl. He ad-

mitted to excessive drinking. Also, he reportedly attempted

under EO 10450.

William I. GRIER:] It was stated that a picture of Nikita

S. KHRUSHCHEV was observed hanging on the wall of a room

occupied by GRIER and two others.

Cleveland Oatman Da COSTA: He was described as a follower

of STALIN with an extensive knowledge of Marxist Doctrine;

has expressed himself as being anti-American and praises

the Soviet Union; is an admirer of Paul ROBESON, has dis-

tributed pro-Soviet pamphlets, printed by the Council on

African Affairs which is cited by the Attorney General as

subversive and communist; attempted to organize a Canal

Zone Branch of the International Progressive Negro Youth

Congress during 1950.

His father, Jefferson PALMORE signed a Commu-

nist Party election petition In 1940. This was admitted by the

father but he denied knowing what it was.

Frederick J. BLACHLY:] PER/MED advised BLACHLY should be given

a psychiatric evaluation, however, he transferred to AID prior

to the evaluation.

Alexander We MAXWELL: Although no derogatory information as

such appears, the file reflects that he was discharged from

the military service in 1943, the height of World War II, be-

cause he did not possess the required attributes to become an

officer.

Douglas' Bruce UTHUS:

No derogatory Information concerning UTHUS.

However, his father was investigated by the FBl for possibie

fraud against the Government while performing his duties with

the War Assets Administration; for representing himself as a

procurer of Government contracts; and for failure to register

under the Registration Act as a Foreign Agent.

In each

case

there was no prosecution by the Department of Justice.

The files of James TULLY, Kenneth Edward GARY, Herbert W.

KUEHNE, Fox Gregg BENJAMIN, Harry M. HANDLEY, Carl J. PRIESTLAND,

and Carl R. HAGEN contain information of a serious nature regard-

ing homosexual activity.
