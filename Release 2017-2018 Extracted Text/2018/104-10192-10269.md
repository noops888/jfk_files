organization in tis province. A few men in each mcvenent naintein this
fiction of the existence of their organizations.

Matanzas Province. This provincs hes been used by the soveuents as &

route for the entrance ani exit of sen ant military equiment. The pointe
tsed ere wales careful watch, end the personnel doing this work has besn
recmei to rethirg. The HAR, MOC, MAP, and, to a lesser extent, the

30 de Koriesre have civilian arganizations with little or no effectivensss«

Habana Troriace. Provincial organizations practically do not exist, since

ef which are-in the City of Habana, The men of tha first, socond, and even
third rank axe, in alnost all cases, either prisouers, in asylun,or in exile.
Those who survive have succeeded because of the co-operation of those who,

G) Escanbray Front. The three best-known loaders of this front are
Osvalio Ramirez, Congo Pacheco, and Tancho Villa. There 1s no discipline
among the groups, ani the frout is very disorganized. It is estimated
that the mumber of insurgents does not exceed 300, lacting arms and
having little food. Sanire:' reputation anong the ler class 1s good

The centers of supply af fool ant mmitions, such as Placetes, Sancti

many arrests. It da predadle that this front will not grow because of
