MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Examination of a Portion of the Records of Richard Helms

On March 13, 1975, I requested that Hank Knoche locate and make
available for the staff's inspection all of the following documents
maintained by Richard Helms or his secretary during the period
between his appointment as DDP and the date of his separation from
the Agency: .

Desk calendars

Phone logs

Appointment logs

Diaries

Chronological correspondence files

Tape recordings of meetings and phone’ conversations as well
as any transcriptions thereof

File memoranda.

On the day I presented my request, Knoche explained that at the time

of his departure from the Agency, Helms "tidied up!" his personal

files and that a substantial amount of material may have been destroyed.
Knoche believes that most of the tape recordings of the DCI's phone
conversations and meetings in his office were among the items
destroyed. He added that the Agency has no record of what was
destroyed but that the most productive source of that information would
be Elizabeth C. Dunlevy, who was Helms' secretary at the time, and
who has now retired from the Agency but resides in the Washington
area. Knoche stated that he would make every effort to locate all of
the documents in the above categories which are still within the custody
of the Agency.

On March 14, Knoche informed me that he had assembled two full boxes
of Mz. Helms’ records which would be available on Monday in the office -
of the Inspector General. On March 18, I obtained the documents from &

Scott Breckinridge who expressed doubt that anyone at the Agency
had previously examined them in connection with the Watergate
related investigations or the Commission's investigation.

The documents fall into three basic categories which are as follows:

1. Desk calendars (1965 through March 1973), The Inspector
General delivered these to me and described them as "Helms’ desk
calendars". However, before the Senate Select Committee on
Presidential Campaign Activities, Mrs. Dunlevy testified that she
destroyed his calendars around the time of his departure from the
Agency. She further testified that she maintained her own calendar
of his appointments and travel plans and it appears that it is her
calendars for 1965 through March of 1972 that have survived. I
checked these materials only for names and dates of interest to Bill
Schwarzer and myself and suggest that if any of you wish to verify
meetings of importance to your subject areas, you examine these
documents yourselves or make out a list of items which Pete Clapper
could check. The documents remain at our disposal in eight manila
envelopes in one of the safes at our offices at CIA Headquarters (i
have the combination. ) .

2. Helms' Chronological Correspondence Files (1965 through
March 1973). These files are contained in eleven (ll) hard-cover
file folders, the titles of which are set forth below. 1 examined
each ofthese files in its entirety in an effort to locate documents
which might be of interest to our respective groups. Accordingly,
I do not recommend that’ any of you take the time to make an inde- {
pendent examination of these files. In the following pages, listed
below the title of each of the correspondence files, you will find a
brief identification of those documents which appeared te me to have
some relevance to our inquiry (I have probably erred on the side of
over-inclusion), I have also bookmarked the files with white pieces
of paper in an effort to facilitate your finding any documents you
wish to examine.

a, '1965-DD/P Chrono + DDCI"

- Helms' memorandum dated 7 December 1965 describing
telephone conversation between Helms and Sullivan re
FBI-CIA relations. In particular, the memorandum deals
with apparent FBI dissatisfaction over CIA activity in con-
nection with project BOURBON,

Helms' memorandum for Bill Moyers dated 9 June 1965
enclosing a document describing the Agency's "efforts to
do something constructive in the student field on behalf of
United States foreign policy." The enclosure is a particu-
larly unusual document in which it is difficult to determine
whether Helms is using cryptonyms for the actual names.
lf he was using cryptonyms, they were poorly chosen and,
if not, the document appears to describe domestic involve-
ment in the New York area at a time well in advance of the
Ober Project. Among the institutions, organizations and
individuals mentioned in the memorandum are Columbia
University, Adelphi College, the AFL-CIO, the John Birch
Society, and Senators Dodd and Towers.

a, taping in embassies
b. snatch

cs, RCA-ITT

d, "UR. HELMS-DCI-Chrono-1967!' (Jan-July)

- There are a number of documents in this file that indicate
that Helms or his secretary maintained a phone log. For
example, there are a series of docurnents identifying all
calls Helms made to certain newsmen during 1966 and 1967
including Reston, Wicker and Wells. These documents
appear to have been compiled sometime in late 1967. The
file also contains a list of all phone calls made to Helms
by the President during 1965 and 1967. I will pursue this
possibility with Elizabeth Dunlevy and inform you of the
results. . ,

The file contains a series of documents apparently directed
to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in May 1962. The
first document in the group is a Memorandum for Attorney
General Kennedy from Lawrence R. Houston dated 15 May
1962 and reading as follows;

Publication or Use of Communications." This memo appears
to have been requested by the Attorney General after an oral

between August 1960 and May 1961."

Attorney General had apparently heard nothing of President
Nixon's instructions with respect to domestic intelligence
until that morning. Helms adds that Mitchell also appeared
to have no knowledge of the 5 June 70 meeting with respect
to the Huston Plan which was chaired by the FBI,

states that "this is the monthly report on subject which you

information with respect to the President's brother which
is attributed to a reliable source.

The memorandum also reflects that Helms informed Gray

he requested that the Bureau confine itself to persons already =

their inquiry into other areas that might eventually run afoul of tng

CIA operations. &

a. "R, Helms - Memos for Record! (1951-64) ie
i

- "Memorandum for Record" dated 24 June 1964, subject of
which was "Talk with Chief Justice Earl Warren". This
memorandum and several others in closé proximity describe
meetings between Helms and members and staff of the
Warren Commission (including "David Belin of Treasury")
with respect to the Commission's use of certain information
provided by the Russian defector Nosenko. The group looking
into possible CIA connections with the Kennedy assassination
may be interested in reading these documents although they
appear to me to raise no significant questions.

b. 'R, Helms - 1965 ~ Memos for Record (1965-1972)"

There appear to be no significant documents in this file but

it should be noted that while there are numerous memoranda
for the record in the earlier years, there is only one docurnent
for 1972. In that document, during a meeting with Helms in
early 1972, John Ehrlichman expresses concern that Henry
Kissinger is copying classified documents apparently for use
in his writing when and if he returns to the academic life.
