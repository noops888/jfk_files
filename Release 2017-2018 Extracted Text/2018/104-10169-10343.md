F'2, It should be noted that a considerable proportion of the "take®
during Kay was shot at the Trattnerhof in an effort to secure photographic
coverage of USIA officials. It is our hope that it will. be possible some~
time during the near future to show all the Trattnerhof photographs taken
to date (and no more will be taken fron now on) to DS 623, If we succeed
in this objective, we shall of course report the results to Headquarters
without delay. You will-further note that the photographs Nos. G 32.2 p
through G 32,13 are not transmitted with the attached. Theso prints are :
mow. available only in single copy, and will be transmitted after they are

+ ghown to DS 623, Additional copies of this series were not printed, since
in general they were of relatively poor suitability for identification work.

dmprovenent, roth technically and with respect to successful coverage of
targets of interest, ovor that transmitted along with the reference. At

\Uthe present tine, GRITOMIC 1 coverage of sensitive areas is being temporarily
suspended, both in order to avoid burning him through overuse and because,
