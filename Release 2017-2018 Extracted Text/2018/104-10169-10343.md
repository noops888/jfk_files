LAYA -22529, 25 August 2955

Transnitted herewith are 407 clandestine photographs taken by

CHATOMIC I during the month of May 1955.

All of then wore taken with the

"chest canara" described in the reference and previous correspondence.

The numbering sygten is the same as and a direct continustion of that used

for the 1a1t1al CRITONIC I photographs transmitted with the reference.

"'2. It should be noted that a considerable proportion of the "take"

during Kay was shot at the Trattnerhof in an offort to secure photographic

coverage of USIA officials.

It 15 our hope that it will be possible some

time during the near future to show all the Trattnerhof photographs taken

to dato (and no more will be taken fron noi on) to D$ 623.

In this objoctive, we shall of course report the results to headquartera

athout delay.

You will further note that the photographs Nos. G 32.1

through & 32.13 are not transmitted with the attached.

These prints are

nos avallable only in single copy, and vill be transnitted after they are

showa to DS 623.

Additional copies of this series were not printed, since

In general they were of relatively poor suitability for identification work.

3. In general, it 18 felt that the coverage during May shows a distinet

Improvement, roth technically and with respect to successiul coverago of

targets of interest..

over that transmitted along with the reference.

suspended,

We intend, as the post
