MEMORANDUM FOR:

Chief, External Activities Branch

Office of Security

:

John H. Stein

Deputy Chief,,

. Soviet/East European Division.

:

Manuscript by David Phillips.

1. At the risk of tilting continually at windmills, it

is the undersigned's view.

and that of innumerable colleagues,

that Mr. Phillips' book should not be published.

In the first

instance, those portions we have read are superficial and give

the reader the impression that the profession which Mr. Phillips

practiced so well is one of derring-do, frivolity and foolishness.

More seriously, the entire book is based on knowledge acquired

by Mr. Phillips during his career in the Agency.

Whether a

in eat pee time pant entity at, sentenceps

If publish Mr. Phillips must, and if the Agency cannot legally

stop him,

then so be it. Hopefully, while there is still time,

someone will push for appropriate legislation to stop this

foolishness.

2.

While it is perhaps fruitless, we have attempted to

identify some of the more damaging items in the text as

drafted. These are cited below:

use of women

by the DDo.

While I understand

Mr. Phillips' desire to indicate that the DDO does in

fact hire women and minorities,

this section causes

some anguish.

At the present time, certainly in the

•use of women provides us an operational

flexibility

which we would not otherwise have.

It is quite

evident, furthermore, that the local security services

have not focused

on the extent to which we do use

We would like to keep it that way as long

we possibly can, and it is the undersigned's firm

belief that statements from Mr. Phillips, obviously

authentic, will rather quickly bring the women we do

use under

increased

scrutiny of hostile intelligence

services.

Further, in opening the Pandora's box of

the use of women and

minorities in the DDO, Mr. Phillips

may be opening both himself and the Do to unjustified

criticism that we are either exploiting women or not

hiring

enough of them; similarly the minorities.

Page 25: I have known personally for 17 years

the girl who, although stripped naked by burglars,

managed to save her mother and father from harm.

There

are others elsewhere in the government and probably

outside who

are knowledgeable about the incident.

The

girl, now a lovely lady, is about to be dispatched under

very sensitive cover abroad. Mr. Phillips would do well

to

delete reference to her

as being an Agency employee.

Page 26: I think it is unwise for Mr. Phillips

to conjecture on the reason why there are few blacks

employed in the DDO. His reasoning may be correct,

but I would venture that not everyone who reads his

book will believe

so, and

the Agency may come under

unfortunate pressure

because of it. The specific

black cited on page 27 as having removed a flag from

the hands of demonstrators is a personal friend of

He is under cover. By citing the incident,

Mr. Phillips removes that cover, for the black re-

trieved the flag as an American

citizen, not as a CIA

officer.

In sum, I would suggest the deletion of the

involving

women and minorities because it

opens a

Pandora's box and because

as written, the

cover of two highly effective officers is placed in

jeopardy.
