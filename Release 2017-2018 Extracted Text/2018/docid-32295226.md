Miami letter dated July 31, 1964 set forth the

following:

The information set forth below is the result

of contact with confidential informant CG 6538-C-TE,

on larch 19, and March 25,

1964, at Miami, Florida.

• In

view of the

lact that this informant is intimately involved

in the information which he has furnished, it is requested

that this information be placed on the Administrative pages

of the report and not in the

details.

Informant is now involved

full time on the

"Calypso Liner" Cruise Boat operating between Miami,

Florida, and Bimini, Bahamas, B.W. I.

His full time

partner

in this venture is FRANK MILLER, previously described by the

informant as "bag man" for Broward County SO. In addition,

informant has agreed to pay DOMINIC DIBELLA one-half of his,

Informant's, share which will go toward retirement of his

debt

to the ROSS PRIO Organization,

As was stated earlier,

this venture is a modified version of the "Razzle Dazzle,"

with

the exception that prizes are given in the form of

perfume, cameras, watches, etc.

These prizes, however,

may be exchanged

for cash, which is usually the case:

HENRY

DUBBINS,

operator of the "Calypso," has issued specific

instructions to informant that the game must be run in

such a manner as to not cause heat to be brought to bear

by irate victims, and as a result, the game is quasi-.

legitimate.

Informant is now in a position whereby he has

saved $1, 100 for DIBELLA, which will be given to him upon

his next trip to Miami, which will be momentarily.

Informant states there was a considerable amount

PRANK HERNANDEZ, DUBAILS Propresentatith th ge at, that one

representative on the boat, was

suspicious of the informant and FRANK MILLER and passed on

these suspicions to DUBBINS, stating that informant was

under investigation by the Government. DUBBINS passed this

on to informant,

and finally

admitted to informant that

HERNANDEZ just did not care for the informant.

Informant

discussed the situation with MILLER and DOMINIC DIBELLA,

who instructed informant to tell HERNANDEZ that if he did

not "sit still" he, HERnanDeZ, would be "hit."

DIBELLA

told informant he

received the go ahead to say this from

ROSS PRIO.

Informant relates that after this original difficulty,

he and HERNANDEZ have an

"understanding" so that he is now

on friendly terms with him. HERNANDEZ has told informant

that he has worked in the past with and for SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

both in Miami and in Cuba. He did not indicate the present

relationship between himself and TRAFFICANTE, but tried to

leave the impression that a degree of relatonship does

exist.

The informant advised on April 9, 1964, that FRANK

HERNANDEZ, previously mentioned as being closely associated

with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, recently made a trip to New York

with BERT DUBBIN for the purpose of making arrangements

to work on

the new liner being purchased by DUBBIN, the

"Italia," to be docked off of Freeport, Bahamas.

FRANK

MILLER told the Informant that TRAFFICANTE advised MILLER

during a

previous meeting that if anything should happen

to FRANK HERNANDEZ, the same thing would happen to the

individual responsible, apparently referring to the veiled

threats by the informant concerning the help of HERNANDEZ.

From Information in Miami files, it appears very

reasonable that SANTO TRAFFICANTE and BENJAMIN H. GOLOB

are acquainted with each other but it appears that GOLOB

is more an associate and business confidant of

ANGELO

BRUNO than subject.

Departmental Attorney WILLIAM S. KENNEY, with

woom daison Is maintained by the miami Office, has

furnished no additional information regarding ANTONIO

IBARRO, previously

reported as allegedly being a half-

brother of the subject.

With regard to the individual known as "Chopper"

previously referred to as an errand boy for SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

it is believed by the Miami Office that this most likely

refers to MACHO GENER whose description approximates that of

There is also a man named FREEMAN Or FRIEDMAN,

who,

according to informant, looks like an Italian Jew.

He has some connection with the casino but the connection

is not known to the informant

On January 10, 1964, TP. P-2 advised that he talked

with MACHO GENER and GENER told him that EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL

and EUGENIO: LEAL are running a gambling casino in Santo

Domingo.

TP T-2 was of the opinion that SANTO TRAFFICANTE

was backing the above pair and säid he would question GENER

more if the opportunity arises

On January 14 & 24, 1964, IP T-2 advised that he

had talked again to MACHO GENER who told him that LEAL was

definitely in the casino at Santo Domingo and was running the

casino.

VIDAL, however, was known by GENER to still be in

the Miami area.

On January 8, 1964, TP T-3 advised that he had learned

that EUGENIO LEAL is operating in the casino located in the

old Hotel La Paz in Santo Domingo

This casino is the Pan

Americana and he is alleged to be backed in this operation

by his old friend SANTO TRAFFICANTE.

On January 2, 1964, TP T-3 overheard GODOFREDO

ECHEMENDIA, brother of OSCAR ECHEMENDIA, bragging about the

nanctal holdings of his family GODOFREDO, who is commonly

called GODO, said that the bar in the Senate Hotel, 139 NE

2nd Avenue, next to the Hong Kong Restaurant belongs to his

brother RAFAEL ECHEMENDIA and that their family has other businesses

such as gas station and garage on Nw 36th Street, Miami,

Florida

Informant advised that he encountered MACHO GENER

on May 6, 1964, at Flagler and SW 8th Avenue:

He said that

GENER had been very preoccupled because his automobile had

been robbed and a bank envelope containing various documents

was

stolen from his car.

The said that in this envelope were:

two letters from Santo Domingo which he would very mich like

to find, because they contain important information.

He said

he would offer a good reward to anyone who could locate the

Letters.

GENER said that SANTO TRAFFICANTE was very disgusted

because he is constantly being persecuted by the FBI and

cannot make a move without hiding his every movement so he

will not be followed.

GENeR, after talking a little while, said that he

had to leave and go to his house because he had a date with

an Italian friend of whom he has talked about to the informant

before. GENER has said that this Italian friend of his will

be able to find some work for the informant.

The informant advised that he followed GENER in

his own car at a distance to Miami Beach where GENER got

out and went into the Hotel Colonial, 730 Ocean Drive.

Intormant saw him go, into this hotel and waited for two

hours to see if GNER came out of the hotel with anybody, he

knew

He did not observe anybody on this stake but on a

subsequent date he went to the vicinity of the hotel and

observed a man leaving the hotel

with a dark complected woman

who he believes to be his wife and he believes

that both are

Living at the Colonial Hotel.
