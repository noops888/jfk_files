From: J. Barry Harrelson, CSI/HRG
Subject: Meeting with ARRB Staff
1. Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell, ‘

Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,
Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four
releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had
been identified as potential appeal items, dnd on the at
Agency's.concerns re the documents. I requested
that the Board reconsider the release of the statements on

Mexico City political action programs elso's comment on
Agee, the reference to thd | as_a_source jand
as site of the Agency's Record Center.

2. Marwell agreed to send a “staff recommendation” to
the Board recommending that they delay the release of these
four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency. The
rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be
released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's
recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next
Washington meeting (27 September). If the Board rejects the
staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing
to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that
the Board would agree to delay the release.

3. Gunn requested that the Agency's additional
evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to
tHE SARRB staff by 23 September. The Agency can also brief
the Board members at the 27 September meeting. As I
understand it, DO/Mexico jwill be preparin
evidence memos _on “political action proarams” andl

q

a }issues and OGC |will take the lead on
Agee. I will contact the DA/IRO on the
issue. ss :

4. Concerning the ene re Hocuments, Marwell agreed
to delay Board action unti € October meeting. The
Agency's proposal on these documents should be sent to the
ARRB staff as soon as possible.
