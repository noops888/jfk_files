B.

The drying up of the ball point pens in the B-10,

Dial Recordor has beon a constant nuisance aince

the beginaing of thie operation. The pressure

menaltive tape was the obvlous answer to thie

problem, but the firet ten rolls of pressure

tape were received after nearly four years ol

struggling with the defective pens. It le

recommended that pressuro sensitive tape be

supplied to thia operation for future use.

C. The tea rolle of pressure sensitive tape

received during this IDY were wound back-

warde on their apindles.

D. The tires on the idler wheel of the B-10 are

drying and cracking and fail to obtain adequate

traction on the flywheel. This causes tapo

feed problems. It is recommended that three

dosen new idler wheele ba pouched to AREMART

Immediately, Several of the defective idles

wheels are avallable in this offien for

The Rapack! Plan

1.

The Polish proposal for a Central European

nuclear-free zone was introduced

at the 2 October 1957

session of the UN General Assembly

by the Polish Foreign

Minister, Adam

Rapackl.

Acting as spokesman for the

Polish

Government, he formulated the proposal:

both East and West Germany agree to a ban on the produc-

tion and

Poland

storage of nuclear weapons on their territories,

would

simultaneously introduce an identical ban on

her territory.

Rapackt did not mention Czechoslovakia,

but the head

of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking

after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his

country

would join the agreement,

extending the

her

territory,

East Germans subsequently varols

endorsed the

Rapacki's proposal

had obviously been cleared and

coordinated with Soviet leaders prior to its

introduction.

Moscow promptly reported the proposal aporovingly and the

Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would he rel

comed by the peoples of Europe, would facilitate agreement

on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and

"help improve relations and briny closer together" the tro

Gernan states.

The proposal was formalized in a 9 December 1957

government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki

to the US,

British, and French ambassadors in Warsaw.

then sovlet remier,

Bulganin, promptly endorsed the

in a sertes of letters to heads of governnents through-

out the world.

In 1958 Rapacki modifled his plan, allegedly to make

it more palatable to the Western powers.

of the plan, published in Novemher 1958, called for a two-

(1) current nuclear stockpiles

Czechoslovakia, East and kest Germany,

and (2) existius nuclear stockpiles

eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement

for the four-nation area.

The revised version

of the

plan also called for

"alr and kround control' with NATO

and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the control

system.

Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal

agreement on the Rapacki plan.

Shortly after the openin

of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the

Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation

of a nuclenr-free zone in Central Europe.

basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the

Rapack1 plan.

The Soviet delegation is currently urging

that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question

of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.

6. Since the Rapacki plan was introduced, it has had

support from Moscow.

The Soviets have

even urged

extending the zone to Include Baltic and Balkan countries.

Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a moans of

eliminating German power in Central Europe--one of Moscow's

major foreign policy objectives.

The US strongly opposes the Rapacks plan, viewing

It as a Bloc device to

neutralize Germany,

even perpetuate the division of German Implementation of the

de facto recognition of East Germany.

proposal would also be militarily disadvantageous

US military power in

Europe would be diminished with

out a concurrent decrease of Soviet strength.

weaken NATO.

8.

In Central Europe for the same reasons.

•tor the sang reason bon iso cons

Bonu also considers

such proposals as sinister and subtly

intimidatory to the

West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt with as if they

vere inert objects, and who detect in such schemes a creatior

of conditions for their eventual communization.

9. Public endorsement of the Rapacki plan by the Mexican

president would

mark the first such specific approval by a

outside the Soviet Bloc.

His endorsement

be widely propagandized b the Poles

and the Soviets

and could set a

procedent for them to socure such approval

the training began on 13 January

on 10 February 1969.

The training was conducted at a

training site, L

Mexico City, provided by LIENVOY-2 and LIELEGANT; the building in

which the training site apartment is located is owned by LIELEGANT,

and the latter and

LIENVOX-2 have their offices there.

HINMA-36-131

The LIENVOYS had originally requested that five (5) of

men be trained.

Howerer, upon arrival in Mexico City and

just prior to the scheduled beginning of the training they

requested that they be

permitted to add one man and that two men

in the class

from the Direccion Federal de Seguridad

In the latter case. they submitted three names but said

that only two of the three

would be expected to attend the class.

is it turned out all three of the latter group turned up,

bringing the class

to nine (9) students;

five (5) Army officers,

one civilian

group, and the three DFS men.

Following is a list of the trainees:

(1) Felix LOZANO Rangel.

DFS,

age 35.

(2)

Javier MASCERA Fuentes,

(3)

(4) Leonardo LOPEZ y LOPEZ, age

Army, age 31.

(S)

Jorge NARGAIN Ortiz, Captain, Mexican

age 29.

(9)

Roselio Rafael GARZA lernandez, Lieutenant,

Mexican Army, age 26.

The training objective of the program was to familiarize

the trainees with the basic tradecraft principles and techniques

involved in the conduct of clandestine activities, with primary

emphasis on the work and activities of security services.

Iargely tutorial in nature, numerous exercises were conducted in

Mexico City,

including two live problems which will beexplained

later in this dispatch, to further

familiarize the trainees with the

Considerable

on reporting and

clandestine communications, us well as on agent acquisition and

With the agreement of LITEMPO 12 who said verbally that

he had consulted with LITEUPOt) and LIENVOY-2, the three DES

trainees detained Hector SENTIES Rodriguez, who is known to have

had clandestine contact rich the sovicts,

the entire inter-

rogation but did not actually take part for security reasons.

SENTIES, nor did the latter see them.

In line with

the discussions and reading material, this live interrogation was s1

great value to them.

on 3 February 1969 LIENVOY-2 passed

along to MYLSCHRAINE a gocd lead concerning Carlos PEREZ Aguirre,

a young lexican who also has contact with the Soviets and Cubans.

this lead, but even this was of value to the trainees.

One traince

was required to make a pretext tolephone call, another team of two

made a noighborhood check, and the remainder were divided into teams

to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, the Social Security

Institute and tho Metropolitan Police.

Except for the last team,

all picked up some information of value, and the information and

its significance in terms of the projected investigation of PEREZ

discussed with them.

porformance of the class as a whole was remarkably

good.

5"nho three DFS men,-because of their previous trulning and

experience, were ablo to

absorb and understand the lectures and

reading material much

more quickly than the others.

None of the

others had any provious training or experience in intelligence or

security work..

However, they were keenly Interested, actively

participated in classroom discussions and field exercises, and all

prepared their written work in an acceptable manner.

The instructor

reviewed all written work with them, as woll as plans for meetings,

etc., and this proved most helpful.

Somewhat unusual for Latins,

all

students were

punctual; there were some very small and unimpor

tant dolays, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly

difficult traffic situation in Mexico City or to other reasons

their control.

No student was absent from classes

the ontire training period, and no student was late for

more than 45 minutes or an hour.

6.

In summary, the instructor and the Station feel that the

training objective

of the busic tradecraft principles and techniques to permit them to

begin operations.
