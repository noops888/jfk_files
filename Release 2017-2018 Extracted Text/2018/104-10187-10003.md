The Rapacki Plan :

1, The Polish proposal for a Central European
nuclear-free zone was introduced at the 2 October 1957
session of the UN General Assembly by the Polish Foreign
Minister, Adam Rapacki. Acting aS spokesman for the
Polish Government, he formulated the proposal: should
both East and West Germany agree to a ban on the produc-
tion and storage of nuclear weapons on their territories,
Poland would simultaneously introduce an identical ban on
her territory. Rapucki did not mention Czechoslovakia,
but the head of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking
after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his
couatry would join the agreement, extending the ban over
her territory, too. ‘The East Germans subsequently warnly
endorsed the proposal.

2. Rapacki'’s proposal had obviously been cleared ard
coordinated with Soviet leaders prior to its introduction.
Moscow promptly reported the proposal aperovingly and the
Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would te wel-
comed by the peoples of Europe, would facilitate agreement
on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and would
‘help improve relations and bring closer together" the two
German states.

3. The proposal was formalized in a 9 December 1957
Polish government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki
to the US, British, and French ambassadors in Warsaw. The
then Soviet Premier, Bulganin, promptly endorsed the pro-
posal in a series of letters to heads of governments through-
out, the world.

4, In 1958 Rapacki modified his plan, allexedly to make
it more palatable to the Western powers. The new version
of the plan, published in November 1953, called for a two-
stage program, in which: (1) current nuclear stockpiles and
bases would be frozen and production of nuclear weapons would
be banned in Poland, Czechoslovakia, East and West Germany,
and (2) existing nuclear stockpiles and weapons would &



eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement
for the four-nation area, The revised version of the

plan also called for "air and ground control’ with NATO
and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the control

systen,

5. Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal
agreement on the Rapacki plan. Shortly after the opening
of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the
Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation
of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe. The memoraxdum—
basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the
Rapacki plan. The Soviet delegation is currently urging
that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question
of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.

6. Since the Rapacki plan was introduced, it hag had
strong support from Moscow. The Soviets have even urged
extending the zone to include Baltie and Balkan countries.
Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a moans of
eliminating German power in Contral Furope--one of hioscow's
major foreign policy objectives.

7. The US strongly opposes the Rapacki plan, viewing
it as a Bloc device to neutralize Germany, to decpen and
even perpetuate the division of Germany, and to secure
de facto recognition of East Germany. Implementation of the
proposal would also be militarily disadvantageous to the
West. US military power in Furope would be diminished with-
out a concurrent decrease of Soviet strength. It would
weaken NATO,

8. The West German government 1s also vigorously op- «
posed to the Rapacki plan and all such "disengagement" plans
in Central Europe for the same reasons. Bona also considers
such proposals as sinister and subtly intimidatory to the
West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt-with as if they
were inert objects, and who detect in such schemes a creation
of conditions for their eventual communization.

9. Public endorsement of the Rapacki plan by the Mexican
president would mark the first such specific approval by a
government Jeader outside the Soviet Bloc. His endorsement

would be widely propagandized by the Poles and the Soviets
and could set a precedent for them to secure such approval ‘
by other nonbloc leaders,

ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information
~ REFERENCE : DIRECTOR-65355, 12 January 1969

1. As indicated in Reference and other communications, a
training request was made by the Station and approved by Headquarters,
to train a group under the LIENVOY Project to follow up on leads
produced by the joint LIENVOY operation and presumably other
Mexican Government unilateral sources, Lee R. MYLECHRAINE, WOMOLD
instructor who was assigned to the Mexico City Station until ‘

8 July 1968, was selected as the instructor, MYLECIRAINE arrived
in Mexico City on 9 January 1969; the training began on 13 January
and ended on 10 February 1969. The training was conducted at A

training site,
Mexico City, provided by LIENVOY-2 and LIELEGANT; the building in

which the training site apartment is located is owned by LIELEGANT,
and the latter and LIENYOY-2 have their offices there, The unit,
upon completion of the training, will use the apartment in which
the training was conducted for their offices.

2. The LIENVOYs had originally requested that five (5) of
their men be trained, However, upon arrival in Mexico City and
just prior to the scheduled beginning of the training they
requested that they be permitted to add one man and that two men
be included in the class from the Direccion Federal de Seguridad
(DFS). In the latter case. they submitted turee names but said
that only two of the three would be expected to attend the class.
As it turned out all thre of the latter group turned up, thus
bringing the class to nine (9) students, five (5) Army officers,
one civilian from the LIESVOY group, and the three DFS men,
Following is a list of the trainees!

(1) Felix LOZANO Rangel. DFS, age 35.
———-- (2) Javier MANCERA Fuentes, DFS, age 33.
- (3) Esteban GUZMAN Salgado, DFS, age 33.
(4) Leonardo LOPEZ y LOPEZ, age 23,
(5) Felipe TREJO Gonzalez, Lt. Col., Mexican
Army, age 46,
(6) Mariano CHANTRES Molina, Captain, Mexican
army, age 39.
(7) Ladislao SAL’

(8) Jorge MARGAIN Ortiz, Captain, ‘Mexican
Army, age 29,
_. (9) Rogelio Rafael GARZA Hernandez, Lieutenant,
Mexican Army, age 26,

3. The training objective of the program was to familiarize
the trainees with the basic tradecraft principles and techniques
involved in the conduct of clandestine activities, with primary
emphasis on the work and activities of security services. Although
largely tutorial in nature, numerous exercises were conducted in
Mexico City, including two live problems which will becaxplained
Yater in this dispatch, to further familiarize the trainees with the
techniques involved in surveillance, counter-surveillance, personal
meetings, déaddrops, interrogation, and investigation, The course
included discussion and reading material on opposition to clandestine
activities, organization and functions of a security service.
personal, physical and organization security; cover, concealment
and compartmentation, as well as the basic operational skills of
observation, description, casing, surveillance, and elicitation
and interviewing. Considerable time was spent on reporting and
clandestine communications, as well as on agent acquisition and

agent handling.

4, With the agreement of LITEMPO-12 {who said verbally that
he had consulted with LITENPO-4) and LIENVOY-2, the three DFS
trainees detained Hector SENTIES Rodriguez, who is known to have
had clandestine contact with the Sovicts, for interrogation, He
gas detained on the street near his home on the early morning of
4 February 1969 and interrogated throughout the day at a motel,
the Palo Alto, located at Ka 14 on the Mexico City-Toluct highway.
The other six (5) trainees were able to overhear the entire inter-
rogation but did not actually take part for security reasons, They
did not see SENTIES, nor did the latter see them. In line with
the discussions and reading material, this live interrogation was of
great value to them, Also. on 3 February 1969 LIENVOY-2 passed
along to MYLECHRAINE a goce lead concerning Carlos PEREZ Aguirre,
ho also has contact with the Soviets and Cubans,
ly one-half day could be spent on investigating

a young Mexican wi

this lead, but even this was of value to the trainees. One trainee
was required to make a pretext telephone call, another team of two
made a neighborhood check, and the remainder were divided into teams
to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, the Social Security
Institute and tho Metropolitan Police, Except for the last team,
all picked up some information of value, and the information and
its significance in terms of the projected investigation of PEREZ

was discussed with them,

5, The performance of the class as a whole was remarkably
good. Tho threc DFS men, -because of their previous training and
experience, were ablo to absorb and understand the lectures and
reading. material much more quickly than the others, None of the
others had any provious training or experience in intelligence or
security work.. However, they were keenly interested. actively
participated in classroom discussions and field exercises, and all
prepared their written work in an acceptable manner, The instructor
reviewed all written work with them, as woll as plans for meetings,
etc,, and this proved most helpful. Somewhat unusual for Latins,
all students wore punctual; there were some very small and unimpor=
tant delays, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly
difficult traffic situation in Mexico City or to other reasons
apparently beyond their control, No student was absent from classes
during the ontire training period, and no student was late for
more than 45 minutes or an hour,

6, In summary, the instructor and the Station fcol that the
training objective was accomplished, and that the trainees, although
hot yot experienced operators, have a sufficient enough understanding
of the basic tradecraft principles and techniques to permit thom to
begin operations. They are all intelligent and alert men, and
except for LOPEZ y LOPEZ all have an Army background, CHANTRES is
quite imaginative and resourceful, but. also quite cautious and
concerned about the possibility of flaps and compromises. He gets
along woll with all his fellow workers, and undoubtedly has real
leadership qualities, TREJO is somewhat talkative, opinionated and
argumentative, and may have trouble supervising others, but he,
too, demonstrated considerable imagination and resourcefulness.
GARZA, the youngest of tho Army group, appeared to be the most pro-
American, is very imaginative, and possesses considerable drive and
energy. On one occasion he had the instructor out to lunch at his
home, where he lives with his wife (they have no children). He
commented on numerous occasions about his many (almost annual)
shopping trips to San Antonio, where his wife has a number of close
relatives, GARZA, it 1s believed, would probably be the most
susceptible to development and possiple recruitment of the group,

7, Except for the remarks in paragraph 6 above, no individual
assessment will he forwarded herewith, The instructor has prepared
a memorandum on each man, including the DFS group, setting forth
his observations and opinions, as well as any information he was

able to obtain on the trainees.

8, MYLECHRAINE used the name "Sr, Tomas" with the trainees;
so far as is known they did not learn his true name, nor were they
aware where he was living in Mexico City. Likewise, they are not
aware that he has served previously in Mexico, There were no
incidents involving security during the training period, and no
other incidents or events that should be reported.
