1. Reference is made to a memorandum, captioned as above,
dated 30 September 1975. forwarding copies of certain documents
from the Office of Security files concerning GBH Weevirey.
These documents were requested by Mr. Jeffrey Kayden, Senate
Selact Committse Staff, who. commenced a review of the GiRMIEy)
files on 29 September 1975.

2. The Office of Security has concluded a separate review
of the ily: files and has highlighted certain contents thereof
to the DCI. The DCI has requested that materials concerning
the following items be provided to the Senate Select Committee
independent of any Senate Select Committee Staff requests, to
wit:

Lee Harvey Oswald

© The files contain a raw, unevaluated report
from (ghey) containing his reporting of an alle-
gation that Lee Harvey Oswald was in New York
City in the Winter of 1962, having contact with
a Cuban.

(Attached to instant memorandum, Tab A, is
a copy of (iiley’S) original report, and attendant
comments, suggesting receipt of the report circa
20. December 1963.)

Readily available public and Office of
Security information concerning Oswald makes
no reference to the possibility of his being
in New York City in the Winter of 1962. The
Warren Commission did not pursue such a line
of inquiry.

There is no evidence _in the
the file of the source ,@& ‘ eniovAbascal:
(@Mbsreiwuer)), #750643, that th nformation
was processed out of the Office of Security/
Security Research Staff, to which @aBéyi reported
the information. However, as@UAMISy! states in
the report: “I urged MBBseal to go to the F3I
with the information, and offered to arrange a
meeting. He promised to tell them the story,
and made contact through an agent (O'Brien)
whom he knew because of past activities."

Regarding (Afascal, his Office of Security
file contains the following concerning his
veracity: ~

Office of Security/Security Research
Staff memorandum dated 15 August 1966:
ogpascal has for several years furnished
information to SRS source which has been
proven to be utterly worthless and
usually fictitious."

Office of Security/Security Research
Staff memorandum dated 19 May 1965:
«(Mipsiscal) has furnished source with
intelligence information which appears
to be complete fabrication."

FBI letterhead memorandum dated

30 September 1963 captioned "Movimiento
Democrata Cristiano (MDC)" contains the
following statements about & ascal' by
FBI sources: "One would only have to
know EnniqueAbascal’to Imow that this
(a Life magazine articles) was nothing
but a publicity stunt on his part and
that he has no importance whatsoever in
the anti-Castro Movement." "Sometimes
in dealing with @Wascal, one does not
jmow whether or not he should pity him
or try to afford him some kind of medical

assistance." ‘"M@ascal) is merely a pub-

licity seeker.” RECEIVED FROM

It is apparent the office of Security/
Security Research Staff had _reason to
question the veracity of (iu: 3? precluding
further dissemination of the information;
and that there was.a reason to believe
that Miegeal would report the information
to the FBI for their action.

Arlington House, Publishers

The files contain a Taw, unevaluated
report from @ifiiley) containing his reporting
of an allegation that CIA had partial
control of, and once attempted full control
of, Arlington House, Publishers.

(Attached _to instant memorandum, Tab B,
is a copy of (ays) original report as well
as copies of attendant documents. The files
contain no further clarification of the
information.)

There is no Office of Security subject
file in the name of Arlington House or
Arlington House, Publishers.

From other sources, it would appear
that Arlington House, Publishers is con-
nected with the conservative causes of
William F. Buckley and the National Review.
Buckley is a former Agency employee an
his close connections with former Agency
employee EB. Howard Hunt have recently
received extensive publicity. It is
believed that numerous former Agency
employees are Linked with Buckley's causes, :
and this could be the foundation for the
rumored Agency involvement in Arlington

Information from

@ i Ro: LEZ HARVSY OSWALD. (RUNSEET) met Oswald last winter
in Greenwich Village, New York City at the "Fat Bleck

Pussy Cat" (which was much less expensive than it is

now, with fewer tourists). QABH8eaN saw him there several

times with extreme leftist, peacenik types. He seemed
to be 2 "loner", but did associate with a couple in
their early thirties, (See below.)

The last time that @MBHScaLr'saw Oswald he got into a
tion with him, end it almost ended in a fight.
lost his temper and wanted to hit Oswald be-
cause of his strong communist position. He was very
anti-U.S.A., pro-Castro and pro-Chinese Heds (but not
pro-Soviet Union).
What interested (Abascal: most was that Oswald hed no job
but still had sufficient money.

Tne couple Oswald associated with were quiet, but during
political discussions the man would feed Oswald key words
or bits of information when he was backed into a corner,

(Note. I urged (Ba ito_go to the FBI with the information, _
~smd-of Pereato-EPTUNES-@ Hestine. He promised to tell: ‘then (By

the story, and made contact through en agent (O'Brien) whom

@ Sources from inside Cuba have rkported that HERBERT MATTHEWS

. and two Russians met with Fidel Castro several months aga
and tried to convince him to step down in favor of a coalition
gov't, that Khrushchev and Kennedy had agreed on, Castro
refused to consider it, (Some Cubans think that Castro is
behind the Kennedy assassination - that he was acting to
block this deal which was to take effect before the 196k.
election.)

In early Dec. (see memo on my telephoned report for exact
date )@ADESCaT) revorted that CARLOS FRANKE of the Castro

publication "Revolution" was at Idlewild Airport. He had
arrived on flight 509 of BCAC from Paris & London, Franke

had just finished a trip behind the Iron Curtain.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

Ruan
#343 589

SUBJECT :

A memorandum dated 12 March 1970 seems to pinpoint
the time period during which MBE Wfirst made available to this
office a copy of Howard HUNT's manuscript, "Give Us This Day,"
as being early March 1970. The memorandum from!
to C/SRS advised that (MEY had telephoned from
home that afternoon and had asked if we had received the copy ”-
of/ Hunt Ms." (eee ee SWEET that it had come in'and
Syne} asked whether he should attempt to determine any more
details concerning the origin of it. suggested that
Q@uPBEN do nothing until we advised him. (Althoug’
referred to it as the "Hunt Ms.'' in his memorandum, it would
seem that (oem Y was not aware of the true authorship, at this
point). QWEBEY, expressed concern for his friend in the publish-
ing house, who had "filched'' the Ms., as he allegedly had
informed many! to be very careful with it. kdvised
that he informed @J#SSEY: that in all probability no decision would
be made on this for another three or four weeks.
