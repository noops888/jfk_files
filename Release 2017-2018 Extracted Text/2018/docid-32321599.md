Memorandum from John A. Hartingh to Mrs. Morris, dated 10/31/95

Re: JFK TASK FORCE

7.

HQ 62-109060-4NR 1244, NAR 124-10027-10059,

Identifles Merle Fainsod, Professor of Government and Director of

the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, as an

established source of the FBI.

Fainsod provided minimal

information regarding Priscilla Johnson, a well-known newspaper

woman and author who spent time in Russia.

Johnson was of

interest to the FBI in its efforts to interview individuals

possessing knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald.

RIF

8. HQ 62-109060-1581, NAR 124-10027-10044, identifies

two Cuban sources of the Chicago Office.

Ebelia Echevarria and

Jesus Martinez were described in this document as sources who

provided information concerning the Cuban community.

I+F

9.

HQ 62-109060-1NR 2321, NAR 124-10030-10093,

identifies Richard Hunter as an informant of the Cincinnati Police

Department who provided information regarding the illegal

sale and

possession of automatic weapons.

Hunter stated a fear of being

killed in retaliation by those people with which he associated,

and his identity was protected at his request.

The FBI provided written justifications arguing the

need to protect the individuals listed above.

However, the ARRB

supports the position that the information at issue is relevant

and significant to the assassination and that it outweighs any

harm that would be caused to the individuals to be disclosed.

As experienced in the prior appeal to the President, we

are experiencing difficulty meeting the statutory burden of

protecting FBI symbol number informants, PSI's and PCI's.

would be far more difficult, if not impossible to meet that burden

that these nine individuals currently require protection, under

the JFK statute as interpreted by this board. We would have t√≤

determine whether

they are alive, locate them and/or their

relatives, interview them for their position on disclosure and

identify specific harms that would result from their disclosure.

to provide their opinion and

reasons to

by 11/6/95, as the FBI only has 7 days to appeal upon receipt of

the letter.
