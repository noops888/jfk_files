ADMINTSTRAIIVE

On April 5, 1961, SA HAROLD L. WILLIAMS, Pittsburgh Sound-Trained

Agent, and SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH,

III surveilled the cottage of

GABRIEL MANNARINO located on Old Leechburg Road, R. D. No: 3,

Leechburg; Pa,, with a view toward ascertaining the feasibility

of a technical Installation.

All construction appeared to be

complete and nobody was observed in the neighborhood.

Because of

the rural location, terrain, limited service facilities and

proximity of neighbors friendly toward MANNARIN®, It was apparent

that such an installation would have numerous technieal, mechanical

and security problems and would be very difficult.

Special Agents

handling these matters will continue to be alert for possibilities

for technical coverage for this and other logical locations.

The spot fisur on GABRIEL MANNARINO's Surfside, Florida, house

on March 14, 1961, was conducted by SA C. GRAHAM HURST.

The spot fisurs at MANNARINO's Surfside, Florida,

house on

April 7, 1961, and April 19, 1961, were conducted by SA ROBERT K.

LEWIS.

The spot fisurs at GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage near Leechburg, Pa.•

on March 23, 1961, and April 19, 1961, were conducted by SA FORSYTH.

The pretext interview on May 2, 1961, with LEE KUINS, caretaker

at MANNARINO's cottage, was conducted by SAs PAUL D. 0 BRIEN and

ROBERT EMMET GRANT, who pretended to be advertising company

photographers. The same SAs observed GABRIEL, MANNARINO at the

Bonfire Restaurant, Leechburg, on May 2, 1961.
