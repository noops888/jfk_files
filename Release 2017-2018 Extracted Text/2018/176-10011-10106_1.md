SPECIAL HANDLING

CONSIDERATIONS

"Minor acts of sabotäge" include such

actions as excessive use of electricity or

short-circuiting of telephone equipment,

immobilizing vehicles (stealing parts,

puncturing tires. contaminating gas tanke),

material spollage.

and crop burning.

All forms of media, non-US government

attributable,

will be used to get the message:

to the Cuban people; however, unless a

method of mass distribution of leaflets. is

used, it is probable that this activity will

be minor and spotty.

Depending upon circumstances, the sabotage;

will be conducted either by especially.

trained, carefully selected commando /

sabotage teams infiltrated especially for the

operation and exfiltrated at the completion

of the operation, or by internal assets if such

SPECIAL HANDLING:

PURPOSE

To dripale Cuban commerce and

place strain upon regime security

forces.

To force the use of more Bloc

resources. including shipping.

To force the use of more Bloc

resources, to deny Cuba hard

currency earnings, and to hasten

deterioration of Cuba's essentially

free world equipped industrial

plant.

To provide a basis for renewed

pressures upon NATO to recom-

mend trade controls to NATO

members.

TOP SECRET-NOFORN

SPECIAL HANDLING

CONSIDERATIONS

Things, not people, are the targets. This

activity requires a capability to act quickly

on spot intelligence. Targets are seen mostly

as shipmente of products into or from Cuba:

Sabotage would be to cause undue delay of

shipment, using additives to spoil a commo-

dity, fire or water damage, etc. A recent

example was reported, post-action, on a

shipment to the USSR:

This is an activity mostly in third countries

Most free world trading nations are opposed

to imposing.necessary-trade. controls. Im-

porters might be dissuaded from using Cuba

as a source of supply, such as the example

of Japan recently. Preclusive buying ard

other forms of economic warfare deserve

hard consideration:

OAS Special Committee action should be

geared to SCCS reports or other develop-

ments in the Hemisphere which might provide

a good basis for Special Committee action.
