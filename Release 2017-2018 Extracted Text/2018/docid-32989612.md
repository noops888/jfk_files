3, Statements of former and current FBI officials,

On November 15, 1974, hi. C. D. Deloach, former
Assistant to the Director, FBI, was telephonically contacted by an FBI
official and asked if he had any recollection concerning the briefing of
any Departmental official with regard to our Cointelpros, iir. DeLoach
responded he had talked to former Attorney General Clark on several
occasions and discussed with him all phases of the operations of the
Intelligence Division of the FBI in which these programs were handled,
Mr, DeLoach stated he had briefed former Attorney General Clark not
only regarding the various Cointelpros but regarding even more sensi-
tive matters. Nir. Deloach could not place any date of such briefings
but he recalled very specifically having so briefed the Attorney General,

Additionally, iir. DeLoach stated it was his recollection
that former Attorney General Nicholas deB, Katzenbach knew about the
Cointelpro relating to the Ku Klux Klan but that he, ir. DeLoach, had
not personally briefed him regarding this matter. ir. DeLoach said
former Attorney General Katzenbach was possibly briefed by former
Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont or former Assistant to the
Director WilHar C, Sullivan, Wir. DeLoach added he recalied very
clearly briefing former President Johnson regarding the Bureau's
activities against black silitants in the United ftates, iir, DeLoach
stated he was sure of the foregoing and would be glad to so testify.

On November 16, 1974, former Assistant to the Direc~
tor John P. ivohr stated he vividly recalled on several occasions the
Director had furnished in detail information to the Subcommittee of

regarding the Cointclpros, i.ir. Mohr gtated he recalled the Committee
menbers were most irapresced with the material and were commenda-
tory in their coments that the FBI was taking actions with regard to
the organizations ond groups discusced and that none of the Commitice
yaembors made any critical comments relating to these operations.

iar. Mohr indicated he would be glad to tcstify to the above,

On November 18, 1974, Associate Dircctor Nicholas P.
Callahan, FBI, indicatcd he, too, recalled there were several instances,
cuact dates not recalled, in which he accompanicd former Director
Hoover when the latter testified before the Cubcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee. Although (ir, Callahan was uot able to
recall specific dates, he did recall off-the-record discussions with
members of the Comittee ond the questioning of the Director vith
regard to the Sureau's efforts to neutralize groups and organizations,
Mix. Callahan stated there was no critical comment made in regard
thereto,

4, Hearings before the House Subcominittee on
Appropriations,

FBI records show that detailed information concerning
the FBI Cointelpros was prepared for off-the-record use by former
Director Hoover in connection with six appcarances before the House
Cabcoramitice on Appropriations between 1958 and 1966. BPubliched
reports of the hearings contained notations that off-tho-record din~

Senstudy 75 Project). Miss Korb, antemployee of WFO, reported a
to the Legal Counsel Division 3/24/75 for temporary assignment in ’

' the Freedom of Information Act Unit. This temporary assignment

4 was changed to INTD 4/22/75 and for continuance in her duties in

INTD with the Senstudy 75 Project, a position description to facilitate

her permanent transfer to the Project would normally be required

after 120 days from 3/24/75, or by 7/21/75.

Miss Korb is currently on extended annual leave (from
r 6/13 - 7/11 -- total of 20 work days). In view of this extended period

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

NOTE:

Original monograph outlining subversive connections
of King and other pertinent data was originally prepared and
disseminated at a high level in the Government 10/16/63, These
copies were subsequently retrieved because the Attorney General
felt they should be recalled, Subsequent revisions and updating
of the monograph were prepared and disseminated in 1964, 1967
and 1968,

Copies of Director Hoover's internal memoranda dated
11/7/63 and 2/5/64 being furnished the Attorney General and the
SSC have had data originally contained therein excised which is
not germane to the SSC's request, This information deals generally
_with the Bobby Baker and Ellen Rometsch cases; a bombing in
Birmingham, Alabama; off-the+record discussions relative to King's
communist affiliations with the Rooney Committee; a letter on
King prepared for the Attorney General; leaks by the press of data
on FBI cases; and personal comments,

Memorandum 12/17/64, from F, J. Baumgardner to W, C,
Sullivan, captioned "Communist Infiltration of SCLC, IS«C" has
been excised to conceal source of information for data concerning
and identity of Cordy T, Vivian, Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) Director of Affiliates, a past member of the
Communist Party, USA, This memorandum also excised to delete name
of Senator Richard Russell (D-Georgia) who it was recommended be
advised concerning SCLC's utilization as a recruiter of blacks
to take part in the National Science Foundation program and the
identity of the University of Mississippi as one of the schools
for which recruits were to be sought,

Memorandum C, D. Brennan to W, C, Sullivan dated 8/24/67
eaptioned "Martin Luther King, Jr., SM+C" showing dissemination of
monograph to a\representative of a friendly foreign intelligence
service has been excised to delete the identity of its recipient,
fa_covert Australian intelligence officer assigned at the
Australian Embassy, Washington, D. C., as well as the identity of
his Service and country | )

RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

NOTE CONTINUED:

Memorandum 3/11/68 captioned "Martin Luther King, Jr.,
SM-C" prepared by G. C. Moore for W. C. Sullivan was excised to
delete names of prominent black extremists Stokely Carmichael
and H, Rap Brown_due to privacy considerations.

It is also noted that review of appropriate files in
connection with this project failed to result in location of
memoranda dated 12/21/64 which secured authority to furnish
copies of the King monograph to Carl T, Rowan, then Director of the
United States Information Agency, and to then Vice President
Hubert H, Humphrey, Letters of transmittal to these individuals
are among enclosures attached,

Privacy considerations also involved in some of the
excisions in the 8/24/67 and 12/17/64 communications mentioned
above, Wo third agency consideration involved in documents
being furnished SSC. Also, excisions made in memoranda 11/22/64
and 11/27/64 from Sullivan to Belmont, because of privacy
considerations.

«

The Attorney General stated he {s concerned about that as he
understocd Iwas. He stated a lot af these things scem to be coming out ia
the payers which were not before. Iagreed and stated Drew Pcarson, I happen
to knew, in regard to his column this morning, got the entire information
‘orce who have costes of our reports; that this man (Reynolds)
was inthe Air Forve and we made an investiration of him then because of the
security risk; that Pearson got access to the files of the Air Force and has
attributed it to us - thet whon you read the thing, it sounds as’ though everything
was furnished by the FRI when in reality Pearson could not get inside any coor af
the Barcau as he is held in contempt by everybody in the Eurcau. I stated
fearsen hangs it on to the FEL as if it emanated from us. Latated Pearsen
nm of the President, that he

they travel tovcther and spend vacations together. I stated I had been tipped

off in advance that Pearsoa was writing a colinin critical of the Sareau and
giving information regarding tha Lee Harvey Cawald Case and Foarson rade -
it appear we were leaking Information when as a matter of fact nothing ever _

‘Was loaked out until after the report lolt the Bureau and then things began

leaking cut, I stated a lot leaked out in Dallas from the Folice Department,
which was doing a lot of talking about the evicicnce they sont us like the

gun, the fingerprints, et cetera. I stated we identified them and in turn made
a@ report to the Dallas Police Depast-cent and the Chief thea went on TV aad
radio and reported what we found, i stated I told the Agent in Charge to tell
the Caief I wanted him to shut ap; of course, the Chief could have ignored me,
but nevertacless I thought he was doing a grent deal of harm, but the Chief

@id shut up and he never appeared on TV or radio azain, but the harm had
been cone hecause certain members of the Presidential Commission on the
Assassination thought the material was leaked out by the FBI. i stated
Pearson was the author of that kind of a coluran just as this morning if you
read his column, the F SI iurnished everything about this fellow Reynolds who
is involved in the Ecobby Eaker cage when, infact, copies of oar resorts af -
an investication oa iieynolds years ago went tothe Air Force, I stated 1 was
ths Air Yorce and he was golnz to write a cphsein, not only one but [thins icar
coluxns, which will be favorable to WaltexiJenking and the Psesicent and dis-__
crediting Keynolis particularly. : { ee

This memorandum recommends that the National Science

This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by the
NSF for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools,

Memorandum to W. C, Sullivan

From F, J. Baumgardner : i

RE; COMNUNIST INFILTRATION OF '
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ;

100-438794 :

U. S. Government are involved, The Atlanta Office has ~
recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D, Georgia) be
advised concerning this matter, This appears inadvisable
since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the
South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,
NSF, should be furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCLC and King, In this regard °.
we recently disseminated to the White House and the :
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret!
summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Movement--A :
Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the
SCLC and King. This summary deals with King's communist
connections and his personal immoral activities, With the
receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCLC would
undoubtedly be removed from the NST proygeam to chtain qualificd
Negro students for southern schools,

The information concerning the SCIC participation -
in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the
Department and interested intelligence agencies.

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to
Dr, Ieland J, Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy
of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and
the Negro Movement--A Current Analysis."

You will recall that in Doceaeees 1964, with the

given in the paper to the communist influences on Martin Luther

of a "mediator" in problems relating to the racial field. Ee

disseminated to that agency. We just received reliable infor-
mation concerning a conversation between Martin Luther King, Jr.,
and his wife, Coretta, during which Coretta made reference to
the Selma situation and said that Collins was blinded by
prejudice, We have disseminated the information concerning

the King conversation to CRS.

It is believed that, in view of Collins' ee

BACKGROUND:

| Johnson was unaware of the communist influence being exerted
on Martin Luther King, Jr., and his group the Southern

In November of 1964, interested officials of the
Government, including the Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary of
Fenn’ were furnished copies of the _monograph entitled, |

Oo

‘Communism and the _Negro Movement - A Current “Analysis.”

It is felt that Ambassador Johnson, because of his
position, should be made aware of communist infiltration into
King's group, and the influence being exerted on King.

David Levisen; (2) facts relating to King’s moral degeneracy;
and (3) communist goal of uniting the peace and civil rights
movements and King's s adherence to this communist long-range
objective.

King*s strong criticism and condemnation of the
Administration's policy on Vietnam in a speech he made at New York
on 4/4/67 shows how much he has been influenced by communist’
advisors. His speech was a direct parallel of the communist
position on Vietnam,

Mr. Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed

that the monograph on Martin Luther King, Jr., be brought
up to date,

oe

_ This is an excellent suggestion and we have alreddy :
started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to .
date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's '"Wash-
ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level
gle in Government of the wholly disreputable character

‘of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was
originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our
Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

_ group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals
‘to participatein the demonstration and the date for the project
has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a . thorough job.on
this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring toget!
the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it j
in a hard-hitting manner, To make the brief timely, we will
have it. completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

“The Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) presents a greater 3
menace to the internal security of our Nation today than it > - .
ever has since it was first foynded in this country in 1919.
The dangerousness of the CPUSA cannot be evaluated except in
the light of its relationship to the international communist
conspiracy and its ties to the Soviet Union. in this regard -
it is well to note that the rate of progress achieved by the - |
international comunist offensive is unparalleled in history.

In the past 43 years, it has advanced steadily and surely,

never varying its eventual goal of dominating the world,

until feday its empire extends from Rast Germany to China.’

This empire is so vast and sprawling that when night settles

on its western frontier, dawn already ig breaking on its

eastern frontier. This internation:i communist conspiracy
controls one -fourth of the land area and ccalcamaclan! one

third of the inhabitants of the earth,

: Our responsibilities in the internal security field
are twofold: (1) to colicct intelligence information and
disseminate it to appropriate Government agencies and (2) to
obtain leqally admissible evidence for aabcahaatabatc under 2,
existing Federal statutes. . 7 7

By Presidential birective dated September 6, 1939,
the FBI was designated as the civilian intelligence agency
primarily responsible for protecting the Nation? ® internal
security. Since that date, it nas been the FBI's duty te
investigate subversion within the United States and to wants
correlate all infornatien relating to America's internal pee
security and disseninate these data to interested Federal. +

primarily at the CPUSA are the Smith Act of 1940, the Internal |
Security Act of 1950 and the Conmunist Control “Act of aan

FBI COONTERATTACK on

The FBI's counterattack against the cPusA. is many ~
: pronged, Some of our more effective progrags are: penetration

various techniques to keep the Party off balance and disillusion
individual communists concerning communist ideology; investigation
of avery | nber. of the CPUSA in arder ta datar ming whother.
he. should ned in the event.of a national eme: ency; and
gathering evidence to be used in prosecutions of communists and
comiunist organizations,

Through our security informant program, we have infil-
trated the CPUSA to such an extent that we are sometimes ina
position to know what Abe jfarty i is going to do he.

i clandestine apparatus, the Soviets have funneled into the cPUSA
over one-half million doidarg in cash ‘during the past two years.
Much of this money has been passed to CPUSA representatives in

: We are keeping abreast of the activity of the CPUSA,
which is attempting through its programs to infiltrate American
institutions and groups and to increase its influence on the
American scene, by intensive investigation into every facet of
its activity. Over the years we have investigated thousands of
individual members of the CPUSA in order to determine whether”
they might constitute a potential danger to the internal security
of the country in time of a national cmergency. The results of
these investigations are furnished various departments and
agencics of the Executive Branch of the Government when infor-
mation is developed during the course of the investigations of
interest to then, The dissemination of this information enables
these departments and agencies of tae Government to take what-
ever action is necessary from a policy standpoint as it relates’
to the security of their operations.

. , Prosecution has been a major weapon against the CPUSA.
The Department of Justice first instituted prosecution against -
leaders of the CPUSA in New York City in 1948, Since that tine
prosecution has been instituted against numerous individual cos-
tunist functionaries, against the CPUSA as an organization,
against comaunist front craanizations and against labor unions
controlled and dominated by communist elements, The primary
evidence in all of these prosecutions was furnished by our
security informants, He have made available approximately 100
security informants for testimony in these cases,

The Supreme Court of the United States ig presently

considering communist cases under the Internal Security Act of

‘ 1950 and the Smith Act of 1940. As was expected, CPUSA funce

tionaries have irdicated the Party will go underground if a
decision is rendered against them by the Supreme Court. Should
this occur, we will, of course, through our informants, attenpt
to go underground with them and thus keep advised of their
activitics and whereabouts. - :

KU RLUX KLAN INVESTIGATIONS
FBI ACCOMPLISHMENTS

‘

,BACKGROUND

- “istorics117, the problem of the Ku Klux Klan in
the United States has exiSted since the days of Reconstruction
following the Civil War. The Invisible Empire is well known
for its terrorist, nightriding activities and has been respon-
sible since its inception for mumerous racial atrocities
throughout the country. The Klan reached its peak during the
1920s when it claimed millions of members and-it became almost
defunct during World War IT., In 1954, with the historic
Supreme Court decision regarding desegregation of public
schools, it became revitalized. In 1964 >, With the passage of
civil rights Legislatiow by the Congress, the Kia recruited
- thousands of persons who feared the-rise of the Negro and __

: the threat to the areas way of life." ne

ee

.

The Klan ee usually been located in the South al-
though there have been attempts to organize it in the North;--
Midwest, and far West. The Klan attracts individuals in the
rural areas whe are poorly educated with:limited incomes.

The Klan exploits the fears, hatred, and ignorance of people
who feel they are threatened by the Negro, the Jew, the ~
sceeaiatere and the inmigrant.

PRESENT STATUS ae
ane Presently there are 14 Klan organizations under’ -
——__tavestigation with a membership of approximately 14,000. The
“= _» Ylargest of these groups, the United Klans of America, - Inc.,
= 7 Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, with Headquarters in Tuscaloosa,

: Since 1964 Klan membership has declined, in
Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana and increased in North
and South Carolina and Virginia, Thé North Carolina Klan
has the largest membership of any state in the Union under
the leadership of (Grand Dr Dragon nN R. ~wones} iad 7 “
The most secretive and-vicious Klan a aoaetaae

in recent years has been “the White Knights of the Ku
Klan of Kien of Mississippi under the leadership of Same

Bo ERT A TES of Laurel, Mississippi, who was rec poorest con-
victed in connection with the murder of [three ci civil rights
f es ounty, if ssissippt, in June, 1964..

FBE RESPONSIBILITY

This ‘Bureau has a~ three- fold purpoge in investigating
the Ku Klux Klan and individuals associated with Klan organi- :
zations, First, we investigate violations of Federal law
committed by the Klan wi “th the view toward prosecution in
Federal court. Second, we conduct intelligence investigations
with the view toward infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan with infor-
mants, neutralizing it as a terrorist organization, and deterring
violence. Third, -we provide the Department with the results
of our investigations for possible designation of Klan organi-
zations under Executive Order 10450.

MAJOR _CASES

Murder of Three Civil Rights Workers _

In June, 1964, three civil rights workers were
murdered in Neshoba County, Mississippi, setting off an inten-
sive FBI investigation, In October, 1967, 7 of 18 defendants:
were ‘convicted in Federal court in Meridian, Mississippi, for

violation of the victims' civil rights, An 8th defendant
pleaded guilty and a mistrial was déclared as to three other
defendants,. Our investigations revealed that there was a broad
Ki Klux Klan plot kehind the abduction and murder of the victims.

the National Association.for the Advancement of Colored,

r wounds received when his home was burned and shot into by

the Ku Klux Klan, Twelve klansmen have been indicted by

Murder-‘of Lemuel Penn .” Bee Steed

In July, 1964, Lemuel Penn, an Army Reserve ne
Lieutenant Colonel and Negro educator from Washington, D. C.,
was killed by shotgun blasts near Colbert, Georgia. An exhaus-
tive investigation by this Bureau resulted in the arrest of
four members of the Ku Klux Klan, Informants also played a
major role in this case. In October, 1964, a Federal Grand
Jury returned an indictment charging six men, including the
four arrested for Penn's murder, with conspiracy to injure,
oppress, and threaten to intimidate Negro citizens in the free
exercise of their Constitutional rights, Two of the defendants
were convicted and four were acquitted. _ :

From June through September, 1964, a series of

FBI investigation; nine members of the Ku Klux Klan were
arrested and charged with bombing homes and churches at McComb,
These nine klansmen entered pleas of. guilty and nolo contendere

In early 1965, a strategically placed informant

authorities, Three defendants were convicted in State court.

Bogalusa Injunction
In Bogalusa, Louisiana, during the height of the

led.to the obtaining of an injunction against the Anti~

Klan violence in that community.

no prosecutable Federal violation. However, we pursued an

ities in’Milwaukee with complete information coming from
our Chicago Klan informants. Cwrher Warden Gheney? was sub-
sequently convicted and sentenced to 15 years. The result

tn the Fall of 1965 the United Kans of America began
an intensive organizational effort in the State of Virginia,
We immediately began an all-out effort to penetrate the
Virginia Klan, contain its growth, and deter violence. Working
closely with local and state authorities we were able to
disseminate information on contemplated cross burnings.
Several arrests were made based on FBI information furnished
to local police and in one situation, a klansman was sentenced
to three years in local court for burning crosses, a felony
under Virginia law. While conducting official investigations,
two Agents of this Bureau were assaulted by klansmen vho were .
later convicted on charges of Assault of a Federal Officer and

: Obstruction of Justice in Federal Court in Richmond, Virginia.

and the FBI in Klan matters, ‘We provided'the Governor with .
information regarding Klan activities in his state. As a
result, Governor Godwin pressed for more effective enforcenent -
of Virginia cross burning laws, .and publically repudiated the |
Ku Klux Klan. Shortly after thé Governor's public repudiation,
the Klan attempted..to retaliate and we learned of plans to
burn erosses in the Gity of Richmond in defiance of the
Governor, We furnished this data to local authorities who _
arrested five klansmen, thus endaieted dampening Klan enthu-
siasm for such projects.

a In May, 1966, we learned of Klen ee to “arrange
an aceldent" for(Nan Crogan} a civil rights ¥ worker working in
the State of Virginia.” te advised "MISS Crogam and local
authorities of the plot against her life ‘and’ elerted our in-
formants to follow the plot closely. To this.date, the Klan

“LEATSON WITH LOCAL, AUTHORITY TES ft
When we receive intelligence information concerning
violations of local laws such as cross burnings, bombings,
or shootings, we notify local authorities, For example, in
April of 1966, the Louisiana Klan planned to burn crosses
throughout the state. We furnished this data to local author- .
ities and arrests were effected thus deterring further ects
of. harassment, intimidation, and violence, This 1s another
example of ineidents which are handled in our day-to-day cons
tects with local police. .

Ku Klux len Invegtigations
it LAN INFILTRATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

» We are constantly alert for information concerning
klansmen who become members of local: and state police
agencies and Klan attempts to infiltrate law enforcement.
Law enforcement agencies have always been a prime target of
the Ku Klux Klan, In 1964, we furnished information to -
Governor Paul Johnson of Mississippi concerning klensmen who
were members of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. These men
were subsequently fired. Since that time relations hava
greatly improved rendering more effective the fair exercise
of local law enforcement responsibilities in Mississippi.

It has been part of our established policy to notify

the head of the law enforcement agency involved of any mem-’
ber of his organization who has*been sworn into the Ku Klux
Rlan. In addition, the Governor of the state is notified.

ACQUISITION OF WEAPONS AND pywashri oF. THE _KU_KLUX_KLAN

o ates 3

As part of cur’ favestt, gation of Klon ge groups, We
determine the éxtent to which they are acquiring and stocke
piling weapons, ammunition, and dynamite, During our inves- .
tigations we always endeavor to determine the numbers and
types of weapons. and the amount o£ dynamite
_klansmen. In 1964, for example, R

(Mississipp!; was arrested by FBI Agents and Local authorities
for possession of dynamite which, according to our Klan’
sources, he intended to use for bombing purposes,

arr

“-T€ it is determined that tllegal weapons such as
automatic machine guns;. illegal rifles and shotguns, are’
being held by klansmen, appropriate investigations under the
National and/or Federal Firearms Act are instituted,

“ perervieus OF KLANSMEN

One of the greatest attractions for klansmen 1s
the alleged cloak of secrecy which surrounds their Klan - ;
membership. We have found that.e program of selective inter-
views of klansmen, where they are made aware of our knowledge
of their Klan affiliation, has done much to cause disillusion-
ment of thé members and disruption of the organization.” In |
some instances klansmen volunteer information about the
organization and its activities, These interviews also put
us in a position to assess eachmmember with regard to his
potential as an informant, Although our Agents in conducting
their interviews are frequently - met with hostility and threats
by militant klansmen, our Klen interview program has been most

+ 7 effective in deterring violence and developips informants.

RECENT. DEVELOPMENTS: 2
On December 7, 1967, an informant of our Mobile
Division learned of Yan plans to burn crosses in Montgomery,
Alabama, This information was disseminated to appropriate
local authorities inf an effort to effect arrests during the
commission of. thésé illegal acts, -

Only within the last-week an informant of our

of 105 sticks of dynamite byl See He Haxper_of Jackson, oF Jackso larper_of Jackson,

Se eet i 4 , a - OFF THE RECORD

TA highly specialized ne aggressive program of counter-
Antelligénce was initiated in 1956 for the purpose of exposing,
disrupting, discrediting, and otherwise neutralizing the Communis
Party-USA, and related organizations. Accumulated successes
‘achieved in _ efforts directed against the comimists under
this program, coupled with increased activity by the purveyors
of racial hate, warranted the expansion of the program in the -

, Fall of 1964 to ‘Include Klan- and hate-type organizations and
their memberships. Counterintelligence. action today is a valu-.
-able adjunct to Investigative responsibilities and the techniques
sed complement our investigations. AL information related: to
“the targeted organizations , their. leadership and members, which
is developed from a variety of sources, is carefully reviewed
for its potential for’use under this program. aeenend :

Examples of recent disrupting and neutralizing results
achieved by this program are the following: : it :

“The principal vehicle in which the Communist
is endeavoring to influence and recruit youth is the W. E. B.
DuBois Clubs of America, which was spawmed by the Party in
-San Francisco, California, in June, 1964. The DuBois Clubs
projects itself as a "broad—based Socialist organization, a" while
its dedicated communist leadership deviously operates behind the
Scenes in an effort to manipulate and influence the political

‘climate on the Nation's campuses. |

SUBJECT: COMMUNISM AND THE DATE
NEGRO MOVEMENT .~ : 7

The Attor mney General telephoned at’ approximately 10:15 a. m.
He auivised that he had ‘tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of
the building. The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Army
had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about the
communist activities of Martin Luther King. The Attorney Genera: was reice
to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Current,”
Analyses, * dated Cctober 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report”
\to which heis referring, alt though he persisted on calling it the report onthe
|communist background of Martin Luther K King. :

The Aitorney General said he would like to know what other
dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose
for‘such dissemination. He was obviously irritated, He went on to ask if the
‘Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney General that
Obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,
but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not
concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's personal
attention. I pointed out to him that We regularly submitted some type of reports
\in matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction, and that
dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well
jas other top governmental officials Leeann of oie jceceaeentia they have i in this
{eonnection, :

H
The Attorney General asked what ‘responsibilities the Army had in
{relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney
'Geneval the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communist
lactivities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be
fealled’on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability”

‘of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.” The Attorney General
said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's
communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the dissemina
tion of the report in question and the purpose for it,

RE: COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF

U. S. Government are involved, The Atlanta Office has | ~
recommended that ~ be
advised concerning this matter, This appears inadvisable
since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which
would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the
South,

It is felt that Dr. Leland J, Haworth, Director,
NSF, should be furnished information regarding communist
influences exerted on the SCLC and King. In this regard
we recently disseminated to the White House and the Ont
heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"
summary entitled "Communism and the Negro Hovement--A .
Current Analysis" which contains information regarding the
SCLC and King. This summary deals with King’s communist
connections and his personal immoral activities, With the
receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth the SCLC would
undoubtedly he removed fram the WS? program to obtain qualified
Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCLC participation ~
in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the
Department and interested intelligence agencies, .-

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to
Dr, Leland J, Haworth, Director, NSF, transmitting a copy
of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and

You will recall that in December, 1964, with the
Director's approval and after first checking with the White |
“House, we disseminated to the Heads of the intelligence
community a paper’ captioned as above which depicted the
communist influence in the Negro movement. ‘ Emphasis was
given in the paper to the communist influences on Martin Luther
King,Jr., as well as facts relating to his immoral nature,

Gd As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of
Florida, is Director, Community Relations Service (CRS),
Departiient of Commerce, aud in this position serves as something
of a "mediator"! in problems relating to the racial field. He
has been a key individual relative to the situation in Selma,
Alabama, Information of interest to the CRS is regularly being
disseminated to that agency, We just received reliable infor=
mation concerning a conversation between Martin Luther King, Jr.
and his wife, Coretta, during which Coretta made reference to
the Selma situation and said that Colljns was blinded by

the King conversation a CRS. ‘

s believed thet, in view o Collins' importan
position relative to the racial movement, he should have
benefit of the paper which we have already given to the
White House and the Heads of the intelligence community. Our rela-
tions with Collins have been restarted he is a long-time admirer of

document is a current revision of the previous analysis

captioned "Communism and the Negro movement ~ A Current Aualysis,”

‘prepared and disseminated in November, 1964. In updating it,
we have emphasized these areas: (1) continued reliance of King
upon former Communist Party, USA, members, particularly Stanley
‘David Levison; (2) facts relating to King’s moral degeneracy3,
-and (3) communist goal of uniting the peace and civil rights
movements and King's adherence to this communist dong-range
objective. 5

of King.

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project"! was

Washington Field Office has developed information that King's
‘group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals
to participatein the demonstration and the date for he proj

I discussed with Mr. Adams at 5:05 p.m., 6/20/75, the necessity to
advise Mr. Wilderotter that the inventory was prepared and to discuss - >
with him the propriety of making this material available to the Department. 1
‘Mr. Adams agreed and I called Mr. Wilderotter's Office at the White
‘House at 5:10 p.m., 6/20. His secretary assured me he would return a
my cali. Mr. Wilderotter called me at 10:15 a.m., on 6/23, I explained ™S
to him that Mr. Farrington had completed compiling an inventory of the SX
items Wilderotter furnished Farrington and that among the items on the
inventory I observed several which related to the official and vce sue.

files that,had been maintained in Director Hoover's personal office suite. ;
I told Mr. Wilderotter that it was my understanding that the Deputy
Attorney General was interested in discussing the official and confidential
files with the Attor: General prior to discussing the matter with :
representatives of  Senate-Select.Cammittee. I told him that I thought § g
it would be necessary for ‘ine to advise the Deputy Attorney General that

Memo to Mr. Adams a
Re: Inventory of Documents Received From
Former Associate Deputy Attorney General

in any way I felt was appropriate. He said that he would like to have
(an indication from the Bureau as to the materials we had received
from him and some sort of a receipt for the materials. He saidhe _
did not want to be accused later of having removed classified material
rom the Department of Justice. In that regard I told Wilderotter that
e probably could furnish him a copy of the inventory and a receipt
_ indicating that the items described therein were receivedfrom him, _

I undersiand Mr. Wilderotter's concern about possible
allegations that he removed material from the Department and I believe
it would be appropriate for us to prepare some statement indicating the
extent of the materials he did furnish to Mr. Farrington. If we furnish
Wilderotter a copy of the inventory, he will have information classified
top secret and sufficient identifying data as to particular documents to
indicate the identities of individuals which could, if inadvertently
disclosed, result in invasions of personal privacy. Therefore, I suggest
that we may comply with Mr. Wilderotter's request by attaching a copy
of the inventory to a letter addressed to the Attorney General stating that
the materials described were received from Mr. Wilderotter. We could
furnish Mr. Wilderotter a copy of that-letter and allow him to review. =)

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Pine

"Piety
June 4, 1975 yg

I was questioned by Mr. Mark Gittenstein and Miss Mary D'Oreo,
members of this Committee, on June 4, 1975, from 2:30 P.M. to
4:40 P. M. on June 4, 1975.

He started the questioning by asking about the different positions held
by Mr. Tolson in the FBI. He was advised when he came to the Seat of
Government he held the positions of Chief Clerk in the Administrative Division,
Inspector, Assistant Director, Assistant to the Director and Associate
Director. He asked how many people were in Mr. Tolson's Office at the
time of Mr. Hoover's death. I advised him that Mr. Mark Felt, Mr. William B.
Soyars, Mrs. Mutter, Miss Smith and Miss Tschudy (in the reception room,
and myself In a room next to Mr. Tolson's Office. He requested me to draw
a diagram of the suite of offices showing the entrances thereto, which I did.

He asked me about the file cabinets in these offices and whether there were
any cabinets in Mr. Felt's Office. He asked me whether I took any dictation
from Mr. Felt and I told him Mr. Felt dictated to his secretary, Miss Tschudy.

He then asked me what Expedite Processing meant. I told him this
meant that the more important matters were processed and recorded by the
Files Division than the lesser important mail. In other words, this meant by
processing the more important mail first, this category of mail would have
action taken on it before the lesser important mail was acted on.

He then asked me about the abstracts, and who prepared them. I told
him abstracts were prepared on all correspondence; that when I first went to
the FBI the stenographers would prepare them but that was changed and the
individuals dictating the correspondence would dictate the abstracts. He
commented that he thought the abstracts were a very good system.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if Mr. Tolson would ever get any letters
makkéd "personal and Confidential" from any of the Agents or Agents in Charge"
and I told him occasionally he did. He wanted to know what happened to them
and I told him as far as I knew they went to the Files Section. He also asked
if Mr. Hoover ever received any and I told him that any he routed around
for Mr. .Tolson to see were sent back to Mr. Hoover by Mr. Tolson and I
could not say what happened to them after they were sent back.

He asked me if anyopapers were sent to Mr. Tolson by Mr. Hoover

\euOLOsURY te fl EPFL Sue,



marked "OC" and I told him I never saw any.

Mr. Gittenstein questioned me at great length about the Executives
Conferences, how often they were held, who attended them, and who dictated
the Executive Conference memoranda. I told him they were generally held
about once a week, but sometimes only when there were special matters
to be discussed. I told him they were attended by the Assistants to the
Director and the Assistant Directors or by their alternates and that they
were held in Mr. Tolson's office. I told him the individual who had matters
to be discussed dictated the memorandum, which covered all matters
discussed at the conference. He asked whether Mr. Hoover attended these
conferences and I told him he did not. He asked where these Memoranda
were kept and I told him they were kept in the Files Division. Theré was
considerable discussion about these memoranda. Mr. Gittensteintold me
this was necessary as there was considerable confusion as to these memoranda
and confidential matters.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if I made a log of Mr. Tolson's appointments
like the Director's Telephone Room Did. I told him I did not, as Mr. Tolson
did not make any appointments; thgt Mr. Tolson was extremely busy all the
time and when he had any matters to discuss with anyone, he would either
call them on the intercom system or have me call them to come to his office
to see him.

He asked me about the cabinets in the Director's office and if I knew
what they contained. I told him I did not. He asked me about the index cards
in Miss Gandy's office. I told him I would occasionally ask about personal
friends of Mr. Hoover and Mr. Tolson and whether they were written on a
first name basis.

He asked when Mr. Hoover was out of town did Mr. Tolson take over
his duties. I told him they were generally away at the same time. He asked
me If Mr. Felt took over Mr. Tolson's office at those times cand T said he did.

He asked me if Miss Gandy and I were friends and I told him we were
official friends but I did not have any outside contacts with her. He asked me
if Miss Gandy discussed any confidential matters with me and I said she did not.

—

? Mr. Felt's office after(Mr. Tolsondied. I told him I did not as I was
' extremely busywriting eve undl closing out Mr. Tolson's office and did
not pay any attention to anything else. He wanted to know if Mr. Felt occupied
Mr. Tolson's office and I told him he did not until after I retired on June 12, 1972.

Mr. tice atx. ols if I saw any boxes at all brought into

NW 55031 DocId:32989612 Page 265



Mr. Gittenstein asked me how many rooms there were in Mr. Hoover's
house and I gave him this information. He asked me if there were any cabinets

in the first and second floors of the house and I told him there were not. He
then asked me about the cabinets in the Recreation Room and what they
contained. I told him there were cabinets containing 8 drawers and that
these cabinets were used for and contained Mr. Tolson's personal papers

and nothing official. I told him there were two cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's

personal investmehts: that I had occasion to use these files in connection with

his investments and his estate and, in answer to questions from Mr. Gittenstein
and Miss D'Oreo, I told them I did not see any official papers in these cabinets.

Mr. Gittenstein said he understood there were a great number of
boxes in the Recreation Room and he asked me if I knew what they contained
and what happened to them. I asked him if I could get some guidance from
Mr. Mohr on this matter, as Mr. Mohr accompanied me to the meéting.
Mr. Mohr told me he was there when the appraisers came to appraise the
contents of Mr. Hoover's house in connection with the settlement of his
estate that he was with the appraisers the entire time they were opening
the boxes, that he saw what each box contained, and that the boxes and their
contents were sent to Sloans for auction sale.

There was considerable discussion as to what Miss Gandy did while
Iwas there. I again told them I did not go to Mr. Hoover's house until
after I retired and I thought my first day there was June 14, 1972. I told
them I had a month's accumulation of work and was extremely busy; that
I worked at a desk with my back toward Miss Gandy; that I knew she was
working on some papers on the table where she was sitting but I did not
know what they consisted of and I did not ask her as I did not consider it
any of my business. My function was strictly to take care of Mr. Tolson's
personal matters. Miss D'Oreo did considerable discussion about this
matter. She asked me if Miss Gandy was destroying any papers. I said
she was putting some papers on her table into a cardboard box. She asked
me where the papers came from and I said I did not know as Miss Gandy
was there before I arrived and she had her work on the table at that time.
She wanted to know whether the papers were in manila folders and whether
the folders were marked as to their contents. I told her I thought there was
some typing on the tab of the folders but I did not know or read any of the
typing. She asked me if from my knowledge of regular Bureau files whether
any of her papers consisted of official Bureau files. I told her I saw no
official files whatsoever. She asked me if I ever saw Miss Gandy go into the
two file cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's personal papers. As I could
see these files from my desk I told her I could definitely say I never saw her

go into these files. I again stressed the fact that I had never been to Mr. Hoover's

house until June 14, 1972 and I only went there once a week and that I only

saw Miss Gandy about three or four times after I first went there. Miss D'Oreo

again asked me if there were any official papers in the cabinets containing
Mr. Hoover's personal investments and I told her that in my references to

ror sadhesg tiles 5 dig.not gee any. official papers.



ey | e

Mr. Gittenstein. asked if I discussed the closing of Mr. Tolson's
office after his death with Mr. Mohr and I told him I did not as I took
care of this matter myself. He asked me what the cabinets in Mr. Tolson's
office contained and whether he kept any official papers or any manifolds
in his office. I told him Mr. Tolson had no cabinets in his office and that
he kept no official papers or manifolds there. I told him the cabinets
were in my office. He asked me what the cabinets in my office contained
andItold him. I advised him they contained tickler copies of letters
which I had written but which I destroyed ascopies of the same were in
the FBI files and the rest of the material consisted of copies of his income
tax returns, his stock investments and his oil investments, all of which
I packaged and sent to Mr. Tolson at Mr. Hoover's house. He asked me
if I took them or who did take them and I told him it was someone from
the Supply Section. He asked me when these boxes of Mr. Tolson's
personal matters were sent to Mr. Hoover's house and I told him just
before June 12, 19175, when I retired.

He asked me whether there was a garage on the premises and
I told him there was. He asked whether there were any file cabinets
in the garage. I told him I had never been in the garage and assumed
there were only implements stored there.

Miss D'Oreo asked whether there were any cabinets in the
atti¢. I told her I had not been in the attic, that I only went up a
few steps to the attick to ask James E. Crawford, one of Mr, Tolson's
employees, a question but did not go all the way up to the attic.

Respectfully,

The Attorney General

HOTE CONTINUED:

this paper is an internal deliberative document and recommended
‘ it be withheld from the Committee. In the face of an adverse
ruling by the AG, we recommended by letter to the AG and LHM
dated June 4, 1975, that access to the paper for review at
FBIHQ be allowed with the stipulation that no notes would be
taken during the initial review. We stated at that time that
should the arrangement be unsatisfactory to the Committee, we
would consider further request for the document. Committee
Staff Member Mark Gitenstein has completed the initial review
under the conditions which we imposed. The Committee Staff
has renewed their request that the paper be made available
to them and their request has been sustained by Mr. K, William
{O'Connor of the Department, Under these circumstances, it “is
no longer practical to continue our objections.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any
type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-
ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to
avoid needless repetition of previous instructions.

(B) UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SECTION -- A reduction in the number of
Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it
necessary that the time of the remainder be utilized most efficiently to
permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies. It is de-
sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by
Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and
will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to
a high-ranking official of another agency, if its sensitivity requires
spetial tiandling, or if its content requires some on or comment
In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv-
ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda to other Govern-
ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not
,of the Liaison Section. Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether
such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by
regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred
to as form routing slips, contain blocks to be checked which will inform
the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other
agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the
case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-
nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-
‘times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether
further material may be expécted, resulting in later inquiry from the-ad-
dressee, It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

6 eo!

If a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally
to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-
head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral
dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking
"please handle" or ‘please pass information to --."

Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four
agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai-
son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re-
quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con-
tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda
discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider-
ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison
representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts
concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.
Matters involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-
ated, wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset. .

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

When “the Wumbex” ‘one ‘Man vis working outside the office the
Section Chief will be‘present to run the Section and when he
is outside working the Number One Man will handle the Section.

| The remainder of the Section will be comprised of

two supervisors handling supervision of all foreign offices,

Cooperation matters, and coordination of the Bureau's defense

| planning; three Agents handling supervision of all security
informant matters in the U. S.; and one_Agent supervising
{foreign informants and contacts, and the border coverage program.

I believe strongly that this is the barest minimum
4 number with which the Section can operate under the revised
program because even as projected, the Number One Man and the
Section Chief will be engaged in active liaison outside the
office for substantial periods of time, Although the plan
outlined above represents a drastic reduction in personnel,
I am confident that by the concerted and extra efforts of those
remaining, we can continue the suggested revised program of
operation.

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I ee ‘carefully looked iitto ‘dis -

attached) and have conferred a various: Bureau officials. 4

The Director eaean liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President]
and National Security Council. Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies}
™ being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison
_ with State, Air Force, Army, Navy, Secret Service, Internal Revenue and Civil
i Service. DD feels that some disadvantage or possible aa could result from
«su«J discontinuance of liaison with these key agencies,

At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously —
we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and
take such stens as are necessary to solve them We can always modify our

ioe, PrOcedures when it is in the Bureau's interests to do so. Furthermore, there appear
H to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be
: handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con-
‘ firmation in writing if necessary. Emergency or * unusually delicate situations can
"be handled by direct contact.

For above reasons, we should immediate? yeeas continue liaison service
with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council.
‘Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular ‘courier service will provide
expedite transmission, An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can

I would appreciate your observations and recom-
mendation on the following suggestion:

For many years, FBIHQ had a Liaison Section
which maintained official liaison with the head-
quarters of other governmental departments and
agencies in Washington, D. C. The discontinuance
of that Liaison Section resulted in an attempt by
the Washington Field Office to handle many inquiries
of high-level officials of those departments and
agencies. It should be noted, of course, that this
office of necessity maintains liaison on a relatively
low level with all governmental departments and
agencies to insure the prompt referral of cases and
to handle matters pertaining to the effective
operation of this office in the District of Columbia.
I feel-+that a reinstitution of the Liaison Section
in FBIHQ would glace the high level Jiaison with
other agencies at the headquarters level where it
would obviously be more effective, -

You requested my observations and ‘recommendations with ae
to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section,

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time
necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled
by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various
levels at tle Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies,
When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented
awaste of manpower, 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged
in handling domestic liaispn with some 8i different agencies, many of which
obviously were of minor importance to our operations, Since that time necessary ©
liaison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Office as you indicated as
by supervisors and officials in FBIHQ, Washington Field Office's liaison with
=wen other agencies relates almost entirely to the handling of leads and the Bureau's
routine business with those agencies.
: | [believe we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business
with the other major Federal agencies if we re-established a Liaison Unit of limited
: size to handle only those agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic,
: I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of the existing Special ssiniaiveniasesoul
jot (L. F, Schwartz); :

Memo for Mr, Kinley
Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C. Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State ~ o.

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Treasury Departnfent and related agencies with exception of
Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

U. S. Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures
Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

National Secutity Agency
Atomic Energy Commission
U. S. Postal Service
Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling
the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle
the greater Volume of our business mating to other agencies, This Unit could be

effectively supervised by its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under
A, J. Decker, Jr., Chief and G, A, Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities
Intelligence Section. Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kind of
supervisimand administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison
matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section, Two other
supervisors in the Unit (R, A. Bermingham and H. C, Flemister, Jr.) would
./, ,continue to handle foreign liaison, to, which they are presently assigned, including .
the supervision of Legat operations. A third Agent would need to be added for
supervision of. ‘foreign liaison. to-replace’ Rachner ; -who is ROW engaged fas these -

RECOMMENDATION:

: That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organized
’’ along-the’ lines indicated above with Unit Chief Schwartz; 5 Agents handling domestic
. ;liaison;.and.three Agents.to handle foreign. liaison, . If approved, this would require:
the assignment of three additional Agents to this Unit,

LIAISON SECTION: -

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives
was not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison
Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility
continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in
the same mahner as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.
This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of
the Bureau's domestic liaison onerations,

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through
the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U. 8.
agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those
agencies was accomplished promptly, effectively, economically,
and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems,
By the establishpent of effective liaison contacts, we sought
to recognize and solve minor problems before they became
major problems requiring protracted and/expendive negotiations

their operations and established a close personal rapport with
high-level officials in those agencies, For exampl¢, in matters
of major importance the liaison Agent could make immediate
personal contact withiCabinet officers, directors of bureaus and
many other officials of the highest level, When our investiga-
~~ tions required interviews of persons of this caliber, the inter

views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the
interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a
minimum of inconvenience to the official involved, Many of these
high-level contacts were the result of years of development by
the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we were able
to obtain assistance which might otherwise have been difficult

or impossible to obtain, Some examples of this type of support
are the following: :

National Security Agency~One of the Bureau's
Secure telephone systems was provided and
installed by this Agency at no cost to the
Bureau, a savings of approximately $150,000,
Through*high-levol contacts in this Agency, :
we have also been able to secure the results
of its technical research which might have
been difficult or expensive to obtain through
other sources,

Post Office-Our close association with the
Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials
ht has resulted in that agency providing support
in some of our most delicate intelligence
operations looking to the identification of
illegal hostile intelligence activities in
this country, -

State Department~In addition to providing
at no cost to the Bureau another secure :
telephone network.and making available to. the ¢
Bureau worldwide cable facilities of the State
Department, our -high«level contacts in this. ...
epartméent have-on many ‘oceasions assisted in,.

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence

agencies have consistently provided excellent -

support to the Bureau in both the security and.

criminal fields. Much of this is due to the

high-level liaison contacts developed over the

years with these agencies. In the Yablonsky

murder case, the military provided, on very

short notice at no cost to the Bureau, an

expert diving team which was able to locate

one of the weapons involved which was an

essential piece of evidence in this crime.

Likewise, the military has been able to provide

a wealth of deceptive information to be used

in our double agent operations directed against
- Soviet-bloc intelligence agencies.

Immigration and Naturalization Service-

Through high-level contacts with this Service,

we have been able to arrange with a minimum of
complicated paper work the speedy deportation

of persons entering the United States who are
consideréd to be threats to the internal security,
such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States
on assassination missions.

In many other instances, through close established
liaison, we were able to avoid the development of situations
in other agencies which could have resulted in operational
problems for the Bureau, Our liaison, for example, with the
President's Commission on the Causes and Prevention of
Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance
_information concerning possible publications or statements 7
by those commissions which could have reflected adversely
on the Bureau.

Memorandum E, S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit .

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while
Similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison
Section, are necessarily.less broad and are directed more
towards facilitating the resolution of problems raised by
other agencies than producing effective action by other
agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to
the Special Coordination Unit are handling our domestic
liaison work. One of these is assigned to liaison with
The White House, the Vice President, and the National Security
Council. He is backed up by the other Agent who also attends
meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the
Unit Chief in handling inquiries from other agencies doing
business with the Bureau.

We have been able in our current system to carry
on an effective liaison operation primarily because of the
quality and number of high-level contacts which had been
developed under the previous Liaison Section system.
Although effective, this has really been a holding operation
largely dependent upon the existing reservoir of well
developéd contacts. Due to transfers and retirements in
the most important agencies with which we do business, our
established contacts have been deteriorating so that we
are approaching the point of diminishing returns. This

- situation could be reversed if we had sufficient man power .

to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and
establish new ones,

Re: LIAISON SECTION :

Costs

. In measuring the cost of a domestic liaison operation,
the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel
involved. Liaison Ageyts are normally selected from among
Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25,583-$33,260); that is, men
who have the ability and experience required to handle a

Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based

on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison
of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and

the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these
figures, it should be recognized that the Section Chief and
Number One Man in the former Liaison Section, and the Unit
Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only
part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised
the coordination of our offices abroad and the investigation

of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in

the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us
abroad, The former Liaison Section also handled other

matters, now absorbed elsewhere, such as emergency planning

and the Bureau's participation in the NATO Special Committee,

such as savings in reduced paper work, savings in man hours
of consultation, savings in the elimination of unnecessary
or duplicative investigative effort and, of overriding
importance, the increasing of our operational effectiveness
through the establishment of good will With other agencies.
These savings offset to a considerable degree the increased
salary expenditure.

Conclusion

Although we enjoy a strong operational relationship
with other agencies, including the intelligence agencies,
wherein in many instances we have face-to-face meetings at
the desk level with counterparts in other agencies, we
believe that from the overall standpoint the Bureau can
profit from the assignment of three additional Liaison Agents
to this work. We are not recommending that we enter into
liaison functions as broadly as we were engaged in the past
as we believe such an expenditure would not be justified,
What we are recommending is the assignment of one-half the
personnel which had previously been assigned to direct
liaison functions at less than one-half the previous cost,

ACTION:

ADDENDUM OF W. M. FELT _ 7-19-72 mn

Irecommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the
restricted basis outlined.above. The Liaison Section should maintain
smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-
munity and related departments. We would not change in any way very
effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget
Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in
connection with hijackings and security matters, etc. This action would
eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would
set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that
we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard.against
it becoming a mail courier operation.

I recommend the re-establishment of the Liaison Section
and the adding of three additional agents to implement this. _

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. W. M. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with
those agencies. In similar fashion the British jill not furnish derogatory(S)
information directly to the Department of Defense in connection with its’
background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled
through FBI. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison
-matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same
supervision,

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the

operations of several U. S. agencies and require domestic liaison with those
agencies, Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance
of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is
essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order
to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very
slowly. [Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence
A CTA) stations abroad.

‘They frequently, however, suggest
to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items. These
can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison
supervisor.( In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with Cs
local representatives of the U. S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat
which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate
military headquarters,

Liaison, or, in éther terms, the establishment of a harmonious
relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.
I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations
closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area. This has proved
to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that
the re-establishment of limited direct liaison in Washington should be handled

by. the same supervision which. has been given to our posts abroad, -The-work in -

both areas is primarily intelligence oriented, yet does not fall within the

SuJECT LIAISON SECTION: *
Since I think my Sear iS you may possibly be
the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your

order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this
memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion.

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a
Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section
as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison
Section had operated, according to my understanding.

Specificaiiy, { recommended that the reconstituted Section should |
have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and should not
oper ellige ision (DID). I suggested that
the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an
appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference ‘meeting,

Supervision of foreign Legats, which supervision had been
included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,
under my proposat, continue to be handled within the DID and thus would
not be handled by the reconstituted Liaison Section.

Your order reestablishing the Section appears to contemplate
that the new Section will operate out of the DID. If this is your intention,
then there is no reason why, in my opinion, the Section should not also be
permitted to supervise foreign Legats. The only reason for my recommen-
dation to you that the new Section not supervise foreign Legats was my
parallel recommendation that the new Section be located elsewhere than
the DID.

*Re; LIAISON SECTION

directly administering the present limited liaison, the foreign office
supervision, and the FPC matters, Schwartz was assigned to the previ-
ous Liaison Section and has an unusually wide personal acquaintance
with both top and working level personnel in other U. S. agencies as
well as having represented the Bureau on several of the U. S. Intelli-
gence Board Committees. Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,
he was given a special citation by the U. S. Air Force in appreciation
for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service,
Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls from
other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his
relationship with other agencies, In addition to a highly successful
and productive career at Headquarters, Schwartz directly supervised

in the New York Office the then highly important investigation of the
New York State Communist Party and its membership prior to his assign-
ment in Washington,

caliber and, in fact, most have already served in that position.
Further, liaison is not conducted inside the office and we believe

by other divisions and will not attempt to handle liaison across the

ters of mutual interest with us and with which problems are. most apt
to arise, The earlier memorandum, which is attached, submitted con-
“SF cerning this matter outlined this in some detail. Specific guidelines

ill be prepared and submitted for approval as soon as the new section
gets under way. Se eli ? fone VT Ta

In addition to the domestic liaison supervision, discussed
in detail above, the balance of the Section will, as approved by
Mr. Gray, be comprised of the present Foreign Liaison Desk consisting
of three Supervisors plus the necessary clerical personnel,. It is
recommended that SA Harvey C. Flemister, Jr., who was formerly the
SIc of the Foreign Liaison Unit in the discontinued Liaison Section
and who has acted as Senior Supervisor on the Foreign Liaison Desk
since that time, be again named as SIC of the Foreign Liaison Unit.
Flemister is well known and admired by the many contacts of our
foreign offices who visit Washington and he has a thorough knowledge
of foreign liaison matters.

SUBJECT: PERSONNEL CHANGES

You previously approved the establishment of a Liaison
Section and the purpose of this memorandum therefore is to submit
the names of candidates to fill the position of Chief of this Section.

On 10-11-72 available members of the Personnel Selection
Board met in my office, consisting of myself and Messrs. .Walters, Miller,
Bishop, Callahan, Dalbey, Jenkins, Conrad, Baker and Bates. In view of
the pending transfers of SACs Kunkel and McDermott, I did not invite them
to attend the meeting; however, in the future I intend to utilize the services
of nearby SACs.

_ With the exception of Assistant Director Baker, all members
have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of
preference, SA Graham A. Day, ASAC James J. Dunn, and SA Homer A.
Boynton. Mr. Baker recommended, in his order of preference, SA Boynton,
ASAC Dunn and SA Day.

1. SA SA Graham A. Day, No. 1 Man, Nationalities Intelligence Section, DID.
He entered on duty 1-4-48, is in Grade GS-15, age 60, married, 2 children.
He reported to DID J1-11- 54, served as No., i Man of the former Liaison
Section from 3/61 until 7/70 ‘when the section was disbanded and since 5/10/72 q
has served in his current position. Mr. Day's age, length of service at FBIHQ,
. were carefully considered during the meeting; nevertheless, with the exception
of Mr. Baker, the others present, including me, feel that Day is without a
doubt the most qualified employee to fill this particular position. He has had
vast experience in liaison work and even in his current position has-continued _
:to-directly ‘supervise both domestic and foreign liaison functions. He has a

In line with the Pesci tcamett of the Liaison
7 Section, as approved by Mr. Gray in my memorandum of 10/19/72,
' -T am recommending that the 10 Supervisors assigned to this Section
l be given the title of Inspector with no change in pay for the
1 H duration of their liaison assignment and be authorized to use
| personal cards for official business as needed.

The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison
contacts for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis
of their background and experience to effectively represent the
Bureau at the highest levels of important foreign and domestic
agencies. All of, these men will be meeting freanently with US.
and foreign officials of the highest rank, which will include
Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and
foreign agencies.

f
jar”

In order to carry out their assignments in the most

effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men

be recognized as much as possible by the officials they are con-
tacting as key representatives of the FBI. This procedure has been
followed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives
handling our li&ison with Congress ahd the American Bar Association,
both of whom carry the title of Inspector. This has been found

to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling
their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be
equally helpful to the men of our new Liaison Section who have been
selected to handle our domestic and foreign liaison assignments.

Memorandum E.S. Miller to W. M. Felt E :
Re: Liaison Section 4

; : !
ADDENDUM ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION ae 11/24/72

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with
title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to
Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or
seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau
representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties

. requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the
Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.
Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as
much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to qualify them
for the temporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment
and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties ~
authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

a : . 7

[Nw 55031 DocId: 32989612 Page 337 9...


" ADDENDUM W.M,.FELT *: : 11-27-72:

I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic .
Intelligence and Administratiye Divisions as to the conferring of the title
Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section.
However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served
in the long run by taking favorable action. I am convinced that to accede
to this request would result in similar requests from other divisions, many
of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.
In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance
of the Inspector's title in the Bureau,

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from
such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him. Such action would
be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference
Act which specifically states 30 days advance written notice must be furnished
to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank. If we were to
advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only
for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the
law in giving the employee 30 days' advance written notice. Therefore, in
considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not given to the
recommendation. cee
