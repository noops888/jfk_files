3. Statements of former and current FBI oificials,

On November 15, 1974, Mr. C. D. DeLoach, former

Assistant to the Director, FBI, was telephonically contacted by an FBI

olficial and asked if he had any recollection concerning the briefing of

any Departmental official with regard to our Cointelpros, Mir. DeLoach

responded he had talked to former Attorney General Clark on several

occasions and discussed with him all phases of the operations of the

Intelligence Division of the FBI in which these programs were handled.

Vir. DeLoach stated he had briefed former Attorney General Clark not

only regarding the various Cointelpros but regarding even more sensi

tive matters.

Mr. DeLoach could not place any date of such briefings

but he recalled very specifically having so briefed the Attorney General.

Additionally, Mr. DeLoach stated it was his recollection

that tormer Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach knew about the

Cointelpro relating to the Eu Kus Klan but that he, lir. DeLoach, had

not personally briefed him regarding this matter. Mir. DeLoach said

former Aitorney General Batzenbach was possibly briefed by former

Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont or former Assistant to the

Director Williara C. Sullivan, Mir. DeLoach added he recalled very

clearly briefing former President Johnson regarding the Bureau's

activities against black militants in the United States, Mir. DeLoach

stated he was sure of the foregoing and would be glad to so testify.

On November IU, 19%1, lOrmer Assistant to the Direc-

Lot cohn Le wonr stated he vividly recalled on several occasions the

Director had furnished in detail information to the Subcommittee of

On November 18, 1974, Associate Dircctor Nicholas P.

Callahan, FBI, indicatca he, too, recalled thore were several instances,

craci dates not recalled, in which he accompanied former Director

Roover when the latter testified before the Subcommittee of the House

Appropriations Committee. Although lir. Callahan was not aole to

rccall specific dateo, he did recall oli-the-recorddiscussions with

members of the Committee and the questioning of the Director with

regard to the Bureau's efforts to neutralize groups and organizations.

12x. Callahan stated there was no critical comment made in regard

thereto,

4. Hearings before the House Subcommittee on

the isI Cointelpros was prepared for off-the-record use by former

Virector hoover in conneccion with six appcarances aciore tne house

Cubcommitteo on Appropriations between 1958 and 1000. Publiched

of the Seaboard White Citizens Council of Washington. As a

further aichto local law enforcement agencies, the FBI has scheduled a series

of special conferences for November and December, 1958, to discuss our

cooperative services regarding bombings and threats of bombings against

religious and educational institutions

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to be interpreted

as an attempt on our part to usurp the jurisdiction of local authorities.

To give the

FBI this jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the basic responsibility

to maintain law and order, and the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the

local level.

To counteract a resurgence of Communist Party influence in the

United States; we have a seventh program designed to intensify any confusion

and dissatisfaction among its member's.

During the past few years, this program

has been most effective.

Selected informants were briefed and trained to

raise controversial issues within the Party. In the process, many were able

to advance themselves to higher positions. The Internal Revenue Service was

furnished the names and addresses of Party functionaries who had been active

in the underground apparatus. Based on this information, investigations were

instituted in 262 possible income tax evasion cases. Anticommunist literature

and simulated Party documents were mailed anonymously to carefully chosen

members.

Two of our anticommunist pamphlets were sent to the Soviet Union

by the Party as evidence of the problems it faces in this country.

These programs are part of our over-all counterintelligence,

operations. They are specific answers to specific problems which have arises

within our investigative jurisdiction.

You may have noticed, however, during

my comments regarding communism and espionage, the constantly recurring

theme of passports. They present a problem in all of our counterintelligence work.

i sin the

Fraudulent passports have, traditionally, been standard equipment for spies and

subversives. In November, 1957, a Sovtet/woman spy entered the United States

after adopting the identity of an American citizen who had returned behind the

Iron Curtain.

In the Abel case, both Abel and his principal accomplice,

Reino Hayhanen, also entered the country with fraudulent passports.

Soviet spies have been assuming the identities of Americans who died in

infancy. The names of these infants are easily obtained from public records, and

we are currently reviewing these sources to identify espionage agents who have

adopted this practices, Regently, the Soviets have also displayed unusual interest,

in securing such dosuments as high school and college diplomas, social security

cards, drivers' licenses, and selective service registrations.

With a fictitious

identity supported by such documents, it is relatively simple to obtain a

United States passport.

Pursuant to W. O. Cregar to Mr. W. R. Wannall

memorandum 4/8/75 "Senstudy 75 (Request for temporary use of

Miss Frances M. Korb), " Miss Korb reported to the INTD 4/22/75

on temporary assignment in the CI-2 Section (actually working on

Senstudy 75 Project). Miss Korb, antemployee of WFO, reported

to the Legal Counsel Division 3/24/75 for temporary assignment in

the Freedom of Information Act Unit. This temporary assignment

was changed to INTD 4/22/75 and for continuance in her duties in

INTD with the Senstudy 75 Project, a position description to facilitate

her permanent transfer to the Project would normally be required

after 120 days from 3/24/75, or by 7/21/75.

Miss Korb is currently on extended annual leave (from

6/13 - 7/11 -- total of 20 work days). In view of this extended period

of AL which actually covers a third of her Project assignment, it is

believed that her temporary assignment to the Project should be

extended for a similar period (20 work days) before the position

description need be prepared.

NOTE:

Original monograph outlining subversive connections

of King and other pertinent data was originally prepared and

disseminated at a high level in the Government 10/16/63. These

copies were subsequently retrieved because the Attorney General

felt they should be recalled. Subsequent revisions and updating

of the monograph were prepared and disseminated in 1964, 1967

and 1968.

Copies of Director Hoover's internal memoranda dated

11/7/63 and 2/5/64 being furnished the Attorney General and the

SSC have had data originally contained therein excised which is

This information deals generally

Birmingham, Alabama; off-the-record discussions relative to King's

communist affiliations with the Rooney Committee; a letter on

King prepared for the Attorney General; leaks by the press of data

on FBI cases; and personal comments.

Memorandum 12/17/64, from F. J. Baumgardner to l. C.

Sullivan, captioned "Communist Infiltration of SCLO, IS-G"

has

been excised to conceal source of information for data concerning

and identity of Cordy I. Vivian, Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) Director of Affiliates, a past member of the

Communist Party, USA. This memorandum also excised to delete name

of Senator Richard Russell (D-Georgia) who it was recommended be

advised concerning SCLC's utilization as a recruiter of blacks

to take part in the National Science Foundation program and the

cort in the sit nata

identity of the University of Mississippi as one of the schools

for which recruits were to be sought.

Memorandum C. D. Brennan to W. C. Sullivan dated 8/24/67

captioned "Martin Luther King, JI., SM-C" showing dissemination of

It is also noted that review of appropriate files in

SUBJECT:

COMMUNISVI AND THE NEGRO MOVEMENT --

A CURRENT ANALYSIS

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

The enclösed article,

one we have been preparing in line with approval of our

recommendation to disseminate it on a select basis at a

very high level to show current communist activities in

Ielation to the Negro movement.

It incorporates up-to-date

material just received from our New York Office relating

to the recent meeting of the Communist Party's National

•Executive Committee.

Discussion of racial matters was a

primary topic at the week-long meeting.

The enclosed article is a factual, documented

analysis of the over-all current situation.

We believe

that it would be of interast not

to the Attorney Concial

but also to Mr. O'Donnell, at the White House; MI. MoCone, at

the Central Intelligence Agency; Mr. Rusk, at the Department

of State; as well as to Mr. McNamara and the three Armed Forces

intelligence agencies of the Defense Department. Accordingly,

II the article as prepared is approved,

we propose to dis-

seminate it to the afore-mentioned individuals and agencies.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the enclosed article be approved. If approvea;

it should be returned to the Domestic Intelligence Division

for preparation of appropriate letters of transmittal.

• The attached analysis of

Gandy

Communism and the Negro Movement is

highly explosive. It can be regarded as

la personal attack on Martin Luther/King.

"There is no doubt it will have a heavy

i impact on the Attorney General and anyone

else to whom we disseminate it. It is

labeled TOP SECRET.

However, even such a

high classification

seems to

be no bar

today to a leak,

and should this leak out

it will add fuel to a matter which may

already be in the cards as a political

issue

during the forthcoming Presidential

campaign.

The memorandum makes good reading and

lis based on information from reliable sources."

We may well be charged, however, with

expressing opinions and conclusions, parti-

cularly with reference to some of the

statements about King.

We press dr or dusty;

This memorandum may startle the Attouney

General, particularly in view of his past

association with King, and the fact that we

are disseminating this outside the Department.

He may resent this.

Nevertheless, the

memorandum is a powerful warning against

Communist influence in the

Negro movement.

and we wiTl be carrying

out our responsibility

¡in/the attached memorandu ori?

by disseminating it to the people indicated

SUBJECT:

COMMUNISM AND THE

NEGRO MOVEMENT

The Attorney General telephoned at approximately 10:15 a.m.

He'advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out oi

the building: The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Army.

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about tre l

communist activities of Martin Luther king. The Attorney General was resear

to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Current.

Analyses," dated October 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report

to which he is referring, although he persisted on calling it the report on the

communist background of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney General said he would like to know what other

dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose

for such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to ask if the

Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney General tizzi

obviously the

Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him perschally:

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did noi

concern matters of suîficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's persosi

attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

in matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction, and that

dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well

as other top governmental officials because of responsibilities they have in this

(connection.

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King.

I told the Attorney

General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in commis

activities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to se

¡called on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability

*of the civilian authorities.

496-21100-3-116-480

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.

The Attorney Genet=

said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's

communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the disse

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it see disco monace

The Attorney General called and advised me, there was

a lot of talk at the Pentagon regarding the document, Communism

and the Negro-"A "Cürrent Analysis, dated 10-16-63, which haà

boon disseminated to the military and intelligence agencies by the

Bureau. The Attorney General anticipated that this information

would leak out as the military didn't like the Negroes.

The Attorney General felt we should get back all copies

of the document. I told him we had a tally of all copies and we

would get them from all agencies to which they were disseminated.

The reason to be given for recalling wouid be revisions. I also

told him if any newspapers asked about this, no comment would be

made and no mention would be made that such a document existed.

4:40 p.т.

I advised the Attorney General that Liaison repre-

sentatives had been sent to get all copies of this document.

The Attorney General wants all copies disseminated to

Department officials recalled also. •

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON

MA. BELMONT

MR. ROSEN

MR. SULLIVAN

SIR. DE LOACH

ME. EVANS

The httorney General called and stated ho had heard that thege has

been some discussion about a report on Martia luther Xing before thel oongy

Committse and also some discussion about the Department of Justice wanted

to recall that report and he, the Attornay General, wanted to recall our con-

versation about it because someone got the impression he, the attorney General

requestad it be recalled. I told the Attorney General that the only discussion

before the looney Committes was off the record, that thare was inquiry off

the record as to the association of Martin luther fing with the Communist

movement and I reviewed the information that we had developed in the monogram

and said copies of the monograph had been deliverad to the Secretary oi Defenza

who Secretary o state, and the White House, and that it was later recalled

because it was feared it taight leak out. I stated one of the members of the

Committee, & Ropublican, mado the statement he thought it ought to be exposed,

and Chairman Rooney said he thought laformation of that kind should be

kept in the kack af the head rather than come out as public information. I

stated I made the remark that that was the intention in recalling the document.

The Attorney Ceneral stated he understands that thay are saying he had requestet-

it ba withdrawn. I stated it was nothiny of the kind; that in other words hs,

the Attorney Ceneral, and I had talked aboat it several times and he had

questloned the wisdom of its distribution and 1 indicated I would have the

withdrawn and I did. The Attorney General stated he did not want to hat

idea that he had roquestod it. I stated both a us had leared a loal migh

139

get

out from the Departments which had capies-ol the monograph; and il it

happened during a sensittre time of negotiations going on with the Negro

leaders, it would have caused a rucius insotar as

Fing was concorned.

The Attorney Ceneral sald another; thing he was calling about is that

it, DeLoach said to Ed Gathman that the Attorney Ceneral should be concerned

abdit the lotter written about Fing and spealing on behali of the fEI, l taey

were be, the attorney Caneral, they would be concerned. The Attorney fencial

stated he did not know what is going on with this thing, that he just knew the

letter wes cloared with the FBI bafore li was sent. I stated I did not know

what the letter is, that I would chees on it because that is a new development

I had not heard about. The Attorney General stated that just last weekend he

heard that there was apparently some conspiracy on the part of President

Kennedy and himsalt in connection with this; that he did not mind it coming out,

but he wanted the facts. I stated there was no discussion on the record at all,

it was all off the record and as l had stated, there was one member who thought

this information about ting ought to be oxposed and riconey spoke up that it is

better at times to have ratters of this kind in the back of the head rather than

have it leak out or be disseminated, and i stated that was the intention of

recalling the document. The Attoroy General statod he remieranored the

conversation we had had. I stated in regard to this matter of some letter

that DeLoach mentioned, I did not know what that is aboat and I would talk to

Deloach about it and check on it.

10:00 AM

I called the Attorney General and advised him I spoke to Daleach

about it and be emphatically denias he made iny such statement to Cuthman;

De loach said Guthman came around to ste him yesterday about the fact the

press is gatting information regarding artis Luther ling which concerned

hi:a. Deloach says hie remart was it also concerned us because it laperils

any sourcos of information we might have. & continued that there was a

reporter in Atlanta who, I believe, arrived in Washington yesterday and who

18 doing an article for the Saturday Evening lost exposing King; that while

he was in Atlanta ho mado the statement down there concorning O'Dell'a

connection with the Coumunist Farty and was concerned about Lavison

writing king's speeches and he was then coning on to Washington to see the

Dapartment people here to supplement this oi get any additional information

he could. I stated that gives us great concera because of the fact what

Levison does, that is a highly conidential matter from one oi our informants

"who la assoclated with Levison. I stated there has been a leal somewhere

concerning that particular thing, but at no time was any relorence made

concerning the fact that is, the Attorney Genaral, should be concerned about

any letter he wrote.

The Attorney General stated he is concerned about that as he

understocd i was. He stated a lot ai these thrgs seem to be conting out la

the pagers shica

attributed it to us - that when you read the thing, it wonds as though everythia,

was furnished by the i21 when in reality Paarson could not get inside any door a

the Eareas as he is held in contempt by everybody in the Bureau. I stated

Pearson bangs it on to the y'DI as 11 it emaraied froin us. I stated Fearson

did the saie thing in regard to the assassination of the tresicent, that he

attribated certain information to the rel walan, as a mattor of lack, ho got

from tarl warren himosli. I stated Fearson and Warren are close Irleads;

they travel together and spend vacations together. I stated I had been tipped

off in astance that fearson was writing à colma critical di tho Bureau 215

giving intorration regarding the lee Harrey Cowald Case and Icarson Lase.

It appear we were leaking Information when as a matter of fact nothing ever.

was leaired out until aitor the report loit the Bureau and then thinzs began

leating out. I stated a lot leaked out in Dallas frora the Folice Department,

walch was doing a lot of talking about tho evidence they sent us lika the

& report to the Dallas Police Depart rent and tha Chial then went on TV 221

is involved in the Dobby Eaker case when, in fact, copies oi our resortg a

influence in the Negro movement with emphasis on Martin Luther King, JI.

This paper is an up-to-date revision of the one by the same title prepared

under the date of October 16, 1963.

In updating it we emphasized three

main areas: (1) the continued dependence of King upon former Communist

Party, USA members, current and former Party sympathizers and his continued

reliance on the long-time communist Stanley David Levison; (2) facts

relating to the moral degeneracy oi King; and (3) the recent and current

Party aims and activities relative to the racial movement:

RECCHLONDATION:

Upon approval, consideration will be given to appropriate dissemina-

tion.* When approved, the paper should be returned to the Domestic

Intelligence Division for printing and the preparation of appropriate

letters if disseminated.

COMUNIST INFILTRATION OF

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

Break.

This memorandum recommends that the National Sclence

Foundation (NSF) be furnished information concerning the

communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCIC) and Its President, Dr. Martin Luther King,

Jx':

This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by

• the

NSF for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools:

AT 1382-S* has furnished information that Coxdy T.

Vivian, SCIC Director of Affiliates,, was advised that the NSt

desired qualified

applicants to enter the University of Mississippi

and other schools in southern states where the NSF has its

program in progress.

Vivian was advised that the NSE was

contacting organizations such as the SCIC and othei civil rights

groups to handle the recruitment biogram fun iegio Students 5in0e

did not want it to appear that the NSr was attempting to

put Negro applicants

in southern schools.

Vivian was advised that each qualified applicant

Fould receive a $3, 000 scholarship from the NSt. Since this

is a Government project any expenses incurred in this matter

"would not come out of anyone's pocket."

This would indicate

that any expenses incurred by the SCIC in their recruitment

effort would be paid for with Government funds.

The communist influences exerted on King are well

known. to the Bureau.

Vivian has in the past been a member

of the Communist Party.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is incredible that an outfit such as the SCIC

should be utilized for the purpose of recruiting Negroes to

take part in the NSF program, particularly where funds of the

Memorandum to W. C. Sullivan

From E. J. Baumgardner

RE: COMMUNIST INFIITRATION OF

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

100-438794

U. S. Government are involved, The Atlanta Office has

recommended that Senator Richard Russell (D. Georgia) be

advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable

since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the

South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J. Haworth, Director,

NSF, should be furnished information regarding communist

influences exerted

on the SCiC and

King.

In this regard

we recently disseminated to the White House and the

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

summary

entitled

"Communism and the Negro lovement-A

Current Analysis" which contains information

SCIC and king.

This summary deals with King's communist

connections and his personal immoral activities. With the

receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the scIC would

undoubtedly be removed crom the ist jrogzan io obtain guarddled

Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation •

in the NSF program is being separately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies:

RECOMMENDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to

Dr. Leland do Haworth, Director, Asr, Exansmitting a copy

of the recently prepared summary entitled "Communism and

the Negro Movement-A Current Analysis."

You will recall that in December, 1964,

with

the

Director's approval and after first checking with the White

House, we disseminated to the Heads of the intelligence

community a paper captioned as above which depicted the

communist influence in the Negro movement. Emphasis was

Cigar

given in the paper to the communist influences on Martin Luther

King,Jr., as well as facts relating to his immoral nature.

As you are aware, LeRoy Collins, former Governor of

Florida, is Director, Community Relations

Service (CRS),

Department of Conmerce, and in this position serves as

something

of a "mediator" in problems relating to the racial field.

He

has been a loy individual cIative to tho situûtion in Seimi,

Alabama:

Information of interest to the CRS is regularly being

disseminated to that agency.

He just received reliable info=-

mation concerning a conversation between Martin Luther King, JI.,

and

the

prejudice. We have disseminated the information concerning

the King conversation

to CRS.

It is believed that, in view of Collins' important

"benefit of the paper

or the tollenge conte

OUr IElI-

RECOMMENDATION:

he is a long-time admirer ca

the Director and the Burezu.

Attached for approval is a letter to Collins enclosing

BACKGROUND:

Krill

s/3n6

12/0;

On my recent inspection of the Legal Attache office

in Japan, I met and talked with ambasseder dohnson.

During

our conversation, it was quite apparent that Ambassador

Johnson was unaware of the communist influence being exerted

on Martin Luther King, Jr., and his group the Southern

Christian Leadership

Conference.

In November of 1964, interested officials of the

Government, including the Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary of

State, were furnished copies of the monograph

entitled,

Communism and the Negro Movement - A Current Analysis."

It is felt that Ambassador Johnson, because of his

position, should be made aware of communist infiltration into

King's group, and the influence being exerted on king.

Ambassador Johnson is a former Deputy Secretary of

State and has been extremely cooperative and helpful in the

past. By his remarks

it was

toward the Bureau and I feel that his discretion in handling

this document could be relied

RECOMMENDATION:

• REC42: -5-10:912-2807

That approval be granted to disseminate the above 1965

To obtain authorization for high level dissemination

ot a document captioned as above which shows the degree oi

¡communist influence on martin Luther King.

Enclosed is a document captioned as above, which

depicts communist influence in the civil rights field,

emphasizing the key role of Martin Luther King, Jr.

This

document is a current revision of the previous analysis

Ты,

captioned "Conmunism and the Negro Novement - A Current Analysis,

prepared and disseminated in November: 1964.

In undating it;

He have emphasized these areas:

(1)

continued reliance si King

upon former communist Party, Usa, members, particularly stanley :.?

David Levison; (2) jacts relating to King's moral degeneracy;-

and (ú) communist goal of uniting the peace and civil rights i

movements and King's adherence to this communist long-range i

objective.

King's strong criticism and condemnation of the

Administration's policy on Vietnam in a speech he made at New York

on 4/4/67 shows how much he has been influenced by communist

advisors. His speech was a direct parallel of the communist

position

on Vietnam.

It is felt that the President would be interested in

a summary on King which shows the degree of communist influence

on him.

The attached paper constitutes a complete picture and

I strong

indictment of King in that regard.

RECONMENDATIONS : :

It is recommended that

(1) The attached letters, with enclosures, to the

This is an excellent

suggestion and we have already

started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to

date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Wash-

ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level

officiels in Government of the wholly disreputable character

of King•

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was

originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our

Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

group is experiencing difficulty in recruiting individuals

-to participatein the demonstration and the date for the project

has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough job on .?

this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring together

the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it

in a hard-hitting manner.

To make the brief timely, we will

have it.completed and ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968.

i Counterintellirence Program

A highly specialized and aggressive program of counter-

Intelligence was initiated in 1956 for the purpose of exposing,

disrupting, discrediting, and otherwise neutralizing the Communis

Party-USA, and related organizations. Accumulated successes

achieved in our efforts directed against the communists under

sals progran, coupled with taerèased activity by the purveyors

of racial hate, varranted the expansion of the program in the

Fall of 1964 to include kian- and hate-type organizations and

their memberships. Counterintelligence action today is a valu-

able adjunct to investigative responsibilities and the technique

sised complement our Investigations. All information related to

the targeted organizations; their leadership and members, which

Is developed from a variety of sources, is carefully reviewed

for l'ts potential, for use under this program.

Examples of recent is upto a A

Through a variety of techniques, we have been able

to alert the oners of private meeting locations to the use.

of their premises by the Communist Party and Its Ironts. The

communists rarely use their organizational titles in renting

private halls, auditoriums,: pichic grounds, and the like, for

their rallies, propaganda, and fund-raising functions which

they endeavor to project as civic or social in nature. Often

an anonymous, letter, or directed publicity is sufficient to

alert the management of such locations, ard the communists must

necessarily expend time and expénse In efforts to find a new

site for their meetings.

Although still in its formative stages, our program

• directed against hate organizations is beginning to achieve

similar success. For example:

Communist Party leaders are hopeful that, by exploiting such current

pational and internationd issues as racial discrimination and peace, they can

bring about a resurgence of Party activity and influence.

For example,

(Benjatin Davis, chairman of the Party's New Fork District,

in a report made

in September of this year to top communist functionaries, stressed that the Party

should concentrate on the integration issue as symbolized by the Little Rock school

situation. Diligent efforts are made by the communists to infiltrate Negro groups,

particularly at the local level, so as to agitate and create confusion.

The public usually associates the FEI's internal security

investgations with Communist Party activities only.

Nothing could be

further from the truth.

Our investigations encompass any and all

organizations based on a creed of force and violence to determine whether

they are a threat to our internal security or whether they have violated

- any Fcderal laws.

in the early bombings there was no evidence to show that these bombings

could be attributable to specific organizations. Rather, they were individual

acts of terror strictly within the jurisdiction of local authorities. When these

outrages occurred, we in the FBI have made immediately available to local

authorities our laboratory and fingerprint facilities here in Washington.

As the bombings directed toward religious and educational facilities

continued, the FBI extended its cooperation to cover out-of-state leads which

local authorities could not handle.

We extended such assistance to the

Jacksonville, Florida, and Birmingham, Alabama, Police Departments

in connection with the bombings of a Jewish center and a Negro high school

Recognizing the danger to the national welfare from a general

the FSI has moved to expand its assistance

to local law enforcement in the recent bombings at Clinton, Atlanta, and

Peoria, Illinois. We are now providing all-out investigative assistance in

these cases.

We are closely checking the activities of individuals prominently

As a

further aid to local law enforcement agencies, the FBI has scheduled a series

cooperative services regarding bombings and threats of bombings against

religious and educational institutions

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to be interpreted

as an attempt on our part to usurp the jurisdiction of local authorities. To give the

FBI this jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the basic responsibility

to maintain law and order, and the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the

local level.

To counteract a resurgence of Communist Party influence in the

United States; we have a seventh program designed to intensify any confusion

and dissatisfaction among its member's.

During the past few years, this program

has been most effective.

Selected informants were briefed and trained to

raise controversial issues within the Party. In the process, many were able

to advance themselves to higher positions. The Internal Revenue Service was

furnished the names and addresses of Party functionaries who had been active

in the underground apparatus. Based on this information, investigations were

instituted in 262 possible income tax evasion cases. Anticommunist literatire

and simulated Party documents were mailed anonymously to carefully chosen

members.

Two of our anticommunist pamphlets were sent to the Soviet Union

by the Party as evidence of the problems it faced in this countsy.

These programs are part of our over-all counterintelligence,

operations. They are specific answers to specific problems which have arisen

within our investigative jurisdiction. You may have noticed, however, during

my comments regarding communism and espionage, the constantly recurring

theme of passports. They present a problem in all of our counterintelligence works

Fraudulent passports have, traditionally, been standard equipment for spies and

subversives. In November, 1957, a Savet woman spy entered the United States

after adopting the identity of an American citizen who had returned behind the

Iron Curtain.

In the Abel case, both Abel and his principal accomplice,

Reino Hayhanen, also entered the country with fraudulent passports.

Soviet spies have been assuming the identities of Americans who died in

infancy. The names of these infants are easily obtained from public records, and

we are currently reviewing these sources to identify espionage agents who have

adopted this pratices, Recenty, the Soviets have also displayed unusual interest

in securing such documents as high school and college diplomas, social security.

THE TIREAT

the conmunist Party, USA (CUSA) presents a greater

menace to the internal security of our Nation today than 1t

ever has since it was first founded in this country in 1919.

The dangerousness.of the CPUSA cannot be evaluated except in

the light of its relationship to the international communist

conspiracy and its ties to the Soviet Union. In this regard

It is woll to note that the rate of progress achieved by the

international conmunist offensive is unparalleled in history.

In the past 43 years, it has advanced steadily and suroly,

never varying its eventual goal of dominating the world,

until today lis empire extends fron Dast Germany to China.

This empire is so vast and sprawling that when night settles

on its wostern frontier, dawn already is breaking on its

eastern frontier.

controls one fourth of the land ares and approximately one

third of the inhabitants of the earth.

The CPUSA is a vital link in this worldwide con-

spiracy.

It utilizes elaborate security measures to conceal

its operations while vigorously promoting front groups as-well

as other concealed outlets in furtherance of its clandestine

pursuits.

It is completely dominated by and is subservient

to the Conmunist Party (C?) of the Soviet Union. This fact

has been made abundantly clear on a number of occasions, sone

of which are:

disseminate it to appropriate Goverment agencies and (2) to

the FBI was designated as the civilian intelligence agency

security.

Since that date,

it nas been the FBI's duty to

Dear Mr. Watson:

As you know, this Bureau has solved a number of cases

involving racial violence in the South. In this regard, public

attention particularly was focused on the FBI's role in the

solution of the brutal murders of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, Lieutenant

Colonel Lemuel A. Penn, and the three civil rights workers in

Mississippi.

Hovever, we have achieved a number of other tangible

accomplishments, most

of which are not publicly knows, and I

thought the President might be interested In them.

At the present time, for example, nearly two thousand

of our Informants and, sources

are being operated to obtain

up-to-date intelligence data concerning racial matters which we

disseminate on a continuing basis. Of, these, 174 have been

developed in just the past year-an avernge of more than two each

day for every day in the past twelve months.

Particularly significant has been the high-level

penetration we have achieved of Klan organizations. At the

present time, there are 14 Klan groups in existence. We have

penetrated every one of them through informants and currently

are operating informants in top-level positions of leadership in

seven of them.

Through such coverage, much valuable information

relating to a variety of cases of violence and planned violence

in the civil rights fiold has been obtained.

Just recently,

for example,

an informant secured and furnished to us the

seapon used in a civil rights shooting incident in North Carpiina.

BACKGROUND

Historically, the problem of the Ru Klux Klan in

the United States has existed since the days of Reconstruction

following the Civil War.

The Invisible Empire is well known

for 1ts terrorist, nightriding activities and has been respon-

sible since its inception for numerous racial atrocities

throughout the country. The Klan reached Its peak during the

don dut tone 11o5o me a dee become almost

In 1954, with the historic

Supreme Court decision regarding desegregation of public

schools, it became revitalized. In 1964, with the passage of

civil rights legislailuir by the Cougress, the Man récruited

thousands of persons who feared the rise of the Negro and

the threat to the "Southern way of life."

d.;.

The Klan has usually been located in the South al-

though there have been attempts to organize it in the North,

Midwest, and far West. The Klan attracts individuals in the

rural areas who are poorly educated with limited incomes.

The Kian exploits the fears, hatred, and ignorance of people

ano feel they are threatened by

the Negro, the Jew, the

Catholic, and the immigrant.

PRESENT STATUS

Presently there are 14 Klan organizations under :

investigation with a membership of approximately 14,000. The

largest of these groups, the United Klans of America, .Inc.,

Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, with Headquarters in Tuscaloosa,

Alabama, has an estimated membership of about 10,000.

The most

in recent years has been the White Knights of the Ku Klux

Klan of Mississippi under the leadership of Samar

BoNerS JAS of Laurel, Mississippi, who was recently con-

victed in connection with the murder of three civil rights

workers in Neshoba County, Mississippi, in June, 1964..

FBI RESPONSIBILITY

This 'Bureau has a three-fold purpose in investigating

the Ku Klux Klan and individuals associated with Klan organi-

zations.

First, we investigate violations of Federal law

committed by the klan with the view toward prosecution in

Federal court.

Second, we conduct intelligence investigations

with the view toward infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan with infor:

mants, neutralizing it as a terrorist organization, and deterring

violence. Third, we provide the Department with the results

of our investigations for possible designation of Klan organi-

zations under Executive Order 10450.

MAJOR CASES

Murder of Three Civil Rights Workers

In June, 1964, three civil right's workers were

murdered in Neshoba County, Mississippi, setting off an inten

sive FBI investigation. In October, 1967, 7 of 18 defendants:

were convicted in Federal court in Meridian, Mississippi, for

violation of the victims' civil rights. An 8th defendant

pleaded guilty and a mistrial was declared as to three other

defendants.. Our investigations revealed that there was a broa

Kil Klux Kian plot behind the abduction and murder of the victims.

Ku Klux Klan Investigations

Klan informants were used as witnesses in this trial and

they unfolded a story of Klan violence and terrorism rarely

presented in any court.

Murder of Vernon Dahmer

In January, 1966, Vernon F. Dahmer, a leader of

the National Association for the Advancement of Colored.

People in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, died as a result of

wounds received when his home was burned and shot into by

the Ku Klux Klan. Twelve klansmen have been indicted by

the Federal Grand Jury and the case is presently pending in

United States District Court at Hattiesburg. FBI informants

were instrumental in determining in the early stages of the

investigation that (Samuel Boyers and the member's of the

white Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi were

responsible for Dahmer's death.

Murder"of Lemuel Penn

In July, 1964, Lemuel Penn, an Army Reserve

Lieutenant Colonel and Negro educator from Washington, D. C.,

was killed by shotgun blasts near Colbert, Georgia. An exhaus-

tive investigation by this Bureau resulted in the arrest of

four members of the Ku Klux Klan.

Informants also played a

major role in this case. In October, 1964, a Federal Grand

Jury returned an indictment charging six men, including the

four arrested for Penn's murder, with conspiracy to injure,

oppress, and threaten to intimidate Negro citizens in the free

exercise of their Constitutional rights.

Two of the defendants

were convicted and four were acquitted.

was present at the time Mrs. Liuzzo was murdered. This case

dramatically emphasized our penetration of the Klan when it

was publically disclosed that Rowe was an FBI informant. The

three defendants were indicted by a Federal Grand Jury and

convicted in Federal court for conspiracy.

McComb, Mississippi, Bombings

From June through September, 1964, a series of

bombings occurred in McComb, Mississippi. After intensive

FBI investigation; nine members of the Ku Klux Klan were

arrested and charged with bombing homes and churches at McComb.

These nine klansmen entered pleas of guilty and nolo contendere

in local court: FBI informants were instrumehtal in uncovering

the plot and identifying suspects.

Now Born, North Carolina, Bombings

In early 1965, a strategically placed informant

enabled us to identify klansmen responsible for: the bombing

of two automobiles and a Negro mortuary in New Bern;

North Carolina. This information was turned over to local

authorities. Three defendants were convicted in State court.

Bogalusa Injunction

In Bogalusa, Louisiana, during the height of the

racial disorder in that community in 1965, FBI investigation

led. to the obtaining of an injunction against the Anti-

comnunist Christian Association also known as Original Knights

of the Ku Klux Klan. This was a major deterrent to further

Klan violence in that community.

In August, 1966, a sertes of bombings occurred in MIlwaulee,

Wisconsin. Through a high-level Klan source of our Chicago

Office we learned that Grand Dragon Cheney was responsible

for these bombings. The Department ruled that there was

no prosecutable Federal violation.

However, we pursued an

intelligence-type investigation and furnished local author-

ities in' Milwaukee with complete information coming from

our Chicago Klan informants. Turner Harden Cheney was sub-

sequently convicted and sentenced to 15 years.

The result

has been that. the Klan in Illinois and Wisconsin has not

been able to effectively organize and its expansion in the

Midwest has been halted.

Virginia

In the Fall of 1965 the United Klans of America began

an Intensive organizational effort in the State of Virginia.

Fe immediately began an all-out effort to penetrate the

Virginia Klan, contain its growth, and deter violence.

Working

closely with local and state authorities we were able to

disseminate information on contemplated cross burnings.

Several arrests were made based on FBI Information furnished

to local police and in one situation, a klansman was sentenced

to three years in local court for burning crosses, a felony

under Virginia law. While conducting official investigations,

two Agents of this Bureau were assaulted by klansmen who were

later convicted on charges of Assault of a Federal Officer and

Obstruction of Justice in Federal Court in Richmond, Virginia.

In December, 1966, the Special Agent In Charge of

information regarding Klan activities in his state. As a

result, Governor Godwin pressed for more effective enforcement

of Virginia cross burning laws, and publically repudiated the

the Klan attempted to retaliate and we learned of plans to

Ku Klux Klan Investigations

KLAN INFILTRATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

We are constantly alert for information concerning

klansmen who become members of local and state police

agencies and Klan attempts to infiltrate law enforcement.

Law enforcement agencies have always been a prime target of

the Ku Klux Klan. In 1964, We furnished intormation to

Governor Paul Johnson of Mississippi concerning klansmen who

were members of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. These men

were subsequently fired. Since that time relations have

greatly improved rendering more effective the fair exercise

of local law enforcement responsibilities in Mississippl.

It has been part of our established policy to notify

the head of the law enforcement agency involved of any mem-

ber of his organization who has been sworn into the Ku Klux

Klan. In addition, the Governor of the state is notliled.

ACQUISITION OF YEAPONS AND DYNAMTTE OF THE KU KLUX KLAN

As part of our investigation of Man groups, e

determine the extent to which they are acquiring and stocke

piling weapons, amunition, and dynamite, During our inves

tigations we always.

endeavor to determine the numbers and

types of reapons.and the amount oi dynamite possessed by

klansmen.

In 1964, for example, (James Rubledge of Vertaian.

Mississippi, was arrested by FBI Agents and local auchorities

"for possession of dynamite wich, according to our Klan'

sources, he intended to use for bombing purposes.

If It is determined that illegal weapons such as

automatic machine guns;. Illegal rifles and shotguns, are"

being held by klansmen, appropriate investigations under the

National and/or Federal Firearms Act are instituted.

Ku Klux Klan Investigations

INTERVIENS OF KLANSMEN

One of the greatest attractions for klansmen 1s

the alleged cloak of secrecy which surrounds their Klan

membership.

Te have found that a program of selective inter-

Views of klansmen, where they are made aware of our knowledge

of their Klan affiliation, has done much to cause disillusion-

ment of the members and disription of the organization." In

some instances klansmen volunteer Information about the

organization and its activities. These interviews also put

us in a position to assess eachumember with regard to his

potential as an informant. Although our Agents in conducting

their interviews are frequently-met with hostility and threats

by militant klansmen, our Klan Interview progran has been most

effective in deterring violence and developigg informants.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On December 7, 1967, an Informant of our Mobile

Division learned of Klan plans to burn crosses in Montgomery,

Alabama.

This information tas disseminated to appropriate

local authorities ir an effort to effect arrests during the

commission of these illegal acts.

Only within the last week an informant of our

Jackson Office obtained Information concerning possession

of 105 sticks of dynamite byl. Harner of Jackson,

Counterintellitence Program

A highly specialized and aggressive program of counter-

Intelligénce was initiated in 1956 for the purpose of exposing,

disrupting, discrediting, and otherwise

neutralizing the Communis

Party-USA, and related organizations. Accumulated successes

achieved in our efforts directed against the communists under

this program, coupled with increased activity by the purveyors

of racial hate, warranted the expansion of the program in the

Fall' of 1964 to include Klan- and hate-type organizations and

their memberships. Counterintelligence action today 1s a valu-

•able adjunct to investigative responsibillties and the techniques

used complement our investigations. All information related to

the targeted organizations, their leadership and members, which

1s developed from a variety of sources, is carefully reviewed

for its potential for use under this program.

Examples of recent disrupting and neutralizing results

achieved by this program are the following:

The principal vehicle in which the Communist Party-USA

Is endeavoring to influence and recruit youth is the W. E. B.

DuBois Clubs of America, which was spawned by the Party in

•San Francisco, California, In June, 1964. The DuBois Clubs

projects 1tself as a "broad-based Socialist organization, " while

Its dedicated comnunist leadership deviously operates behind the

scenes in an effort to manipulate and influence the political

climate on the Nation's campuses.

TOR SECRET - OFF. THE RECORD:

Utilizing public information, we have prepared the

text and eye-catching format of a four-page leaflet entitled

"Target.'. American Youth!" which thoroughly documents the

conmunist origin, objectives, and control of this youth organ-

ization. This leaflet has been sponsored by the Catholic War

Veterans and is in the process of being disseminated through-

out the Nation with emphasis placed on its circulation in

areas where the communists have made inroads among students.

EXHIBIT NO. 33 - Leaflet: "Target...

American Youth!"

Through a variety of techniques, we have been able.

to alert the owners of private meeting locations to the use

of their premises by the Communist Party and its Ironts. The

communists rarely use their organizational titles in renting

private halls, auditorlums, picnic grounds, and the Ilke, for

their rallies, propaganda, and fund-raising functions which

they endeavor to project as civic or social in nature. Often

an anonymous letter or directed publicity is sufficient to

alert the management of such locations, and the communists must

necessarily expend time and expense in efforts to find a new

site for their meetings.

Although still in Its formative stages, our program

• directed against hate organizations is beginning to achieve

similar success. For example:

MR. TOLSON:

• The attached analysis of

Communism and the Negro Movement is

highly explosive. It can be regarded as

¡ja personal attack on Martin Lutheryking.

"There 1s no doubt it will have a heavy

impact on the Attorney General and anyone

else to whom we disseminate it.

It is

Labeled OP SaGHEr. However, even such a

high classification seems to be no bar

today to a leak, and should this leak out

it will add fuel to a matter which may

already be in the cards as a political

issue during the forthcoming Presidential

campaign.

The memorandum makes good reading and

His based on information from reliable sources.

We may well be charged, however, with

expressing opinions and conclusions, parti-

cularly with reference to some of the

statements about King.

We must do

our duty. H

nis memorandum may scantle the Attorne

eneral, particularly in view or his pas

association with King, and the fact that we

are disseminating this outside the Department.

Wevertheless, the

memorandum is a powerful warning against

Communist influence in the regro

andive"will be carrying out

movement,

our responsibility

by disseminating it to the people

¡ in/ the attached memorandums out

indicated

I am glad that →

you recognize

at last that there

exists such influence.H

COMMUNISM AND THE

NEGRO MOVEMENT.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED.

MEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 10,1700 BY SPRAINeL

The Attorney General telephoned at'approximately 10:15 a.m.

He advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of

the building. The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Army

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about the

communist activities of Vartin Luther King. The Attorney Genera, was reich ing

to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Current.

Analyses, " dated Cctober 16, 1963. There is no question this is the report:

to which he is referring: although he persisted on calling it the report on the

(communist background of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney General said he would like to know what other

dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose

for such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to ask if the

Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney General that

obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not

concern matters of suificient importance to warrant the Attorney General's personal

attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

in matters of current interest under our Internal Security jurisdiction., and that

dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well

as other top governmental officials because of responsibilities they have in this

connection.

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney

. General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communist

(activities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be

called on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability

•of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.' The Attorney General.

said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's

communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the dissemina

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it.

recommended that

be

advised concerning this matter, This appears inadvisable

since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the

South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J: Haworth, Director,

NSF, should be furnished information regarding communist

influences exerted on the SCIC and King.

In this regard

we recently disseminated to the White House and the

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

summary entitled "Communism and the Negro HovementA

information

regarding the

SCIC and King.

This sunmary

deals with King's communist

connections and his personal immoral activities, With the

undoubtedly he removed ern the war program to obtain qualified

Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation

in the NSF program is being sepazately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies..

JAMES A. WILDEROTTER, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

Memorandum J. C. Farrington to Mr. McDermott dated

6/17/75, captioned as above, attached an inventory of documents

that were received from Mr. Wilderotter at the time of his transfer

• from the Department of Justice to the White House legal staff.

REC-107 15-55557-9167

Upon receipt of the memorandum and the attached inventory,

I discussed with Mr. Adams at 5:05 p.m., 6/20/75, the necessity to

advise Mr. Wilderotter that the inventory was prepared and to discuss

with him the propriety of making this material available to the Department..

Mr. Adams agreed and I called Mr. Wilderotter's Office at the White

House at 5:10 p.m., 6/20. His secretary assured me he would return

my call. Mr. Wilderotter called me at 10:15 a.m., on 6/23. I explained n

to him that Mr. Farrington had completed compiling an inventory of the

gitems Wilderotter furnished Farrington and that among the items on the

inventory I observed several which related to the official and confidential

files that had been maintained in Director Hoover's personal office suite.

FIL

I told Mr. Wilderotter that it was my understanding that the Deputy

Attorney General was interested in discussing the official and confidential

files with the Attorney General prior to discussing the matter with

representatives of the Senate Select Committee. I told him that I thought

it would be necessary for me to advise the Deputy Attorney Generai that

material relevant to that matter may be available in the materials

inventoried by Mr. Farrington for Mr. Wilderotter. Ilisted and described

for Mr. Wilderotter Items 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 36 and 40 on the

inventory as probably being relevant to the material of official and

confidentiat files: Mr. Wilderotter recognized the items from their

description and agreed that the materials should be made known ta the

Deputy Attorney, General. He said that I should dispose of the materials

Re: Inventory of Documents Received From

wait.

in any way I felt was appropriate. He said that he would like to have

an indication from the Bureau as to the materials we had received

from him and some sort of a receipt for the materials. He said he

did not want to be accused later of having removed classified material

trom the Department of Justice. In that regard I told Wilderotter that

we probably could furnish him a copy of the inventory and a receipt

indicating that the items described therein were received from him.

I understand Mr. Wilderotter's concern about possible

allegations that he removed material from the Department and I believe

it would be appropriate for us to prepare some statement indicating the

extent of the materials he did furnish to Mr. Farrington. If we furnish

Wilderotter a copy of the inventory, he will have information classified

top secret and sufficient identifying data as to particular documents to

indicate the identities of individuals which could, if inadvertently

disclosed, result in invasions of personal privacy. Therefore, I suggest

that we may comply with Mr. Wilderotter's request by attaching a copy

of the inventory to a letter addressed to the Attorney General stating that

the materials described were received from Mr. Wilderotter. We could

furnish Mr. Wilderotter a copy of that letter and allow him to review

but not retain a copy of the inventory.

RECOMMENDATION:

1.. That the Deputy Attorney General be advised of the existence

of the materials concerning the materials contained in the official and

confidential files described in the inventory.

Done 3051/3/75.

2. That Mr. Farrington prepare a letter addressed to the

Attorney General, copy to the Deputy, describing the circumstances

under which Wilderotter furnished the material and enclosing a cópy-of- -

the inventory.

MEMORANDUM

Appearance before

ALL INFORVATION CONTAINED

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on

June 4, 1975

DRE 1/25/0 p

I was questioned by Mr. Mark Gittenstein and Miss Mary D'Oreo,

members of this Committee, on June 4, 1975, from 2:30 P.M. to

4:40 P. M. on June 4, 1975.

He started the questioning by asking about the different positions held

by Mr. Tolson in the FBI. He was advised when he came to the Seat of

Government he held the positions of Chief Clerk in the Administrative Division,

Inspector, Assistant Director, Assistant to the Director and Associate

Director.

He asked how many people were in Mr. Tolson's Office at the

time of Mr. Hoover's death. I advised him that Mr. Mark Felt, Mr. William B.

Soyars, Mrs. Mutter, Miss Smith and Miss Tschudy (in the reception room,

and myself In a room next to Mr. Tolson's Office. He requested me to draw

a diagram of the suite of offices showing the entrances thereto, which I did.

He asked me about the file cabinets in these offices and whether there were

any cabinets in Mr. Felt's Office. He asked me whether I took any dictation

from Mr. Felt and I told him Mr. Felt dictated to his secretary, Miss Tschudy.

He then asked me what Expedite Processing meant. I told him this

meant that the more important matters were processed and recorded by the

Files Division than the lesser important mail. In other words, this meant by

processing the more important mail first, this category of mail would have

action taken on it before the lesser important mail was acted on.

He then asked me about the abstracts, and who prepared them. I told

him abstracts were prepared on all correspondence; that when I first went to

the FBl the stenographers would prepare them but that was changed and the

individuals dictating the correspondence would dictate the abstracts. He

commented that he thought the abstracts were a very good system.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if Mr. Tolson would ever get any letters

marked "personal and Confidential" from any of the Agents or Agents in Charge"

and I told him occasionally he did. He wanted to know what happened to them

and I told him as far as I knew they went to the Files Section. He also asked

if Mr. Hoover ever received any and I told him thet any he routed around

for Mr.. Tolson to see were sent back to Mr. Hoover by Mr. Tolson and I

could not say what happened to them after they were sent back.

He asked me if anyopapers were sent to Mr. Tolson by Mr. Hoover

?

marked "OC"' and I told him I never saw any.

Mr. Gittenstein questioned me at great length about the Executives

Conferences, how often they were held, who attended them, and who dictated

the Executive Conference memoranda. I told him they were generally held

about once a week, but sometimes only when there were special matters

to be discussed. I told him they were attended by the Assistants to the

Director and the Assistant Directors or by their alternates and that they

were held in Mr. Tolson's office. I told him the individual who had matters

to be discussed dictated the memorandum, which covered all matters

discussed at the conference. He asked whether Mr. Hoover attended these

conferences and I told him he did not. He asked where these Memoranda

were kept and I told him they were kept in the Files Division. There was

considerable discussion about these memoranda. Mr. Gittensteintold me

this was necessary as there was considerable confusion as to these memoranda

and confidential matters.

Mr. Gittenstein asked me if I made a log of Mr. Tolson's appointments

like the Director's Telephone Room Did. I told him I did not, as Mr. Tolson

did not make any appointments; that Mr. Tolson was extremely busy all the

time and when he had any matters to discuss with anyone, he would either

call them on the intercom system or have me call them to come to his office

to see him.

He asked me about the cabinets in the Director's office and if I knew

what they contained. I told him I did not. He asked me about the index cards

in Miss Gandy's office. I told him I would occasionally ask about personal

friends of Mr. Hoover and Mr. Tolson and whether they were written on a

first name basis.

He asked when Mr. Hoover was out of town did Mr. Tolson take over

his duties. I told him they were generally away at the same time. He asked

me If Mr. Felt took over Mr. Tolson's office at those times and i said he did.

He asked me if Miss Gandy and I were friends and I told him we were

official friends but I did not have any outside contacts with her. He asked me

if Miss Gandy discussed any confidential matters with me and I said she did not.

Mr. Gittenstein asked-me if I saw any boxes at all brought into

Mr. Felt's office after Mr. Tolson died. I told him I did not as I was

extremely busywriting letters-and closing out Mr. Tolson's office and did

not pay any attention to anything else. He wanted to know if Mr. Felt occupied

Mr. Tolson's office and I told him he did not until after I retired on June 12, 1972.

## Page 266

Mr. Gittenstein asked me how many rooms there were in Mr. Hoover's

house and I gave him this information. He asked me if there were any cabinets

in the first and second floors of the house and I told him there were not. He

then asked me about the cabinets in the Recreation Room and what they

contained. I told him there were cabinets containing & drawers and that

these cabinets were used for and contained Mr. Tolson's personal papers

and nothing official. I told him there were two cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's

personal investments that I had occasion to use these files in connection with

his investments and his estate and, in answer to questions from Mr. Gittenstein

and Miss D'Oreo, I told them I did not see any official papers in these cabinets.

Mr. Gittenstein said he understood there were a great number of

boxes in the Recreation Room and he asked me if I knew what they contained

and what happened to them. I asked him if I could get some guidance from

Mr. Mohr on this matter,

as Mr. Mohr accompanied me to the meeting.

Mr. Mohr told me he was there when the appraisers came to appraise the

contents of Mr. Hoover's house in connection with the settlement of his

estate; that he was with the appraisers the entire time they were opening

the boxes, that he saw what each box contained, and that the boxes and their

contents were sent to Sloans for auction sale.

There was considerable discussion as to what Miss Gandy did while

I was there. I again told them I did not go to Mr. Hoover's house until

after I retired and I thought my first day there was June 14, 1972. I told

them I had a month's accumulation of work and was extremely busy; that

I worked at a desk with my back toward Miss Gandy; that I knew she was

working on some papers on the table where she was sitting but I did not

know what they consisted of and I did not ask her as I did not consider it

any of my business. My function was strictly to take care of Mr. Tolson's

personal matters. Miss D'Oreo did considerable discussion about this

matter. She asked me if Miss Gandy was destroying any papers. I said

she was putting some papers on her table into a cardboard box.

She asked

me where the papers came from and I said I did not know as Miss Gandy

was there before I arrived and she had her work on the table at that time.

She wanted to know whether the papers were in manila folders and whether

the folders were marked as to their contents. I told her I thought there was

some typing on the tab of the folders but I did not know or read any of the

typing.

She asked me if from my knowledge of regular Bureau files whether

any of her papers consisted of official Bureau files. I told her I saw no

official files whatsoever. She asked me if I ever saw Miss Gandy go into the

two file cabinets containing Mr. Hoover's personal papers. As I could

see these files from my desk I told her I could definitely say I never saw her

go into these files. I again stressed the fact that I had never been to Mr. Hoover's

house until June 14, 1972 and I only went there once a week and that 1 only

saw Miss Gandy about three or four times after I first went there. Miss D'Oreo

again asked me if there were any official papers in the cabinets containing

Mr. Hoover's personal investments and I told her that in my references to

aw 55these files sig not see any official papers.

## Page 267

Mr. Gittenstein asked if I discussed the closing of Mr. Tolson's

office after his death with Mr. Mohr and I told him I did not as I took

care of this matter myself. He asked me what the cabinets in Mr. Tolson's

office contained and whether he kept any official papers or any manifolds

in his office. I told him Mr. Tolson had no cabinets in his office and that

he kept no official papers or manifolds there. I told him the cabinets

were in my office. He asked me what the cabinets in my office contained

and I told him. I advised him they contained tickler copies of letters

which I had written but which I destroyed ascopies of the same were in

the FBI files and the rest of the material consisted of copies of his income

tax returns, his stock investments and his oil investments, all of which

I packaged and sent to Mr. Tolson at Mr. Hoover's house. He asked me

if I took them or who did take them and I told him it was someone from

the Supply Section. He asked me when these boxes of Mr. Tolson's

personal matters were sent to Mr. Hoover's house and I told him just

before June 12, 1975, when I retired.

He asked me whether there was a garage on the premises and

I told him there was. He asked whether there were any file cabinets

in the garage. I told him I had never been in the garage and assumed

there were only implements stored there.

Miss D'Oreo asked whether there were any cabinets in the

attic. I told her I had not been in the attick; that I only went up a

few steps to the attick to ask James E. Crawford, one of Mr. Tolson's

employees, a question but did not go all the way up to the attic.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any

type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-

ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to

avoid needless repetition of previous instructions.

(B) UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SECTION -- A reduction in the number of

Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it

necessary that the time of the remainder be utilized most efficiently to

permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies. It is de-

sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by

Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and

will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to

a high-ranking official of another agency, if its sensitivity requires

suecial handling, ui if its contont roquires come explanation or comment

In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv-

ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda to other Govern-

ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not

of the Liaison Section,

Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether

such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by

regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred

to as form routing slips, contain blocks to be checked which will inform

the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other

agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the

case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-

nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-

times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether

further material may be expected, resulting in later inquiry from the ad-

dressee. It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

If a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally

to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-

head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral

dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking

"please handle"' or "please pass information to --."

Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four

agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai-

son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re-

quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con-

tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda

discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider-

ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison

representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts

concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.

Matters involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-

ated, wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset. .

the other men do, the approved agencies,

These liaison contacts with whom we would be doing

business by phone must be developed and maintained by personal

contact and because of the substantial turnover in agencies,

new contacts must be constantly developed on a personal basis.

These remaining liaison men will also have to act as alternates

Cooperation matters, and coordination of the Bureau's defense

foreign informants and contacts, and the border coverage program.

I believe strongly that this is the barest mininum

number with which the Section can operate under the revised

program because even as projected, the Number One Man and the

Section Chief will be engaged in active liaison outside the

DISCONTINUANCE OF LIAISON FUNCTIONS

MOR -16°

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I have carefully looked into dis -

continuance of liaison functions and resultant release of Agent Supervisory personnel

for reassignment. I have reviewed the Director's instructions (pertinent memoranda

attached) and have conferred with various Bureau officials.

The Director instructed liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President

and National Security Council. Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies

* " being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison

with State, Air Force, Army, Navy, Secret Service, Internal Revenue and Civil

Service. DID feels that some disadvantage or possible criticism could result from

discontinuance of liaison with these key agencies.

At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously

we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and

take such steps as are necessary to solve them

We can always modify nur

procedures when it is in the Bureau's interests to do so. Furthermore, there appear

to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be

handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con-

firmation in writing if necessary. Emergency or unusually delicate situations can

be handled by direct contact.

For above reasons, we should immediately ascontinue liaison service

with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council.

'Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular courier service will provide

expedite transmission. An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can

be handled by phone with confirmation by letter. DID can prepare necessary in -

structions and guidelines to implement our new procedures. Nine Agent Supervisors;-

including a Section Chief, will be made available for other assignments.

Mr. Sullivan' also proposed one of Agents released from liaison be

designated permanent night supervisor on midnight to 8:00 Al silitialDin which

is presently filled on rotation basis.

Sullivan points out additional correspondence

anticipated because of reduction in liaison, making it more amicult for various units

to spare men for midnight shift on rotation basis. There may be an increase but it

is impossible now to determine exact extent. DID should defer this request for 90

days to determis document

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Discontinuance of Liaison Functions:

. Sullivan pointed out In his memorandum (attached) that there are

5 vacancies in DID (none at Section Chief or l Man level - - SA R. L. Shackelford •

was promoted to Chiet of Internal Security Section trom Unit Chief level).*

• Vacancies

are as follows: (1) Three in New Left Groups Unit, one caused by the promotion of

SA Shackelford replacement requested but not yet approved - and two based on

request for additional personnel to handle sharply increased work load involving

violence oriented groups. Two from Inspection Staff have been ordered under

transfer in. Transfers being held in abeyance. (2) One vacancy in Racial, Intelligence

Section based on request for additional supervisor to handle increased work load re

black militant groups -- approved and Agent under transfer in from Los Angeles.

(3) One vacancy in Subversive Individuals Unit caused by transfer of SA S. S.

Czarnecki to the Inspection Staff. Replacement approved but transfer in not yet.

ordered.

In addition, there are 4 immediate vacancies in other Divisions at Seat of

Government: two in Special Investigative Division and one in Crime Records

Division (Inspection Division memoranda recommending replacements attached).

In addition, there is Section Chief vacancy in Administrative Division.

OBSERVATIONS:

Remaining functions will be liaison with White House, Vice President and

** National Security Council plus supervision of Legal Attache Offices and related

I matters. These duties are now being handled by three Agent Supervisors. This is

i not enough to justify continuance of Section; however, a new unit could be established

for administrative control consisting of Unit Chief and three Agent Supervisors. Unit

Chief would administer unit and also be responsible for irregular contacts with key

agencies to maintain effective relations and to resolve and avert incipient problems.

These matters have been discussed with Mr. Sullivan. While he does not

agree with extent of proposed cutbacks, feeling we should maintain liaison with

certain key agencies as set out in his previous proposals, he advises DID will

vigorously strive to effectively implement the new procedures.

It these proposals are approved, a total of nine Agent supervisors will be '

removed from liaison, thus reducing approved DID Agent complement from 124 to 115.

Nine Agents being released from liaison assignment can be assigned as follows."

for existing vacancies in DID; 2 transferred to existing vacancies in Special

Investigative Division; SA Bernard C. Rachner has been transferred to field; and

Section Chief Brennan to Administrative Division at no change in grade or salary.

to replace Section Chief C. Q. Smith, who is retiring effective 7/31/70 (this has

been coordinated with Mr. Mohr and Mr. Callahan).

Re: Discontinuance of Liaison Functions

It is felt the vacancy in the Crime Records Division can best be filled

experience in Crime Records Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

2. That the

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, we are

discontinuing liaison contacts with all agencies except the

White House,

e, the Office of the Vice President, and the

National Security Council. As a large volume of our work

with other agencies has been handled by the Liaison Super-

• visors, we are recommending that those agencies be told that

our increased work and limited manpower require the use of

Liaison Agents in other areas and it will be necessary

for them to utilize other means for the transaction of their

business with the Bureau.

We propose to advise the agencies that any requests

for information. from Bureau

1 files be referred to the Name Check

section by telephone or mail and that requests dealing with

matters of Bureau policy be addressed to the Director in

writing.

Telophonic inquiriss in situations where time viil

not permit a written request and which involve Bureau policy

or current operations will be referred to the office of the .

interested Assistant Director.

Address

cards have been prepared and circulated to

all Bureau officials and stenographers covering those agencies

to whom any volume of Bureau mail has been addressed in the

past. It is not considered that address cards will be neces-

saxy for the small agencies with whom we have had infrequent

contact as a proper mailing address can be secured either by

telephone or from the Government Organization Manual.

We are carefully watching developments in the dis-

continuance of direct liaison and will make prompt recommen-

dations concerning any problems which may be anticipated or

carise.

I would appreciate your observations and recom-

mendation on the following suggestion:

For

many years, FBIHQ had a Liaison Section

which maintained official liaison with the head-

quarters of other governmental departments and

agencies in Washington, D. C.

The discontinuance

of that Liaison Section resulted in an attempt by

the Washington Field Office to handle many inquiries

of high-level officials of those departments and

agencies. It should be noted, of course, that this

office of necessity maintains

liaison on a relatively

low level with all governmental departments and

agencies to insure the prompt referral of cases and

to handle matters pertaining to the effective

operation of this office in the District of Columbia.

I feel that a reinstitution of the Liaison Section

in FBIHQ would place the high level fiaison with

other agencies at the headquarters level where it

would obviously be more effective:

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREINIS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE: 9/24/00 BYSnaGeMen

You requested my observations and recommendations with regard

to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section,

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time

necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled

by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various

levels at the Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies.

When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented

a waste of manpower. 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged

in handling domestic liaison with some 8i different agencies, many of which

obviously were of minor importance to our operations. Since that time necessary

liaison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Ofice as you indicated as

by supervisors and officials in FBIHQ. Washington Field Office's liaison with

other agencies relates almost entirely to the handling of leads and the Bureau's

routine business with those agencies.

I believe we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business

with the other major Federal agencies if we re established a Liaison Unit of limited

size to handle only those agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic.

¿ I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of the existing Special Coordination

Unit (L. F. Schwartz);

WW

SA Robert H. Haynes is currently in that Unit handling liaison with the

White House, the Vice President, and the National Security, Coungil! To his

assignments we shoüld add Secret Service:

Memo for Mr. Kinley

Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C. Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Treasury Department and related agencies with exception of

Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

• U. S. Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures

Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

National Security Agency

Atomic Energy Commission

U. S. Postal Service

Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling

the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle

the greater volume of our business slating to other agencies. This Unit could be

effectively supervised by its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under

A. J. Decker, Jr., Chief and G. A. Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities

Intelligence Section. Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kind of

supervisin and administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison

matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section, Two other

supervisors in the Unit (R. A. Bermingham and H, C. Flemister, Jr.) would

continue to handle foreign liaison, to which they are presently assigned, including

the supervision of Legat operations.

A third Agent would need to be added for

supervision of foreign liaison to replace Rachner, who is now engaged in these

duties. can danced

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organizea

along the lines indicated above with Unit Chief Schwartz; 5 Agents handling domestic

liaison, and three Agents to handle foreign liaison. If approved, this would require

the assignment of three additional Agents to this Unit,

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

SUBJECT: LIAISON SECTION

MOR 16

This memorandum is in response todir, Gray's

comments concerning your memorandum to Mr. Kinley 6/30/72.

Mr. Gray asked for a review of current and past liaison

procedures.

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives

was

not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison

Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility

continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in

the same manner as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.

This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of

the Bureau's domestic liaison pnerations.

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through

the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U.S.

agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those

agencies

was accomplished promptly, eftectively, economically,

and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems.

By the establishment of effective liaison contacts, we sought

to recognize and solve minor problems before they became

major problems requiring protracted and/expensive regotiations

between the Bureau and other agencies.

=

Procedures under Liaison Section

The objectives cited above were achieved by Placing

seasoned Bureau representatives of broad expertence in contact

with officials at the highest lovels of other agencies vhere

the Bureau either

needed help or hat concurrent interests,

In the former Liaison section, ten Agents maintained linison

with approximately 81

U.S. agencies including major intelli

gence agencies,

the military, other major departments, bureaus

and commissions and many lessèr agencies.

They frequently

visated the major agencies, developed a broaa knowledge of

their operations and established a close personal rapport with

high-level officials in those agencies. For example, in matters

of major importance the liaison Agent could make immediate

personal contact with Cabinet officers, directors of bureaus and

many other officials of the highest level.

When our investiga-

tions required interviews of persons of this caliber, the inter

views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the

interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a

minimum of inconvenience to the official involved..

Many of these

high-level contacts were the result of years of development by

the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we were able

to obtain assistance which might otherwise have been difficult

or impossible to obtain. Some examples of this type of support

are the following:

National Security Agency-One of the Bureau's

secure telephone systems was provided and

installed by this Agency at no cost to the

Bureau,

a savings of approximately $150,000.

Through'high-level contacts in this Agency,

we have also been able to secure the results

of its technical research which might have

been difficult or expensive to obtain through

other sources.

Post Office-Our close association with the

Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials

has resulted in that agency providing support

in some of our most delicate intelligence

operations looking to the identification of

illegal hostile intelligence activities in

this

country.

State Department-In addition to providing

at no cost to the Bureau another secure

Department, our high-level contacts in this

Department have.on many occasions assisted in

?:i!

"the speedy resolution of complicated investigative...

problems both in the criminal and security fields.

An excellent example would be the support provided

by the Passport Office of

the State Department in

identifying James Earl Ray as the assassin of

Martin Luther King:

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt

Re: LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence

agencies have consistently provided excellent

support to the Bureau in both the security and .

criminal fields.

Much of this is due to the

high-level liaison contacts developed over the

years with these agencies.

In the Yablonsky

murder case, the military provided, on very

short notice at no cost to the Bureau, an

expert diving team which was able to locate

one of the weapons involved which was an

essential piece of evidence in this crime.

Likewise, the military has been able to provide

a wealth of deceptive information to be used

in our double agent operations directed against

• Soviet-bloc intelligence agencies.

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Through high-level contacts with this Service,

we have been able to arrange with a minimum of

complicated paper work the speedy deportation

of persons entering the United States who are

considered to be threats to the internal security,

such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States

on assassination missions.

In many other instances: through close established

liaison, we were able to avoid the development of situations

in other agencies which could have resulted in operational

problems for the Bureau.

Our liaison, for example, with the

President's Commission on the Causes

and Prevention of

Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance

information concerning possible publications or statements

by those commissions which could have reflected adversely

on the Bureau.

Under these procedures, the Bureau, liaison repres

sentative would be visiting the agencies assigned to him on

a Irequent basis so that officials.of. those agencies would

boro to disches arented policy pobrespondence yat star

the Bureau.

In many of these situations,

Re:

LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while

similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison

Section, are necessarily. less broad and are directed more

towards

facilitating the

resolution of problems raised by

other agencies than producing effective action by other

agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to

the Special Coordination Unit are handling our domestic

One of these is

assigned to liaison with

The White House, the Vice President, and the National Security

Council. He is

backed

up

by the other Agent who also attends

meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the

Unit Chief in handling inquiries from other agencies doing

business with the Bureau.

We have been able in our current system to carry

on an effective liaison operation primarily because of the

quality and number of high-level contacts which had

developed under the previous Liaison Section system.

Although effective, this has really been a holding operation

largely

dependent upon the existing reservoir of well

developèd contacts.

Due to transfers and retirements in

the most important agencies with which we do business, our

established contacts have been deteriorating so that we

are approaching the point of diminishing returns.

to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and

establish new ones.

RE: LIAISON SECTION

Costs

In measuring the cost of a domestic liaison operation,

the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel

involved. Liaison Agents are normally selected from among

Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25, 583-$33,260) ; that is, men

who have the ability and experience required to handle a

Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based

on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison

of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and

the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these

figures, it should be recognized that the Section Chief and

Number One Man in the former Liaison Section, and the Unit

Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only

part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised

the coordination of our offices abroad

and the investigation

of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in

the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us

abroad.

The former Liaison Section also handled other

matters, now absorbed elsewhere, such as emergency planning

and

the

Bureau's participation in the NATO Special Committee.

such as savings in reduced paper work, savings in man hours

of consultation, savings in the elimination o1 unnecessary

or duplicative investigative effort and, of overriding

through the establishment of good will with other agencies.

These savings offset to a considerable degree the increased

salary expenditure.

Conclusion

Although we enjoy a strong operational relationship

with other agencies, including the intelligence agencies,

wherein in many instances we have face-to-face meetings at

the desk level with counterparts in other agencies, we

believe that from the overall standpoint the Bureau

can

profit from the assignment of three additional Liaison Agents

to this work.

We are not recommending that we enter into

lizison functions as broadly as we were engaged in the past

as we believe such an expenditure would not be justified.

What we are recommending is the assignment of one-half the

personnel which had previously been assigned to direct

liaison functions at less

than one-half the previous cost.

ADDENDUM OF W. M. FELT 7-19-72

I recommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the

restricted basis outlined. above. The Liaison Section should maintain

smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-

munity and related departments. We would not change in any way very

effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget

Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in

connection with hijackings and security matters, etc. This action would

eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would

set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that

we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard against

it becoming a mail courier operation.

I recommend the re-establishment of the Liaison Section

and the adding of three additional agents to implement this.

Mr. Gray's approval of the re-establishment of a Ifaison section

included an instruction that the section not supervise offices overseas and in

foreign countries. As this work is so basic to the responsibilities of a

liaison section, I am respectfully presenting several points for Mr. Gray's

consideration in the hope that he will reconsider this prohibition.

The supervision of the foreign offices is handled by three men

who review the correspondence with our Legats resolve their numerous

problems. and handle their many contacts who visit Washington. The latter

also visit other United States agencies while here, requiring coordination which

can best be arranged by a domestic liaison supervisor familiar with the

agency in question. In addition, some of the foreign agencies with which

our Legats are deeply involved maintain representatives in Washington.

These include RCMP, Mi-3, MI-o, and the Australian Security Intelligence

Organization. These foreign representatives regularly visit the Bureau S

to discuss the various requirements which have been made of them by their

headquarters. The foreign liaison supervisors simply do not have the time

to handle these persons in addition to their regular work, and this responsibility,.

which for many years was handled in the front office of the former liaison section,

is now temporarily being handled in the front office of the section to which the

foreign liaison supervisors are attached. The processing of the requests made

by these men and the discussion of their problems with them is a matter of

basic liaison and should logically be handled by whoever will be in charge

of the new liaison section. The courtesy and attention which is given ta:

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. W. M. Felt

Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with

those agencies. In similar fashion the British will not furnish derogatory (S)

information directly to the Department of Defense in connection with its

background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled

through FBl. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison

-. matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same

supervision.

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the

operations of several U. S. agencies and require domestic liaison with those

agencies. Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance

of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is

essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order

to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very

slowly. Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) stations abroad.

JEK ACt 6 11) (B)

They frequently, however, suggest

to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items. These

can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison

supervisor? In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with (S)

local representatives of the U. S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat

which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate

military headquarters.

Liaison, or, in other terms, the establishment of a harmonious

relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.

I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations

closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area.

This has proved

to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that

the re-establishment of limited direct liaison in Washington should be handled

by the same supervision which has been given to our posts abroad. The work in

both areas is primarily intelligence oriented, yet does not fall within the

normal responsibilities of the present operational sections. It is considered

that we should not leave the foreign supervision in its present area, which is

fully occupied with Arab terrorism, Chinese espionage, ard Cuban, Arab,

Chicano and Jewish extremists.. A logical and economical step would be to

make the present foreign liaison supervision an integral part of the new

liaison section. Under this arrangement, the foreign liaison supervision

DATE: 9/8/72

FROM

Daniel M. Armstrong,

II,

SUBJECT LIAISON SECTION

Since I think my recommendations to you may possibly be

the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your

order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this

memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion.

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a

Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section

as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison

Section had operated, according to my understanding.

Specifically, i recummended that the reconstituted Section should

have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and should not

operate out of the Domestic intelligence Division (DID. I suggested that

the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an

appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference meeting.

Supervision of foreign Legats, which supervision had been

included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,

under my proposat, continue to be handled within the DID and thus would

not be handled by the reconstituted Liaison Section.

This recommendation was based on the assumption that the

foreign Legats have seen their responsibilities increased in recent years

to include the collection of political intelligence information for dissemination

., to Dr. Kissinger and others. If they are going to do intelligence work, it

seemed appropriate for them to be supervised by the FBI's intelligence

division,

3/203

You ordered that the new Section not supervise oftices overseas:

and in foreign countries. If this order was in any way based upon my

recommendation to you, my recommendation should not have been accepted

unless you were also prepared to order that the new section would not,

• operate. out of the DID:

Memorandum to Mr. L. Patrick Gray, I

RE: LIAISON SECTION

Your order reestablishing the Section appears to contemplate

that the new Section will operate out of the DID. If this is your intention,

then there is no reason why, in my opinion, the Section should not also be

permitted to supervise foreign Legats. The only reason for my recommen-

dation to you that the new Section not supervise foreign Legats was my

parallel recommendation that the new Section be located elsewhere than

the DID.

In accordance with Mr. Gray's approval, we have prepared

and attached an organization chart of the new Liaison Section.

As he requested, each Agent assigned to domestic liaison has had

previous liaison experience and, with one exception, each was

assigned to the former Liaison Section.

Each of these men is

currently assigned to this Division and no replacements are being

requested.

Each of the domestic liaison men has had at least

twenty years' experience in the FBI, has had wide field, experience,

and is thoroughly seasoned in Bureau policy. /The/ fallowing,are

the

personnel selected:

Section Chiéf - Graham A. Day,

GS-15: I have carefully

evaluated not only the supervisors in this Division but also those

elsewhere in the Bureau who have had experience in liaison opera-

tions and I have concluded that Day is the best qualified for this

position from the standpoint of experience and specialized back-

ground. Headquarters liaison is entirely different from field

operations and requires a thorough knowledge both of the problems

and policies of the domestic and foreign fields and of the opera-

tions of the major agencies here in Washington with which we have

interests in common. Day has had extensive liaison experience,

having served as Number One Man of the forner Liaison Section and

handled top liaison assignments prior thereto. He is cur-

serving as Number One Man in the Nationalities Intelligence

Section, in which Section the present Special Coordination Unit

is located,

and foreign liaison ever since discontinuance of the Liaison sectio

supervision, and the FPC patters.

Schwartz was assigned to the previ-

ous Liaison

Section and has an unusually wide personal acquaintance

with both top and working level personnel in other U. S. agencies as

well as having represented the Bureau on several of the U. S. Intelli-

gence Board Committees.

Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,

he was given a special citation by the U. S. Air force in appreciation

for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service.

Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls from

other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his

relationship with other agencies.

In addition to a highly successful

and productive career at Headquarters, Schwartz directly supervised

in the New York Office the then highly

important investigation of the

New York State Communist Party and its membership prior to his assign-

ment in Washington.

Liaison Supervisor - Robert H.

liaison with the White House, Office of the

Haynes, GS-15: Will handle

Vice President, Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board, National Security Council, and Bureau of

Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

He handled the Bureau's liaison with

the White House, Office of the Vice President, and the National Secu-

rity Council for a number of years in the old Liaison Section and was

continued in this assignment by the former Director after the Liaison

Section was dissolved.

Haynes also has a wide range of contacts in

many other agencies, both military and civilian. He, too, has repre

sented the Bureau on a number of security-type committees. In addi

tion to his experience in the Executive Branch, Haynes was selected

Ior and served with the investigative staff of the House Committee on

Appropriations, discharging his responsibilities in highly commendable

fashion.

Liaison Supervisor - Fred J.- Cassidy, GS-15: Will handle

liaison with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

He was one of the two

Agents who handled the CIA liaison before it was cut off by the former

Director...He.is.currently: serving as SIC of a Soviet espionage unit

-Re: LIAISON SECTION

for a number of years, McDonnell handled our liaison with NSA and

was directly responsible for some of the major contributions NSA

has made to FBI work.

He "is widely known and respected at NSA

and

other agencies with which he has dealt. He is currently SIC of a

unit within the Nationalities Intelligence Section.

He had broad

supervisory experience in New York Office prior to

transfer to FBIHQ, '

serving as supervisor of the major case squad in the Criminal Section,

and

subsequently of the Satellite Section handling Soviet-bloc

espionage matters.

He later became Number One Man to the SAC of

the Espionage Division of the New York Office,

Liaison Supervisor - Bernard E. Rachner, GS-14: Will handle

liaison with State Department,

Treasury (including Secret Service,

Internal Revenue, Customs, and Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms). In

the old Liaison Section, Rachner maintained liaison with state

Department and Secret Service.

He enjoys a first-name relationship

with the Secret Service Director and has an encyclopedic knowledge

of State, including contacts at all levels. He is currently assigned

to the woreign Liaison

Desk where many State Department officials

continue to telephone him to bring up matters of interest to the

Bureau.

Prior to assignment at FBIHQ, he handled some of the most

sensitive and important investigations being conducted by WFO in the

security field.

Liaison Supervisor - John-E.

Manning, GS-14: Will handle

liaison with Defense (including Army,

Air Force, Navy, Marines, DSA,

DIA, OSD, DIS, and Watch Committee).

Of the Agents named here,

Manning is the only man, who did not serve'in the former Liaison section.

Since its dissolution, however, he has worked with SA Schwartz in

handling the numerous

telephone inquiries received from other agencies

and has personally resolved special problems arising with other agen

cies, particularly the military.

An example of his effectiveness

in

area is the very commendable job he has done in developing a

smooth working relationship between the Bureau and

the Special Air

Mission of the Air Force,. Another of his: responsibilities: in.his

It is proposed that the men be designated liaison supervisors without

a unit designation.

It should be observed that the newly constituted section

will not interfere with the specialized liaison currently maintained

other divisions and will not attempt to handle liaison across the

board with all other departments and agencies in the Executive Branch,

but, rather, will concentrate on those agencies having the most mat-

ters of mutual interest with us and with which problems are most apt

to arise.

will be prepared and submitted for approval as soon as the new section

You previously approved the establishment of a Liaison

Section and the purpose of this memorandum therefore is to submit

the names of candidates to fill the position of Chief of this Section.

On 10-11-72 available members of the Personnel Selection

Board met in my office, consisting of myself and Messrs. Walters, Miller,

Bishop, Callahan, Dalbey, Jenkins, Conrad, Baker and Bates. In view of

the pending transfers of SACs Kunkel and McDermott, I did not invite them

to attend the meeting; however, in the future I intend to utilize the services

of nearby SACs.

With the exception of Assistant Director Baker, all members

have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of

preference, SA Graham A. Day, ASAC James J. Dunn, and SA Homer A.

Boynton. Mr. Baker recommended, in his order of preference, SA Boynton,

ASAC Dunn and SA Day.

1. SA Graham A. Day, No. 1 Man, Nationalities Intelligence Section, DID.

He entered on duty 1-4-43, is in Grade GS-15, age 60, married, 2 children.

He reported to DID 11-11-54, served as No., 1 Man of the former Liaison

Section from 3/61 until 7/70 when the section was disbanded and since 5/10/72

has served in his current position. Mr. Day's age, length of service at FBIHQ.

were carefully considered during the meeting; nevertheless, with the exception

of Mr. Baker, the others present, including me, feel that Day is without a

doubt the most qualified employee to fill this particular position. He has had

vast experience in liaison work and even in his current position has continued

to directly supervise both domestic and foreign liaison furctions. He has a

thorough knowledge of the problems and policies of the domestic and foreign

tields and of the operations of the major agencies here in Washington He

.:is without doubt the Bureau's top expert on laison matters andie has many

top-level contacts in Government. It was also pointed out that during the-

critical initial stages of re-establishing our liaison functions it is essential

that the man heading the section be exceptionally strong in. this field and Day

extainly fulfills this requirement.

DATE 12/02 BY SPARALY

Mr. Gray has approved the reconstitution of the Liaison

Section and has appointed SA Homer Boynton of the New York Office

as the Section Chief. In line with this and pursuant to Mr. Gray's

request that Section

personnel be selected who have had previous

Liaison Section experience, I have prepared the attached organi-

zational chart indicating the new personnel and their assignments.

Each of the Domestic Liaison Supervisors, with one exception, was

assigned to the former Liaison Section; each is currently assigned

to this Division and no replacements are being requested;

and each

has had at least twenty years' experience in the FBI with wide

experience both in the field and at FBI Headquarters. My memo-

rendum 9/2717s contained full details concerning those men and

their assignments.

The appointment of SA Boynton has necessitated

some changes and the following is a summary of the anticipated

assignments:

Number One Man - Graham A.

Day, GS-15:

It is essential

that the new Section Chies be given the benefit of the most expe-

rienced assistant available to provide knowledge and background

regarding the problems and policies of both the domestic and for-

eign fields and of the operations of the, major agencies here in

Washington with which the new Section will deal. SA Day was

Number One Man of the former Liaison Section and supervised what

remained of our domestic liaison after its dissolution.

He has

supervised the HILEV Program since its inception and is thoroughty

knowledgeable in all aspects of both our work abroad and our

liaison in Washington.

Memorandum

TO

Mr. W. M. Felt

DATE:

11/0/72

FROM : Mr. E. S. Miller

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

, DATE

SUBJECT LIAISON SECTION

In line with the re-establishment of the Liaison

Section, as approved by Mr. Gray in my memorandum of 10/19/72,

I am recommending that the 10 Supervisors assigned to this Section

be given the title of Inspector with no change in pay for the

duration of their liaison assignment and be authorized to use

personal cards for official business as needed.

The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison

contacts for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis

of their background

and experience to effectively represent the

Bureau at the highest levels of

important foreign and domestic

agencies. All of these men will be meeting fregently with u.s.

and foreign officials of the highest rank, which

will

include

Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and

foreign agencies.

In order to carry out their assignments in the most

effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men

be recognized as

much as possible by the officials they are con-

tacting as key representatives of the FBI.

This procedure has been

tollowed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives

handling our liaison with Congress and the American Bar Association,

both of whom carry the title of Inspector.

This has been found

to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling

their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be

equally helpful to the men of our new Liaison Section who have been

selected to handle our domestic and foreign liaison assignments.

• ACTION.

"if tee

If approved, the Supervisors assigned to the Liaison

Section will

be given the temporary title of Inspector"lor the

duration of their liaison assignment and will be authorized to use

personal cards for official business as needed.,

Memorandum E.S. Miller to W. M. Felt

Re: Liaison Section

ADDENDUM ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

.11/24/72

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with

title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to

Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or

seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau

representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties

requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the

Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.

Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as

much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to qualify them

for the temporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment

and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties

authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

ADDENDUM W. M. FELT

11-27-72:

I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic

Intelligence and Administratiye Divisions as to the conferring of the title

Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section.

However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served

in the long run by taking favorable action. I am convinced that to accede

to this request would result in similar requests from other divisions, many

of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.

In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance

of the Inspector's title in the Bureau.

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from

such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him. Such action would

be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference

Act which specifically states 30 days advance written notice must be furnished

to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank. If we were to

advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only

for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the

law in giving the employee 30 days' advance written notice. Therefore, in

considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not given to the

recommendation.
