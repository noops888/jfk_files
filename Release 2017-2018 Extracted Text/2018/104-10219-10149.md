LITTER DISPRISCTITS

11221a9 Fartin

"He Caradian Press correspondent in oscow, :1111an

Buckley, approacied our Fronesy informally in the disclo of

Decezber on behalf of illian iartin, the ex-employee of Nis

uno defected to the soviet trice in 1560.

ccordirs, to Buckley, artin wishes to see nis parent

or compassionate reusons and wants to allow 1f he iculd i

adaitted to Canada without fear of extradition to tbe united

States if he mere to arrange a rencez-vous with lis parents 1n

'ancourare io do not know whether tartin st'li nas & únited

States passport or whether he has becose a soviet citizen. In

any nont tartin consisers tiaself inadrissible to tre United

States.

Suckley not tartin at the aparient of howard kausch,

the Moscor correspondent for Yeirar ill Publications.

In

addition testin later telephored suckley lo indie:to his interest

In finding out wether or not he could cone to Cartil ruckley

assumesg quite rightly I soulf think, that the taner in which

Martin has sado his request indicates that his tussian hosts are

awaro of his interest in petting out of the covi: Union to see

his parents.

ie havo inforod our Embassy that 1t shoula take no

action so enccurage Puckley or tartin to celieve ta: a visa

would 'e granted lf tartin iore to nato forzal application.

Since, however, 'artiris intorest in coming to Canaca is already

in a neuspaperian's banda, we cannot rule out the possibility

that luckley nich: "rite about iartin's irterest. Soch a story

would probably lead to the need for an expression of che Canadian

joverracst's attitude. In =atira reccapercations er the kind of

response that aight i sade in the event that a question is put

to my sinister, li wuld to zost useful to know what vartin's

status in las 1s so far as the linited States is concerned. Il,

for exasple, your foremment could not tiso legal action, the

Canailar autnorities vould to 1: a position ii this aatter came

to publie aliontion to say tiat they were not anare os any barrier

preventing Vartin fros seeing his parents in the United States.

I should be most grateful if trough your channels me could be

provided inferially with an irdication of dartin's status in las

In the snited States•

Buckley's only otter comment on Jartia was that he cidn*t

really loos snat to sake oi tartin. Martin seesed outspoken in

dealing with the shortcorings af life in the Sovirt Bnion. On the

other hand he spoke with a slight stamer ard sec. i DervOus.

Buckley's vies for what it is worth is that Martin 1s not Interested

In getting Into troable with the jussians or doing anything which

they sight consider underhanded. I should enhasize that no verber

of the Canadian Iabassy has bad any direct contact sita Martine
