1. The attachment was passed to us by SMACT/1. SHARET orafers
to make their inquary tarough us in order to hold down the possibility
of g news leak regard:ng William Martin's potential trip to SMADD.
The last thing the SUADDs want is for this item to hit the papers,
SHACT/1 says the forci,2 sinister would prefer that no visit taze
place. Until the laiter learns more definitively from LNNARP authori-
ties whether or not Kartin would be subject to extradition he will
reply to questions - sould the sroposed visit be leaked - that he
has “no information." ‘wWeanwhile he would appreciate receiving LXHARP
opinion as to Martin's current status in law,

LIXTTIR DISPRIZSTING

the Caradian Press Correspondent in itoscow, “11am
Buckley, approacted our ‘xdassy informally in the afcdle of
Decexber on behalf of .illiax Jartin, the ex-employee of NSA
who defected to the Soviet Union in 1560.

\ceordirg to Buckley, wartin wenes to see als parents
for coapassionate reasons and wants to snow tf he wuld ve
adaltted to Canada without fear of extradition to the united
States {f he were to arrange a rencez-vous with tis parents in
Yancourer. “e do not know whether Nartin st! 11 nas a United
States passport or whether he has tecoxe a Soviet citizen. In
any ovent Martin consisers taself inadzissible to tre United
States.

Suckley met Nartin at the apartsent of Howard kausch,
the Moscow correspomient fer MeGraw-lill Puslications. In
addition Martin later telephoned suckley to indicste his iaterest
in finding cut wiether or not he could coue to Canada. cuckley
assumes, quite rightly I would think, that the sanrer in which
Martin has nado his request indicates that his ‘Sussian hosts are
auaro of his interest in yotting out of the Sovist Unton to see
his parents.

we have inferwd our Zabassy that it shoulé take no
action to enccurage Puckley or Martin to cclieve that a visa
would :¢ granted if vartin were to nake forzal application.
Since, however, artin's intorest in coming to Canaca is already
in a newspapersan's hands, we cannot rule out the possivility
that Muckley airht write about Martin's interest. Such a story
would probably lead to the need for an expression of <he Canadian
Sovernmest's attitude. In x2king reconzzencations on the kine ef
response that night ts made in the evert that a question is put
to ay rinister, it wculd be aost useful to know what Martin's
status in law is so far as the lnited States is concerned. If,
for exatple, your Jovernrent could rot take legal action, the
Canalan autnorities would ce i: a position if this aatter came
to public attention to say tiat they were not aware of any barrier
preventing Martin froa seeing his parents in the United States.
I should oe zost grateful if trrough your channels we could be
provided infcrnally with an irdication of Martin's status in law
in the United States.

Buckley's only other comuent on Jartin yas that he dien’t
really know what to make of Martin, Martin seessd outspoken in
dealing with the shortcomings of life in the Soviet Union. On the
other hand he spoke with a slight stamser and sec..i nervous.
Buckley's view for what it is worth is that Nartin is not interested
in getting into trouble with the imssians or doing anything which
they might consider underhanded. JI should emphasize that no xeaber
of the Canadian Sabassy has had any direct contact with Narting
