ASSASSINATION OF
JOHN F, KENNEDY
NOVEMBER 22,1963
DALLAS, TEXAS ;

By letter dated October 20, 1978, the United States
Secret Service, Miami, Florida, furnished to thé Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), Miami, a copy of a letter sent to
that agency by ‘the United States Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion (DEA), Miami, Florida, dated October 13, 1978. The DEA
letter advised that an informant for DEA had indicated that
he was acquainted with Frank Sturgis of Watergate Notoriety,
and during a-conversation Sturgis told the informant that he
had killed President John F. Kennedy. This remark was supposed
to have been made in the presence of an individual by the
name of Bill Johnson. DEA advised that this. informant: could
be made available for interview. -

On Movember 7; 1978, Peter F. Gruden, Inspector in

. Charge, DEA, Miami, Florida, advised that the, informant in
this matter was Thomas Joseph Holt. Gruden stated that Holt
was of questionable reliability, irrational, unpredictable,
and described him further as a murderer and perjurer. He
advised that the only reason Holt was an informant for DEA
at this time was that Holt had furnished information of internal
nature. Gruden advised that David R. Wiser, Inspector, DEA,
Miami, could furnish more details concerning Holt.

On November 8, 1978, David R. Wiser advised that
Holt had come to DEA and had made allegations of wrongdoings
against a DEA Agent. Wiser advised that to date the internal
investigation in this DEA matter has. not uncovered any evidence
to indicate any truth to the allegations of Holt. He advised
that the evidence to date. indicates to the contrary.
Wiser advised that Holt.had stated that during the late
summer 1978, he (Holt) was on Biscayne Boulevard in the downtown
Miami area, when he came upon Frank Sturgis, who was accompanied
by one Bill Johnson. Wiser advised that Holt stated that during .

this encounter, Sturgis stated that he had killed John F.
Kennedy. Wiser stated that he asked Holt “Why would Sturgis
impart this interesting bit of news to Holt who was a

known government witness and publicized DEA informant from
the past?" And Holt replied that it was " one hit man to
another”. Wiser advised. that Molt had indicated an intention
to go to the news media regarding his allegations against the
DEA. Wiser further stated that he thought it likely that
Yiolt would also make mention of the Sturgis comment, in that
he had reported this to DEA, and that they had done nothing
‘about it. Wieer advised for this very reason he wrote a meno
concerning what Holt had reported, and for this reason it was
furnished to the Secret Service.

Wiser made available a copy of this memo dated
October 4, 1978, which is attached.

Wiser further stated that.in a case in which Holt was
a witness for the prosecution Holt had allegedly called a
defendant during a2 trial and told him he was going to “get hin".
Fhe defendant in this matter, at the time of the call, had a
recording of his telephone call made which was played for the
presiding judge. Holt denied making the call to the defendant,
and the judge ruled that Hoit’s testimony could not be pernit~
ted

On November 9, 1978, Wiser had advised that Bil]
Johnson was William J. Johson, date of birth March 11, 1931,
PBI number 133677c, last known address 1890 N.E, 118th Road,
Miami, Plorida.. .

Allegation by Thomas HOLT regarding the Assassination of President Kennedy

&

1. On October 3, 1978, Inspector Donald Clements and I were interviewing
Thomas HOLT regarding an integrity matter, During a rambling discourse i
on his belief that the drug traffic is a mammoth conspiracy headed by
DEA, HOLT mentioned that he was acquainted with Frank STURGIS of Watergate
. notoriety. HOLT stated that STURGIS once told him (in the presence of
one Bill JOHNSON) that he (STURGIS) had killed President John F. Kennedy.
When asked why STURGIS would impart this interesting bit of news toa
known government witness, HOLT replied that it was said by "one hit
‘man to another." 5

2, STURGIS’ alleged involvement in the late President's assassination
has been widely reported by the news media. HOLT had previously stated
his intention to go to the news media regarding his allegations against
DEA. Therefore, he is likely to mention the STURGIS allegation as
well. Assuming that he would also tell them that he had reported the
allegation to two DEA Inspectors, I feel this memo is necessary.

3. Should another government agency wish to pursue HOLT'’s allegation,
he said he was willing to meet with JOHNSON and discuss the matter on
“tape te corroborate STURGIS’ statement.
