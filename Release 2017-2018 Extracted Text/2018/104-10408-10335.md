divorced, was born in France

States from France in

1949 and became a naturalized Anerican

citizen in 1955.

The FBI's interest in Mrs. FERRER was appar-

ently generated by a phone call she made to the Soviet Embassy

in Washington sonetime prior to 29 January 1963, at which time

she requosted inforsation concerning the possibility of Ameri

No conclusions have been reached by the FBI

as

to the naturo or extent of Mrs, FERRER's involvement with

communism or the Soviet Union.

onely avalable, hovever, it appears to this office thros

she is at least a Soviet sympathizer, if not a recruited

agent. On the hasis of several gays and inconsistencies

We note especially the following:

b) The fact that MTS. FERRER's uncle, one

Boris S. DE MERING

and who is associated with an oil company there,

went on

home leave.

While there he was photographed

several times in the copany of CASTRO and

KHRUSIICHEV, and supposedly served as CASTRO'S

interpreter.

LEONOV's principal task in

Mexico City has been the smuggling of arms to

insurgent groups in Latin America, espocially

Cuatenala.
