in veply to your verbal requeet, I forward information
on Luseble ALGUE, and views on his dealings with Lee Harvey

kd ote ACA
Se surmise that the references in GSWALD's 9 Noyember
letter

aconn,y had. since: hoon replaced must refer to Cuban
Conaul Eusebig AZQUC, whe left Mexice fer Cube on permenent

transfer on 18 November 1963, four days before the acsansination.
2OUS had been in Mexico for 18 years and it wag known as enrly
as September 1963 that \cGQUS was te be replaced.>His replacement
dic arrive in September. 4 ..QUE wae scheduled to leave in Ceteber
but did mot leave until 18 November.

we do net know who might have told OS ALD that A QUE
or any cther Cuban had been or waa to be replaced, but we
speculate that Silvia Duran or some Seviet official might have
mentioned it if CS ALD complained about 4200 = ‘e altercation
with him.
