Subject: cable from Chief, sR Division re Possible ia role
Slaying : ; ; oo

“1, The following is the text of a cable from chiar, | ‘SR Division, sent
via’ closed channel from Frankfurt at rena on a 23, November, . for the sttention
of Mr. Angleton: age

"le I desire that you consider ‘ese reactions to the Kennedy
assassination: | :

a. Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio statements
eet as heard in London attributed the assassination to "right-
wing elements." Only as the true identity of the believed
assassin became known did Moscow begin to complain that
U.S. reactionaries were using Oswald as a pawn.

b. Should not ‘the aseigment of 13th Dept. officers to the KGB
residency in the United Nations in New York be considered
in anew light?

c. I discovered from Arthur Martin ((of| during our long
and exceptionally valuable discussions, that one of Harold
Wilson's principal scientific advisors is Captain Ian Maxwell,
who has a long Soviet intelligence background. This may
shed new light on AELADIE's report /I.e., that.Harold Wilson
may be a Soviet agent7. :

2. Putting it baldly, was Oswald, unwittingly or wittingly, part of

this suggests that we can expect major Soviet pressures over the
next several months, for which the Soviets have made careful,

long-range preparations."

2. The above reference to 13th Dept. officers in New York refers to the
presence, reported by an FBI penetration of the KGB locally, in New York or
Washington of one or two known officers of the 13th Department of the ist Chief
Directorate (Foreign Intelligence) of the KGB. This ir cheers is charged with
"liquid affairs," sabotage and assassination. One of the 13th

by the way, met clandestinely with a Soviet "exchange student" from a
Pennsylvania university during the school year 1962-63, which suggests that
the Soviet student is also a 13th Dept. officer or agent. Perhaps _
significantly, bis course of studies was in food chemistry!

os. Bei You will, note that Mr. Murphy's comments come without benefit of
. ‘the ‘traces we pAssed to you earlier today, showing that Oswald _ contact, -

“he Another recently-arrived cable, being sent to the Director- tonight,
‘suguests that Oswald's business with the Soviet Consul was connected with his
own visa.to the USSR and Cuba (in transit) and may, therefore, have been
really rather than ostensibly innocent. : z
