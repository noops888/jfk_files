assigned license plate JL 22-16 which was placed on the above
identified automobile. It was noted that GONZALEZ was two
months late in registering his 1964 automobile as 1963 plates
expired on 1 April 1964, Since the name Armando GONZALES ia a
common Latin American name, the Credit Bureau could not provide

Tepartment, however, supplied ug with information on one Armand
GONZALEZ, Alina Richard GONZALEZ, Anador Gonzalez, Richard G
RAMOS; who was described as having black hair, brown eyes, 5'S",
and Weighing 135 lbs. He was supposedly born in Mexico and his
age ig Unknown, This information consisted of a rather lengthy]
arrest record for drunkedness and arson,

: 2, There were no Headquarters traces on HUGHES, There were,
iz 5 however, numerous traces on Armando GONZALEZ, but we will require
