for him. She ‘said that this Ambassador came to her
house to visit her on the occasion of a party which
she held. She considers him as a friend and she saw
him frequently

"She said that while she was'working in the afore-
mentioned Institute, and before working as a secretary
in the Consulate she went to the Cuban Embassy to help
Teresa PROENZA. The help she rendered there consisted

The Cultural Attache PROENZA never assigned her any
work outside the Embassy, She said that she had

know PROENZA before she had been coordinator for the

(Partido Communista Mexicano, PCM) while it is obvious
that is party does inde exist, although it is dis-
organized. She said that she had not belonged to this
Organization but that she is friendly with its leaders
such as Jose REVUELTAS and the two LIZALDES.

greement with it except for its support of Cuba."

In mid-afternoon, Silvia DURAN informed the Soviet
Embassy that a male American citizen had requested a visa
to transit Cuba on his way to the Soviet Union. She wan-

At 1605 hours (Mexico time) on Friday, 27 September
1963, Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local. employee
of the Cuban Embassy, Consular Section, a receptionist [sic]
speaks with an unknown male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia
DURAN tells the man that the American citizen was there,
the one who wants a visa for Cuba on his way to the Soviet
Union, and he wanss to know with whom he was talking there
because she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet Em-
bassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa,-
then the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him a visa without
further paper work, only advising immigration in Cuba. The
~American, she says, wants to know with whom he had talked
there because he says he was told there would be no problem.
The man in the Soviet Embassy says to wait a moment. A
different Soviet speaks, and Silvia DURAN explains the same
thing to him. This man says to leave a name and telephone
number and says he will call back. Silvia DURAN gives the
telephone number 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate). She also takes
advantage of the conversation and stated she had moved and
wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of hér change of address
so that she can receive the Soviet Embassy's bulletin. The

27 September 1963

Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN received a con-
firmation from the Soviet Embassy that the American had been
to the USSR installation. He had shown them a letter from
the Soviet Consulate in Washington indicating that he had
been long awaiting a visa for himself and his wife to go to
the USSR. No answer had come from Washington; however, the
waiting period was sometimes four or five months. The Ameri-
can also had a letter attesting that he was a member ofa
pro-Cuban organization but he had claimed that the Cubans
would not give him a visa unless he had already received a
Russian visa.

Although the American was still at the Cuban Consulate,
Silvia DURAN repeated that she could not give him a transit
visa unless a Soviet visa was forthcoming, notwithstanding
the American's wish to go to Cuba to wait there for his So-
viet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one in
Cuba and she intended to annotate appropriately the American's
card. The Soviet official echoed her statement that the
American was not known.

At 1626 hours (Mexico time) on Friday, 27 September

Silvia DURAN says he is there now. The Soviet Says the

American ‘showed papers from the Consulate in Washington,
that he wants to go to the Soviet Union and be there for

a long time with his wife, who is Russian, but'the answer
has not come from Washington in respect to this problen,

and according to this procedure it takes four five
months, but without peraission from the Soviet lunion they
should ask, or better said, they cannot issue 4 visa there
without asking Washington. However, according to this man,
he showed a letter indicating he was a member of an organi-
zation in favor of Cuba and that the Cubans said that they
cannot issue a visa without his having a visa for the Soviet
Union, and now he (the Soviet) does not know what to do with
him (the American), because they have to wait for an answer
from Washington.

Silvia DURAN agrees the same problem exists with the
Cubans, that the problem with him (the American) is that he
does not know anyone in Cuba and therefore if that is true
it will be difficult for him to get a visa for Cuba, be-
cause he was thinking of processing his visa (for the Soviet
Union), because he knew it would require waiting a long time
for his visa to the Soviet Union while in Cuba, and from
there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet said the thing is
that if his wife right now were in Washington she would re-
ceive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet
Union, to return to her country, she is going to receive her
visa in Washington but having this visa, she could communicate
to any place this permission, for example here or any place
she could receive it (visa or permission), but right now they
do not have them. Silvia DURAN says certainly and they can-
not give a letter either because they do not know if the visa
will be approved. The Soviet says he cannot give a letter
or recommendation either because he does not know him (the
American) and asks to be excused for bothering her. Silvia
says that's all right and many thanks.

Silvia DURAN was again visited at the Cuban Embassy in
Mexico City by the American seeking a Cuban transit visa.
Mrs. DURAN contacted at least two members of the Soviet Embassy
and facilitated a direct conversation between one of the So-
viets and the American. Conversing in poor Russian, the Am-
erican stated that he already had been to the Soviet Consu-
late and had left an address. The Soviet official replied
that he was aware of that. The American Suggested that he
had not known his address then, and he had gone to the Cuban
Embassy to ask for the address, because they had it. The
American then acceded to the Soviet official's invitation to
come by and give them the address. ;

lieved he had made arrangements in Washington whereby in-
structions would be sent to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico to
issue a Soviet entry visa in a manner which would not require
him personally to visit the Soviet Embassy. ‘rditure of ais

real or imagined instructions to work smoothly.:caused him to

_become rude to the Soviets. Her impression was that he was

simply a "comrade" who could not live confortably under the
rigors of capitalism and wished to return to his spiritual
home in the USSR. If OSWALD talked to anyone else in the
Cuban Embassy, she was unaware of it.

ment attesting to two visits by OSWALD. She could not remem-
ber the exact dateg but said it was the latter part of Sep-
tember. OSWALD showed her a. American passport showing a [
long stay in the USSR. OSWALD said he was a communist and
an admirer of CASTRO. He wanted her help to get a transit
visa to Cuba in order to go to the USSR.- She said she could
only arrange transit through Cuba if he already had a Soviet
visa. The Soviets told her that they had further checking
to do before they could issue a visa. DURAN did not know
why he returned to the United States without a visa. DURAN

told Gobernacion that she had recognized OSWALD on the tele-

vision on -22 November 1963.

of the International Federation of Professional Newspaper
Organization, he was at the offices of the newspaper Excel-
sior on the night of 25 November 1963. There he learned

arrested one Silvia DURAN; that DURAN allegedly had OSWALD
as a guest in her house during his visit to Mexico; that
DURAN placed OSWALD in contact with officials of the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico City. DIAZ Verson went on to claim that

Paperman employed by Excelsior that OSWALD and DURAN on the

day following OSWALD's arrival in Mexico City went to a res-
taurant called the Caballo Blanco or possibly the Caballo

the Mexican police in questioning an employee of the Cuban
Consulate in Mexico City about OSWALD's reported application
for a Cuban transit visa during his visit.

In its note, the Cuban Government had charged that its
Consulate's employee, Senora Silvia DURAN, had been detained
by the police on 23 November, held in prison until midnight,
physically mistreated, and subjected to insinutations about
alleged "intimate relations" with OSWALD. The Cuban note
said that this "illegal" investigation corresponded to the
plan of reactionaries in the United States who were using
President Kennedy's assassination to promote a war policy on
the bases of accusations against Cuba and the Soviet Union.
Alleging that the Mexican police actions had disregarded the
minimum guarantees owed to employees of a consular office,
the Cuban note concluded that the incident had damaged the
friendly relations between the two countries.

Salvador DIAZ Verson was in Mexico city ds he claimed
and did discuss Lee OSWALD with BORRELL and other Cuban
exiles. BORRELL did not tell the story credited to him by
DIAZ Verson concerning the visit to a Mexico City restaurant
by OSWALD and Silvia DURAN. BORRELL had never heard this
story or any similar story before.

BORRELL knew of no meeting between OSWALD and. Cuban
Embassy officials other than the meetings which allegedly
occurred at the time OSWALD visited the Cuban Consulate in
Mexico City. .

The legal Attache in Mexico City informed the Mexico
Station of current problems in the FBI's investigations of
leads pertinent to Lee Harvey OSWALD:

“a. FBI Headquarters sent a cable to Mexico stating
that Salvador DIAZ Verson was the source of the ana-
lysis prepared by Cuban psychologist, Jose I. LASAGA
of Miami.

"b. FBI interviewed DIAZ Verson who said that Silvia
DURAN took Lee OSWALD to Caballo Bayo Restaurant near
Chapultepec Golf Club where they. met Cuban Ambassador
to Mexico, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas. Then HERNANDEZ
took OSWALD for a ride in his car so that they could
talk privately.

"c. DIAZ Verson told the FBI his source was Eduardo
BORRELL Navarro, Mexican newspaperman who writes edi-
torials for Excelsior. .

"d. The FBI sent Matthew CRAWFORD to interview BORRELL
Navarro on 12 January. Latter said he did not know any
more than that OSWALD had been to Mexico and had visited
the Cuban Embassy and Silvia DURAN. He said everything
he knew had been published and was public knowledge.

On 17 January 1964, a source who has furnished reliable

17 January 1964

information in the past advised that he had been unable to
locate a Caballo Blanco Restaurant in Mexico City, but stated
that there is a Caballo Bayo Restaurant located on the out-
skirts of Mexico City. He advised that on 1 ganuary 1964,
he exhibited photographs of former Cuban Consul Eusebio AZCUE
Lopez, who was in charge of the Cuban Consulate at the time
of OSWALD's visit there, of Cuban Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ
Armas, of Silvia DURAN, and of OSWALD to employees of the
Caballo Bayo Restaurant and had conducted extensive interviews
of these employees. The source said he was unable to find
anyone among the employees who could recall any of the persons
whose photographs were exhibited as having been at the restau-
rant.

29 January 1964 :

DIAZ Verson, the source of Jose I. LASAGA's information
that the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico City had a long conference
with Lee OSWALD at a restaurant outside Mexico City, turns out
to be a highly unreliable source, with a reputation for fabri-
Catior. He did go to Mexico, via Guatamala and Nicaragua,
leaving Miami on 18 November 1963. He was to attend a confe-
rence in Mexico of the FIOPP (Federacion Internacional de

—ocsracion internacional de
Organizaciones de Periodistes Professionales) between 19 and

29 November 1963. .
The FBI has questioned DIAZ Verson about his story. He
said that Silvia DURAN, clerk of the Cuban Consulate in Mexico
City, took Lee OSWALD to the Caballo Cayo [sic] Restaurant
near Chapultepec Park where they mat the Cuban Ambassador
Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas and that HERNANDEZ Armas took OSWALD

for a long ride in his car so he could talk. DIAZ Verson said

that his source for this information was Mexican journalist;

Eduardo BORRELL Navarro, editorialist for the large conser-
vative daily Excelsior, but when the FBI asked BORRELL about
it he said that DIAZ Verson had made it all up. BORRELL
said he knew nothing beyond the fact that oswatp had been in
Mexico, had visited the Cuban Embassy and talkda to Silvia
DURAN.

A senior FBI official in Mexico, Clark ANDERSON, told
our Station Chief that he knew DIAZ Verson well wehn they
were both in Havana and that DIAZ Verson was noted for “re-
ports based on his intuitive feelings". He rarely reported

facts.

This seems to discredit completely the story that OSWALD
had had a long conference with the Cuban Ambassador in Mexico
City.

speculation by a rather large group of ratin American

newspapermen in the offices of Exeelsior on the night
of November 25, 1963. —

"DIAZ Verson stated that after Angel FERNANDEZ Varela
was interviewed by the FBI in Miami, he came to DIAZ
Verson and asked: ‘Just what were those:details about
OSWALD meeting DURAN in some cabaret or restaurant in
Mexico City and the introduction of OSWALD to an offi-
cial of the Cuban Embassy?’ FERNANDEZ Varela admitted
he had not understood the story too eet ate perhaps
had confdsed it 'a little' when he retold it.

"On February 29, 1964, upon being further interviewed
concerning variations in his accounts of the above
events, and especially the sources responsible for
certain. specific statements, DIAZ Verson admitted that
he did make statements to a Special Agent of the FBI
on January 4 and 9, 1964, slightly at variance with
each other, and both at variance with what he related
to another Special Agent of the FBI on February 27,
1964. He stated he did not do this out of malice or
bad faith, or with intent to mislead anyone. He de-
clared he did not regard anything he heard, os said he
had heard in Mexico, as evidence, or of serious impor-
tance; he stated he had engaged in loose talk and re-
peated theory and speculation, and when challenged as
to his sources, he was ashamed to admit an irrespon-
sible naming of sources.

"

"DIAZ Verson declined to take a polygraph examination
stating it would only humiliate him further, and show
what he had already admitted.
“With regard to a relationship between BORREL Navarro
and Horacio DURAN Navarro, DIAZ Verson stated BORRELL
Navarro is a Cuban, only temporarily residing in exile
in Mexico City. Horacio DURAN Navarro and his wife,
Silvia, are Mexicans. DIAZ Verson stated that Cuba
protested the arrest and interrogation of Silvia DURAN
by the Mexican Police; the Mexican Foreign Office re-
jected the protest, and in doing so, stated DURAN
Navarro and wife are Mexican citizens. DIAZ Verson
stated this was the account published in Mexico City
newspapers, and he concluded the same matermal name
of Navarro for BORRELL Navarro and DURAN Navarro is only
coincidence.”

The main points covered:

"Elena and Deba are first cousins of three young
Mexicans named DURAN - Ruben, Horacio, and Lynn.
Horacio is the hushand of Silvia DURAN, the Mexi-
can girl who was arrested for questioning about
OSWALD because she had been in touch with him at
the Cuban Embassy when he went there looking for
a visa. [She is or was also a ringleader (no ad-
tional details provided by source) at the Cuban-
Mexican Institute, according to the sourde. ]

"While OSWALD was here last fall the DURAN cousins
invited the GARRO sisters and young Elena PAZ to a
‘twist party' at the home of Ruben DURAN mid-week.
A_few communists they knew (Deba is a communist and
“Elena has been in touch with communists sirice she
was a young girl and went to Republican Spain with
Octavio PAZ.) and a number of peeple who struck
them as very peculiar at the time, were there.
OSWALD was there with two other beatnik looking
boys, one of whom was very tall and all three of
whom they remember quite well. When they began
asking questions about-the Americans, who were
standing together all evening and did not dance

FARRO's were); however, they were intrigued be-
cause their cousin said he did not know who they
were, except that Silvia DURAN had brought them,
and none of the other guests made any attempt to
approach them. When the GARRO's were.so insistent
about meeting them, the DURANS replied that the
boys were leaving town very early the next morning.
The next day, well along in the day, the GARRO sis-
ters and Elenita PAZ saw all three boys together
on Insurgentes. In other words, they had not left
town. At the time they they remarked about it.

"As soon as OSWALD's picture was printed in the news-
papers all three clearly remembered him, and, of
course, the arrest of Silvia DURAN almost immedi-
ately afterward, underlined their certainty. They
were so sickened (Elena and Elemita) that they broke
off their relations with the DURANs; however, their
cousins very nervously looked them up later, Deba de

DURAN boys have made trips to Texas, and that most

being the hushand of Silvia Tirado de DU + She said

"Mrs. PAZ said that on August 23, 1963, she attended
a dinner at the home of a Mexican communist whom she
declined to identify. Among others present at this
dinner were Cuban’ Consul Fusebio AZCUE and his wife.
She had not previously known AZCUE. In conversation
with him during the course of the evening she learned
that he was supposed to return to Cuba on or about
August 27, 1963. She later learned that he did not
depart Mexico at that time.

“According to Mrs. PAZ, she had infrequent contact
with her cousins, the DURANS; however, on a date she
fixed as Saturday, September 28, 1963, she received

a telephone call from Ruben DURAN, who invited her
and her daughter to attend a party at his house during
the first past of the following week. She.was unable
to fix the exact date of this party, but felt it had
been held on Monday, Tuesday, or Nednesday, September
30, October 1, and October 2, 1963, respectively, with
the most likely possibility that it was held on the
evening of October 1 or October 2, 1963.

“It was Mrs. PAZ' recollection that at about 9:00 a.m.
on the date of the party she and her daughter were
picked up and taken to the party by Lidia DURAN. Also
accompanying them was Mrs. PAZ' sister, Deva Garro de
Guerrero GALVAN. She described this sister as a commu-
nist who was expelled from the Party for being a Catho-
lic. :

"At about 10:39 p.m. three young, white Americans arri-
ved at the party. They were greeted by Silvia DURAN
and spoke only to her. They more or less isolated
themselves from the rest of the party and insofar as
she observed they had no conversation with anyone else
at the party.

"The three Americans appeared to be between twenty-two
and twenty-four years of age. One of them was dressed
in a sweater and dark trousers and appeared to be about
five feet nine inches in height. The second one was
about six feet tall, had blond, straight hair, a long
chin, and was a bit 'beatnik' in appearance although
his dress included a coat. The third American wore

no coat.

DURAN.

"1. A usually reliable and senisitive source
reports that on 15 June 1965 an unidentiffied
woman speaking French called Joaquin HERNANDEZ
Armas, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, from Chicago.
The woman stated she was calling on behalf of a
Mr. GAN (phonetic); she asked whether Silvia
DURAN was a friend of Harvey Lee OSWALD, and if
DURAN had returned to Cuba. The Ambassador, who
does not understand much French, said that DURAN
used to work at the Embassy, no longer does, and
that she resides in Mexico, but he does not know
the address. The woman again asked if DURAN was
a friend of OSWALD. The Ambassador, who appeared
not to understand the question fully, Co
affirmatively."

Charles W. THOMAS, Political Officer, US. Embassy,
Mexico City, reports that in the course of a discussion
about’ other matters, Sra. de PAZ mentioned that she had
met Lee Harvey OSWALD. She was very reluctant to discuss
the matter, but finally imparted the following information:

"1, In September 1963, shortly after her return from
abroad, she went to a party at the home of Ruben DURAN,
who is married to her cousin. Her daughter, Elenita,
accompanied her. There she met OSWALD and two other
young Americans who were with him. The three youn;
Americans remained apart from the.other guests. She
expressed.an interest in talking. to them, but was dis-
couraged from doing so.by some of the other guests.

"2. Most of the guests at the party were communists

or philocommunists. She remembers seeing the Cuban
Consul, ASQUE [sic - AZCUE]; General Clark FLORES of
the Mexican Olympic Committee; Silvia DURAN, who she
later learned was OSWALD's mistress while he was here;
Emilio CARBALLIDO, the writer, who she thinks is now |
in the United States; and a Latin American Negro man
with red hair.

"3. In November 1963, when the identity of Kennedy's
assassin-became known, she and her daughter went to

the Cuban Embassy and, once admitted through the front
gate, shouted 'assassin' and other insults at the staff
there.

"4,. Shortly afterward, she and her.daughter were visited
by a friend, Manuel CARVILLO, who was then an official
in the Secretariat of Gobernacion, and were told he had
orders to escort them to a smalf and obscure hotel in

the center of town. They were kept there for eight days
under pretext that they were in danger.

When she told CARVILLO she wanted to go to the Ameri-
cati Embassy and explain what she knew of OSWALD's co-
nnections here with Mexican communists and Cubans,
she was told that the American Embassy was full of

cr unist spies. She said CARVILLO tries to give the
impression that he is an extreme rightist. He now
has a job with Bellas Artes.

"S. Some of the other people who were at the party
with OSWALD were taken to the state of Veracruz,
where they were 'protected' by Governor UOPFZ Arias.
Ruben DURAN is reportedly ‘protect’ by General Clark
FLORFS and is now driving a big car and looking very
prosperous. :
"6, Many communists and philocommunists here believe
Kennedy's assassination was the result of a communist
plot engineered by Fidel CASTRO. Ruben DURAN has sub-
sequently told her that he is not really a communist
and that it had been a great mistake to kill Kennedy.”

During a meeting with his agent handler, LIRING/3
stated that "he was doing his best to keep active cer-
contacts he had had in the past that were on the periphery
of the official Cuban circle. He mentioned specifically
the case of Silvia and Horacio DURAN... He’ related that
Silvia DURAN worked as a receptionist at the Consulate in
1963-1964 and was on duty when Lee Harvey OSWALD applied
“for a visa. She had been recommended to the Cubans by Teresa
PROENZA, the Press Attache from 1959 until 1962. LIRING/3
described Teresa PROENZA as a Cuban woman aged about 52, a
Lesbian, and a member of the Communist Party of Cuba, who
was currently in jail in Cuba as the result of a conviction
for espionage on behalf of CIA. LIRING/3 recalled that dur-
ing his last visit to Havana, a friend of his in the Minis-
try of Education, informed him of Teresa PROENZA's present
situation and advised LIRING/3, in the event he was asked,
he deny that he had known Teresa PROENZA or had had anything
to do with her. LIRING/3 continued that just the other day
Silvia DURAN had telephoned him to say hello and that he had
visited her at her home to renew his acquaintance.

[LIFEAT SAN-26 (10.8) reveals that at about 1245

he obtained her number. He replies: "At the

dying at some school and at the moment is free
to talk to LIRING/3. The latter replies jthat
he would go by to visit her (Constituyentes143,
apt. 3) in a few minutes.]

LIRING/3 continued that Silvia DURAN informed him that
she had first met OSWALD when he applied for a’visa and had
gone out with him several times since she liked him from the
start. She admitted that she had sexual relations with him
but insisted that she had no idea of his plans. When the
news.of the assassination broke she stated that she was im-
mediately taken into custody by the Mexican police and in-
terrogated thoroughly and beaten until she admitted that she
had had an affair with OSWALD. She added that ever since
then she has cut off all contact with the Cubans, particu-
larly, since her husband Horacio who was badly shaken by the
whole affair, went into a rage and has forbidden her to see
them. She added that she felt certain that her telephone
was tapped by the Mexican police, or, more probably by CIA,
since tapping was an expensive proposition and the Mexicans
wouldn't be able to afford it for so long a period.

ROWTON (P), LIRING/3's agent handler, counseled LIRING/3
against further contact with the DURAN's on the ground that it
might put him under some sort of suspicion whether in the eyes
of the Mexican police or the Cubans. He pointed out that lit-
tle -r nothing was to be gained from such a contact."
