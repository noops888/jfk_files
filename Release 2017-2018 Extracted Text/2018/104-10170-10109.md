referred to CIA by the 7 °

c. On 19 March 1976, IPS wrote to
and- enclosed sanitized versions of four documents,
three of which were PDO documents, Deletions had
Been made under (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(6) of the
FOTA. Two additional DDO documents (those referred
by the FBI) were denied in toto under the same
exemptions, The exemptions were explained, the
denying officials were identified by name, and ©
was advised of her right to appeal,
was also advised that FBI and “INS ori-
ginated material was being referred to the FBI and
INS for their direct response to her request.

B. When IPS Listed the four documents they =
erigicously listed the Deputy Director of Security
as denying cocument 1, and Chief, Services Staff
as responsible for documents 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

In fact, the Deputy Director of Security was the
denying official of document 4 and Chief ervices
Staff for documents 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. OGC should

2." (U). Background:

a. Subject submitted a request under FOIA, on
22 March 1976, for any and all information the Agency
held on "A Quaker Action Group" also known as "AQAG."
In the .20 July 1976 initial response, -24 newspaper
“Clippings and.onefeaflet were released to him; two
documents were denied. .

b.- On 23 August 1976 Subject appealed, requesting
that further. information be released to him on the group,

. iDuring the appeals review 11 additional. documents
were ‘lotated-and are included in-the recommendations
below. These documents were not considered during the initial
teview since they were not considered to meet the criteria
for "records" extant at that time and they contained only
incidental references to the subject of the request.

d, During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Air Force documents concerning the subject
of this request. The requester should be told that this
was apparently an error.

ec. During the appeals review we were unablo to
identify any Yepartment of State documents concerning
“A Quaker Action Group. Two State documents tocated, and
possibly referred to in the initial response, do not
concern A Quaker Action Group. The requestor should be
informed that this was also apparently an error.

|
|

3. (C) Recommendations:

Ja, “My specific recommendations are shown on the
Appeals Review Form attached to each document. A
classification review has been conducted and all documents
are considered properly classified and marked in accordance
with E,Q, 11652, as amended,

b.. T recommend that ‘the two documents denied in toto
under the initia! review continue to be denied. One of
them (Tab 3) could identify a still active and sensitive
source, The other (Tab 4) was obtained through a sensitive
operation conducted jointly by. American and German
authorities.
