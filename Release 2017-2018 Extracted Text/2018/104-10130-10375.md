FAVORABLE FACTORS?) i

PROFESSIONAL

These's nothing outstanding about Tarasoff - just an average joe trying to make
a living and without the ambition, energy, perspicdity to make use of a saleable
articles knowledge of Russian, Physically he's sort of soft, tends to be over-
weight - he's about 5'8"tall, and about 190 in weight. His personality is on
the negative side, his manner dull.

Tarasoff was. greatly interested in the possibility of working for the US Govern-
ment. He wants that security. And he has about reached the end of the line
salary wise as a maintenance man or building superintendent. Tarasoff is will-
ing to work in D.C. -but insists on a GS 7 because he has to support a wife and
two children, He does not mind the sedentary aspects of Project Detail = I
doubt if he'd be interested in anything that wasn't sedentary, He also likel the
the other aspects of fstail and I would from taliing with him that he
would be quite able to handle a job on ail, He can translate - reads with

& great deal of ease. His PHS I notive indicated he's interested only in o/s =
this is not what he told mes he is interested in US also but he will go o/s if
necessary. -

I recomend Terasoff for a G5 7 on Project Detail.
