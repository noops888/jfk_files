These's nothing outstanding about Tarasoff - just an average joe trying to make

a living and without the ambition, energy, perspicalty to make use of a saleable

articles knowledge of Russian. Physically he's sort of soft, tends to be over-

weight - he'g about 5'8"tall, and about 190 in weight. His personality i8 or.

the negative side, his manner dull.

Tarasoff was greatly interested in the possibility of working for the US Govern

ment. He wants that security. And he has about reached the and of the line

salary wise as a maintenance man or building superintendent.

Tarasoft is will-

ing to work in D.C. but Insists on a GS 7 because he has to support a wife and

two children. "He does not mind the sedentary aspecte of Project Detail - I

doubt 1f he'd be interested in anything that wasn't sedentary. He also likel the

the other aspects of Detail and I would think from taliding with him that he

would be quite able to handle & job on detail. He can translate - reads with

a great deal of ease. His PHS I notice indicated he's interested only in o/s

this 18 not what he told me he 1s Interested In US also but he will go ofs 18

necessary®
