Termination of LICOOKY-1

‘AETION REQUIRED - REFTRENCES

ACTION REQUIRED: FYY a : ae fj -b ---4

“1, Attached herewith is the LILINK report on the }
terwination of LiCOOKY-1. This report was received fron a F
LILINK on 24 June 1966.

2. Forwarded under separate cover rre two copies of
the Secrecy and Torsingtion agreezent signed by LICOCKY-1,
in true name, on 23 Juno 1963.

3. At the tize of termination, LICOCKY-1 was given (1)
salary for February 1966, (2) eno-way airfare from Hexico
City to New York, and (3) Federal Tax refund amounting to
9,005,00 HN, The household ttens in her possession at the
tine of termination, which belongad to the Station, were :
sold te her for US $300.00.

bbls asetinn

4, It should be noted that although LICNOKY-1 clains
she intends to remain in the United States, she retained ber
apertaent, which was turaed over to a rental agency for sub-
renting. the Station believes that she intends to returs f
within the next several montis or co should it devolep that
she cannot find suitable work in the New York aren. Should :
she do so on her own it may bo that the Station would want it 7
to wske occasional use of her, and for that purpose a post
office box to which she can write to initiate contact was
given her prior to departure.

Chief of Station, Mexico City z

Chief, WH Division
LICOOKY-1 Participation in Mexican Uriters' oa ew
ce

Reference: HMMA 26,621, 15 July 1965

1, LICOOKY-1's efforts as described in reference have
substantial merit and some potential particularly if the Station can
find a way to tie them in with the LIREAM effort in the intellectual
field. q

2. LICOOKY-1 certainly is to be commended for her effort in
getting writers both of the right and left such as Carlos PELLICER
Camara to join the AEM. From a KUBARK standpoint the most iutcrestiag
contact is the one with PELLICER because he has been the reported force
behind the COMES/CLE effort in Mexico.

< 3S. Although her assigned tasks as reported in para 7 a, b and d
ogtke LILINK memo do not entail making her witting of other Btativa
Reacts <ogaged in BHSPAWN Ops among the intellectuals, sp amendecnt
to her OA is required, and one has been requested. If her efforts
progress to the point where she might be able to influence leftist
writers in their efforts to establish the CLE in Mexico (pare 7 ¢ of
LILIXX meso) Headquarters should be forvarded your ideas on why and how
LICGOKY-1 should be used as an active HUSPAWN agent, and another
anucodweat will be required for this role.

4. ANDRIETTE will discuss this opcratiom with the Station during
Bis TDY.

5. Ia view if the restricted OA vhich confines KUDARK's
association with LICOOKY-1, it is important that Hcadyuarters reaain
aware of apy unusual activity im ber personal life which might effect
ker security or the granting of amendaents to her OA for individual
operatione. Therefore, we vould appreciate your kecping us inforned
of a more timely basis of sny undertakings such as the recruiteents
for membership in the AEM described im reference. oe

offering to establish a new series of library prizes iad u

material berefits for its members. . The first mecting of the

AEM was held on 12 August 1954, For some tine the remained,

organized fron tine to tixe, such as the Society of Literary

achieved any effectiveness or respectability. Mexico's establis2..

and well knovn writers have always shunned these organizations.

2, LICOCOKY-1 became interested in the 4

! through her friend:

with Costa~Anic and saw the possibility of building
an organization which would include the middle of the read and
right wing authors who had been systematically boycottedc since
the Lézaro Cardenas’ regime when Narciso Sassols, a neriber of the

Connunist Party, was Minister of Education.

elatively

3. LICCOKY-1 began a one man campaign of recruiti

well known right wing writers who could not be considered mediccre

or nonentities. As LICCCEKY-i's campaign began to succced it be~

case easier to recruit the more importent writers of Mexico cover—

ing the whole political spectrum, In October of 1964, LICCOxY-1



persuaded Carlos Pellicer Cé:ara, well known Nexiecan poct, to

join the AEM. It then becane casier to get other well kn

writers to join. In all LICCCKY-1 reervited nbout 30 of weil
