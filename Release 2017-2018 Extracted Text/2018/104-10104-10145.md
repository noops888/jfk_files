STATE OF VIRGINIA)
)ss.
COUNTY OF FAIRFAX)

veing first duly sworn, depose and say:

1. I was born on 2 Septenber 1928, wes graduated from Laxbuth
College, Jackson, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine,
Nashville, Tennessee, and have been employed by the Centrel Intelligence
Agency since Novenber 1958. I have been in the Psychiatric Staff of

the Office of Medical Services of the Agency since that time.

2. In the sumer of 1971 the Medical Office was approached by
the Director of Security concerning the preparation of a psychiatric
study on Deniel Elisberg, who had been accused of leaking the Pentagon
papers. To the best of my recollection, it was my understanding from
the Director of Medical Services that the DCI wes knowledgeable end had |
approved the Director of Security's visit and the request tliat was being
made of the Medical Office. There was'generel reservation and concern
expressed sbout such an effort involving as it did potentially
controversial and highly spsoulstive efforts. Tt vas felt that such
activity, involving as this did an American citizen, might ve outside of
the Agency's purview. It was recognized that such efforts, while
desirable in some quarters, could ve misunderstood, misinterpreted, and
mistakenly considered to have been derived from the doctor-patient
therapeutic relationship which vas in fact far from the cese. An initial

effort was prepared by Dr. AB under the direction of myself

based upon a review of magazine and newspaper articles conteining
biographical data about Elisberg, as well as some FBI documents consisting

of interview reports by informants about Ellsberg.

CA STA PevEY PROGRAM


3- On 12 August 1971, on instructions from the Director of
Medical Services, the writer met with Mr. David Young, Room 16, Executive
Orfice Building, to discuss the matter of a psychiatric write-yp on the
case of Daniel Ellsberg. Ir. Young, at the tine the appointment vas mede,
had stated that there vas more information which he vished to discuss.
The meeting lasted for approximately an hour and Mr. Young was joined by
a Mr. Linney (probably Liddy), who seemed to be an assistent. kr. Young
stated that the Elisberg study had the highest priority and had been
requested by Mr. Ehrlichnan end Dr. Kissinger. Mr. Young also stated that
the President hed been inforned of this study. He stated that it vas a
multi-faceted approach and the psychiatric report vould be only one facet.
He stated that he understood that the Agency was uneasy about undertelting
such a study and assured me that there hed been no delineation as to hoy

information derived from the study vould. be utilized, and if there were

‘any utilizetion that great care would be given to make it nonattributable

to the Agency. Mr. Young was interested in knowing what kind of data
would be needed in order to provide further study of the sort: done

“on Fidel Castro." Later on Mr. Howard Hunt joined the group. Mr. Hunt
recognized me, being a former Agency employee, and we greeted cordially.
Mr. Hunt amplified on Mr. Young's coménts and stated 1t vas his wish to
“try Dr. Elisbetg in public." Other coments were made by Hr. Hunt or

"Mr. Linney" to the effect that the aim would be to render Dr. Elisberg
ineffective or to neke him the object of pity as a broken men. “Mr. Hunt
stated that he wished to see deta of the sort that "psychiatrists found out
about Barry Goldwater in 1964," and he expressed interest in being able

to refer in 9 lmovledgeable way to Dr. Elisberg's oedipal conflicts or

castration fears and other similar points.
4, It seemed from Mr. Young end. "Mr. Linney" that there was
considerable concern that Dr. Ellsberg had a great deal nore sensitive
information which it was feared he would from time to time periodically
expose, "Ir. Linney" stated that Dr. Ellsberg thought of hinself as

“having the white hat and the President as having the black hat.”



“5. A discussion wes held with the group concerning the dengers of
preparing such a study in isolation and without‘ the opportunity for the
free give and take discussions among experts, as had been the case in our
other studies. I was informed that’ moze biographic material vas available.
Twas requested to give examples of the kind of information needed. I
pointed out thet insofer es possible, “although possibly not availeble,"
data from early life from nurses or close relatives vould be useful. I
agreed with "Nr. Linney" that school progress, including testing, would be
helpful. In the same way, yeer books, his years in college end in the
military, comments from friends vould be helpful. Mr. Runt also stated
‘that it would be‘useful for Dr. Ellsberg's first wife to be interviewed
and he felt, "You con easily arrenge that under an operational alies."

It was pointed out that the first Mrs. Ellsberg would be cooperative.

6. Information was also offered by ifr. Hont or "Mr. Linney" to
‘the effect that Dr. Ellsberg hai beén in analysis although times or
Jocation were not known for certain. "Hr. Linney" pointed out thet after
Dr. Elisberg gave the Pentagon papers avey, he telephoned his analyst
stating, "Now I an ‘free."

7. “Mr. Linney" end Mr. Young, with Mr. Hunt's assent, pointed |
out that the Elisberg study iras of the highest priority, even over the
SALT negotiations. It vas agreed that the further diogrephic information
regarding Dr. Elisberg vould be sent to us and Mr. Hunt agreed to menage
this. Mr. Hunt would also make arrangements whereby periodic conferences
would be held as necessary. Mr. Hunt did, however, offer that he did not
wish to come out to the Agency if he could avoid it. |

8. At this point Mr. Hunt made some comments in the presence of
‘the group based on his previous acquaintanceship with me and he remained
behind and made some further coments expressing a desire that nis
presence and participation in the meeting not be mentioned at the Agency.
After arriving back at the Agency I informed Mr. Hunt by telephone that
it was not feasible for me to avoid reporting Mr. Hunt's presence at the
meeting. ifr, Hunt expressed great regret that this ves necessary,

stating thet he had adequate contact with Generel Cushman end was on good



terms with the Director. te. vas reluctent in agreeing to ny’ statenent
that it vas necessary to inform the Director of Medical Services.

Mr. Hunt wished to know if this could be treated as confidential medical
information, but could not tell the writer in what vay. I discussed the
entire situation-~the dengers and the reservations end the gravity of
the situation with the Deputy Chief, Psychiatric Staff, the Director
and Deputy Director of Medical Services.

9. On 13 August 1971, additional information vas received froa
the White House. fo the best of my knowledge this was from Howard Hunt
end consisted of poorly Xeroxed classified FBI reports end Departnent of
State documents. This material provided additional deta end on
20 August 1971 the Director of Medical Services and the writer met with
‘the Deputy Director for Support concerning the White House request in
the Ellsberg case end the continuing pressure and desire for a psychiatric
study. The problems associated with developing the study and our
continuing reservations were discussed in detail. In view of Mr. Hunt's
enthusiasm, concerns existed about the checks and balances to actions
based on a study if one were to be undertaken. To the best of my recall
the Deputy Director for Support vas in agresmenti vith us. Wnile the |
additional information furnished further’ suggested that Elisberg was
under enotionsl pressure it was not possible to arrive at any fir
conclusions or couprehensive understanding of the man's personality.

The additional infornation indicated that:
. He had revealed quasi-Secret information vhile

still in the service when he wes applying for 9
Pa.D. fellowship.

. He had volunteered for Vietnamese service for the
State Departnent in 1965 while under the stress of
obtaining a divorce from his first wife.

©. He had sought psychoanalytic treatment between the
fall of 1968 and 1970 vith a psychoanalyst (vho was
determined to be professionally qualified and

reputeble) in California.



a. He may have deen involved in leaking information
ebout a South Vietnanese in 1970 while he vas
actually in psychoanolytic treatment.
fo the best of my recollection it wes agreed that the

implications of the ebove data would be orally discussed by ne with
Mr. Hunt, Mr. Liddy end Mr. Young. It was also agreed that there vould
‘be the greatest reluctance to undertake any interview of the former
Mrs. Ellsberg, end it vas hoped that efter this a written document would
not be necessary.

10. ‘Tne Deputy Director for Support considered advising the
DCL, but it vas decided that T vould first visit Mr. Young and inform hin
that the additional material basically provided for no further
understanding. It ves hoped that this would put an end to the situation,
but if further naterial was forvarded the matter would have to be dealt
with at that time.

1. ‘the Deputy Director for Support stated thet efter the meeting
with Mr. Young, the DCT vould’ be brought up to date.

12. Following the meeting on Fridey, 20 August, and in accord
with the discussions on that date, a call wes placed on Nonday, 23 August,
to Mr. David Young at the White House.’ Mr. Young was informed that ve
had received the materiel vhich hed been forvarded and that ve had
considered it, and vould be avaiable to discuss the data further.

Mr. Young stated that he would have Mr. Hunt call me. He stated that
Me. Hunt's office vas elsewhere in the building and he aid not have his
number imuediately aveileble. As of 27 August 1971 Mr. Hunt had not

called me.
13. On 30 Septenber 1971, there is a yellow memorandum of a

telephone cell to me from David Young at the White House with the

message thet Mr. Hunt suggested meeting Wednesday, 27 October, at 11:00 a.n.

On 12 October 1971 I received some more date from Mr. Hunt at the White

House.


Uy. On 27 October 1971, I met with Mr. Hunt and with Mr. Li

and with ir. Young at the Executive Office Building. The essence of
the observations noted above in the 20 fugust 1971 discussions were
orally presented. I vas told to prepare the materiel in writing.

On 3 November 1971 Mr. Liddy sent ne further infornation on BMsberg.

Oa 1 November 1971 lr. Young at the White House telephoned me requesting
the report the following day and he vas informed thet the requested
report was at that time in the hands of my suzervisors for their
evaluation. On 12 November 1971 the material was delivered by me

to the White House and to Mr. Liddy, Mr. Young end Mr. Hunt. These men

were interested in obtaining information which could be used to defane

"or manipulate Elisberg. While it was never expressed, it was my

impression that the material and information provided were not of

irect interest or usefulness to Hunt, Liddy or Young.

MEMORANDUM FOR ‘THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with DD/S and D/NS Regaraing Daniel Ellsberg

1. D/MS and the writer today spoke with the DD/S concerning the
White House request on the Ellsberg case. D/MS made three points
with which the writer is in agreement:

a) The additional information furnished provides further
evidence that Ellsberg was under pressure.. Nontheless, the additional
material provided does not allow for any substantive conclusions or
understanding of this man's personality. He sought psychoanalytic
treatment between the fall of 1968 and 1970 with a qualified and
reputable psychoanalyst in California. The allegation that after leaking
the Rand study that he called the analyst and stated, “now I'm free” would
Suggest that Ellsberg was still involved in dealing with problems which
either brought him to analysis or which were uncovered in the course of
the treatment. In going to vietnam for the State Department in 1965 while
involved in obtaining a divorce from his first wife, he-had sought to
discharge internal tension by taking action; his analytic treatment was
unsuccessful in altering this propensityr, Ellsberg revealed secret
information in the course of applying for a Ph.D. fellowship while still
in the service; he may have been involved in leaking information about a
South Vietnamese in 1970 prior to leaking the Rand study. These actions
may have also been the resultants of internal pressures-—the 1970 incident
while he was actually in analysis.

») There is hesitation about the Psychiatric Staff undertaking
to interview the former Mrs. Ellsberg. It was agreed that there would be
@ great professional reluctance at such a procedure.

¢) There is considerable concern about the use to which the
requested study would be put. In view of Mr. Hunt's enthusiasm, concerns
exist about the checks and balances to actions based on a study if one
were to be undertaken. \

2. ‘he DD/S considered the advisability of discussing the matter at
this point with the DcI. rt was decided that at this point the writes
would again visit Mx. Youxy and inform him orally that the additional
material provided allows for no further understanding other than-as noted
above. It was agreed that the writer would not accept any requirenents
fo undertake to interview the former Mrs. Elisberg. It is hoped that this
will put an end to the situation, but if further material is forwarded,
the matter will have to be dealt with at that time.
