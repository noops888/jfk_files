AFFIDAVIT

I, MA

being first duly sworn, depose and say:

I. I was born on 2 September 1928, was graduated fron Lanouth

College, Jackson, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine,

Nashville, Tennessee, and have been employed by the Central Intelligence

Agency since Novenber 1958. I have been in the Psychiatric Staff of

the Office of Medical Services of the Agency since that time.

2. In the summer of 1971 the Medical Office was approached by

the Director of Security concerning the preparation of a psychiatric

study on Daniel Ellsberg, who had been accused of leaking the Pentagon

papers.

To the best of my recollection, it was my understanding Iron

the Director

of Medical Services

that the DoI was knowledgeable and had

approved the Director of Security's visit and the request that was being

made of the Medical Office. There was general reservation and concern

expressed about such an effort involving as it did potentially

controversial and highly speculative efforts... It was felt that such

activity, involving as this did an American citizen, might be outside oi

the Agency's purview.. It was recognized that such efforts, waile

desirable in some quarters, could be misunderstood, misinterpretea, ana

mistakenly considered to have been derived fron the doctor-patient

therapeutic relationship which was in fact far from the case. An initial

effort was prepared by Dr.

under the

direction of myself

based upon a review of magazine and newspaper articles containing

biographical data about Ellsberg, as well as some FBI documents consisting

of Interview reports by informants about Ellsberg.

3. On 12 August 1971, on instructions fron the Director of

Medical Services, the writer met with It. Davia Young, Roon 16, Executive

Oifice Building, to discuss the matter of a psychiatric write-up on the

case of Daniel Ellsberg. Vir. Young, at the time the appointment was made,

had stated that there was more information which he wished to discuss.

The meeting lasted for approximately an hour and Mr. Young was joined by

a lir. Linney (probably Liddy), who seemed to be an assistent. Mr. Young

stated that the Ellsberg study had the highest priority and had been

requested by Mr. Ehrlichman and Dr. Kissinger. Vir. Young also stated that

the President had been informed of this study. He stated that it as

multi-faceted approach and the psychiatric report would be only one facet.

He stated that he understood that the Agency was uneasy about undertaking

such a study and assured me that there had been no delineation as to how

Infornation derived from the study would be utilized, and 1i there were

any utilization that great care would be given to make it nonattributable

to the Agency. Mr. Young was interested in knowing waat kind of data

would be needed in order to provide further study of the sort done

"on Fidel Castro." Ister on Mr. Howard Hunt joined the group'. Mr. Hunt

recognized me, being a former Agency employee, and we greeted cordially.

Ir. Hunt amplified on lir. Young's conments and stated it was his wish to

"try Di. Ellsberg In public."' Other comments were made by fir. Funt or

"Mr. Linney" to the effect that the aim would be to render Dr. Ellsberg

Ineffective or to make him the object of pity as a broken man. Mr. Hunt

stated that he wished to see data of the sort that "psychiatrists found out

about Barry Goldwater in 1964," and he expressed interest in being able

to refer in a knowledgeable way to Dr. Ellsberg's oedipal conflicts or

castration fears and

other similar points.

4. It seemed from Mr. Young and. "Mr. Linney" that there was

considerable concern that Dr. Ellsberg had a great deal more sensitive

information which it was feared he would from time to time periodically

expose.

"ur. Linney" stated that Dr. Ellsberg thought of himself as

"having the white hat and the President as having the black hat."

## Page 5

5. A discussion wes held with the group concerning the dangers

0i

preparing such a study in isolation and ithout the opportunity for the

free give and take discussions among

experts, as had been the case in our

other studies. I was informed that more biographic material vas available.

I was requested to give examples of the kind of information needed. I

pointed out that insofar as possible, "although possibly not available,"

data from early life from nurses or close relatives vould be useful. I

agreed with "Mr. Linney" that school progress, including testing, would be

helpful. In the same way, year books, his years in college and in the

military, comments fron friends vould be helpful. Mr. Hunt also stated

that it would be useful for Dr. Ellsberg's first wife to be interviewed

and he felt, "You can easily arrange that under an operational alias."

It was pointed out that the first Mrs.. Ellsberg would be cooperative.

6.. Information was also offered by ir. Hunt or "vr. Linney" to

the effect that Dr. Ellsberg had been in analysis although times or

location vere not knom for certain. "ir. Linney" pointed out that after

DI. Ellsberg gave the Pentegon papers away, he telephoned his analyst

stating, "Now I am free."

7. "Ir. Linney" end lir. Yound, with Ir. Hunt's assent, pointed

out that the Illsberg study was of the highest priority, even over the

SALI negotiations. It was agreed that the further biographic information

regarding Dr. Ellsberg would be sent to us and Mr. Funt agreed to manage

this. Ir. Hunt would also make arrangements whereby periodic conferences

would be held as necessary. Mc. Hunt did, however, offer that he did not

Trish to come out to the Agency if he could avoid it.

8.

At this point Mr. Hunt made sone comments in the presence of

the group based on his previous acquaintanceship with me and he remained

behind and made some further coments expressing a desire that nis

presence and participation in the neeting not be mentioned at the Agency.

After arriving back at the Agency I inforned Mr. Hunt by telephone that

it was not feasible for me to avoid reporting Mr. Hunt's presence at the

meeting. it. Hunt expressed great regret that this was necessary,

stating that he had adequate contact with General Cushman and was on good

terns with the Director. He was reluctant in agreeing to my statenent

that it was necessary to inform the Director of Medical Services.

Mir. Hunt wished to know if this could be treated as confidential medical

information, but could not tell the writer in what way. I discussed the

entire situation--the dangers and the reservations and the gravity of

the situation with the Deputy Chief, Psychiatric Staff, the Director

and Deputy Director of Medical Services.

9. On 13 August 1971, additional infornation was received from

the White House. To the best of my knowledge this was from Howard Hunt

and consisted of poorly Xeroxed classified FBI reports and Departnent of

State documents. This material provided additional data and on

20 August 1971 the Director of Medical Services and the writer met with

the Deputy Director for Support concerning the White House request in

the Ellsberg case and the continuing pressure and desire for a psychiatric

study. The problems associated with developing the study and our

continuing reservations were discussed in detail. In view of Vir. Hunt's

enthusiasm, concerns existed about the checks and balances to actions

based on a study If one were to be undertalien. Io the best of ty recall

the Deputy Director for Support was in agreement with us. Wile the

additional information furnished further suggested that Ellsberg was

under emotional pressure it was not possible to arrive at any firm

conclusions or comprehensive understanding of the man's personality.

The additional information indicated that:

a. He had revealed quasi-Secret information while

still in the service when he was applying for a

Ph.D. fellowship.

b.

He had volunteered for Vietnamese service for the

State Department In 1955 while under the stress of

c.

obtaining a divorce from his first

wife.

He had sought psychoanalytic treatment betveen the

fall of 1968 and 1970 with a psychoanalyst. (who was

determined to be professionally qualified and

reputable) in California.

## Page 7

d. He may have been involved in leaking information

about a Soútin Vietnamese in 1970 vile he was

actually in psychoanalytic treatment.

To the best of my recollection it was agreed that the

implications of the above data would be orally discussed by me with

Mc. Hunt, Ir. Liddy and li. Young.

It was also agreed that there would

be the greatest reluctance

to undertake any interview of the former

Mrs. Ellsberg, and it was hoped that after this a written document would

not be necessary.

10. The Deputy Director for Support considered advising the

DCI, but it was decided that I would first visit Mr. Young and inform him

that the additional material basically provided for no further

understanding. It was hoped that this would put an end to the situation,

but if further material was forwarded the matter would have to be dealt.

with at that time.

11. The Deputy Director for Support stated that after the meeting

with Me. Young, the DCI would be brought up to date.

12. Following the meeting on Friday, 20 August, and in accord

with the discussions on that date, a call was placed on Monday, 23 August,

to Mr. David Young at the White House.' Mr. Young was informed that we

had received the materiel which had been forwarded and that ve had

considered it, and would be available to discuss the data further.

Mr. Young

stated that he would have lr. Hunt call me. He stated that

Ir. Hunt's office was elsewhere in the building and he did not have his

number immediately available. As of 27 August 1971 Mr. Hunt had not

called me.

13. On 30 September 1971, there is a yellow menorandum of a

telephone call to me from David Young at the White House with the

message that Mr. Hunt suggested meeting Wednesdey, 27 October, at 11:00 a•I.

SUBJECI: Meeting With Mr. David Young

1. In connection with instructions from the Director of Medical Services,

an appointment was arranged for 12 August 1971 at 2:00 PM with Mr. David Young,

Room 16, Executive Office Building, to discuss further psychiatric input in

of Daniel Ellsberg.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meeting with DD/S and D/MS Regarding Daniel Ellsberg

D/MS and the writer today spoke with the DD/S concerning the

White House request on the Ellsberg case. D/MS made three points

with which the writer is in agreement:

a) The additional information furnished provides further

evidence that Ellsberg was under pressure.. Nontheless, the additional

material provided does not allow for any substantive conclusions or

understanding of this man's personality. He sought psychoanalytic

treatment between the fall of 1968 and 1970 with a qualified and

reputable psychoanalyst in California.

The allegation that after leaking

the Rand study that he called the analyst and stated, "now I'm free"

would

suggest that Ellsberg was still involved in dealing with problems which

either brought him to analysis or which were uncovered in the course of

the treatment.

In going to Vietnam for the State Department in 1965 while

involved in obtaining a divorce from his first wife, he had sought to

discharge internal tension by taking action; his añalÿtic treatment was

unsuccessful in altering this propensity. Ellsberg

revealed secret

information in the course of applying for a Ph.D. fellowship while still

in the service; he may have been involved in leaking information about a

South Vietnamese in 1970 prior to leaking the Rand study: These actions

may have also been the resultants of internal pressures--the 1970 incident

while he was actually in analysis.

b): There is hesitation about the Psychiatric Staff undertaking

to interview the former Mrs. Ellsberg.

It was agreed that there would be

a great professional reluctance at such a procedure.

c)

There is considerable concern about the use to which the

requested study would be put.

In view of Mr. Hunt/s enthusiasm, concerns

exist about the checks and balances to actions based on a study if one

were to be undertaken.

It was decided that at this point the writer

would again visit Mr. Young

and inform him orally that the additional

material provided allows for no further understanding other than as noted

above.

It was agreed that the writer would not accept any requirements

to undertake to interview the former Mrs. Ellsberg.

It is hoped that this

will put an end to the situation, but if
