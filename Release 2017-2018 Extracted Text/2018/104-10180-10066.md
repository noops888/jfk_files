Dearne the first president of the FEY after castro care to powers

asa jent leader in 195} PUENTE was elected president of the
Hava “niveraity Student ‘inion. At that time he and his brother, doberto
fot into trounle with Satista, so in 1955, when Datista clesed the
university, PUHTE continued to conspire against Batista and eventually
had to epcape to Veresuela in order to save his neck, ‘e subsequently
cane to the U.S, In $3 he left the US snd found his way into the
Eseanbray rountains where he joined anti-Yatista forces, not necessarily
Castro furces, for there were rany ® anti-Satista gro-ps in the nountain
at that time. 'e did, however, Join Castro forces as the carpaign
MBER neared its clinx.

After the successful revoit, FULNTE saREOE returned :
to Hava University to continue his law studies. He was elected the

FEU preatdent in a close election against studenis backed by Castro.

U Ona could probably and perhars properly IER that Jose is
2 Castro agent, but aside from the episode dealing with his release,

gt the benest of Thelma King, and the wt that he carried

with hin,after his release fron prison, 150 scholarshipef which
arpe-rs to have sone sicnificance, there is no conclusive evidence
pointing toward Jose's involvenent,im fast or present, with Castro's
security apparat.
__There is, however, considerably nore evidence that he is not
an agert of Castros Por examples
1. He has fought against Castro and was ixprisoned by hin,
2. tir le has reportedly denounced Thelma King openly.
3. Reese be does net get along with his brother Jorge, who
4s tied in with Pinfero. :
U. He has broadcastéd anti-Castro and anti-Batista
propaganda fran Radio CIENMIL, a panananian station.
S. SEE iq oaitasteo, Anti-Communist and pro-
democratic land thst his actions, accarding to Jose,
since 1953 should speak for thenselves, including
his actions and propaganda work against Castro since

his arrival in the United St-tes.

I don't b-Lieve I'm that naive to think that Jose's
actions to date couls not be part of a pre-arranged plan, but
the evidence available points in the ovher direction.
I do succest SH to possible alternatives, the first of which
I prefer:
1, Apprise Ray of this infornaticn snd let hin deterrine

Puente's bona fides; caution him to be ciscreet with his future plans fi
