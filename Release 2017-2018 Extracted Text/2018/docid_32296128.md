DETAILS:

A. PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

SAMUEL MANNARINO

1. Status of Health

It has been reported previously that a source stated that

as of September 1, 1959, SAM MANNARINO was drinking to excess,

being drunk almost every day.

On December 11, 1959, PG T-1, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised that SAMUEL MANNARINO is

not drunk daily but is under the influence of narcotics

which he takes to minimize the pain he is suffering Irom

his spreading abdominal malignancy.

PG T-l estimates that

this malignancy will

, result in SAM MANNARINO's death by

the Summer of 1960.

C. ASSOCIATES

• 1. JOSEPH MEROLA

It has been reported previously that JOSEPH MEROLA, Miami,

Florida, formerly of Pittsburgh, Pa., is a MANNARINO

underling.

On September 18, 1959, HANS G. MILTON, 845 Southwest Fourth

Street, Miami, Florida, advised SA GEORGE E. DAVIS as follows:

explained that JOE MEROLA, of Miami Beach, had,a Cuban girl

friend who could arrange for the purchase

of this boat.

CASADA took MILTON to the Garden of Allah Motel and Apartments,

Miami Beach, where the boat "Menace" was docked. MILTON tested

the engines and told CASADA that they would have to be fixed,

after which CASADA told MILTON that he might use this boat

within a short time for an excursion into the Florida Keys.

CASADA then took MILTON to JOE MEROLA's apartment in the

Garden of Allah Motel. MEROLA told MILTON that he owned the

"Menace."

CASADA then told MILTON that some Cuban friends of

MEROLA's were tired, needed a change and wanted to

the boat encountered more serious engine trouble. The Cubans

went ashore in a dinghy to obtain aid.

In the meantime,

storm came up and the boat began to leak, forcing MILTON

beach it on a sand bar. Later that night, A menacef. the

to

United 'States Customs Service, searched the

but found

no guns or other contraband.

MILTON later learned that this

trip was actually intended to have been a military expedition

to Cuba and that the Agents of the U.S. Customs Service had

taken into custody three of the individuals who had been

passengers on the

"Menace."

MILTON later attempted to contact

JOE MEROLA but could not locate him..

The following information relating to the revolutionary

activities of JOSEPH MEROLA was developed by the New York

Office as a result of contact with the Alcohol and Tobacco

Tax Division, New

York City.

On August 5, 1959, RONALD MOSS

and Tobacco

Special Investigator RUDOLPH KALES conducted an investigation

in September, 1958, concerning an attempt by JOSEPH MEROLA to

purchase firearms from an ATTD informant in the vicinity of

New York.

On September 26, 1958, the ATTD informant contacted Special

Investigator KALES to report that a representative of Cuban

revolutionary. leader JOSE ALEMAN requested the informant to

meet with a leader of the Mafia named JOSEPH MEROLA.

Several

days later, the informant met with MEROLA and two Cubans in

an apartment in the vicinity of 138th Street and Riverside

Drive, New York City.

During the meeting, MEROLA pointed out

that he was associated with ALEMAN and that he was interested

in purchasing large quantities of firearms, including machine

guns. MEROLA told the informant that he had been responsible

for

supplying over a million dollars worth of arms during the

Cuban revolution and that he and his associates anticipated

extensive gambling concessions in Cuba from the revolutionary

government.

On the basis of this information, the ATTD, New York City,

temporarily loaned the informant

a number of confiscated weapons

PROLA * that he would have a representative stock to show to

and had requested the informant to accumulate a large pile

of American

"stuff" for him.

MEROLA also told the informant

at that time that he would have to postpone any purchase of

arms since the Miami area was swarming with FBI Agents looking

for stolen weapons.

On August 10, 1959, the ATTD informant was interviewed by

Special Agents of the FBI in New York City. During this

interview,

the informant confirmed the foregoing information

and positively identified a photograph of JOSEPH MEROLA,

although he could not identify a photograph of Pittsburgh

national top hoodlum SAM MANNARINO.

2. MIKE GEORGE HAZIDAKIS

On September 21, 1959, PG T-2, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised as follows:

Although MIKE HAZIDAKIS is back in his native Greece, he still

receives

a. "cut" of the proceeds from the gambling casino on

Barnes Street, New Kensington, Pa., known as Triangle Billiards.

When HAZIDAKIS was in Greece

the time before this, JOHN VOZOS,

proprietor of a beer distributorship at the intersection of

Third Avenue and Ninth Street, New Kensington, received

HAZIDAKIS' share of the casino's proceeds and turned it over

to him when he returned to the United States. The amount

was in the neighborhood of $5,000. VOZOS is not holding

HAZIDAKIS'

share this time and PG T-2 does

not know who is

holding it.

It is noted that it has been reported previously that MIKE

GEORGE HAZIDAKIS, a trusted cashier at the Triangle Billiards

gambling casino in New Kensington, returned to Greece in the

early part of 1959.

3. JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

It is noted that it has been reported previously that JOHN

CHRISTOPHER FONTANA is the number one lieutenant in the

MANNARINO organization.

On October 6, 1959, PG I-2 advised that on September 30, 1959,

colored Lincoln Sedan, bearing Illinois license

c20-55545, was in New Kensington, Pa., for approximately two

hours,

commencing at 7:45 PM.

He said that the driver, about

ADMINISTRATIVE

It is noted that it was set out in rerep that PCI JAMES

THORNTON MCCLOWRY, MD, Springdale, Pa., advised that Father

NICOLA, FUSCO, Pastor of Mt. Sto-Peters Roman Catholic

Church, New Kensington, Pa., was close to the MANNARINOS,

and in late 1958, hid SAMUEL MANNARINO in the church's

apostulate house when SAMUEL MANNARINO was being sought

for service of a subpoena.

On July 23, 1959, PCI MCCLOWRY, advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH,

III, as

follows:

on about July 13, 1959, Father FUSCO asked PCI if he would

give SAM MANNARINO a thorough physical examination. PCI

replied that if cancer were indicated, he could do nothing

for MANNARINO, at which point Father FUSCO indicated he knew

that MANNARINO waS

suffering from a malignancy. PCI feels

there are only two reasons why he should be approached to

examine MANNARINO: eithe SAM MANNARINO is frightened and

looking desperately for other, contrary medical opinion;

or MANNARINO intends to "use"

at a later date to testify that MANNARINO is too ill to appear

in any court proceeding. PCI wanted to know if there was any

reason the FBI would not want him to examine SAM MANNARINO,

and PCI was advised that any decision along this line was his

alone.

On September 15, 1959, PCI MCCLOWRY advised that Father

FUSCO and his chauffeur departed on September 11, 1959, by

jet airline flight to Rome, Italy, purpose of visit unknown.

PCI stated that this trip was paid for in its entirety by

the MANNARINOS. PCI also advised that prior to Father

FUSCO's depature, Father FUSCO told PCI that it would not

be necessary for him to give a physical examination to

SAMUEL MANNARINO, inasmuch as MANNARINO has become more or

less resigned to the inevitability of his death from his

cancer.
