Action: Information only

1. Transmitted herewith are two memoranda concerning
the request by a U.S. lawyer to examine some photographs taken
in September and October 1963 of an unidentified American
entering the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. The 18 September 1972
memorandum is from local LNERGO and provides background -- related
to an interest in the Lee Harvey Oswald case -- of the
lawyer's request. Our reply, dated 19 September 1972, is self-
explanatory.

2. %It appears likely that the lawyer concerned will pursue

his interest in the photos, and therefore we want you to be aware
of his request.
