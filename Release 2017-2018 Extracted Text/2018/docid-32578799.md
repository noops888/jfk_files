He claimed

that CIA was using Cuban exiles only insofar as

these exiles

further the "selfish aims" of CIA and that CIA refuses to work

with Cuban organizations which are not totally controlled by

ClA, ana in some instances, ClA would go to the extant of

harassing certain exile Cuban organizations which did not do

as CIA wanted and in this regard indicated that the MDC has

been harassed in the past for disagreements with CIA.

The enclosed LHM has been classified "Confidential"

because it contains informationso classified by CIA gage) (u)

this matter but will remain alert for activities of the MDC.
