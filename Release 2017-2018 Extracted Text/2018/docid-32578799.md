Goserr GRANVILLE HENRIQUES] obtains his information :
concerning activities of the MDC frém GASPAR VILATO, SRfgeet HS)

During the interview conducted with GASPAR VILATO, OR.
he gave every indication of being sincere and of giving an
honest opinion of the MDC as he saw the organization.

VILATO, during the interview, was openly critical
of the CIA for its past blunders regarding Cuba. He claimed
that CIA was using Cuban exiles only insofar as these exiles
further the "selfish aims" of CIA and that CIA refuses to work
with Cuban organizations which are not totally controlled by
CIA, and in some instances, CIA would go to the extant of
harassing certain exile Cuban organizations which did not do
as CIA wanted and in this regard indicated that the MDC has
been harassed in the past for disagreements with CIA,

‘The enclosed LHM has been classified "Configential"
because it contains information{$o classified by CIA Sepa (u)

The NYO contemplates no further investigation in
this matter but will remain alert for activities of the MDC.
