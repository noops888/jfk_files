(B val Anticipating) the Ambassador's arrival, NORMAN

WARREN, JOHN HACEY and (B val company) have redoubled their

I believe that it is preferable to make these transfers

without the opinion of any unfriendly person. This action

is always considered unfriendly.

President DUVALIER has asked for these recalls to permit

Ambassador TIMMONS to be the [1 gr G] of a Haitian-United States

rapprochement. Therefore, as we say, the departure of JOHN

HACEY (B val and company) is imperative.

We are expecting your immediate reply.

You have seen, My dear IRVING, that the recall of

WARREN, WARNER, HASSEY, MOSS and TIMMONS must be obtained.
