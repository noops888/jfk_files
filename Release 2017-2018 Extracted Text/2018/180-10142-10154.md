Mr. Scelso. This was all on the same day.

Mr. Goldsmith. The cable traffic was pretty heavy on
that day, I would imagine.

Mr. Scelso. Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. This cable is the first time that the

Mexico City station informs Headquarters about Oswald's

9/27 contacts.

Mr. Scelso. Yes.

Mc. Goldsmith. Do you think that there is any connec-
tion between the fact that this contact was recorded after

the Mexico City station became aware of the fact that] Litensez

knew about Oswald's contacts?

Mr. Scelso. I would imagine that there were probably

things and some got finished before others.
Mr. Goldsmith. This was months ago. The conversations.
have been transcribed and reviewed months earlier.
Mr. Scelso. What are the numbers of the various cables
They were all going out in Geeec ies! They may have had
several analysts in the Mexico Station working on them. One
said you take this one and write a cable and the other said

you take that one and write a cable, and so on, and they wenc
