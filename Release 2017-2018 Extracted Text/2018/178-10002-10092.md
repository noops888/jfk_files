with the Agency of the development or discussions of any plans
concerning the possible assassination of Patrice Lumumba?

A I don't recall anything about any plans to assassinate!
Patxice Lumumba, I know that Lumumba was a controversial figure!
at the time. I know whatever year this was -- was in the
Eisenhower or the Kennedy era that Lumumba was riding high.

Q I believe that the era would -have been in the era of
1959, '60, I believe he was killed in early ‘61.

A I remember later hearing all kinds of allegations
about Lumumba and how he had been killed and why he had been
killed. I remember also the fact that the -- it was abundantly
clear that the Agency had had nothing to do with his demise

but whether there was a plot on the Agency at sometime or

“a GTWaaS FHL HOYT AdODOLOHA

another to try to bring about his demise I was not familiar with
it. I want to say here I will obviously do the very best f

can with my recollection but when you consider how much has been!

avddIT qaor

in the newspapers about a number of things in the last period off

pt

years it is pretty hard to stick in time when you first heard
about something.

All I am trying to convey here is I was not as far as I
know privy to any ongoing plan to get rid of Patrice Lumumba
by assassination.

Qa Now, the dictator of the Dominican Republic, ee rf
Trujillo, was killed on or about May 30, '61. Prior to that

time were you aware of the fact that there had been a request

made of the Agency to deliver guns to dissidents in the
Dominican Republic?

A I don't believe I was familiar with it at the time
although I can't say. I certainly heard about the gun business
later because I had occasion to go back when President Johnson
asked me about this episode at one time to look into the records
to find out about Trujillo. I could find no evidence that the
Agency. had been responsibie for his demise but I did find
evidence at the time that there was an opposition group in the
United States Government was anxious to have the Agency support
and assist and I think I may very well have known about the
opposition group at the time,

I have no recollection any longer that I was privy to the
sending of any guns fotto the Dominican Republic and if I was,
I don't recall they were ever identified as being designed-to
kill Mr. Trujillo. I know there was a desire on the part of
whatever Administration was in power then, they didn't like Mr.
Trujillo. They like Mr. Duvalier apd certain others but I was
aware of no attempts to bring about his death through Agency
assets.

I think ee you' have raised this question of an assassi-
nation I would like to say something as a generality here.

Dearly in the game when Colonel Galloway was my boss in
what was then known as the Office of Special Operations, I don't

even recall any more in what connection this came up but he said

to me one day that the Agency. should certainly have the
capability to get rid of foreigners when required and that this
had to be done secretly and you should never ask your boss for
permission to do these things, and so forth. I remember at the
time arguing with him about this and saying that I though that
there was no possibility whatever that the United States Govern4
ment could develop a capacity to kill people because you could

never keep it a secret. Sooner or later, maybe after five years

In fact, I have often said to associates that there are

that any of those things were going to be satisfactory to me,

Castro, one was Trujillo, and do. you remember what the third
was?

A Diem,

Q And I think you have already testified about that.

A I just did, because President Johnson had raised these
cases with me and I thought that since he had done it he might
have raised them with President Nixon and early in his Admini-
stration I wanted to get him straightened out on this.

You know, to this day I am not persuaded that President
Nixon doesn't still believe that the Agency didn't have. somethin|
to do with the demise of President Diem of Vietnam and there is
absolutely no evidence of this in the Agencyrrecords and the
whole thing has been, I mean, rather -= what is the word I want
~~ heated by the fact that President Johnson used to go around
saying that the reason President Kennedy was assassinated was

that he had assassinated President Diem and this was just i

justice. He certainly used to say that in the early days of his
Presidency and where he got this {dea from I don't know. I
don't know how many of you had the privilege of trying to argue
with Presidents about things like that but you tend to be a
loser.

Qa Let me just digress on that one point for the moment.
Before we get back to Mr. Castro. After the election in Chile, ,
I believe it was in 1970 where Allende derived a plurality, °

President Nixon called you or contacted you to ascertain if

Qa Do you recall any request made by the President or
‘anyone else in the White House that the Agency funnel funds and
also even perahps ‘submachine, guns to see if. something could be
done to prevent the legislature from electing him?

A Well, certainly they wanted the legislature not to
elect President Allende. The Nixon Administration certainly

didn't want that. “My recollection of the circumstance, though,

of the election and,although there was a great deal of
pressure to do something about it, I don't recall our finding
any way that we could have done it.

Q Do you recall that there was..a.specific direction
from the President that you not advise the Secretary of
State of this request from the White House? . Do you ever
recall that being done?

A No, I don't recall his saying it in this connection
but, Mr. Belin, let me just say that this was a favorite
device of President Nixon, Don't tell so and so. Be sure
you keep this secret. So I am not questioning the fact that
he might very well have said it. On the other hand, I don't
recall it in this connection.

Q In what connection do you recall his telling you
not to tell the Secretary of State about it?

A Oh, I think these were things having to do with
Vietnam and Southeast Asia,as best I recall.

Q Do you recall his ever telling you not to tell any~
thing about this particular subject involving Chile to
the Forty Committee?

A No. I don't remember that.

Q I assume that if the President would have told you
not to tell the Secretary of State, you would have followed
the direction of the President.

A Oh, of course.

Q And if he told you not to tell the Forty Committee
you would have followed his direction on that?

A Yes. After all, these devices are part of his
office.

Q And if he told you not to tell the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board you would follow his
direction there?

A Yes. I think there. would be no question about it.
He was my boss.

Q And if he told you not to tell Congressional over-
sight committees you would follow his direction there?

A I never recall having discussed that with him, ‘not
eee the Congress. I don't recall any conversations of
that kind.

Q Well, if he would have told you that --

A Nor do I recall any conversations about the
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. If you
have evidence that he asked me not to tell them something
I won't challenge it but the President's Foreign Advisory
Board quite frankly, never loomed in his mind large enough
to be, I don't think, as a considered factor.

Q The Committee was not performing a true oversight
function. Would that be a fair statement?

A The President's Foreign Intelligence Board?

Q Yes.

A No. I don't want to identify myself with that
statement because they had their own way that they thought
they were doing their job and I assume they thought they
were doing it and I never regarded them as an oversight
organization.

Q Well, if the President would have told you to
refrain from commenting about a subject to the Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board --

A I would have found no strain with that at all.

Q And if he would have told you not to tell a
particular thing to a Congressional oversight committee,
how would you -~

A I don't know. I might have argued with him about
that depending upon what it was, because there you have
a different kind of a situation. After all, the President is
the bass. of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. He
appoints it and they are his creatures, and so is the
Secretary of State, and so are his assistants in the White
House. After all, under our system of Government the President
rides supreme over the Executive Branch, so if he tells
somebody there not to tell somebody else he has got every

right, I assume, to do so.

With a Congressional committee you are under a different’

situation because there you have a coordinate branch of the

Government where his writ does not obtain, necessarily.

Q And so what you are saying is to the extent that
there is a Legislative Branch of the Government, that would
basically depend upon what the particular request of the

President was?

A Yes, and I think if I thought he was asking me to

deprive them of something they had a right to have, I would
certainly have an argument with him’about it because after
all, I have to live with both,or a Director has to live with
both.

Q And hypothetically if you argue with him and you do
not convince him then what would you disposition be?

Ambassador Helms. When approximately did you first become

you are referring. to because during the years of the Kennedy
Administration, there was a flat-out effort ordered by
the White House, the President, Bobby Kennedy who was after’ |

it by whatever device could be found and thati.was the

reason for mounting this large.operation in Miami to work

on this very problem. And the Bay of Pigs was a part of. this
effort and after the Bay 6f Pigs failed, there was even a
greater push to try to get rid of this Communist influence 90
miles from the United States shores.

The business about the assassination of Castro, I have
read about this in the papers. T'hiave heard about it from
associates. It has been kicked around whether this was a
viable proposition or not. I have no doubt it was written
into various plans as one of Many options but I don't recall
any successful effort that was made in this direction and
since Castro is alive and apparently well in Havana, the
extent to which this was serious!I have never ascertained.

Q Do you recall the fact that poison pills were

developed to be delivered to assets or to people in Cuba for

Castro?

A Were poison pills taken to Cuba? I never knew any-

about poison. pills or any of that. What I want to say in this
connection is the fact that I never heard about this doesn't
mean that there were ma-y, many ideas discussed in the Agency ii

Q Do you -~

A Whose idea was this? Do you have the information?
Q Well --

A I recall somebody discussing with me one day an

even crazier idea which had to do with some kind of. a thing
that might be planted on the beach where Castro walked in the
morning and it would blow up when he put his foot on it, or
something. There were more nutty ideas. It reminded me of
the time of OSS when somebody wanted to get propaganda into
Germany and they discovered there was a herd of cows that
grazed in Germany and were milked in France, so they devised
some suppositories into which there were put a lot of
propaganda leaflets and those were put in the cows on the
theory they were being left on ‘the German side of the border
when the cows were grazing and nobody would be the wiser.
So to say there are. nutty ideas cooked up in organizations
like this is to tell the truth.

Is there any evidence, may I ask, Mr.Belin, is
there any evidence in the record that any Director authorized
what I can only refer to. by the dictionary definition of
an assassination of a foreign leader?

Q Well, there is evidence in the record, Ambassador
Helms, that there were plans made to try and assassinate
Premier Castro of Cuba, that there were several series of

plans, and that the plans at at least one or two of the

which did not start, I believe, in the DDP area. It started
in the Office of.Security, if I recollect, to what I found
in the record at one time. I-believe it was Colonel Edwards

Q I believe that is accurate.

A And when Harvey acquired Roselli, we had an ongoing
liability and.I.had been told he hdd':been asked to do. these

brief Robert Kennedy as the Attorney General about the
existence of Roselli and various things that the Agency had
had to do with him-and I believe that -- this I have been

Q And who told you this?

A I don't recall. It may have been Houston, may have

reviewed it when there was-a story in the Chicago -- one
of the’tChicago newspapers some years ago about this whole
Roselli business, that I asked for the records:and*lookéed:at
them at that time.

can. You can call this, if. you would Helms! Exhibit 1.

1963, headlines "CIA Sought Giancana. Help for Cuba Spying."

I want you to examine this and see if. perhaps that is
what you had reference to in feference to the Chicago
stories.

A It could very easily be. It looks just like what
I recall came out at the time and I think somehow or other
this name Sandy Smith sticks in my mind as being the writer. + :
of the article in geustion. So I have no reason to doubt that’

this is the article we are talking about.

briefed about: something. I mean, after all, one of the bases
on which this Agency has always operated was that the Director
was privy to know anything that went on. That was established
early in the game.

the Director, or he shouldn't be briefed?

Q Well, there has been testimony and there is documen-

discussion might have been had.- .

White House that had to do with counter-insurgency as I-
recall it.

Q Would that be the Special Operations group?

problems of Cuba and Latin America, and so forth, and also
problems all around the world ~- how are we going to organize

problem? I am sure there must be records of this thing. It
used to meet all the time down at the Executive Office
Building. It had.met a lot on Asia, as I recall it, and the

problem in Vietnam, and so forth, and I have no doubt there

was some organization that we. used to report to regularly abou

our progress in the Cuban thing. I forget which committee
it was but.certainly, the.Attorney. General was right there
all the time. Joe Califano.was involved from the Army

Department in these matters. I don't know. There were other

people. Ihave forgotten now all the -- that is a long time

A Well, the principal driving force was the Attorney
General, Robert Kennedy. There isn't any question about this.
Involved in this was a group of individuals who were sort of
hired and pulled together by Kennedy and Rusk and McNamara
and McGeorge Bundy and all those people to get on with this
job and as I sit here and start to think about this,

Califano was one of them. It seems to me Lansdale, who had
been successful in this kind of operation out in the Far

East was brought in for a while. There was a small office

of these discussions particularly.

anybody that they could lay their hands on. This was a --

pretty fulsome but when you come down to this question of a

of lying on the part of those Cubans and a lot of backing and
forthing with allegations of things that happened that never
did happen and as I. look back on the whole period, with

all the effort that was made in money and manpower, and

so. forth, devoted to try and unseat the Castro government,
when one looks back at it it was a pretty pitiful effort

and I think a great deal of it was just, what shall I say,
talking a good game.

Q Now, do you: have any recollection of any briefing
of McCone about any Agency plans in which Harvey or Roselli
or Sheffield Edwards may have been involved other than
Exhibit 4?

A I don't have any recollection of that, Mr. Belin.

I want to tell you that all I recall was that McCone was

constantly asking about how we were getting along with the
Cuban operations and McCone was constantly being briefed about
what we were trying to do about these operations but what

was in all those briefings I. have. no recollection any more

at all and no matter how I would work on this I would never
be able to sort it all out. It was:-- a lot of effort was

being made, all kinds of things to get boats and to train

A May I ask a question at this juncture? Since Castro
is alive and well in Cuba, what is the problem about these
-- trying to verify all this business about whether these
attempts were made or not made? I mean, does it make any

difference any more?

Q Well, there are two major areas of concern apart

from whether or not assassination should play any part in
American policy. One area concerns how the plans were
authorized, whether they were directed externally or whether
they grewup internally.

The second area concerns what I would call internal moni-
toring and control. If Mr.McCone.didn't know about it, other
than that briefing, that. poses a. problem so far as an Agency
operating under control. If you did not know about it..until
the spring of 1962, and the information that I have.gathered
indicates that you were. not privy to any information about
this until the spring of 1962,. you.were in a fairly important -

position in the Agency and yet were not*aware of what could

have been a potentially disastrous operation, certainly. an

operation that had all kinds of ramifications for this~

country when one considers the trigger of World War I involved

an assassination attempt.

And so, therefore, the’ scope of my inquiry is not Y

necessarily to say it is this'person's responsibility but in "

large part it is to determine how these plans got organized

and how they were kept under control, and I should tell you
that it is my information that, although you did not have any
information about this prior to the spring of 1962, that
inthe spring of 1962 you were made privy to what I am going to
call Phase I which was the Giancana phase and also what I am
going to call Phase II when William Harvey took over the
operation, and that Mr.McCone, according to the records that
I have seen, was not briefed until the August 16, 1963
memorandum, in part because of the fact Mr.McCone had not
been DCI: at the time the plans were undertaken, so the
documents say that I have seen, and that at the time of his
briefing in August of 1963, it was not an oral briefing. but
rather limited to a discussion.of the Giancana matter:in
the memorandum for the record addressed to Senator Kennedy,
Exhibit 4.

Now, is there anything that.I have said which disagrees
with anything that is to the best of your recollection?

A I have no reason to cavil with what you say. I
don't have any contrary recollections but I don't remember a
lot of this either. So --

Q Now, do you remember Senator Kennedy coming over
to the Agency on or about March 8, 1967, to review this
memorandum for the records that was Helms' Exhibit 4 that
pertained to his 1962 briefing? :

A Senator Kennedy visited the Agency to do that?

in my office here.

Q Do you have any recollection of a project known

as Project Amlash?

A Amlash? By that name, not any more,
Q Did you ever?
A Don't forget, Mr. Belin, that there were hundreds

of these things.

Q Do you have any recollection of any man by the
name of Rolando Cubela who was a Cuban who at one time had
been associated with Castro and then became disaffected
with him?

A Let's see, Was he the fellow who eventually ended
up in Paris or Madrid or Somethin of this kind?

Q Yes. At one time he did and then eventually

he ended up in Cuba but he was met by Agency people in Paris.

A What was his particular cryptonym?

Q Well, among other things; some Black Leaf 40.had
been developed to be delivered to him in a pen which had been
constructed to have a hypodermic needle with. the:object. to
inject the Black Leaf 40 into Castro. And that was delivered
to: himiin Paris on November 22, 1963. Do you remember?

A I certainly: remember Cubela.. I certainly remember ‘
the fact that he was, I think -- was he a defector from the

Cuban regime.

A Or was he an agent whom we recruited who had not
yet defected or what? I certainly remember his name and I
certainly remember the-:yse that was made of a fellow named
Cubela but I don't recall exactly for what.

Q There was an effort to recruit him in place.
There were eventually some weapons delivered to him,

A Were there? I don't have any reason to doubt it.

The Black Leaf 40 and the hypodermic pen, and so forth, I

Q Do you recall any Agency scheme which involved tryin
to put a spectacular seashell in an area --

A That is what I was talking about earlier. .womebody
was talking once about trying to put a bomb on his beach
where he walked, or something.

Q or where he skin-dived.

A Yes, that is the idea. I do remember somebody
discussing whether that would be aviable operation or not.

Q Do you ever remember anyone discussing giving
Castro a skin-diving suit which would include some tuberculosil
bacteria in the breathing apparatus and also possibly some

fungus which would produce madura foot?

A Madura foot? I remémber,it seems to me, Fitzgerald *

the skin-diving suit was but I want to tell you these came
up every day, some hairbrained.idea like this to do some-
thing about Cuba, but that these actually were carried out,
I don't recall any’ instances of it. I don't recall any approvals
given to actually set the seashell down or to send the thing
or that any assets were developed to do these things. These
were a lot of things: that were discussed and I am sure they
got down on paper since you have them but I don't recall they
were ever approved or ever carried out or any attempt to
carry them out.

Q Do you remember that eventually arms were delivered
to Mr.Cubela in Cuba?

A I don't: have any doubt about it. I think we
delivered arms all over the place in-connection with Cuba.

bring his government down by whatever device could be found.
Q -: Which could include assassination?

A I don't know that the word assassination was ever

i

used but certainly if you land armed men-on a beach. and the
effort is to recruit other armed men.and to try to start a
whole arrangement whereby you, you: know, you bring down a
government, sombeody is bound to get shot. But the thing
that I am doing my level best with you about and which even
as I sit here thinking about it, is the focus on this
assassination business as though this was a, you know, some-

thing that was totally part and parcel of killing or invasions|

or anything of that kind. Put in that context, I just don't
remember that any of these’ operations were ever mounted

let alone had any prospects.of:suc¢ess. That a lot of them wel
discussed, I haven't the slightest doubt. and I don't know
what other people in the Government have testified to but
even that must have come up at various meetings as to whether
this was a viable way to get ria of the man.

Q Well, my particular questions now pertain to the
election of 1970.

A May I say that I have absolutely no objection to
your going into the Agency records. There are a lot of people
around here who renenber what was done in 1970. 1962 and

1961, et cetera, people have died, but whatever those fellows

that ran the W.H. Division and were Chief of Station in

RAVdGIT GUOI “U GIvaaS HL Nowa AdODOLOHG

Chile and all the rest, I have got no reason to cavil with
them. They are honest men and will tell the truth about it.

I encouraged Senator Church to do it. They have gone over

so much about it. But the facts are ascertainable.

Q Let.me try to establish this, if you have any
recollection on it, that prior to the election on or about
September 4, 1970, the Agency did spend a considerable amount
of funds in coordination with the. State. Department for
propaganda efforts to convince or to show the people of Chile
the dangers of a Marxist regime. Do you remember that?

A Yes. I have no doubt that money. was. spent. I
think it was just for those purposes, as I recall it.

Q And after the election, but before the investiture
by the legislature, there were the authorization of additional

funds to be spent to prevent the accession of Allende to the.’

presidency by seeking to induce various Chilean groups and

possibly the military to thwart the investiture. Do you

was that efforts.were made to find out if there was .any way
to do it but I don't recall that anybody found any way to do
it and that, therefore, the whole thing was dropped. There
may have been some, you know, minor additional expenditures
made but I don't recall anybody approving of a specific
plan to stop the investiture. i

Q You mentioned that the Attorney General, Robert

you dated October 16, 1962, pertaining to this, and I wonder
if you would read this memorandum and see if it refreshes

Q The Cuban missile crisis, I believe, was in October
of 1962. ‘

A Colonel Patcheil.. I had forgotten all about him.

Q This letterhas been marked Helms' Exhibit 5.

A That sort of lays it out, doesn't it?

Q Ambassador Helms, having read the Helms' Exhibit
No. 5, this is a memorandum which you prepared which appears
to have been prepared on October 16, 1962, the date that you
met with the Attorney General, is that correct?

A yes.

Q And to the best of your recollection, did the
Attorney General express the general dissatisfaction of the
President with the Operation Mongoose?

A I have every reason.to believe that what I wrote
in that memorandum was the best of my recollection of what :
was said and what went on in the meeting described.

ever happened about anything.
