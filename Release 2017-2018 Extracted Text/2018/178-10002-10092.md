with the Agency of the development or discussions of any plans

concerning the possible assassination of Patrice Lumumba?

A.

I don't recall anything about any plans to assassinate

Patiice Lumumba. I know that Lumumba was a controversial figure

at the time.. I know whatever year this was - was in the

Eisenhower or the Kennedy era that Lumumba was riding high.

I believe that the era would have been in the era of

1959, '60. I believe he was killed in early '61.

I remember later hearing all kinds of allegations

about Lumumba and how

he had been killed and why he had been

killed. I remember also the fact that the -- it was abundantly

clear that the Agency had had nothing to do with his demise

but whether there was a plot on the Agency at sometime or

another to try to bring about his demise I was not familiar with

TOT

ito I want to say here I will obviously do the very best i

can with my recollection but when you consider how much has been

ATT

in the newspapers about a number of things in the last period osta

years it is pretty hard to stick in time when you first heard

about something.

All I am trying to convey here is I was not as far as I

know privy to any ongoing plan to get rid of Patrice Lumumba

by assassination.

Now, the dictator of the Dominican Republic, Mr.

Trujillo, was killed on or about May 30, '61. Prior to that

time were you aware of the fact that there had been a request

made of the Agency to deliver guns to dissidents in the

Dominican Republic?

A.

I don't believe I was familiar with it at the time

although I can't say. I

certainly heard about the gun business

later because I had occasion to go back when President Johnson

asked me about this episode at one time to look into the records

to find out about Trujillo. I could find no evidence that the

Agency had been responsible for his demise but I did find

evidence at the time that there was an opposition group in the

United: States Government was anxious to have the Agency support

and assist and I think I may very well have known about the

opposition group at the time.

I have no recollection any longer that I was privy to the

sending of any guns forto the Dominican Republic and if I was,

I don't recall they were ever identified as being designed to

kill Mr. Trujillo. I know there was a desire on the part of

whatever Administration was in power then, they didn't like Mr.

Trujillo. They like Mr. Duvalier and certain others but I was

aware of no attempts to bring about his death through Agency

assets.

I think since you have raised this question of an assassi-

nation I would like to say something as a generality here.

Dearly in the game when Colonel Galloway was my boss in

what was then known as the Office of Special Operations, I don't

even recall any more in what connection this came up but he said

to me one day that the Agency should certainly have the

capability to get rid of foreigners when required and that this

had to be done secretly and you should never ask your boss

for

permission to do these things, and so forth. I remember at the

time arguing with him about this and saying that I though that

there was no possibility whatever that the United States Govern-

ment could develop a capacity to kill people because you could

never keep it a secret. Sooner of later, maybe after five years

ten years, Lord knows what, someone would come in of write some

Congressman and say the Agency was responsible for killing so

and so and aside from the morlity of

it I felt it was impracti-

cal for the US Government to do something like that at this time

I felt that way all the time I was Director.. I never in my

towards killing, murder, assassination of anybody of whom I am

aware, and so I can only tell you that as the years have gone

by, as I say, quite aside from moral asepcts of this thing,

the Improbability of

ever being able to do anything like that as

an American Government agency has become less and less viable.

In fact, I have often said to associates that there are

three things that the American people would never stand for.

One is assassination, two is rape, and three is dealing in

drugs. So that I

didn't want anybody in the Agency thinking

that any of those things were going to be satisfactory to me.

Mr. Manfredi asked you about some notes in which there

was the mention of three handwritten names by you. One was

Allende's investiture by the Chilean legislature. Do you:

remember' that call?

A.

No.

Or contact?

A.

I knew this subject had come up but I thought it came

up in the context of the 40 Committee deliberations. I don't

recall a conversation with President Nixon. I don't say I never

had one. I just don't recall it in that form.

Q.

Do you recall any request made by the President or

anyone else in the White House that the Agency funnel funds and

also even perahps

submachine guns to see if something could be

done

to prevent the

legislature from electing him?

A.

Well, certainly they wanted the legislature not to

elect President Allende. The Nixon Administration certainly

didn't want that. My recollection of the circumstance, though,

at the time was that having investigated this, we came to the

conclusion there was no way to prevent his investiture. And

I do not recall anything about machine guns.

Or guns of any kind?

A.

I don't recall anything about guns. I recall a desire

to bribe, see if it was possible to bribe enough representatives

who were going to participate in the election. That was a non

available affair. There was no entity in Chile that showed the

slightest interest in upsetting the Government or the results

of the election and, although there was a great deal of

pressure to do something about it, I don't recall our finding

any way that we could have done it.

l Do you recall that there was a specific direction

from the President that you not advise the Secretary of

State of this request from the White House?. Do you ever

recall that being done?

A No, I don't recall his saying it in this connection

but, MI. Belin, let me just say that this was a

favorite

device of President Nixon, Don't tell so and so. Be sure

you keep this secret. So I am not questioning the fact that

he might very well have said it. On the other hand, I don't

recall it in this connection.

In what connection do you recall his telling you

not to tell the Secretary of State about it?

A

Oh, I think these were things having to do with

Vietnam and Southeast Asia,as best I recall.

O Do you recall his ever telling you not to tell any-

thing about this particular subject involving Chile to

the Forty Committee?

A

No. I don't remember that.

I assume that if the President would have told you

not to tell the Secretary of State, you would have followed;

the direction of the President.

I won't challenge it but the President's Foreign Advisory

No. I don't want to identify myself with that

statement because they had

their own way that they thought

they were doing their job and I assume they thought they

were doing it and I never regarded them as an oversight

organization.

Well, if the President would have told you to

refrain from commenting about a subject to the Foreign .

Intelligence Advisory Board --

A I would have found no strain with that at all.

And if he would have told you not to tell a

particular thing to a Congressional oversight committee,

how would you --

A: I don't know. I might have argued with him about

that depending upon what it was, because there you have

a different kind of a situation. After all, the President is

the boss. of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. He

appoints it and they are his creatures, and so is the

Secretary of State, and so are his assistants in the White

House. After all, under our system of Government the President

rides supreme over the Executive Branch, so if he tells

somebody there not to tell somebody else he has got every

right, I assume, to do so.

With a Congressional committee you are under a different!

situation because there you have a coordinate branch of the

Government where his writ does not obtain, necessarily.

And so what you are saying is to the extent that

there is a Legislative Branch of the Government, that would

basically depend upon what the particular request of the

President was?

Yes, and I think if I thought he was asking me to

deprive them of something they had a right to have, I would

certainly have an argument with him about it because after

all, I have to live with both, or a Director has to live with

both.

And hypothetically if you argue with him and you do?

being my boss, but I mean, I wouldn't feel very happy about

Ambassador Helms. When approximately did you first become

Well, when you put it this way, I am not sure what

you are referring to because during the years of the Kennedy

Administration, there was a flat-out effort ordered by

the White House, the President, Bobby Kennedy who was after'

all his man, his right hand in these matters, to unseat the

Castro government, to do everything possible to get rid of

it by whatever device could be found and thati was the

reason for mounting this large operation in Miami to work

on this very problem. And the Bay of Pigs was a part of this

effort and after the Bay of Pigs failed, there was even a..

greater push to try to get rid of this Communist influence 90

miles from the United States shores:

The business about the assassination of Castro, I have

read about this in the papers. I'have heard about it from

associates. It has been kicked around whether this was a

viable proposition or not. I have no doubt it was written

into various plans as one of many options but I don't recall

any successful effort that was made in this direction and

since Castro is alive and apparently well in Havana, the

extent to which this was serious!! have never ascertained.

Do you recall

the fact that poison pills were

developed to be delivered to assets or to people in Cuba for

possible insertion in food or drink to be eaten by

Castro?

A

Were poison pills taken to Cuba? I never knew any-

thing about this. I don't recall ever having heard anything

about poison pills or any of that. What I want to say in this

connection is the fact that I never heard about this doesn't

mean that there were ma-y, many ideas discussed in the Agency"

about what to do with the Cuban Government but I don't

recall anything. like poison pills.

Whose idea was this? Do you have the information?

Well -

I recall somebody discussing with me one day an

even crazier idea which had to do with some kind of a thing

that might be planted on the beach where Castro walked in the

morning and it would blow up when he put his foot on it, or

something. There were more nutty ideas. It reminded me of

the time of OSS when somebody wanted to get propaganda into

Germany and they discovered there was a herd of cows that

grazed in Germany and were milked in France, so

they devised

some suppositories into which there were put a lot of

propaganda leaflets and those were put in the cows on the

theory they were being left on the German side of

the border

when the cows

were grazing and nobody would be the wiser.

So to say there are nutty ideas cooked up in organizations

like this is to tell

the truth.

Is there any evidence, may I ask, Mr. Belin, is

there any evidence in the record that any Director authorized

what I can only refer to by

the dictionary definition of

an assassination of a foreign leader?

Well, there is evidence in the

record, Ambassador

Helms, that there were plans made to try and assassinate

Premier Castro of Cuba, that there were several series of

plans, and that the plans at at least one or two of the

which did not start, I believe, in the DDP area. It started

in the Office of Security, if I recollect, to what

-- somebody made a decision that it would be advisable to

brief Robert Kennedy as the Attorney General about the

existence of Roselli and various things that the Agency had

had to do with him and I believe that -- this I have been

told -- I have had my memory refreshed on this. I don't

want to mislead you. I have been told that it was Edwards

and Houston who went down to brief the Attorney General.

I am not 100 percent certain about that any more. But I

know there was a memorandum for the record made at the time

because I have had reason to review it.

I don't recall. It may have been Houston, may have

reviewed it when there was a story in the Chicago - one

of the Chicago newspapers some years ago about this whole

Roselli business, that I asked for the records and looked at

them at that

time.

can. You can call this, if you would Helms' Exhibit 1.

story from the Chicago Sun Times under date of August 16,

1963, headlines "CIA Sought Giancana. Help for Cuba Spying."

I want you to examine this and see if perhaps that

is

what you had reference to in reference to the Chicago

stories.

It could very easily be. It looks just like what

I recall came out at the time and I think somehow or other

this name Sandy Smith sticks in my mind as being the writer y

of the article in geustion. So I have no reason to doubt that*

this is the article we are talking about.

Handing you what has been marked Helms. Exhibit

you, also under date of August 16, 1963, I think that might

background of those, Ambassador Helms?

A, Well, I don't understand what you mean by a

refreshed recollection. I mean, at the time I was told that

Roselli was trying to get into Cuba. Whether I was told that

this was an assassination plot, for which $150,000 was being

projected, and so forth, I don't recall any more but I wasn't

involved in the activity at the time and when I had to go

back into the files to get this thing, you will see there that

I had to call Colonel Edwards to find out if there was any

records of this, and so forth, so it was something in which I

hadn't been involved and I obviously in recent years have

To try and assassinate Fidel Castro.

I don't recall ever any -- I mean, I recall a great

many activities of Harvey but I don't recall an effort

to assassinate Castro as put that way. I mean, the dictionary

definition. I am telling you they were trying to unseat his

entire government, so the fact that they were trying to get

rid of him is no argument but I don't recall any specific plan

or proposal that was approved to assassinate Castro.

Do you remember any authorization on your part

for William Harvey to handle this on a special basis?

A Oh, I certainly remember the discussions with him

about Roselli and his Mafia types and the fact they were

going to have to be handled on a special basis but I don't

recall any special basis being used to try to get them to

do an assassination.

@ Do you remember that sometime in April of 1962 Sheffle:

Edwards obtained your approval to have William Harvey get

in touch with Roselli?

A.

Well, that may be.

Do you remember?

A

Because I certainly know at some point Harvey

took over Roselli. I don't remember at what time but I know

he took him over and for a long time handled him thereafter

around our necks for a very long time indeed. I

don't know when it finally ended but it seems to me it

was some years.

Do you remember any discussions with William Harvey

in which one of the things agreed upon was that the DCI,,

Mr. McCone, would not be briefed about this?

No, I don't

recall any conversations with Harvey

or anybody else that Mr.McCone shouldn't be briefed. I don't

say they didn't take place. I just don't have any recollection

of it. I can't think today why I would have not wanted him

briefed about something. I mean, after all, one of the bases

on which this Agency has always operated was that the Director

was privy to know anything that went on. That was established

early in the game.

Well, the Director --

A Is there some evidence that I said no, don't tell

the Director, or he shouldn't be briefed?

well, there has been testimony and there is documen-

tation that it was agreed between you and Mr. Harvey not

to brief the DCI and I wonder whether of not you have any

recollection, No. I, of whether of not that discussion was

had and if you do have any such recollection, as to why that

discussion might have been had.

No. I don't have any recollection of the discussion.

any viable plans that were ever brought to light to do this

possibilities of killing various people in connection with, you

plans that were approved or that were viable specifically

directed at eliminating Castro, but that there were conver-

Would that be the Special Operations group?

problems all around the world - how are we going to organize

was

some organization that we used to report to regularly abou

all the time. Joe Califano was involved from the Army

Department in these matters. I don't know. There were other

for the whole effort to unseat the Castro government.

Is this the group that you are referring to?

No. Mongoose would have been an internal agency

thing, I think. Now,

maybe it was known downtown as - or

some of these people who were privy to these things in

other agencies that this was the rubric. I am not sure. It

may well be.

or Special Operations Group --

That sounds familiar, yes. That sounds familiar.

days than I do but honesly, I haven't even thought about them

in all these years.

Sir, do you have any recollection as to who might

have been the driving forces from the White House in efforts

to do something about Castro?

A Well, the principal driving force was the Attorney

General, Robert Kennedy. There isn't any question about this.

Involved in this was a group of individuals who were sort of

hired and pulled together by Kennedy and Rusk and McNamara

and McGeorge Bundy and all those people to get on with this

job and as

I sit here and start to think about this,

Califano was one of them. It seems to me Lansdale, who had

been successful in this kind of operation out in the Far

East was brought in for a while. There was a small office.

of this is coming back to me now.

Well, as it comes back to you, do you remember any

of these

them in Cuba, to bring down this government or to kill

anybody that they could lay their hands on. This was a

pretty fulsome but when you come down to this question of a

actually was ever carried out. I think that there was a lot

of lying on the part of those Cubans and a lot of backing and

forthing with allegations of things that happened that never

did happen and as I look back on the whole period, with

all the effort that was made in money and manpower, and

so forth, devoted to try and unseat the Castro government,

when one looks back at it it was a pretty pitiful effort

and I think a great deal of it was just, what shall I say,

talking a good game.

l Now, do you have any recollection of any briefing

of McCone about any Agency plans in which Harvey or Roselli

or Sheffield Edwards may have been involved other than

Exhibit 4?

A:

I don't have any recollection of that, Mr. Belin.

I want to tell you that all I recall was that McCone was

constantly asking about how we were getting along with the

Cuban operations and McCone was constantly being briefed about

what we were trying to do about these operations but what

was in all those briefings I have no recollection any more

at all and no matter how I would work on this I would never

be able to sort it all out. It was -- a lot of effort was

being made, all kinds of things to get boats and to train

Cubans to man those boats and land on secret shores and all.

kinds of things.

May I ask a

question at this juncture? Since Castro

is alive and well in Cuba, what is the problem about these

-- trying to verify all this business about whether these

attempts were made or not made? I mean, does it make any

difference any more?

well, there are two major areas of concern apart

from whether or not assassination should play any part in

American policy. One area concerns how the plans were

authorized, whether they were directed externally of whether

they grewup internally.

The second area concerns what I would call internal moni-

toring and control. If Mr. McCone didn't know about it, other

than that briefing, that poses a problem so far as an Agency

operating under control. If you did not know about it until

the spring of 1962, and the information that I have gathered

indicates that you were. not privy to any information about

this until the spring of 1962, you were in a fairly important

position in the Agency and yet were not aware of what could

have been a potentially disastrous operation,, certainly an

operation that had all kinds of ramifications

for this,

country when one considers the trigger of World War I involved

an assassination attempt.

And so, therefore, the scope of my inquiry is not

necessarily to say it is this person's responsibility but in

large part it is to determine how these plans got organized

and how they were kept under control, and I should tell you

that it is my information that, although you did not have any

information about this prior to the spring of 1962, that

in the spring of 1962 you were made privy to what I am going to

call Phase I which was the Giancana phase and also what I am

going to call Phase II when William Harvey took over the

operation, and that MI. McCone, according to the records that

I have seen, was not briefed until the August 16, 1963

memorandum, in part because of the fact Mr.McCone had not

been DCI at the time the plans were undertaken, so the

documents say that I have seen, and that at the time of his

briefing in August of 1963, it was not an oral briefing. but

rather limited to a discussion of the Giancana matter in

the memorandum for the record addressed to Senator Kennedy,

Exhibit 4.

Now, is there anything that. I have said which disagrees

with anything that is to the best of your recollection?

A I have no reason to cavil with what you say. I

don't have any contrary recollections but I don't remember a

lot of this either. So --

Q: Now, do you remember Senator Kennedy coming over

to the Agency on or about March 8, 1967, to review this

memorandum for the records that was Helms' Exhibit 4 that

pertained to his 1962 briefing?

Senator Kennedy visited the Agency to do that?

reason to argue with it. It would not have loomed large in

Do you have any recollection of a project known

as Project Amlash?

A Amlash? By that name, not any more.

Q Did you ever?

A. Don't forget, Mr. Belin, that there were hundreds

of these things.

@ Do you have any recollection of any man by the

name of Rolando Cubela who was a Cuban who at one time had

been associated with Castro and then became disaffected

with him?

A Let's see. Was he the fellow who eventually ended

up in Paris or Madrid or something of this kind?

Yes. At one time he did and then eventually

he ended up in Cuba but he was met by Agency people in Paris.

What was his

particular cryptonym?

Well, among other things, some Black Leaf 40 had

been developed to be delivered to him in a pen which had been

constructed to have a hypodermic needle with the object to

inject the Black Leaf 40 into. Castro. And that was delivered

to him. in Paris on November 22, 1963. Do you remember?

A

I certainly remember Cubela., I certainly remember

the fact that he was, I think -- was he a defector from the

Cuban regime.

discussing whether that would be aviable operation or not.

were a lot of things: that were discussed and I am sure they

Do you remember that eventually arms were delivered

to Mr. Cubela in Cuba?

A I don't have any doubt about it. I think

we

delivered arms all over the place in connection with Cuba.

Administration wasn't dead serious about getting rid of the

Castro government. I mean,. let's not -- this was a

Government operation and if Dean Rusk of anybody, MaGeorge

Bundy or anybody else is sitting around, no, no, no, we

didn't have this in mind at all; let's get that all straightened

out. They wanted to get rid of Castro. Well, let me say

that I don't know that Dean Rusk wanted to get rid of him

but certainly President Kennedy wanted to get rid of him.

What do you mean by getting rid of him?

They wanted to unseat his government. They wanted to

bring his government down by whatever device could be found.

Q: Which could include assassination?

A I don't know that the word assassination was ever

used but certainly if you land armed men on a beach and the

effort is to recruit other armed men and to try to start a

whole arrangement whereby you, you know, you bring down a

government, sombeody is bound to get shot. But the thing

that I am doing my level best with you about and which even

as I sit here thinking about it, is the focus on this

assassination business as though this was a, you

know, some

thing that was totally part and parcel of killing or invasions

of anything of that kind. Put in that context, I just don't

remember that any of these operations were ever mounted

let alone had any prospects: of success. That a lot of them wer

discussed, I haven't the slightest doubt and I don't know

what other people in the Government have testified to but

even that must have come up at various meetings as to whether

this was a viable way to get rid of the man.

There is a very great difference, it seems to me,

when you actually approved it, were prepared to take the

responsibility.

For the record, there appear to have been no plans.:

undertaken to carry out either the seashell or the skin-diving

suit but there do appear to be plans to deliver the poison

do you?

A

No, I don't.

I want to get back to Chile, if I can.

Now, what years are we in now?

We are now in 1970.

Because one of the problems about Cuba and

testimony I have made in Congress is that there were two

operations in Cuba, one in -- I mean in Chile. Excuse me.

Chile. Not Cuba. Chile. One in 1964 and then a different

kind of a thing in 1970, and one of the reasons that my

credibility was questioned was that I answered rather narrowly

a coupde of questions that Senator Symington asked me because.

I assumed and I had reason to believe that he knew that

in 1964 we had funded actual candidates in the Chilean

election. In other words, we had given money to the candidates

themselves, not money to civic action groups or things of

this kind.

Well, my particular questions now pertain to the

election of 1970.

A May I say that I have absolutely no objection to

your going into the Agency records. There are a lot of people

around here who remember what was done in 1970. 1962 and

1961, et cetera, people have died, but whatever those fellows

that ran the W.H. Division and were Chief of Station in

Chile and all the rest, I have got no reason to cavil with

PHOTOCOPY

them. They are honest men and will tell the truth about it.

I encouraged Senator Church to do it. They have gone over

this with me over and over and over again and I remember only

so much about it. But the facts are ascertainable.

GERALD

Let me try to establish this, if you have any

recollection on it, that prior to the election on or about

September 4, 1970, the Agency did spend a considerable amount

of funds in coordination with the. State Department for..

propaganda efforts to convince or to show the people of Chile

the dangers of a Marxist regime. Do you remember that?

Yes. I have no doubt that money. was spent. I

think it was just for those purposes, as I recall it.

And after the election, but before the investiture

by the legislature, there were the authorization of

additional

funds to be spent to prevent the accession of Allende to the:

presidency by seeking to induce various Chilean groups and

possibly the military to thwart the investiture. Do you

was that efforts were made to find out if there was any way

to do it but I don't recall that anybody found any

way to do

it and that, therefore, the whole thing was dropped. There

may have been some, you know, minor additional expenditures

made but I don't recall anybody approving of a specific

plan to stop the investiture.

Q And you don't have any recollection of the providing

of any submachineguns to any military officers?

Well, let me show you from your files a memorandum

of a meeting on September 15, 1970.

Who were present at that meeting besides you and

the President, according to your memo?

According to the memo it says present were John

Mitchell and Henry Kissinger. Let's see what these notes

say. As I interpret these notes, this was an injunction to

me to do everything possible to stop it. But I don't recall

that we were able to find any way to do it.

• And how much funds were authorized to be spent?

A Well, it says here "$10 million is available, more

if nedessary."

A

Then, what does it say?

"Full-time job. Best men we have." In other words,

this was a Nixon injunction to pull out all the stops to do

this.

@ But you don't have any specific recollection. of

his direction to you not to tell the Forty Committee or

the Secretary of State?

No, I don't.

All right.

You mentioned that the Attorney General, Robert

there appears to be a corroborating memorandum prepared by

you dated October 16, 1962, pertaining to this, and I wonder

if you would read this memorandum and see if it refreshes

your recollection.

A

6 October 1962. When was the Cuban missile crisis?

The Cuban missile crisis, I believe, was in October

of 1962.

Colonel Patchell. I had forgotten all about him.

This letterhas been marked Helms' Exhibit 5.

A

That sort of lays it out, doesn't it?

Ambassador Helms, having read the Helms' Exhibit

No. 5, this is a memorandum which you prepared which appears

to have been prepared on October 16, 1962, the date that you

met with the Attorney General, is that correct?

A

Yes.

And to the best of your recollection, did the

Attorney General express the general dissatisfaction of the

President with the Operation Mongoose?

A

I have every reason

to believe that what I wrote

in that memorandum was the best of my recollection of what

was said and what went on in the meeting described.

Would it be fair to say that the Attorney General

Yes.

Q. Do you know whether or not at any time the Attorney

General was ever advised of the fact that William Harvey

had overtaken or had taken over a certain portion of the

Roselli operation?

A

I don't have any recollection of that. Have

you ever talked to Harvey, incidentally?

Yes, sir.

What did he have to say on the subject?

Well, Mr. Harvey never met with the Attorney General

but Mr.Harvey did say that he --

He never saw the Attorney General?.

He never discussed - no, he didn't say that.

Oh.

He never discussed the particular plans in which he

was personally involved with the Attorney General.

A

I see. I see.

He did say that sometime in the spring of 1962

you became aware of those plans and that would be corroborated

by other documentation that I have seen, and that he also

said that you and he determined not to brief the DCI on it

at the time and that is also corroborated by other documenta-

tion that I have seen.

point.

Surely.

A

This plan that Harvey was alleged to have, how

far did it ever get? I mean, what I am trying to get at

here is that we are dealing with a lot of conjecture, a lot

of thoughts, a lot of ideas. Now, did any plan get down to the

point where somebody was about to get in a boat or airplane

and go to. Cuba and do X or Y and it shows I approved this

happening or was this

something he was going to try to develop

and see if it could fly and if there was any possibility

that it might work, and so forth?

I. There are reports that the people with whom there

was contact did get to Cuba with pills and with --

And also the second phase and in addition, there

were subsequent reports that there were arms provided

also and what you are saying is if this plan continued over

a period of several years it continued without your express

overview,as I understand your testimony, is that correct?

Yes. My recollection of Harvey's dealings with

Roselli or during most of the period that was that nothing

ever happened about anything.

Well, certainly Mr. Castro is still living.

Yes, but I mean, I think this -- I don't know whose
