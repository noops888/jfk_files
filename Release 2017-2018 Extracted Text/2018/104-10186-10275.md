He was a captain in the army during BATISTA’s time

and was in prison for his party in the 4 April Movement
until his release by CASTRO. FERNANDEZ was not known

to be a Communist and, at the time of this report (1962),
was not considered to be one. He attended artillery
schools ‘in the United States (dates and places unknown) and
speaks English-well. He is well educated and well

trained for the- position he holds. He +s often referred
to as "El Gallego Fernandez." FERNANDEZ allegedly

aS Chief of the operation against the invaders of
Playa.Giron in April 1961. He was described as having
been born about 1921, being six feet one inch tall,

185 pounds, ‘having light grayish eyes, light brown

hair, a fair complexion, white even teeth, and an oval
face. He speaks with a Castillian accent.

A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 17 July 1962,
Stated that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ was the Chief of the
Seccion Preparacion y Organizacion Combativa (Section for
the Preparation and Organization of Warfare - SPOC), the :

military brains of the country. He had access to all secret
information, FERNANDEZ received his instructions exclusively
from Fidel and Raul CASTRO with whom he is in personal contact.
He received his military education in the United States. He is
intelligent and reportedly not a Communist.

A Cuban national, untested, reported in September 1962, that
the facilities of the Military Academy at Camp Managua were
being utilized as a training center for officers, officer~
candidates and non-commissioned officers. Major Jose FERNANDEZ,
aka "El Gallego,” has an office on the ground floor of the first
building as you enter the camp. FERNANDEZ and a General Enrique
LISTER prepared all the training schedules, pumphlets, and
training aides, as well as Joint exercises in which air ground

(armor and infantry) have participated.

In a 14 November 1962 report, an untested source said that
Comandante ‘(fnu) FERNANDEZ is the only Cuban official who
is completely within the confidence of the Soviets with

respect to the military fortifications of the Habana area,

A in a report dated 18 May 1963,
stated that an unidentificd “usually reliable source" said
that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ, known as "El Gallego," is

Soviet Union in February 1963. FERNANDEZ arrived in Habana
from Moscow two days before CASTRO's surprise departure.

A fairly reliable source, in a report dated 7 August 1963,
stated that she die aot think FERNANDEZ vas a Communist as. he
has always had Catholic tendencies but that he is a correct
soldier and puts the military above everything. He is divorced
and hts ex-wife is jiving in Miami with their two daughters,

- Francis, born in 195i, and Alicia, born in 1955. ,

A source who is a high ranking Cuban ailitary officer who has
good contacts amotg Cuban officials (he has not submitted many
Teports, but they appear to have been accurate) reported in
September 1963 that Kajot Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ Alvarez, Chief
of Training, General'Staff of the Cuban Rebel Army, is anti-
Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the
word. He sticks to bis military duties and scrupulously.
avoids politics; he keeps himself completely isolated fom
all political elements. He is proud of his present status
and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears uAwilling to undertake any kind of activity against
the CASTRO regime. CASTRO is undoubtedly knowledgeable of

FERNANDEZ" attitude and has sufficient confidence in him to

retain him in his present position. CASTRO also is aware !
that he has few officers with the military discipbine,

know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
