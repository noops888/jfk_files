From Non 1960 to March 1961- Varona was paid directly in cash by Hunt.

April and May 1961 paid by Bender check from Headquarters. Payments

in addition to salary received from the FRD.

"AS of 3 July 1961, I was of the opinion that me should not pay Varona any-

thing more under the table, but in view of the Special Group decision,

I am correctly informed, of encouraging our dealings with numerous

Cuban groups and personalities, it might be wise to keep in touch with

Tarona for some time and pay him some reasonable amount as nothine

cements friendships better than money.!

Routing slip datedd 10 July contains remark that we should hold off

on any further payments until the air clears and until we get instructions.

Right now Varona is one of our most bitter critics. I don't propose to buy
