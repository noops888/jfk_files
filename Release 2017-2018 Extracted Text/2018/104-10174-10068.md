themselves into action, but nonethtless potots of real concern
to him, Then, he cane to: Mexico for # period to act "that" novel
ond writing off his chest: during. that period, he saw the :
Mexican system anu someot the satin American §

At thet
juncture, he became very much aware lof the fact thee it was the
"system" that counted, In spite of whatever Imgerfeetions existed,
and that there "was, ond is, nothin Bere nearly
approach the U.S, system". As he re are a lot
of things wrong, because of decistons mode by'h ‘washe ings: who
are fallible and have their own interests to lock after, but
there Is so much good and so many ‘compensations on the plus side
of the system and the way it works, you can afford ta resegnl.ze .
the wrongs and work them out withia the, system". He sald that
this was’ so’ obvious, from abroad that he just wondered why he
ever had worrled about Incidents and dich't teal that it
was the "system" that mattered, |

had had with

b. He told about some of the discussions 1
leftist Mexican intellectuals on these points such Is the
Soviet system capable of producing and absorbing such vietures
as ‘Or. Strangelove! or having a Je write a ‘Grapes
of Wrath! and run off with all pri if the writing and tion
Aleture Fleld? Can you even app té that In Mexico? Witness
the furore over 'The Children af Sanchez! here while the ‘Grapes

of Wrath’. was every bit as harsh with respect to similar
circumstances fn the U.S. and won everything." On and on, In

so many words, our systom thrives on "self-ceitletsa", and

there are things to criticize, but what other system in this world
is not only permissive: of that, but thrives on it. And so on,

He has no doubts about. any governmental /social /political /economic
system In any combInatton being able to even approach it.

3. The foregoing is a very brief synopsis of a rambling and
long philusophic discussion on these points in which TICHBORN
concluded his statement -and, even, tirade (his Latin heritage
had gotten the better of him at thet point) with the statement
that "My philosophy on this potnt, and my present sentiments,
have been forged in the fire of thinkIng as a leftist erftic -
and having come ta see and -undefstand a great deal; and they,
can't tell me a damn thing about what is the best system nor.on
the basts-of their present circumstances in their ov: countries
have they any right or basis for. criticizing the U.S.-and its
actions. Nothing Is perfrect, and | can't defend it as betng
perfect, but for every imperfection they try to show me in the
U.S. and what It has or has not done, | can show them hundreds
in thelr country and any other one they try to hold up as a model,"

4. In so many words, at least the Station case officer at
the present time is satisfled in his oun mind that TICHSORN was
speaking sincerely during this discussion and there is no question
in the 3taticn's mind about where TICHBORN stands ideatogtcally
even though he may be considered “left of center."
antly In the back-

Reference: | DIR.67851

Action Required: FYE

1, Forwerded herewith -ia the referenced amendment
Edward G. TICHBORE's contract which provides for a one year
exténsion @ffective 19 November 1964 and a compensation
increase from $9,000 to $12,006. |

2. During Subject's recent TOY.in Washington it was

made clear to him that this substantial pay raise and extension

of his contract. was on the basis that’ TICLUBORN continue to

devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity, In view of

the fact that Subject 1y currently handling only one

project for the Station,. please expléin to him that in the event

that his work load reverts to the 50. to. (65h, level, he cannot

expect. to continue to'recéive thé present ‘amount of ‘compensation,

During Subject's talks at Headquarters, it appeared that

TICHBORN understands this most clearly. As a contract agent,

he ig refi\vferated on the basis of services rendered, In return
“for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on incone

he might receive from his private business activities. “Obviously

it is our hope that coupled with the occasional full-time

assignments in other WH countries levied on TICHBORN, that the
‘Station will. be able to continue to utilize Subject 's services

at the high level of activity which will justify his current

_ compensation,

REFERENCE :~:HMMA=263525 dated” 22 September“196'

1: ‘Ad“probably canbe. discerned fron previoiia’ cotiminicuttons on thia subject,
the Station has never been too cértsin: about the original understandings with
Subject on his relationship with KUBARK. At least some understandings have been

Supplementary. to ‘the formal contract. {such aay vailability: for ‘extended-'..
trips This is no complatat on

the a OF the Station, but merely « prelude toa matter which the St.
brought ‘up with TICHBORN in connection with his|

QRMINE activities,

2. Ye has been the Station's inference, from talking to TICHBORN as well as
comzinications on other aspects of his relationship with KUBARK got covered

in his contract, that he is not to be con; * ent.
oi.j18 other yords, he has outside activitiés| here. en
ie was understood would provide additional Incowe to him at the time he

entered into his original relationship with KUBARK. As can be discerned from
his biographic data, he has operated ata level and enjoyed an income outlook
that vould not be satisfied by the present contractual arrangements on salary.
It has becom: obvious to the Station, however, that if he is to handle, properly,

“ CONTINUATION OF j
DISPATCH |

_3. ‘Taking all the foregoing into consideration and to avoid cenplications with
hie present projects or TICHBORN, the Station asked him what understanding he
had on the proportion of hts tim to be davoted to KUBARK activities, Ne said

Fr]. chat his presene contract was predicated on approximately 60 to s6-2/3% of
his time being utilized by KUBARK. Us present estimate is that he is devoting

i 85 to 90%-of hie time to KUBARK activities; and, if ke is to do the kind of job
thats desired on the projects recently acquired, ho will
sustain that percentage, OF coutoe, he continues to be available for appropriate
ignmenta {such as FUASPEN) in other countries from time
to tiwe; but, it ha e recogniaed that when he is absent

represents 00h “of his tim.

4. The Station agrees with his analysis on current commitments against his
Thorefora, it was indicated to TICHBORN that he
‘this matter with*Weadquarters:at: the time he:

makes his late October trip to PBPRIME
and chat the Station would request Headquarters to be

pe Tac
that his present contract extension expires 19 November 1964,

; 5. ‘The Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at ito
ieee initiative in order to try (a) to assure that demands being placed on TICHBORN
recently could be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) to yet o complete
understending on all aspects cf TICNBORN's contractual status (written and
unweitten) so that neither the Station wor TICHBORN get committed to these
continuing activities and suddenly find themselves in contentian about the
t4ne/salary-involved.>-It-shouldsalso.be emphasized that. TICHSORN has not...
complained, abotit recént requiremoats, but has devuted whatever tice required
to handle them aad do the Job expected, i

. “This contract

None of Tichtorn's travel claims have been processed since the
new contract has been effective. All travel claims submitted by
him, starting in June 1961 have been submitted on an actual expense
basis. .

Finance takes the view that the "This may include per diem---"
as restriéting Tichborn to per diem only plus of course operational
expenses. Processing Tichborns old accounts on this basis would .
require him to refund several hundred dollars.

‘An amiendment, to the contract would take care ef these old
accounts as submitted.

Options:

1. Get refund from Tichborn :
2. Amend contract to cover actual expenses’ to present
