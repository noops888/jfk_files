On 15 May, being a Saturday and two days prior to

loquacious mood for a luncheon engagement

with the statlon case officer.

:He showed little opposition to

In other words, there

• In the process,

TICHBORN brought out very sincerely,

harbored a number of "reservations" about the way that things

but nonethèless points of real concern

for a period to get

ond irleing off his chest: during that perind, he saw thi

Mexican system and some of the iatin American

that counted,

in spite of whatever imperfections existed,

and is, nothing

"jure, there are a lot

are fallible and have their oun interests to lock after,

there Is so much good and so many compensations on the plus side

of the system and

the way it works,

you can afford to recognize

the wrongs and work them out within the, system"

He said that

this wos so obvious from abinod thät he just rondered why he

over had worried about incidents and didn't realize that it

was the "system" that mattered.l

He told about some of the discussions he had had with

leftist Mexican intellectuals ei those

On and on.

to criticize, but what other system in this world

is not only permissive of that, but thrives on it.

•And so on.

about any governmental/social/political/economic

system in any combination being able to even approuch it.

The foregoing is a very brief synopsis of a rambling and

philusophic discussion on these points in which. TICHBORN

concluded his statement and, even,

tirade (his Latin heritage

gotten the better of him at that point) with the statement

"My philosophy on this point,

and my present sentiments,

have been forged in the fire of thinking as a leftist critic

and having come to see and understand a great deal, and they

can't tell me a damn thing

about what is the best system nor.on

4.

so many words

at least the Station case officer at

present time

is satisfled in his own mind that TiCHEORN was

speaking

sincerely during this discussion and there is no question

the

station's mind about where TICHBORN stands

ideologically

even though he may be considered "lert of center."

SInce this Issue seems to hover constantly in the back-

@ Contract Amendaent Edward G. TICHBORN

ACTION REQUIRED ROTRONCES

Reference: DIR 67851

Action

Required: MI

Forwerded berewith is the referenced amendment

Samard G. TICHEORNs contract which provides for a one year

extension effective 19 November 1964 and a compensation

increase from $0,000 to $12,000.

2.

During Subject's recent TDY. 1u Hashington it was

ande clenr to him that this substantial pay raise and extension

of his contract was on the basia that TICHORN continue to

devote 85 to 90% of his time to KUBARK activity,

In view of

the fact that Bubject iu currently handling only one

project for

the Station, please explein to him that in the event

that his work

load reverta to the 50 to 05% leyel, he cannot

expect to continue

to receive the present anount of compensation.

During Subject's talks at leaúguarters, It sippeared thnt

TICHBORN understands this most clearly.

As a contract agent,

he is refidorated on the basis of scrvices rendered.

for this arrangement, the government makes no claim on income

he might racelve from his privato bustness nctivities.

Obviously

it is our hope that coupled with the occasional full-time

assignments in other Wl countries levied on TICABORN, that the

Station will be able

to continue to utilize Subject's services

at the high level of activity which will Justify his current

compensation.

Dear Fr.. Thomes:

Due to ircreesed demande minon my time fron other clients,

I find it necessery to relinguish my duties

and I do so with great reluctence.

One of ny tieretofore-lesser

clients has recently expended his

activities in certain real estete developrents

thereby necessitating" freçuent absence

Then, too, I had underestimated

the enount

of tize and

effort required to satisfactorily attend the verdous

legs] and edzinistre,ive mattera

should you

so destre, I could recommend other legal counsel; but I re

inclined to feel thet the

principal problens would be

of an acministrative nature rather then a legal one.

Rey I theol you again for your confidance and food will in

hevine choser de

es legal counsel for your org-nization's activitias

I shall be happy to give you a personal report of ey

observationa on my next trip lo New York.

.1.: As.probably.can.be.discerned from.prevloud communications on thie subject,

the Station has never been too certain about the original understandings wich

Subject on his relationship wich KUBARK.

At least some understandings have been

supplemencary. Co.che formal contrast./such.as. hleavallábility for extended-

trips

Thie 18 no complaint on

the part of the Station, but merely a prelude to a natter which the Station

brought up wich TICHBORN in connection with his

QRMINE activities.

2.

It has been the Station's inference, from calking to TICHBORN as well as

comunications on other aspects of his

relationship with KUBARK not covered

in his contract, chat he 1a not to be considered a full-time contrace egent.

In ocher words.

Which iE

has outaide activities

shere.:rt

was understoud would provide additional income to him at the time he

entered into his original relocionship wich KUBARK. As can be discerned from

his biographic data, he has operated at a level and enjoyed an income outlook

that would

not be satisfied by the present contractual arrangenents on salary.

It has become obvious to the Stacion, however, that if he Is to handle, properly.

CONTINUATION OF

HAMA - 24353

.J.. Taking all the foregoing

into conaideration and to avoid complications wich

ho present projects or TICHBORN, the Station asked him what understanding he.

had op the proportion of his rue

to be dovoted to KUBARK activicles.

Ho snid

chat his present. contract was predicated on approximacely 60 to 66-3/38 of

his time being utilised by KUBARK. Hio present estimate is that he la devoting

85 to 90% of hia cine to KUBARK acilvities; and, if he la to do che kind of job

chạt la desired on che l

projects recencly acquired, he vill

suntein that percentago.

Of couroe, he continues to be available for appropriate

lassigamente

(such as FUASPEN) in other c

to sime; but, it has to be recognised that when be is absent

Chlo represents 100% of hia time.

* The Station agreco with his analysis on currere commitments against hia

tima on behalf of KUBARK.

Thorefore, lt was indicated to TICHEORN that he

should be prepared to take-up this matter with Headquarters at che time he:

nakes his late October trip to PBPRIME

and that the Station would request Headquartors to be

prepared to alacuss the matter de that time. It 1o the Stacion's underatanding

chat his present contract extension espires 19 November 1964.

The Station would like to emphasize that this matter was brought up at ita

Initiat ve in

order to try. (n) to assure that demands being placed on TICHBORN

recently could be reasonably expected to be fulfilled and (b) co get a complece

understanding on all aspects of TICHBORN's contractual status frition and

unwritter) so that neither the Scation nor TICHBORN get commicted to these

continuing actlvities and suddenly find themselves in contention about the

*he/salary Involved.-It should also-be emphasised chat TICHBORX 0a3, not

complained about recent requiremants, but has devoted whatever dice requirod

to handle then and do the job expected.

Tichborps original contract provided for travel on an actual.

expense, basis. This was when he was working on & dally or job

rate basis.

This contract was terminated and a new contract was written

lleu of subsistence."

None of Tichtorn's travel claims have been processed since the

new contract has been effective.

All travel claims submitted by

him starting in June 1961 have been sübmitted on an actual expense

basis.

Finance

takes the view that the "This may include per die--"

restricting Tichborn to per diem only plus of course

operational

expenses.

Processing Tichborns old accounts on this basis would.

require hin to refund several hundred dollars.

An amendment to the contract would take care of these old

accounts as submitted.

Options:

1.

2.

3:

Get refund from Tichborn

Ammend contract to cover actual expenses to present

date.

Amend contract to cover actual expenses past and

future.

What are your wishes?
