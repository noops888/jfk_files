The aforementioned informant advised that ROY VEY, another
supervisory official at the North Star Cement Block Co.,

is very annoyed about questions asked of him by Internal
Revenue Service Agents and is particularly annoyed with the
fact that his interviewers want a cost of living figure

from him and found it hard to believe that his mother loaned

The aforementioned information concerning possible illegal
activity on the part of LA ROCCA and the employees of the
North Star Cement Block Company has been disseminated to
the Internal Revenue Service at Pittsburgh, Pa.

convinced the alleged heart attack is a"phony.' According

to the informant, the same gamblers have stated that they
understand that "the boys from New Kensington" are interested
in buying the Phoenix Motel. He believes this reference
