where in CIA believed some of its activities may have exceeded of

its legal mandate.

Portions of this CIA document were

furnished this Bureau and referenced memorandum requested

documents pertaining to a particular Bureau division and/or

A review has been made of the material, supra, and

Pages 29, 30, under the heading "Merrimac," refer

handling of "several Agents" to covertly

monitor dissident groups in the Washington area and states

one was so successful the "Agent" was turned over to the FBI.

own sources "and through

liaison with the FBI." A reference is also made to primary

source of information being "sensitive intercepts produced

by NSA." While these pages do not directly compromise

Bureau operations, disclosure of NSA intercepts could well

indirectly adversely affect Bureau operations by disclosure

of sensitive techniques which

produce extremely valuable

information to the intelligence community, of which the FBI

is a part.

Pages 197, 198, refer to the response to an inquiry

as to involvement in domestic affairs by the Director, Central

Reference Service, CIA, and in no way compromises Bureau

operations.

Page 203 refers to a similar response by Director,

Foreign Broadcast Information Service, CIA, and includes

reference to their monitoring foreign

broadcasts of Jane

Fonda and Ramsey Clark and furnishing transcripts at the

request of the FBI and Department of Justice for consideration

for possible trial use. There is no compromise

of Bureau

operations involved as this was to be evidence in a public

trial and would have required CIA personnel to publicly

testify.

RE: SENSTUDY

The following are comments prepared by the Radio

Engineering Section of the FBI Laboratory and relate to copies of

excerpted pages from a report written by the Central Intelligence

Agency. Comments are keyed to page numbers which appear in

the lower right-hand corner of each sheet.

I. Page 00112

Paragraph b. refers to FBI purchases of television

equipment and is accurate as to equipment obtained. According to

Bureau records, Purchase Order #21100 was issued to CIA on

4/11/73 and was amended 9/24/73. The items were 1 each WTC-20

@ $18, 300 and 1 each WTC-23 @ $18,600. Purchase Order #21469

dated 5/1/73 was issued to CIA for 2 each lens systems totaling $1l, 200.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

2. Page 00118

Item 9 lists 50 "Actuators, Recorders." This entry is

partially correct.

Bureau records show that Purchase Order #8989 was

issued to CIA on 11/17/71 for 30 each QTC-lls at $488. 25, and 20 each

QTC-12As at $236. 25.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

Item 1l lists 1 "Camera, Video." This entry could refer to

that transaction detailed in Purchase Order #18301 issued to CIA on

11/27/72 for 1 each WTC-20 camera in the amount of $18, 400. Tubes

installed in these cameras were of the type mentioned under Item 12

and 13 below.

Item 12 lists 1 "Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance, Equivalent

of WL 30691. " This entry is accurate.

TOP SECRET

Purchase Order #16555 was issued to CIA on 9/21/72 in the

amount of $4, 639. The video tube was for use in a closed circuit

television camera.

Item 13 lists 2 "Tube, Image, WL 30691" as having been

furnished the FBI on 3/26/71 at a cost of $4, 607 each. This entry

is probably a duplication of Item 4 on page 0019. Bureau records

show that Purchase Order #5450 dated 5/21/71 was issued to CIA

for this equipment for use in CCTV cameras. No purchase order

to support two such acquisitions (March and May) could be located.

Item 14 lists 2 "Cameras, Television"' at a unit cost of

$18, 300. This entry probably refers to that equipment acquired under

Purchase Order #21100 and is detailed in Paragraph b. page 00112, above.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

3. Page 00119

Item 2 lists 25 "Actuators, Recorders." The entry is

accurate.

Purchase Order #17204 was issued to CIA on 10/18/72 for 25

each QIC-lls @ $591.94. This equipment is identical to that obtained on

Purchase Order #8989 mentioned above.

Item 3 lists "Tube, Image, Burn-Resistance" etc., and is a

duplication of Item 12 on page 00118. Note identical dates.

Item 4 lists "Tube, Image, WL 3069l" and is believed to refer

to the transaction carried as Item 13 on page 00118.

Items 5, 6, and 7 list "Transmitters, Module, Plug-In,

and Power Supply - UWP-39A. " These entries are essentially accurate.

Purchase Order #4203 was issued to CIA on 4/6/71 for

2 each transmitters SRT-67 @ $1372. 35; 1 each transmitter QRT-10A

@3160. 33; 1 each module QWT-18 @ $1247.40; and, 1 each power

supply UWP-39A @ $538. 65.

No damage would be suffered by release of this information.

Item (A) is believed to be accurate and in the absence of

additional detail no serious damage would be suffered by release of

this information.

Item (B) is accurate and as long as target is not specifically

identified no serious damage should be incurred. It should be recognized,

however, that although the concept of intercepting cryptographic

machine emanations would come as no surprise to those familiar with

| intelligence work, confirmation of a functioning system could encourage

implementation of countermeasures which would deprive the U.S. of

invaluable information.

Item (C) is accurate except that the equipment has not been

operated for some time. Without specific identification no serious

damage would result from disclosure of this information.

Item (D) is inaccurate to the extent that it states that

"installation is not fully operational because the full complement

of personnel have not yet arrived. " Aside from that, disclosure

of information could lead the knowledgeable foreign government to be

certain of Bureau's participation and take whatever diplomatic steps

they felt necessary. Decision to withhold is an operational/political

one rather than one which would affect technical capabilities and, therefore,

the Laboratory is making no recommendations in this regard.

5. Page 00222

Item (E) is accurate and entirely too revealing. If there

is any way this item can be deleted from material yet to be given to

anyone outside the intelligence community, it should be done. As

written, it suggests a concerted effort toward a penetration to be

attempted in the future. Disclosure of this information could easily

negate millions of dollars already spent and literally years of work

already performed - the largest single project ever undertaken by

this Bureau. In view of our responsibilities in the counter-intelligence

field, the FBI, as well as the intelligence community, and perhaps the

free world as well, would suffer incalculable harm from release of this

information. It would also be appropriate for the Intelligence Division

to comment on this item.

ARABIC LINGUISTS

(Item 6, pgs. 182 & 202)

With regard to press allegations concerning the use

of polygraph, it was noted that during July 1971 the President

was alleged to be furious with unauthorized disclosure of

classified information relative to the SALT Talks as disclosed

in the New York Times.

investigation to determine the source of the disclosure and

this was conducted under the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and

others of the White House Staff.

A subsequent article in the Washington Post dated

September 3, 1971 stated that a State Department spokesman

had acknowledged at a news briefing that agents of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation had polygraphed State Department

employees suspected of leaking information on the SALT Talks

in July. This statement is not accurate and the Director of

the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover) denied this allegation in a letter

to the Washington Post and said that the polygraph examinations

had been conducted by another agency.

As noted in the CIA notes in fact, it was CIA that

conducted the polygraph examination in conjunction with the

State Department and the FBI was not involved in any way in

these polygraph examinations. It is recalled that FBI

officials had been called to a White House meeting headed

by Mr. Krogh in which it was indicated we might have to

conduct some polygraph examinations and were so alerted. A

subsequent call from the White House to the FBI instructed

that the FBI polygraph examinations would not be required.

In view of above, it does not appear the FBI would

incur any damage to its reputation or recognized use of the

polygraph in carefully selected criminal and security matters

in which we have jurisdiction.

POLYGRAPH

(Item 7, pgs 65-67)

In regard to the CIA notes concerning the subject

of the lending of Arabic linguists to the FBI, the following

is noted:

The FBI's linguistic capacity is limited to those

foreign languages in which translators can be fully utilized

on a

full-time basis. When we need translations of foreign

language material beyond our normal translation capacity,

we turn to

the governmental linguistic community for

assistance.

Such help has been

obtained in the past from

such agencies as the Library of Congress, Voice of America,

Foreign Service Institute, Defense Language Institute,

CIA, NSA, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U. S. Information

Agency and Smithsonian Institution.

On occasions, we

have also turned to private citizens for help in very

unique situations involving exotic or rare languages.

The massacre of the

Israeli athletes in Munich

at the 1972 Summer Olympics and other Arab terrorist

acts fomented a situation involving the national security

of the United States.

The FBI needed immediate assistance

in the Arabic language field.

A program was immediately

instituted to hire our own Arabic translators and, in the

interim period, CIA lent to our Washington Field Office the

necessary Arabic translators to fulfill our responsibilities.

The opening of the People's Republic of China

Liaison Office in Washington also created a need in the

Washington Field Office for Chinese translators with

special talents. Two such translators were borrowed from

CIA and one of them became an FBI employee for a short

time following

his retirement from CIA.

All arrangements for the loan of Arabic and Chinese

linguists from CIA were effected by the Intelligence Division and

the Washington Field Office through their Liaison with CIA, and

In summary, the CIA notes are accurate. It is

not believed, however, that the FBI would incur any

embarrassmen't or damages as

a result of this interagency

cooperation.

trip involving investigations of any FBI matter occurring

within that road trip and such assignments were not neces-

sarily connected with the Security Squad. SA Hamilton

advised he was

reassigned to the security Squad in Atlanta

luring the Spring or early Summer of 1964 or 1965, and he

believed that, according to his best recollection, this

was in 1964.

The SSC Staff Members questioned SA Hamilton as

to what, if any, assignment he had regarding the inves-

tigation of Dr.

Martin Luther King, Jr., or with the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

Hamilton advised that upon his reassignment to the Security

Squad, he was assigned to monitor a wiretaps on scLe and

SA Hamilton recalled

that lines on the SCLC switchboard and SCLC Wide Area

Telephone Service (WATS) as well as the residence tele-

phone of King were monitored.

The Staff Members inquired

whether tapes of conversations were made from the techni-

cal installation and SA Hamilton replied that occasionally

when it was necessary to record more than one telephone

conversation occurring at the same time, that he occa-

sionally would tape one conversation while preparing a

handwritten log of another, that thereafter the conver-

sation recorded on tape was reduced to a handwritten 1og

when time permitted.

The Staff Members asked what was

done with the recorded tapes following the completion of

the recording and Hamilton advised that when the conver-

sation had been reduced to writing on a 1og

and the tape

was used up, that as best as he could recall, the tape

was erased

and then reused.

The Staff Members asked

whether such tapes were reviewed by other FBI personnel

and SA Hamilton stated he could not recall any situation

where this occurred. The Staff Members inquired as to

whether such tapes were further maintained or placed

somewhere else and SA Hamilton replied he was not aware

The Staff Members

were advised the agent assigned to the case was former

ani toney

SA Robert Nichols and the supervisor was Charles Harding•

At that point the Staff Members inquired as to who was

the supervisor of the Security Squad when SA Hamilton

was first assigned to Atlanta and who were the succeeding

supervisors on that squad.

They were advised that Mr.

s transfer to

FBI Headquarters, Harding became the supervisor.

There-

after, in approximately 1968, Charles Haynes replaced

Harding as supervisor of the

Security Squad in Atlanta.

The Staff Members inquired as to the reason for the

replacement of Harding by Haynes. Hamilton advised

that was an administrative decision made by FBI Headquarters

and since that did not relate to the investigation per-

taining to Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., he would respect-

fully decline to discuss that matter.

The Staff Members

subsequently asked if SA Nichols was subsequently assigned

to the Valdosta, Georgia, Resident Agency of the Atlanta

Office

and, then transferred to another field office.

SA Hamilton advised that was correct.

The Staff Members

inquired as to the reason for SA Nichols' transfer to

another field office,

to which SA Hamilton replied he

Felt that question did not relate to the investigatior

of King and involved an administrative decision by FBI

Headquarters; and, therefore, declined to answer.

Hamilton that he was assigned to monitoring the

upon the retirement of former SA Alan Sentinella in

approximately 19/0. The Staft Members Inquired as to the

period of time thereafter that SCLC remained under inves-

tigation

and what basis lt any there was for closing

the case. SA Hamilton pointed out that since the re-

out that

assignment of the case to him occurred after the death

of king, he felt that question did not directly relate

to the investigation of King and that prior to fur-

nishing an answer to that question, he felt he should

confer with a FBI Headquarters representative who was

then present in the Atlanta Office of the FBl.

Staff Members advised they did desire an answer to that

question and approved of a consultation between SA

Hamilton and the FBI Headquarters representative. SA

Hamilton conferred with the FBI Headquarters represen-

tative then in the Atlanta Office of the FBI and it

was agreed the question regarding the closing of SCLC

and the assignment of that case to SA Hamilton was outside

the parameter of the authority given to SA Hamilton by

FBI Headquarters regarding discussion of Doctor Martin

Luther King, Jr.

However,

in the spirit of cooperation,

it was agreed that SA Hamilton would answer the question

of the Staff Members in this regard. Thereafter, SA

Hamilton advised the FBI investigation regarding

was closed about 1972 or 1973 since a review of the

case file failed to reflect any influence by individuals

or organizations having affiliations with communist

background.

In view of that, it was felt the SCLC case

should be closed.

The Staff Members inquired as to who made the

decision regarding closing of SCLe and whether the matter

was first discussed with FBI Headquarters or other indi-

viduals within the Atlanta Office of the FBI or if it

was a decision made by SA Hamilton alone. Hamilton

advised that as he recalled,

he reviewed the SCLC case

File from that time to a substantial period in the past

and that he recömmended to the supervisor of the Security

Squad that the case be closed since there had been no known

communist influence upon the activities of the SCLC

organization for a long period of time.

to the mechanics of closing the case they were advised

that SA Hamilton dictated a letter to FBI Headquarters

trom the Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta OffiCe,

advising that a review of the file reflected no communist

influence upon the activities of SCLC and that unless

advised to the contrary by FBI Headquarters, the case

was being closed.

The Staff Members asked if a form

letter was used

whereby blanks were filled in and they

were advised this was not the case. The Staff Members

inquired if FBI Headquarters agreed with the closing

and

SẠ Hamilton advised that to his knowledge, no communica-

tion was thereafter received from Headquarters which

would disagree with the closing of that case. The Staff

Members inquired

as to whether SA Hamilton or anyone in

Atlanta conferred with any persons in the New York Office

of the FBI prior to closing the case and SA Hamilton

advised that to his knowledge this did not occur.

The

Staff Members then inquired as to the basis for closing

the case on SCLC as compared with the basis for opening

the case originally. Hamilton advised he did not speci-

fically recall the wording of any communications upon

which the case was originally opened, however, a review

of the case at the time it was closed did not indicate

that SCLC might be involved in any activities which

could constitute a violation of the Internal Security

Statutes.

The Staff Members inquired as to whether the

investigation was based upon the Smith Act and SA Hamilton

stated he did not recall specifically seeing the words

not been

influence was based upon the communist goal of forceable

overthrow of the U.S. Government.

Ralph Abernathy, President of SCLC. They were advised by

Hamilton that that question was not related to the FBI's

investigation of Doctor Martin Luther King, JI., and he

would decline to discuss that matter without further con-

sultation with FBI Headquarters representative in the

Atlanta Office.

The Staff Members did not ask that

Hamilton then discuss that point with the Headquarters

representative.

The Staff Members inquired as to the identities of

other FBI personnel assigned to the monitoring of the tech-

nical installation and SA Hamilton advised he recalled that

at that time SA Robert Thomson and SA John Benton were assigned

o monitoring, however, SA Hamilton could not recal the

dentities ot

other agents assigned during the period of

ime he was assigned to the monitoring of the installation.

removed from the assignment of monitoring the installation

and Hamilton replied that he requested he be removed for the

purpose of being reassigned to security investigative matters.

Mr. Epstein asked SA Burgess when he was assigned

SA Burgess was then asked about the personal type

intormation regarding personal misconduct, whether of not

he felt the collecting of this type of information was

justified.

SA Burgess replied that information regarding

personal misconduct or immoral activities on the part of

King was not the prime purpose or interest of the telephone

monitoring, but that he did feel that evidence of gross

ersonal misconduct and completely amoral activities was

significant in this particular case, bearing in mind the

original justification for the telephone monitor and the

fact that Doctor Maxtin Luther King, JI. was a moral leader

of world stature and a religious personality. SA Burgess

Mr. Epstein then asked SA Burgess if he was quite

certain of his period of assignment to monitoring the

telephones of Doctor King and SA Burgess replied that he was

virtually certain that assignment to these duties was from

surgery approximately six weeks prior to his assignment

on these duties.

Mr. Epstein asked if SA Burgess could ascertain

the date of his surgery from his doctor or hospital records.

SA Burgess replied that surgery had taken place at st.

s Infirmary immediately adjacent to the FBI office

and he would attempt to ascertain the date. Mr. Epstein

asked if SA Burgess would be willing to telephone the

hospital at that time in an attempt to verify this date.

SA Burgess replied that old hospital records are sometimes

difficult to locate and from experience, it would probably

take two or three days.

else immediately available could recall the date of this

surgery, SA burgess replied that his wite might recar..

preceded Haynes as supervisor. He asked why Harding was

replaced and Haynes stated it was a decision made by the

Bureau which was an administrative matter and not pertinent

to the inquiry regarding Martin Luther King, Jr. Epstein

did not pursue this question any further.

Epstein asked when the investigation regarding King

started and if there was a file open prior to the

time the

investigation was authorized. Haynes replied he did not know

when the file was opened or when the investigation was

authorized. Haynes was asked when the technical coverage

regarding King was instituted and when it was discontinued,

and he replied to the best of his knowledge it was instituted

during about November, 1963, and Haynes monitored it until

about January 4, 1964, when Haynes became ill from a kidney

stone attack,

thereafter entering the hospital in Atlanta on

January 8, 1964. Epstein asked Haynes if he returned to

monitoring the surveillance later and Haynes replied that he

did not return to the assignment on a full-time basis,

probably relieved other individuals monitoring several times

during a period which may have continued as long as a year.

Epstein asked when the King case was closed and

Haynes replied he did not know, but felt sure it was some-

time prior to April, 1968. Haynes was asked who made the

decision to close the file, and he stated he did not know.

Epstein asked when the

SCLC case was closed and Haynes

stated he did not recall, but did remember that scLe activity

"wound down" considerably prior to King's death, and even

more so after King's death to the point that the information

did not warrant maintaining the file in'a pending status.

When asked who gave instructions to close the Ille, haynes

stated that he did not recall but that it was possible that

the Atlanta Office took the action closing the file, and it

was even possible that Haynes may have approved such action

administratively; however, he does not recall.

CHARLES T. HAYNES BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Epstein asked if it would be customary for New

York to send Atlanta any information they received regarding

Stanley Levison and if so what file it would be put in.

was explained to Epstein it would be necessary to know the

nature of such information before answering such a question,

York to send any information regarding Levison to Atlanta

unless they had some reason to request information concerning

some pending investigation.

Epstein pressed the question of

whether New York would continue to send Atlanta information

concerning Levison and he was informed, based on information

available at Atlanta, there was no reason for New York to

send the information to Atlanta regarding Levison, without

requesting investigation; however, it was possible that they

have some reason for

having sent information to Atlanta

for informational purposes.

Epstein asked where the monitoring of the King

technical surveillance was conducted and he was advised by

Haynes it was conducted in the Peachtree Towers Building.

He asked the room number and Haynes replied he did not

recall the room number but did recall it was on one of the

He asked who made the in-

stallation and handled the contact with the telephone company,

and Haynes replied he did not know, that the equipment was

in the apartment when Haynes was instructed to report there

for the monitoring assignment. Epstein asked who else was

present in the apartment at the time and was advised that

SA Alden F. Miller was present, connected the equipment

and instructed Haynes in the operation of the equipment. In

response to the question of other Agents monitoring the

technical surveillance at the time, Haynes stated to the best

of his knowledge he was probably the first Agent to monitor

the surveillance, with

• the technical assistance of SA Miller.

Epstein asked the name of the person who rented

the apartment at the reachtree lowers and haynes replied

he did not know.

in the files of the Atlanta Office and Haynes replied he

did not know, explaining that such information may have been

made a matter of record,

and yet may not have been made a

matter of record.

Epstein stated that at this point he would

stop the questioning in order for Haynes to go upstairs to the

FBI Office and review the tiles to determine whether or not

such information was in the files. Haynes explained that such

a project would probably entail extensive file review in order

to state whether

such information was, or was not, in the file.

Epstein asked if Haynes could have someone else conduct the

necessary file review regarding this matter, at which time

Haynes replied he would request a break at this point to con-

sult with an FBIHQ representative in the FBI Office. After

consulting with the FBIHQ representative for approximately

five minutes, Haynes returned to Senator Talmadge's office

and informed Epstein that the clearance for the interview was

based on what Haynes could remember regarding King and not

on information from the files. Epstein was advised that any

request by him for information from the files should be submitted

in writing in the usual manner.

Epstein did not pursue this

matter any further.

Epstein asked 'if Haynes knew Bill Sullivan and if

he recalled him coming to Atlanta. Haynes replied that he

did know sullivan and recalled him coming to Atlanta in the

1960's at least on one occasion and possibly twice. haynes

explained he recalled Sullivan coming to Atlanta in the early

or middle 1960's in connection with a regional type FBI

conference regarding developing

and handling of informants

in Klan organizations, and possibly a second visit at a later

time, but no other details were recalled.

Epstein asked Haynes if he knew of any instance where

an Agent in Atlanta furnished any information regarding King

or the SCLC to the news media and Haynes replied he did not.

Epstein asked if Atlanta had a COINTELPRO file re-

garding King or the SCLC and Haynes advised it did not.

Haynes

was asked if he knew of any COINTELPRO information regarding

King or the SCLC and Haynes stated he did not.

When asked

where such material would be filed, Haynes stated that since

he knew of none he did not know where it would be filed. When

asked if such information could be in the case file, Haynes

advised it was possible.

EDWARD A. SHEA BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

SA Shea was then asked by Mr. Epstein about a re-

view project he had handled earlier in the year pertaining

to the Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) in the

Atlanta Division and what it involved.

SA Shea mentioned that in approximately the latter

part of December, 1974, or early January, 1975, he had beer

assigned to handle a project dealing with COINTELPRO in the

FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) had sent out communications

to various field offices around the latter part of December,

1974, or early January, 1975, relative to the COINTELPRO-Hate

Groups, Black Nationalist Hate Groups, New Left, and Communist

Party, U. S. of America (CP,USA).

In these communications

FBIHQ had indicated it was in receipt of a request under the

Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for documents relating to

the COINTELPRO.

As a result, FBIHQ had reviewed its files

on COINTELPRO and classified

various documents.

FBIHQ listed

these documents in work papers which were sent out to the

various field offices, including Atlanta, as enclosures to

the FBIHQ communications.

These work papers listed documents

that were to be classified in each office and recipients

were instructed to review the work papers to make sure all

copies of these documents classified by FBIHQ were so classi-

fied in the field office files on COINTELPRO.

These work

papers showed the classification assigned

document, the identifying number of the classifying officer,

the exemption category and the date it was classified by

In addition,

these FBIHQ communications instructed

files, such as the ones on the Hate Groups, Black Nationalist

Hate Groups, etc. to insure that all other

documents in these

files which

were classifiable were so classified.

These

were to include memoranda and letters to other offices, etc.

The office that originated the communication had the re-

sponsibility of notifying other recipients of these

communications so their copies could also be classified.

Based on these EBIHQ communications, SA Shea,

who handled this project by himself, located all the documents

sisted in the FBIHQ work papers and classified them according

to the information set out in the work papers.

In addition, SA Shea also reviewed each of the

Atlanta COINTELPRO files on the categories previously mentioned,

for any further documents that should be

• classified.

SA Shea recalled that in this part of the review he

did locate various documents in these files which he felt re-

quired classification.

SA shea could not recall any specific documents

that he so classified but did remember classifying a number

of documents in the COINTELPRO-Hate Group file and COINTELPRO-

and copies designated for any other Atlanta files

field offices that had been furnished copies of these documents

were then notified by Atlanta to locate their copies of these

documents and classify them according to information furnished

by Atlanta.

SA Shea pointed out to the SSC Staff Members that

he recalled that subsequently FBIHQ had sent back communi-

sequently

cations to Atlanta relative to documents SA Shea had classified

in both the COINTELPRO-Hate Group and COINTELPRO-CP, USA files.

FBIHQ instructed that all those classified by SA Shea in the

COINTELPRO-Hate Group file be declassified as they did not

warrant classification and also a number in the COINTELPRO-

CP,USA file also were to be declassified, which was done by

SA Shea.

review of the COINTELPRO files, whether SA Shea had noted any

COINTELPRO actions, any recommended actions, or any COINTELPRO

suggestions which were directed against Reverend Martin Luther

King, JI., Coretta King or the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC). SA Shea indicated that in carrying out

this project, his purpose was first to locate the COINTELPRO

documents listed by FBIHQ in their work papers and classify

them; next he was also to review the Atlanta COINTELPRO files

to see if any other COINTELPRO documents prepared by Atlanta

required classification.

EDWARD A. SHEA BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

In handling this project, SA Shea was primarily

interested in classifying the documents in these COINTELPRO

files and little notice was made of any specific COINTELPRO

actions actually being

recommended in these documents.

SA

Shea pointed out that in his review he did not recall any

COINTELPRO action that had been directed or recommended

against Reverend King, his wife, Coretta, or SCIG.

SA Shea was then questioned as to whether he could

recall in his review, having to classify any Atlanta COINTELPRO

document in which a copy may have been designated for the case

file on SCLC, and SA Shea indicated that he could not recall

or remember anything specific on this.

Mr. Epstein then inquired it the Atlanta Office

SA Shea indicated there

was no such specific breakdown in the Atlanta COINTELPRO files

as they were set up under broad group categories, such as Hate

Groups., Black Hate Groups, New Left, etc.

Mr. Epstein then asked if SA Shea had ever been

involved in handling any COINTELPRO matters when he was

assigned to the Cleveland Office or whether the Cleveland

Office ever had any COINTELPRO actions against Reverend King

or SCLC.

SA Shea indicated that he understood that the

questioning of him would be limited to his review of the

Atlanta COINTELPRO files earlier in the year, for the classi-

discusse purposes sa Sea suggested that this should be

with the FBIHQ representative, who was in the Atlanta

Office at the time, to resolve this; however, Mr. Epstein did

not pursue this.

Mr. Epstein then inquired, that prior to the FBI

instituting the COINTELPRO, and

prior to the various fielc

offices

placed in the case file of the organization or the individual

against whom the action was being directed. SA Shea indicated

he had no knowledge of any such suggestions ever being made

etc., suggesting a counter-

organization prior to the institution of the actual COINTELPRO

by FBIHQ.

Mr. Epstein then asked, if when FBIHQ instituted

the COINTELPRO and the various field offices set up COINTELPRO

files, was there any retrieval of any documents made from any

files dating back prior to the commencement of COINTELPRO,

that were then placed in any of Atlanta's COINTELPRO files.

SA Shea indicated that in his review of the various COINTELPRO

files earlier in the year, he had not noted any such indi-

cation of this.

Mr. Epstein then asked if SA Shea was aware of any

review program dealing with COINTELPRO in which any documents

that there was no program to

were removed from COINTELPRO IvY remove any documents dealing

with COINTELPRO from Atlanta's COINTELPRO files or from any

Shea, Mr. Epstein would come back to his line of questioning

year and whether SA Shea could recall any COINTELPRO action

or COINTELPRO suggested action against Reverend King, Mrs.

King or SCLC.

SA Shea on each occasion pointed out that he

could not recall seeing any documents in any of the COINTELPRO

files which related to any such action directed against the

Kings or SCLC.

Division and to be available for consultation purposes as

indicated. It should be noted that it was necessary during

the course of some of the interviews for the SA to consult with

Phillips as to whether certain information was to be furnished

the intervievers and, notably in respect to SA Charles I. Haynes,

consultation resulted in our refusal to at this time acquiesce

to a request for information from Atlanta FO files. Also, the

intervier of Haynes late afternoon 7/22/75 resulted in a request

for interview of Shea which was arranged on the scene and took

place morning of 7/23/75--details of clearance for this covered

Michael Epstein,

, Staff Member, Senate Select Com-

Seymor Phillips concerning the Bureau's investigation of

Martin Luther

10 a.m., 371/75.

He was advised that this was not possible

and that sometime next week would be more acceptable. It was

agreed that the interview would be conducted at 10 a.m. on

Monday, 8/4/75.

In view of the ongoing discussions between the

Department, representatives of the King family, and the Senate

Select Committee concerning Committee access to information con-

cerning Martin Luther King, Michael Shaheen was contacted con-

It was pointed out to Mr. Shaheen

that Mr. Phillips

had a great deal of knowledge concerning the King investigation

and it could be assumed that information would be disclosed

during interview which might contravene an agreement with the

King family should such an agreement become

perfected. Since

the Department was to meet with representatives of the King

family and Senate Select Committee members on 131/75, It was

suggested that any decision concerning Mr. Phillips' interview

be held in abeyance pending a resolution of this problem.

Shaheen agreed.

Shaheen subsequently advised SA Daly that the meeting

with the King family representatives, Senate Select Committee

representatives and the Department had not resulted in an agree-

He said he had discussed the pending interview of

Mr. Phillips with the Committee Staff representatives and they

said they would furnish guidelines concerning the topics to be

covered during the interview.'

Shaheen indicated these guidelines

would be consistent with the King family's concerns regarding the

RE :

SENSTUDY 75

Steven Blackhurst; Deputy Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination, later advised Inspector Hotis that

SA Phillips could discuss

any aspect of the investigation other

than information developed through wiretaps or microphone

Isurveillance. Mr. Epstein assured him that he was not interested

in the substance of any conversation that might have been overheard,

but would inquire into such procedural matters as the number of

wiretaps installed and the identity of persons who authorized them.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That SA Phillips be released from existing employ-

ment agreement for purposes of this interview, consistent with

the above limitations.

(2) That an Intelligence Division representative

be available but not present during the interview of SA

Phillips in the event that questions arise concerning the

proper scope of the interview.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

JUSTICE

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

May 28, 1975

MEMORANDUM TO ALL EMPLOYEES

RE: INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES

All employees are advised that Congress is conducting

an inquiry into activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Congressional stait members are conducting interviews of former

and current FBI employees. This Bureau has pledged its cooperation

with the Congress.

You are reminded of the FBI Employment Agreement

(copy attached) with which you agreed to comply during your employment

in the FBI and following termination of such employment.

Also, you are reminded of Title 28, Code of Federal

Regulations, Section 16.22 (copy attached), which reads as follows:

"No employee or former employee of the Department of

Justice shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority,

produce any material contained in the files of the Department or disclose

any information relating to material contained in the files of the Department,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of

the performance ot his official duties or because of his official status

without prior approval of the appropriate Department official or the

Attorney General in accordance with Section 16.24."

Also, you are reminded of Department of Justice Order

Number 116-56, dated May 15, 1956, (copy attached) which, among

other things, requires an employee upon the completion of his testimony

to prepare a memorandum outlining his testimony.

Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent

with the above cited authority. Therefore, if you are contacted for

purpose of interview or testimony you are to request approval as

required by the Employment Agreement and await authorization before

furnishing information, testimony, or record material.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised

and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files •

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status.

The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I undersiand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated

under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the

'Deputy Attorney General.

from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized

representatives of such & committee shall be made in the form of a written

mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-

jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogaied as vell as the names of

NEWS CONFERENCE OF CLARENCE M. KELLEY

DIRECTOR,

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

JULY 14, 1975

MR. KELLEY:

Good morning. I have very few statements to make as

an opening. I just

want to say that this is a further

attempt on my part to be a little more available.

Frankly, it is something which I hope we can continue

and I have not in the past been premeditatively evasive

nor reluctant to appear before you. But, frankly, I've

been pretty busy with a number of other things. I want to

let you know that we're continuing our efforts to try to

improve the rapport between us. We will continue to do

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

some things and hopefully, in the future we can get together

more frequently on the basis of some of our past meetings

which I think have been very fruitful. So now I'll throw

it open for questions and these lights are a little bit

strong but I'll try to be able to identify you. Do you

have any questions?

Do you have any evidence, sir, or any information leading

you to suspect any CIA Agents have been planted in any man-

ner or form in any executive agencies for the purpose of

transmitting evidence back to the CIA about that agency?

I have no evidence whatsoever brought to my attention

and I certainly know of none.

QUESTION:

Sir, do you have ongoing programs trying to check out

that sort of thing? Do you look for it?

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

We have no ongoing programs whatsoever and have had no

reports that it has occurred and this is something new

to us.

Sir, there have been complaints repeatedly in recent days

from Congressmen and Senators on the Hill who are charged

with investigating the FBI and its domestic surveillance

in past years that they are not getting the information

that they need. We heard from Senator Church maybe yester-

day. Can you respond to that?

The allegation has been made to the effect that the FBI

is dragging its feet, so to speak, and slow to respond

to the requests of the Church committee for information

relative to past abuses by the FBI in the intelligence field

and it's even been said from time to time that this reluc-

tance is reflective of an effort to preserve the image of

Mr. Hoover. First, I want you to know that in giving

instructions in this matter,

it has been consistently

my policy to say that we should be completely candid

and forthright. And we should respond in whatever manner

we can consistent, of course, with some restrictions--those

being a matter of confidentiality and right to privacy.

Insofar as dragging our feet, the letter which was sent to

us was dated May 14, 1975. We immediately embarked on a

program to try to respond. In May, 1975, I remember it was

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

the last half of May, we devoted 323 man days to try to re-

spond and to date have added another over 400 hours and it's

a total dedication of personnel--of 102 of our people.

We have 102 people who are responding to this request.

The reason why it has taken this much time and this great

amount of manpower is that we must go. through all of

this material very carefully to preserve, of course,

the privacy of those who may be mentioned and also to

assure that matters of grave import are no so

disclosed. We are trying at best we can to resolve

in favor of making them available. I think this number

102 is very significant inasmuch as in the work of the

Freedom of Information, there are also over 102, about

105 people, dedicated to fulfilling our obligations there.

So, we have almost 210 people engaged in these two

enterprises and this has a great impact upon our capabili-

ties.

Does that answer your question?

Can you tell us why Senator Church would be complaining?

Why he what?

Why he would be complaining?

No sir, I don't know.

Some of these things, of course,

may be thought to be too slow and it's

thought, perhaps

that all you have to do is to remove the material from

a great deal of it and intend within the next 10 days to

complete the entire matter.

Is in any of that material now in the Justice Department

awaiting approval of the Attorney General?

Yes,

some of it is in the hands of the Department ready

to be transmitted. That's our first step--after we make .

our survey, to ship it over to them, they review it and then

send it on through.

Well, has it been there for a while?

I can't tell you exactly what length of time but I can say

that within about 10 days, we'll have ours completed and

you can gage thereafter what type of delay is experienced

through the Department.

Mr. Kelley, Senator Church says that you won't allow him

and his staff to interview. FBI Agents and that's one of

the complaints he makes about the lack of cooperation.

Is that true that you will not allow the Senate staff to

interview FBI Agents?

We have gone through a procedure whereby ex-FBI Agents

may have available to them our people in order to consult

with them as to any matter which might, be thought to

violative of some of the confidentiality provisions; and

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

we have not,

to my knowledge, denied the right of anyone

presently employed to be interviewed with, of course again,

the requirements that if they want to consult with us

they may do so.

Well, in other words, you're saying that FBI Agents can

be interviewed by the Senate staff.

Is that correct?

Let me just check that. Mr. Mintz, is that correct? Have

we denied any?

We have not denied any. We've not indicated to anyone

we would not let them be interviewed.

What was that Mr. Kelley, about ex--I didn't understand,

about ex-FBI Agents?

Ex-FBI Agents, when called, and we're advised, are informed

that one of our people can be present outside the inter-

view room for consultation by that interviewee with our

people to determine whether or not a certain question is

beyond the purview of his capability, and we do not say to

him that he cannot answer but we do say here are the rules,

the regulations, the law and you can be guided in accordance

with your own dictates. But we make available to him a con-

sultant, so to speak.

Is that a requirement or..?

- 4*

That's an agreement between us.

In other words, when an ex-Agent goes up, he has to have

somebody?

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

No sir, he does not have to have but we inform him that

he may have if he so desires.

During your confirmation hearings two years ago,

you advocated or said that you would like to see

more Congressional oversight of the FBI. You think now

that there's too much, just about right, or not enough

oversight?

It is true that I said during my confirmation that I do

not object to FBI Congressional oversight. One has been

established and I have met with them on several occasions

to set an oversight committee. There is also a House

so-called oversight committee--it's the House Judiciary

Committee--there are others who may by virtue of their

jurisdiction feel that they, too, have oversight. We do

no oppose House oversight. Frankly, I would like to have

a joint committee of oversight so that we can know

precisely to whom we should report and they, in turn, know

precisely to whom any oversight problems can be referred.

Basically, in other words, I do not object to oversight--

I do think that it would be much better if we could have

it well-structured so that it will be clearly understood

by all parties concerned as to what they are going to do

and how they are to do it.

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

Mr. Kelley, do you feel the oversight being conducted now

between the Senate and House is probing too deeply into the

FBI--do you

feel that any of the operations of the FBI have

been hurt by the investigations going on now?

I do not construe the activities of the oversight groups

as having delved too deeply into the work of the FBI. We do

on occasion feel that perhaps some matters need protection,

particularly those involving national security, but I have

no objection in the exchange in oversight groups of any

matter in which we are engaged. I think, as a matter of

fact, that this is a proper balance insofar as keeping us

in line and I also welcome it inasmuch as it gives us an

opportunity to explain just what and how we do things. I

do not object to the exchange, in other words.

Mr. Kelley, you said that you're not attempting to preserve

the image of J. Edgar Hoover and, apparently, you know

what will be in the information that is to go out of your

office in 10 days. Can you tell us, when that information

gets up to the Hill and assuming it's made public, are there

going to be some more bomb shells about the FBI that we

haven't heard about or is this all information which has

generally been made public?

I don't know of any bomb shells, so to speak. In the news

media, there have been many things discussed, many reports

made, and in those matters I think that just about every-

thing that we know about has been already, at least to

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

some extent, discussed and, to some extent, publicized..

I am

convinced that in these matters where there might be

some criticism, there is an underlying intent to do that

which is good for the Nation. I have not come across any

activities which I would construe as being illegal, being

directed toward personal gain or to enhance the reputation

of anyone. I see nothing untoward in these activities, in

other words, as they will be reviewed by the various groups.

Now, MI. Kelley, Mr. Sullivan said about a week ago, that

he assumed there had been some national security break-ins '

over the years and I'm just wondering if there have been

national security break-ins, say in the last five years,

roughly what number are we talking about and why aren't

they illegal? What's the legal authority?

There have been statements made about surreptitious

entries and the latest was that statement made

by Mr. Sullivan who just retired as the Assistant

Director in Charge of the Los Angeles Office; and there

have been, of course, reports in the media that the

Department of Justice has been inquiring into allegations

that our people have engaged in surreptitious entries or,

as they are sometimes termed, burglaries. Yes, the FBI

has conducted surreptitious entries in securing information

relative to the security of the Nation. However, in 1966,

all such activity was terminated with the exception of

a small amount of actions which were conducted in connection

with foreign counterintelligence investigations which we

felt had a grave impact upon the security of the Nation.

And again, as I just said, I feel that the FBI personnel

participating in or approving such activities acted in

good faith with the belief that national security interests

were paramount and their actions were reasonable. I'm

always mindful of a story I heard many years ago about two

neighbors who

started some arguments which, obviously,

were going to terminate into difficulties. One of the

neighbors started a campaign to build himself up with

shadowboxing, punching the bag and so forth, and it appeared

very likely that he was going to be in pretty good shape

in order to beat up his neighbor and so the neighbor,

thereafter, concerned as to what would happen to him,

started to defend himself. You don't wait until the

climax which could be the putsch--you start preparing

yourself and so I think that the FBI and its officials

construed this as paramount again in the protection of

the country.

You said that in 1966, there were a small amount of

burglaries. I'm just wondering how small is small and

Mr. Kelley, were these directed against Americans or

I know of none overseas.

Sit, going back to prior to 1966, why was the procedure

changed in 1966?

By virtue of the feeling of Mr. Hoover that, under the

then-prevailing philosophy and the feeling that possibly

in the context of the times, this was not a viable

procedure--they were stopped. "It was Mr. Hoover's

decision.

Sir, can we infer that there were quite a number, a

large number, of burglaries prior to 1966, but fewer

since then?

great majority of them are what we now term counter-

The resolution of the problem which you now present

is up to the Department and the courts, and I, of

that in the defense of the men who authorized and

participated, that they had this intent and within

every criminal violation there is a necessity that

Mr. Kelley, would you say, sir, that most of these

requests for surreptitious entry flowed from presi-

No, I did not say that. I did not give a complete

outline as to what the authorization was. And, this

again will be a matter which will be discussed in

I have no judgment insofar as that because my

an inference was made it was not intended by me

to give them any sanctuary. I'm trying to keep in

the area of our facts and that particular thing as

to whether or not they had any intent or whether or

not it is a viable defense is up to the courts.

MI. Kelley, did you twice mention that you expect

some resolution to this question in the courts?

How is it going to get into the courts?

I don't know. It possibly will be some sort of a

defense, rather some sort of a presentation to the

courts by the Attorney General.

He has indicated

that perhaps this being a Constitutional question--

it being a matter of the executive privilege of the

presidential power--that it might well be necessary

to have such a review to determine.

Were all of these break-ins conducted with the

permission of either the Attorney General or the

President at the time? Or were there any that were

conducted without such approval?

I cannot, at this point, give you any particulars

about the program. I just say, as I did berore,

and this....

Because you don't know or because you're withholding

comment?

I'm withholding comment.

Mr. Kelley, I'm still unclear about distinction

between break-ins before 1966 and afterward.

Is the

reduction in number the only change that was made or

was there change in the limitations on the targets

that were used?

There was a change insofar as the targets just being

in the subsequent area confined to those matters which

were concerned in foreign counterintelligence.

Were I to

I don't think this is proper." I have

the benefit of hindsight. I have the benefit of exper-

ience in local law enforcement which, I think, prepares

me to better understand perhaps the impact of

some of

these types of things. They are not at all unknown in

the field of law enforcement. In some degree or another

almost all the law enforcement has engaged in some

similar types of activities. Not perhaps to the sophisti-

cation as the COINTEL Program, but the context of the

time is felt necessary in the present day.

We realize

that different standards should be applied and they are

and we do not engage in those activities now. Since

April, 1971, we cut them off.

(NOTE TO CORRESPONDENTS AND EDITORS: The preced-

ing comment by Mr. Kelley concerning local police

use of efforts similar to COINTELPRO may be open

to misinterpretation.

At his direction

the FBI

later issued his clarifying statement: "I had in

mind that law enforcement agencies have used

methods designed to create disunity among the

criminal element, particularly in organized crime

and hoodlum gangs.

Probably most common was

labeling a crime

figure as a police informant

to discredit and destroy his criminal influence.

These activities to pit one crime figure against

another have achieved success in neutralizing

the criminal element.")

You said that you disagreed with some of the activities,

that they were not proper programs.

Alright, does that

mean that there are variations of COINTEL Programs

still going on?

In the first place, we deliniate certain programs.

That's the overall

structure of the full system.

Within each of these programs there were some activ-

ities, individual activities. I feel that the setup

of the programs certainly was directed properly, that

is, with the intent to preserve the Nation.

When you were an Agent did you engage in any

being investigated by the Department and is being

investigated by the various committees, particu-

larly the Select Committee of Congress

and, I'm

not saying that Clarence Kelley engaged in such

activites, or did not engage in these activities.

I'm merely saying that these have been presented

for review and they will, thereafter, be discussed

at some length and any publicity that might be

given them will be that which will be given by

those more knowledgeable than I.

Mr. Kelley, to your knowledge have any members of

the FBI been involved in the planning or execution

of assassinations?

No, sir. I know of none.

Mr. Kelley, how about the break-in of embassies

here in Washington.

Have any members of the FBI

gained surreptitious entry into any embassies in

Washington?

Without naming or designating victims or insti-

tutions, I can only say that there were a few

concerned with counterintelligence--foreign in

nature--subsequent to 1966. Further then that

I cannot say.

A few is 10, 20, 100?

When you say few, I'm sure

that I'm lost as to how few is a few.

Not many.

Was a lot of this done in Washington as opposed

to other cities in the country?

There were not a lot, I'm confident of that. And,

confined to Washington, D. C., but I can't tell

or crime in connection with his official duties.

Is there any agreement with the Justice Department

not to prosecute people who may stray from or

commit crimes but, rather to handle it with

internal discipline?

I can assure you absolutely that

There's nothing worse in my

what we have when one of your own people defects

crminal world.

How do you account than for the fact that there

has been no one who has

strayed across the line

in all these years? It's almost unhuman.

Well, I appreciate your compliment, Mr. Kelly,

which I agree with, there has been none. There

have been, of course, some allegations made

from time to time, all of which have been pursued

and found to be groundless. I think that it's

inherent in an organization which is closely

scrutinized, an organization which has a strong

inspection system but, more than anything else,

is the choice of people who are not susceptible

to this type of thing. Unquestionably, in such

a screening process some might get through.

But, than, within the FBI is a built-in system

which further prevents this possibility and that

is a tremendous pride in this very matter.

That

is, that there has been no corruption. And, I

be done.

And, I assure you, will be done.

Unusual

perhaps, but nonetheless, it is present and we will

persist with this type of activity.

We don't ask

our Agents to squeel on one another, we point out

the splendid reputation that is inherent within

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

Mr. Kelley, earlier you spoke of the advantages and limitations

of hindsight. After having examined the records of the break-ins

and other surreptitious activity, you observed that you thought it

was well intentioned, I believe, in most cases. Did you also

observe that there was any gross misuse of authority in the

process of that?

I do not note in these activities any gross misuse of authority.

I see a consistent thread of well-intentioned activities. Perhaps

now in the present society, and in the context of now and in those

times, I do not feel that it was a corruption of the trust that

has been placed in us. As now we have determined a valuation

that perhaps could be wrong, but in those days there was no

intention to engage in activities which were prohibited, illegal,

or otherwise wrong.

Mr. Kelley, why wouldn't an act like the bugging of Martin Luther

King's hotel room have been a betrayal of trust? These Agents

took an oath under the Constitution and that was prohibited by

Federal law at that time.

There have been a number of articles written about this situation.

In reviewing this situation, I feel that the authority stemmed from

the proper source. It was a matter which was construed in those

times as of considerable concern to the country, and the FBI acted

in accordance with the request which was made that it be installed.

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

You say that it was a matter which was then a violation of the

law. Within the warrantless wiretaps under ordinary circum-

stances they could conceivably be construed as a violation, but

under the umbrella of the protection of the country they have

been authorized, so I don't subscribe to the feeling that they

knowingly, in such an installation, vilated the law with the

intent to violate the law.

Mr. Kelley, do you still--does the FBI still--compile personal

information on the personal behavior of Members of Congress,

members of the press, and other people?

The FBI receives a great deal of information from time to time.

We are charged when we have a complaint to write up that

complaint. We feel that not only are we following the archival

rules that such must be recorded, but also we feel in discharge

of our duties we should record it because such information might

well dovetail with some investigation that we are conducting.

11.

People come to us to tell about these things for reasons--not

just to spill out gossip and rumor and to possibly put someone

on the spot. We inform them, for example, at the time they

submit this information a record will be made of this but if it is

outside the jurisdiction of the FBI we so state. They know before

they leave, for example, that nothing will be done about it other

than to record it.

of these allegations. I assure you that this will not continue to

Mr. Hoover kept that were called his confidential or OC files and

whether or not anyone within the Bureau knew about those files

and failed to tell you about them?

Jack, that's a long answer, but I will try to brief it. I first learned

of the possibility that these files existed in January, 1974. I then

was presented a list of some of the files and called in one of the

Assistant Directors and said what is this all about. Should they

be integrated into the general file system, and I mean by that that

we have a general file system. We have a section of our files which

are kept in a separate room because we don't want everyone to

have the capability of going into them. The man who was charged

- 26 -

with the responsibility of looking into this then within a few

months retired. The next stimulation of this situation arose

after a statement appeared in the paper mentioning these files

and we immediately talked about this. Still I did not look at the

files. I then instructed that our Inspection Division go over them and

make a listing of them, categorizing them. Some of them, of

course, were purely administrative, some included information

as outlined by Mr. Levi. Such a listing was made and was turned

over to the Department. Thereafter Mr. Silberman looked them

over and thereafter Mr Levi looked them over and I made a

rather cursory check of them myself. Why did I not look these

files over in the first place? I did not construe them as being with-

in the realm of the so-called dossiers that had been mentioned

before and during,

certainly, my confirmation. I said I did not

subscribe to the preparation or retention of dossiers on Congress-

men nor members of the Senate. I still persist in that and we have

not. My references were about those which were declared

improper during Mr. Gray's administration and they were at that

time stopped. These were dossiers that were prepared on candidates

• for Members of Congress and those who failed in their venture

were destroyed. Those which were successful were put into the

general files.

We no longer do that and frankly, in my opinion,

this is what was referred to. I feel that these files should be

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

maintained confidential. I still have not given them a close

review. I have not done so for the very reason as I mentioned

about my own file. I don't think it will benefit me to go over

them. Under archival rules they must be preserved. In the

guidelines which are to be established, I will welcome any

reasonable guideline which says we either do or do not preserve

them. I am anxious for us to do our work the way it should be

done. More than that, I cannot say.

Mr. Kelley, there have been suggestions that your absences

from Washington for family reasons have prevented you from

getting the kind of control of the Bureau that you would have if

you were here all the time. I am wondering how you respond

to that kind of suggestion?

My response is that I feel that I have been able to maintain

control. I am certainly in constant touch. I have telephone

calls that are relayed to me when I have made such trips. I am

confident that the executive staff of this Bureau is solidly behind

me. I say this inasmuch as I have somewhat a feeling such as

may be implied in your question. I must as a result of

• conditions that you know about make these trips. If I feel that in

so doing it will endanger my administrative control and my

capability of doing that which I think should be done, I will leave.

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

There is no question whatsoever because that which I say applies

to others should also apply to me. But, I do feel that I have

control of the organization. I have known of no disruptive tactics that

might have been launched to unseat me and again were there any.

evidence of that and found, in my opinion, to be one which is well

grounded, I would immediately leave.

Mr. Kelley, if I can return for the moment to the subject of

break-ins. You said that conditions of national security and

foreign intelligence--there may have been other areas.

I wonder

if you can be a little clearer on whether there were any break-ins

that were not related to foreign intelligence or national security?

I know of none.

Thank you Mr. Kelley.

Director Sec'y -

It should be noted that CIA's input into these

programs has been highly valuable and productive and is

designed to give FBI Agents a better insight into the Soviet,

Satellite and Chicom

target based on CIA's overseas: experience,

against these targets.

Two of the lectures usually given at

these courses include

the structure, function and role of CIA

and the structure, function and role of the

JFK Act 6 (1)

These lectures have been beneficial in teaching our

Special Agents about the mutually complimentary roles of CIA

overseas and the FBI in the United States in working against

hostile intelligence targets.

CIA officers who lecture to our classes have been

careful to emphasize CIA's experience against these hostiles

from an overseas perspective and their overseas experiences.

Memorandum to Mr. W. O. Cregar

Re:

!'

Item 6. Three Special Agents, Neil Rice, Larry

McWilliams, and John McCaffrey, attended this Soviet Operations

course at CIA Headquarters.

The course ran from May 14 to

May 25, 1973. Special Agent McCaffrey only attended one week

while Rice and McWilliams attended for two weeks.

The primary reason for FBI inclusion in this course

was because, at that time, the three special Agents were

members of the new Training Unit, INTD, and we were seeking

educational guidance and ideas for our basic CI courses ther

under development.

We benefited from this course because we

borrowed a few educational ideas and techniques from CIA's

method of handling its course.

RECOMMENDATION:

None.

he was assigned to the investigation of Soviet espionage matters.

James Patrick Kehoe, EOD 3-26-51, GS-13, $27,632, married with one

child, has been assigned to New York City since 1953. Prior to the 1960's

through the present he has been assigned to the investigation of Soviet

espionage matters.

black radicalism in earnest in 1968 and as a result CIA's

Directorate of Intelligence published studies on 8/6/69

This page revealed in each of these studies

there was a single paragraph devoted to ties with U. S. black

power movement and primarily concerned visits of Stokely

Carmichael and other U. S. black power activists to the

Caribbean.

The second study was to pay special attention to

links between black radicalism in the Caribbean and advocates

of black power in U.S.

Re:

The study on page 13 reports "Unlike its fairly frequent

contacts with Black Panthers and other radicals in the U.S.,

Black Panthers

the Castro Regime seems to have refrained from more than

occasional communications

regarding contacts between Black Panthers and other radicals

in the U. S. and the Castro Regime.

Paragraph number 33 on

page 13 of this study notes that the extent of relations

between black power groups in the Caribbean and similar

organizations in the U. S. is vague.

Activities of "the

more activist Negro leaders in the U. S. such as Stokely

Carmichael and Elijah Muhammad have been followed closely

have

been limited in the past two or three years because of a ban

on the travel of certain U. S. Negro spokesmen by the

Governments of Jamaica, Antigua and Trinidad-Tobago.

study notes the latter

government had refused to permit

Carmichael to enter the country despite the fact that he is

a native of Trinidad.

The 6/12/70 study on page seven noted that available

evidence suggested that contact between Caribbean groups and

the black power movement in the U. S. is infrequent.

occasional speaking tours by Carmichael and one or two other

It was presumed that exchanges of views and

sharing of information occurred but the study noted there

was no firm evidence of funding or direction by U. S. groups.

There is no data on page 188 or published in the

two CIA studies which would compromise or damage FBI operations

or sources.

Re page 189

This page indicates that for several months in the

first half of 1968 the Caribbean branch (apparently of the

Director of Current Intelligence, CIA) wrote periodic typescript

memoranda on Carmichael's travel

abroad during a period when he

had dropped out of public view.

This page indicates that it was

felt these memoranda were for internal GIA use only although

a copy of one such memorandum was inadvertently sent to the EBI.

Re:

SENSTUDY 75

W.

R. Wannall

Bureau file 100-446080 contains numerous communications

from CIA concerning Stokely Carmichael's activities and travel

during late 1967 and early 1968.

These memoranda included

data concerning Cuban Intelligence Service contacts with

Carmichael and his travel, including trips to North Vietnam

and Algeria.

It is probable these memoranda were furnished FBI

due to our interest in establishing the degree

of foreign

influence or funding

in relation to Carmichael's activities

in the U.S.

Data on page 189 and in the memoranda furnished by CIA

concerning Carmichael's whereabouts during this period does

not compromise or damage FBI operations or informants.

Re page 283

This page noted under date of 12/10/70 that "DDI"

noted press accounts of Director Hoover's 11/19/70 statement

reported that the Black Panthers are supported by terrorist

organizations. This page reveals that someone: with Cla had

examined FBI'

locate no indication of any relationship between FEDAYEEN and

the Black Panthers.

this topic.

Re: Further Documents Pertaining to the

FBI and Department of Justice

Policies and Procedures

(Appendix B, Part I, Item

• l.a.)

NOTE:

The material to be reviewed consists of clean

Xerox copies of the approximately 335 selected SAC

Letters and Menoranda.

Each of the SAC letters and

Menoranda was reviewed by the following Divisional

representatives who cleared such material for review

by the SSC Staff with respect to their Division's

interasts:

Identification - J. T. Stewart, Training -

J. I. Reilly, Administrative - F. Woodworth, Files and

Communications - H. R. Hauer, General Investigative -

J. W. Hines, Laboratory - R. F. Petty, External Affairs -

D. L. Divan, Special Investigative - J. L. McHale,

Inspection - F. B. Griffith, Legal Counsel - P. V. Daly,

Computer Systens - C. D. Neudorfer. INTD reviewers who

cleared the above material with respect to INID interests

for reviewing by the SSC Staff were:

J. W. Johnson

(1971 - 1972), H. W. Dare (1962 - 1966), R. D. Hampton

(1968 - 1973 - 1974 - 1975), R. L. Moore (1964 - 1965 -

1967), K. A. Mendenhall (1960 - 1969), and I. E. Burns, Jr.

(1961 - 1963 - 1970).

Excisions were made in the material

by the above INID personnel with regard to protection of

sources, third agency considerations and with respect to

sensitive methods and techniques.

Since the material is

to be reviewed at FBI Headquarters and in order to expedite

the process of making the material available and avoid

unnecessary extensive effort, the various SAC Letters and

Memoranda have not been classified nor have they been

excised with regard to privacy considerations in all instances.

The SSC Staff representative (s) will be orally advised of the

above at the time of their review at FBI Headquarters. Should

the SSC Staff seek certain specific copies of the SAC Letters

or Memoranda, those items selected will then be appraised

with regard to classification and privacy considerations,

prior to furnishing any copies to the SSC Staff for

their off-premises perusal. None reviewed pertained to OPE

responsibilities.
