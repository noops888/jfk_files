Moscoe from September 1-14, 1975 to

undertake research at the USSR

Acadeny of Sciences, under the USS?./Canada General Exchange

Agreenent.

The research was carried

out at the leademy of Sciences

Computer Centre, 40 Vaveoha Straet KU.oi's host vas

_and on whom a separate

personality sketch is attached.

On September 3 while having a coffee break in the Computer

Centre KUNOV was approached

by a man who identified himselr as

Willian HARTIi, an American who defected to the Uss? in 1950.

openly spoke about his past and stated that he now lives in Moscow

and that he is a consultant to

group at the Computer

Centre.

He said much of his work is done at home but he does drop

Into the Centre weekly.

It was at this time that MARTIN told XUllOY that he would

Tike to get out of the USSR even if he has to run certain risks.

also said that (Bernon) MITCHELL feels the same and has

voiced his

desire to the Sovict authorities.

PARTIN asked KUlOV if he might enquire with the Canadian

authorities on his behalf to see what his status would be in this

country or li there was any chance of his being alloed in here as

a political refugee.

KUNOV agreed to contact the Canadian Embassy

in loscow to see what the official view would be and notify MARTI!

at a later date.

MARTIN seemed most pleased at this and left kulov

his home telephone nunber,

cautioning him not to say anything over

phone that would tio off the Sovict authorities as to his intentions.

This first meeting lasted a little over one half hour and took olace

in the coffce lounge area of the Centre.

There were other Sovicts

present in the lounge, however,

was not among them. KUroV does

not believe the others were aware of their conversation®

On the 5 September 75 KUNOV called at the Canadian Embassy,

Moscow and spoke to a doorman asking him no he might speak to

regarding some Americans living in the USSR who would like to immierate

The doorman referred KUlOV to the office of a

to Canadas kilov then sroke to a U/ who stated that he was the

der inete fosh and asked could they be allored to immigrate to

KUNOv enquired about the Americans

living in the

Canada.

The imbassy official would not commit himself and stated that

KUNOY should enouire officially with the nearest office of Manpower

and Inmigration when he returned to Canada.

KUloV did not give this

official lARTll or KITCHELL's names.

KUNOV telephoned MIRTIN after

the Embassy visit and stated that the reply from the imbassy was

negative.

PARTIN scened upset that KUNOV should phone him, then he

later stated that it would probably be all right.

MARTIN met KUNOV on at least two occasions after the

5 September, all at the Centre, usually in the coffee lounge and in

presence of others.

They spoke English at all times.

MARTIN thanked KUNCV for his trouble in enquiring at the Encassy

cautioned KUROV not to get personally involved with him in this

venture as it rould be bad news.

KUrO! promised MIRTIl that he would

check with Canadian F'anpover and Irmigration authorities on the

matter when he returned

of. Interest with a Canadian Embassy Officer..

Wilkinson stated

that while attending a social function at the Australian Embassy,

he engaged Canadian Consular Officer Geoffrey FARROi in conver-

sation.

Farrow advised that he had been recently approached by

DI..

Harry KLRIUV, an Associate Professor of English at the

University oi Toronto in Canada, regarding Anerican detectors

Bernon F. MITCHLLL and Willian li MARTIN®

Kernov implied that

he had had recent personal contact with one of both of the

defectors and reconmended that the Canadian government give

Martin and Michell permission to emigrate to Canada..

Farrow

furnished no further details regarding kernov's contact.

During the same conversation Farrow asked Wilkinson if he

could supply any basie background material on Mitchell and Nartin.

Wilkinson replied that he would pass Farrow's sequest on to

the Consular Section of the Inbassy.

Subsequently, farrow was

given an unclassified article concerning the defectors which

appeared in the Juno 1961 issue of True magazine.

Ne would, of course, be interested in any indications that
