ReLIPi indicates a renewed interest in alignnent
between the Blackstone Rangers, a Negro criminal youth gang,
and the black extremist Black Panther Party, both extremely
violence prone.

Your office must follow this matter closely in
order to be aware of current developments as they occur.
Appropriate informants and sources must be given specific
assignments to develop current and timely information
‘regarding any contemplated alignment of these two organizations.

Keep the Chicago Police Department apprised of ail

NOTE: 7 492 JUN 24 1970

The Blackstone Rangers is the largest.of the Hegro
youth gangs in the Chicago area and operate on the South
Side. Its membership is estimated at 2,000, with the majority
of its members being teenagers. The organization has
approximately 40 subdivisions operating as individual gangs.
There is an ever present danger should this large Negro
youth gang develop black nationalism and align themselves
with black extremist organizations such as the Black Panther
Party.

In recent days, Jeff Fort, President of the Black

Muhammad's Temple No. 2, 5335 South Greenwood, Chicago, and
protested the above article claiming the NOI had joined ranks
with the GIU and the political machinery of Chicago. Fort pro-
claimed the article to be an insult. Fort advised his group

‘was willing to try and work out in any way the problems that

beset their people but added they would not continue to tolerate

‘misinformation from the NOI or any other group which would

alienate the black community from‘its children.

Fort protested recent articles in "Muhammad Speaks"
tended to hold his group responsible for all gang slayings;
tended to imply his group was worse than the hoodlums; tended

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

‘A Chicago Police Department (PD) source advised on
May 28, 1969, a truce had been declared between the Blackstone
Rangers and the Disciples, the two largest youth gangs opor-
ating on Chicago's South Side. Spokesmen for each gang advised
they would discipline their members and reprimand those
ereating any trouble in South Side neighborhoods. Spokesmen
for the gangs were critical of recent pleas by the Cook
County State's Attorney in local news media requesting
neighborhood cooperation by citizens in reporting gang
activities.

Captain Fogerty, Watch Commander, Second PD District,
advised on May 29, 1969, Gregory Green, a Negro male, age 14,
residing at 4120 South Prairie Street, Chicago, was shot and
killed at approximately 11:00 PM on May 28, 1969. The shooting
occurred in the vicinity of 4000 South Indiana Street.

Captain Fogerty also advised that Edward Payne, Negro
-male, age 16, residing at 4928 East 78th Street, was shot in
‘the hip in the vicinity of the above killing. This shooting
occurred at approximately the same time as the one noted above.
Payne was in good condition. According to Captain Fogerty, both
were separate incidents. He concluded by saying that both
incidents were believed to be related to youth gang recruiting
drives in the area.

Detective Breen, Area 1, Homicide, Chicago PD, advised
on May 29, 1969, the individuals set forth below were arrested
and. have been charged with the murder of Gregory Green:

A confidential source, who is involved in gathering
intelligence information in the Chicago area, and who is 4
familiar with youth gang activities in Chicago, provided the
following information to a representative of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation:

The source advised the Blackstone Rangers is a
Negro youth gang operating in a large territory on the south
side of Chicago. This organization is considered as one of
the better organized street gangs in Chicago and because of
much publicity in national news media, this gang has been
given added recruiting power. Because of the apparent
expansion of the Blackstone Rengers they have now endeavored
to expand to some of the suburban areas to the south of Chicago
and generally use’ the name of the Black P. Stone Nation, in
. the areas of this current expansion.

Source also advised that many Negro youth clain
affiliation with the Blackstone R-ngers since it seems to serve
a particular purpose when in fact the youth may not be a member.
The source advised there is growing indication that the Black-
stone Rangers are being used by adult individuals both white and

Re: BLACKSTONE RANGERS

Negro, in an attempt to operate quasi-legal business operations
in the Negro commmities. Source advise some of these business
operations give. the appearance of having affiliation with
highly unsavory - individuals.

This source advised that there are continuous
rumors of members of the Blackstone Rangers becoming involved
in many illegal activities such as armed robberies, burglaries,
and strong-arming. Source advised that from time to time arrests
have been made of individuals involved in such illegal activities
and it has been learned that many of these youth have been
affiliated with the Blackstone Rangers.

Source advised tht there appears to be a growing
number of shooting incidents involving members of the Blackstone
Ringers and the number of firearms in the possession of
Blackstone Ranger-members also seems to be on the increase.

Source advised that the Blackstone Rangers as a
group have from time to time endeavored to be involved in
Tegal and constructive programs such as youth training in the
theatre and musical events. Source advised that because the
Blackstone Rangers in the past have had access to considerable
amounts of funds, this has created an atmosphere of competition

. from other youth gangs. This competition seems to be created
so that funding agencies will make money available so as to

_ prevent further gang activities. This has apparently made
gang recruitment more active and consequently intra~gang fights
‘and. shootings have been on the increase.

The source advised that the BlackstomRangers

have been affiliated with several churches on the south side
. of Chicago and has access to several church facilities for
their meetings and places of entertainment.

The source advised that some individuals apparently
members of the Blackstone Rangers have in the past several
months been approaching businessmen on the south side of
Chicago suggesting the businessmen "donate" money to assist
the Rangers in preventing violence. Source advised that
few of these events have proven to be prosecutable extortion
cases, however, a suggestion of pressure is created,

Re: BLACKSTONE RANGERS

Source advised that several of the Blackstone
Rangers Have from time to time in the past year been
arrested and some are presently appealing cases in which
they have been fourid guilty.

Source advised that in: the past few months there
appears to have been an indication that the Blackstone
Rangers and other Hegro youth gangs in Chicago have
attempted to come to terms on peaceful groimds to
terminate intra-gang killings or they have attcmpted to
negotiate a coalition pact. Source advised thet on at least
one occasion the Black Panther Party (BPP) has made overtures
of friendship with the Blackstone Rangers.

Attached hereto is a cheracterization of the
Bp?. This source advised, however, that on several occasions
_ there have been indications of suggested armed worfare between
the Blackstone Rangers and the BPP.

The source advised that Blackstone Rangers under
their present structure do not appear to be interested in
eny close alliance with any other group and that they
apparently do not have need financially or membership wise
to bargain with any other orgenizations.

Hee This source advised that the Blxckstone Rangers
thas been in existance as a gang in one form or 2other for
many years. Currently, however, the gang hes been given more of
a professional atmosphere, because of the involvement of
old individuals snd forces not within the confines of the south
side Chicego. This gang more than any other in the Chiecgo crea
has ta ken on the more awesome atmosphere than "a mere street
gang.

1 APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

7 According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to q
* organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the |

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence oi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
* describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the ©
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

“The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following:

: "Black men.: Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the
October 5, 1968, edition of ''The Black Panther" is the statement, "...
we will not dissent from Ameriéan Government. We will overthrow it."

: Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic
_ of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of
the barrel of a gun."
The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United States.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official eweniper! the Black Panther Party
\(BpP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life, polities, and the
* destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,
BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton
is presently serving a sentence o! 2 to 15 years on a conyiction of man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "THe Black Panther,” which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themsclves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the pubjication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968. contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

: "Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
‘revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. - The only culture worth keeping
‘is a.revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the
* October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "... °
+we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it.”

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People’s Republic
* of China and feature MAO's a that "political power grows out of
_ the barrel of a gun." :

The national Rees of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United Staics.

In view of the information contained in memorandum

of Peoria, Illinois, will be burned down during the month
&@ October, the Chicago Office should immediately contact
racial informants and other strategically placed sources
who can report on plans of Blackstone Rangers for specific

Chicago should capitalize on any rapport developed through
interviews of Blackstone Rangers' members during Demcon
investigation into their activities, and attempt to enlarge
upon information contained in memorandum dated 9/4/68 at

it should be expeditiously furnished Springfield Division so

_ appropriate authorities may be notified,

He advised that the headquarters for the Blackstone
Rangers is located in a church at the corner of 63rd and State
Street and this church was the subject of an investigation
conducted by the Government and that the white preacher or
priest who testified had ‘lied about there being guns, ammunition
and other weapons in the church. Source advised that the weapons
are contained in a vault underneath the front steps of the church
and that they are located in a vault which only the priest and
JEFF FORT are able to open. Source advised that the vault

restaurants in the Cermack District and that the proceeds : Ep
are turned over to the Blackstone Rangers. Source advised ]
that these establishments were opened by the Government to F

at 63rd and State is located under the front entrance and
that you get there by taking the stairs on the right and
go to the basement and that the yault is located under the
steps.

Source advised he knows of no other groups that
are started in other sections of the country but thinks some
attempt might have been started to form groups in Detroit,
Michigan, however, he could not verify this. He further
advised that the reason for going to Peoria in October was
that MARTIN LUTHER KING was supposed to have a march there
which had never come off and that the Blackstone Rangers
are going to go there and finish the job. He advised that
if and when they go to Peoria that in all probability OSCAR
BROWN, JR. will charter the buses and make all the arrangements
for the group to travel, -

which reflected that the Blackstone Rangers were using the
Pleasant Valley Farm, located in Mc Henry County for military
training. State Police source advised that he observed the
Blackstone Rangers training at instant farm on May 15, 1968,

SA JOSEPH B. GRAFF, RA, Waukegan, Illinois, advised
on June 7, 1968, that JAMES MASON, Director of the Pleasant
Valley Farm advised on this date that instant farm is operated
by the Community Renewal Society, located at‘116 South Michigan
and is primarily for the purpose and use for underprivileged
children in the Chicago area. Mr. MASON advised SA GRAFF that
many different organizations have used these installations and
that no guns are permitted on the premises and that no one
staying on the premises’is allowed to drink intoxicating beverag

Mr. MASON advised that JEFF FORT, contacted him
approximately in the middle of April, requesting that the
Blacksime Rangers be allowed to use the installations at the
Pleasant Valley Farm for a couple of days in May. Mr. MASON
stated that two dates were arranged and that FORT and approximat

twenty to twenty-five other young Negroes appeared

at instant farm on May 14, and departed on May 16,
during which time they played basketball, fished,

and helped build one of the buildings that is in the
process of expanding the farm. Mr. MASON stated that
Mr. FORT advised him that the Rangers belong to a
youth gcsnaction group and more or less are sponsored
by the YMCA, Mr, MASON also advised that these indi-
viduals acted in a normal way and in fact, thdr
quarters were spick and span when they departed on
the 16th.

According to Mr. MASON, JEFF FORT, inquired
about returning to Pleasant Valley Farm in the fall
at which time the Rangers would help finish hina
building being worked on. ;

EARL DOTY, a confidential sourcd in the
Chicago Office, advised on June 7, 1968, that the
Rangers, to the best of his knowledge, were at the

Pleasant Valley Farm located just outside of Woodstock,

Illinois, during the middle of May for a couple of
days, for relaxation. Mr. DOTY also advised that
his organization, Youth Action, took JEFF FORT and
more or less twenty-one of the Blackstone Rangers to
Pleasant Valley Farm, Tuesday and Wednesday, Amy 4,
and 5, 1968, in an effort to get them away from the
city to a more pleasant atmosphere and to sit down
and talk with them and discuss problems which face
the Rangers and south side communitees and in an
effort to stop the shooting and killing of inocent
youths on Chicago's south side.

Mr. DOTY also advised that EUGENE HAZRSsSON
who had been convicted for solicitation for murder,
is now out on bond and is to re-@ppear in court on the
18th of this month to be sentened

Hee i , BEECH eae ——

Until the middle of the Summer of 1967, ROSE }

was a member of the Blackstone Rangers, hereinafter

. _ called the Rangers, a Negro youth gang on the South Side
of Chicago. At that time he held the position of "War
Lord" which was the third highest in the chain of command,
The two leaders who, were above him were EUGENE* “HAIRSTON,
aka "Bull",and JEFF\.FORT, aka "Ahge)s" ROSE also supplied
the fiames of eighteen other main members of the organiza-
tion, which he said then had a membership of about 6,000.
He said there are Rangers in Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, and Detroit, but they are independent organiza-
tions and there are no national dues involved.

- ROSE stated money had been donated to the Rangers

by "Youth Job, Urban League, Catholic School Board, and TWO,"

At one time he saw $29,000 in "JEFF's mother's house," which .

money came from dues and protection money collected from { &

businessmen, The money was used for bond money and guns 1 q

which were purchased from people on the street and gun shops «|
“*. in the suburbs, He estimated they could muster about 200 | §
. ean if necessary,

5 ROSE said at one time they had about fifteen hand |
i: grenades, both smoke and fragmentation types, which GENE ‘
hae bought from a fellow named BOB, He had also seen about -

seven 30-30 carbines, The ultimate aim of the Rangers, he
- added, was "to have a city full of Blackstone Rangers, JEFF
and BULL said they would cause a riot and then make demands,"

which demands would be jobs, playgrounds, and building a,
.renewal, : Pa
: ; - te
‘ROSE/further stated that FORT, HAIRSTON, ,LAWMAR..~- pee .
, BELL, BERNARD ’GREEN and EDDIE~BEY, all Ranger | members, have -" ~
‘traveled to Philadelphia, Michigan, and California, but “he

did not know who they contacted except "KARENGA in California,"
He said that in the past he has seen HAIRSTON or FORT meet
with DICK GREGORY, KARENGA, and STOKELY CARMICHAEL,

. In connection with dope activities, he said at~-
one time he had "a few hustlers" working for him and that
PAE one JIMMY LEE-STRAUDER, a dope peddler, wanted the approval
aN ¢ of HAIRSTON to allow his peddlers a free hand in the area,
ni but he refused because of the crime syndicate, From con-
versation he heard from others, ROSE thinks some Rangers
may have killed STRAUDER.

With respect to weapons possibly hidden in the
Ranger Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, 6400
South Kimbark Street, Chicago, he said he had seen a few
hand grenades hidden in a piano in the Assistant Pastor's
office and that a false ceiling in the balcony in the gym
and a tunnel under the church had been used.

ROSE further stated that the Disciples, another
Negro South Side youth gang, at one time stole some guns
from a train car and kept them in a church at 74th Street
and Maryland Ave., Chicago.

He stated that a riot in the downtown area of
Chicago With looting and fires was discussed by the Rangers
for 8/67, It was proposed that the Vice Lords, another
youth gang, would come from the north, the Puerto Ricans from
the west, and armed Rangers from the south and east, He
said that during the discussion, Rev, JOHN FRY, W/M, Pastor
of the church, "was there for his two cents and then would
leave." ROSE said that he talked them out of it because he
thought the Army would surround them and that would be the
end of the Rangers,

In connection with possible activity at the 1968 {
Democratic Convention, ROSE said he had seen KARENGA and
some people he was told were from Detroit talking with FORT

‘and HAIRSTON, but he did not state the nature of their con-

NW 55258

versation, He said, "The Tigers of the Sun (black nationalists) |.
are with DICK GREGORY,."" He added that MARTIN LUTHER KING

would be in Chicago and would lead marches and would block i
all routes to the Amphitheatre, He did not think the Rangers :
had been committed to anyone but a lot of money had been offered:
to them for help this summer, i

He further stated that when the Rangers made an
agreement with the Chicago PD and Agents of the U.S. Treasury
Dept. to surrender their guns, they turned in all rusty,
non-operating guns and zip guns made for this purpose, but
the working guns were kept. He said this was HAIRSTON's
and FORT's idea and Rev, FRY agreed with them, He said Rev.
FRY hid him in the church on one occasion to escape arrest
when police raided the church and arrested others,

Docld:32989668 Page 162 7 E



CG 157-1148 : ' ia
* CG 157-1258

ROSE stated he does not know what power, if any,
directs Rev, FRY, and he knows of no direct connection
between the Rangers and the black nationalists or the CP.

The aforementioned officers stated that they cannot
vouch for the veracity of ROSE or the accuracy of his infor-
mation, ROSE said that his lifé was in danger from the
Rangers and they believe much of the information he furnished
was supposition in that he was scared and gave answers to
questions when he did not know the answers, ROSE was unable
to give names or any details regarding persons who allegedly"
offered the Rangers money for help this summer and they think
ROSE is guessing regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING's proposed
summer activities as hereinbefore stated, ROSE was unable
to state the purpose of HAIRSTON's meeting with KARENGA or
others, The officers stated they have never heard of an
organization called the Tigers of the Sun although they have
been familiar with youth gang activities in Chicago for many
years.

In connection with ROSE's statement regarding a
theft of guns for the Disciples, they said that this rumor
occurred about three years ago and the church at 74th and
Maryland was searched by police and no guns were found,
Furthermore, no theft of guns from a train car was ever
verified, Concerning guns allegedly hidden in the Rangers

- Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, they stated

> NW 55258

that about two years ago it was common knowledge that some
guns were there and the police raided the church and obtained
about forty guns, At that time, Rev.FRY said he was keeping
the guns to prevent the Rangers from using them and charged

‘police harassment,

In any event, they stated, ROSE has been out of
the Rangers since 8/67 and is in no position to furnish
accurate, current information, ROSE has fled Chicago and
they do not know his present whereabouts. At the present
time HAIRSTON and FORT are incarceratéd awaiting trial on
@ murder charge and ROSE said he was ordered killed to keep
him from trying to take over command of the Rangers in
their absence, They added that Rev. FRY has no control
over the Rangers especially since CHARLES EDWARD BEY took
over as their leader.

CG@ 157-1258

They stated they learned from another source that
the attorney's fees for HAIRSTON and FORT are being paid by
the Kettering Foundation.

It was their opinion that the Rangers and other
youth gangs in Chicago will not riot this summer if they
continue to receive money from the Poverty Program throug!

‘Unit, Chicago PD, stated that the information in the newspaper
. article regarding narcotics and the obtaining of guns in the

suburbs is possibly true, He added, however, that the

- statements regarding mounted 105 millimeter guns is unbelievable.
He stated that the pilice dept. is unable to state whether the
statements about the communists are true or not but it should
be kept in mind that ROSE is a former gang member and has been
a dealer in narcotics and a possible user,

In connection with the tape of the interview with
ROSE as described in the article, Lt, BUCKNEY said the tape
has been given to the Office of Chicago Mayor RICHARD DALEY.
He said the Chief Investigator of the McClellan Committee
(Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations) was allowed to
hear the tape but he does not know if he was given a copy.
BUCKNEY stated he does not know who released the information
to the "Chicago Tribune" but that it appeared only in one
early edition and was then undoubtedly stopped because of
its uncorroborated and inflammatory nature,

On 3/18/68 Sgt, GARLAND DAVIS, Youth Division,
Chicago PD, advised that the information in said newspaper
article is, in his opinion, a figment of ROSE's imagaina-
tion, He said ROSE, according to police information, had
been marked for death by the gang and, therefore, he was
looking for help and protection and gave information that
he believed the police wanted to hear, DAVIS said there
has been no information developed by police sources to
substantiate ROSE's information, DAVIS is in the position
of correlating all information developed by Chicago PD con-
‘eerning all phases of youth gang activity.

With respect to the inability and disinclination
of the Blackstone Rangers to partake in any city-wide or
even area-wide disturbances in cooperation with other gangs
or black nationalists, the Bureau's attention is directed
to CGairtel and LHM 2/15/68 entitled, "BLACKSTONE RANGERS;
RM and YOUTH GANG VIOLENCE; RM." Said.LHM states in part
that reliable confidential sources of the Chicago Office
and sources of the Chicago PD, all of whom are well acquainted
with gang activities, stated the Blackstone Rangers are pre-
sently disorganized due to the incarceration of their top
leaders on a variety of criminal charges and said sources
have heard no information or indication that the Rangers
or any other youth gang is attempting to organize other
gangs for the purpose of violence,

Said sources stated that the chief gang concern

is the protection of their own gang territory and as a
‘result most gang violence has not been directed at the
community, white or Negro, but has resulted over other

gang incursions into their territory and recruitment attempts
of other gangs, Specifically, the Blackstone Rangers are
not known as black nationalists in outlook although some
individual members do listen to black nationalist talk and
may be susceptible to their literature,

Furthermore, the Blackstone Rangers have an
Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) funded program of
dropout education currently in progress through TWO and
are not likely to jeopardize this grant totalling nearly
‘a million dollars, The best estimate of their membership
from sources is that some 1,500 youths owe allegiance of
one degree or another to the Rangers,

Additionally, there is no information available or
developed by sources of the Chicago Office which would tend in
any way to substantiate or corroborate the major allegations
made by ROSE in his statements to police, Specifically, this is
in reference to the alleged riot in Chicago's Loop in 8/67, or
the information reflecting that people with "funny sounding .
names..-..from Russia", had offered the Rangers jeeps with
105 (millimeter) ccanons mounted thereon.

7 As Sergeant DAVIS, above, has stated in a discussion

_ and analysis of the information provided by ROSE, his background
character and past record must be taken into account. He is a
long-time youth gang member, does not operate on a commonly
accepted level of truth, and as with most gang leaders, has

. developed the ability to "con" to a fine degree,

The Chicago Police Department has frequently received
the allegation concerning handgrenades, as an example, and have
established to their satisfaction that there are not, and have
not been such explosives in the Rangers' possession. The closest
the Chicago Police have come to such was a dummy grenade, in
the raid on the First Presbyterian Church, in 1966.

In connection with ROSE, it should be noted he is

reportedly out of Chicago at present, in hiding, with his
“" whereabouts unknown to the Police Department. The tape recording

of the interview with ROSE is currently in possession of the
office of Mayor DALEY. Chicago feels that until such time as
this tape is again in possession of the Police Department, no
effort should be made to obtain it. Likewise, no interview with
ROSE is at this point feasable or deemed desirable by Chicago,
Chicago will, however, -aggressively pursue this matter
with the Police Department, and with sources of this office
who are knowledgeable in such matters. Any subsequent pertinent
information developed will be provided the Bureau,

Chicago is not making any local dissemination of the
above information, due to its nature and that of the source,

both of which in themselves tend to reflect so adversely on its
credability.

who is close to the White House and the McClellen Committee,
are aware of its existence.

Reference is made to memorandum from S. B. Donahoe ; .’.
to Mr. C. D. DeLoach dated February 13, 1968, captioned (ital
"Blackstone Rangers, Racial Matters," advising of a request
fron MESv Mildred Stegall at the White House for information
concerning the validity of an allegation that the Blackstone
Rangers, a Negro youth gang in Chicago, Illinois, had worked

out agreements with other gangs to "bring havoc"! to Chicago. oe

An inquiry by the Chicago Office failed to 7
develop any information to substantiate the allegation. In
fact, the Bureau sources in Chicago thought it highly

{unlikely that these undisciplined youths would consent to
influence or direction from another gang. :

The Chicago Police Department was also consulted
. during the inquiry and stated categorically that they have
developed no information indicating that the Blackstone
Rangers, or any other youth gang, are attempting to cooperate -
through "interlocking directorates" to "bring havoc"! to
Chicago. All these sources consider such gang activity
highly unlikely and feel that such cooperation runs counter
to traditional gang cctivictes gai irrerseng hostility. —

‘"Mubammad Speaks," Vol. 8, No. 41, June 27, 1969,
page 7, set forth an interview of Captain Edward Buckney,
Gang Intelligence Unit (GIU), Police Department, Chicago,
Illinois. The interview set forth Buckney's answers to various
questions about gangs engaged in i on the streets and,-
schoolyards of Chicago.

In recent days, Jeff Fort, President of the Black
“pe Stone Nation, was in contact with officials of the NOI at
Muhammad's Temple No. 2, 5335 South Greenwood, Chicago, and
protested the above article claiming the NOI had joined ranks
with the GIU and the political machinery of Chicago. Fort pro-
claimed the article to be an insult. Fort advised his group

beset their people but added they would not continue to tolerate
alienate the black community from its children.

Fort protested recent articles in "Mubammad Speaks"
tended to hold his group responsible for all gang slayings;
tended to imply his group was worse than the hoodlums; tended

petrate criminal acts on black people.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

“A Chicago Police Department (PD) source advised on
May 28, 1969, a truce had been declared between the Blackstone
Rangers and the Disciples, the two largest youth gangs oper-
ating on Chicago's South Side. Spokesmen for each gang advised
they would discipline their members and reprimand those
ereating any trouble in South Side neighborhoods. Spokesmen
for the gangs were critical of recent pleas by the Cook
County State‘s Attorney in local news media requesting
neighborhood cooperation by citizens in reporting gang
activities.

e Captain Fogerty, Watch Commander, Second PD District,
advised on May 29, 1969, Gregory Green, a Negro male, age 14,
residing at 4120 South Prairie Street, Chicago, was shot and
killed at approximately 11:00 PM on May 28, 1969. The shooting
occurred in the.vicinity of 4000 South Indiana Street.

Captain Fogerty also advised that Edward Payne, Negro
-male, age 16, residing at 4928 East 78th Street, was shot in
the hip in the vicinity of the above killing. This shooting
occurred at approximately the same time as the one noted above.
Payne was in good condition. According to Captain Fogerty, both
were separate incidents. He concluded by saying that both
incidents were believed to be related to youth gang recruiting
drives in the area.

Detective Breen, Area 1, Homicide, Chicago PD, advised
on May 29, 1969, the individuals set forth below were arrested
and. have ‘been charged with the murder of Gregory Green:

BLACKSTONE RANGERS, ALSC KNOT AS
I BLACK P. STONS NATION

A confidential source, who is involved in gathering
intelligence information in the Chicago area, and who is
familiar with youth gang activities in Chicago, provided the
following information to a representative of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation:

The source advised the Blackstone Rangers is a

Negro youth gang operating in a large territory on the south
side of Chicago. This organization is considered as one of
the better organized street gangs in Chicago and because of
much publicity in national news media, this gang has been
given added recruiting power. Because of the apparent
expansion of the Blackstone Rengers they have now endeavored

. to expand to some of the suburban areas to the south of Chicago
and generally use’ the mane of the Black P. Stone Nation, in

. the areas of this current expansion.

Source also advised that many Negro youth clain

a particular purpose when in fact the youth may not be a member.

stone Rangers are being used by adult individuals both white and

Negro, in an attempt to operate quasi-legal business operations
in the Negro communities. Source advise some of these business

operations give. the appearance of having affiliation with
highly unsavory ° individuals.

This source advised that there are continuous
rumors of members of the Blackstone Rangers becoming involved
in many illegal activities such as armed robberies, burglaries,
nd strong-arming. Source advised that from time to time ests
have: been made of individuals involved in such illegal activities
and it has been learned that many of these youth have been
affiliated with the Blackstone Rangers.

Source advised that there appears to be a growing
number of shooting incidents involving members of the Blackstone
R-ngers and the number of firearms in the possession of
Blackstone Ranger-members also seems to be on the increase.

Source advised that the Blackstone Rangers as a
group have from time to €ime endeavored to be involved in
Legal and constructive programs such as youth training in the
theatre and musical events. Source advised that because the
Blackstone Rangers in the pest have had access to considerable
amounts of funds, this has created an atmosphere of competition

. from other youth gangs. This competition seems to be created
so that funding agencies will meke money available so as to

_ prevent further gang activities. This has apparently made
gang recruitment more active and consequently intra-gang fights
‘and. Shootings have been on the increase.

The source advised that the BlackstonRangers
have been affiliated with several churches on the south side
. of Chicago and has access to several church facilities for
their meetings and places of entertainment.

The source advised that some individuals apparently
members of the Blackstone Rengers have in the past several
months been approaching businessmen on the south side of
Chicago suggesting the businessmen "donate" money to assist
the Rangers in preventing violence. Source advised that
few of these events have proven to be prosecutable extortion
cases, however, a suggestion of pressure is created.

Re? BLACKSTONE RMIGERS

'

Source advised that several of the Blackstone
Rangers Have from time to time in the past year been
arrested and some are presently appealing cases in which
they have been fourld guilty.

Source advised that in;the past few months there
appears to have been an indication that the Blackstone
Rangers and other Negro youth gangs in Chicago have
attempted to come to terms on peaceful grounds to
terminate intra-gang killings or they have attcmpted to
negotiate a coalition pact. Source advised thet on at least
one occasion the Black Panther Party (BYP) has made overtures
of friendship with the Blackstone Rangers.

Attached hereto is a cheracterization of the
PP. This source advised, however, that on several occasions
there have been indications of suggested armed vorfare between
“the Blackstone Rangers and the BPP.

The source advised that Blackstone Rangers under
their present structure do not appear to be interested in
any close alliance with any other group and that they
apparently do not have need financially or membership wise
to bargain with any other orgenizations.

. This source advised that the Blackstone Rangers

thas been in existance as a gang in one form or another for

-many years. Currently, however, the gong has been given more of
a_ professional atmosphere, because of the involvement of

old individuals -nd forces not within the confines of the south
side Chicago. This gang more than any other in the Chieago crea
has taken on the more avesome atmosphere than "a mere street
gang.

Re: BLACKSTON: RANGERS
q : ; APPENDIX
BLACK PANTHER PARTY

. According to its official newspaper, the Black Panthér Party
(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

‘ organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the
destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,
BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton
is presently serving a sentence oi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther,’ which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the ©
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following:

’ "Black men.: Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping
is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the
October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "... ]
we will not dissent from Ameriéan Government. We will overthrow it." |

Issues of ''The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations j
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic HEEcnEeD
of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of :
the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
various locations throughout the United States.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party
(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the
destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,
BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton
is presently serving a sentence o! 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-
slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further
describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the
BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary
program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-
sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an
editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which
ends with the following:

: "Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
‘revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. - The only culture worth keeping
-is a,revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!
Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the
October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "... °
we will not dissent [rom American Government, We will overthrow it."

Issues of “The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations
from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic
of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

_ the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck
Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at
* various locations throughout the United States.

it is planned to get sufficient publicity with which to gain
recognition. Source stated that at a meeting held in late
July, 1968, an individual by the name of Joe (last name unknown),
who supposedly represented an unknown "Black Power Group", called
upon the Rangers for their assistance in disrupting Chicago
during the forthcoming convention. Source advised that at a

a , meeting also held late in July, members of the Rangers stated

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

A source, who has furnished reliable information

Rangers will make a fund raising tour of certain large
eities on the East Coast. Source stated it is possible that

effort to raise funds for the Blackstone Rangers.

A second source who has furnished reliable infor-
mation in the past advised on July 12, 1968, that some men-
bers of the Blackstone Rangers are supposedly going to make
a trip to the East Coast in an effort to raise funds for the
Blackstone Rangers organization. This source also advised
that probably the musical group known as "Opportunity Knocks"
will be part of this fund raising group.

A third source, which collects intelligence type
information in the Chicago area, advised on July 12, 1968,
that information has come to them which indicates that some
of the Rangers' leaders will accompany the musical group
mentioned above on a fund raising tour to the East Coast.

Hairston, recognized as leader of the Blackstone Rangers,
would be unavailable Monday and Tuesday, July 15 and 16, 1968,

SA LEROY D, FEDERLE ascertained from a member of the
State Police, at Elgin, Illinois, on June 6, 1968, information
which reflected that the Blackstone Rangers” were using the
Pleasant Valley Farm, located in Mc Henry County for military
training. State Police source advised that he observed the
Blackstone Rangers training at instant farm on May 15, 1968.

SA JOSEPH B, GRAFF, RA, Waukegan, Illinois, advised
on June 7, 1968, that JAMES MASON, Director of the Pleasant
Valley Farm advised on this date that instant farm is operated
by the Gommunity Renewal Society, located at 116 South Michigan
and is primarily for the purpose and use for underprivileged
children in the Chicago area. Mr. MASON advised SA GRAFF that
many different organizations have used these installations and
that no guns are permitted on the premises and that no one
staying on the premises is allowed to drink intoxicating beverages.

Mr. MASON advised that JEFF FORT, contacted him
approximately in the middle of April, requesting that the
Blackstme Rangers be allowed to use the installations at the
Pleasant Valley Farm for a couple of days in May. Mr. MASON
stated that two dates were arranged and that FORT and approximately

twenty to twenty-five other young Negroes appeared

at instant farm on May 14, and departed oh May 16,
during which time they played basketball, fished,

and helped build one of the buildings that is in the
process of expanding the farm. Mr. MASON stated that
Mr. FORT advised him that the Rangers belong to a
youth gcnaction group and more or less are sponsored
by the YMCA, Mr. MASON also advised that these indi-
viduals acted in a normal way and in fact, thdr
quarters were spick and span when they departed on
the 16th.

According to Mr. MASON, JEFF FORT, inquired
about returning to Pleasant Valley Farm in the fall
at which time the Rangers would help finish the
building being worked on. ‘

EARL DOTY, a confidential sourcd in the
Chicago Office, advised on June 7, 1968, that the
Rangers, to the best of his knowledge, were at the
Pleasant Valley Farm located just outside of Woodstock,
Illinois, during the middle of May for a couple of
days, for relaxation. Mr. DOTY also advised that
his organization, Youth Action, took JEFF FORT and
more or less twenty-one of the Blackstone Rangers to
Pleasant Valley Farm, Tuesday and Wednesday, Kim; 4,
and 5, 1968, in an effort to get them away from the
city to a more pleasant atmosphere and to sit down
and talk with them and discuss problems which face
the Rangers and south side communitees and in an
effort to stop the shooting and killing of inocent
youths on Chicago's south side.

Mr. DOTY also advised that EUGENE HAERSDON
who had been convicted for solicitation for murder,
is now out on bond and is to re-eppear in court on the
18th of this month to be sentenced

. ¢ : 7 : C % Ks on
Until the middle of the Summer of 1967, ROSE
was a member of the Blackstone Rangers, hereinafter
called the Rangers, a Negro youth gang on the South Side
of Chicago. At that time he held the position of "War
Lord" which was the third highest in the chain of command,
The two leaders who, were above him were EUGENE“HAIRSTON,
_ aka "Bull",and JEFF\FORT, aka “Ahgel." ROSE also supplied
the Tames OF eightéén other main members of the organiza~
Pati tion, which he said then had a membership of about 6,000. l| -
He said there are Rangers in Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San yo
Francisco, and Detroit, but they are independent organiza- |
tions and there are no national dues involved. Y ape Jost

- ROSE stated money had been donated to the Rangers
by "Youth Job, Urban League, Catholic School Board, and TWO,"
At one time he saw $29,000 in "JEFF's mother's house," which
money came from dues and protection money collected from :
businessmen. The money was used for bond money and guns |
which were purchased from people on the street and gun shops

‘\. in the suburbs, He betta tat they could muster about 200
i (ve if necessary.

: ROSE said at one time they had about fifteen hand
grenades, both smoke and fragmentation types, which GENE
bought from a fellow named BOB, He had also seen about
seven 30-30 carbines, The ultimate aim of the Rangers, he
added, was “to have a city full of Blackstone Rangers, JEFF
-and BULL said they would cause a riot and then make demands,"

which demands would be jobs, playgrounds, and building *
.renewal,. i La
. ; ‘ROSE/further stated that PORT, HAIRSTON, .LA.MARo~ —» jt.
‘BELL, BERNARD”GREEN and EDDIE“BEY, all Ranger | members, have ~**
raveled to Philadelphia, Michigan, and™ ‘Californi ) but "he

did not know who they contacted except "KARENGA in california. 23
He said that in the past he has seen HAIRSTON or FORT meet
with DICK GREGORY, KARENGA, and STOKELY CARMICHAEL,

. In connection with dope activities, he said at
wie one time he had "a few hustlers" working for him and that
nets one JIMMY LEE“STRAUDER, a dope peddler, wanted the approval

a of HAIRSTON to allow his peddlers a free hand in the area,

‘ put he refused because of the crime syndicate, From con-
versation he heard from others, ROSE thinks some Rangers
may have killed STRAUDER,

With respect to weapons possibly hidden in the
Ranger Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, 6400
South Kimbark Street, Chicago, he said he had seen a few
hand grenades hidden in a piano in the Assistant Pastor's
office and that a false ceiling in the balcony in the gym
and a tunnel under the church had been used,

ROSE further stated that the Disciples, another
Negro South Side youth gang, at one time stole some guns
from a train car and kept them in a church at 74th Street
and Maryland Ave., Chicago,

He stated that a riot in the downtown area of
Chicago with looting and fires was discussed by the Rangers
for 8/67, It was proposed that the Vice Lords, another
youth gang, would come from the north, the Puerto Ricans from
the west, and armed Rangers from the South and east, He
said that during the discussion, Rev, JOHN FRY, W/M, Pastor
of the church, "was there for his two cents and then would
leave." ROSE said that he talked them out of it because he
thought the Army would surround them and that would be the
end of the Rangers,

Democratic Convention, ROSE said he had seen KARENGA and

In connection with possible activity at the 1968
some people he was told were from Detroit talking with FORT |

“and HAIRSTON, but he did not state the nature of their con-

versation, He said, "The Tigers of the Sun (black nationalists)
are with DICK GREGORY." He added that MARTIN LUTHER KING

would be in Chicago and would lead marches and would block |
all routes to the Amphitheatre, He did not think the Rangers
had been committed to anyone but a lot of money had been ofterea|
to them for help this summer,

He further stated that when the Rangers made an
agreement with the Chicago PD and Agents of the U.S. Treasury
Dept, to surrender their guns, they turned in all rusty,
non-operating guns and zip guns made for this purpose, but
the working guns were kept. He said this was HAIRSTON's
and FORT's idea and Rev. FRY agreed with them, He said Rev.
FRY hid him in the church on one occasion to eScape arrest
when police raided the church and arrested others,



NW 55258

CG 157-1148
CG 157-1258

ROSE stated he does not know what power, if any,
directs Rev. FRY, and he knows of no direct connection
between the Rangers and the black nationalists or the CP.

The aforementioned officers stated that they cannot
vouch for the veracity of ROSE or the accuracy of his infor-
mation, ROSE said that his lifé was in danger from the
Rangers and they believe much of the information he furnished
was supposition in that he was scared and gave answers to
questions when he did not know the answers, ROSE was unable

ito give names or any details regarding persons who allegedly
offered the Rangers money for help this summer and they think
ROSE is guessing regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING's proposed
summer activities as hereinbefore stated, ROSE was unable

to state the purpose of HAIRSTON'’s meeting with KARENGA or
others, The officers stated they have never heard of an
organization called the Tigers of the Sun although they have
been familiar with youth gang activities in Chicago for many
years.

In connection with ROSE's statement regarding a
theft of guns for the Disciples, they said that this rumor
occurred about three years ago and the church at 74th and
Maryland was searched by police and no guns were found,
Furthermore, no theft of guns from a train car was ever
verified, Concerning guns allegedly hidden in the Rangers
Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, they stated
that about two years ago it was common knowledge that some
guns were there and the police raided the church and obtained
about forty guns, At that time, Rev.FRY said he was keeping
the guns to prevent the Rangers from using them and charged
‘police harassment,

In any event, they stated, ROSE has been out of
the Rangers since 8/67 and is in no position to furnish
accurate, current information, ROSE has fled Chicago and
they do not know his present whereabouts. At the present
time HAIRSTON and FORT are incarceratéd awaiting trial on
a murder charge and ROSE said he was ordered killed to keep
him from trying to take over command of the Rangers in
their absence, They added that Rev. FRY has no control
over the Rangers especially since CHARLES EDWARD BEY took
over as their leader.

They stated they learned from another source that
the attorney's fees for HAIRSTON and FORT are being paid by
the Kettering Foundation.

It was their opinion that the Rangers and other
youth gangs in Chicago will not riot this summer if they
continue to receive money from the Poverty Program through
TWO.

TWO, mentioned herein, is The Woodlawn Organization,
a Chicago South Side neighborhood rehabilitation organization,

KARENGA is a well known militant black nationalist
from Calif.

The Three Star Edition of the "Chicago Tribune," a2
Chicago daily newspaper, dated 3A0/68, carried an article by
WILLIAM JONES entitled, "Negro Gang Leader Tells Arms Offer,"
The article contains results of a taped interview with ROSE
by Chicago Police and a copy of the article is attached
hereto, i

On 3/15/68 Lt, EDWARD BUCKNEY, Gang Intelligence
Unit, Chicago PD, stated that the information in the newspaper
article regarding narcotics and the obtaining of guns in the
suburbs is possibly true, He added, however, that the
- statements regarding mounted 105 millimeter guns is unbelievable,
He stated that the plice dept. is unable to state whether the
statements about the communists are true or not but it should
be kept in mind that ROSE is a former gang member and has been
a dealer in narcotics and a possible user,

In connection with the tape of the interview with
ROSE as described in the article, Lt. BUCKNEY said the tape
has been given to the Office of Chicago Mayor RICHARD DALEY. :
He said the Chief Investigator of the McClellan Committee
(Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations) was allowed to
hear the tape but he does not know if he was given a copy.
BUCKNEY stated he does not know who released the information
to the "Chicago Tribune" but that it appeared only in one
early edition and was then undoubtedly stopped because of
its uncorroborated and inflammatory nature,

. 4 . ‘

On 3/19/68 Sgt. GARLAND DAVIS, Youth Division,

Chicago PD, advised that the information in sgid newspaper
article is, in his opinion, a figment of ROSE's imagaina-
tion. He said ROSE, according to police information, had
been marked for death by the gang and, therefore, he was
looking for help and protection and gave information that

. he believed the police wanted to hear, DAVIS said there
has been no information developed by police sources to
substantiate ROSE's information, DAVIS is in the position
of correlating all information developed by Chicago PD con-
cerning all phases of youth gang activity.

With respect to the inability and disinclination

. of the Blackstone Rangers to partake in any city-wide or
even area-wide disturbances in cooperation with other gangs
or. black nationalists, the Bureau's attention is directed
to CGairtel and LHM 2/15/68 entitled, "BLACKSTONE RANGERS;
RM and YOUTH GANG VIOLENCE; RM."" Said.LHM states in part
that reliable confidential sources of the Chicago Office
and sources of the Chicago PD, all of whom are well acquainted
with gang activities, stated the Blackstone Rangers are pre~
sently disorganized due to the incarceration of their top
leaders on a variety of criminal charges and said sources
have heard no information or indication that the Rangers

. or any other youth gang is attempting to organize other

gangs for the purpose of violence,

Said sources stated that the chief gang concern
is the protection of their own gang territory and as a
result most gang violence has not been directed at the
community, white or Negro, but has resulted over other

: gang incursions into their territory and recruitment attempts

of other gangs. Specifically, the Blackstone Rangers are
not known as black nationalists in outlook although some
individual members do listen to black nationalist talk and
may be susceptible to their literature,

Furthermore, the Blackstone Rangers have an
Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO} funded program of
dropout education currently in progress through TWO and
are not likely to jeopardize this grant totalling nearly
a million dollars, The best estimate of their membership
from sources is that some 1,500 youths owe allegiance of
one degree or another to the Rangers.

CG 157-1258 i F

Additionally, there is no information available or
developed by sources of the Chicago Office which would tend in
any way to substantiate or corroborate the major allegations
made by ROSE in his statements to police, Specifically, this is
in reference to the alleged riot in Chicago's Loop in 8/67, or
the information reflecting that people with "funny sounding
nameS.o...from Russia", had offered the Rangers jeeps with
105 (millimeter) ccanons mounted thereon.

As Sergeant DAVIS, above, has stated in a discussion
and analysis of the information provided by ROSE, his background
character and past record must be taken into account. He is a
long-time youth gang member, does not operate on a commonly
accepted level of truth, and as with most gang leaders, has
developed the ability to "con" to a fine degree.

The Chicago Police Department has frequently received
the allegation concerning handgrenades, as an example, and have
established to their satisfaction that there are not, and have
not been such explosives in the Rangers' possession. The closest

’ the Chicago Police have come to such was a dummy grenade, in
the raid on the First Presbyterian Church, in 1966,

In connection with ROSE, it should be noted he is

. reportedly out of Chicago at present, in hiding, with his

* whereabouts unknown to the Police Department, The tape recording
of the interview with ROSE is currently in possession of the
office of Mayor DALEY. Chicago feels that until such time as
this tape is again in possession of the Police Department, no
effort should be made to obtain it. Likewise, no interview with
ROSE is at this point feasable or deemed desirable by Chicago,
Chicago will, however, -aggressively pursue this matter
with the Police Department, and with sources of this office
who are knowledgeable in such matters. Any subsequent pertinent
information developed will be provided the Bureau.

Chicago is not making any local dissemination of the
above information, du¢ to its nature and that of the source,
both of which in themselves tend to reflect so adversely on its
credability. :

This information has been set forth for the Bureau
in some detail since there could conceivaiy be inquiries
concerning this matter, noting that the office of Mayor DALEY,
who is close to the White House and the McClellen Committee,
are aware of its existence.

\ Reference is made to memorandum from S. B.* Donahoe
to Mr. C. D. DeLoach dated February 13, 1968, captioned
wBlackst ne Rangers, Racial Matters," advising of a request
from’ MESy Mildred Stegall at the White House for information
concerning the validity of an allegation that the Blackstone
Rangers, a Negro youth gang in Chicago, IllinoiS, had worked 74
out agreements with other gangs to "bring havoc!’ to Chicago. ion

An inquiry by the Chicago Office failed to
develop any information to substantiate the allegation. In
fact, the Bureau sources in Chicago thought it highly
unlikely that these undisciplined youths would consent to
influence or direction from another gang.

The Chicago Police Department was also consulted
during the inquiry and stated categorically that they have
‘. developed no information indicating that the Blackstone
. Rangers, or any other youth gang, are attempting to cooperate -
‘+ ° through “interlocking directorates" to "bring havoc" to
: Chicago, All these sources consider such gang activity
highly unlikely and feel that such cooperation runs counter
to traditional gang Sek aes hostility.
