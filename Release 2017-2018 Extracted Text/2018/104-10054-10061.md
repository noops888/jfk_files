Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. {Unilateral coverage. Fron tre time the Mexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to

exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Fhone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone company

[who was hendled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines

tapped was linited by evalabllity of a listening nost nearby

bo Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help

of Harry Kahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and IDY ISD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices.

These had sub-cripts under IIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

that block. LIVITID was the first base aid it operaied strictly on an

or crimental basis in the early stages. I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden nan" was being releasea to the

public by the Warren Cormission. The photo operators

were moved to another apt

nearby. The property sas sold (under an operational agreenent with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LINITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South.. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican fanilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third phoba

The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Remon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elerentary level at

the America School). Ramon collected the film gettendpit

During 1958,

Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez lateos. During this period, the U.s.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn". One of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former lexi President), acting

for Logez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation.

This

project (LIZWOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest.

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Inmigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he

spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing,

she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.
