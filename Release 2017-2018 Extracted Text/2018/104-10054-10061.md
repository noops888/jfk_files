Sudject: Background on Nexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

{Unitateral; coverege. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

{April 1947) (by Bil] Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to ER,
exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
coasisted of milti line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was be: released to the

public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby, The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LINOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of 2 new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED,

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.’ She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that lie doesn't know

be no problem.‘ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
