1.

On 22 October I called

af the Caribbean Dest

to ask hia what had happered to the drart dispatch which we had

forwarded several weeks before. to Col. King rejarding the above

subject.

After nich scurrying aroad he called back on 23 October

to say that he bad found thht the draft dispatch bad come from

Col. King's office and that they had decided the moment was

Inopportune to send Tichborh to Cuba. I pointed out in no uncertal

terns that I thought they were all vet, that the situation in Cuba

was growlaz nore delicate day by ¿sy, that as "ar as I knew our

Intelligence was not too good in cuss and that 1t did not appear to

me, fron where I sat, that Station Eavans was mating any great

- strides forward 1a trying to Identiry the opposition to Castro.

I

further polated out that the idea had been afflin in principlè

by Col. King before we ever drew up the draft dispatch. I vent on

to re count the succema we had had of

Trith Ferjongo (P) and .

that in vier of the considerable endure wolved in Project AMPATROL

1t would be a good idea to have soneone take an Latinitent look at

the politiçal situation in Cuba before the time came for the project

to be spproved. I went on further to say that he could check with the 24

las regards to the jos that Perlongo had done and that ve

had a rough transcript of the debriefing which, with thel

peruission, I would make available to him.
