Masferrer claimed that his Haiti invasion -

plot was approved by the U. S. Government (varying

‘between thé CIA and the FBI as the approving -

agency). While the CIA approval claim was untrue, :

Agency concern, at the time, centered around the :

possibility of unfavorable publicity and the

Compromise o£ sources and methods if the Agency

was forced to disprove Masferrer's charges in i

“court. A handwritten note in Masferrer's’ file : fe -

revealed that he died in 1975 when his car was’
‘-blown apart by a bomb in Florida. No further -
details regarding his death were contained in
his subject files. Since Masferrer. has never .
been ‘affiliated with thé Agency, despite his
claims, it is believed that Dade County officials
. Should be veferred to the FBI for information
regarding Masferrer. : :

_j regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned
.a"Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

: a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

5. The firsttime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office q

‘was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request t

| sternmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which
:he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in
{Chicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico
jwas for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police
|methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;
land had added that he was investigating Communism in a certain unnamed
1c tral American country.
