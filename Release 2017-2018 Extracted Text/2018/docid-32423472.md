Mr. Johnston. And you retired from the Army as a
Lieutenant Colonel, is that right?

Mr. Hubbard. Right.

Mr. Johnston. With military intelligence?

Mr. Hubbard. Military intelligence.

Mr. Johnston. How long had you served in the Army?

Mr. Hubbard. At the time of my retirement I had 22 years,
six months, 15 days, something like that.

Johnston, And when did you retire?

Hubbard. 31 March 1973.

Johnston. What branch were you in in the Army?

Hubbard. Military Intelligence at the time of my
retirement.

Mr. Johnston. Were you connected with operations
directed at Cuba for Army intelligence?

Mr. Hubbard. Yes.

Mc. Johnston. And would you briefly describe the tine
period you were involved with those operations and the puriws.
of the operations?

Mr. Hubbard, All right. This is fairly approximate.
August of 1962 to December of 1963, I was a member of the

Puerto Rico station, a subordinate element of Detachment A

Senator Schweiker. j What does that mean,’ the three
countries?

Mr. Hubbard. We were broken down into teams. That was my
geographic area of responsibility.

Senator Schweiker. Detachment A meant those three
countires?

Mr. Hubbard. No. Detachment A had a worldwide mission,
very small, very select group at that time, working directly
for the Chief of Staff, the Assistant Chief of Staff for
Intelligence.

Senator Schweiker. Of which, Army?

Mr. Hubbard. Of Army, yes, sir.

Senator Schweiker. Do you know offhand, did this ultina
go up the chain of command to a Lansdale in Operation }

Mr. Hubbard. I understand General Lansdale was bricted
on some of my material. I personally never briefed the
General. I am sure that someone out of the Pentagon, Detachive
A or the ACSI staff passed this information on. I was told

informally General Lansdale had seen some of the reports.

Mr. Johnston. What was your mission from the Puerto Rican

Mr. Hubbard. Insofar as Cuba, we responded to requireme:
we never unilaterally initiated an operation. We responded
to requirements. My first involvement with the Cubans was in
response to a requirement that picked up intelligence rumors
about a frogman operation against a Soviet sugar ship in
Sago La Grande Harbor, Cuba, and which there _ something
unusual about this ship. ‘his was immediately following un
British commander, Crabb, as I recall.it, being «= his body

Escambray, through a period of several weeks and, you know, the

dark meetings andwwhatever.

I was directed-to meet’ one of the leaders of the Second
Front in wiami. We went to a Cuban safe house. There I was
introduced to a leader, Luis Guitterez Menoyo. After some
seven hours of discussion, he agreed to let me interview this
frogman, but I had to agree to go by boat, blindfolded. At
that time I was not permitted to leave and go back and call the
and get permission. I had to make a decision whether to
go or no go. Soi did. 1 agreed. I was blindfolded. We
made a black entry out of Miami, past Immigration and Customs.
They kept me below deck so I couldn't see the compass.

We ended up on a small Island that I determined was
xight off of Andros Island. They had a small base camp in
a former Portuguese sponge fisher village. The only thing
left was the concrete tanks and rodf. They used the roof to
provide cover from aerial surveillance.

I interviewed the frogman, got the stery, came back
some ten days, 12 days later, as I recall, the Washington
community was flapping, where is Hubbard, at this point.
report was favorably received, as I recall, and I was directs
to maintain contact.

I very definitely ha

algo had a feeling he'was not a man to be trusted.” However, he
had a second in command," and I'm not sure of the name now --
Iwas trying to think of it -- Hueget. Ralph was his first
name. He was allegedly a graduate of Georgia Tech architec-
tural school, a very sharp young man, and I dealt primarily
with him because of the language barrier.

I was sent to Puerto Rico station because of French, to
work Haiti, and between French, arm and hand signals, and
English, I could communicate with Cubans.

But working with Hueget, they wanted us to support them,
us being the United States intelligence community.

I should regress. Although I was operating under a
pseudony#, I very definitely let them know that I was military
as opposed to CIA because CIA had had the flap on the Bay of
Pigs. Menoyo had had many of the pecyle the CIA had trained
in the parachute school out on the Bay of Pigs thing, and they
were very bitter, quite bitter. So I let them know that I
was military support. Well, through negotiations, with sapprovi
at the Washington level, we agreed to supply them small
arms, ammunition, rations and medical supplies in exchange fo:
permitting me to organize an intelligence net within their
unit, to send agents into Cuba to develop a net within Cuba.

Tais was progressing quite well. 1 had picked this

Hueget as the team chief, to be the resident agent in Cuba,

'



supplies’en route from Fort Bragg! North’ Carolina, to.Miami.
I advised the Second Front of this. Everyone redeived the
news quite welcomely, In approximately two weeks I got the
word that no, we would no longer support them, to advise them,
and then I was placed in the awkward situation of saying

I told them we cannot support them, but maintain our good
relations.

As a sad note, the night that I advised them of it,
one of the Cubans became a little excited and pulled a knife
and proceeded to rip up a beautiful new sportcoat I had.

Senator Schweiker. Did you yet reimbursed for that?

Mr. Hubbard. No, sir. I filed a voucher, and never
heard about it.

I maintained this contact at a much lower profile.
would have nothing really to do with us sincer we woulé
not support them.

Came up, and again, yentlemen, I do not know the tine
frame, President Kennedy decided that not only would we
support them, but he wanted them stopped, and physically siv,
because I had made two trips out there was the base car
the smaller islands off the coast of Cuba where we had e3tai:
caches and supplies.

well, I.was burned, to use an intelligence térm.

They evacuated my family out of Puerto Rico and I was
evacuated out. I think it was either late Novenber ‘or early
December of '63. I had this one subsequent contact, in” approxi-
mately January.or February of '64 when I was directed to go
to Miami to turn over Hucget to a member of the Miami

team and make a personal introduction.

Senator Schweiker. And who was that contact with, the new

Mr. Hubbard. Yes, sir, and sir, I am not sure, but I
think I turned him over to a Captain Stein, David E, Stein.

Senator Schweiker. Did you have dealings with other
groups than the Second Front of Escambray?

Mr. Hubbard. Not of any significance, sir. That was
primarily my unit. I met the leader of Alpha 66 on a one
time, personal introduction basis, Veciana. I had no dealing
with Alpha 66. There was a condiict between the Second Fro.:
of the Escanbray and the Alpha 66. They were both reeruitans
men, support and money, and there was a rivalry between the
two, each accusing the other of being pro-Castro, but misleas.

Senator Schweiker. That was it?

Mr. Hubbard. That was about it.

Senator Schweiker. Well, who was doing a similar thing to
Alpha 66?

Mr. Hubbard. As I recall, Alpha 66 was the bailiwick of
CIA, but they let Army nibble on the edges at the Miami station
I think Miami had received words of hands off of Alpha 66. Xow
I may be mistaken.

Senator Schweiker. They said it was an Army operation.

Mr, Hubbard. Well, if that is the case, it would go
into the Miami station, and that was commanded by Duke Watli
Junius, J-u-n-i-u-s, Watlington, W-a-t-1-i-n-g-t-o-n.

Senator Schweiker. What was his position at that time?

Mr. Hubbard. He was the station chief, Miami station
for Army.

Senator Schweiker. If it wasn't the CIA, as you thought
it might have been, why do you think it was the CIA station
ahat might have had Alpha 66?

Mr. Hubbard. Well, it would have fallen under his
jurisdiction, geographic responsibility, sir.

Senator Schweiker. Well, I thought, as I understand you, |

Mr. Hubbard. Well, we often had dual coverage of
a country.

Senator Schweiker. Do you remember a person who might have
ised the cryptonym Bishop? that might have had some dealings
with Alpha 66 or Veciana, Morris Bishop?

Mr, Hubbard, No, sir, Most of us at that time, for
security reasons, we knew each other in pseudoname. Very
few of us knew each others' true name. But we had a man whose
true name was Bishop, but that was subsequent, I am reasonabl;
sure.:

Mr. Hubbard. No, sir, he was bald.

Senator Schweiker. Okay.

Does that ring a bell with you on any peripheral contacts
you might have made during this period of time with anybody,
possibly somebody in the arms business supplying arms to the
exiles?

Mr. Hubbard. No, sir, but you mentioned arms. We had
Castro's forint Ambassador to London and Castro's first
Minister of Finance that was my source, Burns, William aurns,

Steamship Line, Puerto Rico.

Senator Schweiker. Lykes?

Darnell, D-a-r-n-e-1-1, a beached captain?

Mr. Hubbard. He was a bona fide ship's captain, but he
was on the beach. ”

Mr. Epstein. Was he working for you, Darnell?

Mr. Hubbard. He was a source of mince. As I recall, he
was born in 1908 in Colorado. He was married to a Cuban
woman, I think perhaps because of health reasens, Lykes
Steamship line took him fFom the ocean-going vessels, and maue
him their Puerto Rican chief. He was in charge of Lykes
Steamship.

Senator Schweiker. How do you spell that?

Mr. Hubbard. Lykes, L~y-k-e-s. It is a large steamship
line hare in the United States.

Senator Schweiker. You're saying it is similar. You are |
not saying it is the same person.

Mr. Hubbard. Yes, sir. The jaw is too square, but
across the eyes, yes, sir. I am not saying that it is, but
that is the only one that I can come up with.

that you met him? In other words, what was he doing there?

Mr. Hubbard. He was spotting and assessing for me.

Alpha 66 or Veciana? 2

Mr. Hubbard. | Sir, he very ‘possibly did.. ‘When Veciana
would come to Puerto Rico, he would definitely contact Darnell.
I think that he stayed at Darnell's on occasion. That I cannot
say for sure, but my belief is he did.

Senator Schweiker. Is he -- do you know where he is
located now?

Mr. Hubbard. No, sir. Yhe latt I know he was in Puerto
Rico, San Juan.

Mr. Epstein, Is there any other name he went under?

Mr. Hubbard. No, sir.

Epstein. Was there a code name that he used?

Me. Hubbard, Well, because of his close involvenent with
the Cuban situation, he was quite disappointed when the United
States policy would not support the guerilla movements anymore,
and especially when they had to police them:up out of the
Caribbean. I was burned on. He thought we were definitely on
the wrong track.

Mr. Epstein. How were you burned on that? How were
you personally burned on that?

Mr, Hubbard. Because I was the only American who had been
to all of the base camps, and it had to come from me.

Mr. Epstein. So you were the guy that was giving the
message.

Mx. Hubbard. I was the guy that drew the map for
President Kennedy, Colonel Boydt, and I believe Mr. McCone

Mr. Epstein, Excuse my ignorance on this, but what I
understand you are saying is that some point a requirement was
levied on you to draw a map of where all the base camps were
that the Cuban exiles were operating out of.

Mr. Hubbard. Yes.

Mr. Epstein. ‘That your understanding is that that map
was supplied to the British?

Mr. Hubbard. It had to be because they knew exactly
where to go from the Bahamas.

Mr. Epstein. And that thereafter the British, upoant’.

Attorney General Kennedy were present, the only two present
