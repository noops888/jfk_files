which is attached. In substance, the cable reflects that
Circa 8 June 1976 a Guatemalan source, with the knowledge of
Guatemalan President EAUGERUD, provided the St
a written report, and a detailed briefing, concerning a plot
to assassinate President LAUGERUD. According to the informa-
tion the plot was to have been carried out on 15 September
1975S; however,’ one of the major conspirators, Jorge Antonio
e" ZIMERI Safie left Guatemala in August 1975 as a result
of an attack upon his, ZIMERI's, life. ZIMERI has been living
in Miami since August 1975.

3. According to the report, the National Liberation
jovement was involved with ZIMERI in the assassination plot
and ZIMERI in turn was involved with two Americans, brothers,
Robert and Gerald Patrick HEMMING. The HEMMING brothers
sted ZIMERI in acquiring arms, among other things, which
were flown to Guatemala in a small aircraft. The report also
claims that ZIMERI has close relations with police officials
in Miami and New Orleans.

NOTE The Station also included
information the Ch _of Station wv had received
fro - on $ June. '  gaid that he
had been providing information on ZIMERI to the
Guatemalan government for the past six months or
so. He claimed that two Americans were involved
with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service

in Mi : w did not mention names but
described one of the-Americans as about six feet
5 four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

. 4. The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends
with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United
States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala?

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-
tial treatment by U. S. authorities whi
permit him to carry firearms, as well as
to purchase arms and ammunition for
shipment to Guatemala?

e. Any information on Robert and Gerald oy
HEMMING?
5. On 19 June 1976 WW wo advised

that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State
Nepartment.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HENNING.

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and
alleged employment, it is apparont that Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
429 22S, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds ,
who is @ notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
Miami, Florida.

8 Gerald Patrick NEMMING is well known to this 3
Office of Security Miami Ficld Office, and JINAVE
Siice ai least the eaily i563's,
psd Glained Agency affiliation when in fact there has be
none. The most. recent incident wherein HENMING cl eds

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his servi

to the Drug Enforcement’ Administration. Gerald Patrick I

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#355 459),

+ aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In

the late 1950's HENMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

Claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Conmunist. Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

9. For. an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HENMING, you are referred to attachments to instunt
memorandun, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 Jun?
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
and-an extract from a book published in early 1976 written hy
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMA The book Coup dite
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John” F. Kenacd
is @ diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Ag
with the assassination of President KENNEDY, One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr, to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penet
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KEN
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA, G.
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
