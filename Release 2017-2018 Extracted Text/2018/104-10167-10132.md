a safehouse oni to make the necessary errengements with JENS ard that SADELLE
wuld bring QDTSAR to Miexi on 29 July 1559. 4

3. On the zorming of 29 July, I informed Mr. Bivard ANRRWS, TeHlS Miexf,
what had texen plese and thet GDCHAR wuld remain this area and I would seke hin
evatiavle to hin et any 2 that he wished. Hr. “SiS said he would ieave ithis
entirely to ne and woul. pare to take the next steps in the I: handiics ‘of
QUCHAR at cy convenience. I siso informed ODENVY end offered ‘then the oppcnuntiy
to neet with QDCHAR. They bed not yet received eny instructions from their Head-
quarters cn this natter exé felt that, since we hed alrcedy conducted an interroget:
they could defer their meeting with <DCHAR until sccetine when he could ve aewe nede
wore easily avaiisole, on ettitude which vas particularly appreciated at this time
and in these circmstences.

9. I then mrenelgns epartuent, virtch fortunately he hed left for my
use, eo the satehouse for  UZAR end SADZLIY, and xotified SADELLY that he could
proceed as pienned on 29 J=1y,_ They arrived in the evening of 29 July without
incident end vere settled 23{ Buns epartnent.

Ot
WO. Mearvatle I ves icfcrned that the Havena Station's plans for movidg

QDUHAR's fently out of Cure had hit a snag in thet. in order to obtain a passport
for the children to leave c:ta, a written statenent from QDCHAR granting his ‘per-
nissicn would te required, The obvicus problen was the risk of confizning

to the Cuben government thet QDCEAR vas in the US, vaich might result in biccking
the fenily Fron leaving Cura. At first it had been thought that this tura of events
would elars GDCZAR, but he escepted the nevs with couplete cala, saying thet ie had
expected this t happen. He also seid he did nct e_ieve that his status vith

the Cuton governcant vould cause then to prevent his family from leaving. ia order
to give this protiea thozo=zi considevstion, however, it was thought cest to:have
Stanley R ZAUKA, who was is contact vitn QDCHAR‘s vire and who had the compiate
infcrnation on ‘he problea es it existed there, cone to Miami for a discussion.

12, ZAMZA arrived on 39 Juiy 1959 in the afternoon. He confirued te us the
problem as it had been p: sly outlined, and said that there seened to bejno
escape fron this requireze=%@. ZA/KA aisc carried with hin a letter to DEAR
fron his wife: in which she stated in effect, thet she did not. think there ves)any
seuse for great elarz and coviousiy shared QDCHAR's own opinion that the government
wuld not act to.prevent her and the children fron Leaving the country notwithstand-
ing QDCHAR's status with the Cuben government. ZA‘KA had also reported that/QDCHAR's
wife vas very mich at eese end did not scen to be very worried avout this es a
preblen. QDCEAR vas inforsed that this wus a decision that he mist make since the
risks were his. It was rather quickly agreed thet ve should proceed with the pre-
paration of a written statesent giving peimission for his wire to obtain the?
necessary docunents to transport the chlidren fron Tuba et any time end to whatever
comtzy she vished which Z2KA covld teke back with hin, q

.12. Weving reached this decision through which the Cutan government vpuld ve
specifically ut on notice that QOCHAR is in the US, taere wos no Longer eny necessity
for holding hia in the safeasuse. I infomed Mr. REIS irmediutely that \2CHAR
would vv presented to thes che next day, 31 July 1959, whereupon he would aspume a
