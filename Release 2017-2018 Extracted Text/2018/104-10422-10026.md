The Ambassador's suspicions, cited above, were fueled
two days later, on November 25,.when Gilberto Nolesco Alvarado-
Ugarte, a-twenty-three year old Nicaraguan national Appéat¢d
telephoned the American Embasssy in Mexico City. He claimed

that on 18 September he saw Lee Oswald receive six thousand

five hundred dollars in meeting inside the Cuban Embassy,
Mexico City. (CIA Docs. IN 68291, 11/26/63) AL¥AtAds/f#/

asked this man where one was located; he was shown through a door

In addition, in late November 1963, CIA Headquarters

received two reports, from a highly sensitive and reliable

source, regarding the concern of Cuban President Dorticos

that Silvia Duran, during her interrogation by Mexican authori-

ties, might have been forced to make a statement that the Cuban

Consulate had piven money to Lee Narvey Oswald. In his reply

to Dorticos, Joaquin Hernandez-Armas, the Cuban Ambassador to

Mexico, stated that there had been no mention of money. (CIA.

A Bit¢H/O/UEAL memorandum, dated November 29, 1963 reveals that
OYN¢AZ CIA on November, 28 had advised Sam Papich of the FBI that
the CIA was not yet prepared to turn Alvarado over to the Mexicans.
Acting on instructions from Richard Helms, O/WédZ the Agency in-
formed Papich that the CIA considered it the FBI's responsibility
to decide whether Alvarado would be turned over to the Mexicans.
Papich responded that he believed the responsibility was the CIA's.
Papich,after consultation with his superiors, informed @/W¢A1 his
Agency contact that the FBI had officially decided that Alvarado
would be released to the Mexicans for interrogation and poly-
graphing. @/¥édzZ CIA later informed Papich that the CIA was imme-
diately complying with the FBI instructions. (CIA Doc. @/M¢AZ

There is no place in either cable that
indicates that the person described in
paragraphs5 and paragraph 9 are one and
the same. Nor is it clear that the per-
son seated at AZCUE's desk was the one

which would be the preceding cable IN
69127, the writer should have cited IN
68376, 11/26/63.
