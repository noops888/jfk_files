l. According to the New York Times for 10 December,
the FBI report on the assassination of President Kennedy
categorically states that Lee Harvey Oswald was the
assassin, that he acted alone, and that there is no evi-
dence to indicate that he was the agent of aay foreign
government, These disclosures presumably eliminate the
possibility of further confrontations with Hr. Robert
Slusser, .In the event that Mr, Slusser continues to
insist that the President was murdered by the Sovist se-
cret police, the following additional negative indications
and observations may be of some value.

2. Loag standing KGB practice generally forbids _
agents serving outside the USSR to have any contact with
@omestic communist parties or with Soviet embassies or
consulates. This prohibition, designed to reduce the
possibilities of compromise to a minimum, is probably most
stringeatly applied to agents op extremely sensitive mis-
sions, Yet Oswald blazed a trail to the Soviets which was
a mile wide, He corresponded with the national headquarters
of the Communist Party USA--appareatly with some reguiar~
ity~--and visited the Seviet Consulate in Mexico City. In
addition to his well-known leftist political activities,

be also subscribed to the Daily Worker and a Trotskyite :
publication, allegedly received newspapers from the Sov-
iet Union, and asked last June that his ae be.

re-validated for travel ‘to the USSR. :

3. Certain facets of Oswald's activities in the

: USSR also argué strongly that the KGB would never. have.
i recruited him for a mission of any kind.. First, there:..
i is no doubt that Oswald was debriefed by the secret

: police shortly after his arrival in Moscow. They were ,

1 interested in him not only because he was a political ..
os defector, but also because be boasted publicly--in the

i Embassy on 31 October 1959--that he intended to tell ~:_
the Soviets “everything he knew" sbout Marine Corps
radar installations on the West Coast. / According to 7
Oswald's former commanding officer, this included the...
locations of all radar units and their secret call signs,
authentication codes and radio frequencies—all of which -
knowledge was grist for the Soviet intelligence mill, ©
Given the XGB penchant for keeping its “illegals” under
the deepest possible cover, however,/it is extremely ~~~:
unlikely that Oswald--with his Russian wife—was even
: seriously considered for subsequent repatriation to the
k United States.as 2 XGB asset. As a re-defector from
i the USSR he would immediately be suspect and thus under
surveillance by the FBI, Furthermore, any indication ~
that he had made good on his boast about the radars
could easily lead to arrest and indictment on a charge
of treason. —

4. Secondly, Soviet “executive action” agents
(assassins, saboteurs and terrorists) are carefully
selected by the KGB and specifically trained for their
‘missions, Oswald very probably ruled himself out of
any consideration for this kind of operation, On
14 November 1959, Moscow refused his request for Sov-
iet citizenship.; Shortly thereafter, he became des-
pendent and reportedly attempted to kill himself by
Slashing his wrists. Even if the KGB bad not earlier
noted signs of mental aberrations, the suicide try pre-

' sumably furnished convincing evidence that Cswald was
not agent material.

3 5. Oswald's activities on a Dallas rifle range on
i 17 November are of some interest both as circumstantial
; evidence of prior planning to assassinate the President
and as one more negative indication of XGB involvement.

Oswald was firing at a ravuge of 100 yards, He was assigned
to target nusber 8, but according to witnesses, was actu-
ally firing at targets 7, 8, and 9. . He was thus firing
through an are of approximately 15 degrees and obviously

~~ seems. to have been simulating fire at a moving target.

It is, of course, most unlikely that a KGB agent on an
executive. action mission would be permitted (or would
permit himself) to practice firing under such obvious and
public circumstances.

6, The evidence presently available to us seems |
fairly conclusively to rule out. any Soviet involvement in
the President's assassination, There are, however,
several rather fascinating inconsistencies, loose ends
and unanswered questions about Oswald. Some, if not all,

. May be treated in the FBI report. Pending its publica-

tion, they are listed below for whatever they may be worth..
: c

a) In an interview last August, Oswald stated
that his father-in-law was a Soviet army colonel who
taught him to drink vodka when he came to court Marina,
After the assassination, however, Mrs. Ruth Paine (sone-
time Oswald frfend and landlady) stated that Marina's
father, a colonel, had died when Marina was an infant,

bd) To the tine of some $437, the US picked

-up the tab for Cseald’s return to this country, This

loan was repaid between October 1962 and January 1963.
During this period, Oswald was earning $50 per week,
Thus, over half of his total earnings went to the govern-
ment and he supported himself, his wife and child on
somewhat less than $25 weekly. His rent at that time
was $59 per month, The possibility that he received out-
side help in repaying the government eben hasnnot
been raised in the press.

c) In contrast to the letters Oswald wrote
to his mother, Governor Connally and Senator Tower, his
letters to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee are rather
surprisingly literate. They do not appear to contain
his frequent misspellings and ungrammatical language.
There have been no suggestions that he received help in
framing the letters, and he. told the FPCC that he was
financing his activities on its behalf out of his own
pocket.

4) Theres is increasing evidence that Cswald-
aud his wife were not happily married. She. was well-

. liked aad be was unpopular. She seemed genuinely fond”

of the United States, did not share his anti-Anserican i
views and sometimes spoke of the hard life in the Sov-_—
iet Usion. Oswald resented her friends and beat her

ap on at least one occasion, Since he. could aot have... |
planned the assassination of the President prior to

26 September--when the Dallas trip was announced-—could

- 4t be that his application for a passport (without. one |

for Karina) on 24 June, his application for a Nexican
visa on 17 September and his trip to Hexico City on
26 September simply indicate that he planned to desert
his wife and seek refuge in the Sevriet Union? :

e) Despite Mrs, Paine’s testimony that
Oswald could aot drive, witnesses. said he drove himself
to the Dallas rifle range on one of his visits. He was
driven there by an unidentified man on his other trip.
One witness also clains that two nen were involved in the
attempt-—-evideatly by Cswald--to shoot General Walker
last April.
