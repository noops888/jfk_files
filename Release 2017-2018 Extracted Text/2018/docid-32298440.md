within the past month or two, he had a conversation with

always give's MANNARINO an honest. count. ZERVIS further

stated that HAJADAKOS has told him that he and JOHNNY

member of the. Internal Revenue Service came to the New

Kensington Police Station and notified him that a raiding

party was in New Kensington at that time and that they

could not be trusted and according to ZERVIS, ZELOYLE

over this issue but wished to point out that there appears

to be some ill feeling beginning to grow between

them….

found almost any day at the dice tables in New Kensington

where he generally spends most of his day looking out

for the MANNARINOS' interest from about 1:00 in the

trusted lieutenant who will someday take GABRIEL MANNARINO'S

the FBI or any other law enforcement agency in any matter

under Investigation and under no circumstances would he

discuss SAMUEL or GABRIEL MANNARINO whom he indicated he

had known since childhood.
