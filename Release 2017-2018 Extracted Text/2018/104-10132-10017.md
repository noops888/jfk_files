leader of the IRO Camp at Samar with pro-Soviet propaganda, and to
have worked with a number of other pro-Soviet internees in the camp
to Sovietize the Russian refugees 4nterned there. According to a
' report dated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was believed to be a :
Soviet agent. (The report noted that thig information originated

had proven unreliable; and that the reliability of this particular
information had not been determined.) :

: However this may be, it appears that there could be much truth
in the allegationse Information in Security files reflects that
ORLOFF very possibly 18 identical with a "Count OR of the
Russian Committes"s (apparently a committe of PAdho assisted
the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing  -
TRO employment for ene Bogdana OTTAI, & possible Soviet agent in ..
Paris who was Living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSIIEV, —
who was believed t%o be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence
Service. "Count ORLOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into
the United States. ‘Alexander S. ORLOFF and "Count ORLOFF" may well
be identical with Alexander ORLOFF, DI~2881, a highly suspect
4ndividual of Russian birth, and a former AMTORG employee who was
security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter jndividual, per
a 1943 OSS investigation, was inown ag "The Count".

According to the Staff C memorandum , 4 report from the FeI
dated 1) August 1953 indicated that a source of unknown reliability
atated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a pook store as @
possible cover in Mentsin, Chine, acted as a paid informer of
the Japanese during ‘World Wer IT; and was 8 paid informer of Ue Se

Intelligence after the War. With the assistance of the
American Military Goverrment in Jsingtao, China, he became Chairman
of the Russian Immigrant Society in Tsingtao in 1948. There seems
gmall doubt thet this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor Ne
KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor Pp. KAMKIN who was formerly head
of the Russian Immigrant ‘Association in Tsingtao, China, accord=
ing to his friend SAPELKIN, as reported in Hong Kong Dispatch
#402. Note that Victor Ne KAMKIN was in charge of a Russian
Publishing House 4n China known as Nashe Zpanie; and that the
branch store Subject dntended to open in ‘Ean Francisco (and may
have opened) was also to be called Znarie (this work in Russian

means "Knowledge")«
