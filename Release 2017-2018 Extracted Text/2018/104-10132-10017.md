"RODINA" (LA PATRIE), which 18 dietributed In various languages

and 1s pelled in sealed envelopes, has been forbidden dietribution

Security files reflect that in April 1957 the FBI advised that

nature in the files of this Bureau concerning the subject of your

It was advised orally that the Bureau was using KAMKIN

as a source.

According to an undated blind memorandum (possibly a Staff C

A LSA Wine memorandua), Nina SAPELKIN 18 Elena KAMKIN's sister and as of

EAKi ViTOrs 195] was living with the KAMKINS In Tennesseo. Nina SAPELKIN was

From 1947 to 1949 he stated that he was the owner of

the "Anchor Printing Shop" in which the "North China Marine"

cortised publiostion in Isingtao, China. The KANKINs came to

the United States In 1949 arriving in San Francisco in Karche

As of 1957 KANKIN was being woed on an unclassified basis by

the CIA Ilbrary asa publications procurement channel. It 18, of

course, possible that Subjeot's interest in "RODINA" is on behalf

of this agency®

The other book stores Involved in the report to the French

Desk were the well known Cormunist "Four Continents Book Store",

(MS-2000), "Imported Publications and Producta" (MS-2001-I) and

opon a branch book store in San Francisco to be operated by Se

SAPFIKIN. The store was to be called Zane,

Russian Book Store,

DAVIDOF, was the subject of an Fil Record Check Request In Hay

1955• (The wife Nina, per the check sheet, resided at houte

According to & 1955 RI check conducted on one Alexander So

1+68

ORIOFF for G2, & report of 17 May 1950 advised that ORLOFF (who

had bean described as an "Old Soviet worker") was closely associated

with Verdamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN, an alleged Soviet agent at

the IRO Camp at Samar, P. I. As reported above, Mrs, KANKIN' &

sister Nine and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacusted to Samar»

Po I., fror shanghai under IRO auspices in April 1949.

Ventanin Vasillevitch SAPELKIN's friend ORIOFF, according to

a report of 8 April 1950, was alleged to have influenced a district

loader of the IRO Canp at Samar with pro-Soviot propaganda, and to

have worked with a number of other pro-soviet internees in the camp

to Sovietize the Russian refugees interned there.

According to a

report dated 5 May 1950, ORIOFF allegedly was believed to be a

Soviet agent. (The report noted that this information originated

In the IRO Camp in Sanar; that much Information originating there

had proven unrellable; and that the reliability of this particular

Information had not been deteruined.)

SENRE

However this may be, It appears that there could be much truth

in the allogations. Information In Security files roflects that

ORlOrr very possibly 1o identioal with a "Count ORLOFF of the

Russian Connittoe", (apparently a connittes of TRO), Who assisted

the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing

IRO employment for pne Bogdana OTTAI, a poseible Soviet agent in

Paris who was living with and was engaged to marry k1r1I VASSILEV,

who was believed to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence

Service•

"Count ORIOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into

the United States.

Alexander S. ORIOFF and "Count ORIOFF" may well

be Identical with Alexander ORIOFF, DI 2881, a highly suspect

Individual of Russian birth, and a formar AMTORG employee who was

security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter individual, per

a 1943 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count".

A December 195L Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported

that unevaluated Information dated 1 June 1948 Indicated that one

Victor No KAMKIN was Involved in a money printing transaction with

the Japarase; in which he used the machinery of the Chihli Prees

in Tientsin to facilitate the counterfitting. The source of this

Information had pointed out the possibility that Victor No KAMKIN

might be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was named

as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKOFF

was not identified.) The memorandum advised that according to a

report dated 1 June 1948 from a U. S, Naval Attache, Nanking, to

the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. N. KAMKIN was a printer and

publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian

Publishing House) known as Nashe ZNANIE. He was closely associated

with Bernard S. ROGARD of the thihl! Press, who in turn was

associated with alloged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASINo

According to the Staff C memorandum, a report from the FBI

dated I4 August 1953 indicated that a source of unknown reliability

stated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a

possible cover in Tientsin, China, acted as a paid Informer of

the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid Informer of U. So

Army Intelligence after the War.

With the assistance of the

Amerloan Military Goversment 1n Isingtao, China, he becane Chairman

of the Fussian Immigrant Society in Tsingtao in 1948. There seens

small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN 1s Identical with Victor Nº

KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head

of the Russian Immigrant Association in Isingtao, Chine, accord-

1ng to his friend SAPELKIN, as reported in Hong Kong Dispatch

#402. Note that Victor N. KAMKIN wras in charge of a Russian

hare opened was also to be called Znande (this work in Russian

means "Knowledge")
