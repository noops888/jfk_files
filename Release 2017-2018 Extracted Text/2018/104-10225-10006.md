Grade GS-13, Daniel Flores

oe Mr. Daniel Flores was recently assigned to OTR as ani
operations instructor to ‘capitalize on his fine operational
record which he developed during his two field assignments in *
Jand in and his most recent
operational assignment with LA/COG. His overall performance
has clearly been characterized by exceptional proficiency and
he has been rated by his most recent supervisor’ ds "outstanding"
for his kandling of a sensitive icase and his development:
and pursait of eee erro So Mr. Flores has definite
growth potential and clearly mects or exceeds the criteria for
promotics to Grade GS-13, a promotion which is most strongly
recommended.

2. uring the past year Mr, Flores was responsible for

handling 3 very sensitive, and asset. fe
This asset is probably one of the “messiest and disorganized Pp
individuals" with whom a case officer in this Agency has had
to conten4. However, Mr. Flores.clearly demonstrated his fine
handling abilities: in his manipulation and exploitation of this
agent. 4s 4 result of his guidance and his ability to effectively

- debrief this person, Mr. Flores was able to muke this asset

one of our most productive sources. During the last
year this source lon subject matter which

often commanded attention at the highest levels of our government.

3. Mr. Flores has shown a remarkable growth potential
during the last year. He is determined, persistent, serious,
and comacedably ‘aggressive. He is mature, self-assured, and
his operations] decisions are sound. His managerial skills are

- in keeping with his operational potential, He was often called

upon in the last twelve months to act as Chief of his section,
a GS-14 position. He demonstrated sound Ue pabats qualities
by stimulating interest and enthusiasm in his staff. Mis
operational programs were aggressive and imaginative.

Mr. Flores’ supervisory talents combined with his excellent

professional skills portend a continuing and successful career : 5

in this Agency.
4. While assigned to LA/COG, Mr. Flores was involved

in the spotting, assessing, eventually 7
pitching oho was the ina jenn

Latin American country. The recrultment pitch was not successful
but the details of this operation were handled in the most
professional manner. Mr. Flores developed more leads’ to
and of Jduring this period than. any other
LA/COG operations officer. He has native fluency ‘in Spanish and
feels "at home" operating in the ficld. “While in LA/COG

Mr. Flores was called upon to do_a considerable amount of TDY 7
travel since he was-on. call, to meet. his asset anytime, ,
any place whenever the agent -_ yok In addition ae
to these travels, Mr. Flores a lot of traveling seeking H
out and debricfing potential access agents. During this last ¢

year. he clearly demonstrated his ability to function independently

and to assume responsibilities usually reserved for officers

much more senior in grade and experience. :

5. Mr. Flores was assigned in July 1976 to OTR on a
two-year rotational assignment as an operations instructor.
Upon ‘compiction of this assignment, Mr. Flores will return to .
this Civision’ to assume responsibilities, cither at Headquarters
or in the field, commensurate with his demonstrated operational
and managerial talents. In recognition of Mr. Flores’ outstanding
agent handling skills, his overall professional competency, and
his obvious growth potential, it is strongly récommended that
Mr. Flores be promoted to Grade GS-13.

2. Gid SAT training provide you with any concepts or- tools which can be applied
ina practical way to your work problems? To your personal life? Any
examples you care to mention? i

ce the SAT concept into practice will bring forth not only self eatisfication but
ed _-eareer benefits as well, This will also be:very helpful to ma in my pereonal

: 5 Mfe. I can seo now that sore of the concepts will be put to work iimediately.

S. What elements, segments, or aspects of the SAI training were of the most interest 7

oe
or use to you? 1
: The greatest revelation from an operation point of view, was the
aed clarifcation of perhaps an erroncous idea we have about obtaining our int«lligence
I alvaye cperated under the belief that the nost important t:ing in
i.e. the recruitzent of an agent, SAI
rovealad that it is more important to
. firct considered the target's (agente) objectives. Once we do this our chances
(in ay opinion after tay/ng £AI) «success would probably increase by at least
90 per cent, If I were to stress ons point'it would be that more emphasis be
Placed on dealing vith the target's rather than the CO's objectives.

Iam sure that any poopie would be recarrende: few thie training and that all

officers be gin. SAI 0. a prerequisite to their ‘he. _. wuld certainly heip

5... What other components or categories of personnel do you belfeve would bencfit
from SAI training to a degree making it worthwhile for them to receive it?

6. Please comment, if you have any definite opinion, on the duration and pace: of
the training: too long/short? too fast/slow? 4. pace of the course was
exellent. However, adding one or two more days would certainly help in putting
the SAI concepts into practice by the trains hirself, That 4s, perhaps a live
excercise with a person who 4s net avere of the training situation. A trainee _
could be. takked to elicit inforration from an unwitting participent, The use
of videotapes and/or movies wuld help in teeting the trainces perceptiveness
through the course.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

iret WASHINGTON 28, 0. G.

Applicant Information
be Sheet No. 1

To all persons applying for employment
with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant .

|
i
|
i

statue with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant {s not in agreement with the condi-

tions stated below:

General Considerations:

1, The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, S0th
Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the
Agency the responsibility:

a, "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
euch intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies
as relate to the national security;

b. “to make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart
ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the
national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of auch intelligence within the Government . . . 3
d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies, such additional services of common concern aa the National
Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

e, "to perform such other functions and duties related to
intelligence affecting the national security ag the National Security
Council way from time to time direct,"



The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agen=
ey to maintain correcpondingly special employment criteria which aay be
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Gov-
ernment departments and agencies vhich do not have the highly sensitive
responsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows

that the investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance 1s
a time-consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security
checks, includes evaluation of competence, physical and enotional fitness,
and availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may

be offered. This 1s called “clearance” of an applicant.

2, Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance = perhaps something of which the applicant 1a genuinely un-
: avare, perhaps something which only the special employment eriteria of the
i Agency make unacceptable, In any event, adverse findings by the Agency
are conclusive and final co far as the Agency 1s concerned, and no state~
ment of specific reasons io made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency ta not a right upon :
which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which 1s subject to E
full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giv-
ing an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim againzt the‘Agency.
Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearance 1s at the appli-
cant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage
of applicants are not cleared. :

i Statement of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid-
erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considera-

tions.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet Ho. 2.

and to devise a secure and timely method of

approach’ to the individual Quban.

In comparing Mr. Flores’ performance as an operations officer and as a
supervisor, I belicve his performance is somewhat stronger in the former capacity.
Mr. Flores has all the attributes of an-excellent case officer: he is aggressive,
thinks operationally, and is fast on his feet im an operational situation. He is
further aided by his fluency-in Spanish and has on more than one occasion successfully
During his TDY travels, he has i
Tepeatedly demonstrated dedication to the job at hand, willingness to work long
hours, and a flexibility to handle all types of situations. :

Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic when it comes to the paperwork and bureau-— ;
cratic requirements of his position. While he is a good writer, he tends to handle
his written tasks in a hurried mamer and consequently, his work oftentimes requires
review. He is also inclined to take the shorter and easier approach when handling
the paper flow requirements. I mention these points not because they represent
basic shortcomings, but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performance
in his operations officer capacity.

In sum, Mr. Flores is an extremely experienced, competent and well motivated
operations officer. His talent as a “street operator" with a keen sense for the
human target has been amply demonstrated. le has now quite successfully been
introduced to his first supervisory position and proven that he is competent for
assignments of this nature, I believe Mr. Flores is capable of handling positions
of increasing responsibility and should be given the opportunity to do so.

It was with regret that we learned, carly into what turned

for having done an exceptionally fine job in this as

The completion-of-training report was also well organized, and
the questionnaire which asks for an evaluative follow-up from

Continuation of Section D

His professional, no-nonsense handling has already contributed to
highly significant information (a value quotient of 7.0 with one

Xx report) on some of the Agency's current Cuba priorities including
Cuba's negotiating attitude vis-a-vis the U.S.

By his performance, Mr. Flores has demonstrated he is a versatile _
case officer with good operational instincts; he is showing increasi
agress ivene, t of field stations in their

efforts to While he is an excellent agent
handler who gets maximum intelligence production from his assets, he

is less thorough when handling the administrative details involved in
his operations, He needs more supervisory experience, and still tends
to rely excessively on his IAs to search for operational leads and
conduct operational research.

In a very short time, Mr. Flores has become an important factor in

LA/COG's efforts to directly handle'Cuban and to :
expand its recruitment program, His fluent7S i
experience, versatility and ability to
most Latin American countries, make him highly qualified for his present

trying conditions, and good ability to communicate effectively both
orally and in writing. His frequent TDYs demand long and unusual hours,

which he gives ungrudgingly.

Almost immediately after his assignment to LA/COG in March 1974,
Mr. Flores was called upon to handle a sensitive case. The
agent had already been recruited and many of the developmental aspects
of the case had been resolved prior to Mr. Flores’ introduction, but it
still required a Headquarters based case officer to provide the neces-

I concur with the rating officer's comments and performance evalua-
tion. Soon after his arrival at LA/COG, Mr. Flores took over the
handling of a sensitive agent. While the agent's bona fides had already
been established and -his modus operandi determined, considerable ad hoc
judgement and direction were required to continue the agent's motivation
and ensure his viability. Mr. Flores did extremely well in his guidance
of the agent in a series of complicated, extended meetings which took
place in ood, professional tradecraft and sound

judgement were exhibited by Mr. Flores.

activities in Latin America, due largely to Mr. Flores’
professionalisn,

Mr. Flores' current assignment is a combination of
operational and Headquarters desk responsibilities, the
latter calling for the support of field stations in their
efforts to develop individual Cuban recruitment programs,
His extended TDYs have understandably prevented Mr. Flores
(from devoting much time to his desk responsibilities and it
is somewhat difficult to judge his performance as a desk
officer. He has a good grasp of what needs to be done, and
his handling of specific tasks indicates good managerial
potential, Nevertheless, he does need additional desk
experience, especially in areas which will allow him to use _
his operational ability to support and guide field stations
that are developing Cuban operational programs.

COMMENTS BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL (CONTINUED)

this aspect of his performance was less noteworthy, and it

is believed more attention and research could have been given
to this activity. Mr. Flores writes concisely and well, and
his CI/CE instincts are sharp and true. He can be expected
to turn in a solid desk performance in the future.

Subject's tour in fies ion cut short by the serfous
illness of his daughter. As a result of this illness it was also
necessary for him-to spend the months of December and January on
emergency leave in the United States, returning without his family
in February in order to transfer his ops workload and pack out his
personal effects for PCS transfer to Headquarters on 4 March.

Although the undersigned had the privilege of working with
Subject only briefly, as rating officer he had the advantage of
taking over handling of most of Subject’s cases following the
departure on emergency leave, Thus he was able to observe first
hand and 1m detail the human material with which Subject had worked,
the progress he had made in developing their access and capabilities,
and the respect these agents had for him.

Continuation of Narrative Comments

In carrying this heavy workload, Subject demonstrated that he is

a superfor agent handler, He succeeded tn conveying to these
people a sense of mission and participation which has kept their
morale .and motivation, and hence their production, at a high level.
He also fnsisted upon work and security discipline, with a result
that the record of these agents in prompt and reliable appearance
for meetings and in responding in writing to requirements is
extraordinarily good. -They all havea clear idea of what is
expected of them, confidence that performance will be rewarded

and conversely that non-performance will not be tolerated. Just

prior to his departure, Subject successfully terminated an entire
pf lon nding, a measure which was decided

and from a security standpoint replacement seemed to be in
order. Letting old agents go fs always a delicate and usually a
thankless task. It takes finesse and bargaining skill. Subject

Showed these and more in divesting us of the team without a hitch.

During his last month in despite the fact that he was
burdened with the problems of cTosing out his household and the
normal operational and administrative cleanup prior to PCS depar-
ture, Subject made two very significant contributions to Sta
objectives. First, he coordinated with the

‘operational commitments attests Subject's professional ability and versatility. (This
would be a senior case officer's load by any description and Subject's performance at

Particularly against the difficult MPCHEEK target, this officer has displayed
admirable determination despite thé inherent frustrations and disappointments of work~
ing against this remote and suspicious group. During the period under review, his job
has been the more difficult- since the MPCHEEKS, in all probability
Statior (in which Subject played a major role), have
withdrawn into a defensive shell which makes access operations verge on the impossible.
Nevertheless, he has continued to probe their defenses, and has managed to develop
leads which, with the exercise of patience and application of his proven operational
resources, could eventually to the MPCHEEK Miesion here. This
officer refuses to become discouraged, a quality officers working on hard targets gust

have.

EOMMTRTE OF BEVIERINE OFFICING :
I concur in the ratings and remarks of tho supervisor. During
his first tour abroad, Subject has done very well in his main fields
of activity. His outstanding attribute at the moment is his
persistence not only in going after operational targets but also
in improving himself, ile bas encountered some difficulty in
prosenting his ideas in written form but he has faced up to this
problom and, as the rating officer notes, has mado significant

improvement,

Continuation of Comments by Reviewing Official

Subject has a clear-headed approach to the collection of
intelligence and is realistic in evaluating potential sources.

in the local community and he has developed several potentially
useful sources and identified others.

In considering this officer for promotion, two facts should
be kept in mind:
a. He is probably older and certainly more mature than

the average officer at his grade level, He is anxious to
get ahead and this explains much of his initiative and drive.

b. The rating officer has rated him vory realistically
which, in my view, adds to the importance of the-outstanding
rating given him on Specific Duty No. 2, :

the target is good. The project is, however, in need of good human
reporting assets and it is expected that as Subject overcomes a
weakness mentioned in the next paragraph he will be able to devote
more of his time to this important task.

. The Subject has encountered some difficulty in the preparation
of written material -- dispatches, intelligence reports -- and
finds it necessary to spend an extended portion of his time on its

2 preparation, The rater has discussed this with Subject on several

i occasions, and it is believed that his difficulty is due to a lack
of experience, and that in time ana with a continuing effort on his
part he will develop his writing skills.

The Subject's overall attitude and response towards his pro~
fessional responsibilities during the first tour have been positive.

The period covered by this report encompasses the middle pertion
of the Subject's first tour as a Case Officer, Wis performance
during this period has been balanced in that he has shown the kind

of intelligence and maturity necessary to successfully carry out
clandestine operational activity. He has also shown a weakness which
he will need to overcome in order to achieve his full operating

potential,

The Subject has turned in fine performance in the overall
management of a very important and sensitivelJoperation which
has been under his care since the pre-installation phase. His sure
and careful handling of all succeeding phases of this operation led
to a secure, uncomplicated installation, the recruitment and training
of support agents, and the dissemination of valuable intellizence
information, Subject's natural fluency in the Spanish language has
beon especially useful in this operation, His handling of this

Secially Subject and his wife are proving to_be good mixers and
both are gaining In popularity within the local
comminities., They both have gaincd the respect and appreciation of
the complex not only as compatib. onalities, but In her
willingness to participate actively in jondeavors and
his professional cooperative attitude, Their optimistic and positive
conduct at official and non-orricial functions is a credit to the Base.

proving to be a definite asset in the performance of his assigned
operational tasks and ability to handle agent assets amicably and
productively.

He maintalns accurate accounting records and is demonstrating
respons{ble acute cost consciousness in the use of funds and properties,

This rater's principal criticism!of this employee is his tendency
toward impulsiveness and too-quick Judgement before weighing all the
facts and implications in the pursuit of his operational requirements;
however, this weakness is mere a function of his inexperience in the
field and wlll be resolved as he gains more ficld experience.

Subject, although exhibiting resourcefulness and imagination in
performing his assigned operational tasks also has a tendency to accept
the Judgement of other senior grade officers too readily rather than
expresa his own convictions and trust in his own asses :

if he continues to apply himself tn handling tasks worthy of a

will revert to full-time employment upon finishing his university

~However, he is qualified for this type of duty. His performance in

great use to the Branch in sercening quickly and accurately materials

Mr. Flars agency work background, coupled with his formal
