1. "Do you feel SAl training was helpful to you? (If you choose to do so, please

explain why or how.)

this courco war oxtronely useful to re.

I can think of several instance whore SAI could have helped m

turn several falluros (recrultment pitches) into succeeces.

2.

Oid SAl training provide you with any concepts or tools which can be applied

in a practical way to your work problems? To your personal life? Any

examples you care to mention?

The benefits that thie course will provide for

me in my job as

an Instructor are clear,.

I am abcolutoly cortala that putting

the SAI concept into practice will bilog forth not only self satisfication but

•career benefite as vell.. Thia will aloo be very helpful to re in ry perconal

I can ceo now that sore of the concepts will be put to work irmediately.

What elements, segments, or aspects of the SAl training were of the most interest

or use to you?

The greatest revelation from an operatlot point of then, was the

clarifeation of perhage an erroncous idea we have about obtaining our intelligence

objectives. I always oporared under the bollof tlat the nost important ting in

Please comment, if you have any definite opinion, on the duration and pace of

the training:

too long/short?

too fast/slow?

The pace of the course was

exellent. However, adding one or two more days would certainly help in putting

the SAI concepts into practice by the truinee hirsolf. That 1s, perhaps a live

excercise vith a person who is not sware of the training situation. A traknoe

The special charncter of this national responsibility requires the Agen-

cy to maintain correcpondingly special employment criteria which may be

different from the routine or normal employment standarde of other Gov-

ornment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive

It follows

that ng they ban eat prequest to cher a pentance 1o

a time-consuming proccas which, in addition to loyalty and security

checks, includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness,

and availnbility of a suitable position at such time as employment may

be offered. This 1s called "clearance" of an applicant.

2.

Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance - perhapo something of which the applicant da genuinely un

aware, perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the

Agency make unacceptable.

In any

event, adverse findings by the Agency

are conclusive and final

so far as the Agency 1s concerned, and no state-

ment of specific reasons ia made to the applicant.

3.

Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency la not a right upon

which an applicant can insist.

Offer of employment which 1s subject to

full clearance does not conatitute a commitment on the Agency's part giv

1ng an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim againat, the Agency.

Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearunce 13 at the appli-

cant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage

of applicants are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid

If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considera-

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

Mr. Flores was the only CS-13 officer to hold section chief responsibility, yet his

He was responsible for ensuring the prompt handling of correspondence

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

cont.

I and to devise a secure and timely method of

approach to the individual Cuban.

In comaring Mr. Flores' performance as an operations officer and as a

supervisor,

I belice his perforance is somewhat stronger in the former capacity.

Str. Flores has all the attributes of an excellent case officer: he is aggressive,

thinks operationally, and is fast on his teet in an operational situation. He 1s

further aided by his fluency. in Spanish and has on more than one occasion successfully

] During his TDY travels, he has

repeatedly demonstrated dedication to the job at hand, willingness to work long

hours, and a flexibility to handle all types of situations.

Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic when it comes to the paperwork and bureau-

cratic requirements of his position.

while he is a good writer, he tends to handle

his written tasks in a hurried manner and consequently, his work oftentimes requires

review.

He is also inclined to take the shorter and easier approach when handling

the paper flon requirements.

I mention these points not because they represent

basic shortcomings,

but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performance

in his operations officer capacity.

Mr. Flores is an extreuely experienced, competent and well motivated

His talent as a "street operator" with a keen sense for the

human target has been amply denonstrated.

Ile has now quite successfully been

introduced to his first supervisory position and proven that he is competent for

assiganents of this nature.

I believe Mr. Flores is capable of handling positions

of increasing responsibility and should be given the opportunity to do so.

people a sense of mission and

parricipation which has kept their

morale and motivation, and hence their production, at a high level.

He also Insisted upon

Subject has a clear-headed approach to the collection of

intelligence and

1s realistic in evaluating potential sources.

His fluency in the Spanian language has facilitated his movement

in the local community and he has devoloped several potentially

useful sources and identified others.

In considering this olficer for promotion, two facts should

bo kept in

mind:

Ho is probably older and cortainly more mature than •

the

He is anxious

The Subject has encountered some difficulty in the preparation

of written material • dispatches, intelligence reports - and

The rater has discussed this with Subject on several

The Subject's overall attitude and response towards his pro-

In the CT class beginning Jovember 1967.

The limitations imposed by part-lime employment have prevented

us from assighing li. Flores to jobs within the branch such as the

monitoring of notive fiold cases which require close, dally attention.

Ke accomplishes his tasks

quictly and efficiently with a minimum of guidance from his super-

Eccause he is bi-lingual in Spanish and English he is of

great use to the Branch in screening quickly and accurately mterinls

IT Flars agency work background

coupled with his formal

education about to be completod and his own desiro to make a carcer
