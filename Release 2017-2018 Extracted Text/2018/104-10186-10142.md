The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence - DGI) does not make any regular payments to revo-
lutionary groups but pays them only when they have sutmitted a
plan for revolutionary action (armed struggle) ard have had it
approved in Havana. Tnerefore, there 1s no standard amount paid
to any one group or dishursed in any one country per month or
year, and if no armed struggle is in progress or teirg planned,
no money is given out. Funds expended in Latin America on the
above basis include the following:

Guatemala : During 1963, the DGI paid out about U.S. . :
$250,000, The Yon Sosa group got about :
$200,000 in oneyear for its activities
(included in the $250,000) .

El Salvador : In August-September 1963, when the Salvadoran
revolutionaries were preparing for armed struggle,
‘they received U.S.$50,000. They used the funds
for propaganda, however, and were net given any
mere because they had, in DGI terms, misused
the money.

Nicaragua : During 196% the DGI disbursed some U.S.S15,000.
In addition, the professor, who was one of the
, liaison officers in Mexico, won a suit for some
damage from a company (perhaps Pan American
Airlines) ard was awarded U.S.$30.000, some of
which ke turned over to the guerrillas he /
represented, a

Costa Rica : The DGI gave almost nothing to Costa Rica
* because there-was no revolutionary activity.

Honduras: : The DGI gave Honduran revolutionaries a little
: more taan to the Costa Ricans because after
tne disturbance in late 1963 there was almost
no revolutionary action, most of the
H guerrillas were in exile, and there was &
ia iB considerablé problem caused by the tendency
of guerrilla agents trained tn Cuba to split
off from the Party and make their own Way.

Panama i : Before August 1963, the DGI had given the

Vangardia de Accion Nacional (VAN) some

U.S_$30,000. When the Departamento de

Liberacion Nacional (National Liberation

Department - LN) and the Illegal Department

. of the DG separated ia December 1963
(they had previously been combined in one
MA CIntelligeace) Section), the VAN opera—
tions were transferred exclusively to the
Illegal Department. Somewhat later they
wers returned to the LN Department, What
sums of money were expended during the
period of exclusive Illegal Department
control are not known,

Venezuela : Between 1960 and 1964, the DGI put out more
than U.S.$1,000,000 for revolutionary

activities in Venezuela, in addition to an
unknown amount of arms supplied from Cuba.
Moreover, one of the best Cuban guerrilla
fighters, Major Atelardo COLOME Ibarra,

to Venezuela in 1962 and was still the

tor of operations ia 1964. If COLOME

returned to Cuba after April 1964, when he

was known to be there, he was probably only

back temporarily to collect more money.
