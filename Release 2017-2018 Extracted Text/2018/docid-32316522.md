on this matter. He stated that there is a definite
coolness existing between Hoffa and O'Rourke, O'Brien and
Flynn, but he advised that as he has studied this situation
it becomes apparent that the vice-presidents will not take
any drastic action to cause a split within the Teamsters
ranks. He said that O'Rourke complained to him how, at
