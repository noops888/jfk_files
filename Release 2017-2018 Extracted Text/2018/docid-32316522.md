Re: James Riddle Hoffa

On November 8, 1961, a confidential source

who is employed by the International Brotherhood of

Teamsters (IBT) in the New York area, advised that a

"rift'" has developed between James Hoffa and John

Xo Rourke,

International Vice-President of the Teamsters

extremely

favorable reputation with Harry Van Arsdale, President,

New York State American Federation of Labor-Congress of

Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and will not raid the

AFL-CIO locals in the New York area as requested by Hoffa.

This source stated that if Hoffa insists on

raiding George Meany's locals in New York, O'Rourke will

break with Hoffa and the source anticipates that Joint

Council 16

will be split down the middle on this issue.

on December 18, 1961, thiS source stated he

had been told by O'Rourke that the rift between James

Hoffa and some of the IBT vice-presidents is widening.

INTERNATICNCI

DocId: 32316522 Page 1

Anthony provenzano, Thirteenth Vice-President, has become

Hoffa's right had man.

The source stated at that time that it appeared

the ruling faction of the leamsters was split and would

"choose sides:

.

On January 4, 1962, this source was recontacted

on this matter:

He stated that there is a definite

coolness existing between Hoffa and O'Rourke, O'Brien and

Flynn, but he advised that as he has studied this situation

it becomes apparent that the vice-presidents will not take

any drastic action to cause a split within the Teamsters

ranks.

He said that O'Rourke complained to him how, at

the last executive board meeting, he was seated at the

furthest

end of the taglis doc the entere canes this
