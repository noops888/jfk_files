JUSTIFICATION

014984

This subpoena is required to allow staff access to the

files of informants who perhaps have played pivotal roles in

matters that are in need of resolution by the Committee.

Specifically, the need for access to these files is as follows:

1) Access to the unexcised Invader Informants' files

is needed so that the staff, particularly Bill Webb and Ken

McHargh who are intimately familiar with the King Security file,

can ascertain the role of the Invaders, if any, in the assassina-

tion and, if necessary, interview the informants themselves.

2) Access to the unexcised informant file of the

JER associate who was acting as an FBI informant in 1968 is needed

to ascertain his contact with JER, if any, and to interview him

if necessary•

Informant A (probable associate). This individual

advisea on July 19, 1978, that he did not desire to be inter-

viewed or contacted under any circumstances by anyone from the

HSCA. Since this individual was operated as an informant from

1960 to April, 1966, and there are no documents in his file

subsequent to

April, 1966, this informant file is deemed outside

the period of HSCA interest and is not being made available.

Informant B (probable associate). This individual

was contacted on July 19, 1978,

and stated

he does not want

his confidential relationship with the FBI revealed to the

HSCA.

Since this individual was not opened

as an informant

until August, 1972, and closed in March, 1973, his file is

also believed

to be outside the period of HSCA interest

and is not being made available.

Informant C (probable associate). Efforts by two

field offices of the FBI to locate this former informant have

been negative.

He was last reported to have left the United

States for Europe, exact address unknown.

Since this informant

was operated

brief period in 1968,

and was an inmate of

Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri, his

FBIHQ informant file will be made available

to the HSCA's

Chief Counsel and Director.

All information tending to

identify this informant will be excised in accordance with the

Memorandum of Understanding•

Arrangements for review by

Mr. Blakey should be coordinated with the CIU, Records Manage-

ment Division, FBIHQ.

Informant's field office file at the

Kansas City Field Office was destroyed

during routine file

investigation of the King assassination and results of interview,
