ADMINISTRATIVE CONT'D

Information, set forth below, was obtained by the

Informant, in conversations overheard by the informant!"

PCI HOUSTON advised on 10/7/60,

that MILIER met cAL; F,

SAM at a party she had attended with FRANK SINATRA over a-

year ago.

Since that time she had been his mistress, with

SAM spending over $100,000 on her, with presents of furs,

money, and a Renault car. During

; January, 1959, MILLER and

the subject spent three days at the St. Francis

Hotel, San

Francisco, having the Presidential Suite for the occasion.

During recent months the subject has been seeing MILLER less,

sending her away (from Chicago) whenever he is to see PHYLLIS

AMC GUIRE whom he has been courting.

MILLER has stated that

MC GUIRE

doesn't want to continue the relationship but due

to the subject's interests and connections in the places

where she (MC GUIRE) and her sisters must work, the breakoff

must be a friendly one or she will be out of show business!)

MILLER related that about two years ago, while in

Miamí, Florida,

she was placed in custody as a material witness.

She added she had not furnished any information to the authorities

and was bailed out by WALTER WINCHELL who sent her to Las Vegas

where he had lined up a job for her.

The name of the person

murdered, the place of the murder, and where she worked in Las

Vegas was not mentioned. MILLER related the incident as the

basis of why she is able to acquire information fron and about

the hoodlums she associates with.

MILIER on this occasion,

10/10/60, also related that she knows WALTER WINCHELL through

CHICKIE

JAMES, who formerly owned The Stables, a restaurant

club in NY which, according to former FCI MARSHA RIVERS, was

• actually owned by gamblers JOE CURTIS and JOE RIVERS:4)
