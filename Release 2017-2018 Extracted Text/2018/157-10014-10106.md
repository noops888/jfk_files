MONDAY, JUNE 9, 1975 - SELECT COMMITTEE MEETING AGENDA - AFTERNOON

SUMMARY OF EXPECTED TESTOMONY OF INVENTORI

MAR

51077

JUSTIN O'DONNELL

At 2:00 p.m., before hearing Mr. Bissell, the Committee will hear

briefly the testimony. of Mr. Justin O'Donnell regarding Lumumba.

O'Donnell was in OSS and CIA for almost 30 years and Station Chief

for CIA in l

When he came back

to headquarters

in early 1960 he became Deputy Chief of Staff D of

the Directorate of Plans.

The Chief was William Harvey.

In the Fall of 1960, Patrice Lumumba had been dismissed as Premier

of the newly independent and

troubled Congo.

He was under house deten-

tion, but was being guarded -- and protected -- by U.N. forces, and

thus

was beyond the

immediate reach of President Kasavubu and emerging

strong man Col. Mobutu.

At this time (Fall of 1960) Mr. Bissell was DDP. (As Station Chief

_ in the late 1950's O'Donnell had come

to know Mi. Bissell.)

Bissell called O'Donnell

in and asked him to assassinate Lumumba --

Bissell sent him to a scientist in the Technical Services Division

who, in effect, described various chemical and bilogical

techniques

and

said "pick

your poison."

O'Donnell went back to Bissell and refused to do it because he

was opposed to assassination.

O'Donnell then went immediately next

door to Helms' office (Helms

was then Bissell's deputy) and told him

what had transpired. Helms agreed O'Donnell had been right to refuse.

These

events all occurred on the same evening within an hour.

O'Donnell did agree to go to the Congo to run a political operation

to neutralize Lumumba.

His plan was to entice, or snatch, Lumumba out

of lis protective U.N. detention and turn him over to Mobutu for trial

under Congolese law for crimes he had allegely committed. O'Donnell

was in the Congo for 3 months.

In the Congo, O'Donnell was told by the Station Chief Lawrence

Devlin that there was a virus in the Station Chief's safe. O'Donnell

clearly understood this to mean a lethal one for use against Lumumba.

He heard no more about it.

He does not know if we had

anything to. do

with Lumumba's actual death, but does not think we did.

Subsequently, while in the Congo he spoke about assassination, in

the context of the Congo, with Devlin and with Bronson Tweedy, the

Africa Division Chief.

Does this mean he didn't recall the WH part?
