YURI I. NOSENKO

PK

35 RMB /GCL 2/8

On 1/17/83, source was queried concerning any

knowledge he might have of the NOSENKO matter.

He advised

that "officially" the KGB never discusses defectors and

generally all one would hear would be rumor and gossip.

NOSENKO is considered a "t

as far as source 1s aware.

"yu" in the eyes of the kee

The source assumed that NOSENKO told western

intelligence everything concerning Second Chief Directorate

(SCD) activities in Moscow and further assumes that, as is

custom, a "special Commission" of the SCD was convened

following NOSENKO's defection to do a damage assessment.

As an aside, source noted that his defection would be

'"examined" by members of the K Directorate of the First

chief Directorte and by members of the gth Department of the

S Directorate

Source has no knowledge concerning any connection

between the NOSENKO defection in 1964 and LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S

assassination of President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963.

Asked

to give his opinion on the merits of some speculation that

NOSENKO defected under the direction of the KGB to convince

the Us that the KGB had nothing to do with OSWALD's actions,

source did not believe that to be the case.

In source's

opinion, NOSENKO's defection and all the information he furnished

about the SCD

would have been too great a price to pay

save one man.

source has never heard that the KGB killed or attempted to kill

a defector.

Such actions, if they ever occurred, certainly

ended after OLEG LYALIN's defection in Engländ in 1971(5)

COMMENT:

In 1969, the ATLAST illegal was, in fact, ordered
