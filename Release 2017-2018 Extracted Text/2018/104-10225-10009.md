MEMO FOR THE FILE
Meeting with PACHANKIS 3 March: 1975, 1345-1500, Restaurant at

the Marrior Motel near National Airport

PACHANKIS stated that our old agent Miguel DIAZ Isalgue
waw having trouble yetling his U.S. citizenship approved, DIAZ
had went in all the papers and 1&NS told him the only thing i
left was. the swearing in, So DIAZ waited a year and a half
and IKNS never called him in, He called them tn November 1974
and wan told that there were no problems; that he would bo called.
The DIAZ file whows that IANS requested our traces in
becenber 1974, IP/EIB sent them; there may be something shi”
that is causing @ problem now though that doesn’t explain tho ‘

14 year delay before.
on 6 March, 1 told PACHANKIS to have Diaz call 1&NS ono more

time and if there ig a-real problem, wo'd sec what wo could

do.

_ |, Transmitted herewLth aro the Agent Sorvice Record,
Damaye Report and Form 2457 on AMSTALK-1, who was terminated
29 Fobruary 1968, Subject was terminated for economy reasons,
the Jack of operations] activity and because of the current
JMWAVE reorganization, Tho termination was amicable and with=
out prejudice, Attempts to place Subject with aavther JMWAVE
component or the JMCHALK program were unsuccessful, Ploaso
cancel Subject’s OA and MOC, .

2, JMWAVE believes: it worth noting that Subject has an
excellent operational record and has participated in a numbor
of mpecial operations as a team member, team leader and principal
neont. In addition, he had ahand in tho recruitment of AMTRUNK-

19, and, aw June-1967, mado a NOFIRM-eponsored opera-
tional trip to|

3, Aso ronult of the good will built up with Subject ovor
tho years of WOFIRM service and the excellent rapport maintainod
with him throughout, Subject offered to make himself available on
short notice for any WOFIRM operational assignment. His 201 filo
contains his current location, in the event recontact with him

References: A, IMWAVE 6942, dated 2 May 1967
UMWAVE 6980, datod 4 May 1967

Attached for Headquarters information and evaluation
aro copies of three JMWAVE memoranda, WSO's 3012, 3013,
and 3022, covering tho background and ovonts of tho CUIS
proposal to AMSTALK-1 requesting a mooting to be held in
either Canada or Spain. It should bo noted that some
information reported initially ts corrected {n-tater
memoranda. As presented in referencos and brought
inmoxe dotail in the attached memoranda, the operafipn
by the CUIS seems tobe directed by Manuol/ PINIERO;“tho
professionalTsit shown in the preparation df the mossage
and the subsequent concealment of the mess@ ere
certainly not warranted by the circumstances. Tf the
purpose wore only to get a messago to ANSTALK-1, a
simplo typed letter in a sealed onvolop would have dono
the job. The use of strip film which necessitates

special oquipment for reading, also suggests the possibility

that tho entire operation is designed for the purpose of
opening a channel to WOFACT, PINIERO would probably assume
AMSTALK-1 would report the incident to WOFACT and the
utilization of professional techniques might be a means of

establishing bona fides in order that WOFACT not dismiss the
message as other than genuine, Also attached for Headquarters

are photographs of the crucifix in which the message to
AMSTALK-1 wag concealed,

2. AHSTALK-1 said that his cousin, one Marta ISALQUE

Marta had applied for exit from Cuba some time ago, but it
wasn't until she wrote a letter to Manuel’ PINEINO,}) aka
~Barba Roja, Director of the DG] and close:family friend of
the ISALGUE's prior to the Revolution, that she had any —
-inkIing that her cxit request would be honored. Following
dispatch of the letter, she was telephoned by PINEIRO who
said that he had taken her case under his personal supervision,
and that she would be visited by someone from his office in
the near future, The following day, PINEINO's secretary
called on Marta to discuss the situation, and obtain necessary
additional details. Not hearing anything concrete for about
one month, Marta again wrote to PINEIRO, who again telephoned
her saying that immediate action would be taken, The follow
ing day she was visited by two men who claimed to be from
PINEIRO's office. Ono identified himself as MENENCEZ and said
that he was a former close friend of AMSTALK-1, They gave
Marta a definite date for her departure from Cuba, and
promised to return again to insure that the plans were working
smoothly. Just prior to leaving Cuba, Marta was revisited hy

arta later boarded the Freedom Flight under the Supervision
of HEXENVEZ who permitted bor to bring with her certain of
her personal jowolry which a normal exile is not pernitted.

2. AMSTALK~1 avoided meeting Marta at the airport for
Feasons of socurity, and saw her for the firut timo on the
following night,.12 April, but thero were so many frionds and
family present that thoy bad no chance to talk alone. Marta
did indicate, however, that she wanted to have a loug talk
with AMTALK-1, ‘The following day, Marta left for Wost Palm
Leach vbero sho stayed with rolatives for about one waok, She
returned to Miami and telephoned AMSTALK=1 on 24 April, at
which time 8 mecting was arranged for the sane evoning, It

It apjears to be a positive 35mm film strip of one frame,
According to TSB, it wos a professional concoalzent job. The
nore and address to which AMSTALK-1 may direct his replies
is unxnown to the agent, although all of the facte in the
message indicato that the writer knows AHSTALK-1's position
exactly. Tho agent believes that the reason for the sonding
of the message at. thie time io that he was involved in the
CUBELA/GUIN wrap up and because this is the first time that
@ cloee relative of his has core out. The agent his agreed to
follow whatever instructions we may have for him without
questiog, and reiterated that the Cuban colony here and the
Caatro Governmont know that he cannot be influenced by any
such threats of blackuail against his family, a condition he
has been living with for tho last five years,

Marta and her husband to suggest ways in which "tho uystem”

5. AMSTALK-1 was asi:ed about the possibility of Marta'’s
providing additional information or support, and if sho might
consent to entering into contact with an American, ‘The agent made
it clear that abo wag frightened by what the duplications of the

his family (paragraphs 2 and 3), Ke stated that he did not
recognize the name at the bottom.of the letter (Arturo PITA Rey)
and commented that from talks with his cousin he believed the
real sender of the letter was Manolo PINIFRO\"Barba Roja" (Director
of the. DGI), and that the name and address was probably an
accomodation address used by the-Cuban Intelligence Service.

RETR GORUO “PETERS ;
Action Roquired: For Your Information

1, Operational Activity:

A. During tho period Juno-August 1966, -AMSTALK/1 was
instrumontal in assisting in tho preparation of the ANTRUNK
Operational Team consisting of ANAKA/1, ANTRUNK/24, and ANTRUNK/25
for STEAMER IX and X, a two phaso oporation targottod at southeen
Watanzas and Havana, During tho final planning stages, howover,
it was docided to omit for the present the portion of the operation
directed at Havana, and AMTRUNK/7, a formor ANTRUNK Toam guide on
Operations in the northern Matanzas area, was rehired specifically
acerthe exfiltration phase of the STEAMER IX and X Oporation,
MISTALK/1 was responsible for convincing ANTRUNK/7 to rejoin his
former team, and arranged the necessary cover dotaily which would
oxpiain ANTRUNK/7's absence from the JNWAVE area during the

operation,

B. During July 1966, ANSTALK/1 attended the majority **
of tho three week communications instructors course, but as the
result of the press of business in preparing for the. STEAMER
Operation, was unable to complete the course; it is believed,
howover, that ANSTALK/1 could perform as a qualified instructor :
even though he did not receive his "diploma",

C. A part of AMSTALK/1's contribution to the STEANER
Operation was the extensive and comprehensive debriefing of
refugees to the JMWAVE arca from the operational area, The
information obtained from these reports was of value to the
AMTRUNK Toam in planning for. the STEAMER Operation.
