MEMO FOR THE FILE

Meetluk

with

PACHANKIS & March 1975, 1315-1500, Bestaurant at

the Marror Motel near National Méport

PACHANKIS stated that our old agent Miguel DIA Isalguo

was having trouble butting bis U.S. cittzenship approved.

DIAZ

had

sent in all the

papers

and

I8NS told him the only thing .

left was the swearing in.

so biAz walted a yoar ind a half

and I&NS never called him in. Ho called them in Nuvember 1974

and was told that there were no problems; that he would be called.

The DIN" flle shows that I&NS requosted our traces

1 n

December 1971. IP/EIB sent them; there may bo something tukxe

thom

that is cousing a problem now though that doesn't explain tho

12 year

dolny before.

On 6 March, I told PACHANKIS to have DIAZ call laNs ono moro

timo and if there is a real problem, wo'd see what we could

do .

ANSTALk-I's reaction to the contents of the letter was

mild'and he did not appear too concerned about the threats to

his family (paragraphs 2 and 3): He stated that he did not

recognize the name at the botton.of the letter (Arturo PITA Rey)

and commented

that from talks with his cousin he believed the

rcal sender of the letter was Wanolo PINIFRO| "Barba Roja" (Director

of the. DGI), and that the name and address was probably an

accomodation address used by the Cuban Intelligence Service.

3. AMSTALK-1 Identified the names in Paragraph 2 as follows:
