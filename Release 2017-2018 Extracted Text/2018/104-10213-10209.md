RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL-USE OF CERTAIN
CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS

Reselssion: CSI 50-10, 13 July 1970

L GENERAL

‘ 2. Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of human
‘agents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Dircetorate. In gen-
eral, it is DDO policy to select ageot assets with primary regard to the
agents’ abilities, target access, and security, and with few restrictions as
to their origins, professions or status as members of particular groups. The
basic rule is that any consenting adult may be used by the Operations
Directorate. There are, however, certain sens:tive categories of individuals
‘or groups whose operational use by the Operations Directorate is prohibited
or in some way restricted for reasons pot necessarily related to security
considerations.

b, These prohibitions or restrictions stem from one of the following:

(1) The Agency has been directed by US. Governmental authority to
aestrict or avoid the operational use of a particular category of in-
dividuals.

(2) The Ageacy has entered into a special restrictive agreement with an

Cero + @rganization, government, corporation, or officis! responsible for a

: category of individuals.
(3) The Director or the Deputy Director for Operations has imposed

due to the extreme rigk or sensitivity of such exploitation.

& PURPOSE

‘The purpose of this instruction ts to set forth the prohibitions and policy
restrictions (as distinguished from security restrictions) which currently per-
tain to the operational use of various categories of individuals, together with
the special approval procedures to be followed in certain cases. Where ap-
i propriate, reference has been made to another publication which provides
: more detailed guidance than has been attempted in this instruction. The

special approval procedures set forth in this instruction do not supersede or

alter in any way the requirements for covert approvals contained in DOI
[I> and DOL-F 105.

3. DEFINITI

Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply. :
Special note must be taken of the fact that the key term “operational use”

employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the most succinct - DP
manner consistent with clarity. It has not been feasible, however, to cover in E
4 definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances

which may be encountered in DDO activities, The definition of “operational

use” is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be

employed with responsible operational judgment. Issues involving a deter- D
mination of “operational use” which cannot be resolved with reasonable as-

surance by the responsible operating components will be referred to the

Deputy Director for Operations for decision.

a. Operational Use
Operational use is interpreted to mean the recruitment, utilization, or train-
{ng of any individual or group for DDO purposes on cither a witting or
unwitting basis by or on the behalf of an element of the Operations Direc a
torate, Utilization is made of an individual or §rcup whenever that in- '
dividual or group, responding to the direction or solicitation of a DDO
element, provides information, performs services, provides cover, or supplies
financial, material, or other support necessary for the accomplishment of
DDO operational objectives either directly or indirectly, to or for an ele-
ment of the Operations Directorate.

b. DDO Element
Any person or group who or which is responsible to, owned or controlled >
either directly or indirectly by the Operations Directorate. Included under
this definition are employees or members of Agency proprietary mech-
anisms.

©. Operational Contact

‘Any association having as its purpose the initiation or furtherance of DDO i]
operations.

4 RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE

‘. Restrictions on the operational use of individuals or groups are of four types
and cover twenty five separate categories as outlined below and as described
in greater detail in paragraphs 5 through 8 of this instruction:

(1) Operational Use is Prohibited (see paragraph 5):

ployed or used by the Agency or by organizations under its jurisdiction

the provisions of subparagraph (a) or (b) above must have the
specific prior approval of the Deputy Director for Operations.

(b) If the individual is a former member of ACTION, or a former
trainee whose ACTION service included duty or training over-
seas, five years must have elapsed since his separation from
ACTION.

If contact with a former ACTION member or a former trainee whose

ACTION service included duty or training overseas should be un-

avoidable during the required five year waiting period, the Deputy

Director for Operations may request an exception from the Director

of Central Intelligence. Among the possible reasons, for such unavoid-

able contact would be the designation of a former member or trainee
as the liaison officer to the Domestic Collection Division.
