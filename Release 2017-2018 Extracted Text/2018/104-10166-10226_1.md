Behind

the planning for the UR based on the unification theory was

Rafael

DIAZ Hanscomb (aka: RAFAEL), MRR National Coordinator for

Intelligence.

Though advised by Antonio de VARONA In late 1960

that for political reasons the

"Trente" (FRD) was not in favor of

crentirg a unified resintance organization, the founders of UR

proceoded with its formation, convinced of

eventual recognition.

(5)

ae wan fully intended that 18 much recognition did not

anterialize, the UR would be forced into a ponition an a competitor

of the "Prente" but, an they might logically have solt, with a

chance for predominance owing to UR's broader base among active

Intornal rosistance groups and the program defined in ite highly

acceptable listing of basie principles. (184)

It was emphasized

that the UR was not a political party and that its only 8oal was

to overthrow the Comminiat dictatorship in PBRULEN and establish

• "real democratic regime. " (23)

The UR motto ie "DIOS-PATRIA

LIBERTAD," and It has borrowed the early Christian symbol Ted.

In addition to DIAZ Hanscomb, the following nuclous of

resistance members was responsible for planning the UR concept,

recruiting member groups and drafting its bagde principles:

adherence of large numbers of active resistance members.

was actually represented by a

small dissident faction only, and the genuine 30 November Movement

did not bocons sifiliated with the UR until formation of the "Junta"

Although there is no disunity evident in the UR In PBRUMEN,

the movement in PBPRIME today is experiencing what seemg in

There are two main factions in existence as of January 1963:

1) RODRIGUEZ Espada with GARCIA Oller, who received

documented authority to represent

the PBRUMEN group

in exile; and

•3)

the TORRIENTE group,

He was accused of dealing only with the lL and ignoring

Around the end of October Fernando CAVADA was sent from

KUBARK Headquarters to act as liaison contact between the UR and

KUBARK In the JWAVE area and to undertake other assignments in

connection with unification of exile groups.

Possibly because

discussions had just been held with ZAYAS, and considering his

recently held position as General Coordinator of the UR in PBRUMEN,

no imediate steps were taken at JMWAVE to establish CAVADA as the

Another activity of SANCHEZ and ZAYAS of operational interest

was reported by ANGLAlA in mid-December 1961.

It concerned tbelt

among UR members involved.

Awl reported that Marcos DIAZ Lanz

informed him that KUBARK had granted $150,000 to thig "Phantom Cell"

VIa ROJAS, who used it to finance three overflights during which

pamphlets were dropped which contained instructions in guerrilla

warfare and anti-regiwe propaganda.

ROJAS spent some of the money

in travel to Nicaragua and other countries, and some was said to have

been used

to purchase a small boat for mritime operations. (37;202)

No record of this alleged KUBARK support is avadlablo at JirAVE.

Of the activities

ZAYAS seemed to be engaged in toward the end

of 1961, organization of the UR in exile was not one of his pre

occupations.

Othar UR leaders urged him to establish & more formal

organization, renew contact on a regular basis with the UR in PBRUMEN,

and attempt to gain all possible recognition and support to build an

effective opposition movement.

Some urged him to hold a formel

meeting of the UR merely to gain an opportunity to register protesta

und subatt their resignation.

Among these were Fernando CAVADA,

Wilfredo BRITO, Aurelio FERNANDEZ, and Luis VEGA. (202) By October

1961 other former members of UR and its affiliated organizations:

were also arriving in the JAVE area.

Opposition to ZAYAS grew

and the first formal UR Plenary Session in FBPRINE was held 27

February 1962-

This meeting produced a document called the

"Reaffirmation of Revolutionary Unity." It was also planned at this

meeting to constitute a Junta de Unidad Revolucionaria en el Ex1l1o

The information was compiled in a report written by

RODRIGUEZ Espada, Mario SEIGLIE, Juan HUARTE and Fernando CAVADA•

(197)

The survey indicated that many of the UR member groups in

PBRUMEN were either out of comunication, very sull, or non-existent.

This was especially true of the five which TORRIENTE claimed to

represent, though he was not alone in this respect. (3l)

It was

CAVADA reported in July 1962 that at the time of the survey

The inventory of

maaots claimed by UR as exploitable as a result of this survey are

discussed in Part III of this Attachment.

on its own for support and chose TORRIENTE, President of the Junta

to make the request.

Following these developments,

An announcenent and appeal to exile groups was issued by the new UR

22 March 1962 in Diario las Americas. (14) This put the UR name be

fore the exile public once. more, but the appeal was not successful

from a recruiting standpoint. From time to time the UR position on

current issues was publicized, such as its declaration re ranson of

the Playa Giron prisoners which MEDINA passed to AMBUD] on 14 May

196%: (20)

*Unidad Revolucionaria.., wishes to declare that it does not

agree in any way with the idea and purposes of the relatives

of the prismers of Playa Giron, of exchanging them in a shameful

way by givins 28 or 62 million dollurs to the tyranny which laughs

at; this time ridiculing all PBRUMENs." (Translated extract)

With respect to entry into AMaUD,

& meeting at his home on 17 May

1962 at which the UP was to consider

naming a delegate at the invitation of AMAJD1. This Invitation was

made

during a discussion between TORRIENTE and AMBUD-l following the

expulsion from AMBUD of Oswaldo SOTO as telegate for the UND (aka:

TORRIENTE was invited to replace SOTO because

of his position in UND (its actual leader; SOTO was named by

TORRIENTE as nominal leader).

AMBUD-1 took the opportunity to 1n-

As it turned out, his fearg were unfounded.

The UR In PBRUMEN

received the 28 June letter from LOPEZ and in a document dated 3

July 1962 responded by appointing GARCIA Oller as extraordinary

delegate of UR with orders to reorganize the exile element within

30 days and report the result to PBRUMEN. Only the best, most

On 14 July 1962 the Junta

So further information

ragarding this approach is available.

Another approach to UR was made by UNIR leader Esteban Aquiles

MORRERA.

• In lace June 196%, UR member Ramon ARECHAVALETA CalvO

had brOught HORRERA to meet

CAVADA and RODRIGUEZ Espada to discuss

support for a revolt in PBRUMEN to be attempted without ODYOKE,

KUBARK OF ABUD participation or knowledge.

leading posts in

HORRERA told of travels to New York and

washingtos, interviews with Congressmen (most impressed by Sen.

SMATHERS) ,

PBRUMEN business leaders (mentioned Julio LOBO), and

his success in obtaining & promise from Carlos MARQUEZ Sterling to

Come to the JMIlAVE area to head an anti-AMBUD organization which MORRERA

would attempt to organize.

date, noither of thee proposals has materialized.

Inte 1n Auguet former MRP leader Manolo RAY was discussing

formation of a new, strong, revolutionary "unity" group in Puerto

Rico. . He arrived in the JMIAVE area for meetinga early in September.

mong organizations allegedly to be included were the Un, MRR, MRP,

30 November, MRRC, MAPA and the Huber MATOS group.

RAY was reported

co have "an ally in the White House" who had assured him that 11

" purely revolutionary organization were created "it would be heard

and heeded for major engagements." He was said to have been

advised further that even 11 ODYOKE acted "positively" towards

PBRUMEN, such a new group would have to be taken into consideration

because it would control

"the workers and the mass population." (225)

These efforts

led to the emergence of "JURE" but by no means did it

actually Include UR and the major organizations named. The UR

cannot be considered as sympathetic to RAY, and 1f any part of UR

were associated with "JURE" It would be little more than some minor

caction.

There is no evidence to indicate that RAY has received

support from any UR faction.

Mention of Uit in connection with the new "JURE" can lead to

confusion since this was actually the short title selected at the

UR re organization meting in February 1962 as a designation for the

exile element.

Though recorded in the minutes of that meeting,

title was never used thereafter.

The initials stood for Junta de Unidad

Revolurionaria on el Fx111o). (197)

There 1a ono possible

explanacion for "JURe" hope of gaining UR support.

Among those

This was & clear indication that TORRIENTE planned to continue

granted GARCIA Oller by the National Executive of UR In PBRUMEN.

AMCHEER-1 had reported In August 1962 that TORRIENTE was also active

in the exile community in his capacity as Chairman of the International

Rescue Committee in the Refugee Emergency Center. He was said to be

in contact with U.S. Senators to whom he reported results of

Investigations he is requested to conduct.

sald to be working actively with TORRIENTE on these investigation.

It was further stated that TORRIENTE reported to the President of the

to

"the request made by AMBLDl through DI. Raul MNDEZ Pirez" by

giving a brief history of the l'B, reasons for recently havang ex-

pelled certain sembers, and accusing GARCIA Oller of having

hinself to the making of false documents.

The letter included the

following remarks regarding entry into AMBUD: (196)

This reply to AYBUD-l may have been expedited following publication

in Diario Las Americas on 16 September of an appeal to all exiles

by Jose T. RODRIGUEZ Espada to join UR in the fight for liberation

Of PBRUMEN• He signed as Secretary Ceneral. The appeal included

an announcement of the reorganization of UR in exile based on the

vote of confidence given to Salvador GARCIA Oller by UR in PBRUMEN®

It listed new

officers selected on the basis of stipulations of the

National Executive. In PBRUMEN: that all be former members of the

underground, dedicated and well-qualified. (156)

JWAVE officers had initiated operational contact with RODRIGUEZ

Espada on 17 August 1962 to establish the re-organized UR overt

mechanien as cover for compartmented FI and PM operations. (147)

Discussions had previously been held with CAVADA and GARCIA Oller

concerning selection of an Executive Board.

unanimous choice for the post of Secretary General. (148)

•of U officers suggested by. JMWAVE and the idea of combining certain

posts to produce a small, efficient Executive Board proved to be

cceptable to the new Secretary General at the 17 August meeting.

It was pointed out-to RODRIGUEZ Espada that the UR in exile would

function primarily in the field of political action and propaganda;

clandestine activity in support of UR in PBRUMEN and KUTUBE

operations would be sponsored on a compartmented basis by various

KUBARK elements®

While the Secietary General would be informed of

the broad outline of UR clandestine activities, he would not

necessarily know the details. (147)

Bummary of JHHAVE contact with UR.

At the 17 August meeting it was pointed out to RODRIGUEZ

JWAVE plannod UR entry into AMBUD, with much

publicity, in the hope tiat-such a nove would strengthen ArgiD

and instigate a general unity tendency among exile groups.

this point he indicated that UR would erter AMBUD if necessary,

that this was only because KUBARK wished it.

30 November AMBUD delegate threatened to resign if only one UR

faction were admitted; UR entry is now in abeyance.

Espade submitted a paper on his own concept of how AMBUD might

function more effectively. In essence it stated: (147)

1) ODYOKE would not deal with any PBRUMEN grOup oxcept

2) an appenl for aid by any PBRUMEN group to any. CDYOKE

A fer weeks later the ser UR

offices were opened at 10-12

Sth Street.

The unity appeal sas dated 15 September and

appeared in print the following day.

The first issue of the

official lf. organ, Unidad, was published on 10 jovester 1962.

One resolve of the new UR was to stop the practice of

the names of its affiliated organizations.

As Mario SEIGLIE pointed

out, there seemed to be a competition in the exile community as to

which organization could claim support of the largest number of

exile groups.

The UR wanted no part of this meaningless exercise;

were to work together in the name of UR. (155) The

Executive Board of the re-organized UR in September 1962 was

reported as follows: (194)

In a report to his C/O on 26 July 1962 GARCIA Oller had described

the leading members of UR to be considered for positions on this new

Executive Board.

He also indicated availability to UR for clandestine

operations of three boats owned by Marcos DIAZ Lanz "because of the

friendship existing between us." In the field of propaganda, he said

that Norman DIAZ of "Radio Reloj" 1s a friend of RODRIGUEZ. Espada;

that Miguel RODRIGUEZ Calllet has many contacts in Diario las Americas;

and that Fernando CAVADA receives

"all the support he needg" Iron

the "PBRUMEN Freedom Committee." (47)

other exile organizations subsequently indicated a desire to

join the new UR.

Ricardo ALVAREZ Tunon of

"Rescate Libre" informed

GARCIA Oller in mid-October that he wanted to affiliate with UR and

meke a public announcement of the move. (171)

or the eguivalent in pounds sterling be turned over to a third party

from the Embassy,

and that this sum

"would be guaranteed by either his

wife or KENDALL of Pepsi Cola in New York City."

The letter asked

that the transaction be completed within 24 hours and added that the

be granted asylum by the Embassy. On 2 June another

letter was delivered to the Embassy from GEDDES via Julio VILLANUEVA

(a local attorney for Pepsi Cola) again urging that the money be

turned over as requested.

VILLANUEVA returned to the Embassy on 5

June and said Mrs. GEDDES In PBPRIME had put up the equivalent of

25,000 pesos and that the money would possibly be turned over that

night 'to a "man from GONZALEZ. "

The Embassy again refused to grant

Its original goals were not to

engage in clandestine activity or espionage, but to maintain unity

In resisting Communist indoctrination among

naval officers, with some

vague notion-of possible future mass defection or political action.

The object in joining UR was to obtain a communications channel

An organization chart of the

UR naval resistance group is contained in UFGA 4532 of 25 June 1962

The naval group was to have its own Coordinator on the UR Executive

As an organization, it already had three coordinators: one for

PBRUKEN Navy contacts, one for cerchant marine contacts, and one for

contacts among shore-based personnel of the Navy and merchant marine.

CASTELLVI submitted a partial list of 26 naval and merchant marine

officers who were members of the resistance group.

continually mentioned l'll and other UranIalIonS In the COurse ot

GARCIA Oller reported so April that

UR ons junctioning and had a great deal of potential. THe said he

various types of comunications, and described an unique grenade

triggered bomb shich planned to use

at the proper time against the

Chinese Embassy. (2G)

Santiago CASAMAYOR Alonso stated in March 1962

that prior to lls departure from PBRUNEX be had learned from pedro 0b

LOPEZ Penaranda that UR vas collecting data for diagruma of the shell

and Standard Ot1 refinertes in Habana, lists Of DSE and Communist

Party members,

shipping dats on all ports (arrivals, departure, cargo)

etc. (68)

Another source reported the following' as UR sabotage

The UR

was reported to possess a low powered volce tranamitter in Habana

which allogedly began broadcasting on 18 April 1962 on the 40

meter band (7aca) at 1330 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

The station

was said to have been built by a. "German engineer" who

was alno working on a portable transnitter to fit in the trunk of

• car which would be used to broadcast from various garages.

Information was supplied by VIERA and FUENTEFRIA. (15)

A subsequent ..

report claimed UR had a trananitter in May 1962 which was bullt

into the trunk of a car,

operated on 1200 kcs, came on the afr on

Monday, Wednosday and Friday from 1400-1430,

schedule wam monitored at YOACRE but no transmissions were heard. 17)

Ut was also engaged in propaganda activity, according to

examples passed to JWAVE In June 1962, although such programs were

probably not extensive since they achiured little notoriety:

The vari

ous ideas noted included counter propaganda which quoted from

goverpment publications and Journals,

then followed with the "truth"

of the situation®

One of these was signed by a PBRUMEN dentists'

association in UR.

Another program was an appeal to nations having

trade Agreements with PBRUMEN to cease shipping goods to Communist

dominated nations, reminding exporters what Communism has brought to

the people of PBRUMEN.

A mimeographed appeal was circulated among

mombers of the armed forces which asked that they carry on their

dutles, but ald the resistance by cooperating with the

"Infiltration

forces which exist in all branches of the armed forces."

The mulitary

were adrised to: discuss their resistance contacts with

no ene, to air:

normally as an average servicemen since it is realized they must

maintain an income to provide for their fanilles, but to ignore the

"call of the red beast" on D Day and to "get lost." (95) Another

example of UR propaganda was the publication of Cuba Clandestina

(October 1962 issue claimed distribution of 25,000) by the.

resistance organization of that name and Rescate Libre, Identified

as UR member organizations. (192)

Balvador GARCIA Oller in May 1962 submitted a plan for organizing

an intelligence collection net utilizing UR sources and contacts in

ecme of wnom woro already included in a partially organized

not. (17i)

development was primarily due to UR connection with the "August

uprising."

During the first week of August 1962 at a meeting of JNR, the

Coordinator of the 30 November Movement proposed that JR take part

In a general uprising being planned by the FAL to occur between 8

and 30 August. (169)

The FAl, It was said, would proceed with

The FAL had said the uprising would be on a national scale, that its

organization was strong in Oriente and Habana Provinces, but that

It had asked for help from the Segundo Frente Nacional del Escambray

(SNE) because FAL was weak in Las Villas Province.

Manuel VIERA

Inter said the DRE and MRP were also involver. (63)

There were two

initial reactions to this proposal in the JNR:

that it was another

crackpot scheme, or that it was a G-2 provocation.

There is no

record of the position taken by JNR. as a whole, but the 30 November

group was apparently in favor of participation, and UR was concerned

to the extent that it arranged iur oxfiitration of lunuel vianA

CURREST OPERATIOSAL SLIDLAKY

LNIDAD REVOLLCIOLBIA (UR)

Part

Organization of Overt Mechanisa

Objectives of JAVE in establishing and maintaining contact

with the Executive Connittee of UR in exile were primarily to

provide a viable cover mechanise in the fora of an exile resistance

group for the several unilnteral operations in being or projected

which involve MUBARK assets within UR.

A secondary objective was

to create similtaneously & KUCAGE vehicle responsive to JMAVE

direction which would serve ODYOKE policy needs for the present,

and develop into a political entity of stature in PBRUMEN after

the overthrow of ANTHUG to assure the presence of a soderate element

In the, anticipated struggle between extremists of the right and left.

More specifically, the UR "umbrella" mechanism will cover

netivitles of various JIWAVE assets with minimun possible danger

that operations becone common knowledge, or are exploited for

personal political or material gain, or are otherwise interfered

with by other than direct participants. JWAVE intends also to

guide ul entry Into AMBUD and encourage other exile groups to

follow.

UR successes of any type would thus be shared by AMBUD,

provided conditions are such that they may be publicized.

JIVAVE, by supporting UR exploitation of public media, would

be able to disseminate propaganda themes to PBRUMEN exiles

In PEPRIMS,

to atin America,

and occasionally to other areas of the free world.

Buch KICAGE activity would be supplemented as conditions permit by

covert KUCAGE programs in PBRUMEN. In the political field, it is

planned to prepare members of UR in exile and in the resistance to

assume responsible roles through democratic processes after llbera

tion of PBRUMEN.

The UR principles are based on the Constitution of

1940.

Its objectives are stated in Attachment A, as interpreted

by Uh.

JIVAVE direction of UR exile activity was effected through a

KUBARK developmental asset,

Salvador GARCIA Oller, who received

credentials dated 3 July 1962 from UR in PBRUMEN,

with orders to re

organize its extie alement. JWAVE, through frequent contact with

GARCIA Oller, Influenced the seloction of qualified personnel in UR

for the new Precutive Board, at the same time eliminating a number

of positione in ar attempt to croate a furctional.gro..p.0f respossible

officers considered politically reliable.

The restructured UR exec

utave is headed by Jose I. RODRIGUEZ Espad, who had worked with the

Sounder RaraeL DIne Hanacomb, in establishing UR in PBRUMEN.

Contact

mas made with RODRIGUEZ Espada In August I962 via AUBLEAK-1,

and the

former has been most cooperative, Accepting KUBARK direction and

adhering to the principle of compartmentation.

UR applied for adminsion to AMBUD on 17 Septembor 1962, but

noceptance was delayed by a protoat ropiatorod by Jose E. de la

TORRIENTE y Ajuria, hoad of the dianident un faction which did not

recognizo the orodontiala received by GARCIA Ollor, nor the re

organizod UR executive.

TORRIENCE Instatod that UR unity could be

nohloved only L1 RODRIGUEZ Espada'n froup were to rojoin his ow,

which he olaimed to be the true UR.

AMBUD eventually became

persuaded to conalder a vote on the UR application; partly on the

bania of proof of authenticity reeived

from a dopoaltion proparod

by AkHINT-83, who had boon in PBRUhaN and in toucl with UR loader.

Ihis 11a1s00,

as well as contacts with AMBUD members of cther exile groups, has gone

far toward settling

the problems of UR factionaliss and entry into

ABUD, which will probably be effected in the dear future.

Beginning with the administrative and housckeeping chores of

netting up new offices, the UR propaganda effort has received an

average of $4500 per month, of which $2330 pays salaries, approx-

Imately $650 1s spent on rent, utilities and telephone, and the

remaining $1500 on supplies and equipment directly relatod to

autput of propaganda.

been achieved with presa and radio personnel, and from time to

tIme UR releases are Innerted gratie in news

and commentary.

One early propaganda succese was publication of two lentlets

based on food research and dramatic presentation.

completion of his KUBARK training, subject observed the shortcomings

of UR and other underground organizations with which he worked in

PERUMEN®

For reasons of operational security he has been safe

housed to avoid contact with UR in exile, and considers himself &

unilateral KUBARK agent.

AMSTASH-I does

not plan to renew UR

contacts after Infiltration into PBRULEN, as he feels his former

contacts may be contaminated, or too much risk would be involved in

attempting to utilize them.

JIWAVE plans re-infiltration of

AMSTASE-1 as the leader of a two man team with the following

The Loc claims assets in PBRUMEN, and JIAVE has attempted

Owing to poor comunication

and the security consciousness of internal assets this has proven

Bonewhat frustrating.

It is possible that internal assets of LDC
