MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Orlando Avila y Bosch

1. MI.

of the WH Haiti Desk called on

25 May 1967 and stated that they had been advised by an asset

in New York that Rene Juares Leon had been arrested by the

FBI in New York City on that date. A bench warrant for the

arrest of Leon had been issued by the District Court for the

Southern District of Florida since he failed to appear for his

arraignment in March 1967. He was indicted along with

Rolando Masferrer for plotting an invasion of Haiti. Mr. Gremillion)

said that they had no operational interest in Leon, but their sources

had indicated Leon might be considered a political

asset in the post

Duvallier era in Haiti. Mr.

asked my opinion as to

whether or not this possible future use of Leon might have an

effect on the charges being dropped against him. I told

Mr.

that it seemed highly unlikely that the Judge or

the United States Attorney would consider dropping the charges

since Leon had failed to appear before the court when so ordered.

2. I called Mr. Morris, Internal Security Division,

Department of Justice, the attorney handling both the Masferrer

and Bosch prosecutions, and told him that Leon had been arrested.

It was in a previous conversation with Mr. Morris that he told

United States Attorney and the Department of Justice were

considering postponing the date of bringing the indictment against

Bosch because of the problems which had developed in Miami after

a Cuban refugee named Rivero had been arrested. The information

available indicates that Orlando Bosch has been the leader of the

protest demonstrations against Rivero's arrest. It would therefore

seem prudent to delay the indictment rather than precipitate

greater demonstrations in the Cuban community of Miami.

3. It should also be remembered that Orlando Bosch

was acquitted of extortion charges in December 1966 in the Miami

District Court, and it is therefore considered unlikely that any

jury will convict Bosch of the current Arms Control violation

charges.

A separate problem which may influence postponement

of the indictment is the continuing publicity generated by the New

Orleans District Attorney with his investigation of the assassination

of President Kennedy and his continuing references to the involvement

of Cubans both in 'New Orleans and Miami in the conspiracy.
