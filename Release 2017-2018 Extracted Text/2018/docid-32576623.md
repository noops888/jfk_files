fight occuring in the HAROLD SMITH family of the Harold's

Club, Reno, Nevada. Information developed since that time

indicates HAROLD SMITSR., wanted his stepmother killed tigA

and allegedly arranged with a member of the San Jose family

Of LA COSA NOSTRA to have this done.

Subsequently, the SMITH

family trouble was settled and the contract was cancelled.

However, LA COSA NOSTRA feels that since the contract was agreed

upon, SMITH still owed the money

as $100,000.

have been made to collect this amount from HAROLD SMITH, SR.,

and the situation has been the subject of discussion by

San Jose group on a number of occasions but to date, no definite

plan of action has been selected by LA COSA NOSTRA.

was in contact with JOHN MISURACA (who called long distance

from New Jersey). MISURACA told ALEX that he interded to

telephone number of JosePheers.

„According to ALEX, U.S,A-

MISURACA attempted to contact CERRITO at his automobile agenés

after the regular working hours, but was advised that CERRITO

was gone for the day.

The person MISURACA talked with de-

clined to furnish CERRITO's home phone number.

Informant furnished ALEX with CERRITO's home phone

number and ALEX indicated he would relay this information to

MISURACA immediately.

ALEX then remarked in Sicilian that

"the shepherd went to the mountains against JOHN's orders"

which was interpreted by informant to mean that CERRITO had

gone to Reno, Nevada in connection with the HAROLD SMITH caper

against JOHN MISURACA's wishes. ALEX then instructed informant

that he was to contact CERRITO

at his home within the week,

adding

that informant should not be surprised if he were to

have a "visitor"

at his home at any moment.

ALEX would not

give informant any further details or clarify his statement

on the telephone. Informant, as of this date, has not re

ceived any guests or visitors at his home.

SF 2550-C-TE said he dropped in at the CERRITO home

on Sunday, 3/14/65, but was advised by CERRITO's married

daughter that CERRITO was called away on business.

She sug-

gested that informant confirm any future meeting with her

father by telephone.

Informant telephonically contacted

CERRITO on the night of 3/16/65, who instructed him to meet

him at the Los Gatos Lodge within one half hour.

At the

appointed time, informant met CERRITO at the lodge and

CERRITO apologized for not meeting at his home, his excuse

being that earlier in the day he had made arrangements to

receive a long distance call at the Los Gatos Lodge (which

Le apparently had landled prior to Informant's arrival at the

Informant then opened conversation advising CERRITO

that he had been instructed by cAMARATA to contact ceRRilo,

but informant made no mention of the fact that he was aware

Of CERRITO's travel to reno; nowever,

he did mention that he

furnished CERRITO's phone number to JOHN MISURACA. CERRITO

brushed off any further comment in connection with any contact

he had or may have had with MISURACA saying, "It was all right -

it was nothing of any importance." CERRITO then inquired as

to informant's employment.

Informant indicated to CERRITO

that he was doing very well with his

job and that financially

was better off than he has been in a longtime, CERRITO

praised informant's attitude and asked if informant had given

any thought to

"bettering himself"

were offered a Cadillac franchise, he would without hesitation

drop his Lincoln-Mercury dealership since it would be an oppor-

tunity to make more money.

He then indicated to informant that

he wanted informant "to make one more try up in Reno"; that he

ranted informant to obtain a job in that city. Inormant ad

rised CERRITO that it would be most difficult to give up his

present dob and further, he knewn one in Reno except Gull

CERRITO said that he would not have to be concerned with TENT

anymore because

"he's dead anyway.

CERRITO told Informant

NEVALA

he had a contact in Reno who could help informant locate the

right job, although the identity ofthis person was not dis-

closed by CERRITo.

CERRITO

then asked,

"What do you think of

taking the boys for a side?" (meaning,

taking ALEX CAMARATA

and PETE MISURACA to Reno with him.

Informant told CERRITO

that if he had any choice in the matter and if it was only to

travel on a routine trip, hewould rather not take PETE along

but "if it's business concerning Our Thing, I'll take him

along.

On 3/21/65, informant was advised by JOE CERRITO

that he was postponing the meeting planned for this night to

3/23/65. He instructed informant to be at the Los Gatos

Lodge, San Jose, California, at 8:30 p.m. and that he was

to bring ALEX with him.

Informant immediately contacted ALEX advising him

of the change in plans and ALEX indicated that he would be

present.

During the afternoon of 3/23/65, Mrs. ALEX CAMARATA

telephonically informed informant's wife that her husband would

be unable to attend the meeting at Los Gatos Lodge as they were

expecting a relative from Detroit.

Upon receipt of the above message, informant contacted

ALEX at kis home who stated he

"wanted no part of it"

and flatly

refused to attend the meeting.

Informant did not press ALEX for his reasons as

ALEX will not engage in discussions over the phone which concerns

organization business.

Informant was of the opinion that

ALEX waS

aware of what was to be discussed at the meeting although

informant, himself, had no inkling of what was to transpire.

informant met CERRITO

• at the Los Gatos Lodge on the night of CERRITO CERRITO was

accompanied by DOMINICKLANZALONE. Informant made an excuse for

ALEX's absence, explaining that an unexpected guest had arrived

at his home and also, that ALEX indicated he was not interested

in whatever it was that was to be discussed.

According to informant, DOMINICK dominated the

entire meeting in that he did most of the talking.

He inquired

as to whether or not informant was satisfied with his job and

the salary he was receiving.

He talked as though he was leading

up to a job offer. His conversation, according to informant

was such

I that it was either "double talk" or that DOMINICK

believed that informant had complete knowledge concerning the

matter under discussion.

In apparent reference to the HAROLD

SMITH matter at Reno, Nevada, and informant's 3/16/65 discussion

with CERRITO (above)

ANZALONE told informant that it was

up to him (informant) and him alone to make a decision; that

"up there (Reno) you don't know who you're dealing with and you

have to be careful."

Informant told ANZALONE that he didn't know

supposed to contact in Reno, to which CERRITO replied,:

"DAVIS" - "you know, it's just & name

like (HAROLD) SMITH or

anybody else.

ANZALONE then added,

"something had to be done

(in Reno) and you (Informant) will have to decide if you're the

man to handle the assignment"

• CERRITO inserted,

not a gambler. You've already told SMITH who you are.

"They, know you're

With reference to CERRITO's last statement, Informant

believes

CERRITO was indicating that informant's

mere presence in

sight of HAROLD SMITH would serve as pressure and a reminder

that the organization was serious in getting monies owed by

SMITH.

On 3/29/65, informant advised that on

3/28/65,

ALEX CAMARATA informed SF 2550-C-TE that his visitor

of 3/23/65 was widow of SAM MISURACA.

SAM, deceased brother of

JOHN MISURACA, was killed in gangland fashion In the Detroit

area in 1919.

ALEX did not volunteer SAM's widow's name although

he did mention that a few years following SAM's death, she

married a close friend of SAM's

at the time of his murder.

The main purpose of her visit was to deliver a

message from ALEX's father-in-law, JOHN MISURACA. She advised

ALEX that her son (or possibly grandson) is to be ordained

to the Priesthood next May in Detroit,

Michigan, and that this

ccasion would afford an excellent time for meeting of certain

organization members in that it would attract little or no

attention of the authorities.

ALEX indicated that JoE CERRiTo,

Don of

the San Jose, California Family of LA COSA NOSIRA, would

be invited In addition to many other 'friends" including members.

of high statue within the organization.

SF 2550-C-TE then informed ALEX as to his meeting

with JOE CERRITO and DOMINICK ANZALONE on 3/23 last, and that

he wasn't at all certain as to exactly what CERRITO and ANZALONE

had in mind with regard to the Reno situation.

ALEX then explained that CERRITO was recently in

contact with JOHN MISURACA at which time the HAROLD SMITH

matter was discussed. Upon termination of their discussion

it was agreed between the two men that should further discussion

be necessary it could be handled by long distance phone calls

to pre-arranged locations.

With regard to CERRITO's and ANZALONE's proposal that

informant might take it upon himself to go to Reno, ALEX suggested

that Informant "tell CERRITO and ANZALONE to shove

it", adding

that informant shouldarait the outcome of the Detroit meeting

planned for next May at which time a definite course of action

would be recommended.

ALEX was of the opinion that since CERRITOhas lost

of discussion at the Detroit meeting.

CERRITO and ANZALONE would not order informant to resolve the

Reno issue but were attempting to get him to volunteer for this

mission; their reason being that if informant failed they

would not lose face and therefore be further embarrassed, but

11 ne were to be successiu, they could claim all creait

nd regain their lost prestige.

ALEX added that JOHN MISURACA is attempting "to

get something going out here (California)" in addition to

resolving the HAROLD SMITH matter but that JOE CERRITO wants

no part of it.

ALEX said,

"JOE has the car business (Lincoln-

Mercury

dealership) and doesn't want to do anything against

the law"

"How would he feel if he didn't have any cars---

if they took it away?" "What they give they can take back.

JOE's satisfied but people in the East aren't. Like JOHN said

at Roswell, (New Mexico) they don't know what they're doing

out here.

ALEX hinted that both he and the informant may

be invited to the Detroit meeting.
