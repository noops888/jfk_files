2. COLONEL THAO SAID THAT THE COUP D'ETAI GROUP TO WHICH HE BELONGS IS

PLANNING CAREFULLY AND MOVING CAUTIOUSLY TOWARD A COUP SINCE THEY WISH TO BE

REASONABLY CERTAIN OF SUCCESS. HE STATED THAT THE GROUP WILL TAKE ACTION WHEN

THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF UNITS IS ACHIEVED.

HE CLAIMED THAT THE MOVEMENT OF

MILITARY UNIIS TO SUPPORT AN ATTEMPTED COUP WAS GOING FAIRLY WELL AND THAT THE

GROUP WAS NOW TRYING TO OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMORED UNITS. IN SAIGON, WHICH

WOULD MAKE A SUCCESSFUL: COUP MUCH EASIER TO ATTAIN AND WOULD CAUSE LESS BLOODSHED.

3. THAO REMARKED THAT THE DEPARTURE OF IRAN KIM TUYEN, FORMER DIRECTOR OF

THE PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY SERVICE, FROM SOUTH VIETNAM WILL PROBABLY HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE TUYEN GROUP COUP D'ETAT PLANNING, BUT MIGHT PROVE HENEFICIAI

TO THAO'S GROUP AS NGO DINE NHU MICHT RELAX IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ONE OF THE

GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM'S MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES IS OUT OF THE WAY.

4. THAO MAINTAINED THAT THE GENHRALS OF THE ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM

ARE UNDEPENDABLE; THEY CLAIM THAI THEY ARE AWAITING A POSITIVE INDICATION THAT THE

NGO FAMILY IS PLACING PRESERVATION OF THEIR OWN PERSONAL POWER ABOVE THAT OF THE

COUNTRY, AND/OR POSITIVE PROOF THAT NHU IS DEALING WITE THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF

VIETNAM. THAO REMARKED THAI THESE ARE MERELY EXCUSES AND THAT THE GENERALS ARE

AFRAID OF LOSING PRIVILEGED POSITIONS.

5. THAO REMARKED THAT, IN HIS OPINION, NHU MIGHT THINK THAT HE CAN MAKE A

DEAL WITH THE COMMUNISTS AND END UP BY TRICKING THEM. THAO CLAIMED, HOWEVER, THAI

IF NHU ACTUAIIY BELIEVES SUCH A THING, HE IS VERY MUCE MISTAKEN. THAO STATED THAI

NHU COMPARED WELL WITH HIGH-RANKING COMMUNISTS, BUT THAI HE MAKES UNILATERAL

DECISIONS WHILE THE COMMUNISTS MAKE DECISIONS ONLY AFTER DISCUSSIONS, THUS

PRECLUDING SERIOUS ERRORS. THAO SAID THAT, WHEN SPEAKING WITH NHU, HE HAS OFTEN

FELT THAT HE WAS SPEAKING WITH A COMMUNIST SINCE NEU IS ALSO DEVIOUS, DISRESPECT-

FUL, OF. LEGALITY; AND WILL DO ANYTHING TO FURTHER HIS OWN GOATS.

6.

THAO COMMENIED THAT. NHU RECENILY TOLD THAI LANG. NGHLEM, A CLOSE FRIEND

OF NHU, THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO SOMETHING SOON THAT WOULD BE VERY SURPRISING,

BUT THAT IT WAS TOO EARLY TO DIVULGE WHAT HE HAS IN MIND. THAO HAD NO IDEA WHAT

NHU HAD IN MIND, BUT SPECULATED THAT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH NORTH

VIETNAM.
