committee .on.Cuban Subversion, The Services and ASD/ISA have
concurred in this report with a few minor nonsubstantive sugges-
tions (these are noted in ink).

on the grounds that certain actions have been. taken with respect to
the Alerting System without sufficient authority.

Another meeting of the Subcommittee has been scheduled for
Friday afternoon in order to resolve this difference. I plan to attend
and ‘will report ‘any substantive actions. :

PROGRESS. ACHIEVED. DURING APRIL. IN IMPEDING. TRAVEL. TO. .CUBA

1.. The Department..of State has:
a. Participated in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the. 3-4 April. Managua Meeting respecting discouragement of
travel’ ofLatin Americans ‘to! cuba for training 1n,bubversion.
The text of the resolution is appended. hereto,

b, Headed an interdepartmental team currently: visiting the
Isthmian capitals whith the objective of securing the fullest
and quickest implementation of all. the recommendations. agreed
on at Managua. Prior to the departure of the team, Department
of State posts were instructed to inform the host governments
of the-trip and to encourage them to identify the kinds and
extent of technical assistance. it. would be most useful: for ithe
United States to-furnish.

¢. Caused.to be noted in U.S, passports since 1 April
that they are not. valid for travel to. Cuba,

d. Following an indication that the Bolivian Government
might be willing, to increase efforts to impede travel of its
nationals, to Cuba, instructed the U.S. Embassy to recommend
that the GOB:

1) Ban trayel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except

for official or special purposes approyed by the GOB,

and establish legal penalties. for violations;

2) Require Bolivian citizens to haye a’ passport or
other GOB docuitent to travel abroad;

3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba. unless
specially endorsed; :

4) Seek arrangements with third.countries which are
important transit points under which third countries will,

assist. the. GOB in preventing.tinauthorized travel by Bolivians

and will help identify violators.
e@ Drawing on the recommendation in the paper: on. "The
Moverient. of Subyersives and Subversive Trainees" and. other
sources, instructed the. non=isthmian posts. to encourage host
governments to take additional counter-subversion steps.
Each instruction was tailored to the local situation in
the recipient country and included appropriate suggestions
as to strategy which might be used in securing implementation
of the. desired actions,
(Jaa Requested. posts in Latin America to encourage host
governments: to take appropriate, measures to discourage
participation. of their nationals in Cuba's May Day cele
bration, and to prevent’ charter flights from their. country
to Cuba for the celebration. :
ae Through. efforts with various Latin American and.other
governments; discouraged participation in. the Cuban solid-
arity Congress. U.S. efforts contribubed to limiting. the
success of the Congress from the. Castro+Communist point. of.
view.

2. The Department_of Defense has
a. Continued the US sea and air surveillance of the

area surrounding Cuba until 25 April.1963, at the same

rate and with the same emphasis as existed prior. to that

date. Since 25 April 1963 additional sea surveillance

has been realized between Cuba and Haiti, due to the

stationing of the Caribbean Ready Amphibious. Squadron at

the entrance of the Gulf-of Gonaives occasioned by the

deterioration of internal conditions within Haiti.

Reports of subversive movement, or suspected subversive

movement, obtained by. US suryelllance are available for

immediate transmittal through the US military alerting

system,

b. Continued action, at high priority,.on the instali-
ation of military communications facilities in Latin. America.
AS of 1 April, a commercial submarine cable from Florida
to Panama became operational. This. cable gives reliable
voice and teletype communications to CINCARIB including
both classified teletype and voice. Negotiations are
continuing in Honduras, Colombia and@ Ecuador for the
installation of military radio faéilities. Installation
of a multi-channel radio. station has been completed in
Costa Rica. A similar facility in Nicaragua is scheduled
for completion:by. 1 July 1963.

c, Established an Intelligence Center.at CARIBCOM' Head-
quarters, in-connection with the. program. of surface
surveillancé of the Caribbean, for rapid processing ‘and
dissemination to countries concerned, via the American
Ambassadors, of intelligence on the movement of subversives,

Caribbean revealed that the Intelligence Center should be
established at Caribbean Command Headquarters and that a
center. need not be established at. Headquarters, Caribbean
Sea Frontier.

a, Established on 11 April a U.S, military alerting
system operated: by CINCARIB and CINCLANT. Pursuant to the

Washington has increased from 3,000,000 groups handled
in October 1962 to.15,000,000 groups handled in March
1963.

b. Increased its efforts designed to control the move-
ment of persons, arms and propaganda materials to and |
from Cuba. A summary of actions by country is provided
below:

1) Argentina - Station, in conjunction with thé
Embassy, has continued.to press the Argentine govern-
ment to enact effective travel control legislation
and to adopt measures recommended by the Special Con SULTATWE CoMMiITTE¢

ON -Security [Samrresse] of the OAS. Information on

Argentines travelling to Cuba is being furnished to

the Argentine government by the station, Several

potential. travellers to Cuba have been spotted and

are being assessed by the. station: Information from

three recent returnees from Cuba is being obtained

through debriefings, Station. reports that. because of
increased Mexican controls, all truly clandestine

travel to Cuba from Argentina is now.via Prague. Che

Guevara's mother was arrested on 23 April upon her

return to Argentina for importing Castro propaganda.

2) Bolivia ~ Station and Embassy have been urging
Bolivian government to adopt stricter travel .controls,
without’ apparent results so far. Names of travellers
known to-have returned from Cuba are being furnidhed
to the Bolivian government. Thus far, no action is
known ‘to have been taken by the Bolivian government on
the strength of such information, Station comments that
problem with Bolivia is not in laek of information
available to government on Cuban subversion, but in

getting Bolivia to do something about it.

3) Brazil - Information on Brazilians who have
received subversive training in Cuba has been made
available to the Brazilian Foreign.0ffice, through the
American Ambassador, and to.the National Security
Council through CIA liaison with the NSC's Security
Service.

An asset of the CIA station in Rio is in.a position
to harass and delay Cuba-bound travellers in those
instances. where the Station is able to.tip him off
regarding their destination, He can also harass
returnees when informed in advance, The Station is
taking steps to get appropriate. information to him
promptly.

4) Chile - Chilean internal security. authorities,

at urging of station, are trying to impede dnd harass

travellers to and from Cuba. Government is now requiring
passport applicants to state destination, and. passports
must be turned in.after travel. The Foreign Minister

has stated much progress is. being made, with cooperation
of the Mexican government, and that travel of Chileans to
Guba has. been dramatically, reduced in recent. weeks.
Station and. Embassy are continuing pressure.on Cuban
government in this regard. Names of travellers to Cuba
are being passed to the Ambassador, who furnishes them

te President Alessandri (who has asked that this collab-
eration be kept secret), Information from CIA unilateral
operations against Cuban Embassy is. being used by a newly
created Chilean surveillance team.in checking out purpose
of travel projected and in following up on returnees from
Cuba. The station has an agent in ‘daily contact’ with

leaders of the extreme militant left and 1s exploring

the possibilities of sending three station assets to
Cuba for training and intelligence missions. A Cuban
First. Secretary was declared personal non grata during
April for using false identity documents, and the Cuban
charge d'affaires was subsequently recalled by his own
government .

5) Colombia - Chief of Customs has indicated to. station
his willingness to institute an improved travel. control
system. One station asset expects to travel to Cuba
in the near future, Statdon believes it has identified
a-courier operating between Colombia and Cuba and has
mounted an operation to uncover. his Colombian contacts.

6) Costa Rica - Station reports’ little pro-Castro
activity during April. No recorded travel to or from
Cuba has taken place. .Local authorities appear inclined
to cooperate in control program.

7) Dominican Republic - Efforts to get Juan Bosch to
take active steps against Communists and travellers to

and from Cuba have been fruitless to date, as have been

efforts to. establish a new and effective internal security
organization in the Dominican Republic. Bosch appears
to have lost his previously stated enthusiasm for such
a service, but efforts to persuade him to approve a
proposed budget for the service are continuing.

8) Ecuador = Station reports that, largely as a result
of both overt and covert propaganda activities of U.S.

agencies in Ecuador, the public awareness.of Cuban sub-

version has’ changed from apathy to genuine concern, The

government, however, is no more inclined to tkke action
than before. The National Director of Immigration has

stated that he personally would like to do whatevey he

the station, lost his hand in testing a homemade bomb

The station chief has accompanied the American

Ambassador on visits to the Eeuadoran Ministers of
and Government to stress the threat.of Cuban backed
subversion.

Approximately 7,000 pounds of Commmist propaganda
are being destroyed monthly ss a result of a unilateral

operation of the CIA Base in Guayaquil.

9) Haiti - Station reports that several assets have

travelled to points outside Port-au-Prince in an effort

to learn of possible travel to and from Cuba. . Reports

from areas of Capt Ha ,- Port de Paix, and

and la Tortue Islands, were negative.

known Honduran Communists have recently travelled to
Cuba. Information as to their identities is. being fur-
nished to President ‘Villeda through the U.S. Ambassador’.
11). Mexico - A CIA source states the Cuban Embassy, has

issued 10-15. visas during April on pieces of paper

separate from the passport, but the government's practice
of stamping all. passports to show tragel to.or from Guba
has largely nullified this effert by travellers to avoid
the stigma of travel te Cuba, All Cubans arriving in
Mexico, whether in transit or otherwise must have Mexican —
visas. This is not true of other nationalities, who need
no visa if in transit. The government continues te
confiscate propaganda material from Cuba sporadically at
the airport. .The government recently refused visas to
five Cuban doctors who wished to attend.a Urology Congress
ad

in Mexico, .Several station assets have recently trave:
to Cuba for intelligence purposes.

from Cuba are being. debriefed regarding their training and
contacts, and several CIA assets are expecting to leaye

for Cuba in the near future for treining. CIA has

increased its persennel assigned te travel control functions

ports, and must.be renewed every $1x months - in cases
where information from the CIA station or. from the
Uruguayans' own sources indicated intention of

unilateral operations is being passed regularly. to

travellers to abandon the Mexican route to Cuba and turn
to.the longer and far more expensive route via Prague.
