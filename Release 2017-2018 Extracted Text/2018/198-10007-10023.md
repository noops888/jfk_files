NOTE FOR MR. VANCE

Attached is copy of Second Progress Report of the Sub-

committee on Cuban Subversion. The Services and ASD/ISA have

concurred in this report with a few minor nonsubstantive sugges.-

tions (these are noted in ink).

â€¢ CIA and USIA have concurred. State, however, has objected

on the grounds that certain actions have been taken with respect to

the Alerting System without sufficient authority.

Another meeting of the Subcommittee has been scheduled for

Friday afternoon in order to resolve this difference. I plan to attend

and will report any substantive actions.

PROGRESS ACHIEVED DURING APRIL IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1. The Department of State has:

a. Participated in the drafting of a resolution passed at

the 3-4 April Managua Meeting respecting discouragement of

travel of Latin Americans to Cuba for training in subversion.

The text of the resolution is appended hereto.

b. Headed an interdepartmental team currently visiting the

Isthmian capitals whith the objective of securing the fullest

and quickest implementation of all the recommendations agreed

on at Managua. Prior to the departure of the team, Department

of State posts were instructed to inform the host governments

of the trip and to encourage them to identify the kinds and

extent of technical assistance it would be most useful for the

United States to furnish.

c. Caused to be noted in U.S. passports since 1 April

that they are not valid for travel to Cuba.

d. Following an indication that the Bolivian Government

might be willing to increase efforts to impede travel of its

nationals to Cuba, instructed the U.S. Embassy to recommend

that the GOB:

1) Ban travel to Cuba by Bolivian nationals except

for official or special purposes approved by the GOB,

and establish legal penalties for violations;

2) Require Bolivian citizens to have a passport or

other GOB document to travel abroad;

3) Make such document invalid for travel to Cuba unless

specially endorsed;

4) Seek arrangements with third countries which are

Important transit points under which third countries will

assist the GOB in preventing unauthorized travel by Bolivians

and will help identify violators.

e) Drawing on the recommendation in the paper on "The

Movement of Subversives and Subversive Trainees" and other

sources; instructed the non-isthmian posts to encourage host

governments to take additional counter-subversion steps.

Each instruction was tailored to the local situation 1n

the recipient country and included appropriate suggestions

as to strategy which might be used in securing implementation

of the desired actions.

P)e Requested posts In Latin America to encourage host

governments to take appropriate measures to discourage

participation of their nationals in Cuba's May Day cele-

bration and to prevent charter flights from their country

to Cuba for the celebration.

g? Through efforts with various Latin American and other

governments, discouraged participation in the Cuban solid-

arity Congress. U.s. efforts contributed to limiting the

success of the Congress from the Castro-Communist point of

view.

2. The Department of Defense has:

a. Continued the US sea and air surveillance of the

area surrounding Cuba unt1l 25 April 1963, at the same

rate and with the same emphasis as existed prior to that

date. Since 25 April 1963 additional sea surveillance

has been realized between Cuba and Haiti, due to the

stationing of the Caribbean Ready Amphibious Squadron at

the entrance of the Gulf of Gonaives occasioned by the

deterioration of internal conditions within Haiti.

Reports of subversive movement, or suspected subversive

movement, obtained by US survelllance are available for

Immediate transmittal through the US military alerting

system

b. Continued action, at high priority, on the install-

ation of military communications facilities in Latin America.

As of 1 April, a

commercial submarine cable from Florida

to Panama became operational. This cable gives reliable

voice and teletype communications to CINCARIB including

both classified teletype and voice. Negotiations are

continuing in Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador for the

installation of military radio facilities.

Installation

of a multi-channel radio station has been completed in

Costa Rica. A similar facility in Nicaragua is scheduled

for completion by 1 July 1963.

c. Established an Intelligence Center at CARIBCOM Head-

quarters, in connection with the program of surface

surveillance of the Caribbean, for rapid processing and

dissemination to countries concerned, via the American

Ambassadors, of intelligence on the movement of subversives:

Study of the establishment of intelligence centers in the

Caribbean revealed that the Intelligence Center should be

established at Caribbean Command Headquarters and that a

center need not be established at Headquarters, Caribbean

Sea Frontier.

d. Established on 11 April a U.S, military alerting

system operated by CINCARIB and CINCLANT. Pursuant to the

request of the Interdepartmental. Coordinating Committee on

Cuban Affairs the Department of Defense has suspended the use

of the Military Groups in the alerting system and is working

with CIA to reduce duplication of effort to a minimum.

e. Alerted U.S, forces, for the most part within the

Atlantic Command, to be prepared to provide U.S, assistance

in the final interception of shipping in territorial waters

3 The Central Intelligence Agency has:

a. Completed its efforts to improve U.S. government

communications in Latin America by the installation of

the remaining two commercial leased circuits into

Guatemala City and Managua, and the stationing on a

permanent basis of

CIA radio operators in Latin

America in replacement of temporary duty personnel:

in October 1962 to 15,000,000 groups handled in March

1963.

b. Increased its efforts designed to control the move-

ment of persons, arms and propaganda materials to and

from Cuba.

A summary of actions by country is provided

below:

1) Argentina - Station, in conjunction with the

Embassy, has continued to press the Argentine govern-

ment to enact effective travel control legislation

and to adopt measures recommended by the Special CONSULTATIUE COMMITTEE

ON Security Cc

amittee of the DAS. Information on

Argentines travelling to Cuba is being furnished to

the Argentine government by the station.

Several

potential travellers to Cuba have been spotted and

are being assessed by the station. Information from

three recent returnees from Cuba is being obtained

through debriefings. Station reports that because of

increased Mexican controls, all truly clandestine

travel to Cuba from Argentina is now via Prague.

Che

Guevara's mother was arrested on 23 April upon her

return to Argentina for importing Castro propaganda.

2) Bolivia - Station and Embassy have been urging

Bolivian government to adopt stricter travel controls,

without apparent results

so far.

Names of travellers

known to have returned from Cuba are being furnished

to the Bolivian government.

Thus far, no action is

known to have been taken by the Bolivian government on

the strength of such information. Station comments that

problem with Bolivia is not in lack of information

available to government on Cuban subversion, but in

getting Bolivia to do something about it.

3) Brazil - Information on Brazilians who have

received subversive training in Cuba has been made

available to the Brazilian Foreign Office, through the

American Ambassador, and to the National Security

Council through CIA liaison with the NSC's Security

Service.

An asset of the CIA station in Rio is in a position

to harass and delay. Cuba-bound travellers in those

instances where the Station is able to tip him off

regarding their destination. He can also harass

returnees when informed in advance.

The Station is

taking steps to get appropriate information

to him

promptly.

4) Chile - Chilean internal security authorities,

at urging of

station, are trying to impede and harass

travellers to and from Cuba. Government is now requiring

passport applicants to state destination, and passports

must be turned in after travel. The Foreign Minister

has stated much progress is being made, with cooperation

of the Mexican government, and that travel of Chileans to

Cuba has been dramatically. reduced in recent.weeks.

Station and Embassy are continuing pressure on Cuban

government in this regard. Names of travellers to Cuba

are being passed to the Ambassador, who furnishes them

to President Alessandri (who has asked

that this collab

oration be

kept secret): Information from CIA unilateral

operations against Cuban Embassy is. being used by a newly

created Chilean surveillance. team. in checking

A Cuban

First Secretary was declared personal non grata during

April for using false identity documents, and the Cuban

charge d'affaires was

subsequently recalled by his own

government.

5) Colombia - Chief: of Customs has indicated to station

his willingness

to institute an improved travel control

system.

One station asset expects to travel to. Cuba

in the near future.

Station believes

it has identified

a courier operating between Colombia and Cuba and has

mounted an operation to uncover his Colombian contacts.

6) Costa Rica - Station reports little pro-Castro

activity during April. No recorded travel to or from

Cuba has taken place. Local authorities appear inclinea

to cooperate in control program.

7) Dominican Republic - EffÃ¶rts to get Juan Bosch to

â€¢take active steps against Communists and travellers to

and from Cuba have been fruitless to date, as have been

efforts to establish a new and effective internal security

organization in the Dominican Republic. Bosch appears

to have lost his

previously stated enthusiasm for such

a service, but efforts to

persuade him to approve a

proposed budget for the service are continuing.

version has changed from apathy to genuine concern.

separate from the passport, but the government's practice

no visa if in transit. The government continues to

confiscate propaganda material from Cuba sporadically at
