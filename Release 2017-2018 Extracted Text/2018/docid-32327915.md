ADMINISTRATIVE (CONT' D)

It is to be further noted that, based upon

information supplied by NY 169-0 to the effect that

LOUIS GUIGA was a downtown, East Side

Manhattan "button

Nostra" since it was initially belleved that BONANNO 's

territorial allocation within the organization included

the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

Subsequent investigation, however, has determined

that territorial rights relative to the Lower East Side

of Manhattan are not assigned exclusively to one particu

lar "family".

In view of this development and that fact that

NY 169-C has expressed the belief that GUIGA operates

with and under SOLLY BURNS (SALVATORE GRANELLO, who

has been identified as a member of the VITO GENOVESE

"family"', LOUIS CHARLES GUIGA 18 now being considered

a member of the VITO GENOVESE "family".

Information set forth in instant report under

the caption "E. HANGOUTS AND PLACES FREQUENTED" indicating

the Rex Bar and Grill, Grand Street,

Manhattan, was owned

by an uncle of LOUIS GUIGA, is located in case

captioned

"NATHAN KLEMAS, was., ET AL; TFIS", NY 15-10144-130,
