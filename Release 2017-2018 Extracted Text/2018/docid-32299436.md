He advised that MATTY GIORDANO, on an occasion within the
past couple of years when ROSSELLI was at La Scala Restaurant
stated that ROSSELLI was born in the same town, Avellino, as
were his, GIORDANO's parents and that ROSSELLI is not his
true name. GIORDANO mentioned ROSSELLI's true name to LEON

Italian name that had "rhythm."
