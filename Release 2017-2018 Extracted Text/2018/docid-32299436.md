Los Angeles apartment on 4/17, 18 or 19/63. Fisur has dis-

Friar's Club in Beverly Hills on 4/17/63.

On 4/17/63 this

source engaged in conversation with MORRIE SUESS (phonetic)

and MATTIE GORDANO (phonetic) who source knew as the former

maltre de at La Scala Restaurant in Beverly H1lls. SUESS

related that he had a movie script which concerned the story

of a priest in Italy.

He said he had discussed this script

with ROSSELLI and ROSSELLI told DUEsS to bring the script

to him when he had it in final form and he would look it

over.

GORDANO (phonetic) then remarked that ROSSELLI

"comes from the same town my parents come from -- a small

town outside of Naples called Avellino."

SUESS and LA 4268-6

then remarked that they thought ROSSELLI was born in Chicago.

There upon GORDANO said nothing more concerning this matter.

on 4/19/63 GEAN LEON, owner of La Scala Restaurant,

and a former top echelon informant (of the Los Angeles Office)

advised that

MATTY GIORDANO, aka Mathew Michael Jordan,

Matty Action, was formerly employed by him, LEON, as a waiter.
