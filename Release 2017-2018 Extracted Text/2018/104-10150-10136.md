cation: of: reasonable judgment. .Conclusions are drawn from’

Summary of Case

The -NOSENKO case opened.on 5 June 1962:°in the corridors
of the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations
Disarmament Conference. A Soviet official approached an
American diplomat with the suggestion that they get together
forva'talk the following day. The diplomat advised CIA of
the appointment, explaining that he thought the approach: so

a'member of the Soviet. Disarmament Delegation.

: Later meeting with the American diplomat, the Soviet

» official identified himself as NOSENKO.and-stated he was a
KGB counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensure ‘the:
security of the Soviet delegation. He knew that the American

» had: previously’ served in Moscow and erroneously believed that

“he was the “American Rezident" in Geneva. NOSENKO stated
that. he needed approximately 900. Swiss francs: immediately to
cover KGB operational funds which he had squandered on
liquor and a prostitute: in Geneva... He offered for this amount
to sell two items of information: to American Intelligence.
These were the identity ‘of ‘a former American Embassy. employee
in: Moscow who was a KGB agent "near ciphers" in the Washington
area, and the identity of .a Soviet in Moscow who, although
ostensibly a CIA agent, was actually controlled by. the. KGB, 7
In reply, the American explained that: he was not an intelli-
gence officer, but that.he could place NOSENKO in contact
with. an appropriate U.S. official in Geneva later that, same
day. 5 a : S

That: evening NOSENKO wag met by a CIA officer and a.three-
hour meeting followed at a CIA safehouse in Geneva. Describing
himself ‘as a KGB major experienced in operations against. the

travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO.told the CIA officer
of his financial difficulties and repeated his offér to sell

the two items of‘information. He said that the need tor money
was his immediate mocive for contacting Cla, although in the
ensuing discussion he aiso expressed dissatisfaction with the
Communist regime in the Soviet Union-

NOSENKO met CIA‘ representatives four more times in Geneva
in June 1962. With the second meeting on 11 June, his earlier
expressed reservations disappeared almost entirely. He
answered most questions put to him on KGB organization and
operations. His knowledgeability was almost exciusively
limited to the KGB Second Chief Directorate (responsible for
counterintelligence and security within che USSR). NOSENKO
seemed to be what he claimed to pe: a KGB officer ina
sensitive position with knowledge of important KGB operations.

NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June, having promised
to do everything within certain limits to collect information
on matters indicated to be of interest to CIA. The only
restrictions he placed on his cooperation were his absolute
refusal to permit operational contact with him inside the
USSR and his request that no mention of his coilaboration be
communicated to the American Embassy in Moscow. He promised
to notify CIA via an accommodation address when he came to
the West again. ,

NOSENKO again accompanied the Soviet delegation to the
Disarmament Conference in Geneva in January 1964. Since last
meeting with CIA he had been promoted to the rank of lieu-
tenant colonel and had become the Deputy Chief of the largest
department in the Second Chief Directorate. At the first
of the new series of meetings on 23 January he announced
that he had decided to defect to the United States. He
cited as reasons his continuing dissatisfaction with the
Soviet regime and the fact. that he probably would have no
further opportunities to travel to the West in the foresee-
able future. Although he implied that he wanted to defect
as soon as possible, he agreed to remain in place in Geneva
while arrangements for his reception were being made in
Washington. NOSENKO had brought a large amount of new
information, much of it in scribbled notes, on KGB opera-
tional activity which he had collected in the 18 months
since his last meeting with CIA-

(Summary of. Case)

On'4 February, four days before the date tentatively
selected for NOSENKO's: defection, he reported that he had
received a cable from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate

Uxeturn to Moscow to. participate in a KGB conference’ on
foreign tourism to the Soviet. Union. -That night exfiltration
Plans were ‘implemented and NOSENKO was driven across the
border to Germany where his debriefing was resumed in a
‘Frankfurt safehouse. The decision was reached: on 11 February
to bring NOSENKO to the United States, and in the early
evening of .12 February: he’ and. his CIA escorts arrived in
Washington via commercial aircraft,. thence to a safehouse

At the request of. the Swiss: and Soviet Governments,
-*NOSENKO met-on 14 February. with representatives of their
respective Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.s,

a CCIA completed its’ initial debriefings of NOSENKO-on
218 February, and.on 24 February. he was introduced to
‘representatives’ of the FBI for questioning. At about the
same time, there was a marked change in NOSENKO's comport
ment. “While outwardly cooperative during most debriefing
sessions, -it. became increasingly difficult to get him to
/-kespond to specific questioning. His free time in Washington
“and nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bouts, crude:
behavior, and disputes with his security escort. He’ explained - ;
his behavior by saying that he was under. great tension as. ce
,@ result of his defection, abandonment of his wife and 3
. ‘children; and the’ disgrace that he had brought to his family
“i mame, and-on this. basis CIA accéded to NOSENKO's demand for
“a vacation: On 12 March, NOSENKO left Washington with a
CIA case officer and two CIA security guards for a two-week
visit ‘to Hawaii. There his behavior. deterioriated still
further. “He drank heavily and almost constantly; he =

Top Secret

(Summary of Case)

During NOSENKO's absence from Washington, consultations
were held with the FBI regarding steps to be taken to restrict:
his movements and activities. This Agency was concerned
that his behavior would attract undesirable atcrention and
publicity, perhaps police arrest, and that doubts about his
bona fides, which were becoming known to a widening group
in the U.S. Government, might be inadvertently revealed to
NOSENKO himself. The FBI on 1 April indicated irc would
"not interpose objection" to the CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's
. freedom of movement, and the Acting Attorney General, the
Department of State, and the White House were advised.

On 4 April NOSENKO was driven to a new safehouse in a
Washington suburb, and told that this safehouse thenceforward
would be his regular place of residence. Since that time
NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been
under full-time guard, and has not been permitted access to
news media.

Intensive interrogation of NOSENKO, including a polygraphic
examination, was begun on 4 April 1964 in order to obtain
“information which he had been reluctant to divulge earlier,
and to clarify contradictions in what he had already reported.
The polygraph examination results were inconclusive. This
phase of the interrogations was terminated on 24 April 1964.

Despite the searching nature of the questions and the
implicitly and explicitly expressed doubts of his veracity,
NOSENKO asserted that he was willing to answer, or to try to
answer all questions put to him. Because more information
pertinent to the question of his bona fides was needed, a
new series of interrogations was begun in mid-May 1964.
Different interrogators were introduced and questioning was
resumed in a neutral, non~hostile manner. The period of
neutral questioning continued until mid-November 1964.

After further consultations with the FBI, a round of
hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. Between
then and 5 March, NOSENKO was questioned for a total of
about 140 hours by individual interrogators and interrogation
teams, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous
assertions. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements
had been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions

(Summary of Case)

in his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had
been basically truthful, and that he- had come to the United
States solely for the reasons he had originally given.
These interrogations. were suspended on 5 March 1965-

Questioning of. NOSENKO during the summer and autumn of
1964 and the interrogations. of January and February 1965
concentrated on the period of his claimed service in the
American Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB
Second Chief Directorate, from January, 1960 to “January 1962: -
“Among the reasons for selecting this particular period were:
the comparatively large amount of collateral information a
available against which .NOSENKO's statements. could be checked;.”
“the importance of. the Embassy and its personnel as critical
KGB Second.Chief Directorate targets; their importance from
the standpoint of ‘American security; and the extent of
NOSENKO's claimed knowledge of the activities of the Embassy
Section, of which he claimed to. have been Deputy Chief. 4

In keeping:with a Soviet practice with which NOSENKO was
familiar, CIA: asked NOSENKO in February 1965 to sign a series.
of interrogation reports, so-called "protocols", most of
which concerned the period: of his claimed. service in ‘the *
American Department.’*| These were written by the CIA interro-
gators, and they:were designed to,set forth NOSENKO's exact: ’

“statements and meaning on. various specific subjects. The :
Protocols were in no way presented to NOSENKO ‘as documentary
portions of a."confession", but rather. as distilled and. final
Statements. of what he did and did not know concerning units

; particular topics. . NOSENKO- was asked to read each page of *
each protocol carefully and: to sign his name at’ the bottom:
to ‘indicate that he understood and agreed with its contents;
he was allowed the use: of a dictionary and was permitted to
ask any questions and make ‘any changes that he wished. ‘A
(Amendments. were: entered by the interrogators ‘and were
initialed. by NOSENKO.) —NOSENKO-was asked, after reading-
each page and after completing the entire protocol, whether
he understood what was written there and whether there were
any more. changes. he wished to make. ..He was then asked to
sign and date the statement, "I have read and understood
this report and certify it as correct", at’ the end of the
‘final page. . With one exception, he -did.so calmly and without
objections. In one or two instances he remarked that his

look foolish, but he was not able to Suggest any changes of
fact or presentation which would maké them more accurate,
Commenting on the use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said
on 4 March 1965: "My life story is absolutely correct.
Anything I have signed is absolutely correct, I absolutely
understand what I am doing when I am signing any paper

This is an officidl document, and I fully understand what
I'm doing when 1 sign it as being absolutely correct."

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until
14 August 1965 with the Participation of Petr DERYABIN, a
former KGB officer. These interrogations, held in Russian,
were for the Purpose of using DERYABIN's KGB experience to
obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's claimed personal
and professional background.

me

During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was
questioned for seven days on specific aspects of selected
tepics ranging from his identity to his involvement in and
knowledge of specific KGB operations. Questioning was in
both Russian and English. Although the interrogations
identified topics and time periods in NOSENKO's accounts
which contained the greatest number of contradictions and
discrepancies, neither the contradictions nor the discrep-
ancies could be resolved.

Because of the incidence of deranged persons CIA has
encountered among would~be defectors, the question of
NOSENKO's mental stability was a matter considered early
after his defection in Geneva. From his arrival in the
United States in 1964 NOSENKO has been under psychiatric
observation. A CIA Psychiatrist and a CIA psychologist
both with extensive experience with Soviet Bloc defectors,
monitored many of NOSENKO's interrogations. In May 1965
the psychologist for three weeks questioned NOSENKO on his
life from birth until 1953, when NOSENKO claimed he joined
the KGB, in an attempt to identify psychological factors
which might underlie NOSENKO's contradictory and inconsistent
accounts. The psychiatrist has continued his periodic
observations of NOSENKO to the present time. The psychiatrist
and the psychologist concluded independently, on the basis
of their observations, that NOSENKO was mentally stable.

CHAPTER I

FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS

Evidence of NOSENKO's bona Fides is comprised of his own
Statements, the corroborating statements of Soviet officials,
and the counterintelligence information he has provided.

NOSENKO's Statements About Himself

In his meetings in 1962 and 1964 with CIA abroad and in
the course of the interrogations since, NOSENKO has’ made
numerous statements about himself. More than any other,
however, a statement written in July 1964 (after the initial
hostile interrogation was concluded) is a thoughtful and
well-expressed exposition of how he wished CIA to regard
him. It is quoted here in its entirety.

My life, my childhood and youth passed in very
comfortable circumstances since the position of
my father gave us the opportunity to live without
lacking for anything. And the only difficult
periods of my life before the death of my father
were at the naval schools attended in Kuybyshev,
Baku and Leningrad, and at the beginning of my
working life, when I was in the Far East in 1950-
1952. The opportunity. to be always well-dressed,
to have a sufficient amount of money, to have my
own car, to be able to use the car given me by my

successes, when in fact they didn't exist, the
figures about how the USSR had passed the USA in
the production of butter and milk, when in the
stores they were available only infrequently. The
endless promises of a better life when in fact
nothing of the sort is taking place. All this
similarly forced me to re-evaluate not only the
events which were taking place in the country, but
already the entire ideology of the Party, its
external and internal course.

The events in Novocherkassk where 20,000 to
25,000 people rose up and the way in which this
popular indignation was suppressed by troops with
many casualties, This also made a deep impression
on me. When I was resting in the summer of 1961
in Nikolayev, from my relatives--my father's
brothers--I understood well the real relation of
the workers both to the leadership and to the.
Party as a whole. At the same time I saw how the
workers really lived, how they eat, what they have
and what they can buy with their wages.

I heard a great deal from my father about the
domestic pdlicies of Khrushchev in regard to the
development and the course of construction in
industry, about his complete illiteracy in
engineering technology and industrial economics,
about incorrect decisions in regard to many
industries, and this was not only the opinion of
my father, but also of other important leaders in
various fields of industry. But no one dared to
open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father
tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain
decision would be incorrect, he received such a
rebuff from Khrushchev that he was profoundly
shaken and in the opinion of my mother this brought
him to his illness and death in August 1956.

The events in Germany and especially in Hungary
showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy of
communist ideology. What was especially important
for me was the fact that in these countries it was a
protest not of individuals or groups, but of the

I entered the Komsomol completely without thinking
about it. The time came, the right age, and I
became a Komsomol member like all the others. It
was different in regards to the Party: I joined
: the Party in: 1956 after the death of Stalin and
i while I was working in the KGB and already at that
i time there was a lack of faith and indecisiveness
in me. My father continually insisted on this,
q saying that without the Party I would never move

ahead and would not have success in life. But I
myself understood and saw that I would not be able

to work in the KGB unless I was a member of the

Party. And if I worked somewhere else, I would

truly never move ahead in my career unless I entered
the Party. But from the very beginning of my entry
into the Party, I deeply hated all the Party talmudism
and dogmatism. All the Party meetings were literally
a torture. Especially when I became the Deputy:

f Chief and then Chief of a section, and then Deputy

Chief of a department, because then I had to speak
at these meetings. Because this meant to lie, to
twist my soul, and to attempt to show myself as
deeply dedicated to the Party and its course.

In 1960 my oldest girl's asthmatic attacks became
worse. The question of a change of climate was
raised. At that time the Second Chief Directorate
needed to send an officer to Ethiopia for two to
three years to conduct counterintelligence work
among the Soviet specialists there. It cost me a
great deal of effort to personally talk Second Chief
Directorate Chief General GRIBANOV into letting me
go. The Party and work references had been confirmed,
all the questionnaires were already filled out, the
photos had been submitted; that is, all the formal-
ities had been accomplished. But at the very last
moment the Central Personnel Office of the KGB began
to protest against my going with my family to
Ethiopia. The reason for this was that from the
house check made at my place of residence they
received information that I sometimes came home in
a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels
with my wife. A tour abroad with my family was
necessary because of the health of my daughter

If the defections of [former KGB officers] PETROV,
RASTVOROV and DERYABIN passed without evoking any
particular thoughts, the defection to the United
States of GOLITSYN, whom I had heard of as an
intelligent person and a capable officer, undoubtedly
caused me to think very deeply. Because to act thus,
it is necessary to have not only boldness and
decisiveness, but also great strength of will. And
already I put to myself the question, will I be able
to act thus in view of the dissatisfactions and
disillusionments which had accumulated inside of me?

Being in Geneva in 1962, not long before my
departure I myself of my own desire entered into
contact with you. The reason for this was the loss
of money received by me for operational expenses.

I would have been unable to accumulate such a sum

of money before my departure and there was nobody

to borrow from. To tell the truth about the loss

of the money would have meant that it would be
necessary to explain where and in what circumstances
it had been lost. This would have risked expulsion
from the KGB and a serious reprimand from the Party.
Not to tell the truth, to think up some sort of a
story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of all, they
might think that I had appropriated the money, that
is, stolen it. And this would be for me the worst
of all and I would, of course, in such event have
told the truth.

| To tell the truth, it was only after my return

home from Geneva in 1962 that I gradually, not

immediately, began full to realize all'the seriousness

of my contact with you and its full meaning. And

although I-did not give you any promises or assurances

about our continued contact in the future, I under-

stood that you sooner or later would set yourself

the task of continuing our contact. And here it was

that weighing up all the reasons and causes which I

| have indicated above that in 1962 I took for myself
the decision to leave the USSR at the first opportunity
and that I started to work towards being sent on a

learn of my contact with you. This article deeply
‘interested’ the KGB.

During ‘the closed trial of PENKOVSKIY I got a
pass from the Second Department and went, in order
to look at him myself. For sometimes it is enough
to simply look at a man, to see how he holds himself
and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort
of an initial opinion of him. Personally, I liked
how PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked
his appearance and I understood that everything
which had been said in the KGB about him and the
sort of person they were trying to make him out to
be (that he was morally degraded, that he had
descended and sunk into a swamp) that all this was
nonsense, bluff, and.chatter. And PENKOVSKIY, the
same as GOLITSYN, gave me a feeling of greater
confidence in the correctness of the decision taken
by me to leave the Soviet Union.

defector NOSENKO was the son of the decéased Minister, he
served: over a decade in the KGB,his personal shortcomings
were overcome through’ the patronage of KGB General. GRIBANOV,

The Product of NOSENKO's Debriefing
v

Positive Intelligence Information

At his first meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO asserted
that he was acquainted with Ministers of the Soviet Govern-
ment, who were friends of his father, and he heard what
was said in their circles. His debriefing and interroga-
tions did not bear out his assertion that he was informed
of the attitudes and aims of the Soviet leaders. His
responses to questions about the viability -of the then
Soviet Government, for example, were couched in vague and
general terms and did not reflect any specific knowledge.
From his debriefing it emerged that NOSENKO had spent his
entire adult life either as a student or as a state security
official, and he stressed that since the early 1950's he
had had few interests and "no real contacts" outside of the
KGB itself. Questioned on a wide range of topics, including
various aspects of nuclear weaponry, missiles, electronics,
communications, unconventional weapons, military industry,
military units and equipment, and research and development,
NOSENKO repeatedly said that he had no knowledge of such
matters and that his responses reflected only personal
opinions. Because of his two assignments to Geneva with
the Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference, questions
were put to NOSENKO about Soviet underground testing, Soviet
efforts in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,
Soviet disarmament aims and Soviet views of the corresponding
attitudes and intentions of the United States. Becausé
his assignments ‘to the Soviet Disarmament Delegation were
for cover purposes only, NOSENKO disclaimed any special
knowledge. He explained that he took no part in the
substantive work of the Delegation nor did he have any
connection in the USSR with officials or organizations
concerned with arms control or disarmament policies.

NOSENKO's failure to provide any useful positive
intelligence information was not unique, although previous
KGB defectors did not have NOSENKO's claimed access, either
on the basis of his family ties or on the basis of his KGB
counterintelligence position within the Soviet Union. KGB

Mrs. JOHNSON, and James Allen MINTKENBAUGH. Twenty-five of
this number acknowledged KGB recruitment before or after
NOSENKO's information was received. In fifteen other
instances NOSENKO's information has been corroborated in
part by the individuals' admissions of contact with (if
not recruitment by) the KGB, or by other sources' reports
of their recruitment. Besides these 51, NOSENKO provided
leads to four other American KGB agents, including an
officer in an American military intelligence organization,
none of whom has: yet been identified. Lastly, NOSENKO
identified 22 Americans whom the KGB knew or suspected to
be American Intelligence agents.

From NOSENKO's information 68 non-American KGB agents
have been identified. Although investigations are still
incomplete, in 39 of these cases the individual's KGB
recruitment has been reported by other sources, or the
individuals were suspect for,other reasons... Among these
68 individuals were al dor to
Moscow, an Austrian and an afl
Director and a-Deputy Secretary of the Foreigni/
Ministry, and a British Admiralty employee (William VASSALL,
see below). In addition, NOSENKO provided leads on 22 other
KGB foreign agents, yet to be identified. NOS. 's infor-
mation about the KGB electronic attack on the Embassy||
in Moscow was confirmed by subsequent technical and physical
search.

With respect to the KGB itself, NOSENKO named (if not
completely identified) approximately 1,000 Soviet citizens
who are or have been affiliated with Soviet intelligence
and security organizations. These included over seven
hundred active KGB staff officers, of whom 435 were serving
in the Second Chiéf Directorate. Of the 165 KGB officers
he named as belonging to the First Chief (Foreign Intelli-

shown to Premier Khrushchev personally. Although still
active, the agent had lost access to classified documents
some months earlier, in 1963. NOSENKO characterized the
lead as the most important single counterintelligence item
that he acquired during the year and a half he was a CIA
collaborator at KGB Headquarters in Moscow.

NOSENKO's Information

Shortly after returning to Moscow from Geneva in 1962,
NOSENKO first learned of a KGB agent's successful penetra-
tion of a classified documents vault at an “important
American military installation" in the Paris area. Because
the documents included information on strategic targets in
France as well as in the Soviet Union, he assumed that it
was a "strategic planning installation". The installation
had its own airfield and that there were "procedures for
bringing Top Secret documents in and for taking them out".

There had been six successful entries of the vault, four
in 1962 and two in 1963, On each occasion Special Section
technicians travelled TDY to Paris under diplomatic courier
cover to assist the local KGB case officer in the technical
details of the operation. Their function was to advise the
case officer concerning the entry’ to the vault and later
surreptitiously to unwrap and re~seal the documents. The
case officer, on this basis, would give appropriate instruc-
tions to his agent, and the technicians probably never met
the American.

Although this was a First Chief Directorate operation,
officers of the Special Section of the Second Chief
Directorate were used. . The.Special Section was comprised
of technicians transferred from the KGB Operational-
Technical Directorate, and usually it handled surreptitious
entries to Western embassies in Moscow. Among these officers
were S.A. IONOV, L.A. LEBEDEV, S.D. ILYIN, V.V. SINITSYN,
V.Z. KARETNIKOV, M.I. PREOBRAZHENSKIY and Fedor FOFANOV.
IONOV, LEBEDEV and ILYIN took part in this operation, and
FOFANOV was later involved.

The specialists were not the ones that carried out the
operation. It was carried out by the case officers of the
Paris Legal Residency. The specialists just opened and then

The last time the vault was entered was in the fall of
1963. At about that time the agent, a military man,
received a promotion and was relieved of his night watch
duties. (The agent was scheduled for rotation to the
United States but, with his promotion, he had obtained an
extension until May 1964.) Although the agent was still
active in January 1964 and was still assigned to the same
military post, he had lost access to the classified
documents. The information obtained from the agent's vault
was highly sensitive and so valuable to the KGB that the
Paris Legal Rezident as well as several case officers there
had been rewarded for their part in the operation.

Before leaving Moscow for Geneva in January 1964,
NOSENKO had been told that the technician FOFANOV had been
sent to Paris in the KGB hope that the agent would be able
to re-enter the vault again before his transfer to the
United States in May. When NOSENKO visited the Soviet
Embassy in-Paris on 19 January 1964 while‘en route to
Geneva, FOFANOV was on duty at the entrance and NOSENKO

“chatted with him. FOFANOV said he “was not doing good"
and he "would probably be sitting there until May", but
he had hopes "that something might happen".

The American agent was getting paid by the KGB and he
was recruited with the promise of a substantial sum of
money. NOSENKO didn't know if he was recruited in Paris
or if it was even a formal recruitment, nor what.plans the
KGB had for him after he left Paris.

NOSENKO learned of the case “in little pieces" at
separate times from various members of the Second Chief
Directorate Special Section who participated in it,
principally LEBEDEV or KARETNIKOV in Moscow, and FOFANOV
later in Paris. | [Under intensive questioning, NOSENKO has
also alleged he learned of the case from IONOV, the Chief
of the Special Section.] NOSENKO explained that he knew
LEBEDEV and KARETNIKOV from their visit to his office to
discuss technical installations at new tourist hotels, when
NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

relevant intelligence of any significance. NOSENKO thought
that "SASHA" served as a department chief in intelligence
when he was re-assigned to Germany in November 1962 - early
1963.

NOSENKO met SHALYAPIN for the first time in September or
October 1962 [after NOSENKO's first visit to Geneva and
initial contact with CIA] through his friend, Yu. I. GUK.
GUK had known SHALYAPIN when they had served together in
the First Chief Directorate in Moscow. SHALYAPIN had
served in the United States, Uruguay, Berlin, and Cuba. In
1962 he had been assigned to the Latin American Department
of the First Chief Directorate, as a case officer. He
retired from the KGB and through NOSENKO's intervention with
Second Chief Directorate Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
SHALYAPIN obtained a position with Inturist. Presumably
out of gratitude to NOSENKO, SHALYAPIN felt free to talk,
and over drinks he expressed his bitterness at his treat-
ment by the First Chief Directorate which, without hin,
would not have had the agent "SASHA" in Germany “at that
time". [1963]. NOSENKO heard such details as.he knew. of
"SASHA" in.the course of several such talks with SHALYAPIN.

Under intensive questioning on the "SASHA" case NOSENKO
retracted his statement that he had first heard of the case
from SHALYAPIN, though maintaining that he was sure he had
discussed the case with-SHALYAPIN "at some time". Pressed
to identify his first source, NOSENKO then cited several
officers-~-some First Chief Directorate, some Second-who
could have told him about it. because they were likely to
know of it though none of, them was actually involved in the
operation. Ultimately NOSENKO refused to commit himself
on this point, saying he did not remember from whom he first
learned of "SASHA". : F i:

"ANDREY" (Dayle W. SMITH)

When contacting CIA in 1962 NOSENKO offered to sell
information about two KGB operations, one of which he knew
only under the KGB cryptonym "ANDREY", a KGB agent recruited
in Moscow in 1949 or 1950 who in 1962 was working in
Washington “near ciphers".

NOSENKO's Information~1962

“ANDREY" was a U.S. Army sergeant who was spotted for the
KGB by "QUEBEC" (Roy RHODES). [RHODES served in Moscow
from April 1951 to July 1953. He dated his own recruitment
by the KGB as January 1952.] RHODES was still in Moscow
when "ANDREY" was recruited by the Second Chief Directorate,
although RHODES was not aware of "ANDREY's" recruitment.

The KGB approach to “ANDREY" was based on “women and money".

“ANDREY' worked satisfactorily in Moscow for the KGB,
providing "materials" and information on ciphers. He
promised that he would cooperate with the- KGB in future
assignments abroad, but would not work with them in the

_ United States as he did not want to "sit in the electric

chair". He was paid well for his cooperation in Moscow.

The KGB wanted to pay him more but he refused; he said he
could not plausibly explain the possession of too much
money. When the KGB offéred him diamonds and other gems for
later sale, he did not take them, telling his case officers
that possession could arouse the attention of the American
police. In 1950 the agent left Moscow for the United
States. The KGB waited for him to reappear in some other
country, but he did not. Finally, in 1955, the KGB sent
V.M. KOVSHUK, the then-Chief of the American Embassy Section
of the Second Chief Directorate, and a participant in.
"ANDREY's" recruitment in Moscow, to the United States to
find the agent. KOVSHUK travelled under the alias "KOMAROV",
under the cover of either Second or Third Secretary of the
Soviet Embassy in Washington.

RHODES. Little by little, however, "ANDREY" resumed his
meetings with the KGB, "having little other choice".

KOVSHUK turned "ANDREY" over to a member of the Washington
Legal Residency and returned to Moscow. NOSENKO did not
know who succeéded KOVSHUK as the handler, but KOVSHUK's
successor eventually turned the case over to N.G. BAGRICHEV,
who concluded his tour in Washington in 1961. NOSENKO. did
not know BAGRICHEV's successor, but asserted that there
must have been one since. “ANDREY" was still working with
the KGB in 1962.

NOSENKO's Information-1964

While continuing to associate "ANDREY's" recruitment
with RHODES' presence in Moscow, NOSENKO in different
discussions of the case asserted that. "ANDREY" was recruited
in "1948-1949", “in'1952 or earlier", or "in 1953".

“ANDREY" had been recruited by KOVSHUK and N.M. BORODIN.
After returning to the United States, "ANDREY" worked at
the Pentagon, "in codes", but by the time KOVSHUK recontacted
him in the United States he was néaring the end of his
enlistment, and he was working.in an Army recruiting office.
He was still working in the recruiting office when BAGRICHEV
took over the case from KOVSHUK. —

It was not RHODES' trial at which “ANDREY" appeared, but
he was among persons called during the pre-trial investigation.
“ANDREY" was called just once, and he was scared ‘to death.
“ANDREY" did not testify at the RHODES trial.

In Moscow, "ANDREY" had explained to the KGB how the code
machines in the Embassy-worked and may have given the KGB
parts of code machines such as "dises" [sic, meaning rotors].
Aleksandr SELEZNEV, a deputy department chief-in the
Communications Directorate of the KGB, had been involved in
the “ANDREY" case: ‘NOSENKO first saw him in 1953 during the
period that "ANDREY" was working for the KGB in Moscow.
SELEZNEV came to meetings in the American Department to
discuss and plan KGB meetings with "ANDREY". The reason for
SELEZNEV's presence was that the case officers were not
technical specialists, and SELEZNEV would supply them with

NOSENKO "cannot be certain" that he did not

Edward Ellis SMITH
NOSENKO's Information

In. the context of a-1962 discussion of KGB operations
against the American Embassy in Moscow, NOSENKO was asked
whether he knew "about SMITH". ‘He answered: "SMITH?. The
red-head. Listen, he headed the FBI, he.was a colonel and
headed counterintelligence." NOSENKO went on to describe
the mounting of a blackmail operation, of which he was
the. case officer, against SMITH (whose KGB cryptonym was
“"RYZHIY", or "REDHEAD").

SMITH had been sleeping with his Russian housemaid, who
was an agent planted on him by the KGB. When the KGB was
unable to obtain actual incriminating photographs, she was
instructed to take photographs of herself on SMITH's bed.
These were then combined with photographs of SMITH to
produce photomontages, copies of which were delivered to
SMITH together with a letter inviting him to a meeting with
the KGB. SMITH came. The KGB was represented at. the
meeting. by GRIBANOV, NOSENKO and one other officer. At
this initial meeting SMITH was not interrogated nor asked
for classified information. SMITH agreed to come to further

meetings.

(FOUNDATION OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

When SMITH did not come to the next scheduled meeting
with GRIBANOV, NOSENKO sought out the maid to find out what
had happened. She reported that SMITH was in a state of
desperate indecision; he had paced his room all night as
if his mood was alternating between despair and defiance.

To increase the pressure on him, the KGB sent him threatening
letters on each of the succeeding three days. Finally, on
the third day, instead of meeting the KGB, SMITH went to
Ambassador BOHLEN and reported the blackmail attempt. SMITH
was immediately withdrawn from Moscow and (as of 1962) he

was "still in intelligence work".

In 1964 and afterwards NOSENKO denied that he had played
any personal role in the case. He explained that as a
junior officer in the American Embassy Section at the time,
working on correspondents, he would not have taken part in
so important an operation. He said that he had heard about
the operation from V. M. KOVSHUK, SMITH's case officer.

(On a later occasion NOSENKO said that his only personal
role was being assigned to a phone-watch to receive
surveillance reports connected with the initial KGB approach
to SMITH.)

> GOLITSYN's Information

In February 1962 GOLITSYN reported that in 1957 he had
read a two-volume KGB study which gave examples of successful
operations against the Embassy in Moscow. One case concerned
an American, probably single, who was either the Security
Officer or the counterintelligence representative in‘the
Embassy. He had a dog, .and lived in an apartment in the
city or a country house outside Moscow. His Russian maid
or cleaning.’ woman was his mistress. The KGB concluded that
the American would not, succumb’ to ordinary blackmail and
consequently the maid, a KGB agent, was instructed to confess
to him that she had been recruited by the KGB against her
will and would be arrested if she did not fulfill her KGB
tasks. The American agreed to help her, and GOLITSYN believed
that he did not report this to his Washington headquarters.
GOLITSYN also recalled that the American first supplied a
only misinformation to the KGB, but when the KGB complained,
he provided a mixture of truth and misinformation. GOLITSYN
said the case study he read was based on a true incident

which took place between 1953 and 1957, but he was not sure
that the operation actually resulted in a successful recruit-
ment, as was alleged in the study.

Edward Ellis SMITH (a redhead), Embassy
Security Officer (and CIA employee) from
July 1954 to June 1956, reported to the
Ambassador on 5 June 1956 that he had received
four letters from the KGB. The first,
received on 2 June 1956, enclosed incriminating
photographs of himself and his Russian maid and
requested him to come to a personal meeting
with KGB representatives outside the Embassy.
When he did not do so, SMITH subsequently had
received three threatening letters. In
reporting the matter to the Ambassador, SMITH
admitted having been intimate with his Russian
maid. SMITH was recalled from Moscow on
8 June 1956, and he left CIA employment a year
later. When interviewed in March 1962 on the
basis of the GOLITSYN information, SMITH
admitted that he had maintained his affair
with the Russian maid during most of the time
of his Moscow assignment, 20 July 1954 to
8 June 1956, and confirmed that to help her
he had in fact passed unclassified information
through her to the KGB for many months.
NOSENKO clearly ascribed the SMITH operation
to the period when NOSENKO was in the American
Embassy Section, in 1953-1955. SMITH's state-
ment that he reported the blackmail attempt to
the Ambassador in June 1956 is confirmed. If
NOSENKO was, as he says, transferred to the
Seventh Department in 1955, he could not have
played any role in the KGB approach to SMITH.
If he played such a role, he was in the Embassy
Section in 1956, not in the Seventh Department
as he claims. If he played a role inthe SMITH
case as well as_in the Seventh Department
recruitment of [BURGI} (see p. 115), it remains OG
possible that he was neither an officer in the
Embassy Section nor Seventh Department and was
acting in some other KGB capacity.

CHAPTER IL

EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

What NOSENKO has said about himself, the information
about the KGB which he has provided, and the apparently
corroborative statements which Soviet officials have made
since his defection represent prima facie evidence that
NOSENKO is a former senior KGB officer. To permit a
conclusive judgment that he is a bona fide defector, the
information NOSENKO provides about his life and related e
persons and events must be coherent, and his accounts of
important events must be consistent. Allowing for personal
vagaries such as lapses of memory and so forth, as well
as for factors of accident and coincidence, the information
he relates must conform within reasonable limits with that
which is known from independent and reliable sources to
the United States Government about Soviet realities and
about the events, topics and individuals NOSENKO describes.
Lastly, the information NOSENKO provides must plausibly
relate primarily to the KGB positions he held, and his
account of how he functioned in these positions must be
substantiated by verisimilar detail.

The following portions of this paper, organized in
chronological fashion insofar as possible, summarize this
examination of the significant aspects of NOSENKO's claims.

Notes for the Reader

In order to follow the examination as presented the
reader should note the following:

The examination tests the validity of the presumptive
evidence favoring NOSENKO in terms of coherence, consistency,
and compatdbility with fact and plausibility.

(EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES)

Notes for the Reader (Continued)

NOSENKO's claims are judged in the light of his own
assertions and in comparison with collateral information.
It is not the function of the examination to speculate
about possibly. credible alternative explanations for the
paradoxes reflected in NOSENKO's statements, except when
such explanations are advanced by NOSENKO himself.

If there is no immediate explanatory note pointing out
the relevance or significance of some item in the text, the
reader may expect that the item's relevance or significance
usually will be developed in the immediately-following text.
Otherwise seemingly minor points are included because of
their aggregative significance: they will be a matter of
comment in the Summary and Conclusions section following
each major portion of the examination.

Direct questions and NOSENKO's replies about his
contradictions, inconsistencies, ambiguities, retractions,
omissions and the like, are reflected in the text. Where,
during his interrogations, it was not possible to pose
direct questions without furnishing NOSENKO information or
insight into the interrogators' purposes, the topic was
covered exhaustively if indirectly, and NOSENKO was
provided every opportunity to comment on the matter in
question. When the text indicates that NOSENKO apparently

_ Was not asked about a particular matter, or that "hé didn't

say", or "didn't comment" or “didn't indicate awareness"
and so. forth, the reader properly may assume that the
Matter was covered extensively.

In instances in which NOSENKO contradicts or retracts
earlier assertions, no more weight is necessarily given
to his final assertion as opposed to earlier contrary claims.

To assist the reader in following what are sometimes
lengthy and complex accounts of events, NOSENKO's narrative
is broken from time to time by a clearly identified
editorial comment which seeks to draw the reader's attention
to the relevance or significance of NOSENKO's assertions,
or to what conclusion is drawn.

CHAPTER III

PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY

NOSENKO's biography from birth to entry into the KGB is

relevant to his bona fides insofar as it is material to

establishing his true identity, his general veracity, and

his eventual eligibility for KGB service. Below are

= summarized pertinent events in his early life, his study
at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, and
his RU service, as reconstructed from statements he
volunteered as well as from the accounts obtained in
repeated interrogations.

ant Birth to 1945 - NOSENKO's Account

aa NOSENKO was born on,30 October 1927 in Nikolayev, in the
Ukraine. At:the time of. his birth, his father, Ivan
Isidorovich NOSENKO, was a shipyard mechanic and an evening
student at the Nikolayey Shipbuilding Institute. Shortly
after NOSENKO began kindergarten in Nikolayev, in September
1934, his father graduated from the Shipbuilding Institute
and the family moved to Leningrad, where NOSENKO started
a the First Class of school in September 1935. From 1935 to
1937 NOSENKO lived in Leningrad where his. father was director
; of a shipyard. In 1938 the elder NOSENKO became Deputy
eo. People's Commissar of the Shipbuilding Industry and the
family moved to Moscow, where NOSENKO completed the Sixth
Class in June 1941 just as the war broke out.

NOSENKO has given two versions of his whereabouts for
the next two years. In one, he said that on the outbreak
of hostilities he was enrolled in the Moscow Special Naval

aa School which was evacuated to Kuybyshev where he finished
the Seventh Class; thereafter he transferred to the Lenin-
grad Naval Preparatory School (which had been evacuated to

Baku), where he finished the Fighth Class in spring, 1943.
In a second version [more probable since entry to the Moscow
Special Naval School required prior completion of the
Seventh Class] NOSENKO said that when the war broke out he
and his mother were.evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he
completed’ the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned
to Moscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the
Moscow Special Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall of 1943
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School (then in Baku).

After just six months in Baku, without completing the
Ninth Class, NOSENKO ran away from school and returned to
Moscow. -. :

Comment:  NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran
away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the
Frunze Higher Naval School, the equivalent of
Annapolis. He has retracted both assertions.

?

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval
Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku, he
resumed his studies there. Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO
received a gunshot wound in the hand, and after being
hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute
course was of four years' duration and that he entered the
Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'
duration and that because he failed a state examination he
was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'
@uration and he graduated In 1950, on scheduYe; and that it
was of five,years' duration but he failed an examination
which delayed his graduation for three months.

Comment: See p.367for report that NOSENKO joined the KGB
upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.
The duration of the Institute course and the
date of NOSENKO's completion are materiai to
the plausibility of his claimed Naval RU service,
which he said followed almost immediately upon
his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

.NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at
the Institute of International Relations he entered the
Naval RU, serving in the Far East and then in a Baltic post,
finally successfully. “transferring" to the KGB through the
intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOV.

Korea. In spring 1952 NOSENKO suddenly fell ill. Returned
to Moscow and given a medical examination, he was diagnosed
to have “a small spot on a blood vessel under his collarbone"
and he was confined to the Hertzen Sanitorium outside Moscow
for two months. In summer 1952, again eligible for duty,
NOSENKO was offered an assignment to the Military-Diplomatic
Academy, but he rejected the opportunity because the
curriculum was almost identical to that of the Institute
from which he was graduated.

In summer 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to the Baltic city of
Primorsk, "the former German city of Pillau". ([Baltiysk, a
larger city close by Primorsk, is the former German city of
Pillau.] There NOSENKO was involved in the formation of
"agent-observation posts", in which candidates from among
Soviet seamen were formed into three-man teams and trained
as stay-behind agents in the event of war. In early 1953,
after less than six months in the Baltic assignment, NOSENKO
returned on leave to Moscow where he met at his father's
dacha KGB General KOBULOV, First Deputy to then~MGB {kGB]
Chairman Beria. KOBULOV, on finding that NOSENKO did not
care for his RU assignment, invited him to consider joining
the KGB.

?

NOSENKO's Information-1964

Prior to NOSENKO's graduation he had been tentatively
assigned by the Institute's military commission to the RU,
and on the instructions of the Institute's "secret unit", he
was interviewed by a’ RU Colonel -KALOSHIN at the RU Personnel
Department. After passing the state examination on the
Second try, NOSENKO entered the Navy in. September 1950, when
he received orders calling him to active duty as a junior
jieutenant. He also received orders assigning him to the
Intelligence Staff of the Seventh (Far East) Fleet. He
left Moscow approximately 1.October 1950, travelling for
ten days by train to his unit, which was stationed near
Sovetskaya Gavan'. He was there assigned to a Reports
Section with duties which included translating American
naval publications and making summaries of Order of Battle
information of American naval forces in the Far East. A
radio signals intercept unit was connected with NOSENKO's
unit, but [contrary to what he asserted in 1962 and 1965] he
was not personally concerned with that unit's activities.

In spring 1951’ NOSENKO was promoted to. the rank of
lieutenant. At the ‘end of 1951 NOSENKO was assigned as. an
“apprentice”. in the Agent-Intelligence Section near
Sovetskaya Gavan", an assignment which involved subchaser
delivery and pickup:of agents from Hokkaido and Sakhalin.’

In early, 1952 NOSENKO filed by mail for divorce from
TELEGINA in a Moscow court. In April 1952 he returned to
Moscow on leave, where he visited the Naval RU Headquarters
personnel officer, Col. KALOSHIN,. and. requested a transfer
from the Far East. .During May and June 1952 he-was on
leave accrued. during His two years' service in the Far
East. Following his. leave, in summer 1952, NOSENKO was”

:, ordered. to proceed.to Rostock but he refused. and took
unauthorized leave. (He could not learn what his. actual
‘assignment was to be in Rostock, and he heard that the Naval

in East Germany, before going to Baltiysk. In
retracting that claim, he explained that he
knew his CIA interrogators would not believe
that he had successfully refused the assignment
in Germany.

In August or September 1952 NOSENKO returned to Moscow
for 7 to 10 days to complete the divorce proceedings which
he had initiated in the Far East. This was not regarded
as leave, but official business. He afterwards returned
to Sovetsk, but he did not like his work there, and in late
1952. he requested leave to return to Moscow to seek a transfer.
When his unit: commander refused him leave, NOSENKO appealed
to. Admiral GOLOVKO in Baltiysk, and because of the elder
NOSENKO's influence, was able to return to Moscow for a month's
leave in January. 1953. At the end of January NOSENKO visited
the RU Personnel Officer, KALOSHIN, and stated his distaste
for his work. KALOSHIN told him to “look around", and
NOSENKO spent February 1953 “at the disposal of the Personnel
Department", not doing anything. Since he wasn't working,
he didn't receive his pay, and he lived with his parents.

Comment: Just before giving this account of his January
1953 leave, NOSENKO claimed that he spent
January and a. part of February at the Kubinka
Sanitorium. He has never reconciled these two
statements.

NOSENKO's Information-1965

Prior to his graduation-from the Institute, a military
commission tentatively assigned NOSENKO to the Navy, after
which he visited a special section at the Naval Ministry
to file special forms for a security check. Although nothing
was said at the time, NOSENKO believed then that he was slated

he reported to the Naval Ministry and was told to return

for reassignment at the end of his leave. NOSENKO was on
leave in May and June 1952, and he remained “at the disposal
of the Naval Ministry". [According to his 1962 and 1966
versions, he was hospitalized during this period.]

In the summer of 1952 NOSENKO was offered assignments to
the RU Military-Diplomatic Academy, to a special Naval
espionage school, and to a post in Germany, but he turned
them all down. He rejected the opportunity to attend the
academy, because he had had almost all of the courses
earlier at the Institute of International Relations.

"Sometime after his return to Moscow from Sovetskaya
Gavan'," NOSENKO completed the formalities to secure his
divorce from TELEGINA. [According to his 1964 account,
NOSENKO visited Moscow later, from his Baltic assignment,
to complete divorce proceedings.]

In August 1952 NOSENKO received an assignment to Sovetsk,
in the Baltic, where he arrived in early September 1952.
His assignment there was as a political officer, in which
capacity he was involved with sailors being trained for
wartime sabotage missions. His main task was to prepare the
training plan for the agents, to instruct them in such
subjects as “The Foreign Policy of the USSR", and generally
to see to their needs. NOSENKO did not care for his
assignment in Sovetsk and in December 1952 he obtained leave
to spend the holidays-with his parents in Moscow.. In January
1953 NOSENKO and his parents visited KGB General KOBULOV
at the latter's dacha and KOBULOV, learning of NOSENKO's
dissatisfaction with the RU, suggested he consider working.
for. the. KGB.

After New Years in 1953 NOSENKO went “to rest for several
days" at the Hertzen "House of Rest", located 65-70 kilo-
meters from Moscow near Kubinka. There he met his second
wife, Lyudmila Yulianovna KOZHEVNIKOVA. {In 1964 and 1966
statements NOSENKO claimed he was not “resting" but was
hospitalized with tuberculosis for several weeks in January
and February.]

NOSENKO's Information-1966 (April)

At an interview with the military. placement commission
at the Institute before graduation, NOSENKO indicated that
he wanted to work in "some sort of a military organization".
Sopn thereafter the chief of the Institute's special. section
gave him a telephone number to cali. NOSENKO recognized the
number as one belonging to the MGB {the predecessor of, and
hereafter referred to,as; the KGB]. NOSENKO was invited to
an interview with KGB-officials who queried him about his
background and his knowledge of English. Later, however, -

“the chief of the Institute's special .section informed :
NOSENKO that his qualifications were unsuitable for assign-
ment: to the KGB. During the summer of 1950 “while state

At the end of April 1952 NOSENKO left Sovetskaya Gavan'
on leave, arriving in Moscow on 28 April. [Note earlier
versions in which he was transferred because of illness,
and that he was permitted to return to Moscow because of
his father's birthday.] While on leave he became ill with
tuberculosis antl spent almost two months in May and June.
1952 in a sanitorium near Moscow.

During the month of July 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to
the Naval Intelligence Point of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet
in Sovetsk, in Kaliningradskaya Oblast (at the head of the
Bay of Gdansk}. Sovetsk was a small village located on
the spit of land between Kaliningrad and Baltiysk. [The
only Sovetsk in Kaliningradskaya Oblast is located many
miles inland from Kaliningrad, in the opposite direction
from Baltiysk. When NOSENKO was shown their locations on
contemporary Soviet maps, he insisted that he was correct,
although Primorsk, where NOSENKO had said in 1962 that he
was assigned while in the Baltic, is located on a‘spit of
land between Kaliningrad and Baltiysk.] NOSENKO remained
in "Sovetsk". but a short time, and he returned to Moscow
at the end of 1952 to seek another assignment. Before
his departure he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant
of the Administrative Service. [In previous versions he
claimed to have become eligible for promotion and was
promoted while in the Far East, after less then a year's
service.]

On 1 January 1953 NOSENKO and his parents were guests at
the KOBULOV dacha. .NOSENKO indicated his dissatisfaction
with his RU assignment and KOBULOV promised to find him a
place in the KGB. :

In his most xecent account, in October "1966, “NOSENKO
‘Said. that before graduation from the Institute the military.
placement commission sent him to the’ KGB, but there he was
told that he was not qualified as a candidate because of -
mediocre-academic record and drinking habits. . NOSENKO said
he .did not mention this rejection earlier, because his
interrogators. would not have believed. that he ever became
a, KGB. officer after once being rejected. .

NOSENKO also volunteered that he had "Lliea”™ ‘when he
claimed* to have entered the Naval RU in 1950. In fact,.
‘he said,).he entered the.RU. in March 1951. and was. on active:
pose in’ the. Far East £xom 1951 until 1953.

Comment: This latest aésertion discredits almost all

the, RU, including ‘the date of ‘his graduation
“€rom the Instituté, the timing if not‘the
‘. fact. of his.promotion, the number,’ sequence,

active Naval service and assigned to the RU. With neither
training nor indoctrination he was assigned initially to
the Far East for nine months or three years; there he
participated in agents' operational training, or reports
work. In the‘latter capacity he was or was not involved
in RU radio signals intercept operations. He either never
served in the Baltic or, if he did, it was for three
months or six months, during which he either participated
in agent training or was an administrative or political
officer. He was promoted to lieutenant in the Far East
or in the Baltic, after either seven months' or thirteen
months' RU service.

Despite his claimed active commissioned service in the
Navy, NOSENKO knows nothing of Soviet Navy tradition,
doctrine, organization, or procedures. . He disétaims know-
ledge of RU organization other than at the posts where he
served, "because of his junior rank". However, even at
those posts he describes neither the staff, the functions
nor the personnel intelligibly nor does he describe the
posts’ actual locations.

The sole Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was

‘the personnel chief, Colonel KALOSHIN.. He identified.no

ranking officers in either the Baltic or Far East intelli-
gence staffs. Some thirty GRU officers he did identify,
by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not from his Naval RU
service, but through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow,
er through. his visits. to Geneva.

Conclusion.’

NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the
capacities at the places and times he claimed.

in the Naval RU and of his date of graduation from the
Institute of International Relations). To the extent to
which he has been consistent at all, he has cited March 1953
as the time of his entry to the KGB.

Date of Entry

NOSENKO at his: first meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962,
volunteered how and when he joined the KGB. NOSENKO had
just returned from his Naval RU assignment in the Baltic,
he said, when he met KGB General KOBULOV and KOBULOV urged
him to join the KGB. NOSENKO stated that after completing
his processing, he reported for duty in the Embassy Section
of the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in
March 1953, “just after Stalin died". (Stalin died on
5 March 1953.)

Comment: According to KGB defectors, the precise date
of entry to the KGB would not likely to be
forgotten by a KGB officer. The date is the
basis for computing length of service and is
a common entry. on KGB administrative forms
periodically filled out by KGB officers in the
course of. their service.

According to NOSENKO in January 1964, he transferred to
the KGB from the Naval RU "in something like 1952", "just

after Yu. I. GUK transferred from the Second Chief Directo-
rate".

Comment: GOLITSYN had reported that GUK was transferred
out. of the Second Chief Directorate in January
1952.

in February. 1964 NOSENKO wrote a biographic statement’ in
which he noted that. he entered the KGB. in 1952, and in’ which
he back-dated by one year his 1962 account.of. his activities
in the period 1945-1955.°° Although he was ‘then reminded..of i
his 1962 statement and the contradiction was discussed with
him, after study he indicated his approval by signing an
official biographic statement (for the Intelligence Community)
which indicated that he entered.on duty with the KGB in
about May 1952. : : 5

At the first. hostile interrogation in April. 1964,.NOSENKO
was confronted with his contradictory claims... In response,
NOSENKO ‘stated that he returned to Moscow fromthe Baltic. in
August 1952: [by most of his other accounts, NOSENKO returned
in January 1953] and entered the KGB on 5-7 September 1952,
By March 1953, NOSENKO stated, he had already worked in the
Embassy Section’ for some months against American correspor~
dents, and it was "just after Stalin's death, after the :
reorganization" that’ he assumed responsibility. for. operations
against American Army Attache personnel. [(NOSENKO ultimately
settled on June or July°1954 as the time of this reassignment.

Challenged in April 1964 to resolve thé contradictions of
his earlier claims that he joined the KGB variously in;
January 1952, September. 1952,’ or March'1953, NOSENKO
asserted that the truth was ‘that his service dated from. March:
1953, after Stalin's death.: He:went on to.explain that he
finished his Institute studies in 1949 (sic), "defended his
diploma" and-then failed-one ofthe four required State

-examinations.- All four examinations, he said, he had to :
take over-again, and as a result he didn't -receive his diploma

NOSENKO said that to ‘avqid admitting “this unpleasant thing", -
he claimed he joined the KGB in 1952:and after claiming. that’
to be a.fact, “did not want to correct it, to twist it around
again". _NOSENKO went on to say that the actual date of entry
was while Stalin was still alive, on "12 or 15 March 1953"

Comment: NOSENKO's explanation takes no account <=
‘fact that he had already said (in 1962)
he joined the KGB in March 1953.

KGB defectors describe the period i
following Stalin's death in the KGB as
extensivé reorganization and uncertaint
which new candidates were not being ac'
Other evidence of the improbability of
entering the KGB in March 1953 is disc
below.

NOSENKO repeated during 1965 interrogations the
13-15 March 1953. In 1966, however, in a written s
he said he entered the KGB on 2 April 1953, but a w
in another signed statement, he Said it was the "mi
March 1953".

In his final interrogation in October 1966 NOSENE.O
he entered the KGB in March 1953 and he acknowledgec
he had lied, and had known at the time he was lying,
he Had said he joined: in 1952. Asked by his interre
why he. had lied, NOSENKO said, “There was no sense.”
went on to explain that because he was only an averace
student and a heavy drinker, he had been found unsuite:
by the KGB- entry commission when he first applied in
he had tried to conceal this by adjusting his accou>
one year, since his interrogators would not have bez
that he was eventually accepted by the KGB after an e
rejection.

In all of his accounts NOSENKO has attributed tc Ge
KOBULOV's initiative and intervention his entry to =
Tn. the account which he volunteered in Geneva to Cc
1962, NOSENKO said KOBULOV was a friend of the eld
epi whom he met when the KGB General “dropped by" the

dacha outside of Moscow, and KOBULOV at the time (
1953") was First Deputy to Beriya, the Minister of

then-MVD. NOSENKO' said that when KOBULOV learned of NOSENKO's
dissatisfaction with the Naval RU, KOBULOV encouraged him

to enter. counterintelligence and invited him to visit the
‘GeneYal's office. : NOSENKO said he did not, but nevertheless
received a wéek later a telephone call from the KGB Personnel
Office asking him to appear at the secretariat, of General
KOBULOV and informing him that’ General KOBULOV. had already
arranged for a building’pass. :

NOSENKO gave a different, somewhat more detailed account
in April 1964. In this version, he first met KOBULOV, a
friend of the NOSENKO family, in February 1953. NOSENKO said
KOBULOV had visited. his.father in the latter's office, and
that evening ‘the elder NOSENKO brought him to the NOSENKO
dacha to spend the weekend. ..{NOSENKO had just before been
informed. by his interrogators that. KOBULOV was at that time
posted in Germany, not in’ Moscow.]. According to NOSENKO,,
KOBULOV was in’ Moscow on a short visit from Germany. /' "My
father invited.him to spend Saturday night and Sunday...On
Sunday’ we were playing-billiards and KOBULOV asked me.what
I. was doing, and I told him I was at the disposal of the
,: (Naval RU).Personnel Department ‘and: that’ I didn't want. to
*. return. to the Baltic." - NOSENKO.said that -KOBULOV. offered.
to call the KGB Personnel Office and have them "look *«
NOSENKO. over", and NOSENKO assented, after which he twice
visited the: Personnel Office where he filed completed forms.
NOSENKO asserted that.:KOBULOV. did not forget, because "just
as soon as STALIN died, KOBULOV immediately returned from
Germany" after being "summoned by Beriya or someone", and
.on “maybe the 10th of March" NOSENKO received a call from
KOBULOV'S assistant. NOSENKO: claimed he reported to’ KOBULOV's
office; and although he waited two hours to see the General,
the latter was busy elsewhere... Instead. of seeing KOBULOV, -:
however, NOSENKO said he was finally taken to the office
of Second :Chief Directorate Deputy Chief SHUBNYAKOV,.who
assigned him forthwith. to’ ‘the Embassy Section of the American
Department.: :

In April 1964 NOSENKO introduced a new variant. He said
that he met KOBULOV while accompanying his parents on a
visit in. January to KOBULOV's dacha [NOSENKO had previously
graphically described .KOBULOV'S weekend visit at the elder
NOSENKO's], KOBULOV intervened in his behalf, and he was
called to the KGB Personnel Office to be interviewed and.to

receive necessary forms. NOSENKO stated that he heard
nothing further until after Stalin's funeral, wnen he was
summoned to KOBULOV's office and afterwards assigned to
the Second Chief Directorate.

During the July 1965 interrogations NOSENKO retracted
his earlier claim that KOBULOV and his father had been close
persoial friends. He stated that his father's relationship
with KOBULOV was not personal, and that KOBULOV had never
visited the NOSENKOs.

In a biographic: statement written in April 1966, NOSENKO
said that he had met KOBULOV but twice, once on 1 January
1953 at the latter's dacha, and the second and last time in
the elder NOSENKO's office as NOSENKO's father and KOBULOV
were departing to attend Stalin's funeral. On that latter
occasion, NOSENKO claimed, KOBULOV promised to concern him-
self witn NOSENKO's entry into the KGB and it was several
days later that NOSENKO was summoned to KOBULOV's office
and told ne was appointed to the KGB.

Comment: General. Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV was a career
security official, but from the immediate post-
war period until after Stalin's death he was
not assigned to KGB Headquarters. As of 1952,
he was posted to Germany with the Chief
Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad, then

~ directly subordinate not to the MVD but to the
Council of Ministers and latterly to the
Ministry of Foreign Trade. Until he returned
from Germany in March 1953 to assume the
position of Beriya's deputy, he had no office
in KGB Headquarters. KOBULOV was arrested

with Beriya in June 1953, and also later executed.

In light of the foregoing, it is improbable
that KOBULOV was instrumental in NOSENKO's
appointment to the KGB at the times NOSENKO
claimed. If KOBULOV ever interceded in
NOSENKO's behalf, it is probable that NOSENKO
would later have been purged after KOBULOV's

NOSENKO states that in March 1953 he was already twenty-—
five and a half years old, a member of only the Komsomol,
and that he had not been recommended for Party membership.
He further claimed that.on entry to the KGB he became
secretary of the Second Chief Directorate Komsomol organi-
zation. :

Comment: Eligibility for Party membership, if not
membership itself, is a requisite for KGB
appointment. By Komsomol statutes,of that time,
twenty-five was at that time the maximum age.
Thus, at the time of NOSENKO's claimed KGB
appointment, he was within six months of being
dropped by the Komsomol as well as still
‘unqualified for Party membership. He could
not have been. secretary of the Second Chief
Directorate Komsomol organization, as discussed
on p. 338.

tuberculosis for which he was ‘periodically hospitalized.

Comment: According to KGB defectors familiar with the
standards in-force at the time, no candidate
was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis.

KGB ..Processing for Entry

NOSENKO has stated (in chronological order) that at his
initial interview with a KGB personnel, it was not necessary
for him to complete any forms or questionnaires since the
KGB~had his Naval RU file; that he was told that the KGB
would request the Naval RU file and meanwhile he was given
three copies of a four to six-page biographic form to complete
at home; and (at his last interrogation in 1966) that he

Comment: All promotions in the KGB were frozen from the

promotions has never been established. He has
also claimed this promotion occurred in 1952.

NOSENKO acknowledged that his qualifications for continued
KGB service were probably reviewed in connection with the

ground would have come to light. He stated, however, that
he could only.assume that the important and influential

KGB Entry: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's assertiohs regarding the KGB in the 1953-1954
period throw no more light on the actual date of his KGB

. entry than did his claims of when he transferred from the
meatal Naval RU; the contradictions and inconsistencies are
E interrelated.

It is possible that a former KGB officer, relating the
truth as he recalls it about events occurring ten years
earlier, could be inconsistent; that he could forget his
date of entry, not remember what administrative procedures
were, fail to recall the circumstances of the organization

_he joined were, be inaccurate about what his. pay was, and
be vague on what his KGB identification document looked
like. Recognizing that administrative regulations and
procedures are on occasion honored in the breach, it is 7
also possible that NOSENKO was accepted by the KGB despite
the fact that he was the son of a senior official, that he
had tuberculosis, that he was unqualified for Party member-
ae ship, that he had been previously rejected and all at a
time when the KGB was not accepting new récruits.

The probability of these events being coincident, however,
is remote. On examination, NOSENKO's latest admission, that
he "actually" entered the KGB in March 1953, is no better
substantiated: than.¢arlier accounts: citing other dates.

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner nor at the
time he claimed.

Although able to identify correspondents in Moscow who were
then recruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information
either in conversations with his superior {V.A.] KOZLOV or

at some point and in some undefined way after he no longer

was working against these targets. NOSENKO made clear that

he was not the case officer responsible for the more important
correspondents: “KOZLOV himself was working with_them, the
chief of the section himself--with GHAPTROVSwi th [SHAPIRO] s ob
wife. I also know that KOZLOV was Working with (WHITNEY) 94

and with (Andrew J.) STEIGER. )% For each of these persons
there was an operational fife which I did not see." According
to NOSENKO, he was, in no way involved with [STEIGER andO4

Operations Against u. S. Army Attache Personnel

NOSENKO claimed specific responsibility for work against
American Army Attaches during twenty months ‘of 1954-55, a
period in which NOSENKO claimed no supervisory responsibility

_to divert his attention from personal operational duties.

(NOSENKO,. explaining why he did not know more details about

-the Embassy Section's targets while ‘he was its deputy chief

in 1960-1961, said that as a supervisor he was too busy
overseeing subordinates. _Hence,.NOSENKO continued, .he could
not: be. expected: to. remember as many such details as would

be possible had he been a.case officer working.daily on only

“four or five targets... Elsewhere; he contrasted. operations

against tourists, wio often came and went in a matter of a
few days, with the work against the ‘service attaches and
diplomats permanently stationed. in Moscow, who could ‘be:

: studied systematically and slowly. )

NOSENKO ‘has:.said in different contexts ‘that as the

: American Depantment. case officer responsible for operations
- against: Army Attaches he’ received ‘and was responsible for

assimilating the. product ‘of a wide. variety. of sources ‘on. the

“ individuals who were. his targets... He has. mentioned infor-

mation received .from the..KGB First, Chief (Foreign Intelli-
gence) Directorate; the Archives of the MGB/MVD/KGB;. and

- the microphones which weré emplaced, about a year” before

NOSENKO entered the American Department.

Comment: ‘NOSENKO: has: said: variously that the microphones

Information was also received according to NOSENKO from the
network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors,
and other agents in the Embassy; permanent and roving
surveillance patrols outside the Embassy; fixed observation
posts next to, across from and near the Embassy; advance
notification of intent to travel by the attaches and their
itineraries; and reports from outside Moscow, including
surveillance, agent networks, the Militia, and the military.
The point of collecting and assimilating this information,
NOSENKO said, was to be able to know what the military
attaches were doing in Moscow and thereby to control their
intelligence collection activities. Far less important was
the goal of recruiting military attaches; NOSENKO knew of
only a few instances when this was attempted, and all of
these efforts allegedly failed.

Ne : The KGB's principal interest in control rather than
recruitment has been NOSENKO's explanation for knowing .little
about the backgrounds and personal lives of his targets--such
information, he stated, simply was not pertinent to the
primary mission of control. He has also used this explana-
tion to support his assertion that.there were no recruitments
ae . of American military personnel during this period.

Comment: NOSENKO's agsertion that the KGB's mission was
to control rather than to recruit American
military attaches is contradicted by the
emphasis KGB tradition and doctrine place on
conducting operations against the United
‘States, the-"main enemy", in the KGB” parlance,
in this case American officials with access to
classified information, who were residing in
the’ Soviet Union. aaiine

In the USSR, especially in the early 1950's
prior to the U-2 reconnaissance, the Service
Attache travel program was the primary means
by which the U.S. Armed Forces acquired intelli-
gence information on the Soviet Union's
military~industrial complex. The prevention
or inhibition of this collection activity fell
consequently to KGB components concerned with
the security of military-industrial installations,

-10. April 1964: “I made a mistake [when] I said I
accepted the cases from KHRENOV.... I accepted the cases
from Pavel Fedorovich PANKRATOV. This was in the beginning
of 1954." .

-15 April 1964: NOSENKO said that he thought he turned
over the correspondent files to F.V. KISLITSYN (who returned
to the USSR from Australia in May 1954). NOSENKO asked
when the PETROVs defected in Australia; he explained that
he was not sure about KISLITSYN and could have given them
to another officer. “If KISLITSYN came [back from Australia]
in 1953, then it was to KISLITSYN. Otherwise, it was some-
one else."

~18.June 1964: "KISLITSYN-came into the. Embassy Section
in 1954 and‘I gave him the files on American correspondents.
BUDYLDIN also joined the section this year and took the
files on the Army Attache and. his assistants from PANKRATOV.

I gave him the files'on the Army Attache and his assistants."

NOSENKO has. also*been indefinite as ‘to. the date. he assumed
responsibilities for the Attaches. As noted above, he said
on 10 April 1964 that he received the files in the beginning
of 1954.°- Ile had earlier said that he. worked on the corres=
pondents “only. about six months". If the date of March. 1953,
which-he most often gave for his entry into the KGB, is
correct, this would place the turnover in the fall of 1953.
On other.occasionshe has said specifically that he turned

“over the correspondent cases and began work against the E
Attaches in January 1954, on- still others that this occurred
in May 1954. In February 1965, NOSENKO said that he could
not remember when he changed assignments.

Agents. Reporting on Army Attaches

‘Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network
(agentura) at his disposal in operations against Army
Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NOSENKO
replied: "There were two maids, a cook, drivers...about ten
persons, plus the agent 'SERVIZNIY' and the one with the
cryptonym 'DMITRIYEV'.... These additional two agents,
about 12 or 13 agents altogether." ‘With one exception, this

network remained constant until NOSENKO transferred from

the’ American Embassy Section in mid-1955.. He met each agent
about ‘once a week, except. for the. chauffeurs who were met
three ‘times a month in a safehouse or on the street. The

Of the KGB agents among the chauffeurs, NOSENKO named
Nikolay SHNYRYEV, who was used by various attaches. “He
reported where they went, what they said, whether they took
notes or photographs, whether they had unusual packages
with them, and so on."

"When viewing photographs (see below) in September 1964,
NOSENKO identified Vladislav VOROBYEV as his former agent
"SERVIZNI¥". He had been working in the Embassy since its
establishment, starting first as a messenger boy and, in
NOSENKO's time, performing clerical tasks. VOROBYEV had no
direct connection with the Army Attaches, and NOSENKO said
he himself did not know why ne had been given VOROBYFV to
handle in 1954. The main function of this agent was
‘delivering to NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephone
listings of the Embassy, issued monthly.

"DMITRIYEV's" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV;
NOSENKO' saw this name on a 1962 phone list and thought, but
was not sure, that this was his agent. An electrician who
worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems and
elevator, "DMITRIYEV". reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires
and other wires he had observed on the top floors. Like
VOROBYEV, "“DMITRIYEY" had no direct connection with the
Army Attaches. : a : :

Comment:.. Elsewhere NOSENKO described an electrician who
provided ‘some technical information on the
Embassy, but he related him to his second tour
in the American Embassy Section in 1960-1962
and didnot then claim that the electrician. was
his agent. : : :

In September 1964 NOSENKO was’ shown a series of 260
biographic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American
Embassy in Moscow. Each card contained a photograph of the
person involved and short biographic notes, including his
name and job in the Embassy. The first time he went through
these cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only the photo—
graphs; NOSENKO did not identify the photographs of SHNYRYEV

adding that he thought his name was VOROBYEV.. “hen shown
the Embassy biographic cards on SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV, he
identified each of them as his agents during the 1954-1955
period in the American Department and equated them to the
cryptonyms given previously. .In the case of SHNYRYEV, when
shown the biogtaphic information, which listed SHNYRYEV as

were known to be using during their travels inside the
Soviet Union. As early as the beginning of 1954, the
American Department had been given authorization from the
Central Committeeé.of the Communist Party to steal this
equipment from the Americans, provided that the success of
such an operation was assured. Refore his transfer to the

abortive attempt to seize the equipment from an Attache at

Additional Reporting

Knowledge of another KGB operation involving Americans
was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in
the American Embassy Section, against CIA officer and
Embassy Security Officer Edward Ellis SMITH (see p. 37).
NOSENKO claimed to have personally participated in the
operations against E.E. SMITH in 1954-1955. The incidents
which NOSENKO described, however, occurred in June 1956,
by which time NOSENKO, by his own account, had been out of
the American Embassy Section for a year and when he was
involved in the Seventh Department recruitment of [Richara (6
BURGI} His involvement in the [BURGI|case has been confirmed, ,

NOSENKO has also described the KGB recruitment of military
cipher machine mechanic “ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, see p. 33),
whose true name he claimed not to have known. He dated the
recruitment as occurring "in 1949-1950" and "before he
joined the KGB", although he said that he knew of the
existence of the agent during his first tour in the Embassy
Section in 1953-1955. However, NOSENKO also related that
“ANDREY" was recruited while Roy RHODES was in Moscow, that
RHODES “had spotted 'ANDREY'". "ANDREY" and RHODES over-
lapped in Moscow from April 1952 to July 1953. "ANDREY"
fixes his own recruitment. as occurring in December 1953,
and until his departure in April 1954 he was responsible
for the entire Embassy code room. In that capacity "ANDREY"
was a direct subordinate of the Army Attache eryptographic
security officer, NOSENKO's target [Army Captain Walter MULE} os
If NOSENKO served in the‘Embassy Section during 1953-1955
as he claimed, it is difficult to perceive how he could have
remained unaware of “ANDREY's" identity.

American Embassy Section - ca. 1953-June 1955:
Summary and Conclusion :

According to NOSENKO, immediately upon entering on duty
with the KGB he was assigned without training to what he
describes as the most sensitive and important section of
the Second Chief Directorate. There, after first handling
agents covering American correspondents resident in Moscow,

1S Ko tHE
Top Secret Copy __10_
SBR

99



Top Secret

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION ~ ca. 1953-June 1955)

he was made the case officer solely responsible for opera-
tions against the commissioned officers of the Embassy's
Army Attache office, until his transfer to the Seventh

Department. Alleging. complete knowledge of all service

attache operations, NOSENKO flatly asserts that there were

no KGB recruitments of American military personnel during

the period of his assignment to the Embassy Section.

Pertinent to the consideration of .NOSENKO's statements |
is his reluctance to discuss the 1953-1955 period, and his
inconsistent accounts of the dating and circumstances of

his entry into the Embassy Section, of his assumption of
responsibility as sole case officer for Army Attache tar- l
gets, and of his transfer to the Seventh Department. .Al-

though NOSENKO could plausibly claim failing memory to ex- |

plain some areas of ignorance, he does not do so. Instead,

he is positive and insistent that his statements about his

targets are a factual and complete account of what was then

known to the KGB. His assertion that the KGB was not in- |
terested in his targets' vulnerability to recruitment is

belied by his own statements as well as by the [MULE} case ,06

as he himself related it. He is uninformed about both At-

tache personnel and agent-informants who, by his own ac-

count, were his targets and his agents.

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section
throughout the March 1953-dJune 1955 period as he claimed.
Specifically, he neither entered the Section in March 1953
nor transferred from the Section in June 1955. In whatever
period he may have served, he was not the sole case officer
responsible for commissioned officers in the office of the
Army Attache. Unaware of many aspects of KGB activities
involving Army personnel and by his own account not involved
with either Air or Naval Attache personnel or diplomats,
NOSENKO has no valid claim to certainty that the KGB re-
cruited no American Embassy personnel during this period.

then a substantial number of similar missions
had also been launched by American m: tar
intelligence organizations and by the. |
and allied services.

It is a matter of fact, not of conjecture,
that as early as 1957 a large number of these
agents were coming to the attention of the KGB
within the Soviet Union. Few were arrested.
Instead, all were surveilled, and some pro-

against American and British tourists in 1955-
1960.

NOSENKO claimed he served with the Seventh Department
from June 1955 until January 1960. According to him, the
Seventh Department exercised counterintelligence functions
involving foreigners then visiting the Soviet Union,
including businessmen, seamen, foreign delegations and some
ists, as well as the hotels and restaurants utilized by
visitors. He said that by 1958, however, the number
reign tourists visiting the Soviet Union had grown
appreciably, and in June 1958 the Seventh Department

NOSENKO explained that one of the new sections became

NOSENKO's Soviet Agents

The Seventh Department Tourist Section, just established
when NOSENKO was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent
network for operations against American and British tourists.
Consequently, HOSENKO said, he and the other case officers
had to "start from the beginning".

As a first step NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow
officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist. These
were not agents, he explained, but "just persons a KGB man
could approach with questions about somebody or something".
NOSENKO collected information on these and others with the
aim of formalizing their recruitments. By the end of 1955,
he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all
of them Inturist interpreters. During the following four
years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied.
Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another,
some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing
all the time, back and forth". In 1956, NOSENKO said, he
had about ten agents, in 1957 there were about twelve, in
1958 about eight, and at the end of 1959 (when he was
preparing to return to the American Department) he had
approximately twelve. The substance of NOSFNKO's descrip-
tion of his agents is as follows:

Larissa SOBOROVA

An Inturist English-language interpreter, SOBOROVA was
one of the first agents recruited in 1955 by NOSENKO within
Inturist. She reported to himon all foreigners with whom
she worked as an interpreter. She worked with NOSENKO when
he served. as a guide for British subjects [BIRSB) and| LANE in OL
the summer of 1957. During 1957-1959 she was involved and
possibly sexually intimate with American(travel writer Of, 06
Horace SUTTON) SOBOROVA was NOSENKO's agént until 1959, /
when she mar¥ied and “retired".

_ between 1957 and 1959. {SUTTON}has identified 04
a her. In 1959 she was the head of all English-
fe language interpreters at Inturist headquarters
in‘the National Hotel, Moscow.

Vladimir MUROMTSEV

MUROMTSEV, KGB cryptonym "LEBEDEV", was recruited by
HOSENKO from Inturist in.1955.. He was NOSENKO's agent!
until called into the army in about.1959, when he was sent
to-a Soviet. Air Force Academy in Central. Asia to serve as
an interpreter with Syrian students there.: During that
period his file was held by tlie KGB organization in Central
Asia. ‘When he returned to Moscow he was re-employed by the
KGB Second Directorate. _ ct : ptt

Comment: | NOSENKO has said elsewhere that MUROMTSEV ‘had

: : been a’ Second Chief Directorate agent "since
1958"; implying that someone else recruited
him and. that he thus could not have been
“NOSENKO's agent in 1955. MUROMTSEV was
_identified.in 1957 as.an Inturist guide by
two CIA sources. E

-;ROGOV, KGB cryptonym “OZERO", was. recruited in°1955.. He
fiad been formerly a “confidential contact" of the KGB. He

worked in the central Inturist office which assigned inter-
preters to British and American citizens visiting the USSR.

Nataliya SHULGINA

SHULGINA was an Inturist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO
in 1955. NOSENKO knew that double agent Boris BELITSKIY
[see p.282] “reported to the KGB that CIA had warned BELITSKIY
against SHULGINA".

Comment: KGB-controlled CIA. source BELITSKIY reported
to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB agent: CIA did
not warn him. SHULGINA was for two years the
secretary-interpreter of NBC correspondent
Irving R. LEVINE after his arrival in Moscow
in July 1955. She served as a guide for an
American musical troupe's visit in the USSR
in 1956 and in 1956 and 1957 she served as a
guide for American tourists in Moscow. According
to BELITSKIY, she.was involved in the sexual 7
entrapment and KGB recruitment of [British MP Ob
Tom DRIBERG NOSENKO's apparent ignorance of
SHULGINA's “involvement with LEVINE and other
Americans, as well as with [DRIBERG, and of her
foreign travel, belies his claim that she was
his agent during the 1955-1958 period. Shown
her photograph in 1964, NOSENKO failed to
recognize it. ‘hen he was then given her name,
he identified her not as his former agent but
just as a Second Chief Directorate agent once
involved with BELITSKIY.

NOSENKO, he was meeting with another KGB case officer.
DMITRIYEV accompanied a sports delegation to Norway and a
Soviet circus to Japan.

Comment: DMITRIYEV's travel to Norway and Japan in
1958 is confirmed. From NOSENKO's own
statement he was aware of DMITRIYEV's
activities, but he was not his case officer.

(Fnu) IVANOV

Once a recruited agent in the Baltic area, when IVANOV
moved to Moscow the provincial KGB suggested he might be
of some use in the capital. IVANOV was a lawyer employed
by the Institute of Foreign Trade when NOSENKO became his

Commonwealth Department which “planted him in the British

Military Institute of Foreign Languages, where she studied
military subjects as well as foreign languages. When
NOSENKO became her case officer she was working as an

Soviet Homosexual A ents
= asexual Agents

The KGB operations which NOSENKO described commonly

' involved sexual entrapment, Many of the operations in
which he claimed a personal role involved the use of homo-
Sexual agents, KGB agents whose homosexuality was exploited
against susceptible male targets. ‘vhile NOSENKO was never
their official case officer, in specific recruitment-
entrapment operations he worked with "LUCH", "NIKOLAYEV",
"SIBEYAK", “KOSHIKIN" and "STROYEV" (Victor BELANOVSKIY, b,
used in the compromise of [Richard BURGY, VASSALL, and the
Canadian Ambassador WATKINS). He provided virtually no
personality information on them and usually could not recall
their true names, Two such homosexuals, however, VOLKOV
and YEFREMOV, NOSENKO claimed were his own agents.

NOSENKO claimed to have re-recruited VOLKOV, a former
agent (cryptonym "SHMELEV") and recruited YEFREMOV
(cryptonym "GRIGORIY") and to have been their sole case
officer from the beginning of their KGB careers in 1957-
1958 until they were discharged in 1963 because they had
become too well known. He said he met them frequently,

ee] and directed them in at least a dozen entrapment operations
or other homosexual encounters, NOSENKO claimed he took
them with him when he transferred to the American Department
in 1960 and back again in early 1962 to the Seventh
Department.

YEFREMOV and VOEKOV.

Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a

aed public toilet in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded
that A.I. VOLKOV’ might be a homosexual and hence of some
Operational value. “To verify this possibility in 1957, a
homosexual agent of the Moscow Criminal Investigations
Department provoked VOLKOV into a compromising situation.
Then VOLKOV, who had previously been a KGB agent but was
at this time inactive, was summoned by the KGB and, after
NOSENKO interrogated him, he admitted his homosexuality and
agreed to NOSENKO's proposal to work for the KGB among

homosexuals. VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to
recruit a homosexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronymic not
recalled) YEFREMOV. The two agents subsequently worked

as a team against foreigners under NOSENKO's direction; in
addition to specific targets, they had the general assign-
ment of associating with foreign visitors in Moscow for the
purpose of spotting possible homosexuals. NOSENKO described
on 12 June 1962 his use of these agents:

“Although I am a chief of section there I
have all sorts of agents. I have a good agent
apparatus. I have beautiful girls, whom I can
use as I like. I have homosexuals, in particu-
lar, one special pair. JI am afraid they are
known to both you and the British... I permitted
this pair to work [without specific assignments]
on their own. I give them money and tell them
to go look around, but only Americans. Look for
American pederasts. They call me at night:
‘Yuriy Ivanovich. There is a mister so-and-so
here.' I say: ‘Well, let him [do what he
wants]. We'll talk about it tomorrow.' So the
next day they go’ to a special hotel room. We
make photographs. Then we think about what he
represents. Is he worth it? Then, as Chief, I
recommend that he be recruited or not--depending:‘
on his position, what he can give, what he can
tell. If he can give something, I say: ‘Well,
let's have a go [igrat].' After this, I speak
to these boys: ‘Well, go with him again. Do
whatever is wanted.' All-‘this is observed by
the KGB. The [hotel] administrator enters.
‘What are you doing?' The administrator calls
the Militia. An akt is drawn up. ‘Well, you
are a foreigner. “This is not our business. We
don't know what to do.with you.' Then the Chief
arrives and a conversation ensues: ‘Listen,
what shall we do? Pederasty is punishable by
three to five years and now, on the basis of
recent legislation, by up to eight. Understand,
if your friends find out that you are a pederast--
and how can they help but find out'..."

When NOSENKO moved from the Seventh Department to
the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in
January 1960, he took VOLKOV and YEFREMOV with him. They
were never used against targets in the American Embassy
but, NOSENKO said, the Seventh Department “used to call
me on homosexual prospects", VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued
as active KGB agents until some time in 1960_or 1961.
After they were employed once more [against|".E. JOHNSON| in OG
January 1962]. it was decided that they were oo well
Known", NOSENKO claimed that the agents were retired and
that he himself sent their files to KGB Archives in 1962
or 1963.

NOSENKO's Soviet Agents: Summary

NOSENKO claims to have been these agents' case officer
for two to five years, during which he met each regularly,
assigned them operational tasks, and received their reports.
With the exception of YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, however, NOSENKO
can cite few instances of their operational use, and he has
but superficial knowledge of their personal backgrounds.

It is unlikely that this is merely the result of failing
recollection. He knows no more about the three whom he

claimed he took with him to the Embassy Section, where he

continued to be their case officer for two more years, than

he does about the others. In the two instances where his |
agents were involved in KGB operational activity, NOSENKO ,,

is unaware of SHULGINA's work with LEVINE and\DRIBERG, andb

> was not involved when KUNGAROVA was targetted against and

ibs Corer CIA agent Philip NIELSEN. NOSENKO's familiarity |
ith the nine agents he named appears to be that which

would be acquired secnand-hand, not through personal contact.

as he claimed.

With respect to YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, the evidence does
not sustain NOSENKO's claim that he was their case officer
in every operation from their recruitment in 1957 until
their retirement in 1962-1963. He is unfamiliar with either
agent's background, He cannot say where either of them
lived or, indeed, how he got in touch with them when he
xequired their services. With the exception of hel #2. OF

efficers “for..this. purpose) telephoned K.N. DUBAS, Chief. of

would probably question [SIRSE jespecially, as one 06
who used to work in intelligence... [BIRSE) would O6
say: ‘There was this man from the Ministry of

why it was decided I have to go again under the

pate in contests in London. He left on 27
August 1957. With the same name and date of
birth, NIKOLAYEV arrived again at London on
12 October 1958 with seventeen others, all
described as boxers. His visa application
described him as an “office worker", but.on
his landing card, NIKOLAYEV was listed as a
boxer. He left London on 19 October 1958.

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO personally and alone recruited the Moscow
representative of [British European Airways}, whose nameC 4
NOSENKO did not recall, at the Hotel Metrépol in Moscow
during the summer of 1959, possibly in August. The approach
was based on homosexual compromise involving NOSENKO's
agents VOLKOV and YEFREMOV.

NOSENKO explained that the Seventh Department in 1959
had a section dealing with commercial representatives, which
was responsible for the{BEA|man. That section had asked
NOSENKO's section for help. 29

“They said they didn't have any agents or any-
thing and didn't know what to do. So somebody said,
‘Well look, why don't you ask the chief of the
section? He's a specialist on homosexuals and can
arrange everything for you.' So I wound up handling
the case, and TARABRIN (of the First Chief Direct-
orate) said I should report to him."

(In this passage NOSENKO was referring to himself, although
he has always claimed he was Deputy chief of the section.]

Moscow, but he was here two and a half or three
years. We hope that he will return. We are waiting

language very well. He is, in fact, an emigre, this

‘recruited? I was interested in knowing precisély
by whom, by name, and how approaches were being made
to our delegations [in the United States]. I was
interested in him from the point of view of counter-
intelligence, not intelligence. What kinds of
approaches are taking place to our people in America
and by whom? This is what interested me. But he
didn't know anything. He provided only superficial
information, nothing more."

NOSENKO was then asked whether {FRIPPEL] would not have been
useful for coverage, of AmericanS visiting the Soviet Union.
He replied no, that thé KGB had already had great success in
this by other means.

In Geneva in 1964 and during subsequent debriefings. and
interrogations, NOSENKO’ made additional statements concerning
the [FRIPPEL\ case.

NOSENKO attributed his involvement in the[ FRIPPEL]

recruitment as follows:

"In 1958, after 1958, when I became the Deputy
Chief of the section, my area of activity was
narrowed down. I didn't handle all the tourists at
that time. I worked as the Deputy Chief of the
section and I had. my own little area--for example, i
the permanent representative of thefAmerican Express 09
veer | and besides that I began to-collect all the
materi on all American tourist firms which have
anything to do with Inturist and which send tourists

in the Soviet Union as a guide for some American journalists.
(NOSENKO was unable to give the composition of the journa-
list group or to recall where they stayed in Moscow and
where else they travelled in the Soviet Union.) NOSENKO
contacted him in Moscow. to. learn what questions the newsmen
intended to ask Khrushchev during a scheduled interview;
[subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged that standard practice
required visiting journalists’ to submit their intended
questions for Khrushchev in writing to Soviet authorities
prior to interviews]. After the interview, he recontacted
ERIPPEL\to learn the reaction of the journalists to their

alk with the Soviet leader. NOSENKO could not recall their
specific reaction to the Khrushchev interview but did
remember that they were "satisfied". Another reason for
Obcontacting FRIPPEL NOSENKO added in a later discussion,

was to learn whether any. of the journalists might have

Operational Activities - 1955-1960: Summary

According to NOSENKO, after an uneventful assignment in
the. American Department's Embassy Section, in 1955 he was
transferred to the newly-organized Seventh Department
Tourist Section as a case officer. Between 1955 and 1957
he assembled. a network of agents and. was involved in four
KGB attempts to recruit_foreign tourists. One of these
attempts, that against )/Richard BURG], was the first recruit-06
ment of the Tourist Section; it won NOSENKO.a commendation,
brought him to the attention of General GRIBANOV, and turned
NOSENKO into an effective and successful KGB officer. In
1958 NOSENKO was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section. He then
recruited the second member of his two-man homosexual team
and, in 1958 and 1959, participated in ten KGB attempts to
recruit American and British visitors to the USSR and one
American resident of Moscow. NOSENKO's success in the
Seventh Department prompted GRIBANOV to transfer him back

Q the American Embassy Section as Deputy Chief with the
ayia priority task of reviving KGB operations against
rican Embassy code clerks. -

It is worthy of note that of the fifteen cases in which
he personally participated, by his own admission, NOSENKO
became involved in nine not because they were operations of
his section, but because the targets were the victims of
homosexual or other entrapment. In addition, three of the
fifteen operations were not directed by his section, but
by senior Seventh Department officers. According to his
own statements, four others were specifically the responsi-
bility of other Seventh Departmént sections of KGB elements,
including the Foreign Seamen Section (GEHRCKENS), Delega~ (%

Of Dotions Section [LAN angtDIRSD) , Commercial Representatives

Seventh Department operation: by NOSENKO's other statements,
she was not a "tourist" and she would have been the target -
of. the Moscow Oblast KGB because of her intention to snes

a Soviet citizen.

«| While NOSENKO's participation -in. the attempted recruit-
ment of the targets he describes, even where not confirmed,
is not disputed,’ the evidence suggest that he was an
English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a
counterintelligence officer responsible for the identifi-
cation of foreign agents among tourists or for the develop-
omenty recruitment, and exploitation. of. cagents for the KGB.”

‘Nothing NOSENKO has said indicates that..there was any

Comment: NOSENKO has never resolved why these cases,
which predated the records he claimed he
reviewed, were included in his notes. More

+ important, he never could explain why he was
unfamiliar with American tourist cases which
occurred at a time when he claimed that he

of all such cases.

KGB Counterintelligence Operations
Among Foreign Tourists, 1955-1960 |

Besides those operations in which NOSENKO claimed personal
involvement or about which he learned in his capacity of
Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section,
NOSENKO claimed awareness of what the KGB knew of the use
of tourists in the USSR. by foreign intelligence services

“throughout the 1955-1960 period. Information from other
sources. serves as'a basis for judging the validity of
NOSENKO's claim.

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO's Tourist Study

Sometime between May and October 1959, during the
5 tourist season, NOSENKO was ordered. to gather facts for
i Second Chief Directorate Chief GRIBANOV concerning the use
of tourist cover by foreign intelligence services during
the. period 1955 through 1958. NOSENKO said he assembled
this material from the Seventh Department's annual reports
of the years 1955-1958, supplemented by information he
obtained from discussions with knowledgeable Seventh
. Department case officers. NOSENKO recalled only that the
study incorporated statistical data on the growth of
i foreign tourism; he did not remember the content of the
i : study, any examples included in it, or what the study
q concluded about American or British Intelligence tourist

“bilities inthe Seventh Department, NOSENKO' asserted that. ~
he:cotild. accurately. describe KGB, counterintelligence
operations among tourists during the period 1955-1960.

“Extent of KGB Knowledge

According ‘to NOSENKO,° operations against foreign tourists
were developing slowly during this period and very little
was known by the’ KGB about the American Intelligence use
of. tourism atthe time:he wrote the study: in 1959. : No
agents were definitely identified among American tourists,
and no tourists were "caught in the act" mailing letters,

eloped suspicions concerning a. number, of tourists

they were disseminating foreign literature... The KGB never.
established ‘any firm intelligence connection, -however,
despite various’ operational measurés ‘taken such as. v emka
* (Covert. baggagé Search) Vand maneuvering KGB agents: in

were definitely identified as American Intelligence agents,
NOSENKO concluded. On. related matters, NOSENKO asserted
that during. his 1955-1960 service-in the Seventh Department
».the KGB acquired no information. regarding ‘American. Intelli-
gence use of tourism; specifically, the KGB obtained no
documentary information on this topic from any agent source;

former CIA staff employee. He visited the
Soviet Union as a tourist in April-May 1959,
during which period he was the target of
numerous KGB provocations, including black-
market, females, and a Soviet citizens' request
for assistance in defecting to the Americans.

- Also, a customs officer confiscated from

Information Furnished the KGB by George BLAKE

In 1959 the KGB obtained from its agent in MI-6,

[George BLAKE, who was arrested by British authorities in
April 1961] the complete details of the CIA-MI-6 program for
utilizing tourist agents in the Soviet Union. In early
June 1959 a three-day conference was held in London between
CIA and MI-6 representatives, at the conclusion of which a
nineteen-page document was drawn up which described opera-
tional doctrine on tourist operations, including agent
spotting, agent selection, agent assessment, agent training,
and agent tasks planned for the current (1959) tourist
season. The document stressed CIA planned use of tourists

KGB operations. Other than to allege that certain KGB
officers he named were ‘his subordinates, he provided no
information to substantiate his claim that he had any
supervisory or. administrative responsibilities. The common.
feature of the operations do not relate to NOSENKO's own
description of the function of the Seventh Department's
Tourist Section or later, to the American-British Common-
wealth Section. Most were sexual or other entrapment
operations, .and he acknowledges that several were operations
conducted by KGB elements other than his own section, In
short, NOSENKO need not have been in the Seventh Department
sections, as he claims, to have learned of or participated
in the activities he describes. Although NOSENKO gives a
graphic account of the Second Chief -Directorate's (and his i...
own) counterintelligence mission, his knowledge is not of :
counterintelligence operations among tourists; in the only
three such operatiions he describes, the counterintelligence
aspects were incidental. Contrary to his claims, NOSENKO
is aware neither of all important KGB operations conducted
against American tourists during the period, nor what was
known to the KGB about American Intelligence and British
tourist operations.

CHAPTER VII

AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION OF AMERICAN DEPARTMENT

_ Deputy Chief of the Section

“ NOSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the’

“American Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB

» Second Chief Directorate, from sometime in. January. 1960.
‘until the first days of January: 1962. This. section, in
-“his words; was working against "the most-important counter-
“intelligence target in the Soviet Union", the. permanent

American representation. in Moscow. “It regarded every wad
Américan stationed’ there a possible SPY and, simultaneously,

The’ functions of the American Embassy. Section were’
described. by NOSENKO. as being to’ monitor’all contacts: by

“) Embassy personnel with Soviet citizens, to collect all

information possible on American Embassy employees; and

“to use this information as.a ‘basis for planning and imple=*

menting recruitments. |The Americans' personalities, jobs,
personal relationships, weaknesses, daily routines, security
precautions, contacts with Soviet citizens, and the major
and minor scandals in their Moscow lives formed the basis.’
for this work. .To gather such information, the section's

,officers employed large numbers of agents and informants

among the indigenous employeés of the Embassy, Soviet
citizens moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country
nationals ‘with American contacts. The officers also :
benefitted from the reports of numerous surveillance teams
at their disposal, as well as information obtained from
telephone taps and microphones. in Americans' offices and
homes. Each officer had a limited number ‘of. American
targets with whom he attempted to become thoroughly familiar.

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION ~ January 1960-January 1962)

exploiting the knowledge they had gained of their targets.

During 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO said, within the section |
special emphasis was placed on “identifying intelligence

officers in the Embassy and actively developing them,

acquiring ciphers, and painstakingly studying code clerks, Es
creating the basis on which they can be recruited". {.

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO said, he had
access to all information concerning its activities:
"Nothing was hidden" from him. On this basis, he expressed
certainty that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB recruited no
Americans associated with the Embassy, there were no KGB
agents among americans assigned to the Embassy in this
period and, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American
Embassy personnel since "“ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, recruited
ca. 1953, see p. 33). From continuing friendships with
his fellow-officers of 1960-and 1961, who remained in the
section when NOSENKO transferred, NOSENKO has also claimed
certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the
time he left the section in January 1962 until his January
1964 departure in Geneva.

Transfer to. the American Embassy Section

In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the
American Section of the Seventh Department, NOSENKO learned
from the Department Chief DUBAS of plans to transfer him
back to the American Department's American Embassy Section,
as Deputy Chief. NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move
and wanted to remain in the Seventh Department:

"J was used to it there and wanted to continue.
I wanted to stay in the Seventh Department. This
{the transfer] was no promotion. Here I was the
Deputy Chief of section and would be the same
there. The American Department is, of course, the
most important. But here I was working against
American tourists. This is also important.
Furthermore, I showed [had proven] myself there in
'55, '56, ‘57, '58, and '59 and was considered to
be not a bad case officer. And there, in the
American Department, I must prove myself with new
people."

(AMERICAN EMBABEY. SECTION - January 1960-January 1962)

NOSENKO therefore asked DUBAS to try to retain*him.. DUBAS
later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second Chief
Directorate’ Chief O. M. GRIBANOV on his behalf; but. to no*
avail. -In January 1960 the official orders transferring

NOSENKO' were issued, :.

On the:day NOSENKO reported to V.A. KLYPIN, Chief of
the American Department, to begin his new job, he was. told
to report to GRIBANOV's office... NOSENKO expressed his
misgivings about the change of .assignment.to GRIBANOV.
GRIBANOV replied that DUBAS had spoken, to him but that he,

“-GRIBANOV; "had -his own plans and that was all". .’GRIBANOV.”
“told ‘NOSENKO’ that he. thought NOSENKO could bring "fresh aix"
«to the American, Embassy Section's operations and that he
‘was to’pay particular attention to operations against

American code clerks, the "number one target".

Predecessor as Deputy Chief

Asked on 17 April.1964 whom he ‘had: reliéved upon reporting:
for duty in the American Embassy Section, NOSENKO replied:
"No one." Hé assumed responsibility for thé Embassy ‘security
file. from KOVSHUK.. Various casé officers éarlier had been

Colonel Mikhail BAKHVALOV,, the Deputy ‘Chief of the Fifth

wname not recalled, who was Deputy Chief of the Fifth

Department. In’June, in “listing KGB officers who had
xeceived various awards for their service, NOSENKO included

“the name of Mikhail BAKHVALOV,. Deputy Chief of "an unremem-

bered department".of the Second.Chief Directorate.

on 18 June 1964 NOSENKO was asked to list the names of
all officers who had either joined or departed the American
Embassy Section from the time NOSENKO was transferred to

the Seventh Department in 1955 to his return to the American
Embassy Section in 1960. NOSENKO listed fourteen officers
as having joined the section, and five who had been trans~
ferred out. In neither list did NOSENKO mention BAKHVALOV.

A week ‘later, however, on 24 June 1964 NOSENKO stated
that "in 1959 and possibly in 1958 Mikhail Fedorovich
BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of the American Embassy
section. 1 replaced him in his position in 1960 and he

went to the Fifth Department as Deputy Chief". In September
1964 NOSENKO asserted that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief, [not
the others he had identified earlier] had been LANGELLE's
case officer. In 1965 NOSENKO first mentioned that
BAKHVALOV, not KOVSHUK, had been responsible for maintaining
the Embassy security file and stated that BAKHVALOV had
shared with KOVSHUK responsibility for supervising code
clerk operations. : oe

Comment: Interrogation has never resolved contradictions
between NOSENKO'S earlier accounts of what
functions he assumed from. whom when he entered

the Section, and his belated assertions that
BAKHVALOV: was his predecessor as Deputy. Chief.

Hl Responsibilities

H Shortly after reporting. for duty in the American Embassy
| Section and following his short discussion with GRIBANOV,
NOSENKO said he met with American Department Chief KLYPIN
and Embassy Section Chief KOVSHUK to discuss his responsi-
pilities and functions in the section. Repeating what
GRIBANOV had said, KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's most
important single responsibility in the section would be
supervision of all KGB operational activity against American
military and State Department code clerks stationed in
Moscow. As for the other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN

responsibility of taking over in KOVSHUK's absence, he had
access to and was obliged to keep current on all information
relating to the section's activities. On this basis he

In the two years of NOSENKO's service in the section
there were a total of-over three months when he said KOVSHUK
was 111 or on leave, NOSENKO recalled that he was Acting
Chief during KOVSHUK's two 30-day leave periods in 1960 ana
1961, although he did not remember precisely in which months.
He also served as Acting Chief for about a month in the
summer of 1960 when KOVSHUK was in the KGB hospital with
heart trouble and for a week or two some time in 1961, again
when KOVSHUK was ill, He recalled that KOVSHUK was also
absent for several days in connection with preparations for
President Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in
1960.

As Acting Chief in KOVSHUK's absence, NOSENKO stated that
he was responsible for supervising the administrative work
and operational activity of the entire section and, in
particular, for assuming KOVSHUK's work in directing
operations against diplomatic personnel assigned to the
American Embassy.

NOSENKO could recall no operational decisions that he
made as acting chief, nor any specific or unusual occurrences
during these times. NOSENKO said that the only specific
responsibility of KOVSHUK's which he handled in the Chief's
absence was repotting to the Chief of the First Department
about all correspondence going out of the Embassy Section.
NOSENKO Stated he met none of KOVSHUK's agents during his
absences, nor could he remember any of them except GLAZUNOV
[whom NOSENKO said in April 1964 was his own agent and later
said was. "KOVSHUK's and FEDYANIN's"] and the American
correspondent STEVENS |[{about whom NOSENKO had reported in
connection with his activities in 1953-55].

According to NOSENKO, KOVSHUK had personal contact, under
Ministry of Foreign Affairs cover, with "some" American :
Embassy officers, but the only such Embassy officer he could
identify was WINTERS, and he knew of no details about
KOVSHUK's relations with him. ’

Supervisor of All Code Clerk Operations

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for
supervising operations against American code clerks, he
found a very “difficult situation". Prior to the assignment
of KOSOLAPOV to the American Embassy Section in late 1959,
all operations against code clerks had been handled by
MALYUGIN, but during MALYUGIN's two years of effort there
had been no operational approaches and no successes. When
NOSENKO took over there were no active developmental
operations against code clerks under way, he stated, and
the only agents or operational contacts being used against
them were poorly educated maids and waitresses none of
whom had accomplished anything of importance. No non-Soviet
citizen agents were being used in operations against code-
room personnel,

According to NOSENKO, in January or February of 1960
GRYAZNOV was assigned to the American Embassy Section as a
Second assistant to NOSENKO in his code clerk activities.
From this point on, NOSENKO; KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV shared
the same KGB Headquarters office. There, all KGB files on
American code clerks as well as the files on all agents
available for work against them, were stored in one large
safe accessible to all three officers. NOSENKO supervised
all of. the section's. work along these: lines, and no provo-
cations, compromises, recruitment attempts, or recruitments
could have been Planned or carried out without his prior
knowledge and agreement when he was in Moscow. If NOSENKO
was absent on a trip, he would have been told about any such
activity upon his return,

NOSENKO said that he carefully directed the work of
GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing
their cases with them, taking part in operational planning,
and approving or disapproving all operational measures.

GOLITSYN's Information About KGB Operations Against Embassy
Code Clerks in 1960-1961 conmniel

The most significant collateral information about KGB
Operations against American code clerks in this period,
with which to compare NOSENKO's assertions fon this topic],
is that provided by GOLITSYN after his defection in 1961.

GOLITSYN identified KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV by name and
from photograph as being two veteran KGB officers, personally
known to him, who were in 1960 “working against code clerks
in the American Embassy in Moscow." With respect to the
priority attached to the recruitment of American code clerks
in 1960, GOLITSYN commented in 1961 that: "The task of
strengthening of work against Americans had been a standing
requirement, both in the past and most particularly [in
1960]. This work was particularly intensified after the
appointment of SHELEPIN.to the KGB... In 1960, it was
recommended in the KGB to intensify the work against the
Americans at the Embassy in Moscow, and against American
colonies in other, countries... This question of intensifying
work against the Americans was up before the Collegium of
the KGB. Thereafter there was a directive from SIIFLEPIN
regarding the intensification of work against the American
cipher-clerks."

GOLITSYN said that NOSENKO was not assigned to the Embassy
Section in 1960-1961, since if he had been GOLITSYN would
have known about it. |

Preparing for his assignment to Welsinki, GOLITSYN. in
the spring of 1960 visited the Embassy Section and learned ]
from GRYAZNOV that the latter had as an agent an Fmbassy
code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred to Helsinki.
The code clerk had already provided the KGB with some infor-
mation and he was considered by the KGB to be a “real”
agent. GOLITSYN was told by GRYAZNOV that, if the code clerk's
transfer materialized, GOLITSYN might have him in Helsinki
as his agent. |

GOLITSYN also. learned from GRYAZNOV in spring of 1960
that the latter had developed an operation against an
. Embassy military code clerk in which the KGB was. "99 per
cent, sure" that, the target would be recruited,

GRYAZNOV informed GOLITSYN in April or May ‘1960-that an
American’ employee ‘of the ‘Embassy in-Moscow, possibly:a code
clerk, was either recruited or prepared for recruitment on
the basis. of homosexual. compromise’ beginning in 1959. and
concluding in 1960.:. The KGB had photographed the American
in various homosexual: acts but SHELEPIN, who had “just become
Chairman of the KGB, at the time was’stressing ideological
rather than blackmail recruitments. “SHELEPIN said that the
“homosexual ‘blackmail was in-this instance “too dirty", and
the KGB should find another basis for. recruitment... SHELEPIN
did not exclude future use of the Photographs, which: the KGB
would hold in reserve.

While’on a temporary assignment to Helsinki in November
1960, V.V.. KOSOLAPOV told GOLITSYN that he.had. come-to
Helsinki in order. toaccompany :an’Embassy code clerk back
to Moscow on the train... KOSOLAPOV ‘planned to strike up an
acquaintance with the code clerk which he:-could continue
to develop in Moscow.:..In ‘September I961 a friend of :

_ KOSOLAPOV also visited Helsinki. on‘ temporary ‘duty... GOLITSYN

“tried to gét him:to talk-about KOSOLAPOV's ‘November train
operation, but -KOSOLAPOV's: friend would not: discuss the
“casé. . GOLITSYN. reasoned that there would be no reluctance

to discuss the case if it had been unsuccessful, and that
therefore KOSOLAPOV must have been ‘successful in developing
the, code clerk ‘onthe ‘train :or: afterwards;

GOLITSYN learned~in January:1961 from -v. M. Rovsittix that
‘the [Finnish a it~Johannes” ‘had recently been
used in ‘the successful recruitinent: of an American employee

According to official U.S. Government records,
Service Attaches of the Embassy in Moscow as

of 1960 shared a single cryptographic center
and a single military code clerk (except when
two code clerks overlapped during periods of
turnover). The military code clerk was respan~
sible for enciphering and deciphering the
traffic of all three military services. In
practice, at least one other member of the
Service Attaches' offices. in Moscow held a
cryptographic clearance and was trained to
replace the- regular military code clerk when
the_latter was absent. >

February 1960 to September 1961, when his ya

the State Department. The American was adamant in his
refusal, although he was ‘held in the hotel room all night
long. At about six o'clock in-the morning the KGB officers
received a telephoned report that the Embassy Marine guard
had called America House ‘to advise that the American. was
needed at the Embassy because an enciphered telegram had
arrived. The American was ‘then released.

The KGB "knew" that the American did not report the
recruitment attempt. Using that circumstance ‘for blackmail
rather than the incriminating photographs, the KGB planned
another attempt to recruit him if he ever returned abroad.

When the non-Soviet agent used in the first-year of
developing the American target had come to the attention of
GOLITSYN, GOLITSYN visited the Embassy Section :to see if he
could use him in First Chief Directorate Operations abroad.
NOSENKO was on leave at the time, but GOLITSYN talked with
another Embassy Section officer. GOLITSYN was told "Don't
touch him, he's ours", [The relevance of this incident is
discussed below.]

A proposal for the operation was prepared for the approvai
of the KGB Chairman which explained that code clerks were
assigned to Moscow usually only for one year [thus limiting
their accessibility to the KGB for development} and that it
was necessary to attempt to’place an agent near them even
before they arrived in Moscow. When the Chairman's approval
was granted, NOSENKO prepared the kharakteristika (official
form) on KOSOLAPOV for the trip and gave it to the Personnel
Office. KOSOLAPOV wrote a cable for Helsinki explaining that
he was coming for two or three days. NOSENKO didn't sign the
cable, but read it, and it was taken to KLYPIN for his signa-
ture and thereafter KOSOLAPOV took it to the Second (Furopean)
Department of the First Chief Directorate for release. There
was no other correspondence with the Helsinki rezidentura
concerning the operation before KOSOLAPOV departed Moscow.
NOSENKO discussed the plan with GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV and
"maybe" they discussed it with KOVSHUK the day before
KOSOLAPOV left. KOSOLAPOV had (SENNER = photograph and his06
name, and expected that the Helsinki” residency could obtain
a ticket for KOSOLAPOV: on(JENNER's ‘train. NOSENKO did not
recall precisely when KOSO POV left Moscow or under what
name he travelled. KOSOLAPOV was gone for about a week and
he travelled both ways by train.

+

NOSENKO read KOSOLAPOV's otchet (official account) of
his trip, and the: report of the female agent, "SOLISTKA".
According to those reports, KOSOLAPOV became acquainted on
the train with [SENNER) as planned, as did "SOLISTKA", whom
GRYAZNOV took #6 Vybérg and placed in (JENNER|'s car. 0b

OQ" SOLISTKA" gave (SENNEE| ner Moscow telephone number. While
‘in Helsinki KOSOLAPOV had spoken with the Rezident and Deputy
Rezident about obtaining their help in Helsinki with the
Work against code clerks, and about using Helsinki agents
against American code clerks en route to Moscow. . Nothing
came of the discussion, however; although the Rezident and
Deputy Rezident said they would see about it, the Embassy
Section later learned the Residency had "more important
questions".

Russian girl, "Yuliya", who acted’ surprised to see him and

KGB/Polish UB Operations Against, MORONE

At his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962 NOSENKO
made a passing reference to an operation in which he had
placed a female Potisn: up agent in contact with an unnamed
American from the Embassy while the latter was visiting
Warsaw and later brought the agent to Moscow to further
compromise the American. On 11 June 1962 NOSENKO was asked
whether he had foreign (non-Russian) agents working against
the American Embassy, and he replied that he himself
introduced the idea of using such agents to develop
Americans afraid of becoming involved with Russian girls.
He had several such agents, he said, and he sometimes asked
the East German and Polish security services to supply him
with such agents. As an example, NOSENKO cited the case
of a Marine guard and a code clerk from the Embassy who
travelled to Warsaw. The code clerk was intimate with a
Polish female agent, whom NOSENKO had planted in their
train compartment, on the train ‘to Warsaw, and later in
Moscow.

In an FBI:interview on 24 February 1964 NOSENKO

obeiesx d to the case again, and when the names of code

ob

clerk (Joseph MORONE} and Embassy Marine guard([Frank BEGGS] 06
were méntioned, he immediately identified them as the men
involved.

of NOSENKO's Information

(torong}' s case officer was NOSENKO's subordinate and
specialist in code clerk operations, KOSOLAPOV. NOSENKO read
the file on [MORONE) and saw his visa photograph, but never Ps
saw him in pérson. NOSENKO discussed the [HORONE] case with 86
KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV on a number of occaSions. Several
KGB agents were employed against [MORONE) including foreigners

Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations:
Summary and Cohelusion

According to’NOSENKO, on transfer to the Embassy Section,
operations against the American code clerks were the Section's
priority task and thus his most important single responsibility
as Deputy Chief. He asserts to be complete his awareness of
what was known to the KGB on this topic at the time, because
of his senior position, his personal review of relevant files
and correspondence, his personal direction of KOSOLAPOV and
GRYAZNOV, and his personal participation in their operations.
Without exception, in every one of the cases NOSENKO describes
there are facts substantially. at variance with his account,
in direct proportion to the amount of collateral information
available.

Conclusion

From the foregoing it is concluded that he was neither
Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section nor supervisor of all
operations against American code clerks. Consequently,
he would not necessarily have known of recruitments among
other Embassy personnel.

duties brought ABIDIAN into contact with KGB
officers stationed in New York and Washington
as well as among the Soviet delegations. One
of’the members of the Khrushchev entourage was
KOSOLAPOV, NOSENKO's subordinate in the Embassy
Section,

During his 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned
ABIDIAN in several instances, identifying him as the Embassy
Security Officer and as "a CIA officer" and describing his
letter-mailing activities. His knowledge of ABIDIAN was
attributed to his claimed position of Deputy Chief of the
Embassy Section.

After recontacting CIA in Geneva in 1964 NOSENKO for the
first time explicitly claimed to have been the KGB case
officer responsible for ABIDIAN in Moscow and for the first
time described ABIDIAN's alleged servicing of a deaddrop in
1960. NOSENKO has described ABIDIAN since 1964 as the sole
American for whom NOSENKO was personally accountable during
his 1960-1961 Embassy Section service, and one of the most
important counterintelligence targets of the Embassy Section
and therefore of the entire Second Directorate.

Duties as. a Case Officer
When he reported for duty in the Embassy Section NOSENKO

was told by KLYPIN and KOVSHUK that one of his duties would

be case officer for ABIDIAN, whose arrival in Moscow was

then expected in the near future. ABIDIAN was to be. the

only American target for whom NOSENKO personally was officially

accountable while he served in this section. KOVSHUK gave

NOSENKO such information as the section had on ABIDIAN.

-Included was ABIDIAN's visa application, the negative results

of checks of KGB Headquarters files, and a report prepared
by the American Department of the First Chief Directorate.
According to that’ report, which was based on correspondence
from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United States, ABIDIAN

had served as a Department of State Security Officer concerned
with ‘the safety of Premier Khrushchev when he visited the
United States in 1959; from ABIDIAN's behavior at that time,
the Legal Residencies concluded. he was an intelligence officer,
‘probably with CIA. That report. and the fact that ABIDIAN was

replacing the *known CIA officer Russell. LANGELLE as Security
Officer, made ABIDIAN one of the most important counter-
intelligence targets of the Embassy Section and therefore
of the. entire Second Chief Directorate. : :

“SuNOSENKO personally ‘opened’ the KGB file on ABIDIAN and.
later ‘adopted for him the cryptonym "ARSEN" used earlier by

“<NOSENKO was unsuccessful in his attempts to. learn more
“about, the life and career’ of ABIDIAN. He visited the -Chief
of the. American’ Department of the KGB First Chief Directorate,
. but that°unit had no‘ information not included in its original
report. NOSENKO requested that ‘the KGB Legal Residencies in
the United States’ be asked for further details, but none were
ever received... NOSENKO thus never’ learned of ABIDIAN's
education. and study abroad, date of entry-into the Department
of State, promotions, personal rank, previous assignments,
“military service, or foreign. service status::. .

Prior to ABIDIAN's .arrival;in Moscow, the: KGB decided not

was generally reduced in order to allow increased coverage
of British targets in connection with the PENKOVSKIY case.
As the responsible case officer, NOSENKO directed the
surveillance of ABIDIAN and evaluated the operational
possibilities offered by information from surveillance
reports,

In line with the emphasis on surveillance, the opera-
tional plan for ABIDIAN written by NOSENKO in October 1960
called for no direct action but specified that:

~ABIDIAN's maid Tatyana FEDOROVICH, an “operational
contact" of the Embassy Section, was to continue to apply
metka to ABIDIAN's clothing and "NEPTUNE-80" to his shoes.
(According to NOSENKO, these are surveillance aids. Metka
is a “thief powder" applied to clothing pockets, leaving a
trace on anything with which it comes into contact. Its
primary purpose is to.aid in the detection of operational
letters mailed by suspected foreign intelligence officers
and agents. NEPTUNE-80, applied to a target's shoes,
leaves a trace on the ground which the KGB even long after-
wards can follow with a dog.) The only item of information
received from FEDOROVICH was that ABIDIAN was having an
affair with an Embassy female employee. FEDOROVICH was
unable to find personal mail or personal Papers in ABIDIAN's
Apartment. :

-Pietro CECCHI, Embassy employee and KOSOLAPOV's
agent, was to try to cultivate ABIDIAN and report whatever
he learned concerning him. CECCHI never obtained any
significant information on ABIDIAN's personal life.
"ABIDIAN was developing CECCHI as an informant on American
personnel at the Embassy", but NOSENKO did not recall any
specific report CECCHI gave to ABIDIAN that was of interest
to the Embassy Section, :

~Two Embassy chauffeurs were to apply NEPTUNE-80 to
the floorboards and foot pedals of ABIDIAN's car if
necessary.

no further action was taken. [See below for ABIDIAN's
account of a similar incident, but one which Occurred in
Armenia.]

NOSENKO did not know the room number of ABIDIAN's office
in the Embassy or on what floor it was located, but he could
have checked, if necessary, with a copy of the Embassy tele-
Phone list published monthly, since it contained the office
room number of each American employee. [The Embassy telephone
list contained apartment, but not office room numbers.]
ABIDIAN's office was in the "Zone of Security" (i.e., secure
office areas). NOSENKO said that a report from an agent
(identity not recalled) indicated that there was a sign on |
ABIDIAN's office door which said "Security Office". [There
was no. such sign.] -NOSENKO was unable to determine if
ABIDIAN had a secretary. No dictation was monitored in
ABIDIAN's office because no KGB microphone was installed
there, [In 1964 a microphone, albeit then inoperative, was
found in’ the room occupied in 1960-1961 by ABIDIAN.] NOSENKO
recalled no particularly interesting or important information
about ABIDIAN obtained from other microphones in the Embassy.

NOSENKO did not know the location of ARIDIAN's apartment
in the Embassy building, nor how it was furnished, since
“data of this nature was not operationally significant
unless the target had shown vulnerabilities or was under
ae active development". :

Aware that-ABIDIAN travelled from the USSR two or three
times while stationed in Moscow, NOSENKO did not know to
which countries he went or the time of year when the trips
were made. Such information would have been of interest to
. him as ABIDIAN's case officer since, like LANGELLE's earlier
trips abroad, ABIDIAN's trips were presumed to be for |

‘With reférence:.to whether the KGB could have photographed

Receiving, reading, and filing all reports of
surveillance and other operational activity carried
out by various KGB units.

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps. Even
if he were absent when such a request for travel was made,
he would have seen all documents upon his return; he did
not recall seeing any such documents in ABIDIAN's file.

Comment: ABIDIAN who is of Armenian origin and speaks
the Armenian language with a high degree of
proficiency, made a trip to Armenia between 5
and 9 October 1960. While in Armenia ABIDIAN
visited with various churchmen, their parish-
ioners and an Armenian who had repatriated from
Greece in 1946. ABIDIAN attended a service in
Echmiadzin celebrating the anniversary of the
accession ‘of the Katolikos VAZGEN I, and also
visited some relatives of his in or near the
city of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow,
an Armenian whom ABIDIAN met on that trip
tried to contact ABIDIAN at the Embassy, but
ABIDIAN refused to see him.

After being told ABIDIAN had attended a
service celebrating the. fifth anniversary of
the Armenian Katolikos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO
recalled that ABIDIAN had gone. to Echmiadzin
and that an agent: had reported a contact with
him there. This agent, NOSENKO recalled, was
a priest or a monk, and the report concerned
only his conversation with ABIDIAN; the agent
had ‘no further contact with him. NOSENKO said
that this was his sole recollection concerning
ABIDIAN's trip.

With reference to ABIDIAN's travel to
Armenia in October 1960, NOSENKO recalled
having. been on leave at the time. However,
NOSENKO's reconstruction of the timing of his
alleged leave still placed him in Moscow at
the time of ABIDIAN's trip. In 1966, NOSENKO
-stated that he had lied, that his 1960 leave
was taken in January, not October.

Except, for the American woman with whom ABIDIAN was
thought,,to have been. intimate, -_NOSENKO knew none of Y
ABIDIAN's close American friends in Moscow nor his close
friends and professional contacts‘ among foreigners there,

NOSENKO received and read transcripts of all telephone
calls that ABIDIAN made or received at his office and
apartment via the Moscow city telephone system, but he
recalled none of their. names nor nationalities, because

there was nothing of interest in’ the conversations,

At the end of the January-February 1965 ‘interrogations
concerning ABIDIAN NOSENKO acknowledged that he knew little
about this important KGB target. He was "working badly" as
ABIDIAN's case. officer, he said, because he had had to
. concentrate on supervising the work against code clerks.

ABIDIAN's Letter Mailings

During. the 1962 meetings with NOSENKO: in Geneva, he
reported KGB knowledge of ABIDIAN's mailing of at least
three clandestine letters, in each case to KGB-controlled
, agents. ‘ According to NOSENKO, the KGB.detected,all the
letters mailed. by. ABIDIAN through..the use of metka. He
cautioned the CIA representatives from further use of Embassy
‘employees for'’mailing letters to agents in the Soviet
Union..\, He noted that after LANGELLE, no such letters were
mailed for a year anda half, until ABIDIAN mailed séveral.;
“He ‘explained that’Embassy employeés': servants applied an
‘~odorless. substance (metka) to clothing pockets,:and traces
of the substance rubbed off on any.thing it contacted, such
as.a-letter.: All ‘the letters mailed in Moscow were passed
;, through a machine which’ ‘identified letters’ bearing. tracing
of metka, he said, and this was. how letters ABIDIAN mailed
were intercepted. ©.[NOSENKO said the machine was a fotoapparat,
“) literally a camera, ‘but presumably hemeant some sort of
/ light-sensitive’ device.]° NOSENKO recalled that ABIDIAN had
mailed.a letter to someone in Odessa, and two to. the Baltic
“area, ‘probably to Riga, and ‘all weré detected by metka, not
by ABIDIAN's. surveillants. According to NOSENKO, no new
agents were discovered, however, since all of the agents to

Comment: NOSENKO's information is substantially correct,
that no letters were mailed for one and a half
years after LANGELLE's expulsion, and that
ABIDIAN mailed two or three letters, including
ones to the Baltic area and to Odessa. No
jetters were mailed from February 1960 until
ABIDIAN mailed one on 1 April 1961, and of the
three letters ABIDIAN mailed, one was to Odessa
and one each to Latvia and Estonia.

CIA has conducted tests to determine whether
a substance such as metka was being used as a
KGB control device, “Ultra-violet, chemical
and microscopic analyses developed one possible
use of a metka like substance. Analysis of an
article of clothing of a foreign diplomat in
Moscow who served as a CIA support agent
produced a sharply positive reaction.

NOSENKO later described how metka was applied to ABIDIAN's
clothing by his maid and how, in particular, this. led to
the discovery Of the letters ABIDIAN mailed.to the agent in
_ Odessa and to his parents in the United States.

"ABIDIAN!s maid in Moscow was Tatyana FEDOROVICH.
She was an operational contact reporting to ARTEMOV.
She started to work. for ABIDIAN a few months after
his arrival, perhaps three months but no longer than
six months after his arrival. I met her shortly
after she began to work for ARIDIAN in order to get
acquainted, with her, in order to evaluate her and
give her general instructions about her work for

meeting but it was before the fall of 1960. 1

working for ABIDIAN. This operational plan stated

this. every two. or three weeks except for a few times
“when she was:sick or on leave. No one else had

ABIDIAN's Servicing of the Pushkin Street Deaddrop Site

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that in 1960
or in early 1961 the KGB had surveilled ABIDIAN visiting
what was believed to be a deaddrop site on Pushkin Street
in Moscow. He provided additional details when questioned
again in 1965.

NOSENKO's Information

In 1960 or.early 1961, while NOSENKO was his responsible
case officer, ABIDIAN was surveilled from the Embassy to a
residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow. A KGB
stationary surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN leave
with the Publications Procurement Officer of the Embassy in
a chauffeured ‘automobile, rather than in the car he normally
used. ABIDIAN's surveillance team followed the car to a
bookstore. Both Americans. entered the bookstore, but
shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone and walked around the
corner, where he entered a residential building next to a
meat market on Pushkin Street. The surveillance team saw
him go in but did not follow him. ABIDIAN emerged after a
few seconds. This unusual incident was reported by the
surveillance team té6 the KGB Seventh (Surveillance) Direct-
orate, and the building was inspected that same day by KOZLOV,
the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance
Directorate, and MATVEYEV, the Deputy Chief of the Second
Chief Directorate's American Department. Taking into account
the character of the building and its inhabitants, the
duration and circumstances of ABIDIAN's visit, and the
suitability of the hallway - particularly the radiator in
it - for use as a deaddrop site, it was decided by the leader-
ship of the Second Chief Directorate and the Surveillance

Directorate that a stationary surveillance post should
immediately be set upto cover this location. ° Because. of
the short time available, it was not possible to place. this
post inside the building, so it was set up across the street.
In addition, the radiator was checked daily to see if. any-
thing, such as a magnetic container, had been concealed behind
it.’ The post was’ manned around the: clock: for 30 days, after
which it was maintained from. 0800 until midnight for another
two months. . Ifa package or magnetic. container had ‘been
found behind the radiator, which was: checked every morning,
it was planned to attach to it very thin wires to trigger a
signal should someone. remove the package. ‘At the same time
a member of the surveillance team would be stationed’ on the
landing of the staircase in this building, out.of sight from
the hallway below. During the three months that the post
was maintained, nothing. was found concealed behind. the radiator ;
nor were any suspicious persons seen entering or leaving the
building.) Thepost was then discontinued, but the address
was. placed on a list.of suspicious places inspected daily

by the Surveillance Directorate. The true significance of
this’ location became ‘known to the KGB only later, after the
arrest of PENKOVSKIY in 1962... : : :

NOSENKO. first heard of. ABIDIAN's: visit to. the suspected
, deaddrop site on: the day .it occurred... He was sitting. in
KOVSHUK's ‘office whén he réceived a telephone call from
“MATVEYEV telling him of the incident. «Although NOSENKO was
ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVSHUK was Chief of the Embassy
Section, the. decision .to.place the stationary surveillance
post at the site was madé at.a higher level; neither of them
was involved in it or inthe later decision to discontinue
the post.’ NOSENKO himself visited the building on Pushkin

,, Street the following day or the day after, but he remained

oniy a few minutes and did not. recall any details of. the
hallway, except that theré was a radiator there,

"As ABIDIAN's case officer, NOSENKO recalled receiving the
surveillance report of his visit to the Pushkin Street building
and placing: this report in ABIDIAN's file. (This case file”
NOSENKO turned over to his successor, GRYAZNOV, about
28 December 1961, just before he transferred to the Seventh
Department.) : a :

NOSENKO received no written reports on the results of the
stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss this matter
with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during the first month
of surveillance, and periodically after that. These discus-
sions took place either by telephone, when KOZLOV was
visiting NOSENKO,'s office, or when NOSENKO visited KOZLOV's
office in KGB Headquarters. From KOZLOV or perhaps someone
else, NOSENKO learned that the post had been discontinued
after 90 days. On the basis of these conversations with
KOZLOV, NOSENKO knew that nothing of interest occurred
during the period of the stationary surveillance.

NOSENKO was in the Embassy Section during all the period
that the stationary surveillance post was watching the
Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard from KOZLOV
that the post had been replaced by periodic inspections.

NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance on
the Pushkin Street deaddrop site to his CIA contacts in
Geneva in June 1962 because by that time the post had
already been discontinued without anything unusual or
suspicious having been noted, and he thought that this
incident would be of no particular interest to CIA.

When last asked whether he had visited the Pushkin Street
address several days after ABIDIAN had been seen there, as

‘he had earlier said, NOSENKO replied:

"I dont€ remember. I do not want to say that I
visited the deaddrop. I don't remember now whether
I visited it or not. It seems to me that I visited
it, but I don't remember. It seems that I visited
it. with KOZLOV, but I cannot say 'yes', and I cannot
say 'no'." : : :

Comment: (Continued)
nor filed the initial surveillance report of
ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin Street site. If
he transferred to the Seventh Department two
days after ABIDIAN's visit, as he claimed (and
NOSENKO's participation in the(Tl.E. JOHNSON] case 0¢
indicates that he was working against tourists
by 5 January 1962), he could neither have visited
the site as he described nor could he have
received thereafter the daily surveillance
reports. He could not, of his own knowledge,
assert that the surveillance was terminated
after three months, since well before the: three
months' surveillance ended he was abroad in
Geneva. Lastly, it cannot be for the reason
NOSENKO claimed (that the surveillance was
unsuccessful) that NOSENKO did not mention
ABIDIAN's activities to CIA in Geneva in 1962.

Case Officer for John ABIDIAN: Summary and Conclusion
Hi Tae ot

If for no other reason than ABIDIAN's security functions
with the Khrushchev entourage, files of the First Chief
Directorate would record his name: If NOSENKO states to
the contrary, that traces were negative, NOSENKO did not run
the traces himself nor know the results. According to
NOSENKO, ABIDIAN was “one of the most important targets of
the Second Chief Directorate"; all KGB resources were
employed for two years, including 24-hour surveillance, the
exploitation of all agents with access to him, audio sur-
veillance, and technical aids, with damost absolutely negative
results. The results could not have been negative: for
NOSENKO to so assert can only mean that NOSENKO was not
informed of the results. In the two instances NOSENKO cited
of Embassy agents' activities against ABIDIAN, he made
fundamental errors: ABIDIAN's maid was not employed by
ABIDIAN-~at the time NOSENKO insists she was applying the
metka, and GROMAKOVA taught AMIDIAN Russian throughout his
Stay in Moscow, not just “several times". NOSENKO acknowledges

and for the first time claimed case officer responsibilities
against American targets other than ABIDIAN. He related how,
at his meeting with KLYPIN and KOVSHUK on entering the section
in January 1960, KOVSHUK suggested that NOSENKO assume super-
visory responsibility for the service attaches while KOVSHUK
supervised operations against the civilian diplomatic staff
of the Embassy. NOSENKO stated “supervising" meant that the
case officers for the service attaches referred their ques-
tions to him, not to KOVSHUK. These included case officers
GAVRILENKO, responsible for Air Attaches, KURILENKO, for
Army Attaches, and DEMKIN, for enlisted personnel of all
services. “While he was getting acquainted with the section
on DRANOV's retirement", NOSENKO himself took case officer
responsibility for the Naval Attache personnel. This res-
ponsibility was subsequently assumed by DRANOV's former
assistant, BELOGLAZOV. NOSENKO could not initially recall
how long he supervised service attache operations; he later
said “several months" and finally "five or six months".
Ne3ther could NOSENKO recall what other pressing duty or
duties caused him to be relieved of this function. He said
this resulted from KOVSHUK's proposal that supervision of
the service attaches be assumed by ALESHIN who was Deputy
Chief of the Second Directorate's American Department and
coordinator for Second Directorate operations against
military intelligence officers of all nationalities.

Supervisor of Service Attache Operations:
Summary and Conclusion

Because of the tardiness of NOSENKO's claim to have been
responsible for operations against service attaches and
because he was not able, when challenged, to substantiate
his claims by providifig any details of KGB activities against
these targets, it is concluded that this. aspect of his
claimed KGB service’ is a fiction.

Custodian of KGB File on Embassy Security
noes 7 : :

As former Deputy Chief. and Occasional Acting Chief of the
American Embassy Section, NOSENKO' claimed awareness of KGB
knowledge of its American Embassy target. Specifically,.-

‘NOSENKO claimed to have been custodian of the Second Chief.

Directorate's file on Embassy: security.
NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO's knowledge of the physical layout of the Embassy

-derived both from his general supervisory functions during

1960-1961 ‘and from his. responsibilities as the officially”
registered custodian of the KGP file on the Embassy security.
He received the file from:the Section Chief, KOVSHUK, when
he arrived in January 1960.. As. was permissible under KGB
procedures, as long as the custodian was: still in the same
directorate, the’ file was charged to BAKHVALOV. [See p.' 153.
for NOSENKO's various assertions with respect to BAKHVALOV.}

".NOSENKO -had custody of the file charged to himself, and -from

January. 1960 until NOSENKO was leaving the section on 25-28.

“December 1961,’ only KOVSHUK, NOSENKO, and GRYAZNOV and
~ KOSOLAPOV (both of whom shared NOSENKO's office and: safe) had
access to the file. :

° the ‘file consisted. of two volumes, one for the ola’
building on Mokhovaya Street ‘and the second (about-an inch>

thick) on. the new Embassy building occupied in 1953 on ;
‘Chaykovskiy Street. The file contained detailed floor plans

and photographs “of both buildings.

-No operational analysis or, planning by NOSENKO or others
was done on. the basis.of this “file during NOSENKO'S two: years
in the Embassy Section: It was used only for reference i
purposes, since the KGB had concluded that it was impossible
for a ‘Soviet citizen to penetrate the secure areas of the
Embassy because of the American security precautions in
effect, | * .

All Soviet employees of the Embassy who entered the
xvestricted areas, "the seventh through the tenth floors",
were carefully questioned because of the special KGB interest
in these offices, [The secure area barred to unescorted
local employees is comprised of the eighth through tenth
floors.] :

NOSENKO personally placed some reports by KGB agents in
the Embassy security file, while he was custodian. None of
the information was of interest or important or useful
enough for him to remember, and he recalled none of the KGB
agent sources. [In another context NOSENKO cited an instance
in which an unrecalled KGB agent had reported [erroneously]
that ABIDIAN's office had a sign on the door reading “Security
Office".]

Nothing could be recovered from the Embassy classified
trash, which was always burned at an unrecalled location by
a non-commissioned officer or Marine guard accompanied by
an officer. [At the Moscow Embassy the Marine guard detailed
for the purpose has always burned the classified trash alone.
NOSENKO may be unwittingly referring to a U.S. military
security procedure requiring a commissioned officer to witness
and to certify ,the destruction of classified documents. If
NOSENKO is aware of any such procedure, he has never indicated
it in any context.]

In 1960-1961, when NOSENKO was Deputy Chief, he either
knew the location of all offices and personnel within the
Embassy or he could obtain them from the monthly Embassy
telephone lists which the KGB received regularly from agents.
The lists gave office numbers. [The Embassy telephone lists
contain names, apartment numbers and telephone numbers, but
omits office room numbers.]

In 1960 a "metallic chamber" (acoustical room) arrived
at the Embassy for President Eisenhower's use and for secret
conversations. None of the technical specifications of the
room were known, nor was its location. An unrecalled source
reported only that meetings were held in the room, which was
in the restricted area.

NOSENKO's Information

Handling.of Monitor Reports

According to NOSENKO, only a limited number of KGB
personnel, all in the American Department of the Second
Chief Directorate, had access to the monitor reports. These
included Department Chief KLYPIN (but not his deputies),
KOVSHUK, NOSENKO himself, and GRIBANOV, to whom important
items were shown. The existence of the audio operation and
its product were concealed from personnel in other KGB
Departments. The reports were produced by the Second Special
Department of the Operational Technical Directorate (OTU).
The OTU Second Special Department has several sections, one
of which was the English Section under Colonel N. Ya. KUZMIN.
KUZMIN's monitors, fluent in English, listened to and
transcribed the tape recordings. Their reports of the
preceding: day's product were brought daily by Tatyana
GRISHNYAT (of the Second Special Department) to the American
Department. (In some accounts NOSENKO has said that he
received the reports first, at other times that they went
first to KLYPIN.) NOSENKO reviewed the reports, marked
significant portions and usually within twenty-four hours
returned the reports to the Second Special vepartment.

In. NOSENKO's absence either KOVSHUK.or GRYAZNOV reviewed the
reports. The Second Special Department. prepared sterile
abstracts of the portions NOSENKO had marked, abstracts
which disguised the source of the information contained:

the abstracts were returned to the American Department for
the reference of individual case officers in the Embassy
Section and for filing in the delo~formulyar (developmental
file) kept on each American employee in the Embassy.

Location of the Microphones

In the 1962 Geneva meetings with CIA, NOSENKO emphasized
that the KGB was listening to all conversations of the
service attaches and particularly, to conversations held in
the office of the Minister Counsellor. In addition, he
referred to "points" [microphones] in the office of an
unnamed State Department employee, in the Agricultural
Attache office shared by BROWN and HORBALY, and in the
Embassy code room.

In 1964, at the second meeting with CIA, NOSENKO produced

a handwritten note which he asserted listed all the micro-
phones in the Embassy which were operative in the years
1960-1961. NOSENKO explained that at the.end of 1960 or
the beginning of 1961, he and KOVSHUK met with Department
Chief. KLYPIN. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss
the possibility of releasing monitors from some of the
Embassy microphones so they could be ‘assigned to Vladimir
PETROV, Chief of the American Department's Second Section
for. use against non-Embassy targets. (PETROV had earlier
requested English~language monitors from the Second Special
Section, but“had been told that English linguists were ~
engaged on priority targets.). At the meeting, KOVSHUK' and
‘KLYPIN reviewed the microphoné coverage of the Embassy
“chancery to decide which rooms offered information of little
value,’ so that: the monitors for those’ ‘microphones could ‘be
released to PETROV'S Second Section,. KOVSHUK used NOSENKO's
notebook (in .which. to list Embassy apartments’ and offices
then. being covered ‘on. a full-time basis and to note those of

‘ arily, monitoring of Embassy apartments. He continued the

NOSENKO said that "many" microphones were installed in
the chancery building before the Americans occupied it, but
he did not know how many were installed in all, how many
were in any particular room on KOVSHUK's list, or where they
were located in specific rooms. He did recall that most of
the microphones were emplaced in the outside wall, the wall
nearest Chaykovskiy Street, as most of the offices faced
this street and microphones emplaced there were less vulner-
able to technical search and discovery.

According to NOSENKO, there were no fixed microphones in
America House, the Embassy quarters of enlisted military
personnel. In 1960-1961 there had been a discussion of using
KGB agents employed there to emplace temporary audio devices
for one or two days at a time in the rooms of the Americans,
as well as in the Embassy garage- These plans were vetoed;
however, because of the risk of discovery. For the same
reason there was no attempt made in this period to emplace
a device temporarily in Spasso House, the Ambassador's
residence, or in the apartments of Embassy officers. The
KGB was afraid that they would be detected and there would
be a scandal.

Performance Characteristics of the Microphones

According to NOSENKO in 1962, the audibility of the
microphones in 1960-1961 ranged from very clear to zero,
put the microphone system was deteriorating. The KGB could
ao nothing about it because they could not gain access to
the inside of ‘the Embassy. Referring to the. microphone in
the Minister Counsellor's office, NOSENKO said that it was
becoming increasingly aifficult tovwork with its product.
The microphone was fading, and the recording tape sounded
as if “somewhere far away, Somewhere in the cellar, someone
is speaking ina whisper". - KUZMIN, the KGB officer respon~
sible for the monitors, said that soon the KGB could recover
nothing. Of the microphones then (in 1962) in place, about
twenty no longer were operative.

In 1964 NOSENKO referred again to the microphone in the
Minister Counsellor's office. NOSENKO learned from
DMITRIYEV [Deputy Chief of the English-language Section of
OTU.Second Special Department] how difficult it was to

monitor conversations in. that office, ‘Only very experienced
linguists were used, but even they had to listen “ten, =
fifteen, even twenty times" in order to understand portions
of the recording. After NOSINKO left the Embassy Section,

attributed the diminishing value. of the audio operation to
the Embassy use of the “room-in-a-room". _[NOSENKO said :
that in- 1960-1961 the KGB: had information that, in prepara=
tion for President Eisenhower's visit, a "steel chamber"

Microphones in’ the’ North Wing

According to. NOSENKO,. no microphones or other audio
devices were ever installedin the north wing (as distinct
from the. chancery) prior to.the Embassy's occupancy of the
building in 1962. In his first meetings with CIA in. Geneva
he described how he knew. When it was decided to permit. =

Amount, Type, and Value of Audio Surveillance Production

In 1962 while citing examples of the kind of information
the KGB obtained from monitoring, NOSENKO referred only to
the offices of the Minister Counsellor and of the service
attaches. According to NOSENKO, Counsellor FREERS dictated
Top Secret and Secret cables. If the content justified,
GRIBANOV was informed and he notified the KGB Chairman
immediately. FREERS also dictated fitness reports on Embassy
personnel from which the KGB learned of various American
officers' personal weaknesses. With respect to the service
attaches, NOSENKO said that the KGB learned from microphones
where they intended to travel, and what they wanted to find
out.

In 1964 NOSENKO provided some additional details. He
said that audio reception was good from the military code
room, but that the occupants rarely spoke, When one of them
was monitored, the monitor report was sent immediately to
the Eighth Directorate which was concerned with ciphers.
Nothing was obtained from the State Department code room and
teletype room because of the interference from the noise of
the teletype machines. The microphones in the apartments
produced rarely anything of interest. An exception was
advance information obtained of a social affair, for which
the English-language Section of the OTU Second Special
Department would be asked to pay particular attention. There
was a microphone with good reception in GLEYSTEEN's (a
political officer) office, but no secret information was
obtained, Similarly, the conversations were overheard in
the Agricultural Attache office, but nothing significant
was obtained except "something" which made the KGB suspect
HORBALY was connected with American Intelligence.

In a protocol signed on 26 October 1965 NOSENKO summarized
his knowledge of the value of the information obtained by
the KGB via microphones in the Embassy:

Results of Technical-and Physical Search

NOSENKO's information [no action had been taken as a
result. of GOLITSYN's earlier report that there was’ a micro-
phone in the Embassy office occupied by the Minister
Counsellor] was, as far as it went, confirmed by a search
of the Embassy.chancery in spring 1964. According ‘to the
“ USIB. Security. Committee damage ‘report which followed, a
microphone and associated probe was first discovered in the
outside ‘wall behind ‘a radiator in Room 1008 of the chancery.
-{In-1960. this room.had been the office of the Army Attache, .
where’ .NOSENKO. reported a microphone. was emplaced.]~- The
microphone's: cable was traced to a major cable which ran
horizontally (several-inches) under the outside surface of
the east face of the chancery, to the roof area of the’ north
annex... A. number. of vertical‘ cables were found to run to the
various microphone: installations. | Fifty microphones were
positively. identified [ultimately, fifty-four were found],

‘although the system apparently was devised for a considerably
greater number. ‘The microphone system covered all outside
rooms on floors six through ten, with certain exceptions.

The USIB damage report, concluded that the microphones were
installed before the. Embassy took occupancy: of the chancery
in 1953.

The discoveries in the chancery led. to the discovery of-

Parallel to the audio cable running from the: chancery to the

knowledge as to the effectiveness of United States operations
within the Soviet Union, particularly the military attache
collection program. Soviet knowledge of U-S. emphasis upon
certain intelligence collection areas has made it possible
for them to identify priority intelligence and probably
Soviet targets and thereby permitted them to implement
specific counteractions. The Soviets over the years must
have amassed considerable information concerning the personal
i habits, problems, attitudes and weaknesses of personnel

i assigned to the Embassy which can be used by them for purposes
Site | of exploitation at any time of their choosing in the future."

Col. Theodore F. HOFFMAN, Army Attache in Moscow from
May 1959 to May 1961 (a period coinciding with some eighteen
months of NOSENKO's claimed two years' service in the Embassy
Section), has been more specific. Interviewed by CIA, Col.
HOFFMAN recalled instances which the KGB, by monitoring just
the conversations held in his. office, could have become aware
of the vulnerability of service attache personnel. As
: examples, he cited the two occasions on which military code
H il pe clerk aber reprimanded for absenteeism (unavailable

for cipher duties because he was elsewhere with "girl

: friends"); HOFFMAN's conversations with America House manager

Ob eter BINDER (the personality probiéms, drinking ‘habits and

: other incidents relating to America House residents and

visitors to the America Club), and the detailed circumstances
prompting the decision to remove substitute code clerk(KEYSERS) }6
from Moscow (homosexuality)... [Besides his general duties as
Chief of the Embassy Section, NOSENKO claims special: responsi-
bilities for each of the persons mentioned. He supervised
the KGB officers operating against code clerks and residents
of America House, and asserts he was personally involved in
the KGB attempts to recruit (STORSBERGI and (KEYSERS \6!(The KGB
attempted later to recruit BINDER, ’as well.) j In aumming up
his views, Col. HOFFMAN said: "To be perfectly frank, I
would assume that ... some of our modus operandi, some of
our targets, some of the results, and all 6f our personal
weaknesses were compromised."

States relations (and hence of priority interest to the KGB),
as the U-2 and President Eisenhower's visit. Of the micro-
phones which produced useful information, NOSENKO describes
those in the Minister Counsellor's office, the office of

the Army Attache, and in the code room; when challenged to
cite examples of information obtained, he-asserts that none
produced any information of interest to the Embassy Section-
Lastly, although he stresses the value of the chancery
microphones as sources of information on which he rdied to
direct operations against code clerks and other Embassy
personnel, he again can describe no actual instance. In

the single case in which he asserted that he relied on
information procured from microphones. (KEYSERS! failure to0b
report receipt of the defection invitation), he was in error.

Conclusion

From the foregoing it is concluded that, NOSENKO's claims
to the contrary, his information on the chancery microphones
does not sustain his claim either to have been Deputy Chief
of the Embassy Section, or his claim that he personally
reviewed the KGB microphone monitoring reports.

Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications

As former Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section of the
American Department NOSENKO claimed to be knowledgeable of
the extent of KGB success in its cryptologic-attack on
Embassy communications, He has consistently asserted that
the KGB had never succeeded in reading enciphered communica~
tions of the service attaches [for which reason he claimed

in the information as it did not relate to agents or agent
activities. NOSENKO noted, however, that the material
concerned messages from the Secretary of State to the American
Ambassador, Moscow. All of this material was highly sensi~
tive, and few people were permitted to see it or even to

know of its existence. NOSENKO stated that it was treated
more carefully than Top Secret information.

Unable to describe the techniques of the KGB Eighth
Directorate in breaking U.S. Department of State crypto-
graphic systems, NOSENKO nevertheless did indicate methods
as known to him. One method, mentioned by NOSENKO on
12 June 1962, stemmed from the habit of certain Embassy
officials (notably Ministers Counsellor FREERS and McSWEENEY)
dictating the text of outgoing cables aloud. When the texts
were picked up on the KGB microphones, the Eighth Directorate
compared them against enciphered traffic intercepted by
other means.

NOSENKO has referred to the Eighth Directorate's interest
in equipment sounds and snatches of technical conversations
picked up by the microphones in the State Department and
military code rooms.

"Now, we also listened to the code room and the
teletype office, but we could never get anything out
of the teletype office because of interference
[equipment noises which drowned out conversations] t
In the military code room--that was where {Games H.10
STORSBERG jand later (Matthew P.] ZUIUS) workéd--we
didn't get much. We could hear[STORSBERG| swear ing(j,
on occasion, and then he would méntion a group of
numbers. This was, of course, all recorded and we
turned it over at once to the Eighth Directorate,
dealing with coding and decoding. Of course, all
other intercepts were turned over to them also."

With respect to the use of code clerks by the American
Department, NOSENKO recalled that in 1948 or 1949 the KGB
was helped a great deal by [James H.] McMILLAN la military
code clerk of the Embassy staff who defected in 1948], and
by “ANDREY" [Dayle SMITH, see p. 33]. It was thanks to

“ANDREY's" help that the KGB were able to read State Depart-
ment and ciphers. [At the time of. SMITH's tour in Moscow :

a single code room was shared’ by State. Department and 2
military. code clerks. As.the only cryptographic machine °
technician assigned to the Embassy, SMITH had access to. both
“state and military cryptographic equipment.]

NOSENKO also named MARTIN and MICHELL [NSA mathematicians
who defected to. the USSR in July 1960] and: "an American
code-clerk brought to the USSR from India" .{unidentified,
but possibly John Discoe’ SMITH, State Department communica-
tions technician who defected to the USSR sometime between
1960-1967,. when -his: presence inthe. USSR was publicized]...

NOSENKO said the Eighth Directorate :was submitting :
regular’ reports'to Khrushchev and the Central Committee on
their. intercepts until "the end of 1961 or. the beginning
of 1962". He learned this from GRYAZNOV, his successor in,
the Embassy Section. At about-the same time he learned
that various Embassy officers were less. often overheard from
KGB. microphones in their offices discussing significant
information. . This development GRYAZNOV and American Depart-
ment Chief FEDOSEYEV attributed ‘toa “room-within-a-room" *.

Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications:
Summary and Conclusion

From USIB and’ NSA damage assessments following the
discovery of the microphones in the chancery, it has been
concluded that it was equally feasible for the Soviets to
have recovered plain text (by analysis of cipher machine
emissions) from enciphered service attaché traffic of the
period 1952-1962, and from enciphered State Department
traffic during 1952-1959. “ANDREY" (see P- 33), the code
machine mechanic the KGB allegedly recruited in 1953,
serviced the cipher machines in a common State-service
attache code room; his access was not limited, as NOSENKO
indicates, to State Department traffic. On the basis of
these fundamental errors, it is concluded that NOSENKO
was not knowledgeable of the extent of KGB eryptologié
attack on Embassy communications, and that such information
as he provided can not be related to his claim to have
been Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section.

Knowledge of CIA Personnel within Embassy

As Deputy Chief and occasional Acting Chief of the
American Embassy Section, NOSENKO claimed that he would
“necessarily know whom the KGB knew or suspected to be a
CIA officer" under diplomatic cover within the Embassy.
Within the section, “special emphasis" was placed on the
identification and development of American Intelligence.
personnel, with the objective of an eventual recruitment.
The KGB believed that the Ambassador, code clerks, ‘and
Marine guards would not be used to perform intelligence
missions: any diplomat, however, was noted as “suspect

WINTERS was known to be a CIA officer and was given
special attention because of his operational activity in the
POPOV case (see p.207 ). KOVSHUK was in personal contact
with WINTERS under the cover of the Ministry of Foreign Af-
fairs. In addition he was overheard from! a KGB microphone
dictating an intelligence report shortly after he returned

NOSENKO did not recognize BROWN's name, whose name was
on a list which NOSENKO brought to CIA in 1964, a list in-
dicating that BROWN shared an office with HORBALY. In that

no interesting information concerning GARBLER from microphones,

Knowledge of CIA Personnel in Embassy:
ummary and Conclusion

With the exception of ABIDIAN, there is a paradox
connected with each of NOSENKO's identifications, as is
most evident in the cases of [MORELL} and GARBLER. It is a 06
fact that both these individdals wére known to the KGB as
CIA officers, a fact of which NOSENKO apparently is unaware.
His claim is thus false, that he would necessarily know
whom the KGB believed was a CIA officer, and to the extent
he related it to his claim that he was Deputy Chief of the
Embassy Section, that latter claim is unsubstantiated.

Personal Handler of KGB Agents

NOSENKO has named seven agents which he claimed to have
handled while Deputy Chief of the American Section during
1960-1961. 7

YEFREMOV and VOLKOV

NOSENKO continued to manage these two. homosexual agents
whom he had recruited and managed during his assignment in
the Seventh Department, and brought with him when he trans-
ferred to the American Department (see p.1l1l). They were
used in no operations during _the period 1960-1961. [NOSENKO
described the compromise of Robert BARRETT) in 1959 and knew (6

Travel to Cuba (November-December 1960)

When NOSENKO first mentioned his travel to Cuba (in
1962, in Geneva), he claimed that he travelled under the
NIKOLAYEV alias, and he provided colorful details of his
activities in Havana in surveying the American Embassy
there for operational possibilities. In subsequent versions
NOSENKO asserted that he travelled in true name, and that
his was a routine assignment to accompany a Soviet delegation
as a security officer.

NOSENKO's Information

In the latter part of 1960, at the same time as he was
preparing for his intended trip to the United States, a
special delegation of nickel industry experts from Gosptan,
the Soviet State Planning Commission, was preparing for
departure for Cuba. The delegation was a routine one,
consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of
the Soviet Union. Since there was no one under any sort of
suspicion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abroad) Depart-
ment of the Second Chiéf Directorate decided it was unnec-
essary to include a security officer. two days prior to
the departure of the group, ‘however, the Central Committee j
of the Communist Party ordered that a Second Chief Direct-
orate officer accompany the group. Because of the short
time remaining before the delegation's scheduled departure,
the Eleventh Department protested that it would be impossible |
to find a suitable officer who could get his necessary
travel documents ready in time. At this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV
of the Eleventh Department suggested NOSENKO, who had been
supposed to go to the United: States and who hada valid
passport (in true name). The Cubans issued NOSENKO a visa
immediately as did The Netherlands a transit visa. |

NOSENKO's functions with the delegation were purely of
a security nature, He flew with the delegation to Cuba in
October or November and spent about a month and a half |
there. During this time he accompanied the delegation

Comment: NOSENKO doesn't know why he was selected to
consult with the MVR in Bulgaria. As far
as is known to CIA, such consultation was a
function of the KGB advisors in Sofia whom
NOSENKO himself described. The American
Legation (after a ten-year absence) reopened
in February 1960. By 1961 the MVR had demon-
strated that it had lost none of its earlier
demonstrated efficiency in controlling the
activities of resident foreigners and in
establishing the basis for mounting operations
against American diplomats. There was no
apparent necessity for NOSENKO's Sofia assign-
ment, and therefore his account is judged to
be untrue.

NOSENKO stated that-his return to the Seventh Department
resulted from GRIBANOV's wish to promote him from Deputy
Chief of the Embassy ‘Section to Deputy Chief of. the.whole
American Department... However; according to NOSENKO, the
new American Department Chief, FEDOSEYEV, wanted as his

NOSENKO. said he preferred ‘to be transferred back to the

with the understanding ‘that he would be’ appointed Deputy

Comment:

NOSENKO dates his transfer as occurring “before
GOLITSYN's defection", which he insists
occurred in mid-January 1962 even after. learning
from CIA that the correct date is 15 December
1961. Obliged to take the latter date into
account, NOSENKO reconstructed the foregoing
chronology of his departure from the Embassy
Section and his assumption of duties in the
Embassy Section and his assumption of duties
in the Seventh Department. Repeated interro~
gation has never resolved the reason NOSENKO
attached so much significance to the date on
which he believes GOLITSYN defected.

In claiming to have transferred from the
Embassy Section just prior to 5 January 1962
(when his participation in the Seventh Depart~
ment compromise of [W.E. JOHNSON jis confirmed) 06
NOSENKO's account makes it impossible for him
to have played the role he claimed in the events
connected with ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin
Street deaddrop. (see P+ 216-)

NOSENKO's assertion that he was GRIBANOV'S
candidate over KOVSHUK for Deputy Chief of the
American Department is implausible. . In contrast
to NOSENKO's self-admitted undistinguished
performance, KOVSHUK was a former Deputy Chief

of the American Department who had been personally

invotved in such American Department operations
of the previous decade as recruitments of Roy
RHODES and Dayle SMITH, and the development of

CIA officers WINTERS and |MORELL and the interro- (f

gation of CIA officer ELLE, and the more

CHAPTER VIII

SEVENTH DEPARTMENT {January 1962 to January 1964;

J Comment: By late 1959 or early 1960 the KGB had the
complete substance of the CIA and MI-6 tourist
| agent program in the USSR. The information eb-
ies tained from the KGB agent in MI-6, BLAKE, in-
cluded accurate details of the objectives and
targets of those operations, as well as the
| practices employed for the selection, recruit-
ment, training and briefing of the agents in-
volved. As a probable consequence of reports
received from BLAKE as well as by the indepen-
dent confirmation of tourist agents identified
in the USSR, the KGB by 1961 was mobilizing all
| of its resources to counter the threat. The

KGB's tasks were made no easier by the increase
in bona fide tourists to the Soviet Union, the
numbers of which were increasing by thousands
annually. Evidently uncertain of the success
of domestic measures it was taking, the KGB
Soe . extended responsibility for countermeasures to
| KGB elements outside of the Second Chief Direc~
torate. To that end, selected First Chief
Directorate residencies abroad were instructed
| to exploit all of its facilities in developing
tourist agent countermeasures. In describing
the magnitude of its tourist agent problem,
KGB Headquarters cited the scores of American
tourist agents who had been identified in just
one year in the Soviet Union.

In fact, by the time NOSENKO returned to
the Seventh Department in January 1962, the
threat against which the KGB was deploying had
passed. By early 1961 the tourist agent pro-
gram was suspended when technical collection
programs and other agent operations made the
use of tourists unnecessary.

tourists during this period must be examined

in light ‘of the foregoing facts. Since NOSENKO
claims to have held key KGB positions from
which vantage he asserts he was particularly
well informed about KGB operations against
American tourists, it is appropriate to hold
him closely accountable for his statements.

NOSENKO's claimed assignment to the Seventh Department,
first as Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section
and then as a Deputy and then First Deputy Chief of the
entire Department, extended from January 1962 until his de-
fection in Geneva in January 1964. By the time NOSENKO re-
turned to the Seventh Department for this assignment, the
KGB reorganization of 1959 had been completed, and according
to NOSENKO, the Department was divested of all of its former
functions unrelated to tourists. A newly~created Service
(sluzhba), NOSENKO explained, assumed responsibility for
foreign religious figures, emigres visiting the Soviet Union,
and persons: travelling to the USSR to visit relatives. The
Seventh Department's former xesponsibilities for operations
against foreign seamen, commercial delegations, and so forth

"were similarly transferred elsewhere.

In addition to performing supervisory and administrative
duties, NOSENKO asserted that in this period he personally
was involved with KGB operations launched against six Ameri-
can tourists and participated in investigations of Lee Harvey
OSWALD and of a disaffectéd KGB colleague from the American
Embassy Section, A.N. CHEREPANOV. In this period, also, he
travelled on two occasions to Geneva on missions unrelated to
his Seventh Department. duties.

Because of the senior position NOSENKO said he occupied
during his period of service in the Seventh Department, NOSENKO
claimed full awareness of all significant KGB operations
against American tourists.

Until 1960 or 1961 a Greek language instructor at the
Institute for International Relations, RYTOVA obtained a job
at a CPSU Central Committee school and thereafter ceased all
agent work. Nevertheless, NOSENKO asserted that he was offi-
cially registered.as her case officer until his defection in

NOSENKO's Agents: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims with respect to these agents do not sus-
tain his claims to service in the Seventh Department in this
period, since none were utilized in Seventh Department opera-
tions.

As Chief of the American-British Commcnwealth Section of
the Seventh Department during the period January-July 1962

YEFREMOV. NOSENKO frequently used the opera-
tional pseudonym Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV
and was called Georgiy. 6
* Although JOHNSON] appd¥ently confirmed
NOSENKO's rote, NOSENKO's version of the case
is incompatible with what must have been the
actual time frame. According to NOSENKO's
version, within five days of ‘OHNSON} s arriva1 (6
in Moscow the KGB had discoveréd that he was
a homosexual, concluded from "two or three"
censored letters that he was a threat, and ar-
ranged his entrapment. The rapid pace of

was already known to the KGB (if not to NOSENKO:

before [JoHNSoN}'s arrival in Moscow. NOSENKO's

actual cause of KGB concern) is further evi-
dence that NOSENKO did not know the complete
background of the KGB operation, and that his
role was merely that of playing the "Police
Chief".
: NOSENKO's participation in this case con-
tradicts his assertions about the timing of

Purpose of Trip to. Geneva

NOSENKO arrived’ in Genevaon 10 March 1962 listed offi-
cially-.as an "expert" of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Af-
~ fairs: attached to the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament
ys Conference. NOSENKO explained that after GOLITSYN's defec-
..tion in: Finland: [in December 1961] an order was issued that -
“no delegation was to be permitted to depart. the Soviet ‘Union
without -an accompanying KGB security officer. ([NOSENKO has
since stated that he can recall no, such: order.] :

‘Explaining in-1962 how he came to be designated, as the
sectrity-escort, NOSENKO said he argued that he was needed
to direct the fifteen case officers in. his section, but
GRIBANOV. stated that Foreign Minister Gromyko was leading

cer, but a section chief or a deputy chief or’a chief of a

Top Secret

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT — January 1962-January 1964)

In addition to his general security duties with the
delegation, NOSENKO said in 1962 that he was given a
special assignment to check on a senior delegation advisor,
Pavel Fedorovich SHAKHOV (see below) .

During the 1965 interrogations, NOSENKO provided somewhat
varying accounts of the background of his 1962 trip to Geneva.
He said that GRIBANOV had nothing to do with his assignment,
but that [S.G.] BANNIKOV, the Deputy Chief of the Second
Directorate who supervised the Soviet Delegations Abroad
Department,’ made the selection. The latter department was
investigating SHAKHOV, and BANNIKOV was concerned with the
selection of a security officer because SHAKHOV, who was
suspected of being a Western agent, was to be in the delega-
tion. Because of the seriousness attached to the case, the
Delegations Department wanted a chief of section as case
officer, and when a request was made to the Seventh Depart-—
ment Chief, CHELNOKOV, the latter agreed to NOSENKO's as-
signment. NOSENKO stated that CHELNOKOV, his superior and
friend, let him go to Geneva as "a treat", even though he
had just assumed his duties as Chief of the American-—
British Commonwealth Section, he had no deputy,. arid. the trip
was occurring on the eve of the tourist season.

Investigation of SHAKHOV

According to NOSENKO, M.G. SITNIKOV, representing the
Soviet Delegations Department, conducted investigations of
SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but had been unable to resolve the
KGB suspicions about him. Because of the failure of these
early efforts, the KGB decided to send a "senior guy" to the
Disarmament talks in 1962, and NOSENKO was chosen "to finish
things up". Before leaving Moscow in March 1962, NOSENKO
discussed the SHAKHOV case with SITNIKOV and with. LYALIN, the
Soviet Delegations Department. case officer in charge of the
SHAKHOV case. He also read various materials on the case,
including an investigative plan drawn up by LYALIN,

NOSENKO has said that SHAKHOV was under suspicion in 1962
because he was working with different delegations at different
conferences, and there was some evidence that in Geneva ear-

lier he was somehow connected with American diplomat (David MARX

‘and "not wanting: -to work as. an agent".

service he acted as an agent-~recruiter. for the KGB... SHAKHOV
“Was permitted to. travel abroad eventhough suspected of being

SEVENTH DEPARTMENT -- January 1962-January 1964)

Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for
more than a day or two, Legal Rezident S.I. GAVRICHEV would
invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.
GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference,
and shortly after his arrival in Geneva in March 1962,

NOSENKO gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled
members of the Legal Residency. This lecture was given at
GAVRICHEV's request, although it was only after some hesita-
tion on the part of the Legal Rezident that all of his subor-
dinates were brought together to hear NOSENKO. In return

for helping the Legal Residency to perform countersurveillance
on several occasions, NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed
by GAVRICHEV to have the use of an operational car and driver
to go shopping and carry out other private errands. [NOSENKO
was not under CIA surveillance at any time in 1962 in Geneva
and his claims as to his activities there, aside from his
meetings with CIA, can be neither confirmed nor refuted.]

NOSENKO claimed that he would know of any others, and he
was the sole KGB officer within the Soviet Disarmament Dele-
gation in 1962. Among delegates he identified only Oleg
GRINEVSKIY as having any connection with the KGB. GRINEVSKIY
was one of NOSENKO's own agents within the delegation: in
Moscow -he was handled by KGB officers of the Intelligentsia
and Correspondents Department of the Second Chief Directorate.
Among other delegates NOSENKO described A.K. KISLOV and V.G.
FILATOV. According to NOSENKO, KISLOV was head of the Ameri-
can Section of TASS and was “a genuine correspondent"; "de-
finitely not an intelligence officer".

Comment: CIA had tentatively identified all three of
the delegates as KGB officers. ‘KISLOV was ob-
served in apparent KGB operational activity in

at the time.

Association with Other Soviets

According to NOSENKO, the Soviets he saw most often in
Geneva in 1962 were A.K. KISLOV (see above), Yu.I. GUK, and
M.S. TSYMBAL. (Both KISLOV and GUK were involved in the
“ANDREY" case: see p. 33 .)

A.K. KISLOV

TASS correspondent KISLOV was one of the three other -dele-
gates besides NOSENKO staying at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva.
NOSENKO said he arranged for KISLOV's name to.be given as a
notional source of information on Soviet @isarmament policy
to KGB double agent BELITSKIY (see below). NOSENKO drank
and caroused with KISLOV while in Geneva, and KISLOV was
NOSENKO's companion in early June, when NOSENKO either
squandered or was robbed of KGB operatdonal funds. [the loss
he asked CIA to make good], and on the night of 10 June, when
he squandered the 2000 Swiss francs CIA provided on wine and
women. With reference to the threat posed his security by
KISLOV's knowledge of his profligacy, NOSENKO said that KISLOV

was “too drunk to know what was going on", and in any event

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that KISLOV
had been a KGB operational contact while stationed in the
United States and that NOSENKO had been introduced to KISLOV
by a KGB officer in Moscow prior to departing for Geneva in
1962, so that he. could use KISLOV at the conference. On the
basis of NOSENKO's favorable xeport afterwards, he said,
KISLOV had been recruited as a KGB agent on his return.

In 1966 NOSENKO named the Soviets living with him at the
Ariane Hotel in 1962, but did not name KISLOV.

Implying that their’ friendship was of long standing;
NOSENKO related in 1962 that he and GUK were together near'ty
every day in Geneva, where they ‘went out’ to; chat’ and. have e@
few drinks. As a consequence, NOSENKO. was ‘granted access to
the residency and was ablé to elicit information about some
of GUK's operations in Geneva. He described his “big. big

only “strong officer" in-the residency.

ee RE (SEE EESO) Female Secretary

NOSENKO has described his association with a[British]
secretary whom he met at a diplomatic reception in Geneva as

.one of an amorous pursuit: he disclaimed any Operational

interest in the girl. After several dates, NOSENKO could no
longer reach her at her apartment, and he concluded that she
had told her superiors that he was a Russian and had pro-
bably believe@ him to be an intelligence officer.

“learned of the case through his friendship with the chief
ofthe Second ("Active Line") Section of the American Depart+
ment, V.I; PETROV. BELITSKIY was.a KGB agent whom American
Intelligence had’ recruited in’ London: he'had never been met.
by the Americans in the ‘Soviet Union. NOSENKO did not, know
the’ date of recruitment but knew the case was, already in pro=
gress during his second ‘assignment with the Embassy Section °
(January, 1960-January 1962). -BELITSKIY had been a KGB agent
fora’ “long, long". time and was a KGB agent when he first
went abroad’ (prior to his’ recruitment by American Intelli-
gence). : Sires :

The KGB's purpose: in running. the BELITSKIY operation ‘was
to lure’ American: Intelligence -into meeting the agent inside
“sthe Soviet Union;.to learn: the channels and means through
which American Intelligence communicated with agents inside
the Soviet Union. This was the "most important task" of the
Second Chief Directorate. | Although BELITSKIY, in meeting
with his American’ case officers, continually pleaded fear of
“contacts with American Intelligence in’Moscow, this wes a
ruse; the real. KGB-intent was to use. BELITSKIY: to lure Ameri-
tan Intelligence into contacting him.in the Soviet Union.
After. BELITSKIY was recruited in London, CIA "did not go on

. with him... didn't: hold any meetings with him". . Nevertheless,

he. said, the KGB’ "cherished. the hope...to lead him in some-
~what deeper", The KGB-First Chief Directorate, with its own
responsibilities ‘and objectives, was unaware of Second Chief.

Directorate objectives in the BELITSKIY case. The First
Chief Directorate,”through Department. D,”"provided dezinformat-
siya’ [disinformation] ‘at the Second: Chief Directorate's re-
quest, but in this case,.as in other “games",-it.did not know
for what ultimate purpose: the disinformation would be used.
(In such ‘cases I.I.AGAYANTS, Chief. of Department D, did not
even know, in what country the disinformation was to be used,
let alone the identity of the agent.)

NOSENKO. did not actively participate in the case until he
received in Geneva a cable from Moscow directing him to give
advice to the young and inexperienced case officer V.L. ARTE-
MOV. ARTEMOV had not worked on the BELITSKIY case in Moscow
either; he also had been sent to Geneva to work on counter—
intelligence matters and only to direct BELITSKIY df the Ameri-
cans should.contact the agent. BELITSKIY had been “inserted"
in a World Health Organization Delegation in the hope that CIA
would "find him".

As a result of that KGB instruction, NOSENKO jcined with
ARTEMOV in directing BELITSKIY's meetings with the latter's
American case officers. BELITSKIY was first met™in Geneva by
the American case officer "Bob", and later by "Henry", who
was “called out from the States". BELITSKIY noted that the
name on the door of the apartment where he met his American
case officers was not the same as that of the person whose
apartment it was alleged to be, and that the apartment itself
had an "un-lived-in" look.

When the American case officers asked BELITSKIY whether he
could establish contact with a Russian on the Disarmament
Delegation, NOSENKO advised ARTEMOV not to use anyone from
the Soviet Foreign Ministry. NOSENKO proposed instead that
BELITSKIY claim to get information from the head of the
American Department of TASS, A.K. KISLOV. The information,
of course, would be (disinformation) furnished by the KGB.

In case the Americans would check, NOSENKO and ARTEMOV ar-
ranged for BELITSKIY to be introduced to KISLOV.

The KGB believed that CIA had accepted BELITSKIY's bona
fides. From the. KGB viewpoint, however, while BELITSKIY was
jot a bad agent, he was apt to go too far sometimes, and “add
things on his own". For this reason, the KGB limited BELIT-
SKIY's time spent with CIA, to lessen the chance that the
agent might say something which would cause CIA to sense that
he was a plant.

Comment: NOSENKO's information ‘about the BELITSKIY-CIA
relationship is substantially correct, except
‘for some inaccuracies about the origin of the
‘case. BELITSKIY, a commentator. for Radio. Mos-
cow, as NOSENKO described, in Geneva did. meet
ke CIA.officers using the aliases "Bob" and “Henry"

NOSENKO's version of his role in the case,
however, is implausible. “He asserts that BELIT-
SKIY, a prominent Russian with acquaintances
among influential officials of the Soviet Govern-
ment, an. agent ostensibly. under-the control of
CIA for several years, was sent by the KGB to
Geneva. to resumé contact with CIA. The KGB, ac-
cording to NOSENKO, sent neither the responsible
case officer nor an officer of the KGB section
responsible for the operation.. NOSENKO states
that the KGB instead detailed a “young and in-
experienced" KGB officer who happened to be in
Geneva at. the time, an officer who had no prior
connection with the BELITSKIY. case nor. even;
knowledge.of operating conditions in Geneva.
NOSENKO further states that the KGB then instruc-

involvement with American tourist agents in
1958 and 1959, during a period when NOSENKO
claims to have been Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department's American Section.

Under interrogation NOSENKO did not know
how, when, or where the BELITSKIY operation
started, did not know the nature of Caeoul
involvement, did not know the operational lad
tails and contact arrangements BELITSKIY had
with CIA, did not know BELITSKIY's pattern of
activity in Moscow or in Geneva, and did not
know the alleged objective of the KGB opera-
tion, e.g., the substance of the "disinformation"
which BELITSKIY was to provide CIA.

From the foregoing it is concluded that
NOSENKO did not exercise any supervisory func-
tion in the BELITSKIY case.

Contact with CIA
naan Arar aanTa OS

On 5 June 1962 U.S. Foreign Service Officer Davia MARK)
reported to CIA in Geneva that he had been approached by a
Soviet citizen whom he believed to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO,
a member of the Soviet Disarmament Delegation. NOSENKO had
merely suggested that they get together for a talk on the
following day.. In late afternoon on 6 June, NOSENKO told

(WRX) privately that he would like to talk to (MaRR] as soon as Vt

possible. He was "not going to pump him for information", but
“simply wanted to tell him some things". A luncheon meeting
was arranged for 9 June, although NOSENO indicated that he
preferred an éarlier date.l¢ MARK] advised CIA of: the appoint-
ment and commented that the approach seemed so unusual that
it might be an offer of cooperation or defection.

self as a counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensure
the security of the Soviet delegation. He knew that MARK) had pL
previously served in Moscow and {erroneously] believed him to

be an American intelligence officer. NOSENKO said he needed

approximately 900 Swiss francs immediately to cover KGB opera-
tional funds which he had squandered on liquor and a prosti-

tute in Geneva, and offered for this amount to sell two items
of’ information to American Intelligence. The first item was”
the identity ofan American, a former employee of the Embassy
in Moscow, who'was a KGB agent "near ciphers" in the Washing-

‘ton area. The second item was. the identity of a Soviet. citi-

zen. in Moscow who, although ostensibly a CIA agent, had been
planted on CIA. by the KGB. Although NOSENKO proposed a one-
ti transaction, he acknowledged to[MARK] that he might. be
unable to avoid déeper. involvement with American Intelligence.

‘'[MARK\introduced, NOSENKO to a CIA officer the evening of
9 June “and NOSENKO was taken to the first of five lengthy
meetings held in a CIA safehouse. At the initial meeting
NOSENKO described himself as a. KGB major experienced in opera-

» tions against the American.Embassy. in Moscow. and against

American.tourists and other travellers to the Soviet Union.
He. told of his financial difficulties and repeated his offer
to sell the.two specified items of information... He said that
the need for money was his immediate motive for contacting
CIA, although in.the ensuing discussion he asserted also that
he was dissatisfied with the Communist regime in. the Soviet
Union... NOSENKO emphasized that he: had no intention of be-
coming an American agent and that ‘after his proposed trans-

. action, he would have no further contact with CIA. . Despite

this ‘assertion, after describing the cases of ‘"ANDREY"

(Dayle SMITH, see p. 33.) and the KGB double agent BELITSKIY
(see p. 282), NOSENKO supplied considerable biographic infor-
mation about himself and also discussed in general terms cer-
tain additional’ KGB operations ‘as well as KGB. organization
and operational’ methods in Moscow. He understood, as he had
told (HARK) <ar lier, that CIA would want more information, and

audio surveillance operation against the Embassy in Moscow.
Among foreign agents of the KGB NOSENKO identified Canadian
Ambassador WATKINS ‘see p. 23 ) and described a British Ad-
miralty employee (William VASSALL, see p. 30 ). He talked
freely of his activities in Geneva, including his association
with KGB officers there, his visits to the KGB residency
and his security duties with respect to the Soviet delega-
tion. NOSENKO seemed to CIA to be what he claimed: a KGB
officer with personal knowledge of important and sensitive
KGB operations. ‘He described his education, his service in
the Naval GRU, his entry into the KGB and the general func-
tions and operating techniques of the various components of
the Second Chief Directorate in which he had served, along
with the approximate dates of his service.

Ultimately the only restriction which NOSENKO placed on
his cooperation with CIA was his refusal to permit communica-—
tion with him in the Soviet Union. He was willing to meet
with CIA representatives during future trips outside the
Soviet Union, which he estimated would occur about once every other

i year. He said he would not consider defecting except in cir-
f cumstances in which his personal security was endangered,
: citing as reasons his devotion to his wife and children (and
voce fl | fear of KGB reprisal against them if he fled), his widowed
mother's dependence on him, and his love of Russia:.and the
Russian people.

NOSENKO promised to contact CIA and arrangements were
-made for him to do so, when he came to the West again.
Meanwhile, he expressed the intention to do everything within
limits imposed by concern for his own security to obtain in-
formation which he was informed was of interest to CIA.

i Summary and Conclusion

According to NOSENKO, he requested transfer to the Seventh
Department to avoid being named Deputy Chief of the American
Department over his then-superior, the experienced and highly
successful KGB officer KOVSHUK. He is adamant that the trans-
fer took place "before [the defection of] GOLITSYN", which he
asserts occured in mid-January 1962. Among his other functions
in the Seventh Department, he.cites directing five agents
whom. he brought from the American Department. In his initial
capacity as Chief of the American Section, NOSENKO claims in-
volvement only in the WE. JOHNSON | case, his time being spent 06
either in "reading in" on his new job or preparing for his
initial trip to Geneva. He alleges that he was directed to
accompany the Soviet delegation to Geneva for an extended
period, in behalf of another Second Directorate Department,
over his objections, when he had no deputy to assume his func-
tions in his absence, and on the eve of the tourist season.

First Deputy Chief, and thus second-in-command to CHELNOKOV
and general supervisor of all Second Chief Directorate tourist
operations. The Seventh Department, which had a strength of
about. 100 KGB officers, was responsible for all operations
against tourists in the Soviet Union. From this period NOSENKO
claimed to have learned, either by virtue of his position as
Deputy Chief of otherwise, of a number of KGB operations
against Americans, including two arrests, one recruitment, and
investigations of a suspected FBI agent and of Lee Harvey
OSWALD. NOSENKO as well attributes to his senior KGB posi-

Section officer, the latter occurring just before NOSENKO re-
turned to Geneva for the second time, and defected.

Arrest of BARGHOORN

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO
described the provocation and arrest of Yale University
Professor Frederick BARGHOORN in late 1963. NOSENKO's
most comprehensive statement, from which the following
Paragraphs were largely drawn, was made on 9 June 1964,
NOSENKO said that the Purpose of the KGB operation
against BARGHOORN was to retaliate for persona non grata
action taken against three Soviets in New York City in
the case of John W. BUTENKO {in November 1963] and to
secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet (Igor
IVANOV) in the BUTENKO case who Was jailed. (NOSENKO
had asserted in Geneva, earlier, that the operation
against BARGHOORN "was to discourage future arrests
such as that of IVANOV, not because of any special im-
portance of IVANOV himself.")

NOSENKO's Information

In 1963 four KGB First Chief Directorate officers
assigned to the New York Legal Residency were caught in
operational activity in the United States. Of the four,
three had diplomatic immunity, but one was a chauffeur
and had only. a service passport. The three Soviet
diplomats were held three or four hours by the American
authorities and then released. IVANOV, the chauffeur,
was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity.
GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,
learned of this arrest probably the next day and was
directed’ by KGB. Chairman Semichastnyy to take “necessary
measures." GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office
NOSENKO; A.G. KOVALENKO, Chief of the Seventh Department;
and G.I. GRYAZNOV and Ye. M. RASHCHEPOV from the
American. Department. After describing the arrest,
GRIBANOV asked what information the Second Chief
Directorate Departments had on any American, Embassy
employee or tourist, that could serve as the victim of
an [retaliatory] arrest. RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV said
that at that very moment there were three or four
American Service Attaches in Rostov and that, in the
opinion of the American Department, these officers might
be carrying electronic apparatus. It was known that they
had cameras, that they had been taking photographs, and
they had been-observed taking notes, They could be
arrested in Rostov before they took the return Plane to

Moscow. 298

GRIBANOV instructed the two representatives. of the
American Department to write a report on what other
possibilities existed. He also told. them to request
permission | to. arrest and search ‘the Service Attaches.

GRIBANOV. ‘then asked what. pertinent information was
held by the Sevengh Department. He was told that there
were relatively few. American tourists in:the Soviet.
‘Union at.that time. These included BARGHOORN, who was
mentioned ‘to GRIBANOV:,along. with one other (name not’
recalled). “NOSENKO. and KOVALENKO reported, however,
‘that the KGB had no. "strong" materials ‘to use against

“them. They were ordered to make .an immediate. study of
the situation and.to report back to GRIBANOV as soon
as possible. :

KOVALENKO gathered the entire’ Américan Tourist Section

(SEVENTH DEPARTHENT - January 1962-January 1964)

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving
"materials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow. NOSENKO said that
this would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that
this made no difference. He instructed NOSENKO and
KOVALENKO to locate an agent who could be used to pass
the compromi’sing material to BARGHOORN and told them
to write a summary of BARGHOORN's background with a
proposal that the Second Chief Directorate arrest him
‘when he obtains materials which are of interest to
american Intelligence." This was to be sent in letter
form to Semichastnyy over GRIBANOV's signature; the
letter was not to indicate how BARGHOORN was to receive
the materials. (That the evidence was to be planted
was not to be mentioned.)

GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOORN, along
with a similar letter from GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV
concerning the Service Attaches, to Semichastnyy. While
the four -~ NOSENKO,. KOVALENKO, GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV ~~
were waiting in GRIBANOV.'s office for his return,
GRYAZNOV received a telephone call from the Rostov KGB
organization informing. him that the Service Attaches
were in the air on their. way back to Moscow. Shortly
thereafter, GRIBANOV returned with the news that the
Chairman of the KGB had approved the arrests of the
Service Attaches as well as BARGHOORN. Khrushchev was
absent. from Moscow at the time, but Semichastnyy had
called BREZHNEV and secured his approval.

When. GRIBANOV. learned from GRYAZNOV that the Service
Attaches were already. on their way back to Moscow, he
became furious and.sent. GRYAZNOV out "to do the job or
die." Meanwhile, arrangements were made with the
"Department D" (the KGB element responsible for .dis-
information, subordinate. to the First Chief Directorate)
to provide materials on missiles which could be passed
to BARGHOORN. While these were being picked up, NOSENKO
and KOVALENKO returned to their office to plan the arrest.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance
upon his arrival in Moscow. At 1810 hours a radio
message was received from one of the surveillance cars
that BARGHOORN had gone to the American Embassy, and it
was decided that the agent (name not recalled, aged 25
to 30 years) would be placed in contact with him as soon
as he came_out. The KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appoint-
ment with ORCHARD of the British Embassy| at 1900 hours 0421

the missile documents.) The first sessions
concentrated on general matters, such as
BARGHOORN's life history.

After one and one half hours of questioning
BARGHOORN agreed that the materials were on him
when he was arrested, but he maintained that they had
been placed on his person. He said that he thought
they were “newspapers or something," that he did not
know what they were. The package was then opened and
shown to BARGHOORN; it contained about 20 to 25 pages
of information on missiles. "BARGHOORN was not, of
course, given a close look" at the materials.

Following BARGHOORN's admission, another declaration
was drawn up by KRUPNOV and signed by KRUPNOV,
KOVALENKO, and GRIBANOV. NOSENKO and KRUPNOV then
took it to the office of the Chief Prosecutor where
the incident report, the first interrogation, and
the first and second declarations were reported to
MISHUTIN, the First Deputy Chief Prosecutor. .GRIBANOV
directed that all materials on BARGHOORN, including
information from KGB Archives, be given to the KGB
Department of Prosecution so that they could begin
legal proceedings against BARGHOORN. After this, all
interrogations were conducted by that department;
KRUPNOV was dropped from the case, although YEFREMOV.
continued to act as interpreter.

Comment:  BARGHOORN’s version of his, entrapment,
arrest, and interrogation coincide fairly
precisely. with. the version provided by
NOSENKO. He identified NOSENKO from a
photograph as a KGB officer present at
one stage of the interrogation on the
second day of his arrest and said
NOSENKO took some part in the pro-
ceedings. He recalled NOSENKO as being
“clever and quick~witted" and as “giving
the impression that he was not a dedicated
careerist, but opportunistic and adaptive:
he seemed not to care about what he was
doing, but doing a good job nevertheless."

“The OSWALD CASE -

-NOSENKO'S “knowledge of the KGB's interest in
OSWALD stemmed from his ‘claimed Tourist Department
assignments.'.He asserted that while Deputy Chief
of the American Section in-1959 he participated in

“the KGB determination that OSWALD was of no operational
interest. In September 1963, when NOSENKO was: Deputy

. Chief of. the Tourist Department, he was informed of
OSWALD'S visit to the’ Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to
apply ‘to return.to the USSR... Immediately following
President. Kennedy's. assassination, NOSENKO, as

Deputy Chief of the Tourist. Department, reviewed KGB
records of OSWALD's stay: in the Soviet: Union including

pthe Second..Chief. Diréctorate file on OSWALD.

completely unknown to. the KGB: Moreover, upon -
‘receipt of. his visa-application, .the ‘KGB’ Second Chief.
Directorate determined. that he was: not of sufficient
importance to.justify any special interest by the

: Seventh Department. Not until about October 1959,
when OSWALD expressed a-desire to remain in the USSR
did he come to the attention of 'NOSENKO, who was, at

. that time, Deputy Chief of .the American Section of
the. Seventh Department. .All available materials. on

’ Top Secret

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT -- January 1962-January 1964)

Although the KGB considered it possible that OSWALD

might be an American agent, the KGB did nothing to
investigate this possibility because “this would be

done after the person is allowed to stay in the Soviet
Union." Surveillance of OSWALD was not increased after
his request, and OSWALD was not interviewed by the KGB

in an attempt to establish his intentions. KRUPNOV

sent NOSENKO, his chief, a memorandum on information

which had been received concerning OSWALD. The memorandum
cited reports by KGB informants at the Hotel Berlin, where
OSWALD was staying in accordance with an Inturist itinerary
and a two-page report by the Inturist interpreter to whom
OSWALD made his initial request to remain in the Soviet
Union. A file incorporating all information which KRUPNOV
had collected was thereupon opened in NOSENKO's section.

From this information NOSENKO and KRUPNOV concluded
that OSWALD was of no interest to the KGB, and both agreed
that OSWALD appeared somewhat "abnormal." For this reason
NOSENKO. instructed KRUPNOV to advise OSWALD through the
Inturist interpreter that he would not.be permitted to
remain pexmanently in the USSR and that he must depart on
the expiration of his visa, then seek re-entry. as a’
permanent resident. through. normal channels. at the Soviet
Embassy in Washington. KRUPNOV followed NOSENKO.'s orders,
and either ‘that day or thé next NOSENKO learned that OSWALD

“failed to appear for a scheduled tour. arranged by his

Inturist guide. This prompted a search, and.after several
hours, OSWALD was found in his hotel room, bleeding heavily
from self-inflicted wounds. After hearing of this incident
from KRUPNOV, NOSENKO then reported it to K.N. DUBAS, Chief
of the Seventh Department. NOSENKO believed that DUBAS in
turn reported it to GRIBANOV, head of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate. GRIBANOV upheld NOSENKO's. original decision
that the KGB.should not become involved with. OSWALD and
that OSWALD should not be permitted to remain in the USSR.

There was no attempt to. debrief OSWALD because "he was
not an interesting person and wasn't normal." OSWALD was
never questioned on his past nor asked to write an  auto-
biography.

NOSENKO did not know who eventually granted
OSWALD permission to reside temporarily in the. USSR
or who approved issuance of his temporary residence permit.
The KGB gave instructions that he not be allowed to live
-in the Moscow. area. Either. the Soviet Red Cross or the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs may have made this decision
to assign OSWALD to Minsk. | The Seventh Department updated
his file, and it. was sent,. along with a cover letter pre-
pared by KRUPNOV, to the local KGB organization in Minsk.”
KRUPNOV's letter summarized the case and specifically in-
-.Structed local authorities there to take no action. con-
cerning OSWALD ‘except to observe his activities “passively"
_to make sure that he was: not an “American Intelligence agent
on temporary "sleeper" status. NOSENKO read this letter,
--and it.was signed by DUBAS... On the basis of the instructions
contained in. the letter, NOSENKO said, no active steps could
be taken in Minsk..without.-KGB Headquarters approval.: It -was
“NOSENKO's opinion that. the only coverage of OSWALD during
his stay in Minsk consisted of periodic checks at -his
.Place of employment, .questioning. of his neighbors and
associates, .and coverage of his ‘mail. After, OSWALD's
-threatened second suicide attempt, the KGB “washed its
hands of him" and that even ‘though there was considered
to be some possibility. that he was a "sleeper agent,"

quiry to Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV or to KOVALENKO.

NOSENKO thought he himself was present at the time. ALEKSEYEV
was given OSWALD's background, including his suicide attempt
and the fact that he was not considered normal, and was

told to advise the First Chief Directorate that OSWALD should
not be permitted to return to the Soviet Union. ALEKSEYEV
relayed this information to the First Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD had spoken at the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and he knew of no contacts
between OSWALD and Cubans or representatives of the Cuban
Government there or elsewhere,

Comment: Independent sources, however, reported on
visits by OSWALD to the Cuban. as well as
Soviet Embassies in Mexico City between 29
September. and 3. October 1963 and on his
(apparently overt) contact with a KGB officer
under Consular cover at the Soviet Embassy
there. .NOSENKO originally said he knew
nothing of, any such contact. In October 1966
he ‘revised this to say that OSWALD did not
have contact with the KGB in Mexico City.
NOSENKO explained that he had been sitting in
the office of Seventh Department Chief, K.N.
DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-
quarters from the KGB Legal Residency in
Mexico. The cable, which NOSENKO said he did
not personally see, reported that OSWALD had
visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City

Post~Assassination. Review of KGB File na

NOSENKO next:.learned. of OSWALD's:activities as a result
of President Kennedy's assassination. About two-hours after
President Kennedy was shot, NOSENKO was advised of this..fact
in a telephone -call.to his home from.KGB Headquarters. A
short while later he was told, again by telephone, that the
President had died. : About two hours later, NOSENKO was told
that OSWALD had. been arrésted, and he and the other ‘officers
of the American Tourist Section were called in to determine
whether the KGB had any information. concerning him. After
establishing’ OSWALD 's identity from"KGB’files and learning
that his file was still in Minsk, NOSENKO ‘phoned the-KGB
office in Minsk,on-GRIBANOV's orders.” The’ local KGB’ dictated

over the telephone a summary of its file on OSWALD. .This

summary. concluded with the statement that the KGB in Minsk
had attempted "to influence OSWALD in the. right direction".
GRIBANOV..had been greatly disturbed: about the local: KGB's
efforts because it had been .given specific -instructions to
carry out nothing other than passive. measures against OSWALD
there. He ordered” that. all records: in Minsk pertaining to
OSWALD 's ‘stay. theré; as well as an explanation of the

meaning..of the statement about influencing OSWALD, be -flown

immediately. to Moscow by military aircraft... NOSENKO personally
read the explanation from Minsk concerning’ the meaning of
this .statement and thoroughly reviewed. OSWALD's file when

wt’ arrived by:plane....Hé ‘then turned the file over to S.M.

FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the American Department of the KGB
Second Chief Directorate, ‘who prepared a two-page summary

“, memorandum for GRIBANOV.... This memorandum, which NOSENKO
‘read, was forwarded to KGB. Chairman Semichastnyy, and

Semichastnyy in turn. reported to the. CPSU Central Committee
and to Khrushchev concerning it.

OSWALD's'-file from.Minsk contained.no information to
indicate that the KGB in’Minsk had ‘taken any action with
respect. to OSWALD contrary to instructions from KGB Head~
quarters. From the date of OSWALD's arrival in the USSR
until his departure, the KGB had no personal contact with
him and had not attempted to’utilize him in any manner.

OSWALD never received any KGB training or KGB assign~
ments. If any other department of the KGB or the GRU had
wanted to use OSWALD in any way, it would have had to secure
permission from the Seventh Department, which originally
opened his case file. In view of OS"MIALD's apparent mental
instability, no Sdéviet intelligence organization, particu-
larly not the Thirteenth (Assassination and Sabotage)
Department, would have considered using him. KGB Head-
quarters did not maintain a control file on him following
his settlement in Minsk, as it would have done had OSWALD
been of any operational interest. The only KGB record on
OSWALD maintained in Moscow was an index card giving his
name and the fact the Seventh Department had originated a
file concerning him.

The KGB maintained no separate file on Marina OSWALD;
E all information about her was kept in OSWALD's file. There
| was no indication in OSWALD's file that the KGB had had any
rc interest in Marina either while she was in the Soviet Union
or after she left for the United States.

Comment: NOSENKO later told CIA on one occasion that he
“only skimmed the file" and on another that he
had it in his possession about 20 minutes. In
October 1966 he again said that he read the
file and that while doing so he saw a picture
of OSWALD for the first time. NOSENKO added
that he never met OSWALD personally.

NOSENKO's assertion that the KGB First Chief
Directorate first learned of OSWALD when he
applied for a re-entry visa in Mexico City in
September 1963 is probably incorrect. The
consular file turned over to the U.S. Govern-
ment by the Soviet Embassy in Washington
after the assassination indicated that the KGB
First Chief Directorate would have known of
OSWALD as early as February 1963 if not earlier.
That file contained Marina OSWALD's letter of
February 1963 and a letter of July 1963 from
OSWALD, both of which indicated that OSWALD had

At his first meeting with CIA in January 1964 NOSENKO
related how a disaffected former KGB colleague, A.N.
CHEREPANOV, had stolen documents from the American Embassy
Section and in November 1963 sent them through an inter-
mediary to the American Embassy. CHEREPANOV's treason was
discovered, NOSENKO said, when the Embassy returned the
documents to Soviet authorities. CHEREPANOV fled Moscow,
and NOSENKO claimed to have taken part in the KGB search
for him. “NOSENKO brought with him to Geneva the official
KGB document which authorized his travel in the search for
CHEREPANOV.

The significance of the CIIEREPANOV incident is twofold.
The KGB documents which CHEREPANOV allegedly sent to the
Embassy appear to have originated in the American Depart~
ment's Embassy Section, and the documents relate to KGB
modus operandi, personnel, targets, and technical devices
employed in operations during 1958-1960, during part of
which time NOSENKO claimed he was Deputy Chief of the
Embassy Section. The KGB document, the “temporary duty
authorization", is an item of physical evidence NOSENKO
has offered to substantiate his claim to personal parti-
cipation in the CHEREPANOV case and to having held the rank
of KGB lieutenant colonel. [The document does not itself
refer to CHEREPANOV in any manner. ]

NOSENKO's Information

The KGB officer, A.N. CHEREPANOV was born about 1920 or
1921, During World War II he was a KGB officer working
with partisan groups behind the lines, Later he was in
Yugoslavia for four or. five years, and was probably Deputy
Chief of the KGB Legal Residency in Belgrade.

Comment: CIA records contain references to an Aleksandar -
Nikolayevich CHEREPANOV, a Soviet diplomat and
suspected intelligence officer in Belgrade in
1953. CHEREPANOV left Belgrade in 1956. A
Yugoslav intelligence officer who defected in
1957 confirmed that CHEREPANOV had been an
intelligence officer.

_ When CHEREPANOV. returned to Moscow, he had: some (unspecified)
problem getting a job, but finally the KGB Second Chief
Directorate took him into the American Embassy Section of the
American Department, working against. State Department

. personnel. in the Administrative Section of the Embassy. ‘He |
5 worked in the same room.as.V.A. KUSKOV, and-was case officer
i for three: KGB targets:-. Richard SNYDER. and John McVICKAR,
counstilar officers, and {Mario ALBAMONTR,. secretary to. thelé
. Kpersonned officer. CHEREPANOV's work as a case officer was
q poor, and as it: grew.worse, the KGB decided: to’ retire him...
a Because .of his. service in World ‘War II, for which he :
received three ‘years' pension credit for each year of military
.sérvice, he had enough time to his credit to be eligible for
retirement... Also, he was just over the minimum age (40) for
retirement’ from the KGB. ..: 7 : :

and angry iat the KGB, he became even more dissatisfied when

Prior to leaving the KGB; CHEREPANOV. had ‘stolen draft
copies of ‘documents he had handled in. the Embassy Section.
In one _case,.he copied.the contents of a report’ in his own
handwriting, evidently having been unable to steal the
‘document itself. . All ofthe documents ‘he had’ stolen were

’ dnténded ‘for destruction. :

- “a. catastrophe": in the KGB. GUK.said he had the story from

the. CHEREPANOV papers were. brought there, after their delivery
by Thomas FAIN of the Embassy. MAKASHEV saw the name of

papers and saw that. one: of ‘them was a plan. for: agent opera~
tions against an American. He noted that. one of the. documents
was-at least an.inch thick. Gromyko immediately called KGB
Chairman Semichastnvy, who notified GRIBANOV.  ‘GRIBANOV's->

When the American Embassy saw the CHEREPANOV documents,
they were afraid that the documents were part of a KGB
provocation, and they wondered what the Russians were
trying to do. The Embassy officials photographed the
documents and on the next day returned them to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. When the Americans gave the documents
to the Ministry,.the KGB wondered why the Americans gave
them back.

The whole matter was held very tightly in the KGB during
its investigation for 20 or 25 days. When the KGB examined
the documents, some were found to be in CHEREPANOV's hand-
writing, but no documents were found which pertained to
CHEREPANOV's own case work, or that of the American Embassy
Section. The KGB found no documents dated later than
1961--none for 1962 or 1963-~only 1959, 1960 and 1961. Thus
there were a number of indications pointing towards
CHEREPANOV, who had left the section in 1961. The KGB did
not dare alert him by putting full-time surveillance on him,
but instead mounted fixed surveillance posts at his home and
office. In order to provoke CHEREPANOV into some precipitous
action, a former KGB colleague was sent to visit him who, in
the course of. conversation, mentioned the great disturbance
in the KGB caused by someone passing stolen KGB documents
to the Americans. CHEREPANOV manifested no reaction to the
newsand was’ quite cool about the matter. The next day the
surveillance post observed. him leaving his house in the
morning at his usual time, apparently on his way to work,
but the surveillance post at his office soon reported that
he had not arrived at work. He had "simply dropped out of
sight".

An intensive search “all over the city of Moscow" ensued,
then spread throughout the Soviet Union: Border controls.
were tightened, photographs of CHEREPANOV were sent out to
Republic.and local.KGB and militia offices, and all.means
of transport were covered. Reports began coming in from
various places that someone who seemed to fit CHEREPANOV's
description had been seen acting suspiciously here and there.
Reports which came into KGB Headquarters from Gorkiy Oblast
strongly indicated the possibility of CHEREPANOV's presence
there, so NOSENKO was dispatched to the area to check.

NOSENKO went: to Gorkiy on the fourth: day after CHFRE-
PANOV's. disappearance. The area.was covered with very deep
woods, “where a person could low himsélf for life". - On the

.séventh day CHEREPANOV was located and arrested in Baku,

where he was onvhis bed to the Iranian border.

’ A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, carrying
‘S.M. FEDOSEYEV and several other American. Department: of fi-
cers. They brought CHEREPANOV immediately back to Moscow,
interrogating him on the plane. ; He immediately confessed
to having given the documents to the Americans. When asked
why, he said he was “angry at the KGB, very angry", and
besides, he thought he might ask the Americans for’ some’
money in ‘return” for the documents. He confessed that on
4 November he had passed the documents ‘to’ ‘an American tourist.
who was a ‘librarian interested in Russian books..He said he»
had given the. documents ‘to the American in the entrance
hallway in.the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,”
the building in which the:Ministry of .Foreign Trade was also
housed. :

*<Because CHEREPANOV had eluded the’ KGB between the’ two
fixed surveillance. posts which had beén established, “the
Second Chief Directorate suffered considerable. criticism
for not putting, CHEREPANOV under full, .round-the-clock ©. :."

written. to the government and -newSpapers, a jetter of protest
against “such an indignity, such persecution", and then.”
would have committed suicide, leaving. the: KGB “without PrOOE
of his guilt. ;

Contents of the CHERFPANOV Package

The KGB documents in the CHEREPANOV package totalled
103 pages in the original Russian version, divided almost
‘equally between typewritten reports in final form and hand-
written draft reports or notes, plus two copies of letters
written by Soviet citizens to the American Embassy. The
longest single document was a 33-page Top Secret report,
dated 18 April 1959, entitled "Operational Conditions in
the U.S.A. and the Activities of American Counterinteiligence
Organs against Soviet Installations and Soviet Citizens in
the U.S.A. in 1957-1958". The report was signed by Colonel
A. FEKLISOV, [alias FOMIN, the former KGB rezident in
Washington]. whose title is given as "Chief, Pirst [American]
Department, First Chief Directorate". The rest of the
documents refer to KGB coverage of various American Embassy
and American diplomats in Moscow during the period August
1958 to 15 October 1960. Most of the documents were prepared
by or for one senior case officer of the Embassy Section,
First Department, Second Chief Directorate, Major V. KUSKOV.
(NOSENKO has identified V.A. KUSKOV as an officer of the
Second Chief Directorate who shared an office with CHEREPANOV
from about 1958 to 1961.) Two reports were on Americans who
had left the Soviet Union, Edward L. KILLHAM, Second Secretary
from July 1957 to July 1959, and Wallace L. LITTELL, Attache
from June 1956 to July 1958. There were operational plans
for agent work against four American diplomats once stationed
in Moscow, Richard HARMSTONE, Lewis W. BOWDEN, James A.
RAMSEY, and George WINTERS. Other documents’ included were
an agent's report of her relationship with WINTERS, a summary
of LANGELLE's activities while in the USSR, a list of Soviet
citizens whose letters to the Embassy had been intercepted
by the KGB, a handwritten: summary {signed by CHEREPANOV), of
derogatory information on a Soviet youth who had been in
touch with American: Consul Richard SNYDER, and various hand-
written drafts and notes on the foregoing Americans.

| . The operational. plan on WINTERS, as an example, indicated
-. that WINTERS had’ already been identified as an intelligence
officer, and to ascertain the nature of his intelligence
activities, the KGB was to employ round-the-clock surveil-
lance, technical aids metka and "“NEPTUNE-80", audio surveil-
dance, and investigation of his‘ contacts among Soviet.
citizens. The plan “reflected that while the KGB judgment
was ‘that. WINTERS ."had-a hostile-attitude toward the USSR"
and that there “was no basis for recruitment", care should
be*taken not to alarm him and cause him to leave the country
prematurely,'‘since there still might. arise an opportunity
to attempt to recruit ‘him. :

Comment: NOSENKO has never provided a satisfactory
explanation for his retention of the document
nor for bringing it to Geneva. According to
an earlier KGB defector, the bearer of a
temporary duty authorization is held strictly
accountable for the document which has to be
turned in with the financial voucher. What-
ever NOSENKO's purpose, the effect of presenting
the document to CIA was to corroborate his
statements about CHEREPANOV and substantiate
his claim that he was a KGB lieutenant colonel.
NOSENKO was not a lieutenant colonel (see p.350).
When he eventually said in 1966 that he was
only a captain, NOSENKO was challenged to
explain how he came to possess an official KGB
document signed by General GRIBANOV and
identifying him as a lieutenant colonel.

NOSENKO asserted that it came about "by mistake".

Return to Geneva (January-February 1964)

NOSENKO was detailed a second time to perform security
escort duties with the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament
Conference, and he returned to Geneva in January 1964 where
he resumed contact with CIA and announced his intention to
defect. He brought with him a considerable number of hand-
written notes to which he referred when describing to CIA
officers KGB. operations of which he claimed he learned at
KGB Headquarters during 1962 and-1963. His delegation
security duties. were not onerous. He visited the Geneva
Legal Residency daily and met with CIA almost as frequently
while awaiting approval of his defection and exfiltration
from Switzerland, tentatively scheduled for some three
weeks later. -A little. more than a week after his arrival,
however, NOSENKO declared that he had to defect at once,
because he had received cabled instructions to return to the
USSR immediately. On 4 February 1964 NOSENKO was taken from
Switzerland to Germany, and on 12 February he was brought
to the United States.

Purpose of Geneva Trip

NOSENKO explained that it was his personal wish that
had brought him to’Geneva, that he was allowed to travel as
"a treat" when it appeared to be the last occasion he might
have to travel to the West. [NOSENKO said in 1962 that when
he became Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, as he
expected to become, he would travel to the West every two
or three years.] He had. discussed the possibility of the
trip in 1963 with then-Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
and secured his agreement. He also talked with officers
of the Soviet Delegations Department, but after it had been
decided that he should go, the Chief of that Department,
{N.@.] ZHARIKOV, suggested that it might be unnecessary for
a security officer to accompany this particular delegation.
{A.G.] KOVALENKO, the new Chief of the Seventh Department,
supported NOSENKO's assignment as a personal favor. ‘Although
at one time NOSENKO said that GRIBANOV approved the trip, he
has later asserted ‘that GRIBANOV was.not involved and that
if GRIBANOV had learned of NOSENKO's plans, he would:not
have permitted NOSENKO to go.

NOSENKO's. only mission was to concern himself with the
general security of the delegation, as he had done in 1962.
He had no specific tasks such as on his earlier assignment
(e.g., investigating GIAKIDV or supervising the BELITSKIY
operation).

Comment: . NOSENKO has never, satisfactorily explained why
7 a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department would

draw an unrelated assignment abroad which
would last many weeks if not months. In
another context, NOSENKO had described a KGB
conference to take place about this time where
plans were to be drawn up for KGB operations
during the coming tourist season: he acknow-
ledged that he was expected to attend, but
nevertheless went to Geneva.

Visits to Legal Residenc

As in 1962, NOSENKO said he visited the Legal Resi-
dency daily. According to strict rules, he explained, an
officer in his status {temporary duty assignment which was
independent of Residency] should not do so, but his case
was exceptional because he was a Deputy Chief of Department
and because of the relationship he established in 1962
through the intervention of M.S. TSYMBAL. Illegals Direct~
orate Chief TSYMBAL, NOSENKO related in 1964, was an old
friend; they had become acquainted in Moscow before meeting
again in Geneva in 1962, when they dined together frequently.
TSYMBAL's wife once had taught NOSENKO in school, and
TSYMBAL had once offered NOSENKO a job in the Illegals
Directorate. NOSENKO asserted that TSYMBAL's introduction
of NOSENKO to Rezident GAVRICHEV in 1962 permitted NOSENKO
to frequent the Legal Residency in 1964.

Comment: In 1962 NOSENKO attributed his access to the
Residency to his "old friend Yuriy GUK", not
TSYMBAL, . He mentioned TSYMBAL's presence in
Geneva but claimed no close acquaintance,

Availability for Meetings with CIA

In 1964 NOSENKO behaved as if he had no official
responsibilities or any demands on his time, and he was
willing to spend all of his ‘time in meetings with CIA. . He
said that his absence from the Disarmament Delegation could
be explained as "security duties" since everyone on the
Delegation knew or suspected that he was a KGB officer.
From the first meeting on 24 January until 4 February,
NSOENKO met CIA officers thirteen times for meetings usually
lasting for five or six hours. By mutual agreement, most
of the meetings started in the afternoon. On two occasions
NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours and several meetings
continued until past midnight.

After returning to KGB Headquarters from Geneva in

opportunities to record what he learned of KGB operations
‘< in order-to inform CIA, and to pilfer appropriate KGB

which to keep the notes was just: fortuitous,
since neither all offices had such safes, nor
even all offices of Deputy Chiefs.

NOSENKO's Defection

On arrival for his first meeting with CIA during the
second Geneva. phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that
after long and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting
series, he had decided to defect. He explained that he had
recently been promoted to the position of First Deputy Chief
of the Seventh Department, and that because of the stature
and responsibilities of his new job, there would be few if
any Opportunities for him to visit the Nest in the future.
Therefore, he had decided to seize the opportunity at hand
and to flee to the United States at once, leaving his family
behind. He foresaw no possibility of his wife and children
being permitted to leave the USSR for the "next twenty
years". NOSENKO told CIA that. "the hardest thing is. to part
with my family". He had, however, carefully considered their
fate as the close relatives of a defector, and he felt that,
because of his mother's position in Soviet society, no harm
would come to them,

NOSENKO was told that CIA accepted in principle his
decision to defect. NOSENKO felt that it would be best for
him to disappear from Geneva without a trace, leaving all
his personal possessions behind; he assumed that CIA would
exfiltrate him from Switzerland to the United States. He
wanted to carry out this plan as soon as possible, but the
CIA officers encourayéd“him--and NOSENKO agreed--to remain
in place for at least three weeks more. The reasons given
NOSENKO for this request were:

~The desire ‘to obtain further information on the
local KGB Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to
the Disarmament Conference while he still had access;

OGL 593 320
TS No. 197124

Top Secret Copy _____


Top Secret

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT —- January. 1962-January 1964)

~The value of having NOSENKO present when. GRIBANOV
made a visit to Geneva about 7 February, a visit known |
to CIA only through NOSENKO;

~The ‘potential’ value ‘to be derived from NOSENKO's
in-place spotting of CIA recruitment targets among the
Soviet representation in Geneva; =

~The. necessity of making arrangements, acceptable to
NOSENKO,. for his defection and resettlement,

In a three~and-a-half hour meeting on 26 January
NOSENKO emphasized that although -he agreed that it was
necessary,-and useful for him to remain in- place until
GRIBANOV visited Geneva, he wanted to defect as soon as
possible thereafter.

On.28" January NOSENKO reported that GRIBANOV might not
be: coming ‘to Geneva’ after all, for. KGB Chairman Semichastnyy
was apparently reluctant to permit. him to travel beyond ‘
Vienna.  NOSENKO ‘said that’ he would probably have definite
information .on GRIBANOV's trip by the end of. the week.

On 30 January NOSENKO said that there appeared to be
‘Little likelihood: that. GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris.
[From .7 ‘to ‘10 February..1964:GRIBANOV was in Paris, where he
was''seen on the street with.a Soviet identified by NOSENKO
as ‘a KGB counterintelligence officer.] Therefore, he wanted

to'defect right away. He cited as reasons the émotional
strain .of. any ‘further delay and. the fact that he and his
case officers ‘were wasting.their time working against the
‘local KGB Legal Residency, which had: no worthwhile or
‘promising targets. -He also felt that nothing.of value could
‘be obtained from the Soviet delegation because. "Tsarapkitr
himself doesn't know what. he will say until he is-told: by
Moscow. the ‘day before"... CIA. handlers, however, delayed -the
defection for one week. by obtaining NOSENKO's .agreement
to assist in an’audio operation: CIA proposed to install
listening devices in the offices of the KGB Legal Residency, |
and NOSENKO said he would check .certain physical aspects
of the delegation buildings. As. the best time for. the
‘defection, he suggested Saturday morning,‘ 8 February,
because he-probably would not be missed until the following

Monday. This date was tentatively scheduled, ard NosriIKo
again repeated his desire simply to “disappear without a
trace". He also asked about exfiltration plans. :

On 31 January NOSENKO reported the results of his
reconnaissance bf the KG2 Legal Residency in connection with
the proposed audio operation, which would involve microphone
transmitters operating on a carrier current. He told CIA he
had accidentally overheard in the Residency that the building
used its own batteries and generator, and therefore the
scheme would not work. He repeated his willingness to remain
in place until the arrival of the CHEREPANOV Papers, (see
p-309) which he was told were en route from Washington. - He
explained that he had been alarmed at the previous meeting
because the delegation was supposed to move from its hotel
to a Soviet villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappea-
rance would be noticed more quickly. This move, as he had
now learned has Leen postponed pending the arrival of a
housekeeping officer from Moscow.

At NOSENKO's request on 1 February, it was firmly
agreed that the defection would take place on the morning of
8 February. NOSENKO assumed that exfiltration would Le by
automobile to Nest Germany and thence by plane to the United
States, and his case officers confirmed his assumption.

On 3 February NOSENKO reviewed the CHERFPANOV materials.
The defection was still scheduled for Saturday, 8 February.

NOSENKO' telephoned the Geneva safehouse from his hotel
room in the early afternoon of 4 February and said: "I want
to come now and not go back." After arriving at the CIA
safehouse he explained that when he dropped by the KGB Legal
Residency following the morning session of the Disarmament
Conférence, he read a-cabie ordering him to return to Moscow
immediately to prepare for a KGE conference on foreian tourism
in the Soviet Union. The residency was arranging for a
ticket for NOSENKO to fly to Moscow via Paris the following
day and a replacement was being readied to assume NOSENKO's
duties as security officer for the Soviet delegation in
Geneva. Before he had left for Geneva.in January, NOSENKO
then related, the Soviet Government had Leen deliberating
the question of expanding foreign tourism in the USSR and had

agreed to open a number of new. cities and. tourist. itineraries
in this connection.. Semichastnyy had decided that it was
time to-call a conference to discuss new “tactics and stra-
‘tegies" for handling the increased number of tourists
expected. ‘Since NOSENKO had been placed.in charge. of. the
entire conference, he was directed to leave’ at once to He
prepare a basic report on the KGB handling. of ‘tourists; the
réport ‘would be read to the conference éither by himself or
by- someone.from' the leadership of the KGB’ or the Second Chief

‘who ‘could, dothis job as Lt. 'Col.A.G. KOVALENKO, the KGB
Headquarters Department- senior officer, was.a relatively. new
man ‘in: this line of operations, having been there only four: |
or five years, perhaps less;. NOSENKO also told CIA. that: "by
great. coincidence" he had learned, just before the cable ae
arrived, he was. being moved to’the Soviet villa on the
“morning of 5.February..He had arranged for a Soviet. chauf-
feur to bring ‘a car around at/0930 hours ‘the next morning

no real concern until ‘the’ evening: . To: foster Soviet 5

early. ‘on the 6th. pete eeeennie :

NOSENKO was driven.to.Frankfurt the night. of ‘4..Fébruary

The notes NOSENKO brought to CIA in Geneva in 1964
(see p.319) included brief reference to thirteen other KGB
Operations conducted against what NOSENKO described as
tourists during the 1962+1963 period. For reasons cited

tourist operations, and, specifically, awareness of all
significant KGB operations against American tourists.

Information Furnished the KGB by George BLAKE

The KGB agent’ in MI-6, George BLAKE, in 1959 furnished
the KGB with a documentary account of the joint CIA-MI-6
meeting in June of that year, (see p.148) and he was to
furnish other information by which the KGB could keep
current on such hostile operations. Another CIA-MI-6 meeting
was held in Washington in April 1960, of which a twenty-one
page summary was made. BLAKE also passed this document as
soon as it came into his possession to the KGB.

KGB Study of American Intelligence Tourist Operations

The lengthy 1961 KGB Top Secret study referred to earlier
(see p.149) reflects the detailed and accurate information
in possession of the KGB during the period of NOSENKO's
alleged service in the Seventh Department in 1962-1963.
Pertinent portions are quoted--as follows:

"It has been established that the Intelligence
organs of the. USA are displaying special activity
in the utilization of legal channels, specifically,
in tourism, for the purpose of conducting subversive
work against the USSR. Numerous facts indicate that
American tourists and members of various US delega-
tions, in the USSR strive to visit areas and instal-
lations to which employees of the Embassy and mili-
tary attaches have no access, establish contact with
Soviet citizens, and collect intelligence informa-
tion. In this regard, the channels of tourism to
the USSR are used to dispatch experienced intelligence
agents to develop individual Soviet citizens with
the objective of their eventual recruitment. In
line with the preparation and dispatch of such :
agents, among the tourists the Americans also make
extensive use of persons not directly connected
with American Intelligence organs. These latter
agents are given one-time assignments such as
collecting information leading to the ideological
development of Soviet citizens.

of his social status or his personal access to important
information, is of interest, because of his ability to
travel to regions of the USSR which are of interest to
American Intelligence.

“American Intelligence tourist agents suspect as KGB
agents Soviet citizens who too openly express anti-
government sentiments, who volunteer information about
friends or relatives who work in secret establishments,
who accept an invitation for a clandestine meeting but
display an awareness of security principles, who quickly
request aid or assistance in defecting, or who have a
good knowledge of foreign languages."

Union from 35,000 in 1959 to over 50,000 in 1960, the docu-

| BLAKE's confession and evidence obtained from internal
| KGB documents establish the KGB concern for the threat of
American tourist agent operations and the scope of KGB

g actions to thwart that threat. The effect of NOSENKO's

described accurately depicted the nature of KGB counter-
intelligence operations during the period.

According to NOSENKO,. in January 1962, at the direction of
General GRIBANOV, he was appointed Chief of the Seventh De-

) partment American-British Commonwealth Section in the expec-
tancy that he soon would be named a Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department. As a Section Chief, he personally handled agents

_ and supervised all Second Chief Directorate Operations against

[ American and British Commonwealth tourists, of which he de-
Scribes four. In this period NOSENKO also was assigned the

} unrelated duty of serving as a security escort officer with a

| Soviet delegation travelling to Geneva in which Capacity he in-
vestigated a delegate of suspected loyalty, SHAKHOV. While in

On that visit to Geneva NOSENKO first’ contacted CIA. In July
1962, NOSENKO claims that as GRIBANOV promised, he became one
of three Deputy Chiefs of the entire Seventh Department; in
this position he learnea of all KGB operations against Ameri-
Can tourists. In this connection he’ described five operations,
as well as his accidental discovery of the identity of an
American GRU agent, and tne investigation and search for a
disaffected former KGB colleague. In July ‘1963 NOSENKO states

CHAPTER IX

OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSE!KO'S KGB SERVICE

Most of NOSENKO's assertions can be examined in a chrono-
logical fashion, as has been done in the proceding sections.
Some can most easily be examined separately, since they
relate not to any particular period of his KGB service nor
to any specific position he claimed he occupied, but to his
entire KGB career. The principal aspects in this category
of claims are those he made about his relationship with
Second Chief Directorate General GRIBANOV, his Party status,
his knowledge of certain KGB forms and procedures, his
sourcing of KGB operations, awards he earned for KGB service,
and his KGB rank.

Relationship with General GRIBANOV

From his first meeting with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO main-
tained that he had a close personal and professional rela-
tionship with Major General GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second
Chief Directorate. NOSENKO described recruitment approaches
in which he and GRIBANOV took part together, conversations
they had on operational matters, the role which GRIBANOV
played in his promotions, awards and assignments, and their
after hours carrousing. According to NOSENKO, GRIBANOV was
wholly responsible, against NOSINKO's wishes, for his
appointment to the position of Deputy Chief of the American
Department Embassy Section in 1960, and when NOSENKO later
rejected GRIBANOV's offer to make him Chief of the entire
American Department, it was GRIBANOV who arranged his return
to the Seventh Department as Chief of the American-British
Commonwealth Section and who shortly thereafter appointed
him a Deputy Chief and thereafter First Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Department.

Chairman, the Orders of the Red Banner, the Red Star, and
the Order of Lenin (Retracted. NOSENKO received no such
awards.); GRIBANOV ordered NOSENKO' to Geneva in 1962
(Retracted. — NOSENKO went at the request of the Soviet
Delegations Abroad Department.); GRIBANOV ordered NOSENKO
to assume charge of the BELITSKIY case (Contradicted.
NOSENKO did not supervise the BELITSKIY case.); GRIBANOV
allowed NOSENKO to go to Geneva in 1964, "as a personal
favor" (Retracted. GRIBANOV was not aware that NOSENKO
was to return to Geneva a second time.): and finally,
GRIBANOV was NOSENKO's patron (Retracted. Their relation-
ship was no closer than their relative rank and position

indicated.)

Conclusion

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to
his claimed relationship with GRIBANOV discredit his single
and most important unretracted claim, that NOSENKO, on
GRIBANOV's appointment was Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department.

Comment: NOSENKO is the only Soviet official known to
CIA who claims to have occupied a position of
trust and who claims he was not a Party member
at the time,

In the period following, "to show his eagerness" and’ "to
improve himself", NOSENKO asked for Party assignments. For
more than a year he ran errands and collected newspapers and
performed other such tasks. He stated that he applied for
Party membership in January 1956, was accepted as a candidate
member in 1956, and that he was accepted as a full Party
member in 1957.

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims about his Party activity do not ‘sustain
his claims to KGB service, and they suffer from identical
discrepancies with respect to chronology, plausibility,
and contradiction by independent sources. It is concluded
that NOSENKO was never a Komsomol secretary and, if a member
at all, was no longer a member after reaching his twenty-
sixth birthday in October 1953. The period in which he had
no Party status was twenty-eight months, not the fifteen he
claimed, and it covers the period of his first tour in the
Embassy Section as well as a portion of his initial Seventh
Department assignment. An officer unqualified for Party
membership is ineligible-for:KGB service. Consequently, the
evidence provided by examination of NOSENKO's Party status
indicates that he was not serving in the K63B through at
least a portion of the 1953-1956 period,

Comment: The form is completed by every KGB officer, and
while it is not of critical importance to the
KGB itself, a copy is filed in every officer's

secretary or supervisor responsible for reviewing
KGB personnel files.

NOSENKO was unfamiliar with the name of the KGB personnel
action form, and said he did not know of it. When its purpose
was described to him, he gave a superficial description of
its content.

Comment: A senior KGB officer would be familiar with the
form, which he would see on every occasion in
which one of his subordinates was promoted or
transferred.

NOSENKO was familiar with the Employment and Service
Record (Posluzhnoy Spisok), but he claimed he filled it out
only in “1958 or 1957",

Comment: The Employment and Service Record is completed
on entry on duty with the KGB. In citing 1957
or 1958, NOSENKO’is claiming that he completed
it only four or five years after entering the

Conclusion

NOSENKO's ignorance of the foregoing forms and procedures
is evidence that he did not occupy the position nor perform
the functions he claimed during his alleged KGB service.

Awards and Decorations

Since 1964 NOSENKO has claimed to have received various
awards, commendations, and decorations for his KGB service.
His assertions are material to any judgment of his general
credibility and, as well of the validity of his claims to
having occupied various KGB positions.

In January 1964 NOSENKO mentioned that in 1962, shortly
after meeting with CIA in Geneva, he received the Order of
Lenin for ideas which he developed to “enlarge the experience
and improve the quality" of Second Chief Directorate per-
sonnel in Moscow.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO was asked about
his awards, and he first said he received the Order of the
Red Banner,.then corrected himself to say he received first
the Order of the Red Star. He confirmed that he received
the Order of Lenin, in 1963. [Earlier he had said 1962,
“just. following visiting Geneva".] He ciaAimed he received
the Order of Lenin for his performance in his Seventh
Department assignment, but when he was asked what recruit-
ments justified his receipt of the award, he said the main
task of the Seventh Department was not to make recruitments,
but to counter the hostile intelligence service operations.
(For his contradictory statements regarding the Seventh
Department's mission, see pages i03 and 326.] The Order
of Lenin was the highest decoration for which a KGB officer
is eligible, NOSENKO said, and besides himself, the Chief
and former Chief of the Seventh Department received it.
NOSENKO said he received in 1962 the Order of the Red Star,
he "thought" for his service in the Embassy Section in 1960-
1961, not for Seventh Department service; no explanation
accompanied that decoration.

The *question of NOSENKO's awards, orders and decorations
were of,some interest to the interrogators since. they might
reflect the importance. the KGB attached to. particular i:
‘operational activities in which NOSENKO engaged. However,
before the April 1964 interrogations were suspended, NOSENKO
retracted his claim. that he received the Order of Lenin,
saying that it was just an idle boast. GRIBANOV,; NOSENKO

_@xplained, had promised in .1963 that NOSENKO, CHELNOKOV,

and KOVALENKO would receive the. Order of Lenin "for creating
the Central Operational Communications System of the Second
Chief Directorate" within the Seventh Department, but the
award had not materialized before NOSENKO left for Geneva in
January 1964. ie a :

Comment: - Earlier NOSENKO.claimed he received the Order
, for ideas he developed "to enlarge the experi-
ence- and improve the quality of Second Chié£t
Directorate personnel". Questioned, NOSENKO
reverted to the earlier claim.

Inthe April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO was’ asked. to’

‘list the dates, reasons,. and types of awards, decorations,

and bonuses he had received “in his KGB career. He replied
that he received nothing from 1953 until 1956, when -he
received. a commendation, and one month's pay for the recruit-
fetscit see p-l15]. by order of the KGB Chairman Serov.
GRIBANO nformed him of the commendation, NOSENKO said, and
NOSENKO:saw his name onthe list of recipients which was
circulated. No written certificate accompanied the commen-
dation, according to NOSENKO, but personnel recorded the
event in each KGB. recipient's. personnel file.. Almost every
year.after 1956,.NOSENKO ‘stated, he received something, ~
“perhaps -on. the KGB anniversary, or May Day, or Army Day".
In 1957 or 1958, NOSENKO did not recall exactly, he. received:
“something" from GRIBANOV, “maybe on the anniversary of the
Soviet Army": GRIBANOV's' deputy; PERFILYEV, made the presen-
tation at.an assembly of officers in the KGB Headquarters

Comment: A week later, NOSENKO said that he received this
award in December 1962. He said he recalled
that the presentation was planned for the KGB
Anniversary on 20 December, but the presentation
was delayed and not made until the end of the
month.

In 1962, NOSENKO claimed, he received another -commendation
from GRIBANOV for “general good work", and he also received
the Unblemished Service Award for ten years' service,

Comment: At this juncture his interrogators reminded
NOSENKO that his most recently claimed date
of entry to the KGB was March 1953, and that
in 1962 he would only have had nine years'
service. NOSENKO said that he could not under-
stand why, but he was certain he recé@ived the
service award after his return from Geneva in
1962.. (The date is consistent with NOSENKO's
earlier retracted claim that he entered the
KGB in 1952.) The following day NOSENKO
announced that he recalled why “he received the
medal in 1962 rather than in 1963; the medal
was awarded to servicemen as well as to KGB
officers, and prior military service is taken
into account in computing KGB officers' time

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims to having been the recipient of various
awards for KGB service are inextricably linked with his
claimed operational successes, his rank, and GRIBANOV's
patronage, on all of which topics he had made virtually
categoric retractions.

mF Pt

NOSENKO's Sourcing

NOSENKO cited four general sources for KGB operations he
has related, and in all four there have been inconsistencies,
contradictions, and retractions. Three of these categories,
each with an example typifying the difficulty of judging the
validity of his sourcing, are personal participation WE.

Qbofficidl duties (SHUBIN), p. 296), and information obtained
informally from KGB colleagues (Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON,
p.24). The fourth category of sourcing relates to the

notes of KGB operations which he brought to CIA in Geneva
in 1964. :

Regarding the notes, NOSENKO said he collected them at
various opportunities in order to bring them to CIA. He
kept them in a wall safe in’ the: office which he occupied as
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department. [In this connection,
NOSENKO admitted that not all offices had such wall safes,
and not all offices of Deputy Chiefs of Departments, but
asserted that his did.] Most of the notes are in NOSENKO's
handwriting. Those that are not include the only copy of a
typed top secret. summary report from one'of-the- Seventh
Department section chiefs, a similar handwritten report by
another Seventh Department officer, and a carbon co ofa
KGB document which summarized the recruitment of an! Austrian} |/

remaining notes from such sources as. the "Special File",
which was held ordinarily by the Seventh Department Chief.

reasons from time to time... The "Special File" contained. no
true names, however,..and NOSFENKO said he obtained such true.
names as were-included in his notes by asking various’ case
officers for. them. Questioned’on case. after case which. -
appeared in his notes, .NOSENKO insisted that he had. written
everything, he could-learn, and. could ‘add nothing more.°

Conclusion

NOSENKO's. sourcing for many of the events he. has related».
is not credible: eee

NOSENKO's’ KGB Rank

When. he first: met with CIA in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO
identified himself as. a KGB officer holding the rank of
major.:.He said. at that time that. he‘had served the requisite

“time -in grade and expected to be promoted shortly to the _°:
rank of ‘lieutenant colonel. On defecting in 1964..NOSENKO”
said that he was’ a. lieutenant colonel... In thé. course of his
career. as he initially described it, his’ military rank pro-
motions had generally parallelied his assumption of

successively greater supervisory responsibilities, culminating.

in his becoming Deputy Chief of the Seventh. Department.

statements about. his rank-is Significant with respect to his

in.1964 a KGB document identifying him as a. lieutenant d

he -held supervisory positions in which KGB officers of
significantly senior rank were his subordinates. |

(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

In June 1962 NOSENKO volunteered that he was then a major,
but that he would soon be promoted to lieutenant colonel.

In 1964, in Frankfurt awaiting transportation to the
United States, NOSENKO reviewed and approved a biographic
statement which included the claim that he had been a senior
lieutenant in the American Embassy Section from 1952 (sic)
until 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major
in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO claimed that
at the end of 1953 or the beginning of 1954 [not in 1952]
he was promoted to the rank of senior lieutenant. When it
was pointed out to him that that was less than a year after
he. entered.the KGB, he asserted that his Naval RU service
was taken into consideration.

Asked in June 1964 to list his promotions, chronologically,
NOSENKO asserted that he became a senior lieutenant in 1953,
in 1956 a captain, in 1959 a major and, in October [in
Geneva, just afterwards, he said November] 1963, he was
advised by Personnel that he had been promoted to lieutenant
colonel and afterwards was personally congratulated by
General GRIBANOV. NOSENKO did not recall the month of his
earlier promotions.

Comment: KGB defectors have commented that it would be
: unusual for a KGB officer not to recall-his
date of rank, from which he computes. his
seniority and time in grade towards his next
promotion.

In January 1965, while discussing his role as case officer
for Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN, NOSENKO volun-
teered out of context that he had never been a major nor was
he promoted to captain in 1956, as he had claimed earlier.

He explained that he became eligible for captain in 1956,
but his promotion was withheld as punishment because he had
obtained treatment for a venereal disease under an alias,

NOSENKO said in October 1966 interrogations that he had
lied when he had claimed in 1964 to be a lieutenant colonel,
that actually he had been but a captain. Asked why he had
claimed in 1962 that he had been a major, NOSFNKO denied
that he had ever even mentioned his rank to CIA in 1962.

Conclusion

NOSENKO has stated that he became a senior lieutenant in
the KGB in 1952, April 1953, 1954, or, 1956. He was promoted
to the rank of captain in 1956 or September /October/December
1959; a major in December 1958 or 1959; and a lieutenant
colonel in October/November 1963. He brought to Geneva in
1964, an official KGB document dated’ November 1963 identifying
him as a KGB lieutenant colonel. In retracting his claim
that he was ever a major or lieutenant colonel, NOSENKO
asserts that nevertheless as a captain, he held the position
of First Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to
his KGB rank parallel and are apparently related to his
contradicted and retracted claims regarding Naval RU
‘service, date of entry to the KGB, KGB assignments. and
positions held, and in short, to the totality of his claims
regarding KGB service, few of which are credible.

Psychiatric Examination

Since April 1964 NOSENKO has been under the observation
of the CIA psychiatrist. Besides monitoring many of the
interrogation sessions, the psychiatrist has visited NOSENKO
weekly for the first year, monthly until 1967, and at some-
what less frequent intervals since,

Findings
NOSENKO is neither psychotic nor neurotic. Of above

average intelligence, he is shrewd, perceptive, and highly
adaptable. His memory is not defective. Besides suffering
from ordinary lapses of memory, however, he sometimes
falsely. claims lack of recall, NOSENKO's thought processes
are unimpaired; he is rational and fully capable of distin-
guishing fact from fiction.

PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT: Conclusion

The findings of the psychologist and psychiatrist dispel
the notion that NOSENKO's behavior and his statements are
other than willful.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

NOSENKO claims. that he served for a decade in the KGB in
successively senior positions of authority from which he
derived extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and
results of KGB,operations against Americans in the Soviet
Union in the period. 1953-1963. To substantiate his claim,
he provides an impressive array of information about KGB
personnel, organization and operations which, to the extent
that it has been confirmed, is presumptive evidence of ‘his
bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including ,intelli-

‘gence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's
- claims. z Sana s ee ea

The examination has compared each element.of NOSENKO's
biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known
facts and reasonable surmise. ‘The examination reflects

. the test to which his accounts were put: whether his
accounts are internally coherent ‘and consistent with known.
fact, and whether he actually gained the .information he has

“from occupying the KGB positions he claims to have held.

In short, is he what he. says he.is, according to his. own
v accounts? ‘ : : 4

(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS) ©

This examination had led to the following findings,
arrived at independently:

~-NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the
capacities or at the places and times he claimed.

~NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at
the time he claimed.

“-NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section
throughout the 1953-1955 period as he claimed,

“During the period 1955-1960, he was neither a senior
case officer in, nor Deputy Chief of, the Seventh Depart-
ment American-British Commonwealth Section.

~NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the American
Embassy Section nor a senior officer or supervisor in
the Section during the period 1961-1962.

“NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the
American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter
a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible,

~NOSENKO has no. valid.claim to certainty that the KGB
recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and
his defection in 1964,

These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of
ais probability or certif€ude, but they reflect the preponderance
of available evidence in each instance.

The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive
evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides. The contradictions in
NOSENKO's accounts of his life and KGB service are so
extensive as to make his claims asa whole unacceptable.
While truth and fact in this case frequently cannot be
established with certainty, it is evident that truth and
fact are not what NOSENKO relates. By almost any test,
virtually any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by
fact or probability, or contradicted or retracted in his own
statements. NOSENKO is not what he claims to be, and thus
he is not a bona fide defector.

(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS)

- Given the conclusion’ that NOSENKO is not a bona fide
defector,. itis necessary to attempt: to determine his true

“ motives. for contacting American Intelligence and for.

providing the information he has given. Here, it must be :
recognized that the evidence, largely consisting: of NOSENKO's
‘own assertions, does not permit unequivocal conclusions,
Nevertheless, ‘the question cannot be ignored. ‘The character
of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact. that ‘some

of his.false. claims have been corroborated by Soviet offi-
cials, and the necessity to. make decisions about ‘ NOSENKO's
future all require that at least a provisional ‘judgment: be
made. y ;

., Of the reasonable explanations. advanced for NOSENKO's
misrepresentations, the chief ones.are that he is-a
swindler posing. asa’ former KGB officer for: reasons of
personal advantage; that. he suffers from a deranged person~
ality.or unbalanced mind; that he has greatly exaggerated

“his’ actual rank, status and. access in the KGB, for simply

personal reasons;: or, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB

slagent. 7 <

The first two possibilities are easily dismissed. -That
NOSENKO is not simply.a swindéer who falsely claims for
personal. advantage.'to have been a KGB officer is evident,
we believe, from the confirmed details of KGB organization,
Personnel ‘and operations which. he has -provided sand. which
could only derive from. within the KGB itself. -

Second, as-noted in. the text, extensive: psychiatric and :
psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out
the possibility.that NOSENKO's actions and testimony are the
product “of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind.: :

It. is somewhat more plausible that NOSENKO isa KGB
officer who served in at: least some of the components for.
some or.all of the time periods that ‘he claims, but who

» greatly exaggerated his positions, rank’ and access to infor=

mation, and invented. some matters-outright, to achieve

greater status with American Intelligence.: - This explanation,
however, fails‘ to accommodate the fact that. several KGB. ‘|
officers have asserted .that NOSENKO did in: fact hold senior

(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS)

positions in the KcB. Also, NOSENKO's assertions with
respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's patronage, the recall
telegram, and the like, cannot be just a product of his own
invention, since these were the subject of comment by other
sources,

the KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile all the
anomalies, none of them renders it untenable,

In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or
other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that
the evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was
dispatched by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires
that he be regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and
that his information should be assessed accordingly.
