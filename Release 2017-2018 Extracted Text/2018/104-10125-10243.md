Suoject: Background on Mexico Stetion Support Assets
(Coverege of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1, (Unilateral coverage. From the tine the

xico Stetion was opened in
April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to EEE
exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
coasisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a ail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by an employee of the telerhone company
Wate ol we Resales,
‘Who was) handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines
oy
4 Aa
tapped was limted by availaoility of a listening post nearby
(since the taps were not rade in the nain central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

(which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they telked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help ’
of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIc,
and LICALIA), LIMITED was a fixed site nang opposite across
the street from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had i
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate’was on the

Northiest corner.of their compound and L:’

TED was diagonally

thet block. LIMITED was the first bese and it operated strictly on an

rinestel basis in the early stages, I think the i!exi Station bought
one storey
this property .(2/Ssanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSIIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the

public by the Warren Coamission, The photo operators vere moved to another apt
neerby. The property was sold (under an operational agreenent with LIMOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built
on this site), " LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor check) on the sane side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slautéd view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy, The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both
Mexican fanilies) as far as we Imew, were not acquainted with each other.
LILYRIG was a rented apartzent, LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a'row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Enbassy compound
which the Mexico Station purckased in about 1958 (check date), also using
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of
the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation ics to get good
identificetion photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time vere largely
unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites vere handled by
Renon Alverez\ (Mexican citizen of U.S, nother who taught elexentary level at’

\ the American School). Ranon collected the film epltentesutienttim from LIMITED
and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husbend,)Carlos (Mexican Goctor)
developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan
was for LICALLA film to ve, processed fasiée 30 nan fron 1957 to 1959: (Harper

“Holt ~ resigned) could not handle the volume and as the unprocessed film’ began
to accumilate, the inside co (vahoney) became disgusted and took the filn out
for; Ramon's\ brather-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus. Raxon becane

vas run out of another ohe of these houses (erypt for the four houses wes

1, ete), This was hazdled by Clen WIDDEN (outside TSD officer) and

Mahoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This operation vas also separate

from LICALLA, The two houses in between vere rented to unsusrecting tenants.

©, Hobile surveillance ves developed by Anderson and later placed
under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho. This teen consisted of a half
dozen or so agents who used three to four late nodel cars end a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera-e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (fron LIKITED 4SR)

when soneone of interest left a gate ard stay with then
until they nade their meetings. ‘These agents knew about the LEITED
BASE tedause they had LDWTED photos for identification purposes.
This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)
When one of the surveillance egents got too close to his terget and
eeaferrettca by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the
Hexican Secret Service. By the time the Stetion could arrange through
a cleared attorney to bail hin out (Judd Austin of the Goodrich;

Little and Riquelme firm), the agent. had identified Sancho (vho ves

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside-——
phone nunber of Mahoney (who was subsequently replaced ty Louis
Puckett). As a result of this flap, the LIFFAT project was broken
up into several others. The agents were not changed but vere given

3. ¥y nenory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Exbassy but I
think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New
Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a nakeshift arrangezent of volunteers

their activities end recruitivg egents right and left auong Cuban nationals in

to get to Scott before 9.a.m.) Later’ (when the reel vas coupletely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Stetion in the same vay, however,
there was usually 2 time leg of a day or so. Those transcripts which nda
Russien or another lenguage besides Sanish or English vent out of the listening
post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel) was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were trensleted
end typed. Ih the case of the Russien translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ren
about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations among the uembers of the Soviet Eubassy. During this

period (Ze11 of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the staticn
and carried to Boris by'one of the people from the Soviet Section or they ney
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave a
