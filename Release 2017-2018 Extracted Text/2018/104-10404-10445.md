SECRET

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Lawrence J. LABORDE, 201-294688

1.

On ll May 1967 the headquarters office of the Domestic

Contacts Service telephoned the C/CI/R&A and said that Subject had

telephoned the New Orleans office of the DCS that day. Subject said that

he was an ex-CIA employee, that he feared that D.A. Jim GARRISON

would subpoena him, that he was willing to leave the U.S. to avoid a

subpoena, and that he wanted the office to tell him what to do.

A review of Subject's file has led to the hypothesis that this

visit may have been a provocation, probably engineered by GARRISON

in an atteinpt to trap CIA into advising Subject to leave Louisiana.

Had such advice been given, GARRISON would have been able to buttress

his charge that CIA is attempting to obstruct the course of justice in

New Orleans.

The Miami Station requested a provisional covert security

approval for Subject.on 14 March 1961. The request was granted on

24 March 1961. (A PCSA approves contact for spotting and assessing

only.) However, a 31 March 1961 cable from Miami requested per-

mission to increase Subject's salary to $700 a month and to pay him

bonuses.

A Headquarters dispatch of 23 March 1962 warned Miami

that Subject was indiscreet, drank too much, and had an unsavoury

reputation, On 20 April 1962 Miami cancelled the request for an

approval, on the grounds that Subject was a poor security risk.

Subject had no later relationship with the Agency. Subject was bitter

about his CIA contacts when terminated and made reckless threats.

An FBI report of 23 May 1962 said Subject had contacted

representatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC, Agency-created

and supported) in New Orleans, his home town; had offered his services;

and had said he was running a boat out of Key West, smuggling Cubans

and guns with the knowledge of CIA.

6.

A Miami report of June 1962 said that Subject was employed

1947-1949 in Mexico by the U.S. Department of Agriculture but was

fired for excessive drinking, discharging unauthorized firearms, and

non-support of dependent children.

The New Orleans States-Item of 28 July 1962 named Subject

as the source of bitterly anti-CIA remarks in a story which praises

LABORDE as a "good family man, completely reliable", and quotes a

Cuban refugee leader as saying that CIA and FBI agents termed Subject

a man of integrity. An anti-CIA article in the Denver Post of 3 June 1962

also appears to be based on statements from LABORDE.

FBI reporting of August 1962 stated that LABORDE had duped

certain persons into buying a schooner, the Elsie Reichart, by saying

that he and a crew would operate it for Cuban operations which the

U.S. Government could not openly acknowledge but for which it would

pay handsomely.
