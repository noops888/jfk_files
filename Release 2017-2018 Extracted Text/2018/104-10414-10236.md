SUBBECT : The Photo of an Unidentified Individual in the Warren
Conmission Report: A Factual Chronological Survey

REFERENCE: Memorandum by David W. Belin to Mr..€.. Harry Knoche,
15 April 1975 (Attachment A) 7

1. Reference memorandum suggests it would be appropriate to

" reconsider full disclosure at this time of the circumstances and factual

data relative to the Subject. The purpose of this survey is to pemit a

realistic evaluation of the suggestion.

Background

2. This examination and summary of the record concerns a cropped
photograph considered by the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy (hereinafter cited as the Warren Commission) and
introduced into evidence as Odum Exhibit No. ies The photograph

(together with others of the same individual) originated from a highly

Embassies in Mexico City.

: 3. Under the extraordinary press of effort.to develop information
on the assassin and the assassination, copies’ of the photograph were
made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief. on ithe afternoon, of

22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,
assertedly on the decision of the ‘Ambassador , copies were conveyed by
an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval
Attaché to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing
investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was shown to

Mrs. Marguerite, OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the
evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM.

4, The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of events
at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted in
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped
photo of Jack RUBY the day before he murdered her son. (A further
complication compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that
when She had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Commission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in

a slightly different manner. )

5. No detail in the Warren Commission report illustrates more

vividly than this one the difficulties that beset simple truth in the

politicized, rigidly deterministic interpretive climate that has been

nurtured by the media over the past decade about the Kennedy Assassina-

. tion. The photograph, acknowledged now not to be RUBY, has continued to |

preoccupy “specialists” and has becone the centerpiece of another
e
hypothesis that holds OSWALD to have been "framed" by the use of a

double. in his activity in Mexico City.2

lee Harvey OSWALD - Reporting on Mexico City Stay

6. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his stay in
Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the morning of
2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man
originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is important, therefore, to
an understanding of the acquisition and handling of the photographs by
the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertained and did with
the information it developed about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with

Headquarters action on that information.

7. From all credible evidence known to this time (none, incidentally,
added since the exhaustively unique work of the Warren Commission),
Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and two (2) partial days--

about 116 hours in all--in Mexico City from about 10:00 a.m. 27 September

1963 to about 8:30 a.m. 2 October 1963. His place of residence was a
small commercial traveler hotel, not frequented by "gringos"--the

Hotel Conerci o--where he was registered under alias. Exhaustive and
detailed interviews and interrogation by the Mexican authorities and

the FBI, after the assassination, established that in the recollection of

all hotel personnel he left early and returned late each day of his stay.

8: Assuming, and allowing for the fact of late arrival and early

departure; that he slept one-third of the time of his stay (38 or 39

hours), there Yemain some 78 hours: of activity to be accounted for.
Overall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods
during 27, 28 September and 1 October. All coverage by CIA during the

entire period was technical. The Station had no live source (living

jateral or from Mexi

agent) coverage(either unil

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense “under investi-
gation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in the USSR and
return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were known to Mexico Station files
before 10 October 1963, when the bare bones of his biography were
forwarded by Headquarters in response to a Station cabled report of
8 October which had forwarded, on a routine basis, what appeared to be
a contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR. This
was indicated and deduced from technically acquired information on
1 October, which was the first and only occasion in which OSWALD

identified himself (partially) by true name.

10. At no time during his stay in Mexico City did the CIA acquire

a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage, voice intercept,
if as well as photographic, of both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies was
conducted by the. Station on 22 and 23 November 1963 after. the assassina-
i tion, going back to materials from August 1963. tt is, therefore, firm
that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD. at any time during his

: Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a
cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico station had no photo.of OSWALD
in its records, nor did it receive one fron Headquarters--which did not:

have one either--before 22 November 1963.

cept--which had been reported to Headquarters and disseminated to the
i interested members of the intelligence community (as an ex-Marine OSWALD
was a Navy and FBI case under the Delimitations Agreement, and potentially
of interest to the Department of State)--turned up matches based on
content with materials intercepted on 27 and 28 September 1963. These
matches were reported to Headquarters on 23 November 1963. Analysis
based on voice comparison (except for what could be recalled by the
monitor--and this was not an insignificant element because of the
memorably poor Russian spoke by OSWALD) could not be made because the

tapes, in accordance with the normal practice, had been erased and re-used.

12 It must be stressed that the voice intercept.and photographic
coverage was not (and. normally is not) processed in "real time." The
means of acquisition and the volume of the information precludes anything
but the spot reporting of items judged by the monitor to be of more than
ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in summary logs . Full texts of
selected items require consultation of the tape and either a full tran-
scription or full translation or, both. Photo coverage tends to become
available in quantity lots which requires scanning and selection on.a
rapid and accelerated basis in four or five day “peaks.” One of the
"triggers" that normal ly operates to focus and accelerate more speedy
review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of
aname. This was precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa-
tions on 1 October with the Soviet Embassy, during which the speaker said
he was “Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to
Headquarters in its first indication on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

13. The Mexico Station did one more thing in its 8 October report.
on Lee OSWALD based on its 1 October voice intercepts: it coupled the
data with descriptive information it had acquired fron a sensitive
collateral source--a photograph of a male individual, apparently an
American, who was observed entering the Soviet Embassy on 1 October.
The Station reported this detail on the 8th as a matter of coincident
fact. The Station did not assert or suggest that the data deduced fron

the photo was in fact OSWALD, or indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of His Mexico City Stay

14. One additional element of background must be stipulated now as
the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)
of the photo ‘of the unknown individual placed in the chain of evidence
on 23 November in Dallas by FBI Agent Bardwell ODUM: ‘what was the
totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the after-

noon of the 23rd when all available coverage had been checked?

15. “The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1605 hours Mexico City time.
Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee of the Cuban
Embassy, Consular section, a receptionist, speaks with an unknown
male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia DURAN tells the man that the
American citizen was there, the one who wants a visa for Cuba on
his way to the Soviet Union, and he wants to know with whom he was
talking there because she (Silvia DURAN) ‘had sent him to the Soviet
Embassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa, then
the Cubans (Embassy) would also give hima visa without further
paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The American, she
says, wants to know with whom he had talked there because he says
he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

Embassy says to wait a moment. A different Soviet speaks, and

SevC REET.

Silvia DURAN explains the same thing to him. This man says to
leave a name and telephone number and says he will call back.
Silvia DURAN gives the telephone 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate).

She also takes advantage of the conversation, and states she has
moved and wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of her change of
address so that she can receive the Soviet Embassy's Bulletin.

The man says to call KOUKHARENKO to give her new address 7 then he i
asks the name of the Consu? or Cultural Attache. Silvia DURAN says
the name is Teresa PROENZA and the telephone number is 14-13-26.

The man says thanks.

b. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1626 hours Mexico City time.

An unidentified male, a Soviet, calls the Cuban Consulate, asks
Silvia DURAN if the American had been there.- Silvia DURAN says he
is there now. The Soviet says the American showed papers fron the
Consulate in Washington, that he wants to go to the Soviet Union
and be there for-a long time with his wife, who is Russian, but
the answer has not come from Washington in respect to this problem,
and according to this procedure it takes four or five months, but
without having permission from the Soviet Union they should ask, or
better said, they cannot issue a visa there without asking Washing-
ton. However, according to this man, he showed a letter indicating
he was a member of an organization in favor of Cuba and that the

Cubans said that they cannot issue a visa without his -having a visa

for the Soviet Union, and now he (the Soviet) does not know what to
do with him (the American), because they have to wait for an answer
from Washington.

Silvia DURAN agrees the same prob tein exists with the Cubans,
that the problem with him (the Anerican) is that he does not know
anyone in Cuba and therefore if that is true it will be difficult
for him to get a visa for Cuba, because. he was thinking of proces -
sing his visa (for the Soviet Union), because he knew it would
require waiting a long time for his visa to the Soviet Union while
in Cuba, and fron there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet said
the thing is that if his wife right now were in Washington she
would receive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet
Union, to return to her country, she is going to receive her visa in
Washington but having this visa, she could communicate to any place
this permission, for example here or any place she could receive it
(visa or permission), but right now they do not have them.

Silvia DURAN says certainly and they cannot give a letter either
because they do not know if the visa will be approved. The Soviet
says he cannot give a letter or recommendati on either because he
does not know him (the American) and asks to be excused for

bothering her. Silvia DURAN says that is all right and many thanks.

c. 28 September 1963 (Saturday), 1151 hours Mexico City time.

Silvia DURAN calls the USSR Embassy and talks to an unidentified

number, down--Silvia DURAN then says the Anerican citizen is going

to talk with you, i.e., the Soviet. The American first spéaks

Russian and the Soviet speaks English. They continue in English.

17. Summing up, we can state, or by free interpretation reasonably
infer fron the intercept evidence, that OSWALD made or could have made
the following contacts with the Cuban and Soviet. official establishments

in Mexico City.
'

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday). After’ arrival and check-in to
his hotel, OSWALD went first. to the Cuban Enbassy where he: talked
with Mrs.. Silvia DURAN. The time of his.first Cuban Enbaésy visit.

i that seemed to have relevance. These have not been included in this
: summary because they appear, on review, to be excludable fron the OSWALD
: matter on logical or substantive grounds, or both, bearing in mind that
the Soviet Embassy received many calls pertaining to visa matters.

On the 27th at 1037 hours the Soviet Embassy received a call from
i an unknown individual speaking Spanish who said he wanted visas to go to
ie Odessa. He was told the Consul was not in and to call back at 1130.
at OSWALD is: known to have arrived at the Flecha Roja bus terminal on bus
#516 at circa 1000 hours on the 27th. It was, therefore, possible for
him to have made this call. But granting this, it is unreasonable to
believe the calls were OSWALD's for the following reasons:

| a. The caller wanted visas, and specifically for Odessa.
eae OSWALD was seeking a visa and never in any context did he specify
the Black Sea port of Odessa as a destination.

There was no photographic coverage. of OSWALD's entries
into either the Cuban or Soviet Embassies on the 27th. The lack of
coverage on the Cuban installation is explainable: the camera,
based on the recollection of officers stillin service in Head-
quarters, was down on the. 27th because of mechanical malfunction,
which was in course of correction. why OSWALD was missed “in his
probable entry to the Soviet installation‘on the 27th is fot yet
explained, but no technical operation of that kind is infallible.

b. 28 September 1963 (Saturday). [Note: Both the Cuban and

Soviet Embassies were closed to the public on Saturdays. Photo-

graphic coverage was normally suspended Saturdays and Sundays .]

b. The call was.directed to the correct. Soviet consular
number: 15-60-55... On 1 October, OSWALD first called the wrong
number, 15-69-87 (the MA's number), and had to redirect his call to
the correct number, 15-60-55. It seems unlikely he would have made
what would have been his initial call, on Friday the 27th, to the
correct number, and called the incorrect number on 1 October.

c. There is every reason to believe from the context of the
intercepts, para 15, a-e above, that OSWALD's first destination
after arrival and check-in to his hotel, was a visit to the Cuban
Embassy.

d. The use of the Spanish language would exclude OSWALD unless
he made use of an intermediary, which seems unlikely from what is
known of his modus operandi.

On 3 October at 1539 hours an individual speaking broken Spanish,

then English, called the Soviet Embassy and asked for a visa. The Soviet.
respondent says: Call on the other phone. The requestor says: I'm

OSWALD, notwithstanding the holiday schedule, went .on Saturday
morning to the Soviet Embassy (his second visit) where he spoke to —
a Consut. He apparently could not recall his new Texas address. :
At circa 1151 hours he went to the Cuban Embassy--his third entry--
where he had registered it in his visa application the day
previously. He secured the address from Mrs DURAN and she called
the Soviet Consulate presumably to permit:him to give them “the
address over the phone. Instead, the Soviet with whom OSWALD spoke
over Mrs. DURAN's telephone invited OSWALD to cone back in person,
and he said he would immediately. Presumably, thereupon OSWALD vent

looking for a visa to'go to Russia. The Soviet says: Please call on the
telephone of the Consul, 15-60-55. The requestor says: One moment
please, I'l] have to get a pencil to write the number down. They issue
the visa there? The Soviet: That depends on your conversation. I don't
know about this business. The requestor asks for the number again. The
Soviet gives him the number and tells him to ask for the Consul of the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

The relevance of this intercept to OSWALD is excludable on three
grounds:

a. The use of broken Spanish. OSWALD throughout used broken
Russian or English. He had no competance in Spanish to handle a
conversation of this kind.

b. The substance of the request indicates a visa request in
the first stages of initiation. OSWALD had developed his matter

with the Cubans and the Soviets the previous Saturday to a point
well beyond the stage indicated by the substance of this call.

at 1031 and. 1045 hours, to the Soviet Embassy. He identified himself
twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a guard--
and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV. There

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follow-
ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should be. From the context
ey of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to
the Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of
the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were
concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.
Under those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

would have gone to the Soviet Embassy on that date.

Soviet Embassy of a white-shirted individual who, in the opinion of the

only person--a non-Latin, and possibly an American--who entered the Soviet

identification data derived fron the voice intercept and the descriptive
data derived from the photograph, the Station reported the two elements

as separate facts in its cable to Headquarters on-8 October.

19. “The Station's action was not unusual and really amounted to an
analytic "quantum leap," justified by the primitive and initiatory status

(2) .It is believed that OSWALD may be identical
*to Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD, born.on 18 October 1939
in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine

who defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959

a. OSWALD's middle name was misgiven: “Henry” for Harvey.
The reason for this mistake is simplicity itself. The sheet opening. ,
the file on OSWALD on 9 December 1960 had been erroneous ly inscribed; a
"CSWALD, Lee Henry." That sheet--unchanged except for the notation of

the error--is still the first sheet-in the OSWALD file.
b. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: "“PUSAKOVA" for PRUSAKOVA.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the.

Headquarters communications throughout the month). More important was:

c.:.Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with
“a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual
observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked 7 to
Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,
“appeared to be an Anerican," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

There can be no question that ‘this misreading of the Mexico Station report
was ‘an analyst's error which escaped detection in the coordination before :
release: the descriptive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the
mark as to be immediately recognizable as suck by the recipients in Head-
quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photos of OSWALD. - (In partial
explanation, if not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that moment CIA

had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

the cable composed by the same analyst and sent as of 2209Z time (two

description should have been sufficient, in view of the incongruities

with the details deduced from the photo of the unidentified male, to
keep these two matters apart as investigative facts. But things did not

work out that way.

25. Mexico Station on 15 October 1963 asked Headquarters to
“please pouch a photo of OSWALD." Headquarters electrically delivered
i to the Department of the Navy the following message on 24 October 1963.

"Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD . . .

"It is requested that you forward to this office
: as soon as possible two copies of the most recent

photograph you have of subject. We will forward

them to our representative in Mexico, who will

No photo had been received by CIA by 22 November 1963.

26. Within its limitations and capabilities, Mexico Station had

all it could to comply with Headquarters instructions:

a. “Headquarters had been alerted, and Gn turn those agencies
with an investigative or policy interest jn OSWALD as an American
in the United States had been alerted, both in Washington and in
the. field. .

b. Mexico Station had no further contacts by OSWALD to ‘report
because--as it was ultimately ascertained--he had left Mexico City ‘

on 2 October.

“c¢. OSWALD was not an Agency investigative responsibility, in
any ‘case. Even with a photograph, it would have taken very special
efforts, ‘triggered by the other interested U.S. agencies, to have
made a positive identification in view of OSWALD's hotel registra-

tion under alias.

There the matter rested until mid-day 22 November 1963.

The Insertion of the Photo of the Unidentified Individual into the

Chain of Evidence .

27. On 22 November 1963 the Mexico Station cabled Headquarters at

2229Z time after learning of the arrest of Lee H. OSWALD, age 24,

23

possibly in connection with the assassination, and referenced its

earlier messages of 8-9 and.15 October and Headquarters’ reply of

10 October, The Station requested by:

: "priority pouch a photo of OSWALD so that Station

can check all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forward- .

ing ‘soonest copies of only visitor to Soviet Embassy

on1 October who could be identical with OSWALD."

28. “It is clear that Mexico Station had forgotten that according
to its own communication the unidentified male in the photo was of
"apparent age 35" and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded
by Headquarters on 10 October precluded the identity with OSWALD of the
person whom they regarded as the “only visitor to the Soviet Embassy on

1 October who could be identical."

29. The Station meanwhile-had begun an exhaustive and accelerated
review of al] its technical and photographic intelligence. A dispatch
was prepared in accordance with the indication given in the cable of

22 November, cited in paragraph.25 above. The dispatch noted that

‘ photo coverage of the unidentified individual had turned up on 4 and

15 October at the Soviet and Cuban Embassies, respectively. The text
of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch read:

"1. Attached are copies of the only photographs

obtained . . . on 1 October 1963 which appeared

24

to be an Anerican. This same man visited the Soviet

Embassy on: 4 October 1963.

"2... Copies of ‘these photographs were shown-to the
U.S. Ambassador on 22 November 1963 and a copy of
each of the two photographs was given to Chief FBI,

Mexico, on that date. ...

"P.S. Photographs dated 15 October 1963 were
inserted after typing of dispatch. These were

taken as [the] person entered the. Cuban Embassy."

Attached were eight photographs: four (of which two were marked

} 1 October on reverse) showing the individual in a white shirt, and four
| (unmarked on reverse) showing the individual in a black shirt. It

1 would seem to be logical that the word “sets" was probably onitted from

paragraph two of the dispatch between the words “two" and “photographs.”

30. That the Station was working under forced draft is clearly
apparent from the text of the dispatch, which tacked on a material fact
+» as a postscript. That fact was reported simultaneously by cable to

Headquarters at 0053Z time, 23 November:

"1. Mexico Station has photos same unidentified

a E 31. Headquarters, at 0136Z time, 23 November 1963, asked Mexico
Station to send a staff member with al] photographs to Headquarters on
the next available flight.

32. Concurrently with or before the foregoing cables to Headquarters,
cae the Chief of Station, Mexico City, had spoken directly by double-talk
telephone with the Western Hemisphere Chief of Division, Mr. d. C. KING,
and secured permission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden-
tified individual to the Legal Attache and to make them known to the

Ambassador.

33. What happened next is best reflected in.a personal note by the °
Chief of Station to the WH Division Chief, mailed to the latter fron
Dallas, together with copies of the photographs, by the Legal Attaches

representative who delivered them to the FBI in that city.
: "22 November 1963

34. The decision to remit the photographs to the FBI in Dallas

simultaneously with the FBI agent's departure reported to’ Headquarters:

by cable (0244Z time, 23 November):

35. Headquarters responded two hours later, 0422Z time,

23 November 1963, cancelling its request:

"1. No need send staffer with photos. We have

asked Navy for photos again, but Mexico can see

OSWALD's picture soonest on the press wire.

"2. Have just ré-emphasized to FBI Headquarters.

On the 23rd at 17292 time,. Headquarters’ advised Mexico City:

"The FBI says that the photos .of the man

entering the Soviet. Embassy which Mexico

Station’ sent to Dallas were not of Lee OSWALD.
Presume Mexico Station’ has double-checked
dates of these photos and is also checking all

pertinent photos for possible shots of OSWALD."

And .at this point, 2048Z time, 23 November, Mexico Station

finally agreed:

38.

~ reported

"Saw photos of Lee OSWALD on television. night of
22 November and it obvious photos sent to Dallas
were not identical with Lee OSWALD held in Dallas.

Dates are as given on photos.

"Mexico Station is reviewing all available photos

of persons entering Soviet and Cuban Embassies."

Two hours later (22542 time, 23 November 1963) the Station had

the results of its effort to review all available coverage:

29

"Complete recheck..of photos of al] visitors to

November against good press photos shows no
evidence of OSWALD visit. Similar blank against
all Soviet Embassy photos fron 1 September.

Note, only visit we know he made to Cuban Embassy

28 September, Saturday, on.which Embassy closed

and we had not had coverage... .

39. With this communication the matter of the “unidentified :
individual" reaches ‘the end of Phase I, the key element of which is the
conviction, at first latent, then expressed, that the photographed
individual might be identical with OSWALD. This applies especially to
the Station, though at a certain point even Headquarters moved no
rebuttal despite the hard fact that the description of OSWALD and the —

unidentified individual were quite disparate.

40. This review has attempted to deal even-handedly with all items
in the case record that have a bearing on what happened. The operational
zeal, innovativeness, and the high committment of all involved,
especially in Mexico City, speaks for itself. Equally apparent--
because of the 20/20 advantage of hindsight--is the evidence of
non-performance. It was a critical failure, for example, that no photo
of OSWALD was made available--though it was expressly requested both at

Headquarters and by the field--or that it was not more aggressively

sought by CIA, before 22 November. A photograph of OSWALD would have
obviated--in 7 way the mere possession of a correct physical description
evidently could not--the. whole successive deterioration of what began in
Mexico City as an impressionistic selection of the photograph on

* - :
1 October 1963 into a cause celebre today.

40. It. should be clear from this factual: survey that never had
there been a cause celebre with less intrinsic merit. It is equally
clear from the facts themselves that there was nothing contrived or
conspired in what happened, unless we have now descended to that point
in human values achieved under STALIN in the USSR and under HITLER in

Germany, where just a plain mistake is per se evidence of conspiracy.

The Genesis and Development of Odum Exhibit No. 1 and

Commission Exhibit 237

41. Special Agent of the FBI, Bardwell D. ODUM, on 23 November
1963 showed one of the six photos flown up from Mexico City the previous
day to OSWALD's mother, Marguerite OSWALD. ODUM himself had trimmed off
the background by straight cuts. Mrs. OSWALD had no recognition of the

image in the photograph. ODUM's own detailed account may be found in

Hearings, op cit, Vol. XX, p. 268.

42. The photograph shows the unidentified individual in a black

shirt. It was one of the five photos taken of him in front of the Soviet
31

SECRET


heer : SiesCiReeaT

‘Embas sy in Mexico City on 4 October 1963, two days after OSWALD had
left the city.

43. At this point, for the record, the total available photo

coverage of the unidentified individual numbers twelve (12). photographs:

a: Five (5) taken on 1 October 1963, entering and exiting the
Soviet. Embassy. He is garbed in a white. shirt and light-colored

(khaki-2) trousers.

b. Five (5) taken on 4 October 1963 in front of the Soviet
Embassy. He is garbed in'a dark, open, button-down shirt with a

high-neckline undershirt showing and dark trousers.

c. .-Two (2) taken on 15 October 1963 in front of the Cuban

Embassy. He is wearing a dark, collarless T-shirt or light sweater.

The negatives of all of these_are extent and are now held in Headquarters

as integral parts of the OSWALD and related file holdings.

44. The result. of ODUM's display of the photograph--to repeat, a
+ -cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 43b, above--was

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of

her son's killer, Jack RUBY, a day before he perpetuated the deed! Again
the Warren Commission Report (pp. 364-365, 367) exhaustively disposes
of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-
ting fact developed along the way was Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) observati on,

32

SECRET


SECRET

when she finally admitted before the Commi ssion that the ODUM photograph
was not RUBY, was that.the photo had been cropped differently from the
one she had been shown in Dallas. Inspector MALLEY's cropped version of
the ODUM photograph became Commission Exhibit 237 (see Hearings,

Vol. XVI, p. 638). ae

45. The net effect of the developments in the hearings of the

Commission was to require the admission of the ‘cropped photogr‘ ph into
evidence tn a chain of depositions beginning with ODUM, including the
FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph used by
the Commission in Washington), and Richard HELMS, who deposed for: the
originator. These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly.
advised against the publication of the. photograph in _ form on the
grounds that the Soviets would be immediately alerted to the existence
of a useful and continuing U.S. intelligence operation, and the opera~
tion would go down the drain. There were repeated cables exchanged on
this point between Headquarters and Mexico Station during the summer
of 1964, in particular fron 23 September to 15 October 1964 when the

Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

47. In acceding to the Commission's request for a deposition,

Mr. HELMS, then the Deputy Director for Plans, replied affirmatively to
33

SECRET

i

SECRET

Mr. RANKIN by memorandum of 23 June 1964 which included the following

additional observation:

“"The Central Intelligence Agency recommends that
' this photograph not be reproduced in the Commis-
sion's report because it would jeopardize a most
confidential. and productive operation. In
addition, it could be embarrassing to the indivi-
-dual ‘involved who as far as the Agency is aware
_had no connection with Lee Harvey OSWALD or the

assassination of President KENNEDY."

48. In this instance the needs of the Commission prevailed over
the DCI's statutory obligation.to protect sources and methods. The
“Unidentified Individual" remains to this day unidentified and there is
no credible evidence up to this time to rebut the assertion made by
Mr. HELMS in the concluding sentence of his memorandum to Mr. RANKIN on
23 June 1964. And the operation did, as predicted, go down-the drain.
Within a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. 1 and
Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet -Embassy began systematic
efforts to survey the surrounding buildings, ostensibly for rental
space, but clearly their inquiries were directed to spotting possible
camera sites. The operation was continued in any case. Within a year
it had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Americans in
contact with the Embassy--a clear sign that this category of visitor

was being warned away bythe Soviets themselves.

Phase III: The "Unidentified Man" Photographs, 1964 - 1975

49. As could be foreseen, there has been persistent Pressure by
critics of the Warren Commission Report, to exploit Odum: Exhibit No. 1.
ands Conmissi on Exhibit No. 237 for partisan interpretive purposes. A
considerable correspondence has accumulated since the end of 1964 in
which the Agency has attempted to be responsive to these requests. and,

simultaneously, has tried to satisfy what has been its sole interest

: from the inception of the matter: to protect the method of acquisition

tionship)which made the

of the photograph (and the f

acquisition possible.

50. Following are highlights from the correspondence during the

current phase.

| On 16 May 1967, over the signature.of the General Counsel
of the Agency, Lawrence R. HOUSTON, CIA voluntarily submitted a
statement about the photograph to Judge BAGERT of the Criminal
District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana.
The response dealt affirmatively with the contents of the subpoena
that had been delivered to the United States Marshall in.the District
of Columbia, despite the fact that the subpoena could not be ;
executed because of the lack of jurisdiction.

Mr. HOUSTON proferred on Agency behalf categoric assur-

ances to the court regarding the inaccuracy of statements and
35

inferences made by Mr. GARRISON in New Orleans about the photograph

of the unidentified individual. The following is extracted from

Mr. HOUSTON's memorandum.
. "Because of the publicity which has surrounded the
Orleans Parish Grand Jury proceedings ; we have

recently carried out an exhaustive search of the

“files of the Central Intelligence Agency for any

“picture of Lee Harvey OSWALD taken in Mexico. As

a result of this search, I can state. categorically. ©

that the files of this Agency do not contain, and

never have contained, any such picture of

Lee Harvey OSWALD taken in Mexico and that we have
no information whatsoever that any such photograph ;
ever existed. To the best of our knowledge and
informati on, therefore, there is no such photograph.
Furthermore, the photograph which is printed in the
Warren Commission Report, Exhibit No. 237 in Volume
XVI, never contai ned more than one figure, and the
figure in the photograph depicts an individual who,

to our knowledge, has not been identified. The

circumstances of the filing of this photograph with
the Warren Commission are set forth in affidavits

of any photograph that answers in any way the :

description of the one we understand was requested :

in the subpoena.

"T-hope you will accept this information in ‘this
form.in the spirit of cooperation in which it is

proferred."

b. © The Agency has repeatedly serviced requests about the
identify of the unknown individual from Mr. Emory L. BROWN,” Jr. ,
Route #4, Box 82, Squankum Road, Farmingdale, New “Jersey. The last
exchange of correspondence in our record covered the period

4 - 17 April 1970.

c. Detailed inquiries on the unidentified individual were
received on 1 and ad November 1971, to hi ch. the Agency responded
on. 15 November and 4 December, respectively, from

Mr. Paul L. HOCH, 1735 Highland Place #2, Berkeley, California.

d. The most extensive effort to pursue the unidentified
individual was and is being made by Bernard FENSTERWALD, dr who
is now Executive Director of a Committee to Investigate Assassina-
tions, 927 55th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., beginning on
22 March 1971, shortly after the Agency declassified Commission
Document No. 674, and extending through 11 October 1972, after the

FBI's declassification of Commission Document No. 556. On 8 April

1971, Mr. FENSTERWALD was invited. to the Agency for a discussion

with the General Counsel, Mr. HOUSTON, of his question about. the ©
photograph of the unknown individual. Two-other photographs of

Hl : the unidentified individual, in addition to the photograph

4 : : depicted in the two Commission exhibits, were shown to him at that
i time. «It is a matter of more than ordinary interest to note that

on this occasion Mr. FENSTERWALD, who was accompanied by his

partner, Mr. Willian OHLHAUSEN, told Mr. HOUSTON and another

“representative of the Agency in attendance that he knew who the

unidentified man was. The following is extracted from Mr. HOUSTON's

Memorandum of Record, 8 April 1971:

ak Fe tr. FENSTERWALD came to my office this
morning with his partner, William G. OHLHAUSEN,
looked at the other photographs, and told us he
oi did know who. the man was. . He said he is presently
serving a prison term somewhere in the United
’ States and admitted that he had known OSWALD, but
: Mr. FENSTERWALD said there was nothing to indicate
any connection between the man in the photographs
and the assassination of President KENNEDY.
Mr. FENSTERWALD did not give us the man's name at
‘this time, as he said enough people had suffered

unnecessarily from allegations that they were

associated with the assassination, but he did
say he was sure we had a file on the man. He
asked if he could have the photographs, and I
asked how he could use them. He said he did
not know and finally agreed that for the time
being he would not press his request. nid otis

The whole meeting was extremely friendly and

they thanked us for our response."

The following is extracted from the Memorand

by the other CIA man present, Mr. Arthur E. DOOLEY.

"Mr. FENSTERWALD said he knew who the person
was and had spoken.to him; that the man was too
nervous to come forth on his own. FENSTERWALD
would not give the man's name but said he is an
American, serving a prison term in this country
on a criminal charge, and that he had met OSWALD
in Mexico. I asked whether the prisoner had any
conspiratorial relationship with OSWALD.
FENSTERWALD replied he did not know the answer
as he had not interviewed the man as yet. We
reiterated that we did not know who the man
was, and said that we would like.to know his
identity. FENSTERWALD replied that CIA has a

of the "Unidentified Individual ," though the claim, if true, would
be of direct evidential interest and possibly permit us to assert
