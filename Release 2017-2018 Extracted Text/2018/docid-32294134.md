ABRAM D. ARMSTEAD, graduate, Howard University

Medical School, Washington,

whose license to practice

medicine was suspended as a

two abortion patients per weel and, at the present time, he

is averaging about two abortions a month.

ARMSTEAD stated that of late he has been almost

wholly oscupied with the job of handicapping and betting

and prior to the

bombing-murder of VINCENT J. DE NIRO

(7/17/61), he placed his bets through DE NIRO and always was

paid when

he won,

After the death of DE NIRO, CAVALIARO moved

into DE NIRO's operation, and he won about $2,000 or $3,000

on horse bets and could not collect.

Some time after this

he was held up by one JOE (LNU), a pickup man Ior CAVALLARO,

who, with another individual, took about $200 or $300 from him.

ARMSTEAD stated he definitely knew that CAVALLARO

moved into DE NIRO's operation and, for this reason, believed

that CAVALLARO was at least partially responsible for the death

Of DE NIRO.

PCI ANN GARMAN advised that about two or three weeks

before DOMINICK MOIO was found, murdered at Canton, Ohio (9/3/53),

she saw and talked with MOlo at the Center Sandwich Shop,

Youngstown, Ohio, operated by the NAPLES brothers, where

he

was talking with JOSEPH and JIMMIE NAPLES.

She recognized

While she

did not know his name before, she recalled that in 1961 and

1962 she saw MOIO in the company of BILLY NAPUSS (bombing-murder

victim, 7/1/62). PCI thought it odd that MOIO was with the

NAPLes brothers, inasmuch as there has been much talk that

MOIO was responsible for the death of BILLY NAPLES. PCI heard

gone out of

town to meet MOIO and now believes that the NAPLES brothers

were pretending to be friendly with MOIO by not blaming him

for the death of BILlY NAPLES, so they could maneuver him into

a position to kill him.
