1. Subject seems to hsve inherited thet particular
Latin American peachant for involvenent in covert political
activities. However, the Subdject's involvement is not merely
: neatina ny verresrion but it is instand intimaraly connacted
with his chosen crofession as an arms sal n. Here the
phrase “for fun asd profit" seems aptly suited. He seens
to be a man of action with the ability to exploit an oppor-
tunity, rather tan a towering intellect.

2. Subse excellent contacts and access in
Latin America. is access developed from his extended
family, professional appainggents, ané:his Savoivgnent with
WSN oxbig eporty Gis fasily 49 well-known (ingenous)
of roueheut wdny futtors of Latin Axprica'and @pens many doors '
! for him (althougs it also closes others}. It should also

b be mentioned that. ais family his recently developed a rather :
checkered associstion with this Agency. The particular i j |
nature of his military products gives him contact with higd |

H : military, police. and socurity officials throughout Latia
America. He seeps to be well versed on the status of various
aras deals (both official and under-the-table) in the
countries he travels. He has been involved with several
Cuban exile pol 1 and p military organizations.

3. Politically, Subject is a staunch anti-Communist.
This position 4s probably ingrained from his family, but
also reinforced from his various political and professicnal
activities. He sas voiced e particuler hatred for Cuban
.Communists. He seeas to view them not as respected enemies,
but as hated traitors. He is vehemently anti-Castro.

1. _Ploase be informed of a possible future contact~-Rolando

MASFERRER, Jr., recently promoted to Vice-President of Sales, Mili~
tary Armament Corporation, Washington D.C, office, 905 L' £nfant
Plaza, #4020. He is also associated with Parabellum Corporation,
another military weapons firm, Subject, born approximately 1945,
ip Habana, Cuba, is believed to be a naturalized citizen.

2.. Subject makes frequent Sales trips to Latin America. Because

Of INS wabdie of Mls nein pouch biaviiiue plelvic whi esiemese) i

has good access to top Latin Ansrican governmental officials and
military and security officers, He has personally met many Latin
Anerican presidents, He should b2 a good sour: of information on
the current status of arms sales in Latin America; internal security,
military armament levels, order-of-battle, and internal politics in
host countries; and, if needed, status of Cuban exile movement. He
is presently on a sales mission to Colombia and is scheduled to return
in mid-June. :

3. MASFERRER, Jr. has been a Miami resident since 1959 and more
recently lived in Atlanta. He will permanently locate in’ hace Washing-
ton, D.C, area when he returns from his Colombian trip.

4. Subject is not to be confused with his father by the same
mame, the infamous Rolando Arcadio MASFERRER y Rojas (201-42669).
Masferrer Sr. was a former Cuban Senator and leader of a dreaded .
private army of Batista enforcers called “Los Tigres(Th2 Tigers)".
He is presently serving in a U.S. federal prison for attempting

. to orgenize a 1967 invasion of Haiti in order to set up a base

of operations against Cuba. Masferrer Sr., violently anti-Castro,
was involved in numerous Cuban exile operations against Cuba during -
bed last decade. :

5. Iwas Subject's Commanding Officer in the Florida National
Guard and sometimes saw him socially while in Miami, Although Cuban ©
by birth, he now feels that he is an American. Politically anti-
Communist,ne joined the National Guard(while not under duress from _
the draft) to become a "Green Beret,” He is polite and correct in
his social relationships, I received a letter from him, 7 June 1972,
informing me of bis impending move to the Washington, D.C, area. He

an iil : + cecoaey LES



solicited my aid in finding a local army reserve unit.

6. If you are interested in exploring this possibility further,

please feel free to contact me at any tine.

I could suggest cautions

and method of contact or introduction, Subject is unwitting of ny

Agency employment,

MEHORANDUM FOR THE RECORD i f7-1088 16 ;

SUBJECT: Assessment of Recruitability - Rolando Masferrer, Jr. . |
‘"" Vice-President, Sales, Military Armanent Corporation |
and Associated with De: @ Systews—tncorporated ~~
i fise76a.-
“S12, Subject seems to have inherited that particuler - ~
Latin American penchant for involvement in covert political
activities. However, the Subject's involvement is not noreiv
pratima ae rect = bul 2c as ansceaa intimately connected
. with his choson profession as an aras salesman. Here the
phrase "for fun and profit" seens aptly suited. He seens

to be a man of action with the ability to exploit an oppor-
tunity, rather than a towering inteliect.

é --° 2. Subject has excellent contacts and access in
seas Latin America. This access developed from his extended
: fanily, professional appgingpontas angshis Savolwanent with. |
X INES oxbta grees ¢ “is favtiy we known (infamous)
of N hrougne:

ut Bény Settors of Latin AwdP%ica‘fnd Gpens wany doors
for hin (although it also closes others). It should also

an be mentioned that his fanily has recently developed a rather
checkered association with this Agency. The particular . H {

Rature of his military products gives hia contact with high q

military, police, aad security officials throughout Latin i

Amotica. He seems to be well versed on the stetus of various

eras deals (both official and under-the-table)} in the

countries he travels. He has been involved with several

Cuban exile political and para-nilitary organizations.

¢ Politically. Subject 1s a staunch anti-Communist.

This: position {1s probably ingrained from his family, but

» glso reinforced from his various political and professional
etivities, He has voiced a particular hatred for Cuban

Communists. He seems to view thed not as respected enenies,

but as hated traitors. He is vehemently anti-Castro.



4, Subject has developed what could bg interpreted
as a certain patriotis: for this country. During conver-
sations he referred a few tines to “my country" neaning
the U.S, I believe that.the Fact he volunteered fer U.S.
nilitary training reflects not only the selfish notives
cf Leconing Special Forces qualified hut also a sense of
duty. I atso bulieve that his recent statements to ne
regarding intornation3i security matters is not rerely
enpty. loquacity but is evidence of h&s cesire to contribute
soneti:ing and beccne involved in the national interest.

S$. Subject would noed sober briefings on the
responsibility of any Agency association as well as subse- :
. quent careful handling. ile would need to get away fron
the “Flagler Street Connando syndrome" cf visual and verbal
bravado. le would neeé instruction to discern ruxor from
fac yy qeuerrea and to assess the reliability
of acquired information. . :

6. I an sure.that the Subjegt is recruitable. The
question is what degree of asscciagion with the Agency
would be appropriate. If the 4ecigion is made to approach H
the Subject, may I suggest that hig association be initially i
linited to Agency briefings and debriefings before and after Hl
his-trips to Latin Anerica. cace his reliability is established :

:

and the accuracy of his reporting is proven then further i
utiiization may be possible. Since his financial situation
seems to be secure If am sure he could be handled on a non-
pay. basis. ‘i

“27. Subject. is scheduled to leave on a two-week business
trip.to Vonezusla and Colombia beginning in early August 1972.
