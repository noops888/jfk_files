Meorandum of Conversation, Dan
tla ther/Les Midgley and the DCI,
Dated 6 September 1975

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and that<flave crept up every so often
since then. In one form or. fast x, the allegations are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD had/® eee Sten connected with the Agency.
The allegations are ee rounded.

o

2. The facts Ce tter are as follows: !

a. On 2 bs mbe i 3 I was instructed by
Mr. R.G.Roct ipitiediwlte superior at that time, to
make a tho: checkSjithin the Agency at Headquarters
to determin e @ Harvey OSWALD had ever been
used by the Agenc\(or been connected with it in any
conceivable way. ordered me to make the checks
directly and personally to the degree possible and not
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R.
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

|
Agency's key contact officials with the Warren |
Commission. ;

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index |
of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I j
rechecked the Main Index and found no“record beyond i
that which I had already obtained.beéfore (plus. those {
items which had been integrated into the- records system i

since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO
xecoras which indicated any Agency connection with

|
OSWALD. i

of their ae stations, I was told, and the
results were negative.

4. I recall very clearly that we were extremely
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American: returning
from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by
Deb, thus having established contact with the Agency.

The same point has now, quite understandably, been made

by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid
reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time. |
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before |
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite
uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in
those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade @ were so many persons travelling to
and from the So inion that DCD was incapable of talk-
ing to all of fhem Therefore, a program of selectivity

and ape oreo Riera: was instituted. In

light of th@S seems to me that OSWALD-- if he H
at all--would have easily been i
simply did not possess the type of

D was seeking at that time. DCD would
ts limited manpower on travellers who !
ack gpeater access in the USSR.

ce be added that my above-described

search in Agency file holding produced no record or
indication that any other US Government agency had used !
him as a source or had considered him for recruitment. i

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J, EDGAR HOOVER
26 November 1963 ~ 11:20 a.m, oo

Da: I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

Ht We have had the very best support that we could possibly
expect from you.

DCI: Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

Fi We will feel free to do that

Da: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on ‘you to
make it.

H: We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various
wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question
that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i Mexico City.
We have now found that the: photograph that was ta cen was not
that of Oswald. We do find from our informant dovm there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has -
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him
the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wold take three
weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

DCI: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there. We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.
Katee heck

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned
in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that |
has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc. '
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the .
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be i
sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in andit i
is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said :
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make. :

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the baslt issues or
positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the
Commission. For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission
would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements
might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they
will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-
spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates
that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous
interviews. I xakged with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent
information whit are processing which originated with the
sensitive WHsource. I informed him that in your view this would

they use the. cover of being scholarship students supported by the Cuban government.
The DSI supplied them clothes, food, and every sort of care, such as medical and
any other kind. The DGI takes care of their general expandsege tae

Ordinarily Rag an attempt is mde to keep then from contact with may anyone in’
goverment circles soas to avoid indiseretionse Any agent recruited in a foroign
country is brought to Cuba and arrangements are made so that he has no contacts
with persons in Cuba from his om country or any other. Once his. training is
completed, his departure from Cuba is not made known to anyoue abtached to him.

In recruitment of Cubans, an effort is made to find those knowing the fewest
possible persons. “If the Cuban who is recruited is employed in an office or
factory or works soite other place, an effort is made to have him continue his
work so as to use his situation to provide true cover; instruction is given ab
hours when he is not working. If the ager has any trouble after he has been
recruited, the DGI tries to helo him as much as possible without breaking dom
conpartentation or his covers

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the DGI covers the ex-
penses of his family. If a Cuban who is recruited is unemployed, it looks for
@ cover adapted to his situation, and the NGI tates care of all the expenses
the agent has, including those of his family if he is married. He receives his
training in the hours adapted to bis cover position. His life, like that of the
agent who is working, mst contime normal, just as it was before recruitmente

Mr. Coleman added that we hoped in all this to be

We wanted both him and Mr. Anderson there, if possible, both as

: interpreters and because their previous personal acquaintance

with the Secretary would facilitate cur dealings. Scott tcle-
phoned Anderson and confirmed this request.

We then reentered our discassion of the assassination
in general, as 1t related to Mexico. It appeared that the CIA
ctirfauirington-hednat foruirded certain material developed
elsewhere to Scott, even though these materials might have
reasonably related to the Mexican investigations. For example,

Embassy after he returned toa the United States, describing

The three of us were driven by Rolfe Larson in an

unmarked automobile around the various points that had been
touched upon by Oswald. We saw the Transportes del Norte bus
terminal, the Transportes Frontera bus terminal, the Plecha

del Comercio, the restaurant next door to the hotel where

Oswald repowtedly ate many meals, otier hotels in the neighbor-
hood of the Hotel Gel Comercto and tne vartana hua atationa:
and this netghborhood generally, the Cuban Embassy and

Consulate, and the Russian Embassy and Consulate.

Stveral observations were immediately obvious. The
two embassies are close enough together so that Oswald almost

certainly walked back and forth between them when the occasion

ecselled for it. The embassies, although theoretically reachable

from the Hotel del Comercio or the inter-city bus stations by

local bus, are in practice so lccated that reaching them by
bus would be much too RB a oO was not familiar

The hotels near this particular bus terminal are almost all

it would seem very possible that Oswald could have been

that it was upon the information his men had obtained from her

Osborne, being a person under suspicion and being an alien, is
told that he must come into a certain police station and report

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

This seems so because:
a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or

2. Bo you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet

husbarid?.. D :

4. Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald,
"that same afternoon," came back "again" to the Cuban
Enbassy. Does this mean that he was there twice the same
day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous
day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the
Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this i
sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed information i
found in the subsequent paragraphs. In general, we would u

6. Reference is made
subparagraph gf paragraph 12b. Is there any significance
to the word, “Although”? We wonder whether the informant
meant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran
reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued
to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

7. Refermce is again made to the 2nd subparagraph of
paragraph 12b. our letter states that Mrs. Duran told the
Soviet Embassy” that Oswald"knew no one in Cuba} and that
the Soviet official “echoed her statement that the American
_ Was not known.” It is unclear to us whether this discussion
. 4nvolved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet
officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not knowing

anyone in the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies.

8. Reference is made to paragraph 12c. Was the "direct
conversation” between one of the members of the Soviet
Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was
at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that
Mrs. Duran sent Oswald personally over to the Soviet teeta

9. Reference is again made to paragraph l2c. Could
you clarify the many references to the "address" veferred to
80 frequently in this paragraph?

lo. qmmroughout your entire letter the term "Soviet
Consulate” seems, to be used interchangeably with the term
"Soviet Embassy," Likewise with “Cuban Consulate” and
"Cuban Embassy." We assume from this that the Soviet
Consulate and the Soviet Set ust be the same in Mexico

27 JUN (963

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence
SUBJECT: QowIn

1. Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make
the following recommendations concerning the further handling
and possible disposition of QJWIN:

a. I believe the original purpose for which
QJWIN was continued and sent to his present under-

cover tify te Aan BUCA dient validity
to justify the : yond the
termination of his present contract for this purpose
-_ PROGIENIED

b. QgWIN, i RO Rl competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles
in Europe where we have very few assets. Whether this
is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends
on the determination of how he can be used either by *
the German Statio: x BY, he Austrian Station or by
any other KUBARK ‘as a long term unofficial
cover agent. He is not being used at the present time.
He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any
operational assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of
Station Luxembourg and RABNEY be consulted by
Headquarters for their best recommendations as to
the continued use of QUWIN. After these recommendations
are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian
stations be consulted for their possible interest in
using him. If after these discussions a sensible

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sonetime in Summer 1960 -~

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the layang

on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable channels. At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his famity 0/2 aoe

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival. . 7
2, I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck >

me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

the information we need, because this individual looks odd." | We were

particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on the Minsk

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers. .

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually
divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning “home”.
‘The AEOCEAN 3 case. was among the first of these, and we eventually turned °
up something like two dozen similar cases, We established links between
some of these women and the KGB, KUDESK became interested in the developing
trend we had come ucross, {It was partly out of curiosity to learn if
Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of
interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational
intelligence interest in thectarves story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Repgrt conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that °
effort.

The lists fall into the foliowing sections:

£.1 Dissemination to the Intelligence Community .
E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission
£.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.
