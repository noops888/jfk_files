at headquarters, 831 Main Street, Buffalo,
New York. Jeanette Merrill was nominated
Chairman.

"Bob Sterling spoke regarding a
recent debate between Mark Lane and an
individual named Ball (phonetic) at an unnamed
university regarding the involvement of Lee
Harvey Oswald in the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. Sterling said that the
opinions of Ball relative to Oswald being the
assassin were absurd. He said.Lane's arguements
