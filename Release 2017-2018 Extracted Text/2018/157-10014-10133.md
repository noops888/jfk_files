PROCEEDINGS

The Chairman. We will soon have a quorum. Why don't
we begin with the Recommighidation No. 43 on page 77, having

to do with academics. A
My understanding ca that this recommendation has been

redrafted along the lines! of the Committee's recommendations, and

as it now stands it calls| for the CIA academies and the

institution to be informed, and for any student being peceaieed
to be so informed.

There is a choice in! the latter case in informing him
before he is paid or informing him before he leaves the U.S.
Will you explain that to ee please?

Mr. Aaron. In the course of our discussion about the
Pecrulenent of students off campuses, there were two cate-

L
gories of concern. One was for the integrity of the institu-

tions themselves, and the}second was, in turn, for the

students that might be involved.

To take the second one first, the Committee received

The Chairman. which |do you think the Committee should

adopt of these two optic:

Mr. Aaron. Actually; one could use both of these. I think

the point is that the danger to the student, if there is any,

comes when he. leaves Geol eee States, either to return to

Np
: he
his own country or. perhaps someplace else, but the commitment

or involvement which ought to be witting really needs to come
wh

when he starts being paid, when he becomes in fact, or has

a real relationship withi'the Agency. You could really estabiisy

both standards, because jit might well be that he could leave

the country but not havellyjet been paid, and not really have

ln

a relationship that was anything more than kind of an asso-

ciation or an option, sontning of that character.

Mr. Maxwell. Billl would this prohibit the use of any

Senator Tower. This is a question I wanted to ask,

Could one of our networks pick up a portion of a film

broadcast abroad by the CIA and run it as part of a documentary
to show what they are doing and that kind of thing?

The Chairman, I think the way it has been modified that
is not a problem. This says "by statute the CIA should be

prohibited from subsidizing writings," or production.

changes, the role of tne bez on page 61..

Mr. Aaron. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. We have one other
question, that would be Recommendation 47. The Committee
agreed to extend --

Mr. Kirbow. Excuse me, Mr. Aaron. Senator Mathias's
question was on recommendation 44.

The Chairman. Were you satisfied with the answer?

Senator Mathias. Well, the question that was left
floating was what Spout a student who is in a program which is
primarily funded by some private institution, although there
may be some small element ee

Mr. Maxwell. For instance, any major university that
sponsored an ‘individual coming under 44, which receives

Federal Government funds, might be barred under a broad
reading of 44, and it might be helpful to make that intente
clearer in 44, if that js a concern of the Committee.

source, but if he is a grantee of a Federal program --

Mr. Maxwell. But the problem is receiving funds through
educational and/or cultural programs.

For instance, if he were totally funded by the University
of Maryland, which received financial support from the United
States Government, arguably he is covered by that. It is not
that he is receiving Federal grants. I think that is the
intention.

Mr. Bader. I'm sorry, sir?

Mr. Aaron. Well, let me see-if I understand the different
examples. The student leader grant or the political leader
grant that the State Department has where they bring foreigners
to the United States sokl & period of time, presumably to
acquaint them with the country and what have you, under this
language those people while on the grant would be immune from
béing recruited by the CIA. This doesn't mean that they
couldn't recruit them at some other point in their careers, put |
that during the period of that grant they would not be in
effect brought here andi kgea for that purpose. That is, I
think, part of the pees this particular provision.

Senator Mathias. ‘Let me give you another example. Say

t

you have an Iranian naval officer who comes over here to

Fort McNair.

Is he fair game?

Mr, Miller. That is not educational or cultural. It
would be military.

Senator Schweiker. Can you exclude military training?

Senator Mathias. I don't know. TI don't know what you
want.

Senator Huddleston. We are training a lot of them or
we entertain a lot of them.

Senator Schweiker. It seems to me you have to put some
proviso about military training in there.

The Chairman. Well, it depends upon what the policy bee
be. I had thought the attempt here was to immunize any foreigng
who comes here on a program sponsored by the Government of the

|
United States and receives a grant for that program, to
immunize him during that period from being recruited by the
CIA. ay i

Senator Schweiker.’ |Well, if he is here for military
purposes, then we know it is a military relationship, I would
think that is suspect. { : 5

The Chairman. Would you want him subject to recruitment?

Senator Schweiker. Well, if he comes over here militarily,
you are so close to him, 'what is the difference?

i

Mr. Aaron. Well, I! think the point of the prohibition

really is this, that these programs are created for one

i
particular purpose. They are considered by the Congress for
‘

that particular purpose and the funds are voted for that

af particular purpose. If the programs are then used for another
2 purpose by the Government, that was considered and suggested
3 that that second purpose’ should not be used.
4 Now, if you want to; exempt certain categories here and
5 | say, well, the military is a different thing, you can do that.
6 You can find a way to express that.
7 Il The Chairman. Well, it could be done. If you want to
8 recruit foreign military officers, we can bring them over
9 to put them through the War College.
lo Mr. Miller, What other training?
aah Senator Huddleston.! Well, we have a steady stream at

15 I don't know, you know, military. Once a person puts on

The Chairman. Which part do you have?

Senator Tower. Well, not being able to use American
students abroad on some grant to gather intelligence, when
most of the people the damned Soviets send over here on these
cultural exchanges are really clued into the government
program, indoctrinated ,and briefed thoroughly before they get
here. I am not going éo|tie our hands like that. The rest
of .you can, but I'm not: going to.

I will write a vigorous dissent on that.

Senator Morgan. nay I make a comment on that?

I'm inclined to agree, and I'm also inclined to agree
that we are going so far in our foreign intelligence that
we are endangering the hove report, so you make that kind of

an argument on the floor of the Senate on this and on two or
rey ;
three other things. I'‘m/not picking at any of them, I am
ae :
just sort of accepting |the recommendations of the Subcommittee,

but my reaction has been|that maybe we are getting a little

bit so far afield that ‘we ‘may’ endanger the acceptance of our

Senator Huddleston. ; I would just say this, that the
Subcommittee has been eddnizant of that situation. I think it is
because of that that some of these recommendations are already

softer than some of feud would be appropriate, and this

is one of the fields. There was a considerable amount of suppoyt

of the idea that dcademics be off limits, period, and students
in order to protect the integrity of our entire academic
community, and it is the realization that if we continued to
close the possibilities! for recruitment, and the adverse
effect that that would have, maybe, on our ability to gather
‘A

intelligence, that some |of us backed off of this, what would

be the optimum, we think,! position to take. So this already
represents somewhat of a retreat from the principle that some
would like to see established, and’in this Gase I think we
jah

are again faced with the question of whether or not we want
a government-sponsored program to enjoy a high level of integrity
so that the people who die participating in it and the American
taxpayer who is supporting it can have some confidence that it
is doing what it was set out to do and what the publicly
announced purposes of it are. 7

And if we don't do that, if we permit it to be used as

an operational intelligence operation, then it seems to me like

we ought to’ announce that, that. that ought to be one of the
purposes so stated in the grant to start with, while we are
likely to. get an education, it is also likely if we can we

Senator Morgan. Let me finish out, now. What you are
leading up to is you are saying we are going to condition this
grant on your cooperation with other governmental .agencies.

Senator Huddleston. I am saying that is not beyond the
realm of possibility in some cases, if we don't put some
prohibition.

Senator Morgan. Well, I think there may be times,
especially in the light of what we heard in the past year,
when, you know, we might make that assumption, but I don't
think that on the waate when you are dealing with the United
States Government that you can really assume ae

Senator Hudddleston. But you can't assume he is not,

either.

The Chairman. But what worries me is you get.a student
who in good faith goes abroad for the purpose of study and
qualifies for a Government grant, and he depends upon that
money and then he, when he gets over there and wants to eee
his studies, he is approached, and he can be approached in
such a way that he can be made to feel that if he does not
throw in with the CIA and do this and that, he may. find that
the grant will be cut off or he can't complete.the study as he

intended. He feels a certain dependency upon the money that

And thus he is in a very vulnerable position when he is
approached.

Senator Morgan. Well, that is a persuasive argument, but
let me ask you, have we had any evidence that that sort of
thing has happened?

The Chairman. Well, I don't know.

Senator Morgan. Well, it is a very persuasive argument,
but I just wonder if we should, in the absence of abuse on
that part, whether or not we should go this far.

The Chairman. What about it, Mr. Bader?

Mr, Bader. Mr. Chairman, I might say in partial response
to Senator Tower's remarks that the Agency's basic instruction
for the operational use of individuals, 50-10, specifically
prohibits the a use of Fulbright grantees. They have
already made that Ferret in 1967, and reconfirmed in 1973.

I assume part of that came from agitation at the time in 167
and Senator Fulbright's own determination that that program not
be used.for operational purposes.

It was the original intent of this language to extend
that prohibition, which is now a matter of ‘public record, this.--
actually, that part ‘of the instruction is in the public record
now under the Freedom of Information Act, that part of 50-10
that talks about Fulbright grantees. It was the original

intent of the recommendation that is now before you to extend

that prohibition on Fulbright grantees to all of those under

the Fulbright-Hayes legislation. Under the specifics of the
Agency's interpretation, it makes a distinction between those
students, or graduate students, or professors selected by the
Board of Foreign Scholarships, and the rest -- and the rest
includes cultural leader grants and the like.

“Now, perhaps it might be the sensible thing in the
language like this to confine it to the Fulbright-Hayes Act,
which is the basic legislation which deals with this.

Senator Schweiker. “How many others would you have outside
of that? Would you have a lot of other programs?

Mr. Bader, I really wouldn't know, Senator. I think it
is the major part of it, actually. You could have a National
Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in which a person would
go overseas, and this, under the language we now have before
you, that would include those individuals.

The Chairman. Well, I can see how vulnerable a grantee
might be when approached, and if we have already written
into law a prohibition that relates to the Fulbright scholars,
I.should think it sient to apply to any others that are
receiving educational or cultural grants from the United

directive of the Agency, and as the Senators know, those
directives are certainly subject to change, so there really
are, in effect, two basic parts of this recommendation. One
was to commit the present internal prohibitions of the CIA to
law, and then to extend it, and the issue before the Committee,

in addition to whether there should be an extension, is sort

of how far and what language should be used to portray or

| convey that prohibition?

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, do we have anything from
the Agency on this?

Senator Huddleston. it think you've got to weigh, to some
extent, the value of the two programs, of our cultural exchange
programs' importance. I think the mblic knowledge of any one
individual becomes known as a-spy who is associated with a :
program, it has a devastating effect, in my judgment, on the
program and on all students who are participating in it. I
just think the risk is too great.

any impact. at ‘all in a totalitarian state, none.

It is really a one way Street.

Now, I am all for cultural exchange, simply because I
like to watch Russian ballet dancers, especially females, but
the fact of the matter is cultural change does more to soften
up the American public toward the Iron Curtain than the
other way around.

cultural exchange, and how you view ballerinas, but. the question

Senator Tower. Well, I think in many instances American
operations abroad that have been completely innocent have been
labeled as spy operations for propaganda purposes by the other
side, and they will do that if they choose to. They will-not
do it if they choose not to do it.

The Chairman. But you have many of these students. who are
not inside Russia or in a Communist country. We have ea

Operational use does. not, by the Agency's definition,
involve individuals who would come to the Central Intelligence
Agency to voluntarily give whatever information that they
think would be of value to the Agency, the kind of information
that the Contacts Division normally would like to have.

Senator Tower, Yes, but once having done that, the Agency
determines this person is valuable and they observe this
person and they put him under a control officer.

would be operational use!

Senator Huddleston. ‘It would not include a debriefing of

more and report back on, the very same subject that he just
reported on, which might be a critical target to the United

47.

The Committee previously agreed to extend the CIA
prohibitions on the use of media to the use of ee person
who regularly contributes material to publications and those
involved directly or indirectly in the editing or setting
policy and direction in the direction.of the activities of
U.S. media organizations.

What was unclear was. whether this was the recommendation

that, or whether this was to be embodied in statute as had
been recommended in Recommendation 46.
The Chairman. I'm sorry, I have lost you.

Mr. Aaron. You will find the words "proposed statutory

CIA prohibition" and you see the words “proposed" and
"statutory" are in brackets, reflecting uncertainty on our part
as to whether it was the intention of the Committee that this
prohibition simply be a CIA regulation or embodied in the
statute, which is recommended in the recommendation of procedures.

The Chairman. Senator Huddleston, do you have any comment
on this?

Senator Huddleston. :I have a personal feeling that when
we go too far statutorily in dealing with the press, that we
sometimes get on thin ice. I don't know whether it- would be
appropriate to make some suggestion here that the press itself
initiate certain standards and methods. Many of them in the
press believe they ought to have anyhow.

I think the recommendation for the CIA is probably

sufficient. i

The Chairman. and let that be handled as a matter of
CIA regulations.

Senator Huddleston. Rather than by statute.

The Chairman. Rather than by statute.

Is that Seem e nets the Committee?

recommend that the CIA, | by regulation, handle this matter

rather than make it statutory.

concept determine whether they want to do it by either statute
or regulation. I am opposed to doing it by either.

Senator Schweiker. I would like to see it by statute if
we are going to do it.

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, does this make any distincti
between domestic media and -- on the media located physically
within the United States and the U.S. media outside the
United States? i

{
The Chairman. No,'it does not. It simply attempts to

prevent the CIA from involving itself with personnel who are
part of the U.S. media, whether here e abroad, as I read it.

Senator Tower. ee ae let me ask you a question.

What is there is a Reuters reporter in Moscow who is
cooperating with us, and Reuters contributes regularly to U.S.
media?

Senator Schweiker. We spent an Toae on that. They are
excluded. We argued that for an hour and I lost the point, so
they would be excluded.

Senator Huddleston. This basically just extends to
CIA's own prohibition that they had initiated against what we-
would normally think of as working journalists, and includes

into it the executives and editors and those who may be

freelancing.

Time he would be.

Mr. Aaron. Under the Agency's current regulations and
own prohibitions, a foreign journalist working for Timé Magazine
oversees would be prohibited from being used by them for
operational purposes. That is their own position today. This
would extend that prohibition to someone who is, what in the
trade jargon is a stringer, or --

Senator Tower. This would inciude a stringer?

Senator Schweiker. It wouldn't cover Reuters or some
other foreign news service. :

Mr. Aaron. It would also apply to a foraigner who was,
for example, if there were such a thing as an editor in the

way, but say there were such a person, it would apply to him
as well.

extend the exclusion to stringers, those who do not have

The Chairman. And editors and executives.

Mr. Bader. The present restriction, Senator Tower,

accreditation to include those who regularly contribute to

contribute material to or are involved directly or indirectly

we had better decide on the policy. If we want to keep the

the Committee that the CIA do it, because the CIA regulations
may or may not issue, and they can be changed at any time
without notice.

Senator Tower. Well, Mr. Chairman, aren't we talking about)
two different things? :

I don't mean-foreign, you know, our foreign correspondents
abroad writing CIA propaganda for American publications. We
are talking about operations here, operational use, not use
to write some article that the CIA wants planted in an American
publication. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking
about using him to gather intelligence, and it goes back
directly to the CIA which doesn't serve as a publication.

The Chairman. But operational use can include many things
including writing propaganda and usually would if it involved
journalists.

Senator Tower. Well, I think we have already got a
prohibition on that. :

Mr. Bader. The prohibition that the Central Intelligence
Agency has self-imposed extends across the line from cover
to. placement to all operational use of individuals, accredited
individuals to American media organizations. As I say, the
difference between what the Agency has already taken upon
itself and what this recommendation involves is this recommen-
dation extends it to individuals who are not accredited.

which have been authentic¢ated by the Agency, that there are
some 60 Americans who are affiliated or are part of American
media organizations around the world, part of a larger network
of some 400 journalists and the like who are part of the Agency'
overall media asset program, and of .those 60 under the Agency's
present prohibitions, the ones recently imposed, it would go

to just one third of those individuals.

This prohibition would extend it from the one third to

all because the other two: thirds include people. that are
under cover, who are in management, and who are not under
the technical term accredited to U.S. media organizations.

Mr. Chairman, I might say if the Committee would look
at the Recommendation 46 that goes before 47, perhaps it might
bear in mind that the récommendation in 46, which takes the
present Agency prohibitions and says that they should be
established in law, if in 47, if the Committee should so
decide to do it by recomilendation, that they change their
internal prohibitions, there will be a contrast between 46
and 47.

The Chairman. Well, let's have a vote. Let's go back
to 46, and I take it that the recommendation is that this
prohibition that the CIA has imposed upon itself ought to
be written in statutory form.

Mr. Bader. That is |the recommendation.
