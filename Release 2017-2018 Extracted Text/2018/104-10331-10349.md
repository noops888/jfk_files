details the facts relating to records already processed under the Freedom of Information and
Privacy Acts (FOIPA) and the commitment of the FBI to provide the records to the public.

¥BI CORE FILES AND ASSASSINATION RELATED FILES

Enclosure C contains the list of subjects and a summary of the files collected and
identified in 1992 as the John F. Kennedy (JFK) Assassination Core Files and Related Files as
prepared for Director Sessions’ statement. The summary was presented to Congress asan
explanation of the pages processed under the FOIPA and available to the public in the FBIHQ's
FOIPA Reading Room. Research about how the universe of files known as “Core-and Related,”
were grouped and titled did not produce a precise definition, A review of tickler notes related to
the FOIPA requests suggests that the group of files identified as “Core” was collected to respond
to FOIPA requests received in 1976 for files on the assassination. The group of files known as
“Related” seemed to have been established due to additional FOIPA requests and appeals. for'files
associated with the assassination. The John F. Kennedy Task Force (JFKTF) could not find any
documentation when the term of “Core and Related” was initiated,

FBI RECORDS SYSTEM

The FBI currently maintains seventeen record systems. The Privacy Act requires
that every type of record system used by a government agency be disclosed to the public. The
following is the list of records explained in the Federal Register (Enclosure D).

001. The National Crime Information Center (NCIC).
002. Central Records System (CRS).
003. The Bureau Mailing Lists.
004, Routine Correspondence Handled by Preprinted Form.
005. Routine Correspondence Prepared Without File
Yellow.
006. Electronic Surveillance Indices (ELSUR).
007. The FBI Automated Payroll System.
008. The Bureau Personnel Management System (BPMS).
009. The Fingerprint Identification Records System (FIRS).
010. Employee Travel Vouchers and Individual Earning Records,
011. Employee Health Records.
012. Time Utilization Record-Keeping System (TURK).
013, Security Access Control System (SACS).

Mr. David G. Marwell

Ten of the above record systems do not concern the investigative area. The five
record systems of an investigative nature, but not relevant to the assassination, are 001(NCIC),
009 (FIRS), 015 (NCAVC), 016 (CIS), and 017 (NDIS). Information from these records-’
systems is retrievable through index searches of each respective system. The JFKTF did not
search the indices of these systems, since they were not applicable at the time of the assassination
or the related investigations. In addition, record systems 003 through 005, 007, 008, and 010
through 014 were not relevant to the Act since they are internal FBI systems such as the payroll,
the handling of Bureau mail, health records, and other noninvestigative administrative matters.
involving Bureau employees. The two systems of records relevant to the Act and searched by the
FBI were 002 Central Records’ System (CRS) and 006 Electronic Surveillance Indices (ELSUR).

The following information will explain the FBI's system of. recording, filing, and
retrieving ents at the FBL The FBI's primary records repository is its CRS, which was
automated b: ing in 1978. The old manual card index of the CRS was maintained, since the
automation did not encompass all of the old records,. The FBI maintains the CRS for its
investigative, personnel, applicant, administrative, and general files. Although the FBI has other
record systems as explained above, the CRS is the primary and most important system for
retrieving assassination related records. It consists of a numerical sequence index of subject
matter files and an alphabetical index to these files called the general index.

The FBI's filing system follows a numbering method used to show (1) the
classification or type of investigative violation or administrative area involved, (2) the individual
case file within the category, and (3) the serialization of individual documents commonly called,
pieces of mail, in the file. Once a violation defines the classification, then the case portion of the
file number is assigned by subject. For instance, the number 91-200-20 on a piece of mail says it
is the 20th piece of mail in the 200th case file assigned to the bank robbery 91 classification.
This example would not be correct for the newest segment of files in the automated indices, the
Universal Case File (UCF) which wes established in November 1991. However, the FBI's ISK
collection of filss ead docuraents knowa at this point ¢o not fall within the UCF system.

Each classification maintains a zero (0) and a double zero (00) file. The 0 and 00
files are “general files" and precede the first case file in each classification. The 0 file is used for
complaints and miscellaneous nonspecific data relating to the classification that does not warrant
establishing a separate case file. The 00 file is used for collecting, in one place, policies and
procedures that refer to the particular classification or violation category. The FBI files each
document conceming policy and procedure serially in the 00 file of the appropriate classification.
Therefore, every time a change in policy, procedure, instruction, or guideline occurs; it is
documented in this category, with the information Ueiag placed in the 00 fis.

The FBI's indexing of the CRS general indices falls into two separate categories,
“Main” and “Cross” references, A Main index reference carries the name of an individual,
organization, activity, or the like which is the primary subject of the file maintained in the


13-09000
++ JUN-26-1997 @8:21 JFK TASK FORCE 282 324 says Pues

Mr. David G. Marwell

system. All the documents created for a subject involving a particular violation will be filed in
that particular subject’s main file. A Cross index reference contains only a mention or reference
toa particular individual, organization, activity, or the like found in the body of a document ina
file on another main subject. The case agent or records specialist indexes the cross reference, so
the information can be found later when it may be significant.

The FBI also maintains the ELSUR Index that contains the names of persons _
whose voices have been monitored through an FBI microphone installation or a telephone
surveillance, This index consists of three categories of information: Principals (Targets) of an
electronic surveillance; Proprietary Interests; and Overhears. The FBI initiated the ELSUR index
at the recommendation of the Department of Justice. The index covers the electronic surveillance
sought by or conducted by the FBI since January 1, 1960. This index was automated in October
1991. Unlike the CRS, the FBI automated the entire indices, so only one search is necessary,

For the FBI to ensure that all the documents mandated by the Act were found, the
IFKTF requested those specifically trained in the record systems to conduct searches of both the
automated and manual CRS indices and the automated ELSUR index. The search included all
the core and related subjects as defined in Enclosure C. The searches were conducted at FBIHQ
and in the Field and Legat Offices. The FBI record specialists assigned to this task employed the
normal procedures for searching all the relevant indices to respond to the Act. . Their appropriate
supervisors approved the work.

The House Select Committee on Assassination (HSCA) was a Congressional
Committee established to review possible theories of the assassinations concerning President
John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Martin Luther King. The JFKTF identified the universe of
files known as the “HSCA Files” by reviewing the HSCA request letters, the FBI response letters,
administrative folders and copies of the files shown to the HSCA staff. The copies of the HSCA
files and folders were segregated at the end of the Committee's investigation due to an agreement
with the Committee. The JFKTF identified the HSCA Field Office ELSUR documents
concerning the requested subjects by using the same records previously mentioned.

Conceming the Board's requests involving "JUNE MAIL,” "Do Not File"
memoranda, “informant files,” “personnel files" and "COINTELPRO activities,” the information
in those categories, if maintained as records, are indexed and filed in the CRS. Therefore, the
universe of assassination records searched for and collected would include any documents with
the above notations. At FBIHQ, sensitive records requiring restricted access are maintained in
the Special File Room (SFR) which is a repository for sensitive records, In the Field Offices the
sensitive documents are also maintained in special areas, such as the SAC’s Safe. All
assassination related records that the FBI maintains in the secure areas are also retrievable
through the systems searched. The FBI used these systems to search all areas for indexed and
retrievable records.

FBI RECORDS STORAGE FACILITIES :

For storage of records outside FBI space, the FBI Headquarters uses two off-site
facilities. One location is Pickett Street in Alexandria, Virginia. This facility contains most of
the FBI's closed files that were previously housed at FBIHQ at 10th and Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, D.C. Thé other off-site facility is in Boyers, Pennsylvania, This location houses:
FBI Legat information. The Legat information at Boyers, is also on "Microfilm" at FBIHQ. The -
only additional records maintained at the Boyer's location consist of National Lawyers Guild files
that are "Court Sealed" records. The Boyers, Pennsylvania records’ storage area is rented by the
FBI from the National Underground Storage Company.

—

addition, the field offices have three official off cite storage facilities. These :
facilities are lo! at Butte, Montana; Pocatello, Idaho; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. All three
locations have archival disposition offices to decide the handling of closed files, but all decisions
are forwarded to FBIHQ’s archival office for final approval. All FBI Field Offices and FBI
Legats send information requiring “record-keeping” to FBIHQ.

FBI RELEASES TO
NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION (NARA)

Enclosure E depicts all releases made to NARA from the first release on
‘December 13, 1993, to the 16* release on December 20, 1996. A special note is made that the
total number of pages since 1992 has expanded from 236,000 pages to more than 666,000 pages
made available to the public, This includes the re-processing of all core and related files
according to the Act, The FBI has developed a plan with the Board’s staff to streamline this
process, The change will cause an initial delay for the next release, but eventually the releases
will occur more often and with fewer postponements.

FBI RESPONSES TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS

Throughout the process of responding to the Board's specific numbered requests
the JFKTF staff is in frequent contact with employees of the Board. The Board has also
requested information from our records concerning other areas that may have some relation to the
assassination. The memoranda from the Board to the FBI indicate that the FBI has addressed
both written and oral requests from the Board. Where there are no specific written responses
from the FBI to the Board, the FBI either handled these responses orally with members of the
staff or is in the process of responding. The JFKTF prepared an inventory of the requests and
Status of responses and shared this information with the Board. However, the responses to the
numbered letter requests will be documented later.

FBI INFORMANT/CONFIDENTIALITY POSTPONEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

This document will address the postponement practices
of the FBI relating to informants and others with whom tHe FBI
has a confidential relationship (informant/confidentiality
postponements) in documents being transferred to the National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA) under the "President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992"
(the Act). To provide a basis for the formulation of these ~
practices, their description will be preceded by a discussion of
the classes of persons protected by an understanding of |
confidentiality, as well as the development, operation,
protection, and investigative significance of such persons.
Other determinations underlying these practices will -also be
addressed. The information contained in thig document’ is ,based
not only on the experience of the FBI and law*enforcement. and
intelligdnce communities in general, but on the personal
investigative experiences of some of the contributors to it.

CLASSES OF CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS

The FBI maintains a confidential relationship with
several types of persons. They include:

1. Criminal Informants who provide information
regarding criminal activity, including organized crime, white
collar crime, violent crime, drug trafficking, and, today,
domestic terrorism. All such individuals are now assigned
identifying symbol numbers (to be described hereafter) to protect
their. identities in documents containing information they have
provided. However, before and at the time of the Assassination,
and for some years thereafter, the names of the persons under
development as informants (Potential Criminal Informants or PCIs)
were reflected in documents until their reliability could be
established and they were converted to Criminal Informant (CI) s
status. Upon conversion to CI status the informant was assigned
an identifying symbol number for protection.

There are a number of subgroups within the criminal
informant program. While some CIs are considered general
criminal informants, others are categorized according to the
specialized area in which they provide information. These would
include, for example, Organized Crime (OC) informants, who
provide information primarily regarding subjects involved in
organized crime. activity, and Top Echelon informants (TE), who
provide information regarding the highest levels of organized
crime.

From the time a person comes under development as an
informant (in previous years as a PCI), he or she is made the
subject of an individual file. This file contains information

MP ituane



13-00000

x
er
provided by the person, as well as administrative and background
data regarding the source.

2. National Security Informants who today provide
foreign counterintelligence and international terrorism ;-
information, and, in years past, also included those informants
who provided information regarding domestic security/terrorism.
Such informants are now referred to as assets, but at the time of
the Assassination and for some years thereafter were labelled
Security Informants (SIs). Like criminal informants, ‘assets:.are
provided identifying symbol numbers for protection, as were SIs.
before them. Persons under development as SIs were considered
Potential Security Informants (PSIs) and, as with PCIs, their
true identities were reflected in documents until they were
converted to symbol-number status.

The FBI operates various types of National Security
assets. They include: ee ian

Double Agents. A double agent is one who receives
assignments from, cooperates with, and/or performs tasks for a
foreign intelligence service on a clandestine basis but who, in
actuality, operates in this capacity under the control of the
U.S. Government.

Defector Sources. A defector source is an individual
who possesses intelligence information of value and has either
openly or without announcement left the employment of his or her
country and is furnishing information to the U.S. Government.

Recruitments in Place (RIP). A RIP is an_individual
from a foreign country who covertly provides information of
intelligence value to the U.S. Government while outwardly
maintaining allegiance to his or her own government.

While under development as PSIs, SIs (like PCIs) were
made the subject of individual files which contain information
provided as well as administrative data and background
information. Today, an individual becomes the subject of a file
at the outset of his or her development as an asset.

3. It should be noted that in recent years the FBI has
designated Cooperating Witnesses (CWs) as constituting another
class of source. A CW is defined as an individual whose
relationship with the Government is concealed until testimony is
required at trial and who, on a continuing basis and under the
direction of an Agent, contributes substantial operational
assistance to the resolution and/or direction of a case through
active participation in the investigation. CWs are unlike
informants, who gather intelligence and will not testify.
Although CWs are aware from the outset that it is likely that
they may be required to publicly admit their cooperation with law

2


13-00000

we
enforcement, the FBI has taken the position that, in the absence
of public testimony, the relationship with a CW is similar to the
relationship with any other source. That is to say, if for any
reason the CW is never publicly exposed in trial, the
relationship remains confidential. In addition, the ,
intelligence, as opposed to operational assistance, furnished by
a CW also is protected, along with the confidential relationship
as it relates to such information.

&

4. Sources given expressed promises of confidentiality
in connection with the information they provided in the course of
criminal, counterintelligence, and background investigations.
Oftentimes, when associates or neighbors, as well as persons in
businesses, public utilities, government agencies, and elsewhere
are contacted in the course of an investigation, they agree to
provide information only if they are assured that their ..
identities will be protected under a promise-~of confidentiality.
Where such a promise is given, documents contdining such ~
information will contain the name of the person providing the
information as well as language specifically setting forth the
fact that confidentiality was requested. No file is opened on
such persons and no symbol numbers are assigned to protect their
identities. Furthermore, unlike informants, little background
information other than an address or perhaps. the name of. an
employer is set forth for these sources in FBI files.

5. Persons providing information requiring that
confidentiality be afforded its source: In certain instances in
the past (to include the time of the Assassination), the FBI
received information from persons in financial institutions,
public utilities, and other similar entities that would not have
been publicly available. In fact, today, a subpoena would be
required to obtain bank records, telephone toll records, and
other like materials provided by such persons. These persons
generally provided such information on a regular basis.
Regardless of the frequency with which they provided information,
they would have done so only with the understanding that they
were doing so on a confidential basis, even where that
understanding is not specifically articulated in FBI documents.
Additionally, much of the information necessary for the FBI to
successfully carry out its investigative function comes from
private citizens that are either approached by the FBI for
questioning or who voluntarily come forward. Before the passage
of provisions of the Freedom of Information/Privacy Act in the
mid-1970s allowing access to FBI investigative files, it can be
stated with virtual certainty that no person providing such
information would have anticipated his or her cooperation ever
being made public. In fact, prior to the passage of the Privacy
Act of 1974, all FBI investigative information, including that
obtained from informants and sources, was confidential by
Department of Justice Order. After passage of the Privacy Act,
an expressed grant of confidentiality was required in order to

3


13-00000

me

€
to balance the risk of harm to the person or to the informant
program in these judgement calls. (see Tab 6)

5. The most difficult category of sources to deal with
is that of persons providing information to the FBI without a
specific request for confidentiality. In the attempt to release
as much material as possible, the identities of most of these
sources were released, but, once again, the FBI has attempted to
balance the need to maximize released information with the
potential harm to the individual source. (see Tab 7

6. The "Mosaic Theory" is of particular importance with
regard to the transfer of FBI files to NARA under the terms of
the Act. The FBI has maximized the release of information
maintained in the Assassination files in order to comply with
both the letter and the spirit of the Act, and this has resulted
in an unprecedented amount of informant information béing jade
available to the public. However, the FBI has’ postponed
informant| symbol numbers wherever that informant is providing
positive information, under the terms of the Act which allow for
the postponement of the identity of informants. The release of
these symbol numbers, in combination with the information already
released, could very well lead to the identification of a number
of FBI informants.

The FBI is currently reviewing for transfer the
material which was provided to the HSCA in 1978. With respect to
the HSCA files, the Task Force has been more protective of all
types of sources, but particularly organized crime and national
security informants, due to the real danger of retaliation
against them, even after these many years. The informants and.....
other sources utilized in these investigations were specifically
targeted against subjects of investigative interest, and it is
not readily apparent how they might figure in a conspiracy to
assassinate JFK. Anticipating the opportunity to discuss these
concerns with the ARRB, the balancing test for the HSCA files, at
the present, has been necessarily weighted in favor of
postponement of any information which might tend to identify a
source. Of course, if any information is located in these files
which bears, even indirectly, on the assassination, that
information will be considered under the most liberal light
possible.

BASIS FOR INFORMANT/CONFIDENTIALITY POSTPONEMENT PRACTICES

Again, the FBI has attempted to postpone the release of
information only where there are compelling reasons to do so.
There are no more compelling reasons for postponement than those
underlying the protection being given informants and others with
whom the FBI has confidential relationships. The rationale for
postponement in this area is clear from the discussion of

10


13-00000

i
informants, assets, and other confidential sources set forth
above.

The privilege available to the government to withhold
the identity of persons who furnish information to officers
charged with law enforcement is well established in the law. The
rationale for the informant privilege has been explained as
follows:

{I]t has been the experience of law enforcement

officers that the prospective informer will usually.

condition his cooperation on an assurance of anonymity,
fearing that if disclosure is made, physical harm or
other undesirable consequences may be visited upon him
or his family. By withholding the identity of the
informer, the government profits in that the continued
value of informants placed in strategic positions is

protected, and other persons are encouraged” to ,

Peseta sei in the administration of justice.
United States v. Tucker, 380 F.2d 206, 213 (2d Cir. 1967); accord
In_ re United States, 565 F.2d 19 (2d Cir. 1977), ce deni
nom, Bell v. Socialist Workers Party, 436 U.S. 962 (1978)

To reduce the length of the body of this document,
further discussion of the privilege is not set forth here but is
contained in the appendices. (see Tab 8)

The FBI and the Department of Justice have gone to
great lengths in the past to protect the identity of informants.
Prosecutions have been dropped rather than divulge an informant
identity, a former Attorney General (Griffin Bell) risked being
held in contempt of court rather than idéntify informants in a
civil suit, and the FBI has often had to weather the
protestations of other agencies which were given information
derived from sources but which, despite their considerable
insistence, were not informed of the identity of these sources.

The FBI believes that its informant /confidentiality
practices are consistent with the postponement provisions of the
Act. The practice is clearly consistent with the language of
Section 6 (subsection 4) of the Act that permits the postponement
of relationships currently requiring protection when public
disclosure would be so harmful that it outweighs the public
interest. That is because unless a confidential relationship has
already been disclosed, and regardless of whether the source is
active or even still living, the relationship must remain
confidential for the protection of the source and/or his or her
family, as well as to sustain the viability of the FBI's source
development efforts.

Again considering the balancing test under which an
agency must show that the need to protect certain information

11


13-00000

_
s

Of

through postponement outweighs the public interest in the
information proposed for postponement, ‘the FBI believes there can
be little or no historical interest in the identity of someone
who did not provide positive information, a situation that occurs
frequently in the "core" files. At the same time, the damage to
individuals and the FBI's source development efforts resulting
from disclosure would be great.

Where there is positive information attributed to a
source whose identity is being postponed, the result of applying
the balancing test is virtually the same'as that where the
contact was negative. The information provided by the source,
which is being disclosed, is of significantly greater public
interest than the source's identity, which is being postponed.
Disclosure of the source's identity accomplishes little in terms
of satisfying the public interest when compared, agai! to the
potential harm to the source and/or his or her family, as well as
the FBI's source development capabilities. Ir’ a number of
instanced, the source of positive information is referred to not
by name, but by symbol number. There would appear to be little
if any public interest in such an identifier except, perhaps, on
the part of persons attempting to apply ‘the Mosaic approach
simply to determine the identities of informants or assets.

While the FBI does not directly rely on those grounds
for postponement centered on the unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy in regard to informant/confidentiality postponements,
such privacy concerns are also a part of the FBI's rationale for
its informant/confidentiality practices. Exposing a source
and/or his or her family to any of the various forms of
retaliation that might result from a disclosure of the source's
identity would constitute, at the very least, an unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy.

CONCLUSION

Criminal informants and National Security informants
(assets) are, respectively, absolutely indispensable resources in
the effort to maintain public safety and to protect the national
security. It would not be possible to have effective law
enforcement without informants, as well as ordinary citizens, who
are willing to provide information on a confidential basis, nor
would it be possible to maintain the security of this nation
without the cooperation of assets and other sources. In turn,
without the ability to honor the obligation to maintain the
confidentiality that is central to the relationship that must
exist with informants, assets, and other sources, there would be
a chilling effect that could irreparably debilitate efforts to
obtain the critical assistance needed from such persons if law
enforcement and national security missions are to be effectively
carried out. Furthermore, the obligation to protect the

12


i
S

confidential relationship with informants and other sources is
one that must attach in perpetuity, not just because of the need
to protect the source and the source's family as promised, but so
that those that might serve as sources in the future are not
deterred from doing so because of a justifiable fear of 4
disclosure and the ensuing risk of harm to themselves and ‘their
families.

Again, in its effort to maximize disclosure under the
Act, the FBI carefully examined every situation in which it
contemplated postponement of information and, more especially,
any type of information (e.g. the identities of or information
tending to identify informants or other confidential sources)
that appears widely throughout the JFK documents. In doing so,
the FBI made the inescapable determination that it must
absolutely protect the identities of informants and others with

Mr. David G. Marwell

The Board sent a letter dated January 22, 1997 documenting a meeting between
the FBI and the Board's staff. The letter verified additional important items of interest that the
FBI will address in the compliance statement. The FBI is responding to these issues and Will
document the findings with the numbered letter request response.

FBI DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS

Conceming the FBI's destruction of records, the JFKTF compiled a listing of
destroyed material from the Field Office responses to the initial request (Enclosure F). Any
material destroyed followed the destruction policy of the FBI, which is explained as follows:

The Destruction of FBI files and records are govemed by 44 U.S.C, Sections 3303
Saray 36 CFR Part 1220, the General Records Schedule (GRS); and the FBI

Retention Plan and Disposition A Schedule (The Plan) developed by
NARA and the FBI, which the United States District Court approved, District of
Columbia, Washington, D.C., September 9, 1986. ‘The actual reference material
pertinent to "The Plan,” is contained within two large loose-leaf notebooks, which
the Board’s staff reviewed.

When the JFKTF originated in 1992, a database was established to inventory all
the material for future accountability. As the FBI collected the assassination-related records, the
JEKTF entered data concerning all the documents responsive to the Act in this database and later
entered the data into the mandated NARA “Identification Aids” program. To date, the JFKTF
has not found any documents missing from the original inventories.

_ FBIFILES ON LOCATE

Enclosure G is a list of all remaining files that are “On Locate.” Certain files or
serials awaiting processing do remain "On Locate.” FBI employees assigned to the Information
Resources Division, File Services Unit (FSU), are tasked with finding files that are “charged-out"
to other employees within the FBI Please be assured that the employees of the JFKTF, with
employees from the FSU, are diligently working together to find files that are "On Locate.”

FBI RECORDS TO BE PROCESSED

Enclosure H is an updated list of all remaining subjects that are in various stages
of processing according to the Act. The enclosure explains the anata stage of processing for
each remaining subject.

Conceming the Board’s request that the Compliance Official (or Officials) be
made available for interviews, as the Compliance Official, I am the FBI's contact person for

protect the identity of sources used in background investigations
and civil cases. However, implied source confidentiality is
still in effect in criminal cases.

INFORMANT SYMBOL NUMBERS, ASSET CODE NAMES, AND THE. MOSAIC THEORY

Symbol numbers and code names are used as substitutes
for the true identities of informants and assets and serve-to
mask their identities in FBI documents. The use of these .x.
substitutes limits the knowledge of the sources' true identities
to those who have a "need to know". Likewise, utilization of
symbol numbers and code names prevents a breach of security from
being more serious than it otherwise might be should an FBI
document fall into unauthorized hands.

It should be pointed out here that, even within sthe
FBI, an informant's/asset's identity, and infdrmation tending to
reveal the same, is restricted, with their files maintained in a
separate and secure room, and with access to those files closely
monitored and limited only to those with a legitimate "need to
know".

In a discussion of the importance of maintaining the
confidential relationship with informants, it should be pointed
out that the identity of an informant can be determined by
factors other than the release of the informant's name. Multiple
releases of seemingly innocuous positive information attributable
to the same symbol source can, in the aggregate, lead to the
identification of an informant. This is known in the FBI as the
“Mosaic Theory" and it holds that the release of "singular
identifiers", such as symbol numbers, dates of contact,.places-of
contact, and even small amounts of information, can be pieced
together to pinpoint the source of information.

‘HE EI ID_OP| TION OF Et ‘S_AND_ OTHE! CES

The indispensability of criminal informants stems from
the fact that they save law enforcement inestimable amounts of
time and resources and, more importantly, enable law enforcement
to do what otherwise could not be done. They are often the only
means through which law enforcement agencies can identify, and
thereafter bring prosecutable cases against, the perpetrators of
virtually every type of crime. Moreover, where the criminal
activity is not readily apparent, as is generally the case with
organized crime and much white collar crime and large-scale
narcotics trafficking, informants enable law enforcement to
detect and address activity of which it would otherwise be
unaware. :

Informants are sometimes honest, law-abiding citizens,
but often are intimately acquainted with, or a part of, the

4


13-00000

0
wa?

criminal element. Those involved with the criminal element may
have been involved in activities ranging from petty theft to the
most serious of violations, but it is their familiarity with
other criminals that positions them to be of such great value to
law enforcement. Informants, especially those with records of
serious criminal activity, must be very closely managed so that
everything possible is done to prevent them from engaging .in
unauthorized criminal activities themselves while serving’as
informants.

Informants can be motivated to provide information by.a
number of factors, which might include one or more of the
following: civic duty or patriotism, revenge, fear of id
prosecution, rapport with law enforcement. officers, and/or money.
In every instance, however, the informant must have.confidence in
the ability of the law enforcement officer and that officer's
agency to protect his or her identity at all -costs, and im this
regard to, be most judicious in the manner in which the
information provided is used and disseminated.

Some informants, those principally motivated by money
or revenge, for example, might be easily developed. More often,
however, an informant is developed over a lengthy period of time.
The process begins by targeting someone for development based on
the person's potential knowledge of, and/or interaction with,
particular criminals and criminal activity, as well as their
perceived susceptibility to development. Having identified such
a person, a law enforcement officer might spend months, and
particularly in the organized trime arena, sometimes years,
patiently pursuing various efforts to find the key to winning the
confidence of the target. Once this confidence has been gained,
a flow of information can begin. Frequently limited at first,
this flow increases as trust in the relationship grows.

As mentioned previously, informants must be carefully
managed and operated, not only to deter their involvement in
criminal activity, but to obtain the maximum benefit of their
information gathering capability. Additionally, careful
management is required to guard against disclosure of their role,
either through injudicious actions on their part or through
mistakes in the use or dissemination of the information provided.
Great care must be taken, for example, to use an informant's
information in search warrants and other affidavits, and to share
it where necessary with other agencies, in ways. that do not lead
to the identification of the source.

Some informants may be in a position to provide
information on only one or two matters and are therefore operated
for short periods of time. Most informants, though, have
long-term relationships lasting not just years but sometimes
decades, all the while providing information that in most cases
law enforcement could not otherwise obtain. Even in

5


13-00000

circumstances where an informant is knowledgeable only about a
single case, and operation ceases after a short period of time,
that person might well be in a position to be reactivated as an
informant in future matters, sometimes in other parts of the
country, so long as the trust in his or her relationship,with law
enforcement remains intact.

Whatever the length of time the informant is operated,
he or she runs a risk of retaliation if their cooperation is
discovered by the criminal targets on which information has-been
provided. This risk is shared in many cases by the family of the
informant. The degree of risk varies according to the nature of
the criminal activity and the criminals involved and, generally,
the higher the stakes, the greater the risk. Clearly, in the
case of organized crime and other violent criminal activities,
the possibility of death or serious harm is substant 49) at not
certain. 3

\ Indeed, there have been instances of retaliation
against informants, as well as those suspected of cooperating
with law enforcement (see Tabs 1&2). The fact that there have
not been more such incidents attests to the ability of the FBI to
maintain the confidentiality of informants during and after the
time that they are actually operated.

Protecting the identities of informants and their
information is also essential from the standpoint of preventing
criminals from. learning how much law enforcement knows, or might
know, about the extent of their activities. Organized crime
families are particularly interested in, and go to great lengths
to determine, the extent to which they are penetrated, to. include
knowing the breadth of law enforcement coverage and the length of
time it has existed.

National Security assets provide information in support.
of FBI foreign counterintelligence. and counterterrorism
investigations. Assets in counterintelligence. investigations
often provide information regarding intelligence officers (IOs)
of hostile foréign intelligence services operating in the U.S.

An asset is most often a U.S. person who has some contact with
the I0, a fellow employee of an IO, a social friend, or even
another IO whom the FBI has recruited to work on behalf of the
U.S. Government .

Assets in counterterrorism investigations are often
associated with the same international terrorism organization as
the subject of the FBI investigation. These assets may also be
neighbors, co-workers or others in contact with the subject, or
persons to whom the subject has chosen to disclose his
activities.


13-00000

«i

In counterintelligence and counterterrorism
investigations, carefully developed and utilized assets are often
the critical means of obtaining on a recurrent basis accurate
information regarding the subjects of FBI investigations. These
assets may provide information on classified national security
information being sought or obtained by 10s of a hostile
intelligence service, or information regarding planned acts of
violence, fund-raising, or other activities of investigative
interest conducted by international terrorists.

The recruitment and operation of National Security
assets is analogous in many ways to that of. criminal informants.
Persons are targeted for development and are thereafter the
subjects of recruiting efforts that rely on motivation akin to
that used in the criminal field. In the National Security arena,
however, recruitment and operation may be most similap-in nature
to that of high-level organized crime informants, as the’ time
required for recruitment can be very lengthy, ‘the aversion to
recruitmdnt great, and the consequences of disclosure fatal.
Persons recruited as assets may represent their own countries,
and have strong allegiances to both their country and its
ideology. These are difficult factors to overcome, as is the
natural reluctance of these persons to undertake the grave risks
that disclosure would pose for them and their families, who often
remain in their home. countries. The practices, and in some cases
the laws of the countries in which the FBI has a
counterintelligence and/or counterterrorism interest, can involve
the harshest of penalties for persons engaged in espionage
against them. For evidence of the results of disclosure of an
asset's relationship with the FBI, one need look no further than
the recent investigation of former. CIA employee Aldrich Ames, in
which a number of foreign nationals who had cooperated with U.S.
intelligence services are believed to have been executed by
Russian authorities after Ames disclosed their identities to the
Russians.

Assets must be operated with the greatest of care
because hostile governments are particularly vigilant where
penetration of their ranks is concerned. The smallest pieces of
information can enable other intelligence agencies or terrorist
organizations to determine where they have been penetrated and
the extent to which their operations have been compromised.
Similarly, these agencies can profit immensely in their efforts
to counter penetration by knowing the level at which that
penetration has occurred and/or the number of assets being
operated against them.

Assets can be operated continuously or intermittently
for many years. “Moreover, the value of their information can
also extend for years when it serves as the basis for, or is
critical to, a longstanding counterespionage or counterterrorism
operation.


13-00000

wt

While they are not recruited or operated like
informants and assets, persons who request confidentiality when
voluntarily reporting information to the FBI, or when responding
to requests for information during the course of investigations,
are also critical to the FBI's law enforcement and national
security missions. This is also true of persons who, often as
the result of painstakingly cultivated relationships, regularly
provide information that is not generally or readily available to
the public.

Law enforcement and national security efforts would
both suffer immeasurably without the information that would be
unavailable unless these sources are secure in the knowledge that
they and their families are safe from any sort of retaliation
that might be directed against them. Absolute care. has always
been taken to protect the identities of these invalua’ ., SOurces,
and to ensure that the information they provide is no d
disseminated in a way that would compromise their confidential
relationchip with the FBI.

FBI_INFORMANT POSTPONEMENT PRACTICES

The FBI has been interpreting the section of the Act
describing the bases for postponement of information from the JFK
files in a way that maximizes disclosure. However, at the same
time, the FBI is assuming that the Act does not contemplate
disclosures that could cripple the efforts to maintain public
safety or protect national’security. This is particularly true
with regard to information contained in files that could result
in the identification of those persons with whom the FBI has
maintained a confidential relationship. In light of this, and
until guidance from the ARRB regarding these matters could be
sought, the FBI has postponed the release of such information.

From time to time, references will be made to
"positive" and "negative" contacts with sources. In FBI
parlance, a "positive" contact is one in which the source
provides information that is even the slightest bit useful in
regard to an investigative matter. A "negative". contact is one
in which the source can provide no useful information to the FBI
or knows nothing about a matter in which he or she is
specifically asked.

In the "core" Assassination files, which include those
files relating to Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby, and the JFK
Assassination Investigation, the majority of informant and other
source contacts were negative. After the Assassination, all of
the FBI's almost sixty field divisions were instructed to contact
" all informants....[a]s well as other sources" to determine if
they could provide any information about the Assassination or
about’ such subjects as Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby. Ina

8


13-00000

peo)
substantial majority of instances, the sources knew nothing about
the matter and the contacts were therefore reported as negative.
There were some examples of positive contact, however, as where
persons acquainted with Jack Ruby described his personality and
commented on his possible association with Oswald or members of
organized crime.

It should be noted that there is a substantial amount
of positive source information in the files that were provided to
the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). This
results from the fact that the HSCA collection includes
investigative files relating to a number of. individuals
identified as organized crime figures or intelligence agents from
hostile countries. Informants and others whose names or symbol
numbers appear in these files were specifically targeted against
the subject and therefore furnished information that was nearly
always positive. 7 }

\iIn brief, the guidelines set out below were utilized by
the FBI with respect to informant identities in the "Core" files:

1. All information received from informants or other
sources was released so long as the infc. atior. was not so
singular as to clearly identify the source. This has resulted in
the release of a very great percentage of the information
received from such sources. Any information considered central
to the investigation of the assassination would have been
released even at the risk of exposure to the informant.

(see Tab 3)

2. Informant symbol numbers were released when no
positive information was attributed”to them and no
characterization (description) of the source was provided.
(see Tab 4)

3. The names of informants, as well as their
identifying symbol number and file number when those informants
are either providing positive information or are characterized,
have been postponed in accordance with Section 6, subsections 2
and 4 of the Act . The information provided was only postponed
when so singular that certain identification of the informant
would result from its release. (see Tab 5)

4. The identities of those persons expressly requesting
confidentiality were, in general, protected and the information
that they provided was released. In most cases, this information
might have been available from a number of sources and
singularity was not a problem. In some cases, the names of
persons giving information in the course of their jobs (i.e.
police officials giving arrest records to the FBI), even if
requesting confidentiality, were released. The FBI has attempted
