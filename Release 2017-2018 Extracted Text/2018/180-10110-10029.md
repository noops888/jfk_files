The House Resolution 222, under which this Subcommittee |

investigation and study of the circumstances surrounding the

including determining whether the existing laws of. the United |
States concerning the protection of the President and the

investigatory jurisdiction and capability of agencies and

STK

departments are adequate in their provisions and enforcement;

i

and whether there was full disclosure of evidence and informa

tion among agencies. and departments of the United States
i government; and whether any information or evidence not in
4 the:possession of an.agency or department would have been of

| assistance in investigating the assassination; and why such

information was not provided or collected hy that agency or

i N j
4 department; and to make recommendations to the House, if the

Sdlect Committee deems it appropriate, for the amendment of

existing legislation or the enactment of new legislation.

I would like, because of the special. expertise of this
@ * || witness, if counsel will withhold for just a moment, say a
i word or two about the process that we are engaged in.

é { First, we commend you for your long years of service

to a very, very important agency of this government. I*

personally was a part of that in a very, very small way in

the Navy a long time ago, and I commend you for your dedica-
tion and your experience and what has come to be your reputa-
tion. for, as we have talked with other members of the agency, |
they have referred toyyou as sort of the touchstone, or the
" person who was the expert among the experts.

I want to say also that I personally want to commend
our Chief Counsel, Professor Blakey, and our assistant
counsels for their long and dilligent effort to build a
relationship with the agencies which is now beginning to he
extremely productive and fruitful in our whole process of
trying to get all the information and to lay the matter of

the assassination of the President of the United States to

rest permanently with the complete story.

I just wanted you to know that we have been working

with the CIA and the FBI and they have been very cooperative

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicatéd that you were not
involved in the actual decision-making process. Were you
privy to the actual decision-making process?

Ms. Goodpasture. It depended upon what. it concerned.
If it was a project that I worked on, I participated in it,
but if it were a station activity, I did not.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did yow work at the station in Mexico
City also involve occasionally making contact. with CIA agents
in the field?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes,

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you give the Congressional panel
an evaluation of Winn Scott's competence as the Chief of
Station?

Ms.. Goodpasture. Well, I think that he was a very
conscientious man, he was a hardworking man, he expected
everyone else to do their work, he worked long hours. Some
people felt, or expressed the opinion, in my presence, that
he was a hard worker and expected too. much from employees,
but I. do not think that that was really the case. He was
a very conscientious man, an intelligent man. He obviously
had the intelligence for the post, or he would not have been
assigned there.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is the Mexico City station one of the
largest CIA stations in operation?

photographic surveillance,

There was also what they called foot.surveillance at |
times, when people were interested, they could find out where :
they were staying, where they went from the Soviet Embassy. |

Mr. Goldsmith, That would be physical surveillance?

Ms. Goodpasture, Right.

Mr, Goldsmith. Turning first to the area of photographi

surveillance, what was the purpose of the photographic
surveillance project with regard to the Soviet and Cuban
embassies and consuls?

Ms. Goodpasture. My: understanding of that was that it
was to be used to identify those people who might be working
for the Soviets as espionage agents who were U.S. citizens

At that time, it was one of the largest ones in Latin America
but not in comparison to the other places. I could not
comment on the size of the other placés.

Mr. Goldsmith. What kind of attitude did Mr. Scott

at the Mexico City station?

Ms, Goodpasture, He was very conscientious.. He wanted
them maintained accurately and completely.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long were the files that he main-
tained preserved?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, I am not too sure about that.

They were there up until the time that I left, but I think

| that there was a reduction because of space in 1969. ‘The

files were cut back, but I do not have firsthand knowledge

: of that because I did not participate in it.

Mr. Goldsmith. During the time that you were in Mexico
City with Mr. Scott, to your knowledge was anything ever
thrown out of destroyed from the Mexico City station files?

Ms. Goodpasture. Well, several things were destroyed

that were not considered of any value as far as the work at

| that. time was concerned. We looked at it more or less like
; keep cash register receipts for a grocery bill. There was a

| limitation of space on just how long you. could keep certain

things.

But there were no documents that were a part of the

Turning now to the photographic surveillance operation
with regard ta the Soviet Embassy and consulate, I would

like to ask you, what role, if any, did you play with regards |
to this surveillance operation during 1963?

4 Ms, Goodpasture. In 1963, I was more or less a bystander
of that operation because the operation, at times, was a

by another case officer,
1

4 I screened and looked at the photographs because I had

20024 (202) S54-2345

been there in the early part of the operation where the

photograph. bases were first set up, were first used. I had
an interest in them, or looked at them to see that they were
in focus, that the negatives were all printed, and Mr, .

Scott. asked me to do that because I had beer a commercial

photographer before I went to work for the government,
Mr. Goldsmith, Are you saying, in 1963, your roll !
with regard ta the photograpliic surveillance at the Soviet
Embassy was: to review photographs, essentially to evaluate
their quality?

Ms, Goodpasture, Their technical quality.

1 Mr, Goldsmith, Not for the purpose of obtaining subse-

i quent. information from the photographs?

1 Ms. Goodpasture. No, because, at that time, by 1963

| there was a.staff there who had been assigned to work on

Soviet matters. and it was. their function to inyestigate the

leads -- we called them leads -- to try to identify the person,

BW 50955 Docld:32263434 Page 15


i at the Soviet. embassy they were interested in,

So all the raw material went. to them. I usually took

a quick look at the photographs when they came in, and if
I noticed anything significant about them, I mentioned it to |

the Soviet case officer, but. he gave the formal reporting on ;

all the Soviet information.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand. |

o

How many cameras were in operation with regard to the

2024 (202) SSH-234S

photosurveillance of the Soviet Embassy and consulate? i

Ms. Goodpasture. Threé. There were three, generally.

There could be any number. if we wanted to put some on

the street but at. that time, I think there were only three.
Mr. Goldsmith. Where a these cameras located?
Ms. Goodpasture. Where? i
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, i
Ms, Goodpasture,. They were located around the building.

the embassy building, to cover the area in.the yard and in

the front gate.

i
1
|
i
|
Mr. Goldsmith, So the cameras were situated so that |
i
|
they would photograph the yard area and front entrance gate? |

Ms. Goodpasture, Yes. i

Mr, Goldsmith. During this period, was your role with
regards ta this project at any time of a supervisory nature, {

actually supervising the project?

Ms... Goodpasture, Informally it could have been interpreted

in that. way, but I never had the responsibility for them
alone,

Mr. Goldsmith. As a practical matter, you were acting

in an informal supervising capacity?

Ms, Goodpasture. It could have been interpreted that
way by some of the people, because they would come to me and

bring me photographs and say, what do you think of this, do

you think that this is a Latin, or do you think he has ever
been to the Soviet Embassy. before,

Mr. Goldsmith. In your own opinion do you think you
were acting, at least informally, in a supervisory capacity

with regards to this project?

Ms, Goodpasture, No.

Mr. Goldsmith. At this time, I would like for the |
witness: to be given Stack C of the documents that have been
prepared. : i

I would like to draw your attention to page 2 of the i

documents that appear in Stack C.

Mr, Goldsmith, I would like to ask you if you can

from the Mexico station.on the 8th of October,

that the message should he sent; generally the releasing offi-|

cer is the chief, the senior person there at the time, the

person who will assume responsibility for the message after

it has been transmitted.

Mr. Goldsmith. The message would go --

Ms. Goodpasture, For instance, in an Embassy, if a
document goes to the communications. center signed by someone
who is not thé senior person.in the section, they will not

send it; just everybody cannot take a message to the message

‘i center and say, send this cable to Washington.

Mr.¢Goldsmith. Yes, sir. .

Mr. Fithian. . In our Navy communications sytem, we
sometimes distinguished between. an authenticating officer as
one who not only authorized the sending of the cable, but
authenticated or verified or vouched for, the content.

Is that similar?

Ms, Goodpasture. That would be the literal interpre-

Mr. Goldsmith. Working in Mexico City for eleven

years and you do not know what the working hours were?

Ms. Goodpasture. The soviet Embassy changed their |
working hours frequently. Their consulate might be open from |
8:00 to 10:00 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays or they |
might change it from 10:00 to 12:00 on Tuesdays and thursdays /
But for me to say now that in September, 1963, without having |

Ms. Goodpasture, We are talking about. two different

things here, The surveillance, someone was available there,

but they did not make pictures, They may have been watching

a

the activity from 9:00 o'clock in the morning until ‘1:00

o'clock. and may have only made two pictures, one at 11:00

7-1 and one at 12:00.

As far as photographic surveillance being continuous,

C, 20024 (202) $SH-2345

that would be really inaccurate because it was not a camera
making a picture of every minute's. activity.

Mr, Goldsmith, However, there were personnel stationed
at. positions outside the Soviet’ Embassy compound who had

photographic equipment available and who could take pictures

at any time during daylight hours, is that correct?
Ms. Goodpasture . I do not’ know whether it would be or |
not. At vany time during daylight hours? :
Mr. Goldsmith. I am drawing your attention to the

second paragraph of this document, page 1, the very first

sentence of that.paragraph. It. says the photographic

coverage of the mentioned installations is of a continuous

nature during daylight hours. Is that an accurate statement?

because of the sensitivity and he asked me to review the photo:

sloppy in the photographic work.

Mr.. Goldsmith. Nevertheless, did Winn Scott place you

in a supervisory capacity with regard to this project?

9:00 and 10:00 on such and such a date, they usually produced

the photographs for that period,

may have been received by the guard on duty.

Mr, Goldsmith, You are saying now that you are not
sure whether you found the photograph of September 28th?

Ms. Goodpasture. I do not have them here, but I did
get all the photographs of that man, together with the dates
on them, which I think you have, When I was looking here on
this 28th transcript, I said 2eth and what I was “thinking
was that when we checked the photographs. for the days around
the time of the call, we found the photograph, but. I. do not
know what day it was now, right off the top of my head.

Mr. Goldsmith, Did you find a photograph of just one
person who appeared to be North American in appearance?

Ms. Goodpasture. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith, How many days’ photaegradphic surveillance

Mr. Goldsmith. Why did this particular document go to :

Mr. Goldsmith. In. fact, this conversation did come

There were two calls on.the 27th to the Cuban Embassy, |

Mr. Goldsmith,. I will rephrasec the question. It is

apparently that, on September 28, 1963, Oswald, accarding to

this conversation, was at the Cuban Embassy, That is where
the conversation was made from, so at that day he was at the
Cuban Embassy. You indicated that that would not have been |:

Mr. Goldsmith. If it is true that foreigners were
frequently. visiting the embassies on days other than working
days, then why was the photo-surveillance operation confined
to working days?

Ms. Goodpasture. Because the people could not. work
around the clock, They had to havessome time off. One of
the photographers, as I recall, was apart-time student, or
something, but it was not possible to have that thing going

all the time,.

Mr. Goldsmith, - You checked the photosurveillance
materials for approximately a four or five day period, is tha
correct?

Ms. Goodpasture, Yes, I think it is.

Mx. Goldsmith. During that four or five day period
Oswald was the only -- not Oswald. This man was the only
non-Latin appearing man whose photograph you found, is that
correct?

Ms. Goodpasture. I think that it. was the only ‘non-
Latin appearing person's photograph that we found that we

could not identify as somebody else. A lot of the people

_who went to the Soviet Embassy all the time, we came to know

who they were. After they had been identified, they made
frequent visits there.

Mr. Preyer, All right,

Mr. ‘Goldsmith:. For purposes of clarification, the

because during the four or five day period in which the

Ms. Goodpasture, “That is right.

Oswald was considered significantly significant. for Mr.
Karamessinas to be the releasing officer of the cable to the
Mexican station and a voice comparison is made for the purpos
of determining essentially whether Oswald had been to both
the Cuban and the Soviet Embassy. According to your testi-
mony, the results of that voice comparison were that in fact
it was the same person.

Are you saying that the fact that Oswald had been to
Both the Cuban and the Russian embassy was not considered
sufficiently important to notify headquarters prior to the
assassination?

Ms. Goodpasture. No, because af that stage, we had no

‘way of proving that the man who made that call in Mexico was

the same man that this trace was about.

Mr. Goldsmith, The cable from headquarters gives back~ |

ground information on Mr. Oswald, does it not?

Ms. Goodpasturé. Right.

We assumed that it probably was.

Mr, Goldsmith. Right.

After receiving the cable, a voice comparison is made.
It is determined that the same person was talking on each
tape and there is no follow-up to headquarters, even though
headquarters clearly considered this to be significant?

Ms. Goodpasture. The follow-up was made by disseminat-

ing this information from the traces locatly and trying to

the follow up was made. We thought that he may still be in
Mexico.

Mr, Goldsmith, The point is, howevey, that upon the
making of a voice comparison, if, in fact, that was done,
that information was not communicated to anyone,

Ms. Goodpasture, I do not know if it was or not,

You would have to check the file completely, ‘the cable
traffic, to see if it was.’ To the best of my knowledge, it
was not. until after the assassination.

Mr.. Goldsmith. If it were not, would that be -unusual?

Ms. Goodpasture. No.

Mrs Goldsmith, Despite the fact that this was consider
something of significance by headquarters?

Ms, Goodpasture, Headquarters -~ no, because they
could not have done anything with the voice comparison.

Mr. Goldsmith, Perhaps: they could not have done any-
thing with the. voice comparison, but they may have considered
it. to be even more serious had they been informed that not
only had Oswald been to the Soviet. Embassy but he also had
been to the Cuban Embassy.

Ms, Goodpasture, I think they knew that, because the
call from the Soviet Embassy came from the Cuban Embassy.

it immediately?

Ms... Goodpastuté.. So they could find out whether there
was any information there under the name Lee Oswald. That
was the only transcription that he did except for a short
one from the Cuban Embassy staff.

Mr. Goldsmith. .The first. conversation. that came in
involving Oswald apparently. came in on September 27, that
he was not identified by name in that conversation,

Ms, Goodpasture, No, that. is right.

‘Mr, Goldsmith. Was that tape taken to Tarasoff? Is
that the one that.he was asked to transcribe immediately?

Ms. Goodpasture. The one that he was asked to transcrib:
immediately was the one that: had ens name on it. The one ~
that was unidentified, it would also have been taken to him
as. soon as it came off of the machine, and he would have been
asked to transcribe it as soon as he could.

Mr. Goldsmith, I am not. sure I follow you why there
was a need to transcrihe it immediately.-

Ms. Goodpasture,. Pardon me?

Mr. Goldsmith, Why was there a need to have him

' | transcribe it immediately?

a

Ms, Goodpasture, The Lee Oswald one?
Mr. Goldsmith. Yes,
Ms. Goodpasture, The conversation was in Russian, or

broken Russian, but it was in a language that the monitors

inside could not understand. ‘They could not tell if the
man had a: telephone number there or if he had an address
or if he gave more information in the Russian language than
his name.

The only thing they got was his name, which I believe

was in English.

Mr. Goldsmith, Even so, why could they not have waited

for the ordinary lag time to ensure prior to the transcrip-
tion of the recording?

Ms, Goodpasture., Wait a minute, We are talking about
two different things. The reason that he would have been
asked, Tarasoff would have been asked, to transcribe it
immediately would have been because we had a-name connected
with it. Most of Tarasoff's transcription work was trans-
cribing Russian to English, but the conversations were with
persons. who were in the Embassy, Soviet personnel, and in
that process he huilt up a backlog.

So if something came in. that was not. a Soviet or
something other than the people who we knew there talking,
he would have been asked to do that. immediately before the
chit-chat. conversation translations of peaple who were.
liying in the Embassy.

Now do you understand what I am talking about?

Mr. Goldsmith. I. think your explanation is responsive. |

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like, at this point, to refer
to page 6 of the documents contained in Stack C.. In this
regafd, can you identify this particular document?

Ms. Goodpasture. Yes, it is a cover sheet that would
go over a cable in the Mexico. station files.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is this the cover sheet that went with
the. cable that was received from headquartes which gave the
correct description of Oswald?

Ms. Goodpasture., Probably on the llth of October.

That is the date stamped here.

is stamped there with the date of the message, The day it
was received was 12 October which was the day that is

Thatcis why, I think, that he must have wanted it so
that the file would show Lee Oswald and also Lee Henry

Mr. Goldsmith, -If the Committee wanted to verify whethe.
it was standard procedure for Mr. Scott to indicate that a fil

cate that by writing down the word "sicy" I presume that all |
we would have to do is to review cable traffic or routing
sheets to see if that was a matter of routine, he used that |

Ms, Goodpasture. ~You.could if you wanted.

Mr. Goldsmith. If, in fact, it turned out that as a
matter of routine he did not use the terminology "sic" ta
refer to the opening of a file under more than one name, that |

might indicate, would it not, that Scott was aware of Oswald's:

Ms. Goodpasture, In the context of the way the name
Lee Oswald came to our attention the first time, it was in
such a way that we could not tell the man was saying his
name was Lee and Oswald, or. whether his name was Lee Oswald.

Mr. Dodd, What notation was made in that reference

in the cable traffic when the. transcripts -- what notation is

in parentheses?

Ms, Goodpasture. Pardon me?

Mr. Dodd, What notation was in parentheses in the
transcripts of the telephone conversations? Does the word
phonetic, does that strike a bell in parentheses, phonetic?

Ms. Goodpasture, Phonetic, Lee Oswald.

When the transcript was first brought to me, the man

outside, as I recall, said they do not know if this man is

' Lee or whether it is Oswald,

Mr. Dodd. If théy-indicated they did not. understand,
what did they put in parentheses?

Ms, Goodpasture. Before the action was taken on thé
transcript, was taken to thé transcriber who prepared an

In other words, he does not. indicate the file should
be opened up under two names?
Ms. Goodpasture, Right.

Mr. Goldsmith. So really there is no basis at all for

thinking that the term "sic" indiaates what Scott had in mind |

was an "aka" is there? There is no basis for reaching that
conélusion, is there?

Ms. Goodpasture. Would you repeat that again?

Mr. Goldsmith... Certainly.

It is apparent from the routing indication on page 6
that Scott wanted the file opened on Lee Henry. Oswald.

Ms. Goodpasture, Right.

Mr.. Goldsmith. He “gave no indication on the routing
slip that he wanted. the file open upsunder the name Lee Henry

Oswald aka Lee Oswald. There is no indication that the file

was. to be opened up under. two names, In light of that, there |

is really no basis, is: there, for concluding that the use of
the phrase. Sic on page 7 refers to the term aka?

Ms, Goodpasture.. My interpretation that the use of
the word sic was. for the Lee Oswald, the first name in there
on page 7 and that. all of the information about that name
that we did not know the: full name on would go into. the other

Mr. Goldsmith, The "sic" is pointing to the word

Mr. Dodd. What.you just said a moment ago is not

true, then, that there is not a voice comparison?

Ms, Goodpasture, What I said a moment. ago was based on

a-note. that. had been'made in the files, that the transcriber

haddcompared the voices, and this note was written 14 years

ago. |

Mr.. Dodd. Based upon your working knowledge of the

terminology of voice comparison, does that normally inyolve

to make a determination as to whether or not the voices on two,

different tapes are one and the same Berson?

Ms. Goodpasture. The way it was used, to me it would
also mean that a person who had listened to two tapes at
different times and said that they were the same, that it
would be ‘ comparison by hin.

Mr. Dodd, That was considered a-bona fide. voice
comparison?

Ms, Goodpasture, Not in the technical sense that you
are referring to. You are correct,

Mr. Dodd, Counsel, you may proceed, I am awfully
confused about: your statement.

Ms, Goodpasture, I apologize for that. It is a con-
fusion tome of so much material. at. one time, going over it
and the details of it. But I honestly. do not remember being
present when those. tapes were listened to, or a conversation
relating to it, It was this material that came up in the
files. :

Mr... Dodd, “you understand, when you are ‘talking aout
voices being compares, you are comparing a tape of someone
speaking,

Ms, Goodpasture : Right.

Mr,. Dodd, _ You cannot make a comparison based on a

destroyed, by your own testimony,

Counsel, you may proceed.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you.
In. this regard, I would like to refer to Stack B, the
document, page 1 in Stack B, which is the transcript oftthe

conversation in reference to Oswald. That.is Stack B, page

1. This is a transcription of a conversation involving
Oswald that. took place. on 1 October 1963.

By the line which immediately follows the number 151
in brackets it says "the same person who phoned a day or so

ago and spoke in broken Russian."

Viewing this language in connection with page 67 of

Stack C, that is the newspaper article that we were just

referring to --

Ms, Goodpasture. 67.

Mr, Goldsmith. Page 67, the newspaper article that l
we were just referring to. I direct your attention to the |
last paragraph of that article, the one that is marked off,
specifically the one that is adjacent to your marginal nota-
tion.

Would you please read that? |

Ms, Goodpasture, Yes,

Mr. Goldsmith. Might it not be said that, viewing these’
two items together, the language in. this paragraph and the

statement in brackets, the same person-who phoned a day or so

ago and spoke broken Russian, that it was apparent that Oswald}

Yss Goodpastures. Would you repeat that again, please?
Mr. Goldsmith. Viewing these two documents together, Hl

the last paragraph of the article, the language in brackets,

it says, "The same person who phoned a day or so ago and |
|
