American that does not have a constituency and so I decided

agency policy for case officers, for example, to have

Mr, Phillips. Yes. Of course all case officers have i
i a pseudonym. oud |

Mr. Goldsmith, Will you explain to the committee what

the purpose of that pseudonym would be?

Mr.-Phillips. A pseudonym is used so that on records

we

; such as pay papers, all sorts of records that go back and

forth in a powchin cable traffic you can refer to a person

i
i
i
:
i

without actually. using his true name, It is a registered
thing that a person keeps throughout his career unless for
i some reason it is blown, unless it becomes known publicly,

in which case the pseudonym is changed.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would the pseudonym also be used by a

case officer when the case officer contacts an agent?

Mr. Phillips. Very rarely. I don't know that anyone

ever did it. Case officers would not use a pseudonym, A
pseudonym is always a first name, a middle initial and a last
name. A pseudonym can be Jim Smith.

Mr. Goldsmith. So you would distinguish between a

| pseudonym and an operational alias, is that correct?

Mr, Phillips. Absolutely.

Mr. Goldsmith. What was. your pseudonym while you were

| at the agency?

Mr. Phillips. I havé two. My last one was Michael C,

Mr. Goldsmith. And what was your earlier one?

Mr. Phillips. In the operational files.:)“An officer

might use an alias on a one time basis and use the name Jim

“Mr. Phillips. If they do, I was not aware of it.

extent that there was any record of these aliases it would be

could be used again and I do know that the Soviet and Cuban

sentence after that. Would you please read that sentence,

Mr, Phillips,-* "Station to erase routine tapes. Soviet

Mr. Goldsmith. So according to this cable and also to

your testimony, the normal lag would be two weeks and yet we

have an erasure of cable, the Oswald tape, within several days

after its receipt. Based on that do you regard the erasure i

g a ' which might have’ a bearing. I was in Mexico City “doing one \

transcript?

Mr. Phillips.-..This is a transcript of coverage of the

Cuban embassy and apparently what has happened: here is that

there was coverage: at both ends and it looks to me like it is
double tapping of a telephone possibly but this apparently

originated in the Cuban embassy and was tapped there. It is

dan Spanish so it was the Spanish working on the translator.

Mr. Goldsmith; No, this tap would have been off the
phone from the Soviet embassy, would it not?

Mr. Phillips. Yes, I can. see now that it was. Um hum.

Mr. Goldsmith, The reason for that is that it indicates

Mr. Phillips: “-Yes, I see that now.

TESTIMONY OF MR. DAVID PHILLIPS -- Resumed

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Phillips, during the afternoon
recess, have you had the opportunity to read the transcript
that was prepared of your testimony before the Committee in

November of 1976?

Mr. Phillips. Yes, I have.

Mr. Goldsmith. And during the afternoon recess, did you
at any time discuss your testimony before the Committee
this morning with anyone?

Mr. Phillips. I did not.

Mr. Goldsmith. Or contact anyone in any way? i i

Mr. Phillips. I did not. ‘I did. not. j

Mr. Goldsmith. For background purposes I would like
“to indicate to you that the allegations or the issues before
this. Committee ‘are indeed very serious ones. The. Committee
is trying to determine who. killed the. President, whether there

was a conspiracy. Specifically, in the area of Mexico City,

the Committee is trying to determine what. Oswald was doing |

there, if he was there at all.

NW 50955 DocId:32277212 Page 44

into allegations that Oswald was in some way connected
with the U.S. intelligence agency, whether or not Oswald

j
i
|
i
3 | was an agent, whether the Agency was in some way involved
|
ins the assassination. It is an allegation that has been

3 | made, although the Committee is not predisposed in. any way

, |. towards resolving that issue.

The specific question of the cable traffic, the trane-

I
i

Mr. Phillips. I understand that.

u | Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to raise a couple of
questions with you pertaining to your testimony this morning. |

First, do you recall whether or not you actually signed

14 |) Of£ on the cable of October 8th from Mexico City Station to |
|
ig | CIA headquarters? i

Mr. Phillips. I believe now that I did not since I

saw a copy of the cable, which I believe is the one you are

referring to, and I did not see my signature on it.

Mr. Goldsmith. But would you concede that a fair reading

of the record of your testimony in November :would suggest that
i

in fact you did sign off on that cable?

it Mr. Phillipss- That either I signed off on it or certainly

23:1 was aware of its going, yes. Yes.

7s | Mr. Goldsmith. Based upon the transcripts that we

reviewed this morning, I think if we were to review each one

rs) 004s” '

50955 DocId:32277212 Page 45


43

aa

it would be possible to establish that Oswald visited the

Cuban embassy and Russian embassy or consulates a total of

five times. We could go through. each one if you would :

like but are you willing to accept my word for that?

3 i Mr. Phillips. Certainly.

Mr. Goldsmith. In light of the fact that Oswald

|
4 |
Ss ,| i
fei | |
¢ oi | visited these embassies and consulates a total of five i
= i ;
& : | times, is there any explanation. for how the Agency failed
€ H 4 . H
cS | to obtain a photograph of him? |
Ps . i
= Mr. Phillips. First, concerning his visits to the Soviet!

|
| seer
| embassy, until I saw those messages this morning in. which Oswald

i
was saying I have paid a visit to your place, I had thought i
1

until this morning that. Oswald never -- that we didn't have |
any record of the fact that he actually visited the Soviet \

| embassy in person, which of course would explain why there

| was no photograph of him. “ha

The. explanation as far as the Cuban embassy was concerned!

jiwas that there was photographic coverage.of the consulated

'9 | and as I. recall it, he visited on a Friday when that camera

aoa 1H

was not in -- was not working.

The explanation for the following day, the Saturday, would

‘be that at that time we didn't photograph people who went in /
F i
|
/on weekends. Afterwards I think Saturday coverage was instituted

4 | because of. the. Oswald thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. Okay.

4 : : 44

I don't -- I amanot sure that your answer was completely

ry

responsive to my question. The-first part of your answer was

that until you reviewed the*cable traffic or transcripts, you

were not aware of the visit to the Soviet embassy.

Mr. Phillips. That's correct. I --

Mr. Goldsmith. But that. doesn't indicate, that doesn't ”

explain why, if there was surveillance of the Soviet embassy,

N

Mr. Phillips. Yes. The only -- what I am trying to
say is that in my mind the only explanation was that he
indeed did not visit. the Soviet embassy in person. I thought.
that he did’ not:

Mr Goldsmith. But assuming that he did, as I believe |
the transcripts demonstrate -- |

Mr. Phillips. There. should have been a ere

Mr. Goldsmith. And to your knowledge was there such a

picture?

Mr. Phillips. No, I never saw a picture of Lee Harvey i

Oswald, and I -- it was my -- I have always believed that

no picture. of him existed.

Mr. Goldsmith. After the assassination, was. Win»Scott
upset about the failure of the photo surveillance units to
obtain photographs of Oswald?

Mr. Phillips. I am sure I can say that he was disappointed.

7 7 Mr. Goldsmith: And I believe in your testimony of i

; November of '76. you indicated. that the photograph that was |

obtaindd. that.was mistakenly linked to Oswald was. linked.

to him because had a stranscript before her.

|

The transcript. indicated someone was going to the Soviet
embassy to obtain.a visa, and she had a picture of a man

who left.the embassy at about that. time, okay?

Mr. Phillips. Yes, that was my understanding of why

this. message went out in sort of two parts.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do.you know if the Agency made any
effort to identify other non-Latins whom it saw either enteri
or leaving the Soviet or Cuban consulates or embassies?

Mr. Phillips. You mean generally or in the specific

case of this unidentified --

Mr. Goldsmith. In the. specific case of. the Oswald

issue.

Mr. Phillips. I obviously, I don't know what. might have |

been done at headquarters, and I don't recall specifically

of an effort made in Mexico, but answering your question. in

it was, and what steps were actually taken, I don't know.

i Mr. Goldsmith. For p es of clarification, by my

question I meant when they made reference to that picture in

to coming up with the conclusion that this picture was

who. visited those embassies?

2no24 (202)

Mr. Phillips. Yes, that was pretty standard procedure.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like to get back and deal with

ray

another matter that was raised this morning.

12 How soon after the first intercept:did“youzreceive the

transscript of Oswald's conversation?

Mr. Phillips. I don't recall precisely. Generally it

& was a matter of -- they came pretty rapidly. It seems to me,

= the next day or say within two days, something like that

a was the normal time, but you will recall my previous

testimony that that. transcript concerning his visit. to the

Cuban embassy only was really important to us after the

goo

assassination, so I can't recall the date that I first saw
it.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, you do recall receiving. that

transcript prior to the time. that the cable was sent out,

* | the cable I am referring to, the cable of October 9th, 1963?

which. was in Spanish;,in other words, coming from the Cuban.
embassy, so I am sure that.Isaw. it. But I also have the

recollection that it didn't “mean anything to me, I am sorry

to say; until after the assassination. when it was tied in with

previous conversations. ie

(Pause)

Mr. Goldsmith. For summary purposes, then, it would
appear that if standard procedure was. followed, you. would.
have teceived that transcript. within a few days te the
intercept having been made?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. | And your recolléction, I. guess, based
both upon. the. testimony from November of '76 that you read
this afternoon, and any further thoughts that. youvhad, is
that you did in fact recéiveythis transcript prior to the
time. that the cable went out October 9th, '63.

Mr. Phillips. I am sure I must have. I don't recall

specifically that I dids. As I explained before, I was in

was sort.of the detail man on these cuban operations, at

trying to make a living by lecturing. I was on television

ae

S

about,.or the one transcript in particular that you discussed,

Es 5 | your last. statement.

3 é First, we have a situation here where there are conflicts,

E 7 | between your version. of the cables as described in your |

é 3 il téstimony in 1976 and the cables we showed you today. We

S 3 l| also have conflicts between the transcripts. that you talked |

i
i

and those. that we showed you today, and we. have a situation
i

where. you were absent from Mexico City, and yet. you told the

s | cable, that. you had had a conversation wit} and |
| also that you had in fact. seen. the transcript when you couldn’ t
|

have seen it until sometime. after that.. i
i
i Your explanation I believe in part is that. you attribute:
H i
| this. to a conversation that you had with a newspaper man, and

|
also that before the Committee you overdramatized your : i

|| role.

Is that an accurate statement?

Mr. Phillips. I hope that I didn't do it. before the i

Mr. Goldsmith. ‘What.‘does the term "covert. action" mean?

Mr. Phillips. In. its .broadest sense, it is the propaganda,
4 : |
| political, action type thing. In this case, primarily it

i had to do with Cuba because the Cuban. embassy-in Mexico City |

i i
was.a focal point for their propaganda activities, and throughdut

}on a witting level, would. you characterize him as an agent or

as. an asset?

Mr. Phillips. Generally as an agent. I think it would

in a group here in. Washington with people from different

| agencies, you might say we. have an asset who can. arrange this,

| but certainly in-house you would be more inclined to say:

Mr. Goldsmith. How specifically would you carry out a

}. doing: that?

Mr. PRillips. Well, often the. stories you wanted to

headquarters, perhaps just from Mexico, perhaps worldwide,

DocId: 32277212

Mr. Goldsmith.. Now, when you “'dealt with one of your

Mr. Phillips. I never used my pseudonym. The pseudonym

was for internal CIA use, and I always used an alias except
| in those some cases. when I used a true. name, but I. always

| used. an alias.

Mr. Goldsmith: And how many operational aliases did you

say that. you may have had?

Mn. Phillips. Well, over a period of 25 years I suppose

| a hundred.

Mr. Goldsmith. And how would that work? You would have

| one alias that you would use with one individual and another

alias. that you would use with a second individual?

Mr. Phillips. Yes. Sometimes you would -- if you moved

alias you had used before simply because it was something you |
H : \
| could remember, so you might. ‘use it. with more than one agent. |

| Often you would try and choose ‘something that started at

Mr. Goldsmith. Was that standard practice for case officers

Mr. Phillips. Yes.'I:think it generally would be

a long, long time with.a number of different. people. So

Mr. Goldsmith. But if- you.used’as many as a hundred,

I used with a particular individual?

circumstances, and the second time this morning when.I°-- I !
presume that that was Antonio Veciana who came out of the
hearings this morning while I was waiting in the hall. i

Mr. Goldsmith. And when was the first time that. you met

Mr. Veciana?
Mr. Phillips. If the man I am talking about, the man who}
was there this morning, is Mr. Veciana, I first met him on

the 18th of Séptember of 1976’. whensthe Association of Former

Intelligence Officers«wasshaving a convention at the Reston

Schweiker's office could come to our convention, and so of

course I said yes, we would be delighted to have them.

They arrived for lunch and so I had‘them sit at my table. i
One was a Mr. Fonzi.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fonzi?

Mr. Phillips. Fonzi. One was a young lady whose name

I don't recall, and..one was a man who was introduced to me only |

about the Kennedy assassination, and I said fine, how long

will it take? And he said, it will take a couple of hours.

HW 50955 DocId:32277212 Page 89

And I said really, that. is very difficult for me because

I. was in charge of the convention and we were ‘trying to. make our

schedule, but I did step into the hall, and at that time the |

w

i man I believe} to be Antonio Veciana put questions to me in

&

$ | Spanish, and we chatted for a while in Spanish. They. left and

I called Senator. Schweiker's office, and said I have just
fae ;

been. asked questions about. the assassination in Spanish. Is

Mr.-Phillips. Because after I saw the magazine, in June

this gentleman:came out to see mew... Then I read an exact -~ the

again for us how it was, according to your assessment,

based on the cable traffic that’ you had before you; the copies

of the cable traffic, anyway, and your own recollection; how.
it. was that. the word. "Henry", “Lee Henry Oswald" happened
to appear in the. cable traffic, and then, of course, the

Have any of these people ever served as your assets or

assassin?

we

Mr. Phillips: Sir, it is obvious that I don't. have

| the information that you do, especially about Dallas..

é | But it is my. belief that until I see some other evidence
g 7 | to the. contrary, God knows I would like for it.to come out
: 2 i that Fidel Castro was responsible:or that the Soviets were
§ 3 | responsible because there are so. many people, especially on
a i

Di college campuses who are convinced the CIA did it. I found

myself being accused publicly of perjury before the Congress
i : 5 : ;
by Mark. Lane during debates on college campuses, so I would
like for something like:this to come out, but I know of no
| evidence to show that the Cubans of the Soviets: put.him up to
it, and I just have to go along on the side that he was a
kind of a loony fellow who decided to shoot the President, an
he did. I. just have to come. down on. that.

In a caseson the west coast, two women tried separately
to assassinate President Ford within a very short time of

each. other. We never hear the slightest suggestion that ther:

was a conspiracy, and the reason, I believe, is ‘that..they

issed. Lee Harvey Oswald didn't miss, and the American public

doesn't. want to. believe that one man. could murder Camelot. i
