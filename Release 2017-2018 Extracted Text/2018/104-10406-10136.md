3. DEFINITIONS

Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply.
Speeial note must be taken of the fact that the key term “operational use”

__ employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the most succinct

*

manner consistent-with clarity. It has not been feasible; Bowever, to cover in -
a definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances
which may be encountered in DDO activities. The definition of “operational
use” is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be
employed with responsible operational judgment. Issues involving a deter-
mination of “operational use” which cannot be resolved with reasonable as-
surance by the responsible operating components will be referred to the
Deputy Director for Operations for decision.

‘a. Operational Use”

Operational use is interpreted to mean the recruitment, utilization, or train-
ing of any individual or group for DDO purposes on either a witting of
unwitting basis by or on’ the’ behalf of an element of the Operations Direc-
torate. Utilization is'made of an individual or group whenever that in-
dividual or group, responding to the direction or solicitation of a DDO
element, provides information, performs services, provides cover, or supplies
financial, material, or other support necessary for the accomplishment of
DDO operational objectives either directly or indirectly, to or for an ele-
ment of the Operations Directorate.

b. DDO Element
Any person or group who or which is responsible to, owned or controlled
either directly or indirectly by the Operations Directorate. Included under
this definition are employees or members of Agency proprietary mech-

c. Operational Contact
Any association having as its purpose the initiation or furtherance of DDO
operations.
