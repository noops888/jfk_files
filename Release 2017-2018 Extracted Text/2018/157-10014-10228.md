OCCURRENCE:

BISSELL said that the philosophy described by the Chief of the CIA Africa Division, probably

BRONSON TWEEDY, in a memorandum in late 1960, was probably applicable to matters within the

scope of Project ZRRIFLE. The memorandum recommended the agent WIROGUE in these terms:

"He is indeed aware of the precepts of right and wrong, but if he Is given an assignment,

which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the world, but necessary because his case officer

ordered him to carry it out, then it is right, and he will dutifully undertake appropriate

action for its execution without pangs of conscience. In a word, he can rationalize all

actions" (59).

will not begin until mid-July. The program was to be directed at four major

segments of the Cuban economy: (a) electric power (b) petroleum refineries and

storage facilties (c) railroad and highway transportation (d) production and

manufacturing." The purpose of this and other programs is to "nourish a spirit

of resistance and disaffection which could lead to significant defections and

other by-products of unrest. " :

"The device or the doctrine of plausible deniability" (5) was explained by

Bissell: for any covert operation that was likely to have a visable consequence

one objective was to carry out such operations

"in such a way that they could

be plausibly disclaimed by the U.S. government." (5)

i PRESIDENTIAL DENIABILITY: "To protect the President" (5) Allen Dulles woma

have attempted "to have indicated to the two successive presidents the general

--objective of the operation that was contemplated, to make that sufficiently

clear so that the President--either President Eisenhower or President Kennedy

could have ordered the termination of the operation, but to give the President

r, just as little information about it as possible beyond an understanding of

its general purpose.

purpose to leave him in the position to deny knowledge of the operation if

should surface." (5-6) Bissell believed, based on "my knowledge of command*"

• relationship, of Allen Dulles as an individual, and of his mode of operations--

is that authorization was obtained by him in the manner that I have indicated"

(6): 1.e., "circumlocutions" (5)

Rissell uses this theory of plausible deniability as his explanation for the a

reason that neither he nor anyone else in the Agency would have discussed an

assassination operation on their own initiative with members of the White

House Staff.

"The effort would have been to hold to the absolute minimum

the number of people who knew that the President had been consulted, had been

notified, and had given, perhaps only tacitly, his authorization." (6)

HARVEY testified that he could envision two circumstances in which assassinations would be

justified. First, on proper orders from the proper highest authorities in cases of utter

mentioned that it might be necessary to eliminate a Cuban leader to protect the United States

believed that assassination would be proper in the case of treason, where

not eliminating the person might lead to the loss of many lives or of a life more important

HARVEY emphasized that in the case of threats to national security, assassinations

should always be authorized by the President. In the case of assassinations necessary to

protect the resources of the Agency, he felt that authority might better be derived fron

parties other than the President to

In this case each of the alternatives was rejected. But the format seems to

indicate that such alternatives are considered frequently by the CIA in dealing

with the disclosure or potential disclosure of a covert operation.

Bissell recalls that this is true (p. 49), but he cannot

Bissell places this request in early 1961. (p. 50).

Bissell

remembers assigning William Harvey the task of developing

the Executive Action program, but he does not remember the

requests from the White House (p. 50). Bissell suggests

that the requests might have come from Bundy (p. 49) or

Walt Rostow (p. 51).

Bissell does not deny the truth of

the quote from Harvey that he, Bissell, stated that he

received two requests from the White House to set up the

ZRRIFLE assassination capability. But he does not remember

specific conversations (p. 51) .

In response to the increasing requirements for the operational procurement of foreign

code and cipher materials, division A in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as a

developmental activity. During the same period requirements fran NSA became more

refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped

to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize

control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest

touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting

activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the O0A category. (exhibit

The EXECUTIVE ACTION program authorized by BISSELL and run by WILLIAM HARVEY "came to be known

as ZRRIFLE. Its principal asset was an agent, QJWIN, who had been recruited earlier by ARNOLD

SILVER for use in a special operation in the Congo (the assassination of PATRICE LUMUMBA) to be

run by JUSTIN O'DONNELl. (O'DONNELL made a survey of the scene, decided he wanted no part in

that assassination attempt, and asked to be released - which BISSELL granted.)" (38)

This is a quote from the document entitled Nine Pages from

the Inspector General, 21 May 1973.

Note: Check this quote against the original document. It

is important to locate the document referred to as "the first

recorded approval" for ZR/RIFLE in order to determine whether

the White House requests for the establishment of an assassina-

here, or around May 1962. Note further that all of my

references to the initial White House requests for the

OCCURRENCE: Harvey was asked about notes written by him and Silver from their

meeting in January of 1901, concerning Executive Action. One portion of the notes

stated,

"Be within KUBARK, one focal point for control, search, training, case

officering; etc. -- GDP authority in this focal point mandatory. DCI officially

advised?" (57)

Harvey testified that he did not know whether the DCI was advised,

that he had been asked to create a capability for Executive Action and had taken

certain steps to have an assessment of assets in that connection. (57)

clarified that the wording of the memo probably meant that consideration should be

given to the question of how, whether and under what circumstances the DCI should be

officially advised of his program, "I want to make it clear that this in no way

means he should be advised.

he should not be advised, he should never be advised,

he should always be advised." (59).

The notes in Harvey's handwriting entitled Project Zrriffle state "3. Background:

In response to the increasing requirements for the operational procurement of foreign

code and cipher materials, division a in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as a

develoymental activity.

During the same period requirements from NSA became more

refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped

to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize

control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest

touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting

activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the OOA category. (exhibit

Harvey testified that his notes didnot cite assassination or assassination capability as

an objective of project Zrriffle. However, assassination was a contemplated purpose of the

project. If an agent had been recruited for assassination he would have been recruited

under the cover of obtaining code and cipher materials.
