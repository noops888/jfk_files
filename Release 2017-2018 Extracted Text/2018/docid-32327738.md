It is anticipated that PCI DIAZ will be turned

over to the FBN,

Miami, during May, 1968. His potentia

appears

to lie clearly

in the narcotics field; he has

expressed a desire to infiltrate and work among narcotics

figures in Miami. During contacts with DIAZ, it became

evident he is personally acquainted with many narcotics

subjects.

He particularly objects to the ilk of JUAN

GARCIA using the cause of Cuban patriotism as a cover

When DIAZ is introduced to

FBNg Miami,

arrangement will be made to retain some
