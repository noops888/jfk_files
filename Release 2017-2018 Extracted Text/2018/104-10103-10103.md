Tadeusz SZULC

[hal o—

The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have

been destroyed, I attach, however, a memorandum consisting of

selected entries from his card,

2 All the information is from the some source, a Polish emigre
who knew SZULC personally and.also had, informants in the Polish Embassy.
3. There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-communist at the time,
and that he co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed

by the Press Section'of .the Polish Enbassy, and provided him with
"information", , It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion
that: this collaboration took the form of espionage, since SZULCs does

not seem to have made any secret of the relationship,

cake" “Egan find no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence
officer ’ but he seems to have been an active propagandist. He returned
to Poland in 1954, A report from the same source, dated June 1956,
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs.
