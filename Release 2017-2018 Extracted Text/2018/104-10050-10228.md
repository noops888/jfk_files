SU"JECT: elay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the dela (ty the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
mame Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
we of laziness on the part of the Soviet. case officer (which

view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know vhat he was’ talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 Octo:
convers ation would have been picked up on the morning-of he
2nd of October. ‘The Russian language portion would’Rave.gone
to the Rusian/English transcriber on the 3rd ofOctober. ‘the
translation would have been returned the follawing.day (4th)
at which time, the Soviet case officer wouhd have“ ked for
the photograph ic coverage. ‘That coverag@\'s Td not have been
in the station before the 7th since the fiJm was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and ii® was ‘picked up probably on |
the 4th, processed and passed ‘tation on the next work i
day vhich would have been M

3. Later the film was en out of the camera every. day
but at that time, the film stayed in the camera until a full a
rotl was completed which might take three or four days.

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is ay
of the name alone but that wasn't the wy Win Scott ran that :
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
teleth one coverage ..s ometimes_there_was. a U.S. automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of
justifying a project ly the number of dispatches, cables or
Teports - produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage: . i
From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 unti1
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTI cies of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a magn

of Tines tapped ee only by the availability of a listening post aot

nearby and. the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Porat

lance team and a

Czech,. etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

- American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

+ assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
‘on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-.
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental ;
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
“ graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

‘on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site oe middle of

° the block south. It had a planted view of tl jate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third proroaS ae

row of four houses on the naga Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the, 8 of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
‘ purpose of this over Sek s to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re~

s located in one of a

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8-x 10:contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral m = operation,

2. Liaison Coverage @
Liaison ees unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction
of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was.a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. Their agents were saeKetel - and corrupt. A Station
officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In
1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

Operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

RET /SCUSNE

as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines
connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican
Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-
cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post.
3. Oswald Coverage:
In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

Joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the ENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban‘Sr

disconnected a1] of the unilateral 1s taps on thesé Embassies so

an’ the Mexicans hooked up their

that. they would not be disc
taps. The Mexicans cae connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czeth lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the listening post, a live monitor made. short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

sy a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated
equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-
ficulties.

27 September 1963, Sovict Embassy Chancery 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if,

the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET:

DURAN:
SOVIET:

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly’: _fhis man
(the American), “: showed him a letter inwhich he” (the
American) is a member of an organizatj@h'itt.favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not givel him ‘the visa without
the Russian visa and now the et “qoesn' t know what to do
with him, because he has ae ‘the answer from
Washington.

..with them also, be ste ‘problem with him (the American)

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take ‘long time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

«that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to retum to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

is that he doesnt, \3arlyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very ia ve him a visa, because he was

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they ‘do not know if the visa will be approved.
They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
T-don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours 4 man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
Anerica, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN,
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
Know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping:tepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa infomation..’First
a call was made to the first listing for the Soyiet.Enbassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned ougeta ‘be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate and‘he address. After
making a call to the Consulate and leaninj\ that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went. x@thevddress to get the needed

~ Item 395, pages 7 and 8 wey es

Just after 1600 hours, Ye Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and
has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call

in order to change that address and asks for the name
of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

_Dear Dick:

3 Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some
‘from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though GIA and the
FHI have detailed records concerning Americans who have bean recruited
as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be

* a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries
who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCID L/2,
these. persons might be described as those who have either been,
capable of provicing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose
desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited <*
for communist propoganda purposes, This would mean that no attention :
need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter~intelligence implications or had attracted no particular
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual ;
US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the
homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated inte

, the Anerican society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18
months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the
Departnents 3

Sincerely yours,
