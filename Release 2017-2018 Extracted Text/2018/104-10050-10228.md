From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Poli

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians.on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy. (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

• Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed

by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars

and

a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy.

These agents were aware of

foreigners. Their agents were wind retailt, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. From the time the lexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1955, Charles

Anderson III (still in IA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Fa

exoloit leads from the Soviet Enbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Thone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone company

transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostly noc

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the help

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA). LINITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base vas closed

when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being

released

to the

public by the Warren Cormission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The property was sold. (under an operational agreenent with LIMOUSITE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

lexican farilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South sigenof the Soviet Embassy compound

witch the jaded Stetion purdrason la about 1958. (oreck date), also using

LIOUS IME as the purchager latect) This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Enbassy compound.

The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (who at thet time vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites vere handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S, mother who taught elerentary level at

the American School). Ramon collected the film gaile

him from LEITED

and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husband, Carlos (Mexican doctor)

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips. The master plan

tuit

vas for LICALLA film to ve processed inside, TSD man from 1957 to 1959 (Harper

to accumulate, the inside Co (iahoney) became disgusted and took the film out

for Ramon's brother-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus Ramon became

the handler for all three photo bases.

During this period, the U.S.

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former lexi President), acting

of a shakedown.

of deceit and corruption. LIELEGANT also

About nid 1962 (check date) Litroy outside "ext rept asked

for the telephone nunvers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Embassies.

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish,

and 1 lugoslav line. The baserouse listening post had a live

monitor lino made short sunnaries of interesting conversations for a caily

resume which was

received each day arourd 8 a.f. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to

Scott before 9 a.m.) Later (when the reel

was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed ard passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so.: Those transcripts which iad

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations.on the

reel) was

typed.

These reels were taken to another location vera

were translated

and typed.

In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date

'Sigversation because of the volure of

Russian conversations

amo

de-embers of the Soviet Erbassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manell and his wife Berbara

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. ly job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Anerican. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three tines a week but the ones picked up were usually

for dates a few days prestiously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other vords the

tin

operators cleared the canera each day whether there was angeline a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograch each

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcripts every made in languages other than Spanish

27 September 1963, Sovict Embassy Chancery 15-01-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN.

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he

still here.

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to sta)

a long time with his wite who 1s Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

that accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

and even then, they could not issue the visa here?in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet accordingly this man

(the American) ,

showed him a letter in which he (the

American) is a member of an organization im favor of Cuba

and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Seet doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has towas

Washington.

..with them

also, bec

the problem with him (the American)

is that he doesn

wearyone in Cuba and in that case it

is very diffi

cogive him a visa, because he was

thinking of pp

sessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take a" long time waiting for the Russian visa in

Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET:

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)

she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

permission,

for example, here or in any other place (he) can

receive it,

but right now they do not have them.

DURAN:

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET:

DURAN:

SOVIET:

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN:

It was no bother, thank you very much.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulatc 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks

for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate

calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory)

and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA"' will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest.:

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping+ representatives

for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the

first listing for the soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned outta be the Military Attache.

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate

received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN)

who said

she had

there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he

is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of)

Inmigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address

so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEMBER AUSEARLY OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBAN TRANSIT VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT-

2. PLEASE RESTUDY YOUR LIENVOY MATERIAL AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION,

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though GIA and the

FBI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Blos countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete. Listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DID 4/2,

these. persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of proviaing ussiul intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for cormunist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counterintelligence inplications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because

they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society®

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of Interested Bureaus of. the

Department.

Sincerely yours,.

Mr' Zagleh: On questions A, B, C, D-be vas not questioned on any of those.

We bara been taid the police didn't du re flaally got access to lasa

We weren't given

authority to nove in until fiday so those questions were not covered.

With regard to E - Mrs., Paine, etc., we are working on that.

F - we have some infornation for you on that indicating communication

between him and the Embassy up there.

'Ihe wife is being interrogated. I don't know if that took place yesterds

or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I am

just giving you a preview.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's, allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Embassy On 18 Segtember, I understand we do have infermation that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtember. There is a

record showing entry into Mexico on Septenber 26. On about the 15th he

applied in New Orleans for a tourist cast.

We do know he was 1n -

I may even have some later inferation which came in during the algat -

As you kaow, he was in them arleas

He was last seen by the landlady

Now we have immigration records saowing him

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that be was not in Mexico

on the l8th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back.
