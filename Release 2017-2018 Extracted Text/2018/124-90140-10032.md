very disturbed

because he has not been contacted by the Agency.

It was emphasized to Mrs. Roman that certain commitments allegedly

had been made to

and he 1s waiting for action

Mrs. Roman conferred with other CIA representatives and

dvised that the Agency had notspeen able to arrange the prope

type of assignment for

interested in him. She further stated that a CIA

official would

be contacting

Based upon

his discussions at CIA,

the Liaison Agent

received the impression that this matter is being very poorly

handled by the Agency. It has an excellent opportunity to acquire

the services of an unusual source but certainly does not appear to ab

be giving this the proper type of attention. even if the Agency

did not have an assignment arranged for

CIA at least could

be maintaining contact with him

that

nis attitude would continue

to be friendly and cooperativel
