2. There little question that LIRING?3 aust often ask himself
just where his association vith ROWFON is taking him end must speculate
about just whet ROWFGM ie after. There are obviously times when, loft
to conjectures and suppositions, LIRING?3 aust feal like "quieting."

Yet, the ascandancy gradually dovaloped by ROWEON over LIBING®3 has

reached the point where LERING@3 is unwilling to go back to the drab,
uninteresting life he lived before meoting ROWION, The result of LIRING-3's
“second thoughts” has up to now been a de » io the end, to collaborate
even more closely with ROWZON. ROWTON's report dated 13 May, end more

= aeddigion LIRING"3, a profesciona! artict, finds himself tavolved io
the develepasnt of « comnarefal venture, on undertaking for which he te

41] equipped. This c2key ehortccaing requires very close guidance by
ROWEGH and, in turn, meskes LINING"3 oven more dependont on hie case officer,
Thus, while LERING-3 occactonally thinks of returning tp pointing end

jens end develope qualms sbout taking sonsy from ROWFGS for

IRIEO*3 keepo involving himself
deeper and deeper in activitios of interest to ROWTOH.

Se Fhe above does not moan that LIRIRO-3's eotivitics chould ant
be oubjected to every operations] control possible, on the contrary.
LEREGO"3's story concerning the manner in vhich birth cortiffestes can
be obtained in Northern Hexico to secure valid Mexican paseporte continues,
for axample, to be suspect, It mow appears, on the other head, that
"QARCIA" of the Quatemslan FAR exicte (LIRINO-4 talked to him) ead that
be does cot want LIRINO"3 to come in contact vith other Kexico residents
connected with the Gustemslen guerrilles cuch ae the alleged PAR propeganda

LIRING and it’s staff paid off whon LIRINO4 woo asked to “£111 in” vheo
one of the va arios in LIRING"9's section had to return home temporsrily
on sick loa It already appears that LIRING?4, en experienced hand tn
LIMING-9'e overt business, will be given quite o bit of rosponeibilicy in
that office, It 48 hoped that by becoming quaei indicponcable she vill
be ooked to remain et LIRING ofter the roturo of the parson for vhoa che
fy "€illing in.” LIRING*4, while vory much in love with ber husband, has
a aind of her own, 9 grest liking for ROWFOY ond, according to LIRIRG=3
bimself, an iotelligonce much suporior | to his, She is alco gifted with
Oriental type potience, with LIRING"3"s knowledge, ROW?0H hse ctarted
to make small payments to LERIGG*4 to provide separate financial incentive
end help her pay for furniture and other items she purchased on credit
some time egos

3. The ckotch mentioned in the last paregraph of RCWTON*’s report
dated 26 May wae retained by thie Station, ROWEON used this sketch to
discuse with LIRING@4 the layout of LIBIBG°9's' section, The etetement
made at the end of paragraph 4 of the report dated 27 May fo fm error,
LIRING"9"s section has two telephones, What LIRIHG-4 took for a third
