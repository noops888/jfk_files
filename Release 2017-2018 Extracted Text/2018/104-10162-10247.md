Decause, as a member of the Mis, thie was considered as equivalent
to military service. Nonetheless, in response to my‘query, Subject
sdmitted that this ves umsusl as his activities vere .t a kind vhich
vere perfomed by old voren rarticulerly ince during period,
from October 1941 to September 1942, all able-bodied Soviet males
were drafted into the Soviet amy. During this period Scbject lived
in comparstive ease, being assigned to Suzdal and Klin, end other
towns, According to Su>ject, be wore an MD uniform but wore no
insignia. He adzitted that “fevored treatzent” was bestoved upon
him end his fenily vhen the iD assisted him in evacuating his first
wife and son fron Moscow in Augast 1941 to beyond the Urals. (His
son by his first wife reportedty died on 11 Cctober 1953 of diabetes.)

k. In September 1942, Subject received an appcintzent to the
Moscow 2nd Militery Irfentry Institute fron which he greduated in Jime
Woke 4 oy te sho < Ge Lb in ike Sovier
Infantry. In response to ny cuery, Subject again admitted that this
appointment was highly unusual as his background did not lend itself
to this, as appointzents vere rede out of tae various military
branches, and as this ‘mplied t, as a foreiser (American), he vas
fully end completel; trusted ty the Soviet punitive orgens who had.
cleared him both for this training and the institute end for promotion
to officer status in the Soviet Army. 1

1, Initially he'ves sent to Alatey on the Volga, then to Orel
wiere ia was assigned to the front lines in August 1942. He was given a
Platoon of infantry troops in the 415th Infentry Divisicn of the
Sovzet Central Front. Sovever, in October 1943 he was wounded; he was
hit in the left forehead by e German bullet. Ee was operated on in
a field hospital ana then transferred to a Moscow hospital after he
hed recovered sufficiently. He vas reclassified after kis recovery
and found suitable to continue in military service wita the limitation
that be should not serve oa the front lines (goden vtoroi stepeni).

m, Because the wound faited to heal completely (he bas a very
obvious scar, with azproximately a 1" depression, on his forehead),
he “asked” to be assigned to a varmer clirate. The Soviet authorities,
he states, complied and in January 1944 dispatched him to Tbilisi
vbere he vas placed in a specia! officer's camp; he wes hospitalized
again, tad osteozyelitis complications, and ultimately discharged from
the Soviet military forces. Eovever, Subject provided several
contradictory stories a to the date of discharge vhich st various
times he indicated occurred in May 194h, then in July 19:4, and even
in Augest 194, (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story tothered, him
es it was obvious to the undersigned that Subject had somevhere become ,
confused in this aspect of his tackground.)

n. Upon his discharge, he vas retumed to the Moscow erea vhere
he was placed in a rest hor» (although Subject admitted thet there
really existed no need for this as he bot recovered already prior
to kis discharge). Ia continuing his narration, Subject indicated
that the rest of his story "sounds very strange and unbelievable"
but then averred that it vas true. He states that, stranze as it
appears and despite the shortage of Soviet men at the time (194k)
he could not “find” hinself a Job. Ze vent to the MiD which did
offer kin a job in Veliki Luki on the higtvays with the ScyuDorog-

3 however, he was not given the job by the officiats
Fespousible for this. As a result, he appealed directly to the
Minister of the HiD vio “tried to intercede” in Subject's behalf.
Allegedly after he ves given a full physical exenination, he vas told
that he could not te assigned to the highvay units for reasons
which vere not speiisi our vo Suaject.

0. Subject then "sought out" vork with the Nauchniy Sovet vith

no luck. Ee ultinately chtainei a Job vith the Moscow Sove in the
Moscov Soiiet Senior Librazy (aie). Ia fovesber 19s, at 8 salary
of 900 rubles, Subject began vorking in the field of "information

His work also incluted working on abstracts and translaticcs from
English to Russian, primarily in the field of dams, dam construction,
end hydraulics.

p. In Jume 1949 Subject states that be was dismissed from the
foregoing position after he vas given the explanation that the flow of
Literature from the USA, vhich Subject vas translating, hed decreased.
In actual fact, Subject states, he was being “purged” because he vas
aJev. Ee then found a job as a laboratory assistent in a concrete
Plant vbere he vorked fron July 1949 to 23 February 1950. Because
he did not like that Job, Subject states he wrote to Stalin personally
as a result of which, within less than 4 weeks, he was offered 4.5
different Jobs. The positions vere offered to him by the Moscow
Comittee of the CP to vhon “Stalin hed forvarded the letter". In
reply to ny query, Subject stmitted that he was not concerned that, |
dy writing to Stalin, be vould came to the attention of the Soviet
punitive organs, MVD/MGB, which vould undertake to investicate his
case. Accordingly, on 1 April 1950 Subject waa given a job ds en

5. Because Bubject had cormmicated to his father, using
“hidden phrases” in to letters ts each other, about his vish to
