COMMENTS:

Bary, «

Attached are the final versions of the DS&T and DO briefing questions. There are no changes in
the DS&T questions. Questions have been added to the DO list to reflect our conversation
March 19 and 20. You, of course, already have our detailed explanations for the earlier DO
questions. If you have any questions or if there are any problems, please give me a call. I should
be in all day. See you tomorrow,

Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
April 1, 1997

1, At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton‘s
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI’s office was notified."

(p. 143) Where are these records?

2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retixed records at the CIA’s
Record’s Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?

3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?

4, Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199 from
1959-1964?

5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald’s visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?

7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?

9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?

10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?

11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?

12. Is there a comprehensive record ot list detailing the identities of individuals on the
How are these records organized? How can a search

: ery be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the

13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular
individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?

14, ARRB’s Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-13, dated
November 1, 1996, contained the following questions:

A. What forms of backchannel communications were there between the
Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters
during 1963? By “backchannel” we mean, inter alia, any administrative,
senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or
electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the
type included in the JFK Collection).

B. Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico

City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963?

C.. To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963 (other than
those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records
available for review.

Why has it been so difficult to answer these questions?

15. ARRB’s Request for Additional Information and Record No. CLA-14, dated
December 23, 1996, documented our request for the annual or biannual Station reports
for Mexico City Station for 1963 and 1964. Why has it been so difficult to provide these
reports?

16. The attached Agency document released in 1996 contains the paragraph:
11. A memorandum marked only for file, 16 March 1967, signed M.D.
Stevens, says that J. Monroe SULLIVAN, #280207, was granted a covert
security approval on 10 December 1962 so that he could be sed in Project
QKENCHANT. (Clay) Shaw has # 402897-A.
What do these numbers mean? What does the “A” at the ends of Shaw’s number
signify? - Do the files identified by these numbers still exist? Why was Sullivan granted
a covert security approval?
17. During the period 1959-1963, what was the purpose or goal of QKENCHANT?

18. Under what circumstances were non-agency employees given covert security
clearances for the QKENCHANT project?

19. Did Clay Shaw receive a covert security approval for the QKENCHANT project?
Why was one needed? Did Clay Shaw receive covert security clearances for any
project other than QKENCHANT

20. What did Clay Shaw do within the QKENCHANT project?

21. Do records exist to account for the disposition of all files on Clay Shaw?

22. Did Howard Hunt have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior to
1964?

23, Did J. Monroe Sullivan have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior
to 1964?

sinea.25 Moy 1956 Mr, Hunter: Leake had seen SHAW casually,
by chanca, in various downtown New Orleans xestaurants,
and greetings were exchanged. The last such casual
encounter was just bafore SHAW's retirement in 1965.

9. On 7 March 1967 Pravda published an article -
galled “Clay Shaw of.the CIA” datalined Rome, 6 March
1967, written by'V, YERMAKOV. Tha articla chaxged that.
CXA made use of the services of Clay SHAW for-CIA's own
interests dn-Italy. The Pravda place notes that the DA
in New Orleans is accusing SHAW. of participation in the
assaseination conspiracy. It says SHAW spent "some years”
in Roma ag a forld Trade Canter leader. It claims that
the Canter was ‘a cover-for finanaing anti-Communist activity.
CIA gave directives to SHAW. The World Trada Canter was
a@ branch of “Permidax" (aic), "which the newspapers in
Switeerland openly accused of ‘criminal operations’...."
(Commants .It appears that all of the Pravda charges ara
untrue, axcept: that there was a CIA-SHAW relationship. 60
far ag is known, SHAW was naver agked to use his ralation-
ship with the World Trada Center for alandestine purposes
and, in fact, ha has riot bean in Italy.)

5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations tn and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulatés and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and;December 1, 1963. ‘dan we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that tine?

6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in’ the immediate wake of thé assassination (the fist month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How ¢an we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production thatavas
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the déstruction?

7, Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963), What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should.a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?

allocation/ distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?

MEMORANDUM

TO: John Pereira and Barry Harrelson

FROM: Jeremy Gunn.

SUBJECT: ARRB Questions Submitted for DO Briefing

T would like to address some of the concerns that you expressed at our meeting
yesterday, where wé briefly discussed the Review Board’s Proposed Questions for the
March 17 bilefing regarding DO records. We understand that you have some concerns
about the scope of the topics raised. We very much appreciate your recognition of the
importance that we attach to the ARRB’s independence and we again wish to
emphasize the fact that we fully understand your proper concem for the protection of
information that is unrelated to the Kennedy assassination.

Lwould like to emphasize that the questions that we sent to you were not intended as in
depth research queries, but rather as topical talking points for discussion. We prepared
the qiiestions, at your requést, in order to give the persons coriducting the briefing an
understanding of the typed of issues in which we were interested. They represent issues
that we wish to explote'in out quest for additional information and records-to facilitate
the completion.of the ‘ARRB's responsibilities under the JFK Act.

We appreciate your acknowledgment that the ARRB is not necessarily obligated to
justify to CIA the questions it deers relevant to the assassination. Nevertheless, in
order to facilitate and coordinate our efforts, we are very willing to offer the following
additional explication of those questions that we understand may have been considered
byt thé Agency to be excessively broad.

Question #5:
We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and.on the
Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1 and
December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

Until very recently, we had seen no evidence that CIA had microphone surveillance of
the Cuban compound, However, Dispatch HMMW 12454 (no IDEN number attached)
found in Box 23, Folder 9 of the Sequestered Collection, makes reference to LICOOLs
(concealed microphones inside the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City). Though the
dispatch reports that the last LICOOL ceased functioning in 1961--before the period in
question~the prior existence of this capability and the fact that the dispatchdiscusses
the possibility of reactivation prompts the question of whether all technical and’ <
surveillance operations against the Cuban and Soviet Consulates have been identified
to the ARRB. In addition, the dispatch refers to MKTRAP, a telephone hot mike
operation which was re-actuated from a basehouse in November 1963. The specific hot
mike telephone’ appears to have been in operation during 1963. Are there
records from this operation? Are there any other operations that may have picked up
Oswald’s visit?

Question # 6:
How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald’s visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequeatered Collection represents all records of technical production that were available
at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production still exists,
where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to retrieve any
additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records exist of the
destruction?

This question is a follow up to question #5, If MKTRAP was in operation from
September 1-December 1, 1963, where are the records or transcripts describing the take?
Was the take ever retained or reviewed? Do any original tapes or transcripts still exist?
Where might these records be found? Were any other technical operations in progress?
The various project files for the technical operations known to exist during this period
are spotty and incomplete. How can the ARRB know if it has reviewed records of all
the technical operation take for the relevant time period?

Question # 9:
Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing '
companies during the 1960's. How could a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?

The two 1967 Ramparts articles mention connections between the Agency and
journalists worldwide. The primary focus of this question is on any connection between
the Agency and any journalist who might have covered the assassination domestically.
Additionally, we would be interested in any publishing company involved in *
publishing books about the assassination. HSCA staff notes (RIF 180-10142-10087)
summarize several files dealing with contacts between the Agency, pub! houses,
and authors, For le, the file identified as QKOPERA/Liaison ZRB! outlines
/PROP on the status of negotiations between’

van Djilas. ZRBLESS is identified as a sul ject of
WUBONBON. Further, the staff notes mention a project involving| and
publication" [sic], a separate project involving "the Freedom Fund and distribution"

sic}, and.a third project to provide news service to the foreign press through
Bach of these projects appears to have been in operation in 1963-64.

Question # 10:
Did the Agency have any relationship, projects or contacts with publishing houses .
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency hada
relationship with any of the saine publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?

This question is a follow up to question #9. One record that is already in the collection
(RIF 180-10142-10087) summarizes the Project File of WUPUNDIT and notes two ‘one
time only’ operations in 1963-WURAISIN end WUTRANSIT which were responsible
for publishing two books each. In addition, WUSENDER is reported to be a ‘one time
only’ operation responsible for three books in 1964. If these books have domestic
implications or are on subjects related to the assassination, they would be relevant
documents.

We hope that this additional explication may help you and the DO understand our
approach to the issues raised in our questions. Should any of our requests impose on
you or your staff a burden that we may not have anticipated ~-or which would entail
work of dubious value or benefit - please advise us so that we can work with you to
modify or amend the requests accordingly.
