We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CTA aia produce one very significant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD made from someplace
dn Mexico City to the Soviet Mabassy there, using his own name. Speaking
broken Russian end using his true noe, COWALD was talkiny to the Bubassy
= OBYEDKOY, who often answers the phona. OSWALD said he bad visited

the Enbassy the previous Saturday (25 ceptenbar 1963) ona spoken to o

consul whose name he hea forgotten, and who baa promised to send a tele-

graa for him to Washington. He wanted to know if there vere “anything
nev." The guard said if the consul was derk it was (Valeriy Vladirovich)
KOS'TIXOY. fhe guard checked with comeone else ani said that the message
a out but no answer had been received. He then hung up.

This piece of information was produced from a telephone tap center

center produces great

masees of telephone intercepts which ore transeribed and reviewed by our
soall staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone conversa-
tion sf 1 Cetober had been transcribed and a summary of it cabled to
Vasaington. psc nee special to our Mexico
City Station, but in their report they did judge him to be on American
male.

The cabled report was received in Yashington on 9 October and checked

in our files, where it was iimediately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning

the Soviet Enbassy in Hexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD who bed

éefected to the Soviet Union in 1959 and retumea to the USA in 1962. on
10 October 1963, the day after the report frou Mexico City, CIA Uadguarters
sent out a cabled report about Lee OSWALD's phone call to the Soviet
Enbassy3 the report went to the FSI, the Departuent Ee State (because
OSWALD was a US citizen}, and to the Havy Departwent (because he was a

former Marine.) The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the

SEGEET



14-00000

LikLiheod that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of this same cable was delivered by hand to the Inmisration and
Naturalization Service, with which we have no cable link, ‘The see day

group of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for nore inforsation. Our Station

vestigation has confirmed all the details of his trip, where he stayed,
end vhat he did. To avola crossing lines with the FBI, om Mexico Station

A particularly sinister aspect of come aeslings vith the Soviets

Yolerty Vladimirovich KOSTIKOY, In his 1 October phone call to the
Soviet Embassy, the guard OBYSDXOY suggests that the Consul CSWALD ha

rejected the note.
