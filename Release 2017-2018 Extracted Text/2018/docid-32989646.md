SUBJECT: LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

Mean

My memorandum of 9/14/67 set forth for the Director's

information data concerning antipoverty workers' involvement in

racial disturbances for his possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference mentioned above.

The following additional information received from the

Dallas Office today is being submitted for the Director's

consideration in connection with this luncheon.

In response to a request from Mr. Randolf Ratliff,

Director of the Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty in

Dallas, Texas, a representative of this Bureau explained the

FBI's jurisdiction in racial matters to members of Ratliff's

staff, who work in the poverty areas in Dallas County Texas, on''!

9/6/67. The Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty is funded

by the Office of Economic Opportunity.

UNRECORDED COFT FILLI

On 9/13/67 one of Ratliff's staff workers confidentially

advised that after our representative had left the above meeting,

Ratliff instructed his staff members to give the FBI no informa-

tion and said that the FBI'is the white man's police and they

want nothing but "stool pigeons."

This individual further

alleged that all of Ratliff's 44 staff members were hand-picked

by Ratliff and that most of them are racial agitators. He

charged that Ratliff and most of the staff members are working

¡at creating racial incidents in order to stiz up local Negro

62-19856.

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

RE:

LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

communities. He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving

force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County

and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and

antipolice. He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying

to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional

antipoverty funds.

The source of the above information also alleged

that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of

the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-

old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in

the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the

arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity

learned of his activity and told him to desist.' He stated that

in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic),

staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were

in possession of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot.

He claimed that Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming

the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov

cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in

preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action.

Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb

an

"Uncle Tom."

The above information is being made available to

Mrs. Stegall at the White House, Mr. Shrivet of the Office of

Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated

9/18/67.

ACTION:

Submitted for the Director's possible use.

when asked about their leolings toward

that organization should have initiated the

"Jesse Jackson spoke ut our convention

Hamoton said.

I reads as follows:

"Thirty-nine years ago, the Melrose Park

of black residents to build a church within

Last Tuesday, Proviso aroa blacks met in

'When genocide can be

there is some question as to the sanity of a

system that would allow this,' he said.

GRAHAM, calmly but angrily, called the

elementary schools in dist. 89

'a network of

He also cited poor housing for low and

"We want an immediate end to police brutality and

murder of black people."

The second ammendment of the consitution gives us a

STOP FASCISI

Fascism is the pover of finance capital Itself-- the greedy

businessman, the demagogic politiciant one who loads the people

by appealing to prejudices and passions), and the rucist dog cop.

Each of which carcies out the oppression and exploitation of the

working class people in the guise of acmocracy.

The BLACK PANINER PARTY, THE VANGUARD PARTY, finds it our

duty to educate the poor and oppressca people to the form that

this capitalistic, racist system is taking- FASCISM. COld

blooded fascism is exemplified in the assaination of Malcolm X,

the imprisonment of Huey P. Newton for his political beleifs,

the assultasion of Martin Luther King, the occupation of

Hilmington, Delaware for one year after the death of king, the

24,000 throops at the Chicago Democratic Convention, the necessity.

• For the exile of Eldrigãe Cleaver, the national repression of the

Black Panther Party, the attack on the Republic of New Africa"s

•Convention, the brutal attack on the people of Berkley by 7,000

national guardsmen, and the representatives of all progrossive

elements that are struggling to wrest the power out of the hands

of the oppressor and return it to the people.

We, the masses of the people, must unite around this conuno.

enemy of fascism toregain the power of the people. We,

as a people,

have been stripped of our power as a rasult of copression and ex-

ploitation. Before we can regain that power and begin to control

our own destinies this system must suffer a revolutionary change .

Ess che good of all the people.

" Power cocedes nothing without demand". Without our domand

to neutralize of surpiess the power of this system, we will in turn

suffer defeat under fascism and lose our move for liberation to return

the pover to the people.

Feed Only a Few Children

The Black Panther party's program to

feed breakfast to school children is almost non-

yesterday.

Altho Fred Hampton, the party's Illinois

chairman, claims that 3,000 to 3,500 children are being

fed at three locations

each week, it was found that

on some days the centers were never opened and

on others only a handful of children showed up.

been closely watching the

activities, have also discovered that

the Panthers continue

to solicit food, milk, and

cash donations for the program from merchants and

other business men thruout the city.

One merchant, who regularly donates

large amounts of food for the program, recently told

investigators that when he visited

one of the centers,

the few children present were being read excerpts from

what he said was the communist Manifesto before the

breakfast was served.

At the Jackson boulevard, church the

the church has been

opened

for the free bruakfasts

only sporadically during the last month.

At 1512 S. Pulaski, there were no signs

of any feeding program

in progress. A teen-age

youth sweeping the stairway said that "they haven't

been

feeding

kids here for several weeks."

He said

he had heard reports that the program would be

starting again soon.

Yesterday, 22 children of grade school

age were counted going

into the Trinity church

for breakfast. On other occasions, investigators

noted children leaving the building with

half-eaten sandwiches and then throwing them in a

wastebasket on the sidewalk.

Since the program was

a high of 45 children (and on some

On October 10, 1959, at about 11:00 a.m.,

CHARLENE MITCHELL, Field Secretary, National Black

Liberation Commission (NBLC), CP, USA, in company with

two leaders of the Illinois Communist

Party (CP),

met with several members of the BPP including

FRED HAMPTON, Deputy Chairman, Illinois BPP, at

of exchanging ideas in the struggle

for black

liberation as well as finalizing plans for

MITCHELL to be the main speaker at the "End the

Illinois, which affair is being sponsored by the African-

American

Heritage Association (AAHA) (a characterization

of which is contained hereinafter). HAMPTON is also

to be one of the speakers at the above mentioned

rally.

General discussion at BPP Headquarters

a concurrent theory toward the anti-riot law

in that

neither want to become

FRED HAMPTON stated that the demonstrations

by the BPP at the Federal Building in Chicago during

the trial are for the purpose of tolling the facts

to the people.

the National Interim Committee (NIC) of the

SDS and current leader of the Rovolutionary Youth

Movement II (RYM II) faction of SDS, but that the

current leadership of SDS, called the Weatherman

faction, are a "bunch of damn fools".

HAMPTON claimed that the BPP is the

vanguard in this country whereupon CHARLENE MITCHELL

questioned this statement stating that actually

the vanguard are those who work on the basis of a

marxist-Leninist outlook.

Further discussion brought out that

preparations are being made by the BPP to circulate

petitions for community control of the local police

departments and that a survey indicates that

the

people in the ghetto are very enthusiastic over

this idea.

Concerning the establishment of a National

Defense Organization, CHARLENE MITCHELL stated that

prospects are good for calling a national conference

of such an organization where

possibly branches of

the organization can be established in the major

cities in this country. In this connection, MITCHELL

spoke of ANGELA DAVIS, & California CP professor at

the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)

where attempts had been made to dismiss her, but

that people rallied to her support and that such

broad defense support should also be established

HAMPTON felt that the BPP program should

appeal to the masses, including such projects as

breakfasts for school

schildren and work toward the

establishment of health centers since the communities

cannot absorb large quantities of ideology, but must

be assisted where personal

needs exist.

Another conclusion of this meeting is that

the CP and BPP are not "sticking their necks out for

anybody"', particularly in connection with the antiriot

trial in Chicago.

On October 12, 1969, an "End the War Now"

Rally, sponsored by the AAHA was held

at the you

Louis Theater, 35th and State Streets, Chicago,

Illinois.

Approximately 225 people attended. CP

and non-CP people were in attendance.

CHARLENE MITCHELL introduced FRED HAMPTON

as one of the speakers.

HAMPTON stated that the government has

no right to have BOBBY SEALE in jail or to try

The BPP is serving the people in the community

by feeding school children and soon plans to complete

a medical center.

HAMPTON stated that the Chicago Police

Department has raided the Illinois BPP Headquarters

in Chicago so often that now it is almost becoming

a museum. People want to see how the building has

been shot up.

The BPP, however, will continue to

grow since they are the vanguard.

HAMPTON stated that we must stop the war

in Vietnam. Women and children are being killed in

Vietnam while here the "pigs" are doing the same thing.

CHARLENE MITCHELL, the main speaker, first

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PIRTY

According to its official newspiper. the Black Pinther

Party (BPP) nas started during Decembor,

10bo, in Orkland

Calliornia, to organize black people so thuy can take control

of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE StAkE, BPP Chuerman, and HUEY

P. NEWTON, BPP Minister o1 Defense. NEWTUN is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black

people.

Residents of the black community are urged to arm

themselves against the police who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere: Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black Power.

Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an iticle appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of

"The Black Panther" is the

statement,

.....we will not dissent from American covernment.

He will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Ise-tung

of the

People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

• The nattonal beadquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue,

Berkeley, Calliornta.

Branches

have

been

established at various locations throughout the til'd States.

call the theory and no matter how hard it may seem,

it stays off those tracks. All we have to do is in

any given situation is to move from a basic ideology

that a revolution is an applied to use art and if we

are going to work so are going to work in that direction.

He have to understand that we have to move politically

TEACHING OF

REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAM

advised on November 14, 1969,

ne attended a political orientation class at the

Precious Blood Church, Hestern and Congress

Streets, Chicago, on October 29, 1969. About

30 individuals were in attendance.

The major discussion centered on

arguments to counter the classic racist

doctrine that all whites are evil by nature

and cannot be saved except by extermination.

The counter argument was that a multiplicity

of reasons are responsible for the white race's

technological advantage over the non-white race,

but the white man's system of economics makes

him the monster he 1s.

It was also argued that

capitalism and imperialism by their very nature

causes the white man to act as he does.

The

race or color of his skin has nothing to do with

his actions.

the leader of the above class.

JAKE HINTERS, a brother, a much beloved brother, a revolutionary,

a Black Panther made of red-hot niager steel, and the baddest

son of slaves that eyer came from the womb of woman. I have

said these thinas about JAKE WINTERs, because they are already

a fact. It's objective reality, proven by words and actions

in defending the Black community.

On November 13, 1969, JAKE WINTERS stood face to face and toe to

toe; his shotgun in his hand, with pia Daley's murderous task

force. He defined political

power by blowing away racist

It is also a proven fact and reality that Dalou's task force makes

daily and weakly raids on the Black community. They murdered

Tittle John Soto, 16 years old.

They murdered Michael Soto,

20 years old, and shot wildly and unconcerned through every

window in one of the buildinas in the Henry Honer project, injurina

scores of children. They murdered Jimmy Tucker and untold others.

JAKE WINTERS understood that the only way, to stoo fascist dig

forces from invading and slaughtering Black people and people period

and that is by defendina yourself with arms in hand! He didn't

talk about Black Cabitalism for surviving nor did he talk about

teachina

"Pork Chop"

culture Nationalism for surviving like Ron

Karenga's US organization in L.A. JAKE WINTERS was 18 vears old

and he made a far greater commitment than most men will ever

make in their entire life time.

This brother was an honor

student, a graduate of Engleworth High School who turned down

five scholarshios to work for the people.

He helped

as much as

he possibly could at the free Breakfast for Children Centers,

• plus he worked 7 days a week at the Post Office to brina in

money to keep the Canters operatina.

JAKE WINTERS is the highest dersonification of Huey P. Newton

and Malcolm X. The spirie of these revolutionaries is

manifested in each member of the Black Panther Party and we

will always remember JAKE WINTERS. Because of JAKE WINTERS

we will intensily the struggle; because of JAKE WINTERS we will

continue serving the poor oppressed beople - the proletariat.

The pigs, with

The result of

the raid: Fred Hampton and Mark Clark dead, four others

critically wounded, and three others arrested and charged

with attempted murder for defending themselves.

Chairman Fred was shot 7 times, Ronald "Doc" Sachel, Minister of Health and in charge of the

Free Medical Clinic, is in critical condition, shot 5 times. Deboral Johnson, an & 1/2-month

pregnant sister, is in jail. The pigs won't let the lawyers see her or any of the other

political prisoners.

This is the second attack on a Panther apartment in 3 days. On December 2, 80 pigs attacked

and brutally beat 3 Panthers including another expectant mother, Lynn French.

Tony Harris

The members of the Black Panther Parly were right in defending themselves. Jake Winters' re-

volutionary actions were just and necessary.

Any people whose constitutional rights are

STUDENTS FOR A DENOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the students for a

Democratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into

being at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan,

in June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of

"participatory democracy," the current line of the national

leadership raveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninisn.

MICHAEL KLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called

for the building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.

progIan of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights

struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position and finally to

Its present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which

leading the world-wide struggles against United States imperial-

ism.

On the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as

an imperialist power and does not support the polices of

that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608

Hest Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official

paper

"New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership

and

program adopted at meetings of the National Council and

National Interim Committee (NIC) .

Three national officers

and a NIC of eleven members are elected each year during a

June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college

• chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein

program and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter

1s autonomous in nature and is free to

carry out independent

policy and programs reflective uf

local conditions.

con, is an animal who will not attack. If attacked, the black nanther

backs un until he has no more room to

the

where nothinn else is possible but to atrack its assailants

- in order

to live.

This princinle of armed self-defense which is basic to the

Black Panther Party, will be exnlained in a document below.

The Black panther party..

while students at Merritt College in Oakland, set out ordainally to le-

They carried weapons as nrovided by law and

The result

of this surveillance was a decrease in brutality against members of th:

black community and increased harrassment of the Black Panther Party

• by the police.

The

leaders of the Black Panther Party (originally called the Black

Panther Party for Self Defense) soon realized that the police did not

make the ultimate decisions as

to whom they attacked and why. The no-

POLITICS AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY

The Black Panther Party program and platform is a result of the an

alysis that the Party,

esnecially its leader, Huey Newton, has made

of the nature of politico in America.

The way to political chande

through nower. This is the nature

of the black nower movement exemplified by Stokeley Carmichael in that

term.

What does this meadn?

Huev Newton has said that politics is

war without bloodshed and that war is an extension of solitics with

bloodshed.

The reason that the Reconstruction attemnt to nut blacks

office from the South

failed was because the black legislators,

intelligent, well-educated men, had no mowerful constituency behind

them. If you represent

a powerless

Troun in the legislature, then you

wield no nower. What is a nowerfui aroun?

Accordina to Minister oT

Defense, Newton, a noverful groun is one which, if it doesn't det

what it wants, can deliver a consequence. There are several ways in

which this kind of power is obtained. One way is to own the land.

This is feudal nower.

It is exercised by farmers who, when they do

not get what they want, can let the crops rot in the field. This is

the kind of consequence that rates attention and action.

Yhe second

way of gaining

power is economic:

ownershin of the businesses.

America the slaves were freed with the promise, by the Freedmen's

Bureau, of forty acres and two mules.

Had this nromise been fulfilled,

the black man would have had land nower and the ability to inflict a

a consequence.

promise, of course, was never fulfilled:

Mhat about businesses?

The businesses in the black

community are

owned by the white man.

Thus, even the economic boycott is difficult

because there are not sufficient black-owned businesses

to serve as

and alternative center for purchasing basic needed goods.

To ask the blacks

to redress their grievances by running for

office does not pose a

realistic solution. It is true that members

of the Black Panther

Party - Huey Newton

for Congress in the 7th

Congressional

District - Bobby Seale for Assembly in the 17th As-

sembly District in Alameda County - and Kathleen LCleaver for As

sembly in th 18th Assembly District in San Francisco - are running

for office on the peace and Freedom Party tickee, but this is only.

to have a forum to articulate the grievances of the black community.

Why? Because as stated above the black nolitician without a power-

ful constituency just warms a chair in the leoislature.

If the black community cannot rain economic or land-nower, now

can

they hone to have channes of their conditions?

Minister of

Defense Huey Merton says that the only other source of nower left is

that of the ability to inflict destruction as

a consequence. , thus,

the black people must arm in a political fashion. The black people

must be

able to deal with the occunation solice

forces in their

communities when they are attacked.

The alternative is to have the

police chosen by the black community, live in

the black community,

and serve the needs of the black community as that community sees

them,

This would mean that the nolice would no longer act merely to

defend the interests of the white businessman

and suumlord.

However, the blacks do not limit themselves to discussion of nower

below for the program.

WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE BLACK MAN IN AMERICA TODAY?

Eldridge Cleaver, Black. Panther, Minister of Infurmation has

stated

that the black man is a colonial subject and that black America is a

colony within white America.

The fact that the colonial subjeats are

dispersed throughout the country does not make their colonial sub

jugation any the

less real: Cleaver has stated that:

in North America have

always been nlagues by a dual status. le were

boin slave and christian, we were both free and segregated, we are

integrated and colonized. In the nast this duality has

to our disadvantage.

It kept us running

we propose to turn

it to our advantage,

in the manner that

turned our

blackness from a disadvantage into a rallying noint of

advantage."

Newton

has said that the black man in America today is a

man of confusion. He is of the loger socio-economic background. He

has withdrawn from his hostile enviroment which he daily faces and

denies his own ability. He has been taught that he is

inferior and

he blames

himself. He tries to change this image through

his style

of life - his

desire for flashy material

nossessions.

is asked

to resnect a law which does not resnect him. Those

who believe in

cultural nationalism try to answer his noblem by turning him back

to the time of the eleventh century

in Africa.

However, his

free-

dom cannot come from such an identification.

His freedom will come

from

identifying

with the revolutionary

struggles. of neonle of color

all over the world, including Africa today.

The black man, accord-

ing to cleaver, has a common

culture and

a common history. All the

lacks to be a nation is land.

Hhat is the History of the Black Man in America?

The history of the present attitude of the whites

toward blacks

in this country has deep psychological roots, according to Nauton.

It dates to the time, hundreds of years

ano, when the white Euroneans

first came

into contact with black

Africans.

It relates

te cultural

differences.

The Euroneans who came to ifrica worshinoad one god

a god who was all-good.

This was his absolutism.

Man was said to

have been created in the image of the all-nood god and therefore could

do no evil.

Man's

instinctual sexual drives were deemed ungod-like

and were repressed. Such

evil was deemed to come from cutside man-

the resuit of demons, deyils, and witches - who were burred at the

stake.

the other hand, the Africans below the Sahara, mostly black,

had a differant form of worshin.

Their nod was both

good and bad.

They believed in dualisn. Their nod had two or more heads - one good

and one

bad.

The African had to avoid being like the had head and

must net into the bavor of the good head.

However, he did not deny

sarg of his being as comino irom outside

himself.

Thus, his sexual

lives were nart of hin - not evil demons fron

the outside.

When the Euroneans caine

to Africa they enslaved the blacks south

of the Sahara who believed in

dualisn.

They were told by the church

that the "good" Africans north of the

sahara, unn believed in a single

10d, were more in line with the Euronean belief and should

not be

enslaved.

As james Baldwin said,

To be black and conscious in America is

The whites cannot know what

it is like to live

as

a black man

in America - in white society. What

we can know is the nature of the conditions that must be changed to

give the black man his long overdue human rinhts.

WHY FREE HUEY NEWTON?

1. The Political Reasons.

Huey P. Newton is a nolitical prisoner.

He is in jail today, accused of killing an Dakland noliceman, not

because he committed this crime, which he did not, but because he is

the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Party. Since the incep..

tion of

the Party the oaklard police have tried to harrass

it out

of existence. As the party became stronger,

the nolice tactics became

more vicious. The police have long had the

license numbers and des-

criptions of

all the cars driven by members of the Black Panther Party.

On the night of October 28, 1967, Police Officer Frey stinned

an automobile which he knew to be a car on the list of those driven

by. Black Panthers. He stopned the car for an alleged traffic violation,:

the nature of nich nas never been discloes.

In his tastimony before

the Grand Jury, Officer Heanes, the nolice

officer who was. summoned

Frey to come to his assistance after he stonned the Panther car,

said that newton DID NOT HAVE A GUN. Attorney Charles harry has in-

dicated that the evidence noints to

tha

real

nossibility that both

officers fired at each other and the officer Heanes' bullets

killed

Officer Frey.

nolice have always,

in the black community, claimed the right

to exercise indiscriminate viôlence.

It was for this reason that

the Black Panther Party was priginally formed.

Before October 28th

the Oakland police

had harrassed Newton on numerous occasions

and

had threatened his life. On October 28 Newton was arrested and shot

in the

stomach because he stood for change in the black

community.

The blark community knows that Huey lawton and the Panthers

have

raised a crucáal issue - control of black communities by black

neople.

They

recognize that it is

the nolice

who

nernetrate violence

on a daily basis in order io maintain

their illegitimate control over

НН 55176 DooId:32989646 Page 300

## Page 301

black' ghettoes. They racognize that the actions of the Panthers con-

stitute legitimate sel

defense anainst apolice

ce more interested

in political repression and "reaning the niggers in their nace"

than

in cacching criminals. And

they recognize the indictment of Huey

Newton as an attempt

not only to mine nut an heroic black resistance

leacer, but to also

intimidate and

crush the movement for self-

determination for all black neonio.

If black nolitical leaders

not actually assassinated,. as were Mednar Evers, Malcoim X, Marcin

Luther Kind - then

the covernment finds ways of confining and neut

tralizina them as in the cases of H.Ran Brown and Lakoi Jones. That

is why the black community stands behind the concent FREE HUEY. They

mean that Huey Newton was

harrassed and threatened and finally shot

because he is a nolitical leader: that he was

arrested and thrown

in jail

because he is

a nolitical leader, that he

faces the gas chamber

because he is a nolitical leader.

These are imnortant noints for the

white as well

as the black community.

The same tyne of harrassment

has taken nace against whites who have

onnosed this

goveronent:

the

case of the Oakland 7 arrested on conspiracy to commit à misdemeanor:

a felony. It has happened to those who very neacefully tried to pro-.

test the policies renresented by Dean Rusk, when he anneared at ehe

Fairmount Hotel - demonstrators who were kicked, beaten and MACED by

the S. F. police while they were RUNNING AWAY = trying

to follow orders

to disperse. The list could go on endlessly.

Protest the goverrment-

and risk your physical safety - that is the message to whites and

blacks alike.

11. The Legal Reasons. Huey Newton was indicted by the Alameda

County Grand Jury - a jury

He went to woodrow

then attended Oakland Technical High.

His childhood was the same as

that of most black youths.

He was

never given the cnportunity to

do skilled wor but worked very

dilinently as a seasonal cannery worker from his araduation from high

school onward.

Huey

Newton learned to read well at the ane of 16.

This was

when his high school

counselors told him he was not college material..

He set out to show them that no white man could tell him what he was

canable of doing.

Huey went to

Oakland City College and not an AA degree with an

excellent gradenoint average.

He spent one and one-half years

san Francisco Law

School. He left law school to ornanize full-time

for black liberation.

While Huey and

of the Black Panther Party,

were at Merritt College they formed the Black Panther Party for

They felt that the Panther nro

gram had to be imnlemented practically. This meant starting with

Point No. T of the Black Panther Party program to work toward

immediade end to nolice brutality and murder of black neonle."

Shortly thereafter young Bobby Mutton inquired about what Bobby

and Huey were doing.

They exnlained the iren of the Black Panther

Party and its operations to Bobby Hutton, who

then became the first

black youth to join the Party.

He was anointed Party Treasurer.

He served the black community

faithfully until his murder at the hands

of the pakland nolice on Anril 6, 1968.

community have a qun to defend himself.

and using their weapons other than to defend their own lives.

The police forces in the black community are comnosed of men who

red in this country since

Watts.

The nosition of the Black Panther Party was aranhically il-

lustrated when after Martin Luther

Kina's assassination, Bobby Seale,

chairman of the Party, went around nakland in a sound truck urging

black neonle to stay home and not become involved in violence.

Not because there was no reason

for reunit, but bacause the Black

Panthers know that such spontanenus rebellion results in death for

black neonle and no channes in their conditions of life.

such vio-

lence is snoradic, short-lived, and

costly.

However, it is also very

clear that non-violent tactics

have rasulted in no channe either.

no Tacti

before his

death, Martin Luther King indicated

that the poor

March on Washinaton was his FINAL attemne to use non-violent

tactics to get what his neonle have been deined for 400 ycars. after

that, Dr. King indicated, all he could see was fascism. And he

could not urne neonle to

remain non-violent in the face of that.

why do the Panthers teleove the Black community will be Annihilated?

The white community is prenared for menocide.

Whites all over

this nation are arming themselves to nrotect their community from an -

invasion of blacks.

This is so even thourh not one white community

has yet

been invaded or even threatened with such invasion. This is

true even though whites claim that

if there were an invasion of

blacks they would be beaten almost

immediately. Why are they armed?

Fear that stems from a lack of understandina of the watts

cidents, fear that stems from a lack of understanding of what it is

like to

be black in this

country.

Fear of militancy aà traxaxaskay

Thaydaxatshansexxhaxaix that asks for channe NoW. In nart the

fear comes because the whites know that they themselves are nower

in get change that would annease the militancy of the blacks.

They have no more control over their rovernment than do black neople.

They do not choose who will run for office - that is a back-room

nolitical decision. They

knoy that when they vote for a candidate

they must rely. not

on knowledne of his nosition, but on faith that

he will novern well. So when they are afraid they do not rely on

their novernment - they buy nuns.

Not only

the white man

individual is armed. Police de-

narements all over this nation are

stocknilling weanons which, in

their horror,

are matched by those used by the army in Vietnam. Why

the stocknile? For the

second Civil war.

This is the way Esquire

Magazine say it in their March 1968 issue, in an article of that title

THE SACRAMENTO INCIDENT

Because the Black panther Party has exercised its constitutional

rinht to bear arms, Assembluman Mufford decided that this riaht

would have to be curbed.

He introduced a bill "rohibitina instruc-

cion in the use of firearms for the nurnose of riotinn, and rohibit-

ins the carryinn of loaded firearms on nublic streets and in nublic.

nlaces by all excent neace officers, muards, and members of the armed

forces." (S. F. Chronicle Story, 5/3/57) .

As most nechle know the

amendment to the United States Constitution says that

"A well

reaulated militia, beino necessary to the security of a free State,

the rinht of the neonle to keen and bear arms shall not be infrinaed."

The nurnose of this amendment was to nrevent the very thing that

Mulford"s bill tries to set un:

the regulation of the reonle's right

to be free.

What is the nature of this richt? Huey Newton stated it

very clearly when he said that if the neonle are unarmed, and if the

sovernment has a resular nolice force and a milidary force, the reonle

are slaves to the novernment or are sublect to slavery at any time.

Newton's conclusion! so long as the molice are armed, the black neonle

should be armed. As Newton said: "Ninety mercent of the reason we

carried nuns in the first nace was educational. We set the examnle.

We made black neonle aware that they have the rinht to carry runs."

Who Go to sacramento with runs?

There is some history to the sacramento incident of which most

neonle are unaware.

in Maril 1, 1967, a vounn black man named benzil vogell, ared

22 years, was killed by a member of the contra Costa

Sheriff's de-

nartment. -Denzil Powell was

killed with his hanc's raised over his head.

His family. was denied the rinht

to shotogranh his body and the rinht

to have his clothes

returned to

them.

Denzil Dowell was unarmed.

Furthermore the sheriffs knew that he was sufferina from an unjured

hin which would prevent him from escanina from the scene of the crime.

WHY WAS HE KILLED?

As with the killinn of ranther Bobby llutton fsee

below there is no reason - other than that he was black.

On Anril 18, 1967,

the Black Patther renresentatives, bearino

Anril 19, 1967, renresentatives of the Black Panthers and some

interasted persons met with

the sheriff. He refused to allow the

Panthers to enter his office carrvin runs.

Because Panther leader

Huey Newton felt the conference was so important, he and the other

Panthers save un their rinnt

waar a nun

and removed the runs

before talkin to

the sheriff.. The sherift refused to remnve the

man who shot Devell mendinn the investination.

Further he refused

to instruct his men

instructed the Fanthers that if they wished channes made, the should

undersheriff

Pamsey went to the assembly and sooke in favor of the Mulford bill -

and in

doing so referred srecifically to the need for the bill to

deal

with the Black Panthers.

Tr

resnonse to this

conference and to the Hulford bill itseft,

Minister of Defense Huey Newton wrote a statement which Panther

Chairman Bobby Seale delivered on the stens of the canitol in sacra-

mento on May 2, 1967.

The statement is

as follows:

They went to the ssemble observation section led by a

the nolice arrested 23 of them

for violation of the Fish and LGame code. The fanthers did not resist

arrest, even though they were armed and were numerous: After being

arrested,

the Panthers were thrown into the drunk tank of the jail

with neither beds

nor blankets.

They were treated just like the

animals for the killing of which reculations were made in the Fish

As Huey

to distort what hannened

THE MURDER OF BOBBY-HUFFON-AND-THE-ARRESI-OF-FHE-PANFBER-8

On Sunday, Anril 7,

the Black Panther Party had planned a nicnic

barbecue to raise money

for the defense of Huey P. Newton. Saturday

night Eldridne Cleaver,

Bobby Hutton, and a number of other Panthers :

were driving around oakland to collect food that the sisters had

nrenared.

Their mission was interrunted when

sereral squad.cars of

Oakland solice intercented and ambushed the Panthers in their own

community.

Today, Eldride Claaver is behind bars, nossibly for life.

Bobby Hutton is dead - murdered by the bakland nins when he tried

dictments based on false information provided bu the nigs and

The following

jail:

FY THE F-PY'S SiTE OF

The Party School opens trday and I wish it every succoss.

I would like to say something about the prublem of cur Party's

Why must there be a revolutionary party? There must be a rev.

ationary party because the wirld contains enomies who oppress the

cople and the people want to throw off enemy oppression.

BIn the

ra of capitalism and imperinlism, just such a revolutionary party

s the Communist Party is needed,

Without such a party it is simply

mosssible for the poople to throw off enemy oppression.

We are

smmunists, we want to lead the people in overthrowing the enemy, rnd

o we must

keep our ranks in good order, we must march in step, ouc

roops must be picked troops and our weapons good weapons.

Ithout these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown.

What is the problem now facing our Party? The genera: ¿ine of ti

the Party is correct and presents no problem, and the Party's

work has been fruitful.

The Party has several hundred thousand

minbers who are leading the people in extremely hard and bitter

struggles against the eneny. This is plain to everybody and

beyond all doubt,

Then is there or is there not any problem still facing our

Party? I say there is and, in a certin sense, the problem is

quite serious,

ExWhat is the problem? It is the fact that there is some-

thing in the minds of a number of our comraies which strikes sne

not quite right, not trite proper.

In other words, there is still something wrong with our style

of study, with our style in the Party's internal and external

relations and with our style of writing. By something wrong with

the style of study we mean the malady of subjectivism. By some-

thing wrong with our style in Party relations we mean the malndy

of sectarianism,

By sonething wrong with the style of writing

wes mean the malady of stereotyped Party writing. All these are

wrong, they are ill winds,

but they are not like

the wintry noith

winds

that sweer across the whole sky. Subjectivism, sectarianism

and stereotyped Party writing are no longer the diminant styles,

but merely gusts of contrary wind, ill winds fros the air-rais

duce them. Our whole Party should undertake the job of senling

off these

passages, and so should the Party School, These three

ill winds, subjectivism, sectarianism and stereo-typed Party

writing,

have their historical crigins. Although no longer

dominant in the whole Party, they still constantly create trouble

and

assall us, Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to

study, analyse, and elucidate them,

right subjectivism in order to rectify the style of study,

fight sectarianism in order to rectify the style in Party rela

tions, and fight Party stereotypos in order to rectify the style

of writing--such is the task before us.

To accomplish

the task si overthrowing the enemy, we must

accomplish the task of rectifying these styles within the Party,

The style of study and the style of writing are also the Party's

style of work.

Once nur Party's style of work is put cmpletely

right, the people all ever the country will learn from our exam-

ple, and saoxias. Thee outside the Party who have the senie kind of

And the Communist Party si China has been the initiator, propagandist

iI.

However, we still have shortermings, and very big ones too. Unless we correct

nese shortcomings, we shall not, in my opinion, be able to take another step forwar.

n our work and in our great cause of integrating the universal truch of Marxism-

eninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.

First, take the study of currant conditions. We have achieved some success in

I study ui present donestic and intemational conditicns, but for such a large

Jlitical party as ours, the material we have collected is

fragnentary and our re-

earch work insystematic on each and every aspect of these subjects, whether it be

le political, military, econcmic or cultural aspect. Generally steaking, in the

ist twenty years, we have not done systematic and through work in collecting and

udying material

on these aspects, and we are lacking in a climate of investigation

nd study of objective reality.

To behave like "a blindfolded man couching sparrows:

= a "blind man groping for fish," to be crude and careless, to indulge in verbiage,

- rest content with a smattering of knowledge-such is the extremaly bad sugie of

ork that stilt exists among many comrades in our Party, a style uttorly opposed to

he fundamenta]. spirit of Marxism-Leninis.

Marx, Engels, Jenin and Stalin have

aught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously and in praceed

rom objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of sur comrades act

"n direct vistation of this truth.

Second, take the study of history. Although a few Party membors and sympathiz

is have undertaken this work, it has not been' done in an organized way. Many Party

embers are still. in a fog about Chinese history, whether of the last hundred years

sr of ancient times. There are many Marxist-Leninist schslars whe cannot open their

ouths without citing ancient Greece; but as for their own ancestors-sorry, they

inve been forgotten.

There is no climate of serious study either o current condi-

ions or of past history.

in order to explain this idea furthur, i sheulá lika to contrast tro opposite

¿ibitudes.

First, there is the subjestivist attitude, wiüh tiris attitude, a person does

not nike a systematic ard thorough study of the environment, but works by sheer sub

jertire enthusiasm and has a blurred picture of the face of China today. lith this

autitude, he chops up history, knows only ancient Greece but not China and is i a

fog aiout the China of yesterday and the day before yesterday. With this attitude

a person studies Marxist-leniiist theory in the abstract and without any aim. Ho

goes to Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin not to seek the stand, viewpoint and intica

with which to solve the theorstical and tactical problems of

the Chinese rivalition

but to study theory purely for theory's sake. He does not shoot the arrow at the

target but shoots at randon.

Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stälin have Faught us that we

should proceed from objective realities and that we shoüld derive laws from them to

serve as our guide to action. For this purpose. we should, as Mari has said, apoco-

priate the material in detail and subject it to scientific analysis and spnchesis.

Tany of our people do not act in this way but do the opposite. A good number of their

are doing research work but have no interest in studying either the China of today

o tho China of yesterday and confire their interest to the study of empty "theories"

divorced from reality. Many others are doing practical. work, but they too pay no

astention to the study of objective conditions, often rely on sheer enthusiasm and

substitute their personal feelings for policy. Bith kinds of people, relying on the

subjéctive, ignore the existance of objective realities. When making speeches. they

ifaulge in a long string of headings, A, B, C, D, 1, 2, 3, 4, and when writing arti-

slos, they turn out a lot of verbiage. They have no intention of seeking truth from

stance, brittle without solidity. They are always right, they are the Number One

anthority under Heaven, "imperial envoys' who rush everywhere. Such is the süyle of

work of some comrades in our ranks. To govern one's own conduct by this style is to.

hara cneself, to teach it to others is to harm others; and to use it to direct the

evolucion is to harm the revolution. To sum up, this subjectivist method which is

contrary to science and Marxism-leninism is a formidable enemy of the Communist

Partys the working class, the prople and the nation; it is a manifestation rf impur-

riy in Party spirit. A formidable enemy stands before us, and we must overthrow

hima. Only when subjectivism is overthron can the truth of Marxism-Leninism prevail.

can Party spirit be strengthang, can the revolution be victorious. We must assert

that the absence of a scientific attitude, that is, the absence of the Marxist

Leninist approach of uniting theory and practice, means that Party spirit is either

absent or deficient.

There is a couplet which portrays this type of person. It runs:

The reed growing on the wall--top-heavy, thir-stermed and shallow of root;

The bamooo shoot in the hills--sharp-tongued, thick-skinned and hollow

inside.

Is this not an apt description of those who do not have a scientific attitude, who

can only recite words and phrases from the works of larx, Engals, Lenin and Stalin

and who enjoy a reputation unwarrinted by suy real. laring?

If anyone" really

wishes to cure himself of this malady, I advise him to commit this .couplet to memory

or to show still more courage ind paste it on the wall uf his room.

larxi sn-lenin-

ism 1s a soience, and scierce means honest, solid knowledge; there is no rocm for

playing tricks.

Let us, then, ba honest.

Secondly, there is the Marxist-leninist actitude. With this attitude, a person

applies the theory and method oi Marxisn-Leninism to the systematic arit

thorough

investigation and study of the environment. He does not work by enthusiasm alone,

in the whold Party.

It is a question of the method of thinking

As such, it

are, for instance, muddled ideas about what is a theorist; what

is an intellectual and what is meant by linking theory and pric

tice.

Let us first ask, is the theoretical level of our Party high

or low? Recently more Marxist Lenist works have been translated

and more people have been reading them.

That is a very good

thing.

But can ve therefore a say that the theoretical level

of

cur Party has been greatly raised? True, the level is now some-

what higher than before,

But our theoretical front is very much

out of harmony with the rich content of the Chinese revolutionary

movement, and a comparison of the twi shows that the theoretical

side is lagging far behind. Generally speaking,

our theory can-

not as yet keep pace with our revolutionary practice, let alone

lead the way as it should.

We have not yet raised our rich and

varied practice to the proper theoretionl plane.

important ones--and raised them to a theoretical plane.

kind of theorists do y

want?

We want theorists

o can, in ac:

cordance with the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method,

correctly interpret the practical problems arising in the course

of history and revolution and give scientific explanations and

theoretical elucidations of China's economic, political, military,

cultural and other problems, Such are the theorists we

be a theorist of this kind,

a person must have a true grasy of

the essence of Marxism-Leninism, of the Marxist-Leninist stand,

viewpoint. and method and of the theories of Lenin and Stalin un

the colonial revolution and the Chinese revolution, and he must be

able to apply them in a penetrating and

scientific

analysis of

China's practical problems and discover the laws of deveiopment

of these problems,

Such are the theorists we really need.

The Central Committee of our Party has now made a decision

calling upon our comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist-

Leninist stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study of

Chinas history, and of China's economics, politics, military

affairs and culture, and to analyse every problem concretely on

the basis of detailed material

and then draw theoretical conclu

sions.

This is the responsiblity we must shoulder,

Our comrades in the Party School should not regard Marxist

theory as lifeless dogma,

It is necessary to master Marxist the-

ory and apply it, master

it for the sole purpose of applying it.

If you can apply

the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating

one or two practical problems, you shoule be commended and cre-

dited with some achievement.

The more problems you elucidate and

the more comprehensively and profuondly you do so, the greater

will be your achievement, Our Party School should also lay down

yhr taxx rule to grade students good or poor accoring

they look at China's problems after they have studied Marxism-

Leninism, according to whether or not they see the problems clear-

Iy and whether or not they see them at all.

Next let us talk about the question of

mother honor at.

to how

the "intellectuals".

Since China is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country and her cult-

ure is not well developed,

intellectuals are particularly treasured

On this question of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of

the. Party made the decision over two years ago that we should win

over the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they are

revolutionary and willing to take part in the resistance to Japan,

welcome them one and all.

It is entirely right for us to esteem

intellectuals, for without revolutionary intellectuals the revo

lution cannot

triumph, But we all know there are many intellec-

tuals tha as who fancy themselves very learned and

assure airs of

erudition without realizing that such airs are bad and harmfui

and hinder their own progress.

They ought to be aware of the

trugh that actually many so-called intellectuals are, relatively

speaking, most ignorant ands the workers and

peasants sometimes

know more than they do. Here some will say,

"Ha! You are turning

things upside down and talking nonsense."

sany comrades

don't get excited; there is some sense

in what I am saying.

What is Knowledge? Ever since class society came into being

The worla has known only two kinds of knowledge, knowleuge of the

struggle for production and knowledge of the class

struggle,

Natural science and social science are the crystalizations of

these two kinds of knowledge, and philosophy is the senaralization

and summation of the knowledge of nature and the knowtei.ge of

society. Is there. any

other kind of knowledge?

No. Now let us

that abe completely cut off from the practiral activities of

What about them?

A persor sues tirrugh a primary

through to a university of

learning,

But all he has is booklearning; he has not yet taken

to anv field of life.

Can such a porson be regarded asa coi:, :?i-

ely developed intellectual?

inraly so,

in my opinion, beca!:

his knowledge is still incomplete.

What then is relatively

complete knowledge?

All relatively complete knowledge is i: rinca

in two stages: The first stage is perceptual knowledge, the sec.nù

is rational knowledge, the latter being the develorient o= the

former to a higher level.

What sort of knowledge is thw students

booklearning?

Even supposing all their knowleage is truth: it

is still not knowledge acquired through thier own persuna. ix.-

perience,

but consists of theories set down by thier yrecr.ess.rs

in summarizing experience of the struggle for production and of

the class struggle.

It is entirely necessary that students

should acquire this kind of knowledge, but it must be understood

that as far as they are concerned such knowledge is in a senses

still one sided, something which has been verified by others but

not yet by themselves.

What is most important is to be good at

applying this knowledge in life

and in practice,

Therefore, I

advise those whe have only booklearning but as yet no contact •i

with reality, and also those with little practical experience, to

realize their own short comings and become a little more modest.

How can those who have only booklaerning be turned into intel-

lectuals in the true sense?

The only way is to get them to take

part in practical work and become practical workers, to get those

engaged in theoretical work to study important practical problems,

In this way our sax ain can be attained,

What I have said will probably make some people angry. They

will say,

"According to your

explanation, even marx would not be

regarded

as an intellectual." I say they are wrong.

Marx took

part in the practice of the revolutionary movement and als

created revolutionary theory,

Beginning with the commodity,

the

simplest element of capitalism, he made a thoroligh study of the

economic strücture of capitalist society, Millions of

peopic saw

and handled commodities every day but were so used to them that

they took no notice. Marx alone studied commodities scientifi-

cally.

He carried out a tremendous work of research into their

actual development and derived a nature, history and proletarian

revolution and created dialectical materialisn,

hostorical mater-

ialism and the theory of proletarian revolution. Thus Marx became

a most completely developed intellectual, representing the acme of

human wisdom; he was fundamentally different from those who have

only booh-learning,

Marx undertook detailed investigations and

studies in the course of practical struggles; formed generaliza-

tions and then verified his conclusions by testing them in prac-

tical struggles--this is what we call theoretical work,

Party needs a large number of comrades who will learn how to do

such work.

In our Party there are many comrades who can learn to

do this kind of theoretical rescarch, most of them are intelligent

and promising and we should value them.

But they must follow

correct principles and not repeat the mistake of the past.

They

must discara dogmatisin and not confine themselves to ready-made

to go astray. •

However, of the two kinds of

subjectivism, dognatism is still

the greater danger in our Party. For dogmatists can easily assune

Besides muddled ideas about the

and the "intellect

theory and practice"; a phrase they have on their lips every day.

They talk, constantly about

"linking", but actually they mean

parating"

, because they make no effort at linking.

How is t

Marxis'-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the

Chinese revolution?

To use a common expression, it is by "shoot-

ing the

arrow at the target".

As the arrow is to the target, so

is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution.

Some comrades,

however, are "shooting without a target"

shooting at random,

and

such people are liable to harm the revolution.

Ochers merely 5x

stroke the arrow fondly, exclaiming,

"What a

fine arrow! What a

fine arrow!," but never want to shoot it.

These people are only

connoisseurs of curios and have virtually nothing to do with the

revolution,

The arrow of

Marxism-Leninism must be used to

at the target of the Chinese revolution.

unless this point hoot

made clear, the theoretical level of our Party can never be raised

and the Chinese revoltuion can never be victorious.

Ona comrades must understand that we study Maxisn-Leninism

not for cisplay, nor because there is any mystery about it, but

solely because it is the science which leads the revolutionary

cause of the proletariat to victory,

Even now, there are not a

It is precisely such ignorant people

as a religious dogma,

To them we should

Stalin have repeatedly siated that our theory is not a dogna but

a guide to action.

But such people prefer to forget this Ex

only when they become good at applying the Marxist-Leninist stand,

RECTIFY THE

PARTY"S STYLE CH WORK

Fag: 7.

So much for today about combaüing subjectivism

in order to

rectliy the style of study throug hout the party.

Let me now speak about the question or sectarianism,

Having been steeled for twenty years, our Party is no longer

dominated by sectarianism, Remnants of

sectarianism, however,

are still found both in the Party's internal relations and in

its

external relations.

Sectarian tendencies in internal relations

lead to exclusiveness towards people outside the Party and hinder

inner-Party unity and solidarity,

while sectarian tendencies in

external relations lead to exclusiveness towards

people outside

the Party and hinder the Party in its task of uniting the whole

people, Only by uprooting this evil in both its aspects can

the Party advance unimpeded in its great task of achieving unity

What are the remnants of inner-Party sectarianism? They are

mainly as follows:

First, the assertion of "independence". Some comrades see only

the interests of the part and not the whole; they always put un-

due stress on that part of the work for which they themselves are

responsible and always wish to subordinate the interests of the

whole to the interests of their own part, They do not understand

the fartyes system of democratic centralism; they do not realize

that the Communist Party not only needs democracy but needs cen-

tralization even more,

They forget the system of democratic

centralism in which the minority is subordinate to the majority,

the lower level to the higher level, the part to the whole and

the entire membership to the Central Committee.

Chang Kuo-tao

asserted his "independence" of the Central Committee of the

Party and as a result "asserted" himself into betraying the Party

and became a Kuomintang agent. Although the sectarianism we are

now discussing is not of this extremely serious kind, it must

still be guarded against and we must do away completely with all

manifestations of disunity.

We should encourage comrades to

take the interests of the whole into account.

Every Party mem-

ber, every. branch of work, every statement and every action must

proceed from the interests of the whole Party, it is absolutely

impermissible to fiolate this principle.

Those who assert this kind of "independence" are usually wedded

to the doctrine of

"me

first" and are generally wrong on the ques

tion of the relationship between the individual and the Party, Al

though

in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice

they put themselves first and the Party second.

What are these

people after?

They are after fame and position and want to be in

whenever they are rut in charge of a branch of

work, they assert their "independence". With this aim, they draw

some people in, push others out and resort to boasting, flattery

and touting among the comrades, thus importing the vulgar style of

bourgeois political parties into the Communist Party.

It is

their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief. I believe

we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is

abslutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world.

Which

are the honest Beople?

Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin are honest,

men of science are honest, Which are the dishonest people?

sky, Bukharin, Chen Tu-hsiu and Chang Kuo-tao are extremely dis

honest; and those who assert "independence" out of personal or

sectional interest are dishonest too. All sly people, all those

who do not tave a scientificattitude in their work, fancy them-

In these hã sumed up, on the ideological plane, past differences in the

querading as farxist-leninism, were prevalent in the Party, and which chierly

¿lested themselves in subjectivist and sectarian tendencies, their fom of ex-

great debate between" proletarian and petty-bourgeois ideology inside and outside

Another problem is the relation between old and new cadres.

since the beginning of the war of Resistance, our Party has grown

enormously, and large numbers of new cadres

have emergeds that is

a very good thing, In his report to the Eighteenth Congress of the

Communist Party of the Soviet Union (B.) Comrade Stalin said,"

there are never enough old cudres: there are fax less than i

required, and they are partly goliid out of commission owing to the

operation of the laws of nature." Here he was discussing the cadres

situation and not only the laws of nature. If our Party does not

have a great many new cadres working in unity and co-operation with

the old cadres, our cause will come to a stop, All oid cadres, there

fore, should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthuslasm and

show

them the warmest solicitude, True, new cadres have their short

comings. They have not been long in the revolution and lack experl~

ence; and unazoidably some have brougt with then vestiges of the

unwholesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology

vi petty-bourgeouis individualism. But such shortconings can be

gradually eliminated

through education and tempering in the revo

Lutionk, The strong points of the new cadres, as Stalin said, 1s

that they are acutely sensitive to what is new and are therefore

enthusiastic and active to a high degree--the very qualities that

some of the old canres lack,, Cadres, new and old, should respect

Generally speaking: in places where the old cadres are mainly in

charge,

it is they

who should bear the chief responsibility if rele

tions with the new cadres are not good,

All the above relations between

the part and the whole, rela

this does not mean, however, athat all our comrades

In fact, sectarian tendencies

very sérious degrce,

Many of our comrades, tend to:Deroveaboring

This is indeed a sectarian tendency. After reading a few Marxist

at all and is simply the mischievous result of the sectariar ideas

" RECTIFY THE PARTY"S

LYLE OF WORK

jage 12

There is no time today to talk about the question of stereo-

typed Party writing: I shall discuss it at another meeting.. Ster-

eotyped Party writing is a vehicle for filth, a form of expression

for subjectivism and sectarianism.

It does people harm and damages

the revolution, and we must get rid of it. completely.

Io combat subjectivism we must propagate materialis and dia-

lectics!

However, there are many comrades in our Party who lay

no stress on the propaganda either of materialism or of dialectics

Some tolerate subjectivist propaganda and regard it with equanim-

They think they believe in Marxism, but make no effort to

propagate materialism and do not give it a thought or express any

opinion when they hear or read subjectivist stuff. This is not

the attitude of a Communist.

It allows many of our comrades to

be poisoned by subjectivist ideas: which numb their sensitivity.

Be should therefore launch a campäign of enlightenment withing

the Party to free the minds of our comrades from the fog of sub-

jectivism and dogmatism and should call upon them to buycott sub-

jectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing. Such evils

are like Japanese goods, for only our enemy wishes us to preserve

advocate a boycott against them, just as we boycott Japanese

goods.

We should boycott all the wares of subjectivism.

sectar-

ianiem, and stereotyped Party writing, make their sale difficult,

and not allow their purveyors to ply their trade by exploiting the

low theoretical level in the Party.

Our conrades must develop

a good nose for this purpose; they

should take a sniff at everthing

and disinguish the good from the bad before they decide whether

to welcome it or boycott it.

Communists must albays go into the

whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully

think over whether or not it corresponds to reality and is really

well founded; on no account should they follow blindly and encour

age slavishness.

Finally; in opposing subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped

Party writing we must have in mind two purposes: first, "learn

COMMUNITY CONTROL OF POLI

We who live in Chicago, state of Illinois, must face

an increasingly evident truth: we have no control over the

the survival of our freedoms, we must now demand control

of these forces, particularly that one which we confront

These racist police have baen used as forces working

against the sachle and in cahoots with the corrupt political

police, joined by the greedy businessmen like Hunt and

Dupont, are in control of our destinies. .It is become an

"AMERICAN TRADITION" for police to prevent the American neople

from protesting these intolerable conditions. This

"AMERICAN TRADITION" is reaching astronomical heights and

becoming an "AMERICAN NIGHTMARE" because the 'three-in one'

about it?: We act as if we've

ecome immune to the

sight of police using violence to break up peaceful demonstaations, using

• violence to break the heads and spirits of our people. We can't allow

these horror--ridden conditions to continue to exist. The police are

already moving for autonomous power in this country. That means they

won't have to answer to anybody not even the lying politician and the

greedy businessman (let alone oppredsed people) for their actions. They will'

be free to come in our communities on their daily search-and-destroy

missions unchecked to wipe us out indiscriminately, caulicant that their

actions not only won't be condemned by their superiors but bill in fact

be cormended and praised by them! An exaggeration? Not by any means, a

fact made painfully clear when we look at the pre-dawn assassination of -

Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark Clark: the vicious murder of Michael and

John Soto, Charkes Jackson and countless others.

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to Its vificial newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December,

1906, in Okland,

Calliornla, to organize black

people su they can take control

•of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black conmunity.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE StALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY

•P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEHTON is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The 01i1clal newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black

people.

Residents of the black community are urged to arm

thenselves against the police who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September T, 1968, contains

an editorial by Bpp Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere: Ars yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

ra a revolutionary culture. Change, Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black Power.

Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

In the october 5, 1968, edition of

"The Black Panther" is the

statenent,".....we will not dissent from American Government.

He

will overthrow it."

Iasues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations iron the

writings of Chairman NAO Tse-tung of the

People a Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political pover grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3306 Shattuck Avenue,

Berkeley, Caltiornia.

Branches have been

established at various locations throughout the United States.

but he's here tonight. He have Mr. BUBBY

we were very fortunale in getting you to

come up and talk with us tonight. All over

the news, of course, we have the commission

come in from Congress and how they ran up a

brick wall. But tell me this right now,

according to the man from the Illinois. Civil

Liberties Union, he said that in his conversa-

tions with JERRIS LEONARD, which was summarily

denied, he said that it was Mr. JERRIS.

LEONARD's conversation with him where Mr.

LEONARD, I guess, said that they were going

to get the Black Panthers, hoodlums,

gangsters, or whatever he. called them.

Of course everything is out of context.

You tell me, would you please Mr. HILLIARD,

you're the Chief of Staff. of the Black

Panther Party. Do you believe that the

Justice Department, the United States

Government, its official arm, its law

arI, 1s out to get the Black Panther Party

violently?

DAVE HILLIARD:

HILLIARD:

:

How do you say this? He have a documentation

of harassments and murders of our Party

members. that date back to 1968, and the

harassments precedes the year of 1968.

So that with this physical evidence and

with the murders beginning with little

BOBBY HADDEN (phonetic) and some 26 members

of our Party that have been viciously

murdered in our communities. I think that•

this serves as a (garbled) indictment that

the United States Government with all other

branches and agencies out to destroy the.

Black Panther Party with violence.

I want to ask you this please. The Black .

Panther Party, are your aims finally, your

final aims to overthrow the United States

Government in its present form?

Our final aim is to realize the system that

would guarantee employment, education, Pair

housing, and to give the people the power

to control the so-called representatives

of government and (garbled) system that

we're presently living under now. That's

our final aim. Of course to recognize

socialism as being the one system by which

people can control the means of production

In our communities and socialism as a weapon

to allow the people

to give full (garbled)

their energies in all areas. But the

ultimacy of our program 1s all power to

the people--a democratic centralized govern-

ment as outlined in the (garbled) Constitution.

Are you comparing your particular credo

against another country or one that's brand

new, one that does not look like any other

country's form of socialism?

First you have to understand that the

ideology and the program of the Black

Panther Party 1s a program that was put

together from the historical experiences

of black people in this country. But our

situation in this country is a

situation because first of all we're subject

to the most inhumane hostilities up to this

point in history. I think that the Indians

are the only other nationality

of people

that had been meted (phonetic) out such

atrocities so that it becomes very important

for people to recognize the Black Panther

Party's program and their legitimate demands

for justice as being the ultimacy of our

program.

Do you believe that the human race as a

whole is capable of warmth, understanding,.

kindness, compassion, freedom, honesty to

all people, black, white, yellow, red, no

matter what color of their skin, do you

believe that the human race is capable of

such a society?

I think that with proper information that

the human race can be all those things that

you mentioned but the very fact that the

media, the television as one example, serves

as a tool to distort and to politically

the right information that's necessary for

them to be the epitome of humanity as you

so describe.

I'm smiling at that because here you are,

you're right in the same camp with AGNEW and

because AGNEW says the same thing, that the

media distorts and discolors and, you want

all media, how you gonna stake (phonetic)

the media out, according to whose truths?

All that we say is that the service, the

ideological service, people like yoursell,

the journalists, that these people should

record facts as they are and not to distort

them. All that we're saying is that the

television cameramen, the journalists,

that their critiques, that their political

essays, that their (garbled) essays for the

Nobel Peace Prize should project the very

realistic situation without distortion.

Now I do not see how you can possibly put

us in the same camp with AGNEW. AGNEW is

here in Chicago has not been (garbled)

that you cannot tell me that this media has

No. I disagree with you completely.. I'll

CHARLES GARRY:

Well I have tremendous faith and confidence

In a free press and a tree press is exactly.

what It means. The difficulties that we've

had in the disgemination of information from

the Black Panther Party is being able to tell

the truth. It's true that since MARK CLARK

and FRED HAMPTON were murdered and the Los

Angeles police

overstayed their police

authority that the press media has been

giving dissemination to the things that the

community has been aware of

for a long long

time. The Black Panther

Party has had a

program for almost three years. They have

projected humanness, qualities, genuineness

and the only time that the media has ever

been interested is if some particular member

of the Black Panther Party did something

that shocked the white racist community.

Then the media would be interested. But

when the Black Panther Party would call a

press conference and talk about breakfast

for children, talk about the health program,

- 12 -

NH 55176 DocId: 32989646 Page 350

## Page 351

they would talk about projection of a better

lile in this world including the United

States, the modia was silent. The reporters

were there but their bosses never printed

the story, the television cameras never

grinded out the project that the Black

Panthers were projecting. It's true that

today after the death of a vallant fighter

and a vallant leader like FRED HAMPTON and

MARK CLARK and others, they're interested

and they should be interested. The working

press is interested. You are interested.

But somehow or other we get sidetracked. 'I

read today in the "United States News and

World Report" an account of the Black Panther

Party. That was not a bilateral article.

It's one-sided. It's lopsided. I'm sure

J. EDGAR HOOVER could have written the

same article and said amen "United States

News and World Report." But these are the

things we're talking about. He don't want

to control press. DAVID HILLIARD and the

FAYE:

Black Panther Party is not advocating à

controlled press. But they are advocating

a free press. We don't care what you say

about the Black Panther Party providing you

allow the Black Panther Parly to state its

position. You can make all the editorial

comments you want to. They don't care

because they understand the free expression

of ideas. This is the area we are talking

about when we talk about the free press

is

not really a free press. Many of the press

have had to take stories away in the last

three yoars because at the advertisers

didn't particularly appreciate the editorial

point of view or the news point of view.

This is the area we're talking about.

And

we're not in the same bag as the Vice

President of the United States.

Well I meant to say in the same bag he was

very critical of the media too, saying that.

they were lopsided as well. And on the other

hand you say they are lopsided too.

And so

we have both ends of the spectrum saying

that the press, the media, is lopsided

No. We're saying it differently.

That I appreciate of course.

We're saying that we are not permitted to

get our story out unless there's something

that's shocking such as someone being killed

or someone making a nasty remark about

somebody. We are saying that all we want

is to be able to toll our side of the story.

AGNEW says that you should not criticize the

President of the United States as though he

has sone particular halo hanging over his

head. He're not saying that. We don't

care how much you criticize the Black

Panther Party providing you give us an

equal opportunity to respond and be able

to tell our side of the story, to be able

to say that racism is here, that the Black

Panther Party is subjected to genocide by

the armed forces of the United States. When

All right, Mr. GARRY, because you weren't

a whole rigamarole here with the conspiracy 8

which is now the conspiracy Y and so on, that

BOBBY SEALE is now in Jail serving a contempt

of court sentence. How are you going to .

fight that action?

He intend to appeal that of course. We

think that the conduct of the court, when

the lacts are known, are going to be shown

it was barbaric, atrocious and not in the

highest standards of American judicial

process. Whan a judictary forgets its

role and becomes a partisan, then we don't

have Justice as we understand it in America.

While we're talking about justice, I have

some great criticisms to make of American

justice. I don't want to compare it with

far as justice is concerned. But

I say that justice

today in America, in

relationship to at least 50 million people,

that includes the blacks, the ghetto blacks,

the ghetto browns, the ghetto reds, the

ghetto yellows, and the ghetto whites do

not get justice in our American courts.

I was indeed surprised that the Attorney

General of Canada, addressing a group of

judges in their conference in San Francisco,

said practically the same thing that I'm

saying today. He have not upgraded our law

where it represents the contemporary needs

of the people today.

Breaking it down you're saying that if a

man is poor and he goes before a judge for

any charge, chances are he'll go to jail.

Yes. Not only will he go to jail, he will

He's completely innocent of it. He goes to

man had

an opportunity for a fair trial?

Has he been properly represented? In the

HUEY NEWTON case, Minister of Defense of the

Black Panther Party, It took 13 weeks to

try that case. A battery of lawyers with

me as trial counsel worked day and night for

almost a year and a half in preparing that

case. Tremendous amount of investigation

was done. Ii the client was able to pay

for it, it would have cost a little over a

nillion dollars in legal time. Little over

a million dollars. And the verdict was a

compromise verdict. He was convicted of

manslaughter for killing a police officer.

It 1t costs a million dollars for a HUEY

course, the Assistant United States Attorney

said that he couldn't lalk, and they were

after him pretty good, especially when he was

confronted by Congressman POWELL about the

fact that a statement was made to the

"Chicago Tribune", why couldn't it be made

to your group. But he made a very interesting

point. The Assistant Attorney said this

particular group was not empowered by

Congress to really be effective or to

be

•legal. And, If this is so, then I'd like to

know how, you know how, these Congressmen

got together to come in for the hearing in

the first place. Do you know?

well, I think that it would be, that what was

happening as far as the black people are

concerned, it goes that the feeling ah, ah,

There's killings, the apartment is left open, and

now the coroner wants to close it, and now they reopen it.

And so many different groups are getting togother trying to

investigate the thing. Mr. GARRY; do you know

if anyone it

all is legally empowered to test this out?

CHARLES GARRY

Ah, let me answer the question in this way. We

demanded a Congressional body to investigate what happened

in Chicago and in Los Angeles, and what's happening to the

Black Panther Party throughout the United States. We cherish...

there's a concerted effort, a conspiracy, to commit genocide

on the Black Panther Party and we said we demanded the hearing

by Congress, but we said that we wanted Congressmen and

Congresswomen who were not part of the House Comnittee on

Un-American Activities or the House Committee on Internal

Security or some other form of garbage that's been handout out

over a period of years. He said we wanted men of good will,

women of good-will in Congress to do this. The black Congress-

men came to our call. We also stated we intended to file a

petition in the United Nations charging the United States

as

a nation within a nation of committing concerted genocide on

the. Black Panther Party and particularly in recent months, and

we intend to file that petition. We told the committee today,

- 23 -

this afternoon, that we intended to rooperate with them in

any way they wanted to. We've also indicated that we in-

tend to cooperate with the committee that was forme

recently,

the Commission, they call themselves, where former Justice

GOLDBERG is at the head of it. With all of these

committees,

we intend to cooperate one hundred percent, but we also intend

to have a caveat.

We intend to have a caveat to this extent

so that there will not be a whitewash of what we know to be

the facts. And no one is going to change those farts.

MARTY FAYE

DAVE, do you think the Black Panthers would have

had any trouble at all if they hadn't said, ah, change the

system of government?

DAVE HILLIARD

I don't think that we would have had to suffer, ah,

the atrocities that have been needed out to our party thus

Par, I think that just like most of the black organizations

that have now become puppets, or other areas within the system,

we too, would have been endarked and possibly given

some

grants, by the Federal government. But the very fact that

we are opposed to the system of capitalism, because of this

explott of our nature, I think that this is the main reason

for all the repression against our party, and our ability to

organize across the racial line.

MARTY FAYE

Yes, but you see, the government doesn't go through

a considered effort to wipe out the Socialist Party in the

United States.

DAVE HILLIARD

That is because the sortalist party in too new

United States is endorsed by the government of the United

States. To make a very distinct difference between people

that advocate socialism through theory and people that

practice it by the very example - our breakfast program,

the free health clinic, our very program, so

that our de-

mands are historical demands that have been felt out and

that have been yearned for by a people in this country since

their embarkation. That's why I say that ideological exper-

ience of blacks in this country. Nothing more than that.

CHARLES GARRY

I'm down here with Mr. HILLIARD to meet with the

members of the Central Committee of the Black Panther Party

this evening, which we've already met. Tomorrow morning we

intend to have a conference of warriors throughout the United

MARTY FAYE

Can I ask you sir, how your foes are paid?

CHARLES GARRY

our fees are paid by gratitude, being able to

make a contribution to a better world. Until I but in-

volved with the Black Panther Party I was bringing in between

$150 - 200,000 a year in fees to the firm I'm

with. Since

October 27, 1968, I've brought in $31,000 and our costs

alone in the HUEY NEWTON case were over $70,000. I'm not

talking about expenses and the cost of defending and repre-

senting members of the Black Panther Party, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER,

BOBBY SEALE and all others. The firm I'm with is financially

being horribly drained. 1

But, we are getting the gratitude,

the gratitude of being able to do something within yourselves!

to make a contribution, for the responsibilities that the

white society has had for 400 years and has falled. And it

is our responsibility, and I hope my fellow white citizens of

America, will join us and make some contributions, financially.

The Black Panther Party needs money. Our firm needs some, money

to be able to carry on. Other lawyers are in this light. wIlliaM

KUNTSLER, LEONARD WEINGLASS, are in that courtroom before

Judge HOFFMAN day in and day out, and I'm satisfied that that

Judge, no matter what the verdict is, intends to send Bill.

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black lanther

Party (BPP) was started durins Vicember, 1966, In Okland,

California,

to organtze blick prople so they can tike control

of

the llie, polltics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SElLE, BPP Chairman, and HUtY

P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEYTON is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of in Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which furthe

describes Itself as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the BPp advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tacties

in its revolutionary program to und oppression of the black

people.

Residents of the black community are urged to arm

in the pable to the pale

polire who ire consistently referred to

in the publication is "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" Issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MUNRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Blark men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere: Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

'The Black Panther" 15 the

statement,"

He will overthrow it,"

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the

writings of Chalrman MAO Tse-tung of the

At approximately 3:15 a.m., November 13,

1969, a spokesman from

the Deputy Superintendents

Office, Chicago PD, Chicago, Illinois, advised that

moments

earlier officers responding to a report of

a "man with a shotgun" at 5802 Calumet, Chicago,

located in a south side Negro ghetto, were met with

gunfire from at least two male Negroes.

The first three officers to arrive at the scene

Were JOHN GILHOOLY, white male, age 21; MICHAEL BRADY,

aRe 26. sir area and DANIEL COrPUAN, white male,

officers were shot, according to

the Chicago PD spokesman, before they

got their guns

out of their holsters..

## Page 382

GILHOOLY and BRADY were approaching the building

from the

front when a Negro male with a shotgun and a male

Negro with a carbine fired on them.

GILHOOLY Subsequently

died on November 14, 1969, from his wounds and BRADY

received a head wound for

which he was treated at a

Iocal hospital and released. COFFMAN recelved gunshot

wounds in the

log, hand and chest and is hospilalised.

scores of policemen then responder and

firing

continued for almost one half hour. Six other Chicago

officers received wounds as a result of this gunfight:

FRANK RAYPAPORT, while male, age 3l, who

was

killed by a

shotgun blast in the lace;

DONALD MILEY, white male, age unavailable,

shot in face

arm by a shotgun blast

and

lost his right eye; is hospitalized.

and his condition is serious;

PHILIP PREROST, white male, age 27, who

Another

suspect in the shooting, LANCkS.

BELL, Negro male, age 20, of 5809 South Indiana,

Chicago, was shot

and caplured in the alley behind

shooting incident. BELL was wounded in the leg and

right arm and has

been charged with murder.

He is

currently incarcerated at the Bridewell Hospital,

Chicago.

The police report on the incident reflects

that the incident was apparently the result of

previous personal altercation between BELL and one

JAMES CALDWELL, male Negro, 5804 South Calumet, who

is a guard at the Cook County Jail, Chicago.

As a result of this altercation, BELL, WINTERS,

and possibly others

went to CALDWELL'S home looking foi

him. He was not at home, and CALDWELL'S wife

then called the Chicago PD. It was this call that

officers

of the PD were responding to.

The area outside the scene of the shooting

remained calm and

no large crowds gathered.

A spokesman for the Deputy Superintendent's

Office, Chicago PD, advised that the Chicago PD is in

the process of attempting to determine how many

people actually took part in the shooting and is

looking for at least one and possibly two male

Negroes, details unknown, whom they believe took part

in this

shooting.

A source advised that BELL, although carried.

as a membar of the Illinois Chapter of the BPY, is

not a trusted member of that Party inasmuch as

and

was suspected of baing an informant for the Black

P Stone Rangers, a local Negro youth gang. BELL has

been inactive for several months, almost

since joining

the Party, due to this suspicion.

This

source advised that WINTERS, also known

as JAKE WINTERS, was a close associate of the BPK, but

was not a member.

He was very knowledgeable in weaponry

and is suspected of stealing several weapons

from BPY

headquarters.

- 12-

HH 55176 DocId: 32989646 - Page 383

## Page 384

Source advised, however, that the BPP is

now claiming that both BELL and WINTERS were upstanding

BPP members and are attempting to obtain their

photographs and will publish the story concerning

the

incident in the BPt newspaper in the near

future.

, 11/13/69)

Source advised that allegedly the following

items are

being kept in

The Black Panther Party benan as a response to

reneated instances

of police violence in the black communito.

The narty was laspired by

the

Black Panther Party of Lowndes Countr

Alabama (The Lowndes County

Freedom pranization) which oroanized black neonle in the south to ob-

tain basie riahts such as the right to vote.

The symbol of the Lowndes

County Freedom Armanization was the Black Panther.

The black nanther, as exnlained bu Minister of Defense Huey P. New-

ron,

the

• Black Panther Party will not attack unless nushed un against the wall-

where nothinn alse is nossible but to attack its assallants - in order

ta 11v2.

This princinle of armed self-defense which is basic to the

BTack Panther Party, will be exnlained in a document below.

The Black Panther Party, started by Huey Nawton and Bobby Seale

while students at Merritt College in Oakland, set out priginally to le-

They carried wearons as nrovided by law and

staved the lenal distance from the nolice whom they watched.. The result

of this surveillance was a decrease in brutality against members of th.

black communitv and increased harrassment of

the Black Panther Party

by the nolice.

The leaders of the Black Panther Party (originally called the Black

Fanther Party for Self Defense) soon realized that the police did not

make the ultimate decisions as to whom they attacked and why.

The no-

lice acted as the law enforcement agenor for those who made

the politi-

cal decisions.

Thus, the Black Panther Party evolved a nolitical prog

to deal with the tyne of political decisions which

allowed the nolice

to harrass the black communities and which have resulted in the dreadfu.

Tivino conditions of black neonle in this country. (Details of thès

program may be found in a document below).

Huey Newton has sald that the Black Panther Party is the vanouard

nardy of the mass of black peonle.

The black

community has not yet beer

to act unon them in

Both these men have nublicly

As Minister of communication, Kachleen Cleaver has said, since the

• POLITICS AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY

The Black Panther Party program and platform is a result of the an-

• alysis that the Party,

esnecially its leader, Huey Newton, has made

of the nature of politics in America.

The way to political chande is

through nower. This is the nature

of the black nower movement exennlified by Stokeley Carmichael in

that

What does this meadn?

Huev Newton has said that politics is

war without bloodshed and

that war is an extension of nolitics with

bloodshed, The reason that

the Reconstruction attemnt to put blacks

into office from the south failed was because

the black legislators,

intelligent, well-educated men, had no nowerful constituency behind

them.. If you represent a soverless aroun in the legislature, then you

wield no nower.

What is a nowerful aroun?

According to minister of

Defense, Newton, a nowerful groun

is one which, if it doesn't det

what it wants,

can deliver a consequence. There are several ways in

which this kind of nower is obtained.

one way is to own the land.

This is feudal nower.

It is exercised by farmers who, when they do

not get what they want, can let the crons rot in the field. This is

the kind of consequence that rates attention and action.

Yhe second

way of gaining power is economic: ownershin of the businesses.

In

America the slaves were freed with the promise, by the Freedmen's

Bureau, of forty acres and two mules. Had this promise been fulfilled,

the black man would have had land power and the ability to inflict a

a consequence.

The promise, of course, was never fulfilled.

What about businesses?

The businesses in the black community are

owned by the white man.

Thus, even the economic boycott is difficult

because there are not

sufficient black-owned businesses to serve as

anel

alternative center for purchasing

basic needed goods.

To ask the blacks to redress

their grievances by running for

office does not pose a realistic solution.

It is true that members

of the Black Panther Party - Huey

Newton

for Congress in the ith

Congressional District - Bobby Scale for Assembly in the 17th As-

sembly District

in Alameda County

- and Kathleen LCleaver for As

sembly in th 18th Assembly District in San Francisco - are running

for office on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, but this is only

to have a forum to articulate the grievances of

the black community.

Why? Because as stated above the black nolitician without a nower-

ful constituency just warms a chair in the leoislature.

If the black community cannot main economic or land-nower, how

can they hone to have channes of their conditions? Minister of

Defense Huey Mewton says

that the only other source of nower left is

that of the ability to inflict destruction as

a consequence:, Thus,

the black people must arm

in a political fashion.

The black

peoble

must be able to deal with the occunation police

forces in their

communities when they

are attacked. The alternative is to have the

police chosen by the black community, live in the black community,

and. serve

the needs of the black community as that community sees

them.

This would mean that the nolice would no longer act

merely to

defend the interests of the white businessman and suumlord.

However, the blacks do not limit themselves to discussion of nower.

from the nun. The Black Panther Party has a nolitical program which

it would like to sec

chacted for the benefit of black neonle. see

below for the program.

• WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE BLACK MAN IN AERICA TODAY?

Eldridge Cleaver, Black. Panther Minister of Information has stated

that the black man is

a colonial subject and that black America

colony within white America.

The fact that the colonial subjects are

dispersed throughout the country does not make their colonial sub-

jugation any

the less real.

Cleaver has stated that:

"Black peonle

in North America have always been nlagues by a dual status. He were

boch slave and christian,

we were both free and segregated, we are

both integrated

and colonized. In the nast this duality has worked

70 our disadvantage.

It kept us running around in circles. Today

we propose to turn it to our advantage, in the manner that we have

turned our blackness

from a disadvantage into a rallying noint of

advantage."

: Huey Newton has said that the black men in America today is a

man

of confusion.

He is of the lower socie-economic background. He

has withdrawn from his hostile enviroment which he daily faces and

denies his own ability.

He has been taught that he is inferior and

he- blames himself.

He tries to change this imane through his style:

of life - his

desire for flashy material nossessions.

He is asked

to resnect a law which does not resnect him.

Those who believe in

cultural

nationalism

try to answer his nroblem by turning him

to the time of the eleventh century in Africa.

However, his free-

dom cannot come from such an identification.

His freedom will come

from identifying with the revolutionary strungles.of

neonle of color

all over the world, includina Africa

today. The black man, accord-

ing to Cleaver, has

common culture and a common history.

A17 she

jacks to be a nation is land.

What is the History of the Black Man in America?

The history of the nresent acettude of the whites toward blacks

in this country has docp psycholonical roots, according to Navton.

le dates to the time, hundreds of years ano, when the white Europeans

first came into contact with black Africans. It relates

to cultural

differences.

The curopeans the came to Arrica worshipped oris god -

à god

who was all-nood.

This was

his absolutism.

Man was said to

have been created in the image of

the all-nood god and therefore could

do no evil.

Man's instinctual sexual drives were deemed ungod-like

and were repressed. Such evil was deemed to come from cutside man-

the result of demons, devi?s, and witches - who were burned at the

stake:

"On the other hand, the Africans below the Sahara, mostly black,

had a differant form of worshin.

Their nod was both

good and bad.

They believed in dualism. Their

nod had two or more heeds - one good

and one bad.

The African had to avoid being like the had head and

must.net into the bavor of the good head.

However, he did

not deny

nart of his beina as comino from outside himseif.

Thus, his sexual

drives were rare of him - not evil demons from

the outside.

When the Euroneans came to Africa they enslaved the blacks south

of the Sahara who beiieved

in dualism.

They were told by the church

that the "rood" Africans

north of the sahara, unn believed in a single

40d, were more in line with

What he was saying is that even with an

The Euroneans raned Africa economically and took the black men as

WHY FREE HUEY NEWTON?

1. The Political Reasons. Huey P. Newton

is a nolitical prisoner.

He is in jail today, accused of killing an Dakland noliceman, not

because

he commited this crime, which he did not, but because he is

the Minister of

Defense of the Black Panther Party. Since the incep.

tion of

the

Party the Oaklard police have tried to harrass

it out

of existence. As the Party became stronger, the nolice tactics became

more vicious. The police have long had the

license numbers

and

des -

criptions of all the cats driven by members of the Black Panther Party,

on the night of October 28, 1967, Police Officer Frey stinned

an automobile which he knew to be a car on the list of those driven

by Black Panthers.

He stopned the car for an alleged traffic violation,.

the nature of which has

never been discloes.

In his testimony. before

the Grand Jury, Officer Heanes, the police officer who was summoned

by Frey

to come io his assistance after he stonned the Panther car,

said. that Newton. DIC NOT HAVE A GUN. Attorney Charles Garry has in-

dicated that the evidence poinis to the real nossibility

that both

officers fired at each other and the officer Heanes'

bulleis killed

Officer Frey.

The nolice have

always, in the black conmunity, claimed the right

to exercise indiscriminate

violence.

It was for this reason that

the Black Panther Party

was priginally formed.

Before October 28th

the Dakland nolice had harrassed Newton on numerous occasions and

had threatened his life.. On October 28 Newton was arrested and shot

in the stomach

because. he stood

for change in the black

community.

The blark community knows that huey laston and the Panthers. have

If black nolitical leaders are

The Legal Reasons. Huey Mewion was

The persons chosen to serve are, overhelminaly,

and

This method

of

ever, when Rewion's attorneys aresented ints evidence to ene

Furthermore, the method of indictment denied Newton fundamental

They felt that the Panther nro-

He was annointed Party Treasurer.

He served the black community faithfully until his murder at the

WHY SELF DEFENSE?

The Black Panther Party has advocated that everyone in the black

community have a qun to defend himself.

It should be made very clear

that this does NOT mean that black neonle should have suns in order

to

come into the white

community and "shoot it un"

In fact there

are NO reported incidents of Black Panthers coming into ANY community

and using their weapons other than to defend their own lives.

The nolice forces in the black community are composed of men who

live in white communities. They are hired as occupation forces to

natrol the black community to motect white business

and land

interests.

His family was denied the riche to motogranh his body and the rinhe

to have his clothes returied in them.

Denzil Dowell was unarmed.

Furthermore the sheriffs know that he was suffering from an unjured

The Party School

success.

I mould like to say something about the problem of cur Party's

style of work.

Why must there be a revolutionary party? There must be a reve-

lutionary party because the world contains enomies who oppross the

people and the people want to throw off enemy oppression.

¿ra of cepitalism and imperinlism, just such a revolutionery party

as the Communist Party is needed.

Without such a party it is simply

Suet such a for it any at y

We aro

communists, we want to lead the peoplo in overthrowing the enemy, and

so we must keep our ranks in good order, we must march in stew, our

troops must be picked troops and our weapons good weapons,

Without these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown.

What is the problem now facing our Party? The general line of ti

the Party is correct and presents no problem, and the Party's

work has been fruitful. The Party has several hundred thousand

minbers who are leading the people in extremely hard and bitter

struggles against the onemy. This is plain to everybody and

beyond all doubt,

Then is there

or is there not any problem still facing our

Priety?

I say there is and, in a certain sense, the problem is

quite serious,

Shhat is the proolem? It is the fact that there is some

thing in the minds of a number of our comraies which strikes one

as not quite right, not trite proper.

In other words,

there is still something wrong with our

style

si study, with our style in the Party's internal and external

celations and with our style of writing. By something wrong with

the style of study we mean the malady of subjectivism.

By some-

thing wrong with cur style in Party relations we mean

the maindy

By sonething wrong with the style of writing

wer mean the malady of stereotyped Party writing.

All these are

Although no longer

Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to

oi these problans,

he central Committee of our Party has now made a decision

calling upon our comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist

Leninist stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study of

Chinas history, and of China's economics, politics, military

affairs and culture, and to analyse every problem concretely on

the basis of detailed material and then draw theoretical conclu

sions.

This is the responsitility we must shoulder,

Our concades in the Party School should not regard Marxist

theory as lifeless dogma,

It is necessary to master Marxist the-

ory and apply it, master

it for the sule purpose of applying it.

•If you can apply the Marxist-leninist viewpoint. in elucidating

one or two practical problems, you shoule be commended and cre-

disad with some achievement.

The more problems you elucidate and

the more comprehensively and profuondly you do so, the greater

will be your achievement, Our Party School should also lay down

ynr tads rule to grade students good or poor accoring to how

Ly and whether or not they see them at all.

Since China is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country and her cult

ure is not well developed, intellectuals are particularly treasured

on this question of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of

the Party made the decision over two years ago that we should vin

over the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they are

revolutionary and willing to take part in the resistance to Japan,

It is entirely right for us to esteem

intellectuale, for without revolutionary intellectuals

the revo

lution cannot triumph. But we all know there are many intellec

tuals san as who fancy themselves very learned and assume airs of

erudition without realizing that such airs are bad and harmiul

and hinder their own progress.

They ought to be aware of the

trugh

that actually many so-called intellectuals are, relatively

szeaking, most ignorant anta the workers and peasants sometimes

know more than they do. Here some will say,

"Ha! You are turning

things upside down and

talking nonsense."

But, sany comrades

don't get excited: there is some sense in what I am

saying.

What is Knowledge? Ever since class society came into being

The world has known only two kinds of knowledge, knowleige of the

struggle for production and knowledge of the class strusale,

Natural science and social science are the crystalizations of

these two kinds of knowledge, and philosophy is the rencralization

It is a question of the method ci thinking

the attijude of all Party comrades in their work.

As such, It

is a question of extraordinary, indeed of primary, importance.

Certain muddled ideas find currency among many people.

are, for instance, muddled ideas about what is a theorist: what

is an intellectual

and what is meant by linking theory and prac-

tice.

Let us first ask, is the theoretical level of our Party high

or low? Recently more Marxist Lenist works have been translated

and more people have been reading them.

That is a very good

thing,

But can ve therefore a say that the theoretical level of

1u5 Party has been greatly raised? True, the level is now some

what higher than before,

But our theoretical front is very much

out of harmony with the rich content of the Chinese

revolutionary

movement, and a comparison of the twe shows that the theoretical

side is lagging far behind, Generally spoaking,

as

and not crude and sketchy?

Especially in the field of economic

theory: Chinese capitalism has had a century of development

since the opium war, and yet not a single theoretical work had

been urduced which

What is most important is to be good at

Therefore, I

advise those whe have only booklcarning but as yet no confact •

realize their own short comings and become a little nire modest.

How can those who have only booklaerning be turned into intel-

lectuals in the true sense? The only way is to get them to take

part in practical work and become practical wirkers,

to get those

engaged in theoretical work to study important practical problems.

In this way our say aim can be attained.

What I have said will probably make some yeople angry.

They

will say,

"According to your explanation, even Marx would not be

regarded as an intellcctual."

•I say they are wrong. Marx took

part in the practice of the revolutionary movement and also

created revolutionary theory, Beginning with the comonity, the

simplest element of capitalism, he made a thoroligh study or the

economic stricture of capitalist society. Millions of peopic saw

and handled commodities overy day but were so used to them that

they took no notice.

Marx alone studied comm.dities scientifi

cally; He carried

out a tremendous work of research into their

actual development and derived a nature,

history and proletarian

revolution and created dialectical materialisn, hostorical mater-

ialism and the theory of proletarian revolution.

thus Marx became

a most completely developed intellectual, representing the acme of

human wisdom, he was fundamentally different

from those who have

only booh-learning.

Marx undertook detailed investigations and

studies in the course of practical struggles, formed generaliza-

a large number of comrades who will learn how to do

sich work..

Chinese revolution? To use a common expression, it is by "shoot-

the arrow at the target"

As the arrow is to the target, so

is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution.

Some comrades,

however, are "shooting without a target"

, shooting at random, and

such people are liable to harm the revolution.

Others merely s*

stroke the arrow fondly, exclaiming, "What a fine arrow! What a

fine arrow!," but never

want to shoot it. These people are only

connoisseurs of curios and have virtually nothing to do with the

revolution, The arrow of Marxism-Leninism must be used to shoot

at the target of the Chinese revolution,

Unless this point is

made clear, the theoretical level of our Party can never be raised •

and the chinese revoltuion can never be victorious.

Onu comrades must understand that we shudy Marxism-Leninism

solely because it is the science which leads the revolutionary

cause of the proletariat to victory.

Even now, there are not a

Let me now speak about the question of sectarianism,

Having been steeled fos twenty years, our Party is no. longer

dominated by sectarianism.

Remnants of

sectarianism, however,

are still found both in the Party's internal relations and in

external relations.

its

Sectarian tendencies in internal relations

lead to exclusiveness towards people outside the Party and hinder

inner-Party unity and solidarity, while sectarian tendencies

external relations lead to exclusiveness towards people outside

the Party and hinder the Party in its task of uniting the whole

people.

Only by uprooting this evil in both its aspects can

the Party advance unimpeded in its great task of achieving unity

among all Party comrades and

What are the remnants of inner Party sectarianism? They are

mainly as follows:

First, the assertion of "independence".

Some comrades see only

the interests of the part and not the wholes they always pui un

due stress on that part of the work for which they themselves are

responsible and always wish to subordinate the interests of the

whole to the interests of their own part.

They do not understand

the Partyas system of democratic centralism, they do not realize

that the Communist Party not only needd democracy but needs cen-

tralization even more.

They forget the system of democratic.

centralism in which the minority is subordinate to the majority,

che Lower lever to the higher level, the part to the whole and

the entire membership to the Central Committee,

Chang Kuo-tao

asserted his "independence" of the Central Committee of the

Party and as a result "asserted" himself into betraying the Party

became a Kuomintang agent.

Although the sectarianism we are

now discussing is not of this extremely serious kind, it must

still be guarded against and we must do away completely with all

manifestations of disunity.

We should encourage comrades to

take the interests of the whole into account.

Every Party mem-

ber, every. branch of work, every statement and every action must

proceed from the interests of the whole Party, it is absolutely

impermissible to fiolate chis principle.

Those who assert this kind of "independence" are usually wedded

though in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice

they out themselves first and the Party second. What are these

They are after fame and position and want to be in

Whenever they are rut in charge of a branch of

work, they assert their "independence", With this aim, they draw

gome

people in, push others out and resort to boasting, flattery

and touting among the comrades, thus importing the vulgar style of

che

bourgeois political parties into the Communist Paity.

It is

their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief. I believe

we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is

absnlutaly impossible to accomplish anything in this world.

Which

are the honest Beople? Marx,

Engels, Lenin and Stalin are honest,

men of science are honest.

Which are the dishonest people? Trot

SKy, Bukharin, Chen Iu hsiu and Chang Kuo-tao are extremely dis

honest, and those who assert "independence" out of personal or

sectional interest are dishonest too.

There is no time

quay to talk about the a

tion of stereo-

typed Party writing

I shall discuss it at anowner meeting.

Ster-

eotyped Party writing is a vehicle for filth, a form oi expression

for subjectivism and sectarianism.

It does people harm and

damages

the revolution, and we must get rid of it. completely.

To combat subjectivism we must propagate materialism and dia-

lectics:

However, there are many comrader in our Party who lay

no stress on the propaganda either of materialism or of dialectics

and regard it with equanim

ity. They think they believe in Marxism, but make no effort to

propagate materialism and do not give it

opinion

when they hear or read subjectivist stuff. This is not

the attitude of a Communist.

It allows many of our comrades to

be poisoned by subjectivist ideas, which numb their sensitivity.

Be should therefore launch a canpäign of enlightenment withing

the Party to free the minds of our comrades from the fog of sub-

jectivism and dogmatism and should call upon them to buycott sub-

jectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing,

Such evils

are like Japanese goods, for only our enemy wishes us to preserve

them and continue to befuddle ourselves with them, so we should

advocate a boycott against them, just as we boycott Japanese

goods, We should boycott all the wares of subjectivism, sectar-

ianiem, and stereotyped Party writing, make their sale cifficult,

and not allow their purveyors to ply their trade by exploiting the

low theoretical level in the Party. Our comrades must develop

a good nose for this purposes they should take a sniff at everthing

and disiinguish the good

from the bad before they decide whether

to welcome it or boycott it.

Communists must always go into the

whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully

think over whether or not it corresponds to reality and is rcally

well founded, on no account should they follow blindly and encour- •

age slavishness.

FInally, in opposing subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped

Party writing we must have in mind two purposes:

first, "learn

from past mistakes to avoid future ones"

, aid second, "cure the

sickness to save the patient"

The mistakes of the past must be

exposed without sparing anyone's sensitilities, it is necessary to

analyse and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientisic

attitude so that work in the future will be done more carefully

and done better.

This is what is meant by "learn from past mis-

takes to avoid future ones"

But our aim in exposing errors and"

critizing shortcomings, like that of a doctor curing a sickness,

is solely to save the

patient and

not to doctor him to death.

We who li

an increasingly evident truth: we have no control over the

institutions which govern our lives. For our survival and

the survival of our fraedoms, we must now demand control

of these forces, particularly that one which we confront

daily in our communities and which niten makes the final

decision regarding our lives... or deaths: the POLICE

DEPARTMENT.

These racist police have been used as forces working

against the necole and in cahoots with the corrunt political

figures. These lying politicians and murdering, brutalizing

solice, joined by the greedy businessmen like Hunt and

Dupont, are in control of our destinies. .It is become an

"AMERICAN TRADITION" for police to prevent the American neople

from protesting

these intolerable conditions. This

"AMERICAN TRADITION." is reaching astronomical heights and

becoming an "AMERICAN NIGHTIARE" because the 'three-in one'

described above needs to sunress the ever nrowing activity

of onoressed menole to be free once their ayes are onenad to

Daley and Hanrahan (remember shoot-to-kill and the war on gangs) must

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, In Oakland,

Callfornia, to organize black people so they can take control

of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUbY

P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEWTON is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of

an

Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which furth

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black

people. • Residents of the black community are urged to arm

themselves against the police who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everyuhere. Arm yoursalves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite: Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

In the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" Is the

statement,"

.....we will not dissent from American Government.

We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations Iron the

writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political pover giows out of the barrel of a-gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue,

Berkeley, California.

Branches have been

established at various locations throughout the

United States.

STUDENTS POR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the students for a Demoritte

Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came inlo being at a

founding convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron,

Michigan.

From an initlal posture of "partiripatory dinocricy". the line

of the national leadership has

sevenlod i growing Marxist-

Leninist adherence which currently calls for the building of

a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrontly, the program

of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-

Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-impurialist

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regurded as the leaders

of worldwide struggles against United States imperlalism wherens

the Soviet Union 1s held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1959, SDS National Convention, Progressive •

Labor Party (PLP) forces in

the organization were expelled.

As a result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its

National Reacquarters at 1608 Heat Madison Street, Chicago,

and the Ple faction set up headquarters in Camoridge,

Massachusetts. This headquarters subsequently moved

to

Boston.

Each group elected its own national officers, which.

include three national secretaries and a National Interim

Committoe of eight.

Both the No forces and the pLe forces

claim to be

the true SDs.

Both groups also print their

versions of "New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and thu

program of

particular faction.

The NO version of "New

Left Notes" was recently printed

undor the title "The Fire

Next Time" to achieve a broador mass appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within

the No group,

namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth

Movement (RYM) i laction, and the RYM

II faction.

Weatherman

is action oriented upholding Castro's position thit the duty

of revolutionarles

is to make revolution.

Weatherman is

regarded by RYU II as an adventuristig, allist faction which

denies the historical role of the working class as the base

for revolution. RYM II maintains that revolution, although

desired, is not possible under present conditions, hence

Although disclaiming control and domination by the

Conmunist Party, USA, leaders in these two factions have in

the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and to follow

the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-

Chinese connunist Iines.

A second source has advised that the PLI laction which

.. Is nore conmonly known as the Worker Student Alliance Is dominate

and controlled by members of the PLP, who are required to

identily themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-leninist

philosophy of the PLP.

They advocate that an alliance between

workers and students is vital to the bringing about of a

revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and untversity and college chapters,

although operating under the outlines of the SDS National

Constitution, are autononous in nature and free to carry out

independent policy reflective of local conditions. Because

of this autonomy internal struggles reflecting the major factiona

Interests of SDS have occurred. at the chapter level since

the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

1. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS ACT OF 1959 - FBI CANNOT

ABSORB ANY COSTS INCIDENT THERETO

The provisions of this new legislation, which was enacted by the

86th Congress, First Session, and approved by the President, become effective

July 1, 1960.

Its purpose is to provide health insurance for Federal employees,

annuitants, and their families. Employees will have the option of selecting from

four health plans. with a wide range of benefits. The legislation provides that the

Government will contribute 50% of the premium cost of the plan selected, subject

to stated minimum and maximum ranges.

We cannot accurately estimate the cost to the FBI of these new

benefits until the Civil Service Commission has dealt with the insuring groups

to determine the cost of the plans and until the employees have selected the

desired coverage. Preliminary estimates, however, indicate an added cost of

approximately $1, 000, 000 per year to the

FBI as the employer's cost of these

new benefits, based on the Bureau's experience derived from the operation of its

present health coverage plan.

The appropriation request of this Bureau represents an absolute

minimum figure. All avenues of possible savings were thoroughly explored in

arriving at the minimum figure requested. As a result, it will be impossible

for the FBI to absorb any part of the added cost resulting from the Federal

Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959.

2. ADMINISTRATION'S 2% SAVINGS PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR 1960

Budget Director Stans, in a letter dated September 21, 1959, to

the Attorney General, stated the President had asked him to request the continued

cooperation of the Attorney General in reducing civilian employment in the Govern-

ment. The letter pointed out that auring the fiscal year 1959 executive agencies

effected a 2% reduction in employment and that the tresident would like to effect

a similar reduction in the fiscal year 1960, and requests the Attorney General to

give personal direction to the program and to plan his operations so as to accomplish

HH

it. The reduction would be effected by not filling vacancies as they occur and

by not establishing new positions. The letter further directs that agency plans

for personnel reductions or facts as to why an agency head believes the requested

2% reduction is impracticable be presented to the Budget Bureau with the

October financial plan.

. In connection with the 2% savings program in effect during the fiscal

year 1959, the Bureau advised the Attorney General that it would be impossible

to make any such reduction as the Bureau's operations were already on a "striet

austerity" basis.

The Department cut our fiscal year 1961 budget request by $400, 000,

reducing it from $117, 500, 000 to $117, 100, 000, thereby eliminating 45 employees

for the field (30 Special Agents and 15 clerks).

The Bureau is in no position to effect a 2% reduction in personnel

during fiscal year 1960. Our work loads in all categories continue to be heavy

with no sign of any abatement. Legislation enacted in the closing days of Congress,

specifically the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, will

further bolster our work volumes for which funds have not been provided and to

attempt to reduce our personnel by 2% would seriously impair this Bureau's

ability to discharge its responsibilities in all fields of work.

3. SALARY RETENTION ACT, PUBLIC LAW 85-737

This act provides a two-year period of salary retention for employees

demoted through no fault of their own if they have occupied a higher paying position

for two years or longer. This act has caused a most inequitable situation by

requiring employees who accepted temporary promotions to be paia more than

permanent employees who are doing identical work. By memorandum dated

July 17, 1959, we urged the Department to recommend legislation so as to change

this situation at the earliest possible time. To date no legislation has been

introduced which would effect the desired correction of this inequitable situation.

INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

1. 16-20r-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 Public Lawy

The new labor law, as above, became effective upon its signing

by the President on September 14, 1959.

The language in the Act conferred authority upon the Secretary of

Labor to conduct investigations of the majority of the provisions contained

in the law. Authority was also granted to the Secretary of Labor to enter

into agreements with other agencies to handle investigations.

The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice during September,

1959, has held conferences with officials of the Department of Labor for the

purpose of arriving at an agreement to be signed by the Departments of Justice

and Labor specifying those criminal provisions of the law, as well as the

prohibition against a member of the Communist Party holding office in a

labor union, which the FBI will investigate.

Preliminary conferences indicate investigative jurisdiction of the

following violations will be conferred upon the Bureau:

Embezzlement of union funds; payment by an employer of a fine

imposed upon a labor union officer; prohibition against communists and

convicted felons holding union office; picketing for extortion purposes;

deprivation by force or violence of rights of union members; and retention by

FBI of an amendment in the Act broadening the Labor-Management Relations

Act of 1947.

The finalizing of the agreement between the Departments of Justice

and Labor has not been effected. Until it is, we are not initiating investi-

gations without a specific reguest from the Department of Justice.

We have, however, received 85 specific requests from the Criminal

Division to determine whether certain convicted felons are holding office at

this time in labor unions in violation of that section of the Act (Section 504).

We have also received 52 names of individuals who are reportedly

labor union officials, from the Department, requesting a check of Bureau and

Identification Division files. Eighteen such name checks have been completed.

These were highly placed Teamster officials and trustees. We are not

processing the remaining 34 names until the Department provides us with

further identifying data as to the individuals.

FEDERAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION

Various proposals have been brought forth in the past

by individuals such as Senator Kefauver, Chief William Parker of

the Los Angeles Police Department, Milton Wessel of the Department,

and Senator McClellan for the establishment of a central Federal

clearinghouse of information on crime. More recently New York

State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz has proposed a clearing-

house of information concerning frauds on the consumer and

investor public.

Our position in the past has consistently been that there

is no need for such a clearinghouse and that the necessary and

desirable dissemination of criminal-type information is already

being accomplished within the framework of existing law enforcement

structures.

Some of the serious objections to such a proposed

clearinghouse are that it would be an unwarranted intrusion of

the Federal Government into local affairs. There is the possibility

that such a clearinghouse would provide an official medium for the

dissemination of unverified data consisting of rumor and gossip

and that corrupt and irresponsible individuals would be presented

with the opportunity to use such information for purposes of blackmail

or extortion. In addition to the foregoing, the establishment of such

a clearinghouse would constitute a costly superstructure on already

existing facilities and could result in the establishment of a "black

list" characterizing certain individuals as violators on the basis of

information not completely verified or authenticated.

The Bureau already disseminates on a cally basis

innumerable items of information to local, county, state and

Federal agencies. This information may not only relate to matters

over which we have jurisdiction but extends to any items which may

be of interest to other agencies. The channels for dissemination of

information are already established and the use of these channels by

all agencies would appear to obviate the need for any central clearing-

house of information.

3. NEED FOR CRIMINAL-TYPE LEGISLATION

Since April 30, 1958, the Bureau has suggested certain items

of legislation relative to establishing some effective curbs on the activities of

racketeers. The most recent communication to the Department in this regard

was a memorandum to Deputy Attorney General Walsh dated September 2,

1959, captioned "Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session."

These legislative suggestions are as follows:

I There appears to be a need for legislation to prohibit the

interstate transportation of certain gambling paraphernalia, such as number

slips and punch boards in addition to the present prohibition of interstate

transportation of slot machines.

2 It also appears the interstate transmission of gambling.

information should be restricted to prohibit the transmission of gambling

information in interstate or foreign commerce by any communication facility.

Such legislation should also encompass the transmission of information as to

the results of horse racing events until after a specified time had elapsed.

The inability to have current race results would discourage the operations of

bookmaking establishments.

3. Inasmuch as under the present provisions of the Internal

Revenue Code income derived from illegal businesses and from gambling.

constitutes income which is taxable and assessed in the same manner as

legitimate income, it appears that if the income from such illicit sources were

taxed at vastly higher rates it might make such activities financially prohibitive.

Inasmuch as certain individuals would attempt to avoid such taxes, it might

be desirable to initiate legislation to provide substantial criminal penalties for

the failure to pay such taxes.

4 It also appears legislation may be desirable to amend the •

White Slave Traffic Act in order that the prostitute herself could be prosecuted.

There is considerable activity among those who are engaged in this livelihood

and who go from state to state in order to ply their träde.

5. As an added weapon against organized crime, it appears it

may be desirable to afford consideration to the enactment of a Federal habitual

criminal act which would provide for mandatory sentences upon the commission

of offenses within Federal jurisdiction.

In addition, the Bureau is in agreement with the Administration's

theory of amending the Fugitive Felon Act to include damage by fire or

explosives to religious or educational facilities. The House Judiciary Committee

has failed to approve this proposal and has adopted a bill (H. R. 8601) which would

prohibit damage to any building, structure, facility, vehicle or dwelling house.

It is our view that such legislation should be restricted to cover educational

and religious facilities only. This was called to the Department's attention

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

On March 12, 1959, the Director attended a conference in the Attorney

General's office in connection with current security programs and matters

collateral thereto. The Director expressed the view that security programs

had been held in abeyance in the Department of Justice with the result that

other agencies of the Government were taking advantage of such delays and

offering as excuses for nonaction the fact that the Department of Justice

had not yet indicated what should be done or should not be done in view of

some decisions of the courts and anticipated decisions of the courts. The

Director urged that basic action should be taken on certain of these programs.

While some of these matters have been acted upon, others are still pending and

• are set forth below for the Director's information.

(1) Industrial Security Program - At the time of the March conference it

was decided to wait until the Greene and Taylor cases had gone through the

Supreme Court. This has now occurred and the Supreme Court has indicated

that there was not proper authority for an Industrial Security Program flowing

from the President or the Congress. The Court also strongly indicated that

even with such authority that there was a need for confrontation of witnesses

at such hearings. To meet this, the Administration is discouraging legislation

and approaching the matter through an Executive Order, two draits of which

have been examined by the Department and the Bureau.

The proposed Order

appears impractical in some respects and Yeagley of the Department has advised

us that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General do not like the Order as

drafted, particularly the "special counsel" concept and Deputy Attorney General

Walsh is being instructed to "bounce the Order back to the White House." By

letter dated September 30, 1959, to the Attorney Cneral, copies to Walsh and

Yeagley, the Bureau went on record that while we would attempt to live up to

any Order, the Department should carefully consider the position of the Department

and the Bureau under the proposed Order in that we would be forced to turn

down numerous requests to produce informants and sources for testimony or

interview in view of our overriding responsibility to protect their identities in

the interests of national security. This might open the Department and the

Bureau up to criticism that we were not living up to the spirit of the Executive

Order.

From the standpoint of the conference with the Attorney General on

October 6, we think the Bureau's position should be that the Industrial Security Pro-

gram problem should be settled either through Executive Order or legislation;

НН 55176 DooId:32989646 Page 497

---

## Page 498

Domestic Intelligence Division

that whichever means is used must be practical and not merely drawn up in

a visionary manner in an attempt to satisfy the Supreme Court but end up

by placing the investigative agencies in an untenable position because they.

cannot comply with the spirit of the Order.

(2) Port Security Program - There has been no change in the Port Security

Program with the exception that Treasury Department has drafted proposed

legislation to enable the Coast Guard to subpoena and pay the travel expenses of

witnesses to appear at Coast Guard hearings.

Treasury has indicated this

bill is in the Bureau of the Budget. At the March 12, 1959, conference the

Director pointed out that positive action should be taken toward getting such

legislation and the confrontation issue should not be used as an excuse to scrap

the program because the FBI had supplied a substantial number of witnesses

who could appear and testify. The Bureau's position should be the same;

namely, that the wherewithal should be devised to carry forth the program instead

of scrapping it. It should be borne in mind that in Port Security hearings as

in many other security-type hearings the question of confrontation will continue

to be an issue and the pattern set by the Executive Order in the Industrial

Security Program will probably be applied to the other types of security hearings.

(3) Air Crewmen Screening Program - The Air Crewmen Screening

Program is a program proposed by ICIS to screen crews of United States planes

engaged in international flights and to screen all holders of Airmen's Certificates.

The ICIS also proposed the Federal Communications Commission Radio Screening

Program which would require the screening of all operators of radio transmitters.

To our knowledge, nothing has been done on either of these programs since the

March, 1959, conference with the Attorney General. While the FBI originally

concurred that these programs would be helpful, we have not pushed them,

believing this is a proper function of ICIS. It is believed the Bureau's position

should be that a decision should be reached as to whether these programs should

be implemented and they should not be allowed to hang fire on the basis that

they might not be agreeable or acceptable to the Supreme Court. In other words,

security programs should not be left in a status of hiatus because of pending

judicial decisions.

(4) Personnel Security Program - The March, 1959 conference discussed

the Personnel Security Program, particularly whether there should be legislation

to provide for an over-all security program which would cover both sensitive

-8-

55176 DocId: 32989646 Page 498

---

## Page 499

Domestic Intelligence Division

and nonsensitive areas. This is still an undecided issue although several bills

have been introduced into Congress to remove the distinction between sensitive

and nonsensitive areas of Federal employment. Undoubtedly, the Greene

decision in the Supreme Court carrying the strong inference that confrontation

is necessary in security-type hearings has slowed up consideration of legislation

in this field by the Department. This is essentially a Departmental problem

and we feel the Bureau's position again should be that the Department should

meet these issues rather than coast along in a state of indecision.

(5) In the field of legislation involving security, by letter dated September 2,

1959, the Bureau proposed to Deputy Attorney General Walsh the following items,

which the Director might wish to point out to the Attorney General. While bills

were introduced into Congress on some of these items, legislation has not been

completed as to any of them.

(a) It is desirable that Title 18, Section 791, United States Code, be

amended to extend the jurisdiction of the Federal courts over acts of espionage

against the United States wherever commitied.

(b) Amendment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to clarify

and make more specific the definition of a ''Foreign Principal" and to further

clarify the exemption to registration afforded business representatives.

(c) Legislation is suggested which would permit the Secretary of

State to consider security factors in the granting of passports; however,

appropriate provisions should be made to protect FBI informants and sources

in this connection. This matter is mentioned in the Bureau's memorandum

to Walsh dated May 26, 1959; regarding H. R. 7006.

(d) Another suggestion is legislation to strengthen the Smith Act of

1940 by defining the word "organize" and the word "advocacy." A definition

of "organize" was introduced as H. R. 2369 and as S. 1300. S. 1305 attempts

to define "advocacy. "

(e) -Legislation is needed which would prohibit former Government

employees from disclosing to unauthorized individuals certain information

obtained by them in the course of their employment.

(f) Legislation is needed to amend the espionage laws so as to

provide punishment for persons who gather and correlate data from legitimate

sources for transmittal to foreign governments.

Domestic Intelligence Division

(6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice,

as well as Government departments in general, to shy away from pursuing

• logical courses of action in the security field rather than to implement necessary

security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate

decisions by the supreme Court. The net effect of this is that the Supreme

Court is not required to meet these issues and render decisions and thus,

historically, to take responsibility for them. It is our feeling it is a far better

course of action to attempt to implement those programs necessary for our

national security and give ground grudgingly and only where forced to do so

so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to

carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner.

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES;

JOSEPH ABRAMS

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General

on 12/31/59. It relates to the association between John George

Ledes,

a former legal advisor to Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC) Commissioner James E. Sargent, and Joseph

Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files here and in

New York and have interviewed numerous persons in and out of

SEC who handledcases involving Abrams' firms.

We determined

that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters

while Ledes was still with that agency. We are now engaged

in interviewing additional persons with possible pertinent

knowledge of the association and in the detailed job of tracing

Ledes' financial transactions through bank, realty and other

records to pin down specifics of loans irom Abrams to Ledes

relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes. Abrams'

loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus

bring their relationship within the scope of the Conflict of

Interest Statutes.

It is noted we have been told that both Ledes and

• assistant to former Attorney General Brownell.

Russo has not

been alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter.

The case is being given top priority in handling both

in the field and at the Seat of Government.

MELVIN W. SMITH - VICTIM

CIVIL RIGHTS

This is the case concerning which Acting Assistant

Attorney General Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr., Civil Rights Division,

made a press release on 1/14/60 stating that the IBI has been

requested to investigate this matter.

By memorandum 1/14/60, Mr. Ryan requested a preliminary

investigation based upon a news

article in the "Washington Post

and Times Herald," 1/12/60, and an editorial in the same paper,

1/13/60, regarding an incident in Montgomery County Peoples Court

wherein one Gordon L. Contee became violent when convicted of

rape.

He was subdued by officers but Melvin Smith, Contee's

19-year-old half brother, rushed forward from the audience and

struck frank Griggs, an officer who

was subduing Contee. It was

alleged that Smith was beaten by the officers while being taken

to jail after his assault on Griggs.

Colonel James S. McAulitte, superintendent, Hontgomery

County Police, Melvin L.

Reese,

Montgomery County Manager, and

Luke Bennett, sheriff, have all been notified that the Bureau

has undertaken investigation of this matter.

Pertinent court records were not available over the

week end but will be reviewed l/18/60. The Montgomery County

Police Department reports have not yet been made available, but

State's Attorney Leonard I. Kardy is meeting with County Manager

Reese and County Police Superintendent McAuliffe 118.60 to discuss

making these records available.

Subjects' attorneys have advised them to make no

statement except in attorneys' presence.

Subjects Griggs, Bechtel

and Davries have advised they are represented by Barnard T.

Welsh and will confer with him to determine whether they should

furnish statements.

The victim has been intervieved and admits striking

subject Griggs in the eye while in court and then running from

the courtroom.

Ile was caught in the hall and while being taken

up a narrow stairway by Devries and an unknown officer, they

met subjects Griggs, Offutt and Bechtel. Griggs,

who had a

night stick, allegedly said, "That's the one who hit me in the

nose."

As the victim passed Griggs, he was hit on the head with

a hard object but did not see who hit him.

As he turned around,

Griggs hit him on the head with the night stick.

Offutt then hit

him with his fist

above the left eye and Bechtel kicked him on the

leg. Devries hit him on the back with his fist. The victim was not

"Luce," which is also being constructed

at Quincy, Massachusetts.

This damage was not reported to us or to

the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-60 as the damage was

originally considered probably inadvertent. In view of the other

two cases involving cut. cables, the Boston Office has opened an

investigation on this matter also.

The type of damage involved or the lack of any attempt to

hide or aisguise the damage may be indicative of employees attempting

to create more work or of disgruntled Navy personnel.

The Boston

BERNARD J. GOLDFINE

Although we are not involved in the Goldfine matter,

I this case is currently the subject of a great deal of discussion

between the lax Division and the treasury department.

The Goldfine

tax fraud investigation, according to

our treasury sources, is scheduled to go before grand jury in

Boston next month. Goldfine and his nine New England componies

owe the Government approximately eight

million dollars. This,

of course, includes interest, b; delinquency penalties, 25%;

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

Following the supreme Court decision in the Greene

case: on June 29, 1959, prolonged efforts to prepare a

Presidential Directive to establish a program under which

private contractors may be granted access to classified data

have culminated in a draft order dated January 7, 1960.

Budget is circulating this draft to all interested agencies.

The more recent Bureau comments concerning this matter were

forwarded by memorandum to AAG leagley, December 30, 1959;

by memorandum to the Attorney General,

messrs. walsh and leagley, January o,

January Ils 1960, to hir. leagley; and by memorandum oj

January 14, 1960, to Assistant Attorney General Kramer, with

copy to ur. Yeagley. The last two of these communications

both concerned the same draft which is now being circulated

by Budget.

In brief, we have noted that under the proposed Order

agencies may consider all of the pertinent information available

regardless of source. Under section 1 A 1 protection is

afforded to regular confidential informants.

Under Section 4 A 2

information from persons other than current

informants may be

considered if they cannot appear due to death, severe illness,

or some such other good and sufficient cause.

It is apparent

that information from casual informants who refuse to testify

cannot be used under this section.

section 5 B, according to Mr. leagley, would allow

use of data from wire

taps, microphones, and other sensitive

techniques.

Mr. Yeagley has indicated,

however, that such

data would have to be produced in the form of actual quotations

from the conversations rather than the paraphrased form in

which we disseminate this information.

Hes believe it will not

be possible for us to furnish other than paraphrased information

in most instances because of the absolute necessity of protecting

our sources.

• Even though data from casual informants and sensitive

techniques may not be used as indicated above, section 9 of the

Order grants and affirms the department head

concerned authority

62-77133

HH 55176 DooId:32989646 Page 512

---

## Page 513

to exercise control over the Nation's military and defense

secrets and nothing in the rest of the order is deemed to

limit or affect his responsibility and powers in this regard.

Use of such authority and power will permit the department

head to ast in those instances in which derogatory data is

available but cannot be utilized under the procedures established

in the balance of the order.

We have obserued to the department

that it has undoubtedly considered the public reaction should it

turn out that it is necessary to use this summary power in a

majority of cases.

We have several times reiterated that FBI wi1l

respect the confidence placed in it by both regular informants

or other persons and will not disclose their identity without

their specific permission.

He have summarized by stating

that from our standpoints

the order as drafted, will permit

us to furnish all auailable data to appropriate agencies as in

the past and provides appropriate protection for our confidential

informants.

Data from any casual informants and from highly

sensitive techniques will largely be usable only under section e.

We have stated that the Bureau' does not object to the proposed

order from an operational standpoint.

On January 14, John Doherty of the department informed

us of a very

minor addition, proposed by Philip Areeda of the

White House, which was discussed in memorandum of January 15.

This addition would not affect the comments we have previously

made concerning this order.

PROTECTING IDENTITY OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS

CONFRONTATION ISSUE

The supreme.

court is scheduled to hear arguments on two

cases involving hearings and the right of confrontation on

January lô, 1960. The cases involve Hannon us. Larche and

Hannah us. Slawson. Solicitor General Rankin will argue the cases

for the Government.

The cases involve the president's civil Rights Commission

which was established by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1957

to investigate charges of citizens being discriminatorily deprived

of the right to vote.

The question raised for the supreme Court

is whether the civil Rights Act of 195? authorizes the Civil Rights

commission to conduct hearings wherein state registrars and

private citizens accused of depriving others of the right to vote

are denied notice of charges against them and confrontation.

Although the hearings held by the civil Rights

Commission are investigative rather than judicial of puritive

such as the normal Government hearing, the argument and the

supreme court decision in these cases could shed some light

on the issue of confrontation as

well as the investigative agency's

right to protect the identity of confidential informants. This

is particularly true in view of the current negotiations

produce an executave order in relation to the Industrial security

program.

These are the two cases which the "lashington Post"

commented upon editorially on December 14, 1959, supporting the

civil Rights Commission's hearing procedures in

that it was

necessary that the commission protect their confidential informants

from reprisals by segregationists.

SEIZURE POWERS IN NEUTRALITY CASES

The Department for about a year has been

negotiating to obtain for us seizure powers under litle 22,

Section 401, United States Code, which would enable us to

seize arms,

munitions of war and other articles about

to be exported in violation of law and follow through

to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality

cases.

This was to be accomplished through the issuance

of an

Executive Order conferring on the Attorney General

powers to seize under this statute which in turn would

be delegated to the tBl by the attorney teneral.

On November 19, 1959, the Attorney General

advised that the Treasury Department had agreed to the

proposed executive Urder.

The Department advised on

December 23, 1959, that the proposed executive Urder

• had been sent by the Attorney General to the Fresident

through the director of the Bureau of the Budget for

approval by letter dated December 16, 1959.

On January 15, 1960, pursuant to our inquiry

concerning the current status of this matter, Assistant

Attorney General Walter Yeagley advised that

the proposed

Executive Order is presently in the Bureau of the Budget

which has sent it to certain agencies for comment.

Yeagley advised

that the Bureau of the Budget had

heard

from the Treasury Department but had not received replies

from the Office of Civil and Defense Mabilization,

Department of

Defense and the State Department.

He advised that he

could not understand why the Office of Civil and Defense

Mobilization or the Department of Defense would have any

comment on this and stated he was going to check with

Nr. Levy at the Bureau of the Budget who is handling

this matter in an effort to have it expedited.

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES;

JOSEPH ABRAMS

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General

on 12-31-59. It relates to the association between Ledes,

former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Commissioner James C. Sargent and Abrams, a New York promoter of

unsavory reputation.

Ledes resigned from Reynolds and Company,

Now York brokers, on 1-28-60.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files throughout

the country and have interviewed numerous

persons in and out

of SEC who handled cases involving Abrams: firms. He determinec

that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters

while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams made loans to

Ledes relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes.

These

loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and

thus

bring their relationship within the scope of Conflict of Interest

Statutes.

SEC Commissioner Sargent, who originally denied knowledge

as to any connection between Ledes

and Abrams, has since improved

his memory considerably and now feels he may have been taken

advantage of by Ledes.

Sargent finally furnished a signed state-

ment as to his recollection of these matters on 2-5-60.

Sargent

told us that Ledes had been in touch with Tony Russo who had

arranged for former Attorney General Brownell to talk to attornes

teneral Rogers in July, 1950, about Sargent's ambitionat the time

to become U.S. Attorney for

the southern District of New York.

We have been told that both Ledes and Abrams were associated with

Russo, ex-confidential assistant to Brownell.

Russo has not been

alleged to be involved in any irregularities

in this matter.

Arrangements are now being made to interview subject

Ledes in New York City. Arrangements are also being made to

interview subject Abrams who is serving & 30-month sentence on

Fraud Against the Government charges,

Charles Gordon. These interviews, and subsequent record checks

to verify information furnished by the subjects, will complete

the investigation.

DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS AT WOODNER HOTEL

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

Hucks, chief telephone operator at the Woodner

Hotel, was indicted December 2, 1959; along with her

assistant, Davis, for having obstructed justice by

destroying records of the Woodner Hotel (telephone toll'

tickets concerning calls to and from Teamster officials)

which had been subpoenaed by the McClellan Committee.

The grand jury here in the District, which was hearing

this case, has been recessed for several days and it is

not expected to resume hearings until later this month.

Upon resumption of the hearings, it is expected that

additional testimony will be taken from co-defendaat Davis,

who appeared briefly at her own request before the grand

jury during the week beginning February 1, 1960.

The additional hearings are aimed at developing

further information showing that subject Hucks committed

perjury before the McClellan Committee in denying ownership

of a fur stole we located in Falls Church, Virginia.

This

stole allegedly was received by Hucks from James Hoffa

and/or the Teamsters Union.

lampa, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana.

Only ten of the

victims were identified and the other bodies have not been

recovered.

On January 17, 1960, we initiated a full-scale

investigation in this matter.

It had

been alleged

that

Dr. Robert V. spears, an ex-convict with a long criminal • •

record who had been reported as a passenger on the plane, had

induced his friend

anc!

Florida, to board the plane in his place.

Taylor of Tampa $100,000 worth of insurance with his vife

Spears had over

as

beneticiary and Taylor purchased wor, 50u worth or flight

insurance just prior to the trip with his son as beneficiary.

From the first, our investigation was

directed at

finding Spears or Taylor since this appeared to be a key point

in our investigation.

Spears was located by Bureau Agents in

hoenix, Arizona, on January 20, 1960, and charged with the

Interstate Transportation of a Stolen

Motor Vehicle (ITSV).

Spears admitted Taylor took his place on the ill-fated plane

and that following the crash he, Spears, tried to conceal his

identity. He took Taylor's car, with his

alleged permission,

but admitted he had no authority to take it to Arizona and

that he and his friend, Dr. William Turska, removed the

identification number from it and tried to

get a fraudulent

title for the car.

„Spears, with Turska, contacted Mrs. Spears

in Dallas, Texas,

about January 7, 1960, and Mrs. Spears

admitted that her husband persuaded her not. to reveal the

fact that he was alive so that the insurance policies could

be paid to her as beneficiary.

On January 20, 1960, when Spears was arrested in

Fhoenix,

Arizona,

he was charged with the Interstate Transportation

I a stolen Motor Vehicle for taking Taylor's car from Florida to

Arizona.

He was taken to the U.ü.

commissioner in thoenix or

that date and held on 505,00e bond.

on february 1. 1900, Spears

was brought before the J.s. District Judge in Phoenix and

charged by information with the interstate transportaion of Taylor's automobile.

Spears waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty.. His bond was continued

at $35, 000, and February 15, 1960, was set as the date for sentencing.

Physical evidence from the crash is extremely sparse. Since the

examination of the limited physical material found did not indicate an

explosion or the reason for the crash, it was hoped that the plane could

be located in the Gulf. If the plane could be found and examined, it might

reveal some definite physical evidence of the cause of the crash, particularly

if a bomb was involved. On January 28, 1960, salvage operations were begun.

by the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico after sonar contact had located an object

which was thought to be the plane. On February 5, 1960, however, the Navy

discontinued salvage operations without locating the downed aircraft.

Following an interview with an abortionist in Dallas, Texas, who

formerly associated with Dr. Spears, the Miami Office advanced the theory

that Spears might have been in Tampa on November 13 to 15, 1959, for

the purpose of preparing an abortion formula through a process which involves

the cooking of dynamite to obtain nitroglycerin, and that Spears might have

prevailed on Taylor to transport the formula to Dallas by plane in Spears'

place. The explosion, if there was one, might have resulted from an

accidental explosion of the abortion formula. The Laboratory has considered

this theory and has advised that it knows of no instance of the use of

nitroglycerin in preparations utilized to produce abortions. In addition,

during a reinterview with the Dallas abortionist, he advised that all of

the ingredients used by Spears in his abortion formula were stable and not

volatile or explosive.

All persons contacted in this investigation have denied any knowledge

of the wilful destruction of the plane. Nevertheless our investigation is being

pressed to determine full facts and to uncover any violations of Federal laws

which might have occurred. The United States Attorney at Phoenix has been

kept fully advised and has under consideration the question of whether a

• prosecutable Federal case for mail fraud exists against Dr. spears, his wife

and/or Dr. Turska.

As of February 8, 1960, twenty-five investigative reports in this case

have been made available to the Department and to the Civil Aeronautics Board.

at Boliura, North Carolina, killing all 34 occupants.

The body of one

passenger, Julian Andrew Frank, was found about 20 miles "rom the crash

scene. Frank, a New fork attorney, carried insurance of $997,500

and was reportedly engaged in fraudulent activities.

of available parts of the plane reassembled in a

Investigation at the sene of the crash up contrailer

conducted dy Civil Aeronautics Board investigators. They have been

unable to reach a definite conclusion as to the cause of the crash.

Frank's body, which was found near Kure Beach, Norh Carolina,

bore only remnants of clothing.

The body was mangled and the lower

portion of the left arm and of both legs were missing. His luggage,

which reportedly consisted of a zipper-type blue flighi bag and a

brown leather atiache case, has not been located.

IBI Laboratory examination of Frank's right hand and part

Of his right arm, foreign material removed from his hand and arm and

portions of clothing found on his body revealed no explosive residue.

Pathologists who examined Frank's body have advised that his body

nad the appearance of hauing been subjected to a severe force of unusual

nature and they believe his injuries resembled blast damage but they

cannot dejiniüely identify them as such.

According to the pathologists,

similar wounds have jeen observed on victims of land mine explosions.

IbI Laboratory examination of a life jacket jound at Kure Beach

on January as, 1980, disclosed some nitrate present in a dirty smeared

deposit in an ared of the jacket in which were imbedded metal fragments

from a sipper and pieces of blue maïerial. Numerous small blue fragments

"rom the lije jacket and from unidentified clothing found at the crash

scene were determined to de similar and appear to correspona to the

material which composes blue flight bags sold oy various airlines.

These findings are consistent with what would be expected as a result

of a detonatión of a high-order type of explosive.

These jindings

are not conclusive and additional maierial from the scene of the crash

will be examined as received by the FBI Laboratory in an efjort to

reach a definite conclusion.

Extensive investigation of the activities of Frank has failed

to develop any direct evidence to date that he was responsible for

the crash.

The investigation of his activities and of the

activities

of his associaies is continuing. Thirty-two inuestigative reports have

been disseminated to the department and to the civil eronautios Board.

21 cut wires were found in the fire control

wiring of the guided missile frigate "Luce"

, which is also under

construction a quincy,.

L'his damage was not reported

to us or to the office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-50 as the

damage was originally considered inadvertent. Over 11, 000 employees

had access to the vessel.

The employees assigned to the area of the

danage have been identified and are being interuiewed.

Other employees

knowr to have worked in the area are also being interviewed.

The

damaged wires have been forwarded to the IBI Laboratory for examination.

In connection with the danage on the "Long Beach" and "Luce"

superrisory employees have expressed the opinion that this damage is

of the nuisance and malicious mischief type rather than sabotage as the

damage was not hidden and was

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

On February 2, 1960, the House passed H.R. 8121,

introduced by Mr. Walter, which would authorize the secretary

of Defense to establish a program for screening employees

of private contractors for access to classified information.

The bill states that procedures prescribed by Defense shall

be designed to protect from disclosure all information which,

in the opinion of the secretary of Defense, would affect the

national security, safety, or public interest or would tend

to compromise investigative sources or investigative methods.

The bill has been referred to the senate Committee on the

Judiciary and, if passed, would permit Defense to reinstitute

the same program which was in effect at the time of the

Supreme Court decision in the Greene Casé.. Defense could,

however, institute a new program offering a maximum of con-

frontation while protecting sources or techniques in accordance

with the terms of the bill.

On february 5, 1960, Assistant Attorney General Yeagley

forwarded a new draft of the proposed Executive Order in this

matter and stated it was the result of meetings with the. Attorney

General and the White House and that he hoped that it would

be the final draft. this draft introduced four major changes:

The first of these would permit use of information

from a so-called "casual" informant without confrontation if the

informant could not appear due to death, sèvere illness, or

some other cause determined bu the head of the depariment te

be good and sufficient.

The underlined words have been added

and would considerably broaden the circumstances under which

information from such a source might be used.

A second change, however, would require that when

an exception to confrontation was granted in the case of death

or severe illness, as indicated above,

the identity of the

source be disclosed to the applicant.

This requirement would

apply only in the case of death or severe illness and would not

apply to the new exception discussed in the previous paragraph.

We have repeatedly told the Department that we must respect the

1../75

WH 55176 DocId:32989646 Page.

## Page 529

confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us information

and that we will not disclose their identities without their

permission.

In the case of death of severe illness, we will

be unable to secure that permission and we do not understand

why this requirement has been added.

A third change makes it possible for either the

• that an indiviaval

is a current confidential informant and that his disclosure

would be detrimental to the national security. The previous

draft required that this certification be made. by the Attorney

General and we consider this preferable. If the head of the

investigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data

and, at the same time, to decide whether the applicant is to

have an opportunity to confront the source of that data, this

procedure may be criticized both by the public and the

courts.

This matter was discussed with the department by Mr. Belmont

at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General's Office on

August 31, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a logical

standpoint and the standpoint of the supreme court, •

certification concerning the need to protect an informant's

identity should be made by the Attorney General in the case

of the fBI or the appropriate department head in the case of

other investigative agencies.

The fourth change clarifies the authority of the

department head to deny or revoke access to classified data

without regard to the balance of the order. Although the

previous draft granted this authority, the new language is an

improvement as it removes all possible doubt as to its meaning.

Our observations concerning the four changes,.as

REQUESY TO REVIEW SOCIAL SECURITY RECORDS IN

AL"LEMPT LO IDENTIFY SOVIET "ILLIGAL" ESPIONAGI AGENTS

'rom our experience gained in cases involving Soviet "illegal"

agents, we know that the soviet intelligence services instruct their

"illegals" to apply for social security cards as a step in establishing

a so-called "legal" identity. Examination of social security applications

filed by several souiet "illegal" agents known to us revealed certain

foreign characteristics, such as style of handwriting and punctuation,

and other items which would be susceptible of identification.

In view of the above, we explored with social security officials

a program involving the screening of social security applications

at its t'ederal repository in saltimore. After some negotiation,

Commissioner Mitchell advised he could not comply with our request.

He felt Social security must protect its records and our proposed

program. opened up social security records on too broad a basis.

By letter 1-18-60 we advised the Attorney General of our

problem and the potential of our proposed program to defect "illegals."

RE:

HOWARD LEWIS RUNDQUIST

WILLIAN J. SHERGALIS, ET AL.

REGISTRATION ACT - CUBA

The case involves U.s. plane piloted by two Americans,

Rundquist and Shergalis, which was shot down March 21, 1960, while

trying to smuggle four cubans out of that country with resulting

arrest of Runaquist and shergalis.

FBI source in Miami advised

March 22, 1960,

that incident was staged by Castro agents to provide

Castro with basis for renewed attacks against U.S. for allowing

illegal flights to Cuba. On March 23, 1960, this hoax was exposed

when shergalis gave statement to U. S. Embassy admitting role as

Castro agent and implicating various cubans in U.S. and Cuba. We

conducted intensive investigation in this matter and developed

substantial evidence showing that Rundquist-shergalis flight was,

in fact, instigated by Castro agents. Miami reports of April 1, April 6,

April 15, and May 6, 1960, covering our investigation, have been

furnished to Department and other interested agencies.

On May 3, 1960, Federal Grand Jury at Miami, which was

convened on April o, 1900, returned indictments against shergalis

and Hector Garcia Soto (Cuban Air Force employee at Miami uno served

as intermediary between Shergalis and cuban intelligence officials)

charging them with violations of Foreign Agents Registration Act of

1938, as amended. Indictments were also returned against shergalis

and hundquist charging violations of federal Auzation Act, administered

by Federal Aviation Agency, for failure to file proper flight plan.

Shergalis is still in custody of Cuban officials in that country,.

Cuban Government having rejected U.S. request that shergalis and

Rundquist be extradited to face charges in this country.

At time

indictments were returned, Garcia was in Cuba and, therefore,

indictments were sealed and bench warrants were issued for arrest

of shergalis and Garcia.

Garcia returned to Miami on afternoon of May 4, 1960, and

was arrested by our Miami Office at Miami International Airport.

Press release was issued SAl, Miami, concerning arrest and subsequently

on same date Department issued press release concerning indictments

of shergalis, Garcio and runaquist..

Arraignment of Garcia was

originally scheduled for May o, 1900, but was postponed. until

20, at request of defense attorney.

Bond for Garcia was set

at $10, 000 and on afternoon of may o,

1960, bond was posted with

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR

MOTOR VEHICLES - FALSE REPORTS

SUMMARY OF PROSECUTIONS

The following is

a summary of the prosecutions

under the false report section of the destruction of Aircrait

or Motor Vehicles Statute.

Attached hereto is a thumbnail sketch of each

(of the cases which are pending prosecution at this time.

Since the U. S. Attorneys', conference early in

April, 1960, prosecution has been authorized in 16 of these

cases. Arrests were made in 15 of these cases and in one

case, the subject Vincent Joseph Micel, Boston, Massachusetts,

was

permitted to surrender following the return of a true

bill of indictment.

The Micel violation actually occurred

on January 26, 1960, and he was arrested by local authorities.

The Assistant U. S. Attorney, Boston, Massachusetts, deferred

his prosecutive opinion pending the outcome of local charges.

When local prosecution was subsequently discontinued, the

case was presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Boston,

Massachusetts, on May 19, 1960.

There are also lour.

cases pending in which

prosecution was authorized prior to April, 1960.

On May 19, 1960, Donald David Kitch, Portland,

Oregon, District Manager for Western Oil Company, who, on

May 12, 1960, made a false report while seeing his boss off

on a United Air Lines flight in Portland, Oregon, entered

a plea of guilty in U. S. District Court. Sentence was not

imposed pending the completion of a presentence investigation

and subject was released on his own recognizance. This

conviction brings the total number of convictions to 17 since

the effective date of this statute, July 14, 1956. These

convictions, with the exception of the Kitch conviction, in

which sentence is not yet imposed, have resulted in 6 years

actual sentences, 10 years probationary sentences and $2,750

in fines.

In summary, it is noted that convictions have been

obtained in 17 cases and prosecution is pending in 19 cases.

adverse effect of the delay on successful prosecution has been

pointed out.

At our specific request the Department instructed

the U. S. Attorney in late

March, 1960, to seek an early trial

date in the matter. By letter April 27, 1960, the Newark' Office

has advised that the U. S. Attorney has

been attempting contact

with Staff's attorney, Congressman Cornelius E. Gallagher,. in

order to arrange a trial date.

RAYMOND JACOS OTTEN,

commented to a passenger aboard a United Air Lines plane which

had just departed from Chicago, Illinois, that "the mad bomber

is aboard," entered a plea of

not guilty

March 1, 1960, and

trial was

scheduled for March 21, 1960.

Otten who is an

has suffered epileptic seizures since his plea was entered and

has been granted two continuances. Assistant U. s. Attorney,

Chicago, Illinois, advised May 17, 1960, that subject had filed

a motion to dismiss and the Government's answer to this motion

is due on May 23, 1960. A hearing on the motion is set for

May 27, 1960, and the trial date for this case is n set for

May 31, 1960.

Trial was

scheduled for April 21, 1960, and on that date his attorney filed

a motion to dismiss the information. On May 19, 1960, the

motion to dismiss the information was denied in

U. S. District

Court, Chicago, Illinois, and the case continued to June 16, 1960.

'PETER WILSON ASKEH, who advised an airlines clerk

at New York City that a passenger aboard an Eastern Airlines plane

VOTER REGISTRATION CASES

UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1960

The Civil Rights Division has requested the

delivery of demand letters to registration officials and

subsequent inspections and copying of voter registration

records in eight counties and parishes in Alabama, Georgia,

| South Carolina and Louisiana.

The desired records were

made available in South Carolina and Georgia.

In Louisiana a suit has been filed in Federal

Court against the Attorney General, Mr. Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr.,

and the Director of the FBI alleging Titles 3 and 6 oi the

Civil Rights Act of 1960 are unconstitutional and requests

an injunction enjoining the Attorney General and the FBI

from proceeding under the Act.

United States District

Judge Ben C. Dawkins, Shreveport, Louisiana, signed an order

on May 25, 1960, directing the Attorney General, Acting

Attorney General Ryan and the Director to show

cause at 9:30 a.m., June 20, 1960, why preliminary inter-

locutory injunction should not be granted. Judge Dawkins also

signed a temporary restraining order to be effective until

June 20, 1960.

In Alabama, in one instance, an injunction has been

issued by Judge James A. Hare of the Fourth Judicial Circuit

which covers Wilcox County, Alabama. This requires clarification

of the Act before granting

permission to inspect and copy

I voter registration recods. The Attorney General, Mr. Ryan,

plus the Special Agent in Charge of the Mobile Office and

the Assistant Special Agent in Charge, are named in the

injunction. No reply has been received to the demand letter

in a second investigation although one has been promised

on June 6, 1960.

UNKNOWN SUBJECT

RICHARD KENNETH KAUFMAN-VICTIM

EXTORTION, 5-26-60

Richard Kaufman, a student at Syracuse University,

New York and son of Federal Judge Irving Kaufman, who

resided during the trial of the Apalachin hoodlums, or

S-1-6U, received an anonymous threatening phone call.

The

unknown caller made reference to victim's father and threatened

"Just wait until we get hold of you."

Kaufman received another

call of a similar nature on 4-4-60 and on 4-5-60 received the

New York.

1960, date.

AUSA Kenneth Ray of the Northern District of New York,

has indicated letters coupled with previous phone calls

constituted a violation of the Federal Ixtortion Statute and

his opinion was concurred in by the Department on April 8, 1960.

Extensive investigation has been conducted by our

Albany Office in an effort to identify and locate the extortion-

ist. To date, no positive information has been obtained, and

no suspects have been developed.

Of interest, however, is the • •

fact that the rumors pervails among fellow students, faculty

members, and advisors of the victim that he prepared the

communications in question. While no direct evidence cor-

roborating these rumors

has been uncovered, writing paper and

envelopes similar to that used in one of the comnunications

found in the victin's room.

The Department has requested copies of all investiga-

tive reports. Judge Kaufman will be confidentially advised of the

facts developed by our investigation, after which the reports will

be disseminated to the Department.

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

CONFLICI OF INTEREST

This case relates to the association between

Lodes, a former legal

adviser to Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC) Commissioner James C. Sargent and Joseph

Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation.

We

completed an extensive investigation which determined that

Lodes endeavored to assist Abrams with several SEC matters

while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams made loans

to Ledes to finance properties which Ledes purchased.

The attorney for subject Abrams advised his client

not to talk to us.

The attorney Ior Ledes, James M. MC Inerney,

refused to make Ledes available for interview unless he,

Me Inerney, is present.

We informed the Department and

suggested

that they

consider calling Ledes before a Federal Grand Jury or

interviewing him themselves in Mc Inerney's presence.

On May 13, 1960, Roger Connor, Executive Assistant to

ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY SUBCOMMITTEE

COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

ESTES KEFAUVER, CHAIRMAN

Recently Senator Kefauver's Committee requested

the Bureau to conduct name checks on 304 individuals

reportedly associated with the boxing industry.

Several

Oi these names were duplicated on a prior request for a

name check by Senator Kefauver's Committee. It appeared

that the Committee might be conducting a fishing expedition

by submitting such an extensive list.. Accordingly, the

matter was referred to the Department to answer the Committee's

request.

On May 25, 1960, William G. Hundley, Chief,

Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section,

Criminal

Division, telephonically advised that following a contact

with the Kefauver Committee on that date the original

request for name checks on 304 individuals had been

reduced to a request for name checks on 30 individuals.

Of these 30, Mr. Hundley pointed out that where any

individual was the subject of pending prosecution, such

as Frankie Carbo, it would be unnecessary for the Bureau

to search its files concerning that individual.

Mr. Hundley

also advised the Committee representatives that it would not

be possible in every instance to make name checks on an

expeditious basis while the hearings were being conducted

inasmuch as the time factor in making the name checks would

depend upon the number of references involved.

Mr. Hundley

is sending a memorandum to the Bureau in the immediate

future listing the names which the Committee has now

requested be checked.

Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley's memorandum listing

the names, the names will be checked and appropriate summaries

prepared.

FBI BUDGET REQUEST - FISCAL YEAR 1968

The Bureau's request for 1968 totals $186,574,000. It will

provide for a personnel staff totaling 15,780 (6,638 agents and 9,142

clerks). The request makes provision for an increase of 569 full-year

employees (106 agents and 463 clerks) when compared to 1967.

Of the additional employees, 165 (100 agents and 65 clerks)

are for assignment to the field to assist in the handling of a heavy

volume of civil rights work. (This is the second increment of a

total increase of 300 agents and attendant clerical staff and

equipment previously ordered by the President for civil rights

work over a three-year period to be implemented at the rate of 100 agents

a year.) The remaining 404 employees (6 agents and 398 clerks) are for

assignment at our headquarters, the bulk to be utilized to handle the

tremendous increase in name and fingerprint checks being received.

The request of $186,574,000 for 1968 is an increase of

$4,249,000 when compared to the total requirements for the current

fiscal

year 1967 which includes $175,465,000 already appropriated

and by a supplemental request totaling $6,860,000 brought about

by costs growing out of new legislation increasing our payroll

costs ($5,250,000) and by new legislation increasing the costs we

must pay to transfer employees to meet the needs of the service

($1,610,000) .

Most careful consideration was given to our request for

additional personnel in 1968.

We are absorbing much work and will

endeavor to make further absorptions. When confronted with a

one-million increase in fingerprint receipts, a 43% increase in

name checks, a heavy amount of civil rights and other work, we

have no alternative but to ask for additional manpower if we are to

meet our responsibilities in these areas. .

The Bureau's growing.work is not limited to these particular

areas by any means. The work of the FBI Laboratory mounted to a new

all-time peak during the fiscal year 1966, numerous criminal classifi-

cations reached new highs, and our work in matters vital to the internal

security of the country has continued to increase. We are going to

do our best to handle the mounting work in these areas with our

existing staff. In addition, new items of legislation continue to be

passed adding to our work.

Indicative of our heavy volume of work is the fact that as

of January 1, 1967, pending investigative matters throughout the

field totaled 150,189, with 5% in a delinquent status. At that time,

the average individual assignment in the field was nearly 26 matters as

compared with 20 at that time in 1961.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE AND ORGANIZED CRIME SECTION

During the past few months the Department has

launched into a program of review of past, current, and

contemplated prosecutions to determine if

such cases have

been materially affected by the use of electronic listening

devices. This has required the establishment of special

microphone indices at Bureau Headquarters and voluminous

correspondence with various field divisions to determine if

individuals listed in the Department's inquiries were covered

by FBI microphones. With regard to listed individuals on

whom we have had some form of microphone coverage, we are so

advising the Department and pertinent logs, together in

some cases with other supporting material, are being obtained

from the field for review by Departmental attorneys.

The Department made public the fact that such a

review was under way in the filing of a memorandum with the

Supreme Court by the Solicitor General in the Joseph Schipani

case, November 30, 1966.

Set forth as follows are the brief circumstances

regarding individual prosecutive situations in which, to

date, the Department has made disclosures to various courts

regarding the FBI's use of electronic listening devices of

pertinence to those prosecutions.

Joseph Frank Schipani

Schipani is a New York hoodlum and a member of

La Cosa Nostra who was convicted and sentenced to three years

imprisonment and fined $12,500 for violation of the income tax

laws for the years 1956 through 1960.

Department's request, they were provided with logs reporting

instances where Schipani was covered by an

surveillance.

This electronic surveillance was not directly

Nostra racket figures. On November 30, 1966, the Solicitor

General requested the

Supreme Court to vacate the judgment

regarding Schipani of the Court of Appeals and remand the

case to the District Court for a new trial. On December 12,

1966, the Supreme Court complied with the request of the

Solicitor General. This was installed under the general

authority of the Attorney General, as were ald oi the

following unless otherwise specified.

Louis . Taglianetti

The Department on December 27, 1966, filed a motion

to remand in the United States Court of

Appeals for the First

Circuit in the Louis J. Taglianetti appeal from the judgment

of the United States District Court for the District of

Rhode Island. Taglianetti, a member of the Raymond Patriarca •

"family" of La Cosa

Nostra, was indicted on February 26, 1963,

for income tax evasion for

the years 1956, 1957, and 1958.

He was found guilty on September 16, 1966. Taglianetti

appealed but no brief had yet been filed.

The Department's motion indicated Taglianetti's

conversations had been monitored by microphone surveillance

at the place of business of a close associate (Raymond Patriarca)

where Taglianetti andothers met and that this establishment

was being utilized for purposes connected with organized crime.

On various occasions between March, 1962, when this microphone

was installed with trespass under general

authority of the

Attorney General, until 1965, Taglianetti's conversations

related to his income tax indictment. None of the information

was used in evidence or was the source of leads to any evidence

in the case.

The Department's motion noted that Taglianetti!s

case was within the

ambit of the Supreme Court's decision in

the Black case, decided November 7, 1966. The distinguishing

feature between the two is the intrusion upon attorney-client

conversations

in the Black case, for which the Supreme Court

vacated the conviction and granted a new trial. The Department's

reasons for the motion to remand in Taglianetti was for the

limited purpose of enabling the District Court to examine the

facts and to determine whether Taglianetti's conviction should

stand

or a new trial be ordered.

The defense has now filed a motion for new trial

claiming that, "The Government, having tasted the forbidder

fruit of its illegal bugging and having withheld all knowledge

thereof from the defendant, his counsel and the trial judge,

cannot now preserve the conviction thus obtained because such

forbidden fruit failed to produce a sweet taste." Hearings

on these motions have not yet been scheduled.

FRANK DE NIRO, JR.

MICHAEL DE NIRO

LOUIS DE NIRO

The De Niro brothers were convicted 8/23/65 of

conspiring to defraud the U. S. in evading estate taxes.

They have appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals

for the

Sixth Circuit.

The Cleveland Office conducted

microphone

surveillance from 2/19/64 to 6/16/64 in the office of the

National Cigarette Service, Youngstown, Ohio, a vending

machine company, operated by the de Niros.

In response to the

Department's request 10/14/66 we disclosed the circumstances

of this surveillance to them by letter 10/18/66, and made

available for review the surveillance logs. No information

from this source was disseminated outside the Bureau.

The Department subsequently disclosed to the

Court of Appeals by memorandum the existance of our

microphone surveillance.

Considerable reluctance was

displayed by the Department to including in this

memorandum our general authority for installation of

electronic surveillances.

They did not clearly record the

dates concerning the manner in which the Department requested

and was advised of our coverage.

Our protests were clearly

outlined in correspondence to the Department before this

memorandum was filed. Ultimately our authority was recorded

as a footnote.

This microphone was installed under the

general authority of the Attorney General.

Frank Peter Balistrieri

Balistrieri, the "boss" of Milwaukee's La Cosa

Nostra "family," and

as such the

leader of organized crime

in that area, was brought to trial in United States District

court, Springlield, tlinois, during October, 1966, on

the basis of an Indictment

charging evasion of Federal

income taxes.

An early issue in this action was our

microphone coverage of Balistrieri and certain of his

associates.

Microphone coverage had been established on

Balistrieri's office, in an apartment maintained by his

paramour, and in the office of noodlum attorney Dominic frinzi,

all in Milwaukee, for various periods between 1961 and 1965.

These installations were all made in line with general

departmental authorization as outlined in the Department's

memorandum filed with the Supreme Court in the Black

case.

The defense has made a motion to suppress, based

on this electronic coverage. After hearing testimony

regarding these installations, including testimony of

Bureau personnel, and reviewing logs of the coverage in

question, the judge instructed that the trial should be

commenced, with the defense having the right to renew its

mortion after the trial, in the event evidence presented

warrants such a proceedings.

Trial was undertaken on 10/17/66. On 11/29/66

Defense Attorney Walsh suffered a heart attack and further

trial proceedings have been deferred until March 1, 1967.

None of the information produced by this microphone was

utilized in obtaining the indictment.of Balistrieri.

JFK Act 6 (4)

JEK Act 6 (4)

was convicted 6/21/65 for violation of

wagering tax laws and has appealed to the U. S. Court of

Appeals, Sixth Circuit. The Cleveland Office conducted a

microphone surveillance at the Modern News Center and

Novelties Company, Youngstown, from 1/22/62 until 3/22/62.

JEK Act 6 (4) and his brothers operated a gambling game at this

Location.

Activities covered by this surveillance included

gambling with numerous participants.

The voices of the

individuals covered were never identified. It could not be

determined if the appellant was or was not present during

the operation of this source.

In response to the Department's inquiry, we

disclosed to them by letter dated 11/1/66 the circumstances

of this surveillance and made available for review all

surveillance logs.

By letter dated 1/9/67, the Department

indicated its intention

to disclose

this microphone

surveillance by memorandum to the U. S. Court of Appeals,

Sixth Circuit. In three

letters we

have advised the Department

of the brief operation of this source and that the individuals

covered were never identified.

The Department's proposed

memorandum to the court notes,

"There is a substantial

question whether any conversations in which appellant

participated were even monitored."

In spite of

this, the

Department apparently feels it must disclose this surveillance.

The Department failed to include our general authorization for

installation of electronic surveillances over our protests.

We feel that at the very least the general authorization of the

Department should be in all briefs going to courts so there can

be no accusation that the Bureau was operating in an uncontrolled

and unrestrained manner.

Jack T. Rainwater

Jack T. Rainwater has conducted a large-scale

numbers operation in the Miami, Florida area.

He and six

associates were convicted of state gambling violations in

Florida courts based upon evidence furnished by the

Internal Revenue Service and testimony of Internal Revenue

Service agents.

In response to the Department's request they

were provided with logs reporting those instances where

Rainwater and one of his associates who also was convicted

in state court, were monitored by an electronic surveillance.

Neither of these individuals were the direct subject of an

electronic surveillance.

On January 11, 1967, the Solicitor General

disclosed to the Supreme Court that an electronic device

had been utilized by Federal agents in the Rainwater matter.

Our installation in this matter was made under

general authority of the Attorney General. Information from

this source was disseminated to Internal Revenue Service who

in turn disseminated to local authorities.

in an effortrto force a Tucson

firm to utilize his vending machires. Following the granting

of several continuances the trial judge in Federal District

Court ordered Battaglia to appear for trial on the morning •

of January 11, 1967,

The Department advised that they intended

to inform

the juage that Battaglia had been covered by microphone

surveillances, but that the coverage had no bearing on the

evidence to be produced in substantiation of the criminal

charges against Battaglia. The Department further advised

they were going to recommend that the judge proceed with

the trial and at the conclusion thereof, if the judge feels

it necessary, a hearing will be held to determine the validity

of the Department's claim regarding the microphone evidence.

A hearing on this motion is scheduled for Monday,

January 16, 1967, in Tucson, Arizona.

Edward I. Levinson, et. al., Civil Suit

one of the owners of the

against four Bureau Agents, charging invasion of privacy

asking injunctive relief against further invasion by use of

electronic listening devices. Levinson filed a similar suit

against the Central Telephone Company of Las Vegas and certain

of its employees.

The case

has recently been taken over personally by

Assistant Attorney General Barefoot Sanders who is presently

reviewing all of the material in connection with preparing

a response to plaintiff's motions. No date has been set for

trial in matter. The Bureau has been pressing the Department

to take depositions in this case from such major hoodlums as

Meyer Lansky and Gerardo Catena who have hidden interests in

the Fremont Hotel.

Exed B. Black, Jr.

Fred B. Black, Jr., named as being hired by front

men in Las Vegas to represent their interests in Washington,

D. Co, where Black was alleged to have influence, was convicted

on way 5, 1965, of evading income taxes for the period of

1956 through 1959.

After a number of appeads he petitioned the

Supreme Court for issuance

of a writ of certiorari which was

denied on May 4, 1966.

On May 24, 1966, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall

filed a memorandum with the Supreme Court reporting à listening

device hadbeen placed in Black's hotel suite in 1963, but

HH 55176 DooId:32989646 Page 559

## Page 560

none of the evidence used in Black's trial was obtained as

a result of the listening device.

The Supreme Court on

June 13, 1966, ordered a response by the Department to

questions raised by the Court with regard to the initial

memorandum filed by the Department which was answered on

July 13, 1966, by supplemental memorandum.

This memorandum indicated the listening device,

installed with trespass under general Departmental authori-

zation had monitored conversations of Black and his attorney.

The United States Supreme Court on November

• 7,

1966, vacated the income tax conviction and granted a new

trial, which will not be

set until

after the Robert Baker trial.

/ 69

To date, the Bureau

has received over 1,000 names

of individuals of prosecutive interest for a determination

if such subjects have been covered by FBI microphones.

number of problems have resulted.

One problem which has been encountered, and

which can be expected to be even more serious in

the future,

is the lack of identifying data accompanying the names of

individuals on whom the Department has made inquiry in these

matters.

for example, one list recently received included

475 names, in some cases with a minimum of identifying data

and in others with no identifying data at all. In order that

an accurate determination can be made whether an individual

in question has, in fact, been covered by one of our microphones,

it will be necessary that the Department provide adequate

identifying data when submitting these names for review.

НЯ 35176 DOcId: 32989646

## Page 561

An attendant problem has arisen in certain

inquiries in which the Department has made unreasonable

requests for such reviews on extremely short notice. One of

these involved a request for the results of the review later

the same day it was received. Thoroughness and accuracy, of

absolute necessity in this type review, make extremely rapid

checks such as this in most cases impossible, and at best,

a very dangerous procedure.

With regard to those situations in which the

Department has made disclosures to the various courts,

continuing reluctance has been evidenced on their part to

inform the court of the fact that the installation in question

has been utilized by the FBI under either specific authority

from the Attorney General, or under the general Departmental

authority which was granted.

The Department has been repeatedly

reminded of their reluctance in these individual situations.

the volume involved in this project has caused

a decided strain on the Bureau in processing these numerous

inquiries to date, and these problems become magnified when

the enormity of the entire project is assessed, in view of

indications by the Department that the full review may

encompass as many as 30,000 names.

FUGITIVE SECTION

Cassius Marcellus Clay

Cassius Clay, world's heavyweight boxing

champion and Black Muslim, earlier this year filed a

claim as a conscientious objector and more recently has

applied to his draft board at Louisville, Kentucky, Ior

a ministerial deferment as a minister of the Black Muslim

religion.

After a very extensive investigation by the

Bureau, Clay's draft board denied his claim as a

conscientious objector and placed him in a 1-A classification.

Since

the board's vote was

unanimous, he has no further

appeal as a conscientious objector.

His ministerial

deferment request will now have to be considered by his

local board which our sources indicate will meet in the

next few days. If the local board denies this request,

Clay has the right to appeal.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be used

in preventing communists from gaining control in that country.

We set up a staff of ten Agents.

In August, 1966, at White

House instructions we established a permanent Legal Attache

office there, staffed with three Agents.

The six-month-old government under Joaquin Balaguer

has brought about a degree of stability. Nevertheless, there

continue to be strong undercurrents of dissension. The

rightists reportedly have considered plots to remove Balaguer.

Juan Bosch's political party, loser in the June, 1966, election,.

has been most vocal in its opposition to Balaguer's programs.

The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension

but to accomplish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have in the past. In fact, a student strike in Santo

Domingo, which began

January 9, 1967, has attracted strong

communist support and has served as a rallying point for the

extreme leftists.

kithin two days,

seventy percent of the

students in secondary schools had joined the strike.

This is but one of numerous problems which beset

Balaguer, although to date he has been able to meet each one

head on.

ROBERT G. BAKER

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

The most recent development relative to the trial

of Baker is the disclosure in the afternoon edition of "The

Evening Star," 1/12/67, that the Narcotics Bureau of the

Treasury Department installed a "bug" in the Baker case.

It

is reported that this installation relates to the Department's

admission during the trial that it had planted a microphone

and transmitter on Wayne Bromley, a prime Government witness,

in order to record the results of a meeting held on 3/26/65,

at the Beverly WilShire Hotel, Los Angeles, California; which

was attended by Baker, Clifford Jones and Bromley.

The

article points out that the FBI had refused a request of the

Department to cover this meeting.

It also points out that

according to Edward Bennett Williams, Baker's attorney, that

in compliance with an order of Judge Gasch to turn over tapes

and transcripts, only notes made by two monitors were received

indicating the tape was not usable or available.

This meeting at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel is the

meeting which was arranged during telephone calls on 3/25/65,

between Bromley and Baker and Bromley and Jones which were

monitored and tape recorded by the Bureau at the request of

the Department, with the Department's assurance that such action

was legal and with the written consent of Bromley. A complete

transcript of these recordings was made available

to the

Department.

Although the Department did on 3/25/65, request that

we monitor the meeting in Los Angeles, we refused to do so.

Upon revelation during pretrial hearings that this meeting

was monitored, Acting Attorney General Ramsey Clark was questioned

as to who performed this monitoring. He stated that he had ascer-

tained that upon the FBI's refusal to comply with the departmental

request, the Department had then turned to either the Imnigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) or the Bureau of

Narcotics.

He was certain that it was

the Bureau of Narcotics.

The only other coverage of any conversations by Baker

was accidental in nature and resulted from installations which

had been placed on Fred B. Black in Washington, D. C.; the

F remont Hotel, Las Vegas,

Nevada; Edward Siegelbaum,

Miami,

IN 55176 DocId: 32989646 Page 585

Florida, (all in connection with organized crime matters) and

the Dominican Embassy in connection with security matters).

Details concerning these installations were set forth in a

summary memorandum regarding the Bureau's involvement in the

prosecution of Baker, dated 1/10/67.

Logs relative to the electronic surveillances

on

Black, the F remont Hotel and Siegelbaum were furnished to

the Department and excerpts were furnished to the trial

judge

who ordered that they be made available to the defense:

These

logs were the subject of pretrial hearings during November, 1966,

following which the judge ruled that there was no causal

relationship between the information in the logs and the

charges in the indictment.

Logs concerning Baker's conversations intercepted

on the Dominican Embassy installation were similarly furnished

to the Department and to the trial judge who placed a

protective order thereon and has instructed that any dis-

cussions relative to them must be held only in his chambers.

Information as

to the existence of these logs has been

leaked to the press, presumably by Edward Bennett Williams

to cause some action

favorable to his client. His reporting

to the trial judge that the FBI was responsible for this leak

is absolutely ridiculous and is completely unfounded.

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

James Riddle Hoffa and three others were convicted

members of the jury in a previous trial of Hoffa.

These

convictions were upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court on 12/12/66.

In response to a request from Assistant Attorney

jeneral Fred M. Vinson, Jr.

we furnished a letter to the

Acting Attorney General on 12/29/66, of instances in whicl

the conversations of Hoffa and two other defendants were

overheard through the use of electronic devices. Hoifa, his

office, and his home were not the direct targets of

any

electronic devices in the development of this case,

and the

Acting Attorney General was so advised in our memorandum of.

12/29/66.

The instances in which he appeared to have been

present at conversations monitored occurred in Detroit,

Michigan, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 1961 and 1962 our Detroit office overheard

three conversations of Hoffa®

These conversations were

broadcast to and from radio-telephones in automobiles

operated by Teamsters Union personnel in the Detroit area.

This was accomplished through the use of a tunable

commercial-type FM radio receiver which was in operation in

our Detroit office. No trespass

was involved in this

connection.

In addition, between 2/1 and 8/12/63, Hoffa

appears to have participated in four telephone

conversations

with two Las Vegas hoodlum figures who were being covered by

electronic eavesdropping devices (trespass involved):

Hoffa's part of these conversations was not overheard.

Zeno Thomas Osborn, Jr., (Nashville lawyer and

former attorney for Hoffa) was convicted 5/29/64, in

Nashville Federal Court of obstruction of justice arising

from his attempts to influence a potential juror in a forth-

coming trial of Hoffa.. In this investigation, a miniature

recorder was concealed on a cooperative Government witness

during a meeting with Osborn. This installation

of the two Federal judges in Nashville.

fully during Osborn's trial.

His conviction was affirmed by

the Supreme Court 12/12/66. The Department is fully aware of

this installation and details of same were included in our

At the specific request of former Attorney General

Kennedy, a microphone surveillance (trespass required) was

conducted on the Washington, D. C., hotel room of James i.

Haggerty (former attorney for James Riddle Hoffa) during

period 8/7/61, through 8/11/61. This coverage was for the

specific purpose of identifying an alleged "contact" of

Hoffa's in the Justice Department, whom Kennedy thought

Haggerty would meet in Hashington.

Information concerning

this coverage was included in our letter to the Acting

In addition, in response

JURY PANEL INVESTIGATIONS

On January 9, 1967, a letter was forwarded to

the Acting Attorney General

advising him that in view of

the increasing sensitiveness to intrusion by the federal

Government into the rights of defendants in criminal

trials and in order to assure that future requests for

jury panel investigations would be made only in truly

exceptional cases, investigations of this nature should

not be undertaken by the Bureau except upon the specific

written request of the Attorney General or the Deputy

CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS IN MISSISSIPPI

Two major civil rights cases are awaiting

prosecutive action in Mississippi.

One of these cases

involves the murder of three civil rights workers near

Philadelphia, Mississippi, in June, 1964, in which case

eighteen subjects were previously indicted on civil rights

charges by a Federal Grand Jury. The other case involves

the shooting and burning of the residence of Vernon Ferdinand

Dahmer, past president of the NAAC?, near Hattiesburg,

Mississippi, in January, 1966, resulting in the death of

Dahmer •

Federal Grand Jury

indicted fifteen members of

the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi

relative to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights

Statute.

In view of a court decision subsequent to the

above indictments, it was determined by the Government that

all of the indictments in these two cases are faulty because

certain minority groups including Negroes had been excluded

from the grand jury.

The Department has been pushing for

early representations to a properly composed grand jury and

had contemplated that both of these cases would be given to

a Federal Grand Jury being empaneled 1/16/67.

On 1/3/67 U. S. District Judge Harold Cox advised

SAC Roy Moore that he had instructed the U. S. Attorney to

use the January grand

jury

for the purpose of checking into

possible misuse of funds in the headstart project sponsored

by the Office of Economic Opportunity in Mississippi. The

Judge referred to press accounts stating that the Government

was providing additional money for this project although

it has been alleged that several hundred thousand dollars

of the initial appropriation was unaccounted for. Judge Cox

said that he felt "first things come first" and therefore

decided to use the grand jury to ferret out any possible

fraud in connection with the failure to account for these

funds.

He stated he would advise SAC Moore

when he convenes

another grand jury to hear the civil rights

cases. Judge Cox

added that this will be done sometime in the near future

but that no specific date has been set. It has been

speculated in the press that if Judge Cox fails to promptly

call a*

grand jury to hear the civil rights cases the

Government will seek mandamus from the U.S. Circuit Court

of Appeals for the purpose of forcing Judge Cox to call a

grand

jury to hear these cases.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING CRIMES

AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS

By letter to the Attorney General 3/1/65, we called

attention to the rise in crimes against banking institutions and

recommended the Department propose legislation which would require

bank supervisory agencies to establish minimum security requirements

for all banks under Federal Charter. A follow-up letter was sent on

3/29/65, and again on 3/1/66. The Department advised on 4/12/66,

that a legislative proposal was being developed. A proposed bill was

submitted for our review on 6/6/66, which we returned on 6/9/66,

recommending no changes. In reply to our inquiry on 7/25/66, the

Department, on 8/3/66, advised the Bill was under study by the

Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

We inquired again on 10/6/66, and on 10/26/66, were

advised that since the 89th Congress was so near an end, the legis-

lation would be included on program for 90th Congress.

By letter

11/28/66, we were advised that the Bill had been returned to the

Criminal Division with certain observations and suggestions.. On

1/9/67, we again called attention to the increase in violations. Current

figures show that during calendar year 1966, violations increased to

1871, a new all-time high, surpassing the 1749 violations in calendar

year 1965.

WALTER BERYL CHIPMAN, ET AL.

CRIME ON HIGH SEAS

Alvin Junior Cupp, who had received a five-year

Federal term on 3/16/65, in Marquette, Michigan, furnished

intormation to Chicago Agents pinpointing officials and "goons"

of the Seamens International Union (SIU) responsible for the

1963 bombing of the Canadian freighter, - "Howard L. Shaw"

in Chicago, Illinois.

Upon Cupp's parole from prison 12/23/66, he was

immediately contacted by union officials allegedly for the purpose

of paying him off a promised $8, 000 for maintaining his silence

relative to the "Howard L. Shaw" bombing while in prison.

The U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago requested that an

electronic device be attached to Cupp's person to record con-

versations with union officials, anticipating evidence would be

obtained whereby prosecution of these officials would be

forthcoming. SAC, Chicago advised the U. S. Attorney on

1/4/67, that the Bureau could not accede to his request since the

Solicitor General had publicly announced that all eavesdropping

is illegal.

At approximately 9 P.M., 1/5/67, the Acting Attorney

General called Mr. De Loach relative to this case, indicating he

felt this was a legal device and he could see no reason why it

should not be used. Mr. DeLoach informed the Acting Attorney

General if he felt this way he should put these views in writing,

since the FBI could not afford to be criticized on one hand and then

on the other hand be directed by the Department to enter into such

procedures. The Acting Attorney General, upon a moment's

reflection, stated that in view of the "psychological situation" he

probably would not put this request in writing and perhaps would

inform the Organized Crime Section of the Department not to

request the FBI to utilize this device. We have since received no

such request from the Acting Attorney General.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY

HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE

MARCH 15, 1967

The "Washington Post" reported on March 16, 1967, that

Attorney General Clark opened hearings before a House Judiciary sub-

committee on March 15th relative to the Administration's request for

50 million dollars next year and 300 million dollars the following year

to assist state and local governments in modernizing their law enforce-

ment and corrective systems. Clark said that a successful war on

crime depends not on making it easier for police to seek confessions

but on improving their training and methods.

The Attorney General also said he had seen no evidence

that court decisions limiting admission of confessions had hampered

efficient law enforcement. Clark is reported to have opposed action

reversing court orders that suspects be told of their rights and be

offered counsel before being questioned.

Attorney General Clark said that since 1948 the FBI has

followed generally the same interrogation procedures which the courts

have now ordered the states to follow. The FBI has maintained a very

high average of convictions, showing "what excellence in training and

standards can do, " Clark said.

Clark also said he hoped Congress would not go "too far

on too little" until more evidence is in on the effect of the Supreme

Court's decisions.

COMMENT

The Attorney General failed to consider the fact that FBI

investigations are not normally hot pursuit, on-the-street situations.

When the FBl interrogates a suspect or subject, usually considerable

investigation has already been conducted and corroborative facts have

been developed which greatly assist the course of the interrogation.

On the contrary, police are frequently faced with fast-moving,

developing situations on the street where there is no opportunity for

the orderly accumulation of facts to supplement interrogation.

Congress is currently investigating the effect of the

Miranda decision on law enforcement and public safety. Senator

Birch Bayh (Democrat - Indiana) has been holding hearings around

the country regarding Miranda; however, testimony he has received

has been conflicting Generally law enforcement officials testify

that they have been handcuffed and defense lawyers and civil liber-

tarians take the opposite view. As of this time, neither side has

demonstrable statistical proof to substantiate its contentions. The

absence of clear proof is due, at least partially, to the fact that

Miranda is a new decision being handed down on June 13, 1966.

As of now there are few reported court decisions showing how trial

courts will interpret the requirements laid down in Miranda.

PRESS RELEASE OF MARCH 15, 1967

ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN'S "WEDNESDAY CLUB"

ENTITLED "ARE WE ORGANIZED TO FIGHT CRIME?"

On March 15, 1967, a group of 21 generally liberal

Republican Congressmen, members of the "Wednesday Club, " issued

a press release challenging the adequacy of the Federal Government's

organization to fight crime effectively and called for expansion of the

House Judiciary Committee's hearings considering crime legislation

to examine this aspect of the war on crime. The gist of their argument

is that a reorganization of Federal law enforcement and investigative

agencies is needed to effectively carry on the war against crime. The

press release suggests that there is "confusion, competition and dupli-

cation" among Federal law enforcement and investigative agencies which

is hindering the war against crime and that this can be eliminated only

through a complete reorganization of these agencies.

The entire argument of the "Wednesday Clüb" is based on

a false premise. Traditionally and historically, law enforcement in this

country has been the responsibility of local governments and states.

The Federal law enforcement agencies make only approximately 50, 000

arrests per year for Federal violations, while local and state police

make over six million arrests for criminal acts, not including traffic

offenses. Federal investigative agencies have very little jurisdictional

control over the more than three million serious crimes committed in

the United States in 1966. Reorganization of the Federal law

enforcement agencies is not the answer to the crime problem. The

real problem is at the local level where there are 40, 000 investigative

agencies, ranging from city constables to state police, and the problem

of multiplicity of jurisdiction is within the state. From the standpoint

of the FBI, there is daily liaison and exchange of information with all

Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies; our important

cooperative services are made available to all law enforcement agencies,

both on the state and Federal lével; and the FBI's National Crime Infor-

mation Center is an example of the cooperation which exists among law

enforcement agencies on all levels.

The press release of the "Wednesday Club" states that

the FBI maintains an informal semi-autonomy from Administration

55176 DooId: 32989646 Page 601

regulations, although organizationally responsible to the Department

of Justice, and cites as an example recent debates over wiretapping

procedures. This statement is without any basis in fact. The Director's

testimony before various legislative committees, as well as documenta-

tion produced by him in the recent "wiretapping" controversy, clearly

shows that the FBI's use of wiretaps was done with the specific knowledge

and approval of the Attorneys General and under strictly controlled

conditions. There is no exercise of autonomy whatsoever by the FBI

in this field.

The press release also charges that the FBI's involvement

in the foreign intelligence field, such as the Dominican crisis in 1965,

could detract from its domestic law enforcement and crime detection

functions.

This allegation also is factually unsupportable. FBI Agents.

were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1965 at the specific order of the

President; only three Special Agents are presently there, functioning

solely in a liaison capacity; statistical accomplishments by the FBI during

this period have been at their highest levels.

The action of the "Wednesday Club" was an obvious

attempt to secure a headline, which they incorrectly feel they have

found in the question of Federal organization.

MARCH 12, 1967

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

Attorney General Ramsey Clark was the guest of CBS program

"Face the Nation" which was telecast in Washington over WTOP-TV, at

12:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Sunday, March 12, 1967. This program

was moderated by CBS newscaster Martin Agronsky assisted by correspondents

George Herman of CBS and James Clayton of the "Washington Post. "

The principal topics discussed during this interview of the

Attorney General were: 1. The New Orleans investigation into the

assassination of former President Kennedy; 2. Wiretapping; 3. The

Supreme Court "Miranda" decision; 4. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell;

and 5. The death penalty.

Several references were made to the Director and the FBI

during this interview and all were favorable.

NEW ORLEANS INVESTIGATION

The Attorney General expressed his confidence in the

Warren Commission conclusion, based on FBI investigation, that assassin

Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing former President Kennedy. He

commented that most--if not all--of the individuals mentioned in the New

Orleans investigation were known to the FBI, which developed no evidence

that they were involved in the assassination. Clark declined to comment

on the mysterious individual known as "Bertrand" since New Orleans

authorities were then holding court proceedings to determine his identity.

WIRETAPPING

Clark commented that there were 38 wiretaps presently

authorized by his department, and that all of these were in national

security-type cases. He emphasized that procedares for his authority

in the use of all such devices have been improved, and he was satisfied

that none would nas be used without his approval.

"MIRANDA" DECISION

The Attorney General remarked that it was still too early

to determine what effect this decision would have on law enforcement

performance. He noted, however, that it has had no appreciable eitect

on FBI investigations which have for many years informed suspects of

their constitutional rights prior to interrogation.

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

POWELL

No decision has been reached by the Department concerning

possible Federal violations committed by Powell, according to Clark.

However, he expressed the hope that their determination might await any

further action against Powell by Congress.

DEATH PENALTY

The Attorney General stated he would recommend the

death penalty be abolished for certain Federal violations.

UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS

1966 PRELIMINARY ANNUAL RELEASE

On Wednesday, p.m., March 15, 1967, the FBI's

preliminary crime reports for 1966 were released to the press.

This report highlighted the fact that crimes of violence

were up 11%. There was a 9% increase in murder, a 10% increase

in aggravated assault, a 10% increase in forcible rape, and a 14%

increase in robbery. As a group, crimes against property increased

11% during 1966.

The sharpest crime increase was noted in the group of

cities having less than 10, 000 inhabitants. Crime in these cities

rose 14%. Large cities with over 100, 000 inhabitants had an average

increase of 10%, while crime in rural areas was up 7% and crime in

the suburbs rose 13%.

In the release dated March 15th the Director reiterated

the need for adequate firearms legislation, noting that there was a

23% increase in 1966 in serious assaults where guns were used. The

Director also highlighted the fact that six out of every ten murders

were committed with the use of a firearm. 71% of these murders

were committed with handguns, 17% with shotguns and 12% with rifles

or other type firearm.

police arrests of arints to or else its extens trailed

criminal acts (excluding traffic

oftenses) dropped 1/; however, arrests of persons under 18 years of

age increased 9%.

Our preliminary annual release also noted that nationally,

police solutions of crime index offenses averaged 25% and noted that

police solved 89% of murders, 72% of aggravated assaults, 65% of

forcible rapes, 35% of robberies and 21% of property offenses.

CRIME LEGISLATION

The Congress is presently holding hearings with

respect to the President's request for crime legislation entitled

"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967." This Act has its

basis in many of the recommendations of the President's Com-

mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.

The report of the Commission entitled "The Challenge of Crime

in a Free Society" was released February 18, 196%. The pro-

posed legislation would provide for a substantial financial aid

program to local and state law enforcement agencies for the

purpose of purchase of equipment, training, education and

research. It would also establish in the Department of Justice

an agency to administer the program headed by a Director of

Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Assistance. Depending

on how this new legislation would be administered within the

Department of Justice, it will have an impact and could contlict

with the FBI's long-standing cooperative services for local law

enforcement.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

By letter dated March 10, 1967, the Attorney

General requested FBI participation in a national conference

of local and state law enforcement administrators to be held

in the State Department Auditorium on March 28-29, 1967.

This conference was called by the President and has as its

purpose a discussion on how to implement the proposed

crime legislation. Since this conference and any new crime

legislation would affect directly the long-standing FBI coopera-

tive services to local law enforcement,

Assistant to the Director

DeLoach,

Assistant Director Casper and Inspector Jerome J.

Daunt have been designated to attend. The Attorney General is

being advised by letter dated March 17, 1967.

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a

computerized index of law enforcement information on crime and

criminals, successfully began its pilot test operation on January 27,

1967. At the present time the following police agencies are directly

on-line to the FBI computer:

Boston Police Department

Philadelphia Police Department

New York City Police Department

Washington, D. C., Metropolitan Police Department

Chicago Police Department

St. Louis Police Department

New Orleans Police Department

Maryland State Police

Virginia State Police

Georgia State Patrol

Texas Department of Public Safety, and

N. Denver FBI Field Office

These agencies are entering records on wanted

persons, stolen motor vehicles, and identifiable stolen property.

They are receiving replies to inquiries in a matter of seconds.

For example, a police officer on the street in New Orleans through

the use of his car radio is able to get information from the FBI

computer here in Washington within 1 1/2 minutes. The California

Department of Justice and the New York State Police are scheduled

to join the NCIC system on March 20, 1967. The system has had a

steady growth in building up the information that is stored in the

computer, increasing the number of hours that the computer is

"on the air" and in adding new participating police agencies.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN E. KENNEDY

BY NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JAMES C. GARRISON

In December, 1966, we received information that New Orleans

District Attorney James C. Garrison was conducting an investigation

of the assassination of the late President Kennedy. Garrison reported-

Iy was attempting to develop evidence showing that

David William

Ferrie, a homosexual who was a former airlines pilot, and lee Harvey

Oswald conspired with anti-Castro Cubans to assassinate President

Kennedy.

We were informed by several sources that Garrison Was basing

much of his investigation upon information furnished to him by Jack S.

Martin and David Lewis. Martin is a private investigator in

New Orleans and Lewis is a baggage handler at a New Orleans bus

station.

Both Martin and Lewis appear to be mental cases. During

our investigation of the assassination, we thoroughly investigated

allegations that Ferrie and Oswald were acquainted but we found

• no evidence to show this was true.

Garrison has made one arrest in his case - Clay L. Shaw,

a homosexual who was former Director of the International Trade Mart

In New Orleans. Shaw's name did not come up during our investigation

of the assassination. Garrison claims Shaw is identical with one

Clay Bertrand, an alleged contact of New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews.

We never located Bertrand and Andrews' acquaintance with Bertrand

highly doubted. We developed no information indicating Oswald knew

Clay Shaw.

On March 14, 1967, during a preliminary hearing in New Or-

leans for Shaw, Garrison produced a mystery Witness Perry Raymond

Russo who alleged that he was present at a meeting when Leon Oswald,

David Ferrie and Clay Shaw planned the assassination of President

Kennedy• Russo identified Leon Oswald as identical to Lee Harvey

Oswald.

Russo admitted receiving psychiatric treatment since 1959

and his testimony at the preliminary hearing was highly contradictory

to information he previously furnished to news media.

Russo appears

to be lying and during our investigation of the assassination, we

developed no information indicating Oswald ever knew Russo.

James C. Garrison is an egomaniac, is politically ambitious

and it appears his whole investigation was triggered by his desire

for publicity

The Director has instructed that we have no contact

with Garrison

or any member of his staff and that we stay meticulously

out of Garrison's inestigation.

It appears Garrison is looking for

an attempt to dump his investigation on this Bureau and the Director

has instructed that we should avoid such possibility

"like a plague."

SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

The field of education has long been a major

target of the Communist Party. The communists? emphasis

on students in the recent past was best expressed by

the Party's General Secretary, Gus Hall, when he stated

"Communism is big, really big, on college campuses now.

You've got to play the ball game where the players are and

the really good players are in college." Today there is

considerable unrest and agitation on college campuses

throughout the Nation.

Subversive agitators constitute the

major source behind this unrest and, from a long-range

viewpoint, these campus subversives may well become seriously

damaging to our national security. In light of this, the

FBI will continue to carry out its defined responsibilities,

whether they be on the

college campus or elsewhere, while

at the same time respect the spirit of academic freedom on

which our

college system is based.

The two major student and campus groups in the

United States today are the communist-inspired W. I. B.

DuBois Clubs of America, with an approximate membership of

425 members, and the Students for a Democratic Society, with

approximately 5,000 members. The Students for a Democratic

Society has been described by Gus Hall as a new left group

which

the Party has "going for us."

Today there is

a concerted effort on the part of

student groups to "knock" the FBI and other Government

agencies off the college campuses and to prevent such

agencies from carrying out their assigned duties.

example, in early March, 1967, a handful of Students for

a Democratic society members at Duke UnIversity, burnam,

North Carolina, alleged that the IBI in conducting investi-

gations on that campus was infringing on academic freedom

by securing information from responsible campus officials

and students. While we have interviewed

officials and students

at the University in matters within our jurisdiction the

charges that the FBI was infringing on academic freedom are

baseless.

¿ Another example involves allegations made by a

group of "liberal" faculty members at State University College,

Brockport, New York. This group alleged that the fBi was

having faculty members "spy" on other faculty members, again

raising the cry of infringement of academic freedom.

These

charges

also were baseless and without foundation.

TRAVEL OF THE PRESIDENT TO URUGUAY

At the request of the White House, a representative

of this Bureau

recently traveled to Uruguay

and participated

in briefings, surveys, and discussions relating to security to

be provided for the President when he attends the Summit

Conference of heads of American States to be held in Punta

Del Este, Uruguay, during the period 4/12-14/6%. The same

Bureau representative is returning to Uruguay to assist a

White House group in the implementation of security measures

prior to the President's arrival. A general assessment of

the situation in Uruguay at the present time indicates that

adequate security can be provided to the President if he

restricts his travel to Punta Del Este:

If he travels to

Montevideo proper, security problems could arise because of

a very militant Communist Party which already is manifesting

its protests to the President's visit.

The Communist Party

in Uruguay practically controls the labor movement and

potentially is in a position to paralyze facilities such

as

light, gas, water, and

street transportation.

Furthermore,

there is a good potential for committing sabotage and inciting

riots.

Under the present plan, the President will not

go

into Montevideo proper.

Security problems at Punta Del Este

are greatly minimized because the geographic location and

the resort-type atmosphere do not present any serious

obstacles for instituting good security.

The police and

security services

in Montevideo are not

efficient by our

standards, and it will take continuing prodding to make

certain that the necessary security measures are carried

The political stability of the Uruguayan Government is

There is a new Government which is shaky and is

suffering economic problems. There have been a series of

strikes during the last several weeks.

We have been told

that there will be between 1500 and 2500 newspapermen who

will attend the conference.

There may be some commotion

among them because of inadequate housing and communication

facilities. Newspaper reporters may also find it disappointing

to find any news of real significance at Punta Del Este if

there are no disturbing incidents.

WIRE TAPS AND OTHER COVERAGE UTILIZED IN THE

INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

Wire taps are utilized only in the internal security

field and when absolutely essential to carrying out our

investigative responsibilities.

Their number varies and

as

of this date we have 42 wire taps in operation. In addition,

JFK Act 6 (1) (C)

The importance of utilizing wire taps in the internal

security field. cannot be overemphasized in view of the dangers

that exist in

the internal security of the United States.

The

intelligence data obtained from such coverage makes it possible

to keep appropriate officials of our Government currently

aware of the activities, plans, strategy, and tactics of

subversive organizations and individuals.

Also, information

gathered from

these sources is of immediate interest

to the

United States intelligence agencies and officiale of the Govern-

ment in the formulation of plans in the foreign policy field.

We are not utilizing any microphone surveillances,

mail covers, or trash covers in connection with our investiga-

tions.

We are utilizing security informants and confidential

sources

to provide us necessary coverage.

Currently, we have

326 security informants who are members of the Communist Party

and some of these are operating at the highest level. In view

of the valuable coverage these

• informants provide us, we place a

great deal of emphasis on their utilization. It may be

interesting to note that during 1965, 15 of our security infor-

mants became members of the Communist Party and this

• was

increased to 3O informants becoming members of the Party in 11966.

In this connection, we noted that during those two years while

[45 Sinformants became members of the Party, [39] discontinued

their association with the Party primarily due to personal

reasons, thus leaving us a total gain of[sixinformants in the

COUNTERESPIONAGE WORK AGAINST THE SOVIETS.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)

and its intelligence organs constitute the major counter-

espionage problem confronting the FBI. The United States

is the major target against which the Soviet espionage

apparatus is directed.

All information received from

sources in a position to know confirms this. At this

529 Soviet officials with 643 dependents are in the

United States.

Of these officials, 225 are known and

suspected soviet intelligence ofilcers.

There has been

a, steady annual increase in Soviet intelligence officers

to this country.

We have achieved substantial success in pene-

trating the Soviet espionage apparatus. We are currently

operating two Soviet intelligence officers as defectors-

in-place (FEDORA and SHAMROCK) •

They are furnishing

detailed information on Soviet intelligence operations

and

on Soviet policies pertaining to this country.

Another Soviet intelligence officer (TOPHAT) who

was successfully operated by us, and who subsequently went

home, was posted to a country in the Far East (Burma)•

Contact has been re-established with him and he continues

to furnish information on soviet moves and operations.

Three Soviet officials who were successfully

operated by us during their duty tour in the United States

are presently out of touch in the Soviet Union (NICKNACK,

MITER, and KITTY HAWK). They constitute excellent potential

for future exploitation if their government subsequently

sends them on an assignment to another country:

CHINESE COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Communist China today has no diplomatic establishment in

the United States and Its major intelligence efforts directed

against this country emanate from two major sources, the United Nations

and the New China News Agency office in Ottawa,, Canada

We have identified two ethnic Chinese employees of the

United Nations Secretariat in New York as Chinese communist intelli-

gence agents. The first, Paul You, is a Senior Interpreter engaged

in collecting sensitive United Nations documents which are transmitted

to Communist China through an accommodation address in Switzerland.

FAN Chia-ching, also employed as Interpreter at United Nations, has

been in close contact with the Chinese Communist Consulate in

Geneva, Switzerland, and during recent months with a member of the

U.S. military who has a "Top Secret" clearance and is knowledgeable

in the field of ballistic missiles. FAN has been positively identified

as a Chinese communist intelligence agent,

Through our liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

we have learned that the Chinese communists are building a base in

Canada for intelligence operations directed against this country.

The New China News Agency (which is used as an arm of Chinese

intelligence) in mid 1966 sent an agent to New York City and

Washington, D. C., with the specific

assignment of establishing a

cover for a resident illegal agent.

A Bureau informant who has been directed against the

Chinese communists since 1964 returned to the United States March 13,

1967, following a mission to mainland China in behalf of the FBI.

This informant had a series of conferences with Chinese communist

intelligence officials, has been recrulted to operate in the

United States in behalf of the Chinese communists, and was furnished

a clandestine communications address in Canton, China. We,

of course, will use this informant to uncover other Chinese communist

illegal activities in this country.

In anticipation of Red China's admission to the United

Nations; we have greatly stepped up our efforts in the past two

years to build a solid base of quality informants to operate

against the Chinese communists.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

The Connunist Party, USA, is operating in an

atmosphere of optimism as a result of the March 3, 1967,

decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Washington, D.C.,

which stated that the Party could not be forced to register

under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950.

The feeling throughout the Party is that it has won its fight

for existence and now must move to capitalize on this victory

by becoming an effective force on the American scene.

Within this week the Party adopted various programs

in an effort to move out of its isolation from the American

people.

It is working toward the establishment of a daily

newspaper which is expected to be in operation in time to

have an effect on the national elections in 1968. Originally,

the Party planned to merge peace, labor, and civil rights

groups into a new political party which

would nominate a

candidate for President of the United States in 1968.

Now,

the Communist Party is seriously considering running

its own

candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of

the United States in 1968.

May 1, 196%, is to mark the institution of a

massive recruiting drive by the Party to take advantage of

the favorable Court decision and each Party district is being

instructed to start making plans for this recruiting drive

nOw.

In addition, Party leaders have called for more infil-

tration by Party members into the trade union movement in

an attempt to regain the power the Party had in this movement

in the 1940's.

The Party believes that youth must be the central

concentration for its work in the future.

In order to have

the most impact on the young generation and to gain recruits

quickly, the Party must make an effective appeal to youth.

Therefore, it is instituting a massive campaign against

United States policy in Vietnam, instituting resistance to

the military drait, and encouraging all types of demonstrations

by youth.

The tarty also will start a movement to have Congress

pass a bill guaranteeing full employment for all youth.

" The Party considers recruiting of youth its most

important project in 1967. Current plans call for doubling

the number of youth in the Party during the Summer of 1967,

and the nationwide establishment of Party schools to fully

indoctrinate these youth recruits in the principles of

DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES

INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM

Since United States aircraft attacked selected

targets in North Vietnam ToLloyang torpedo-boat assaults

against destroyers in the Gulf/ Tonkin in early August,

1964, there have been in the United States almost daily

demonstrations to protest United States intervention in

Vietnam. Many of these demonstrations have reached major

proportions.

The Communist Party and other subversive groups

such

as the W.F.B. DuBois Clubs of America, a communist-

inspired Marxist-oriented youth group; the Socialist Workers

Party,

which has been designated as subversive by the Attorney

General, and its youth affiliate,

the Young Socialist Alliance;

the Workers World Party, a communist splinter group and its

youth affiliate, Youth Against War and Fascism; and the

Progressive Labor Party, a pro-Chinese Marxist group, have

actively supported and

participated in demonstrations along

with the Students for a Democratic Society, a militant youth

group which has been described by Gus Hall, General secretary

of the Communist Party, USA, as

a group which the Party has

"going for us."

Pacifist groups such as Women Strike for

Peace, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,

the Committee for Nonviolent Action, and the National Committee

for a Sane Nuclear Policy have also taken a leading role in

Summaries showing the

highlights of these demonstrations are furnished to the

White House and other Government officials two or three times

a week.

The Spring Mobilization Committee and the Student

Mobilization Committee, both of which include members of the

Communist Party and other subversive groups in their

membership, are sponsoring demonstrations throughout the

United States April 8-15, 1967.

The focal point of the

week-long activity will be massive demonstrations at

New York City and San Francisco, California, on April 15.

The Reverend James Bevel is the National Director of the

Spring Mobilization Committee. Bevel is an official of the

Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, a civil rights

group which is headed by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Student Mobilization Committee is the brainchild of

Bettina Aptheker, a student at the University of California

at Berkeley and a member of the Communist Party, USA, National

Committee. An attempt is being made to have 500 individuals

burn their draft cards at New York City during the demonstration

on April 15, 1967, as a mass protest against the war and the

draft.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be

used in preventing communists from gaining control in that

country. At the height of the Dominican Revolution, we had

a staff of 14 Agents.

In August, 1966, at White House

instructions, we established

a permanent Legal Attache office

there staffed with three Agents.

Since his inauguration July 1, 1966, Dominican

President Joaquin Balaguer has brought about a degree of

stability, however, there continues to be strong undercurrents

of dissension. . The rightists reportedly have considered

plots to remove Balaguer.

Juan Bosch's political party, the

loser in the June, 1966, election, has been most vocal in

its opposition to Balaguer's programs and only recently

published a document which appears intended to set the

stage for a vast movement of resistance against Balaguer.

The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension

but to establish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have in the past. They possibly would be willing

to let Bosch's political

party provide the overt leadership.

and a pattern of long distance telephone calls between the suspects at

pertinent times.

Presentation to a Federal Grand Jury, Washington, D. C.,

commenced 3/10/67 but the grand jury is available to hear this case

only on Fridays. Additional witnesses are appearing 3/17/67 and it

is anticipated further testimony will be given the grand jury 3/24/67

and possibly 3/31/67.

Brandon Alvey, the trial attorney handling this case, has

described the Bureau's investigation as outstanding and said he has

never before seen so much good information gathered in such a short

time. Alvey states that if there was a statute making it a violation to

bomo diplomatic establishments in the United States, the evidence now

available would support a conspiracy conviction. There is no such

statute; however, the statute the Department considers most applicable

(Section 956, Title 18) makes it a violation to conspire in the United States

to damage property owned by a foreign government in a foreign country.

To successfully prosecute under Section 956, it must be

proven that the conspiracy originated in the United States. No violation

would exist if the conspiracy originated in Canada even if subsequent

discussions and other overt acts occurred in the United States. It is

unlikely that this point can be established unless a confession is obtained

from one of the conspirators. Alvey is making every effort to develop

the necessary evidence on this point in examining witnesses before the

grand jury and has laid the groundwork for possibly forcing testimony

from one or more prime suspects by offering immunity coupled with

a threat of contempt proceedings if testimony is withheld.

Trial attorney Alvey has indicated the grand jury is

enthusiastic but he does not expect to obtain a true bill unless additional

evidence is developed to prove the conspiracy to bomb the Canadian

establishments originated in the United States. We are vigorously

pursuing all logical possibilities to develop such information by

continuing investigation.

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

Hoffa and three others are presently serving

prison terms as a result of their conviction in Chattanooga

Federal. Court 3/4/64, on charges of obstruction of justice.

The only legal issues presently pending are two motions in

the Circuit Court of Appeals, Cincinnati, on which

arguments were heard 2/7/67,

and a motion for new trial

filed in U.S.

District Court, Chattanooga, 2/28/67 alleging

the Government's use of wire tapping and electronic

eavesdropping against Hoffa, his attorneys, and others.

These charges, so far as the Bureau and its personnel are

concerned, are completely false and the Government filed

its

response to this motion on 3/10/67. The Chattanooga

court is expected to rule on this motion in the near

future.

Although Hoffa is now in prison, his attorneys

nave continued unsuccessiully to shop around the t. s

supreme court in an estort to have one of the justices

release Hoffa on bail pending disposition of the pending

motions.

ROBERT EARL BARNES

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTAION OF STOLEN PROPERTY

Robert Earl Barnes is the notorious burglar with

an extensive arrest record who was the main witness at the

trial in District Court of 5 policemen charged with bribery

and conspiracy. Trial, which ended March 11, 1967, resulted

in the conviction of 3 District of Columbia police officers

and the acquittal of the other 2.

Barnes has admitted to our Agents the theft on

June 12, 1964, of a 34.10 carat diamond ring (appraised at

$120,000) from Mrs. John R. McLean,

a guest at the

Lucayan Beach Hotel, Grand

• Bahamas

Island. The diamond ring

was transported by

Barnes and an associate to New York City

where it was sold. Some of the evidence has been presented

to a Special Federal Grand Jury, however, prosecution of

Barnes for the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property

violation was held in abeyance pending completion of the trial

of the police officers.

On March 13, 1967, Assistant U. S. Attorney Harold I.

Sullivan, who is handling this matter, advised that it was the

specific instruction of U.S. Attorney David Bress that prosecution

of Barnes in connection with the McLean diamond should be

pursued and pertinent witnesses are to be called before the

Grand Jury.

This is being followed most closely.

BOMBING DEATH OF

WHARLEST JACKSON

AT NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1967

CIVIL RIGHTS

BOMBING MATTERS

A full investigation is being conducted at the Depart-

ment's request concerning the death of Wharlest Jackson at Natchez,

Mississippi, as a result of a bomb exploding in his pickup truck as

he left work at the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Company in Natchez

shortly after 8 p.m. on February 27, 1967.

Jackson had been employed by the Armstrong Company

since June, 1955. On February 20, 1967, he began training for a new

job as a cement mixer, a type of position previously held only by white

men. His particular job was a new position and was based on seniority.

Jackson had held the position of treasurer in the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People in the Natchez branch and is

survived by his wife and five children. George Metcalf, a Negro fellow

employee, also active in the National Assocation for the Advancement

of Colored People, who previously customarily rode to work with

Jackson, was seriously injured in a similar type explosion in 1965.

On the scene examination by Laboratory experts

indicates that a high-order explosive was detonated under the cab portion

of Jackson's truck directly beneath the driver. Fragments of wire

recovered at the scene appear to be wire from an electric blasting

cap, indicating that such a cap may have been connected to and

activated by the electric wiring system of the truck. Portionsof the

wires to the brake light, tail light, and left rear turn indicator light,

which were originally located on the inside of the left frame, are

missing as a result of the explosion. No additional physical evidence

has been disclosed to date.

Extensive investigation conducted under the on-the-scene

supervision of Inspector Joseph A. Sullivan indicates that a group known

as the Silver Dollar group is responsible for the bombing. The Silver

Dollar group is reportedly a secret group of Mississippi and Louisiana

Klansmen founded in June, 1965. One informant is presently a member

of the group but to date has been unable to establish the identity of :

persons responsible for the bombing. Intensive efforts are being

made to develop additional sources to furnish further penetration of

the group and to trace the electric blasting cap probably used to

detonate the explosive.

Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles.

Purpose of meeting

was

to get Bromley, a Government witness, to tailor his

testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given.

Bureau

declined to monitor this neeting because of lack of security

of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure

of the coverage.

Department then got Bureau of Narcotics

to assist in monitoring of the meeting.

Recently we have responded to Department's request

regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones.

Such coverage

involved twenty conversations over four Las Vegas and one

Miami electronic device. All conversations were inconsequential

and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones. This

coverage will be subject matter of future pretrial proceedings.

tion for the Advancement of Colored People, Forrest County,

Mississippi, was shot into and completely gutted by fire.

Dahmer died

the afternoon of the same date in a Hattiesburg,

Mississippi, hospital.

Extensive around-the-clock investigation conducted

by the FBI resulted in the indictment of 15 members of the

White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on June 22,

1966.

The

indictment charged these Klansmen with violation of the

Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Statutes. Those

indicted included Sam Holloway Bowers, Jr. Imperial Wizard

of the White knights of the ku klux Klan of Mississippi.

A motion was filed on behalf of 13 of the defendants

to dismiss this indictment based upon an objection to the

array of the jurors.

Based upon this action the facts were

re-presented to a Federal Grand Jury at Jackson, Mississippi,

which resulted in the indictment of 12 members of the White

Knights of the Ku Klux Klan' of Mississippi on February 27, 1967.

Lawrence Byrd, Sr., who was one of the original 15 indicted,

was named as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant by the

Federal Grand Jury on February 27, 1967.

This matter is presently pending prosecutive action.

REQUEST OF ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

VINSON, MARCH 14, 1967, RE LAKE COUNTY,

INDIANA, CRIME CONDITIONS

Assistant Attorney General Fred M. Vinson, JIa,

Criminal Division, requested preparation of an extensive summary

crime condition report concerning Lake County, Indiana. He asked

for information on gambling, racketeering, counterfeiting, narcotics,

shoplifting and other such matters. By letter to the Attorney General

on March 16, 1967, we pointed out we no longer make such reports

and our commitments preclude the preparation of such a study. This

is apparently a "fishing expedition" type request for Vinson's and

Petersen's Task Force. We advised them they have reports in

gambling and racketeering-type cases in Lake County, Indiana, where

recent prosecutive action has been taken against hoodlums.

The Department has embarked on a Crime Task Force

Program which solicits the active participation of the various Federal

investigative agencies. We informed the Department that there are

inherent drawbacks to such a program and are not actively partici-

pating in it. We have, however, advised the Department that if

matters within our jurisdiction arise during the Task Force Program,

we will handle such upon referral of these matters to us. We have

also agreed to conduct an indices and credit check of grand jury panel

in the Buffalo area, which is to be convened for the Task Force in

operation in that area.

Department attorney Peloquin advised a Canadian police

official that the FBI was participating in a "buy back" of United States

Postal Money Orders and we directed a letter to the Attorney General

on March 8, 1967, pointing out that Peloquin had misinformed the

Canadian authorities on our participation.

WIRETAPPING

The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary

Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone and wiretapping

were unnecessary in connection with control of crime in the United

States. Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to

legalize such practices are pending in the Congress. We directed a

letter to the Department dated March 6, 1967, concerning legislation

proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and

use of microphones with court approval in organized crime investiga-

tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would

be very beneficial to our efforts in the field of organized crime and

would appear to provide a statutory basis for practices now being

followed in connection with use of such devices in national security

matters. Microphones were of inestimable value in determining

La Cosa Nostra weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves,

and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa-

tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Cosa

Nostra sources of income.

In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior

microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals

courts, there has been to date no complete reversal of any of such

cases which were actually brought to trial. In several cases, notably,

Kolod-Alderisio in Denver, Colorado; Robert G. Baker in Washington,

D. C.; Frank Peter Balistrieri in Springfield, Illinois; Charles

Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami,

Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each

instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our

position that these cases were not tainted. In the Black case and in

the Schipani case in New York, the Supreme Court has remanded for

retrial and these are still under consideration.

convictions than at a similar time last year. In addition, we have in

excess of 350 individuals arrested and/or indicted and awaiting trial

for violations of these statutes. As a result of our dissemination

policies of gambling information to local authorities, we have directed

telling blows against La Cosa Nostra members active in this field by

virtue of numerous arrests made by local authorities.

During this fiscal year we have disseminated 159, 823

items of criminal information to local authorities, which is an increase

of 50, 000 items over this same period last year.

FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY

LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1965

The 79th Session of the FBI National Academy begins

Monday, March 20, 1967. There will be 100 law enforcement

officers in attendance with representatives from 45 states, the

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and I foreign officers trom

5 foreign countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Malaysia and

Thailand). (The Attorney General presented diplomas to the

graduating class of the 75th Session of the National Academy on

May 26, 1965, when he was Deputy Attorney General.)

On January 25, 1967, the Director sent a memorandum

to then Acting Attorney General Clark requesting that National

Academy representatives be included under the Law Enforcement

Assistance Act of 1965 as soon as possible for financial assistance

in helping to defray living expenses while attending the FBI

National Academy. We referred Mr. Clark to previous correspondence

on this same matter and a reply dated August 24, 1966, that

indicated that such support would be appropriate under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act. The Director pointed out that while

we anticipate having a continuing demand and desire to attend this

Academy, we do not feel this factor should have a bearing on the

allocation of funds under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act.

It was assumed in the Attorney General's reply in August, 1966,

that in view of the current limited capacity of the Academy plus

the ample demand and desire of local agencies to send candidates

it would be unnecessary at this time to be concerned about sub-

sistence aid.

It was estimated that approximately $80, 000 for

subsistence and travel would be needed for the March class and

that it would vary somewhat for each class and that if the Acting

Attorney General approved this concept; the Director stated a

request for a grant would be submitted on proper documents to

the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance.

We have never received a reply to this memorandum

even though we pointed out that several grants under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act have been awarded for the conduct

of police seminars and have included funds for financial assistance

of the attendees. The Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General that we are not asking for this money for the

FBI but that the funds would be helpful to the agency sending the

man to the National Academy. Although we have not conducted

a nation-wide survey, we are aware that many departments do

not submit applications to the National Academy because they

do not have the funds to pay the living expenses of their officers.

while they would be in Washington.

POLICE TRAINING

Assistance in training matters continues to be one of the

most sought after cooperative functions of the FBI. During calendar year

1966, the FBI assisted municipal, county and state law enforcement agencies

in 5478 training endeavors, attended by 163, 302 people. Over 1200 Special

Agents of the FBI are trained as police instructors, and during 1966, they

contributed 45, 383 hours of instruction time, free of charge, at police

training schools. Assistance is rendered in all types of schools, however,

special emphasis is being placed on police administration and management,

search and seizure, probable cause for arrest, due process in criminal

interrogation, laboratory matters, crime scene search, collection and .

preservation of evidence, human relations in police management, and

police-community relations.

NEW FBI ACADEMY

In May, 1965, the Director submitted a proposal to the

Attorney General for the building of a new FBI Academy on the

Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia. This suggestion was

immediately endorsed by the President and the Attorney General.

The Director's proposal outlined that with the new facility, instead

of training 200 local law enforcement officers annually at the FBI

National Academy. we could train 1, 200 and up to 1, 000 local law

enforcement officers in specialized courses.

The Congress has

appropriated funds for the construction of this new facility.

The planning and engineering work on the site is in

progress and it is anticipated that the contract for the construction

of the Academy will be let sometime during the summer of 1967. It

is believed that the new Academy will be ready for occupancy during

fiscal year 1969.

EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM

Executive Order 11315 established an Executive

The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super-

vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this

inventory all such employees, including those in the FBI. This

would make our executives available for consideration by other

agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider

employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The

Department, therefore, was requested by letter dated December 21,

1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request-

ing exclusion of FBI executives from the proposed inventory as

retention by the FBI of its executives is considered essential. We

have been following with the Department but the matter has not yet

been acted upon by the Attorney General.

SYNOPSIS:

Director has accepted Attorney General's luncheon invitation

for Friday, September 8. Pertinent items of possible interest for discussion

at luncheon include:

(1) The Attorney General (AG) called Mr. DeLoach on 9-5-67 concerning

FBI's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. AG said he

had contacted Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at White House and also planned to

meet with Dick Helms of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter

of National Security Agency (NSA). AG said Clifford and Rostow were surprised

1

FBI had so little coverage--and they hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use

surveillances, it might be good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic

intelligence to CIA. AG said he was opposed to this idea; that it would take time

to bring Clifford and Rostow around, but FBI would come out ahead and he (the

AG) would have more liberal hand in approving FBI requests.

Regarding above, Mr. DeLoach noted it would be premature to

talk with Rostow or Clifford now; but after a decision has been reached, they

could be confidentially briefed on such FBI operations. Information confidentially

obtained reflects that Helms of CIA had a meeting scheduled with AG on 9-6-67--

the subject of which probably was electronic surveillances.

with the Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel to areas where

substantially.

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(3) On 8-8-67, the House passed H.R. 5037, the Law Enforcement and

Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the Administration's "Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act') -but with considerable changes. One amend-

ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police

training--thus duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This matter

has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee.

Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine

their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and

add this to H.R. 5037.

(4) AG has indicated desire to achieve about 400 convictions in organized

crime field during this fiscal year. As of 9-7-67, a total of 382 individuals in

this field were awaiting Federal prosecution. By letter of 7-27-61, ve called the

AG'S attention to a Situation wherein 23 persons arrested in New York for gambling

law violations in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive action. To date, no

treply has been received from AG.

(5) Latest two issues of "Life" magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith,

former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well

as their political affiliations, and the need for electronic surveillances to cope

with organized crime. Smith has extensive background and contacts qualifying

him to write on organized crime. It is obvious he obtained help from such persons

as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre Dame, formerly in the Organized Crime

Section of Department.

(6) The "task force" organized under direction of Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section of Department conducted an operation against bookmaker

Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs

Service that the Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart's

activities. According to officials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys

and others on the "task force" appeared at the police department and "took over"

entire investigation. "Task force" was so inept that it "blew" the case against

Reinhart, and "task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinhart and

associates. Although Reinhart's gambling activities were across state lines from

New York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were

brought to AG's attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requested that "task force"

be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction.

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(7) For first month (July) of new fiscal year, FBI convictions

decreased 180, or 22 percent. Decrease primarily due to: (a) shortage of

Judges and prosecutors, resulting in overcrowded court conditions, and (b)

policy enunciated by Department's Criminal Division to reduce Federal

prosecutions of juvenile offenders. In July, 1966, Assistant AG Vinson sent

letter instructing U. S. Attorneys regarding diversion of subjects under age

21 to local authorities--which has principally been felt in Interstate Trans-

portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle violations, where experience indicates

about 65 percent of violators are under 21 and where F'BI convictions.

decreased 109 in July. 1967 compared with July, 1966. For sometime,

we have been advising AG whenever shortages of Federal judges or shortages

in U. S. Attorneys Offices exist.

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

DETAILS:

The Director has accepted an invitation for a luncheon with the

Attorney General on Friday, September 8, 1967. There is contained in this

memorandum succinct data concerning pertinent items which might be of

interest for discussion on this occasion. The General Investigative, Special

Investigative and Domestic Intelligence Divisions have contributed salient

information for this memorandum.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES:

On 9-5-67, the Attorney General called Mr. De Loach regarding

the Bureau's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. He

said he had finally made contact with Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at the

White House on 8-31-67 and that he planned to meet with Dick Helms of the

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter of the National Security

Agency (NSA) regarding this matter.

The Attorney General said Clifford and

Rostow knew little about electronic surveillances and were very surprised that

the FBI had so little such coverage.

He said that Clifford and Rostow, without

saying so, hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use surveillances, it might

be a good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic intelligence to CIA.

The Attorney General said he was opposed to this idea.

He

said it would take a little time to bring Clifford and Rostow around but that he

believed the Department and the FBI would come out ahead in the discussions

and that he, the Attorney General, will then have a more liberal hand in

approving requests from the FBI. In this connection, Mr. De Loach noted

that it would be premature to talk with Clifford or Rostow at this point but

after a decision has been reached, these two individuals could be briefed on

a confidential basis regarding such FBI operations. It was also noted that it

did not appear the Attorney General could adequately represent the FBI in his

discussions with Clifford and Rostow.

We have confidentially obtained the information that Richard

Helms, Director of the CIA, had a meeting scheduled with the Attorney General

at 5 p.m., on Wednesday, September 6, 196%, and that the subject of the

meeting was probably electronic surveillances.

H. R. 441, INTERSTATE TRAVEL TO INCITE RIOPS:

This bill was passed by the House on 7-19-67. It provides for

Federal prosecution of persons who travel interstate with the intent to incite

a riot. Its practical and legal usefulness has heen questioned by a numbor uf

people, including many.Senators, due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining

evidence to prove intent. Our Hill sources have advised there was a hope the

Bill could be bottled up in committee unless it could be changed to make it

more practical. These sources concede the Bill will pass the Senate without

difficulty if it reaches the floor because many Senators would consider it

politically unwise to vote against it.

We took no stand on the Bill with the

Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel by militant Negroes

and hate group leaders to areas where strife developed. The Bill, if passed,

could substantially increase our investigative responsibilities, depending, of

course, on the policy established by the Department.

H. R. 5037, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE

ACT OF 1967:

This is the Administration's bill, originally called the Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act, although it has been changed considerably by

Republican-sponsored amendments made when the House passed the bill on

8-8-67. One of these amendments by Congressman Robert McClory (R. -Ill.)

which changed Title 3 of the Bill, would empower the regional institutes to

engage in police training. This would duplicate and compete with the extensive

police training program we conduct on our own and in cooperation with local

and state agencies. This has been brought to the attention of our friends on

the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of them have voiced agreement and

stated they will take the necessary action to correct this wrong. Our Hill

sources have advised that Senator John McClellan (D. -Ark.) and Senator Roman

Hruska (R. -Neb. ) plan to combine their bills authorizing controlled use of

wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and to add this to H. R. 5037 in Committee.

They feel wiretap legislation as a part of the Administration's crime bill will

have an excellent chance for passage and possible acceptance by the President.

ORGANIZED CRIME:

As of September 7, 1967, there were a total of 382 individuals,

involved in organized criminal activities, who have been arrested, indicted,

or awaiting further prosecutive action in connection with violations of

various Federal statutes.

By letter dated July 27, 1967, the Bureau called to the attention

of the Attorney General a situation where 23 individuals arrested in New York

for violations of the gambling laws in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive

action. It was called to the attention of the Attorney General that prosecutive

action taken at the earliest possible date with reference to these individuals

would greatly assist in increasing accomplishments in the organized crime

field during the present fiscal year. To date no response from the Attorney

General has been received to this communication.

The Attorney General has indicated that he is desirous of

achieving in the neighborhood of 400 convictions of individuals involved in

organized crime during this fiscal year. With 382 such subjects already

awaiting prosecution, the Attorney General's goal would appear to be readily

available it vigorous prosecutive action is taken of these individuals at the

earliest possible date by the Department.

"LIFE" MAGAZINE ARTICLE:

"Life" magazine has run articles for the last two weeks on

La Cosa Nostra, which articles were written by Sandy Smith, former crime

reporter for the "Chicago Tribune "* Smith has done an excellent job in these

articles in focusing public attention on the Cosa Nostra leaders as well as

their political affiliations and the need for electronic surveillances in order

to cope with the menace of organized crime.

Smith is an outstanding investigative reporter who has a

wealth of independent knowledge built up over the years on La Cosa Nostra.

He also has tremendous contacts among the local and state police intelligence

agencies throughout the country. In addition, it is obvious that he obtained

considerable help from such persons as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre

Dame, former Departmental Attorney in the Organized Crime Section, in

*and "Chicago Sun-Times.".

connection with this article. He also has used the information disclosed

Patriarca matter, etc.

DEPARTMENT TASK FORCE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK:

In October, 1966, under the direction of the Organized Crime

and Racketeering Section of the Department, a "task force" was organized

as an investigative operation, supervised by Department Attorneys, and to

which were assigned representatives from various Federal investigative

agencies.

On August 21 and 23, 1967, the "task force" conducted

investigative activity, including physical surveillances in the Niagara Falls,

New York, area. The subject of its investigation was one Ernest Reinhart,

a bookmaker from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, who was said to be

making trips daily to Niagara Falls, New York, to establish regular contacts

and gambling pickups from other known gamblers. The Niagara Falls, New

York, Police Department, which was also investigating the activities of

Reinhart, had requested the assistance of the United States Customs Service

to develop sufficient evidence to establish a violation of the local gambling

statute. A representative of the Customs Service notified the "task force"

representatives of the local police department's interest in this matter and

immediately thereafter, according to the officials of the Niagara Falls Police

Department, attorneys and other members of the 'task force" appeared at the

police department and "took over" the entire investigation.

SAC Neil J. Welch of our Buffalo Office has since determined

from representatives of the Niagara Falls Police Department and the Customs

Service that the investigative activity of the "task force" was so inept that the

case against Reinhart was "blown." (In conducting a surveillance the task force

utilized a panel truck and their actions, while in the panel truck, were such that

they caused the truck to rock back and forth revealing to the gamblers who were

watching: that people were inside the truck.) Surveillances conducted by the

"task force," including attorneys assigned thereto, were readily discovered by

Reinhart and his associates. Reinhart remarked to a customs agent at the

border crossing that he would give the investigators a good run around.

• Although Reinhart's gambling activities were being carried on

between Canada and the United States, that is across state lines, in apparent

violation of the Interstate Transportation in Aid of Racketeering Statute, the

FBI Office at Buffalo was not notified. The FBI has a substantial investigative

responsibility in the investigation of violations of this statute. In this

instance, Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and the local

Niagara Falls, New York, Police Department also have investigative

responsibilities.

Pertinent details concerning this matter were brought to

the attention of the Attorney General by our letter dated September 5, 1967,

with the request that necessary instructions be issued to the "task force"

personnel that matters within FBI jurisdiction be immediately reported to

our Buffalo Office.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - CONVICTIONS:

At the end of July, 1967, we had recorded 189 fewer con-

victions than were recorded during the first month of the prior fiscal year.

This represents a decrease of 22%, which is primarily the result of two

factors: (1) shortages of judges and prosecutors which result in over-

crowded court conditions and (2) the policy enunciated by the Criminal

Division of the Department to reduce prosecutions in Federal court relating

to juvenile offenders.

In this connection, our potential for increasing conviction

statistics was decimated as a result of a letter sent during July, 1966, by

Assistant Attorney General Vinson instructing all U. S. Attorneys to give

primary consideration to the diversion of subjects under 21 years of age to

local authorities. These instructions are being followed by a majority of

U. S. Attorneys and have hurt us principally in Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Motor Vehicle violations where experience has shown that approximately

65% of all violators are under 21 years of age. At the end of July, 1967, we

recorded 109 less convictions in this category as compared to the first month

in the previous fiscal year.

We have for sometime been following the practice of advising

the Attorney General whenever shortages of Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys

or their assistants exist.

For example, we recently sent the following letters

to the Attorney General SPing to his attention shortages of judges or U. S.

Attorneys in the indicated areas:

9-1-67, Southern District of Georgia;

8-16-67, Eastern District of Michigan;

8-7-67; District of Kansas;

8-3-67, District of New Jersey;

8-2-67, Southern and Northern Districts of Mississippi;

7-31-67, Western District of New York.

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

In connection with the situation in the Western District of

New York, we originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on

3-30-67 and we have received no information indicating that an appointment

has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity

has attended the failure to appoint a judge for this district.

With regard to the two vacant judgeships in the Eastern District

of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's

attention on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information

indicating these judgeships have been filled.

Each SAC has been instructed to keep the Bureau currently

advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue

to bring these matters to the attention of the Attorney General:

As an example of shortages which have been brought to the

Attorney General's attention, in connection with the shortage of judges in

the Southern District of Georgia, it is noted that as of September 1, 1967,

there was a total of 87 Bureau cases awaiting prosecution involving 121

defendants. Of these 22 representing 32 subjects have been pending prose-

cution for more than six months.

It is also noted that in the District of New Jersey as of

July 1, 1967, there were approximately 200 Bureau cases awaiting prose-

cutive action involving approximately 392 defendants. Our New York Office

has also advised that it has 775 cases awaiting prosecution representing 874

subjects.

The following data concerning the antipoverty workers'

involvement in racial disturbances has been prepared for the

Director's information and possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference which will include the Attorney General and

: Mr. Shriver of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO).

ALLEGATIONS OF INVOLVEMENT OF ANTIPOVERTY EMPLOYEES

There have been a number of allegations regarding the

involvement of antipoverty employees in racial disturbances and

involving the misuse of antipoverty funds in connection therewith,

Allegations with respect to the misuse of these funds are

exceptionally difficult to substantiate because the funds provided

to local antipovertyagencies by 0EO or other Federal agencies are

usually furnished on a grant basis with the grants becoming the

property of the local group at which time the Federal character

Nof the funds is lost.

i .

However, there have been instances wherein certain

officials and employees of local agencies receiving Federal anti-

poverty grants have reportedly not conducted themselves in a

manner conducive to law and order.

Examples follow.

Action Movement, a clandestine all-Negro revolutionary group

that calls for the overthrow of the U. S. Government by violence

and which is procommunist Chinese-oriented, were suspended as

employees of Haryou - Act following their arrest last June along

with a number of members of the Jamaica Rifle and Pistol Club,

a Revolutionary Action Movement front group, on charges including

conspiracy to advocate anarchy. Another member of this rifle

club who was arrested, Arthur harris, was also suspended as an

employee of an antipoverty organization in Jamaica, New York City,

which is funded by OEO.

Newark. New Jersey

In Newark, antipoverty funds were reputedly utilized

by the United Community Corporation to rent two station wagons

used to transport people who had been encouraged to appear at

meetings at the city hall to protest action of a city planning

board. Reportedly, one of the vehicles was equiped with a loud-

speaker and was used to make inflammatory remarks regarding the

incumbent city administration. Also, it is reported that

inflammatory posters prepared by the United Community Corporation

had been circulated.

Syracuse. New York

Employees of the Crusade for Opportunity, an antipoverty

agency funded by OEO, are alleged to have been involved in the

racial disturbances which occurred in Syracuse, New York,

8/16-18/67. An officer of the Syracuse Police Department advised

that a Crusade for Opportunity automobile bearing U. S. Government

license plates was used by two Negro males and two Negro females

to cruise through Negro neighborhoods in Syracuse on 8/15/67.

They utilized a loudspeaker to advertise a meeting on 8/16/67

regarding "the alleged rape of an ll-year-old Negro girl by a

white man.

A field worker of this organization, Leroy. Glenn Wright,

was arrested during the first night's disturbance ón 8/16/67 and

charged with inciting to riot and resisting arrest.

a former Communist Party organizer in Harlem and a militant black

nationalist, is the head of the Harlem Back Street Youth, Incor-

iporated, which was the recipient of OEO funds.

Such funds have

since been suspended. Gray and at least one other member of the

above organization were arrested for their part in this disturbance.

Also involved in this disturbance and arrested was Robert Bailey

Ransom, an employee of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)

Associates, an OEO-funded organization.

Hate-type Schools

The New York City Police Department advised on 8/9/67

that the walls of a school handling a program entitled "Special

Training in Reading" for children 8 to 10 years of age contained

numerous hate slogans.

Examples of the signs noted thereon were

"Don't love them to death, shoot them to death; make revolution

not war; burn, baby, burn; arm yourselves; Johnson is losing

sleep; Newark, '67; Chicago South Side, '66; Watts, '65, and

Harlem, '64." There was also a picture of President Johnson's

face superimposed on an Army sergeant carrying a rifle captioned

"Public Enemy Number One, Wanted for Murder."

The committee

l'handling this particular

program was funded

in part by ObO.

A somewhat similar situation occurred in Nashville,

Tennessee, in connection with a "Liberation School" which has

been in operation teaching 10 and 11-year-olds. Antipoverty

funds from OEO had

been earmarked for the school; however, the

funds were withdrawn when national publicity resulted concerning

this matter. Meantime, however, certain services including the

rental of an automobile and school supplies had been furnished.

RE: LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

MISUSE OF FBI INFORMATION BY OEO

In connection with the recent arrest by Kentucky

authorities of Alan and Margaret McSurely, employees of the

Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph I. Mulloy, an

employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state

sedition charge, someone in EO apparently leaked to the press

a report prepared by an 0EO investigator which contained state-

ments attributed to the FBI. An article concerning this matter

appeared in the 9/1/67 issue of "The Evening Star."

The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous

protest with OEO concerning the fact that information appearing

in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published in "The Evening

Star." In approving this action, he noted "Yes, and if they

can't of won't give us the necessary assurances against leaks,

we will cut off all investigative services to OEO."

Such a protest was lodged through liaison with

Mr. Edgar May, Assistant Director, OEO, on 9/5/67 who advised

that steps had been taken to insure that such did not recur

in the future. A detailed memorandum is attached.

STATEMENTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED LAW AND ORDER

While no direct evidence has come to the Bureau's

attention of outright seditious statements on the part of anti-

poverty workers, allegations have been received of statements

against established law and order and of statements tending to

incite the people.

Examples follow:

Marion S. Barry, JI., former Washington Director of

the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, joined the United

Planning Organization, Washington, D. C., as a $50-a-day consultant

on 7/21/67. This organization is funded by OEO. On 6/30/67 Barry

reportedly conducted a press conference on the steps of the 13th

Precinct, Metropolitan Police Department, at which time he

denounced the Police Department and stated that Negroes would

continue to threaten the police until policemen are trained

properly in how to deal with Negroes.

Captain Al Prezio of the

Troy, New York, Police Department, advised on 8/25/67 that

Freeman Robinson, an employee of an antipoverty organization

funded by OEO, uses the office of the antipoverty organization

as a headquarters to conduct militant civil rights work and to

recruit teen-agers to incite riots and arouse a Negro community

on any issue that would create racial unrest.

Willie Wright, a duly-elected board member of the

United Community Corporation, Newark, New.

Jersey, is alleged

to have made statements concerning Negro rioting such as "To

hell with President Johnson when he says something about not

tolerating riots. We've tolerated these conditions for more

than 400 years."

He is also quoted as having said: "It is my

firm conviction that in order to overcome the white man's complete

human and legal jurisdiction over my black brothers and sisters,

we are going to defend ourselves against all kinds of aggressions

that are being perpetrated against us by the white man.

I most

emphatically want to make sure the majority of my black brothers

and sisters have a piece of firepower in their home possessions

to protect themselves against the most brutal

atrocities to be

seen anywhere committed by the New Jersey National Guard, the

Newark and State Police in the recent rebellion in the City of

Newark." The OEO has requested Wright's suspension pending its

investigation of statements attributed towright.

"The Washington Post" of 9/13/67 'contained an article

by Columnist Roscoe Drummond captioned "Mayors Say OEO Programs

Helped Suppress City Riots" in which he refers to a nationwide

survey conducted by 0EO in 64 cities, half of which had riots

this summer. In citing OEO figures he pointed out that of 30,000

Community Action employees only 16 were arrested during the course

of the riots and none were convicted. Poverty programs had 244

buildings in the hearts of the riot areas with none being burned

or destroyed.

dean

My memorandum of 9/14/67 set forth for the Director's

information data concerning antipoverty workers' involvement in

racial disturbances for his possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference mentioned above.

".

The following additional information received from the

Dallas Office today is being submitted for the Director's

consideration in connection with this luncheon.'

In response to a request from Mr. Randolf Ratliff,

Director of the Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty in

Dallas, Texas, a representative of this Bureau explained the

FBI's jurisdiction in racial matters to members of Ratliff's

staff, who work in the poverty areas in Dàllas County Texas, on *:

9/6/67. The Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty is funded

by the Office of Economic Opportunity.

UNRECORDED

On 9/13/67 one of Ratliff's staff workers confidentially

advised that after our representative had left the above meeting,

Ratliff instructed his staff members to give the FBI no informa-

tion and said that the FBI 'is the white man's police and they

want nothing but "stool pigeons."

This individual further

alleged that all of Ratliff's 44 staff members were hand-picked

by Ratliff and that most of them are racial agitators.

He

charged that Ratliff and most of the staff members are working

at creating racial incidents in order to stir up local Negro

communities. He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving

force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County

and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and

antipolice. He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying

to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional

antipoverty funds.

The source of the above information also alleged

that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of

the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-

old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in

the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the

arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity

learned of his activity and told him to desist. He stated that

in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic),

staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were

in possession of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot.

He claimed that Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming

the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov

cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in

preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action.

Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb

an "Uncle Tom."

The above information is being made available to

Mrs. Stegall at the White House, Mr. Shriver of the Office of

Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated

9/18/67.

ACTION:

Submitted for the Director's possible use.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re: Director's Meeting with

Assistant Attorney General

Will R. Wilson

A number of case writeups are set forth which are believed

to be of interest to the Department, particularly AAG Wilson. Included

are fraud cases against the Universal Fibreglass Corporation (thirteen

million dollar contract to produce mail delivery trucks); Youth Pride,

Inc., Washington, D. C. (payroll padding); Chromcraft Corporation

('"paper" corporations formed to act as subcontractors in connection

with production of rocket launchers for United States Navy).

Writeups are also submitted concerning financier Louis

Wolfson and his alleged dealings with Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas

based upon information furnished by the Internal Revenus Service;

the bribery case involving Congressman George H. Fallon (allegations

received that payoffs totaling $200, 000 were made to Congressman

Fallon and Lawson B. Knott, Jr., former General Services administrator,

in return for obtaining commitments for Government occupancy of

office buildings). Our New York Office developed information that a

theft ring existed at John F. Kennedy Airport, New York City, and

it is anticipated Federal Grand Jury will indict 15 to 17 individuals.

Attorney General Mitchell has reportedly expressed interest in this

case (Sidney Steinschreiber; And Others, Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Property).

ACTION:

This is submitted for information, and attached are more

detailed writeups concerning the above matters.

DETAILS:

ORGANIZED CRIME

ALBERT M. BILLITERI

EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS

Billiteri is a Buffalo, New York La. Cosa Nostra

member in the "family" of "Commission" member Steve Magaddino,

and operates a major loan-shark racket in the Buffalo area on

behalf of Joseph Fino, the "underboss" of the Magaddino family.

On 4/23/69, the Attorney General approved a recommendation for

microphone and technical surveillance at two of Billiteri's

key locations where this illegal activity is carried on.

The

Attorney General authorized a Department Attorney to handle

the filing of affidavits with the Federal court in Buffalo,

NEW

York, to obtain the necessary court order for

the

electronic surveillance sought, pursuant to Title 3 of the

Omnibus Crime Bill.

The Department Attorney, in conjunction

with our Buffalo office, was to make application to the court

on 4/28/69, the necessary affidavits to be filed by a Bureau

Agent.

This is the first such application we have made

pursuant to the provisions of Title 3.

MANHATTAN JOINT STRIKE FORCE

The Department has proposed a strike force with the

stated objective of making a concentrated drive against

organized crime in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.

This apparently has been enlarged to include the Bronx in

view of the inclusion of the Bronx County District Attorney

on the Strike Force Council. This strike force is to be

composed of Department Attorneys, members of the staffs of

the District Attorneys of New York and Bronx Counties, members

of the New York City Police Department and investigators from

the various Federal investigative agencies, including the FBI.

The Federal Government is to provide the office space and office

equipment.

A supervisory council has been named to make

decisions of strategy and timing and approve all planning. The

members of the Council have been named as Assistant Director

in Charge John F. Malone of our New York office, the District

Attorneys of New York and Bronx Counties, Police Commissioner

of New York City, Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson, the

Assistant Secretary for Law Enforcement of the Treasury

Department, the Chief of the Organized Crime and Racketeering

Section of the Department, and the U.S. Attorney of the

Southern District of New York.

ANTIRIOT LAWS

Chicago Cases

On March 20, 1969, the Federal Grand Jury at Chicago,

Illinois, based upon extensive Bureau investigations; returned

indictments against seven leaders of the New Left and one leader

of the Black Panther Party all of whom were charged with

Antiriot Laws violations in connection with the Chicago disturbances

at the time of the Democratic National Convention. Trial has been

set for September 24, 1969.

San Francisco Case

After extensive FBI investigation the Department commenced

grand jury proceedings on April 23, 1969, at San Francisco in

connection with Antiriot Laws violations allegedly committed by

three Black Panthers who gave instructions in the use of firearms

and explosives during a conference held by the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco last November.

Philadelphia Case

We have conducted extensive investigation into Antiriot

Laws violations in connection with the Black Power Conference held

in Philadelphia in August and September, 1968. Approximately 3, 000

to 4, 000 Negroes from all over the country attended this conference

during which five subjects provided instruction in the use of firearms

and explosives for a closed meeting of approximately 70 persons.

Inauguration Disturbances

On April 18, 1969, the Department requested investigation of

fifteen subjects who allegedly came to Washington, D. C., on inauguration

day for the purpose of creating disorders. This investigation is being

conducted on an expedite basis.

Campus Disorders

At the present time there are also a number of Antiriot Laws

investigations being conducted with regard to recent campus disorders,

most notably at Brandeis University where two professors from San

Francisco State College allegedly contributed to the seizing of the

Administration Building on January 8, 1969, and American University,

Washington, D. C., where members of the Students for a Democratic

Society allegedly traveled to Washington, D. C., and participated in

seizing a building on the campus on April 23, 1969.

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION

OF-STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

INVESTIGATIONS (DYER ACT)

In the fall of 1967, the former Attorney General and his

staff held conferences with various United States Attorneys (USA)

here in Washington, D. C. Following these conferences, we learned

of a divergence of opinion among USAs concerning the Department's

views in prosecuting Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle

(ITSMV) cases. Some had the opinion that only automobile theft ring

cases should be prosecuted in Federal court while others were of the

opinion that only cases having commercial aspects should be considered

for such prosecution. Other USAs felt only cases possessing aggravated

circumstances should be considered. Some continue to consider each

case on its individual merits. During the period October, 1967,

through May, 1968, we wrote four letters to the former Attorney

General requesting the Department's views concerning the prosecution

of these cases. In a letter dated April 12, 1968, to the Department,

we set forth our views that prosecution of Dyer Act cases in Federal

court should not be restricted to commercial matters and to adults,

but rather that each case should be considered on its individual merits.

None of these letters were answered. On March 5, 1969, we wrote the

present Attorney General informing him of the divergence of opinion among

USAs. This letter also requested the Attorney General furnish us his

views concerning this matter; however, an answer has not been received

to date.

UNIVERSAL FIBREGLASS CORPORATION

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Following a partial audit by General Services

Administration, we instituted an investigation, at Depart-

ment's request, of alleged overcharges to the Government by

Universal Fibreglass Corporation (Universal) on a $13 million

contract to produce mail delivery trucks. All logical investi-

gation has been completed and reported except the review of the

Universal records.

Access to the pertinent records was recently

achieved through court action and an extensive audit is now

being pressed.

Criminal prosecution of several subjects is

now indicated.

Congressman H. R. Gross (R-Iowa) has publicized

this matter.

Press items

have indicated that the office of

then Senator Hubert H. Humphries may have been instrumental

in having the contract awarded to Universal.

YOUTH PRIDE, INC.

FRAUD AGAINST THE

GOVERNMENT

the Department requested we review subpoenaed records of

violation of Fraud Against the Government Statutes. Grand

jury began hearing witnesses March 10, 1969.

CHROMCRAFT, CORPORATION: ET AL.

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

We conducted an extensive investigation in this case

• of a multimillion dollar fraud scheme in which "paper" corpora-

tions were formed to act as subcontractors

the production of rocket launchers for the go necylon lions

of dollars in overcharges to the Navy were channeled by subjects

into Swiss bank accounts. On August 7, 1968,

two corporations

and four individuals, including Francis Rosenbaum, a Washington,

D. C., tax attorney, were indicted in Washington, D. C., on

charges of conspiring to defraud the Government of more

than

$4 million. Trial date is set for September 8, 1969. On

January 29, 1969, civil suits were filed in Federal courts in

Captioned investigation concerns theft ring operating at

John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. special

Prosecutor Daniel P. Hollman, Department of Justice Task force, IS

presenting evidence to Federal Grand Jury wherein 15 to 17 indictments

anticipated probably April 30, 1969. Organized Crime Section of the

Department of Justice and Attorney General Mitchell particularly interested.

In October, 1968, four individuals, including Steinschreiber

and Mario Alessi, were arrested by the FBI in connection with theft of

drugs. Since that time, Alessi, a Pan American Airways cargo

supervisor, has been cooperating and named others in connection with

pharmaceutical thefts amounting to over $100, 000, as well as a series of

general merchandise thefts, such as furs, jewelry, and firearms

probably in excess of $250, 000 involved. Alessi has identified Raymond.

Wood, U. S. Customs Examiner, as being involved. Wood has been

interviewed, but denies complicity. Customs Agency has been apprised

of Wood's alleged involvement.

This Bureau has long been aware of the serious problems of

thievery at airports in the New York metropolitan area, particularly at

John F. Kennedy International Airport. Special Agents of this Bureau are

assigned on the scene at that airport and are actively handling investigations

of violations within our jurisdiction. In performing our duties, we enjoy

close working cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, with

the airlines, and with the Airport Security Council formed in 1968 to

cope with these problems.

BRIEF FOR DIRECTOR'S USE IN

OCONNECTION WITH ATTORNEY

GENERAL'S STAFF CONFERENCE

WEDNESDAYS, 5:00 P.M.

§timens

Reference is made to my memorandum of 3/13/70, submitting

a brief for the Director's use in connection with captioned conference. You

were advised this material would be edited each week to insure that it was in

a current status.

soul

There are attached amended pages 11, 12, 16, and 26 which

should be inserted in the briet.

102

The change on page 11 is under the subheading "Stock and

Bond Thefts," and the last sentence has been changed to reflect that the

amount recovered is now $8, 026, 000 and that 29 individuals have been

charged. The change on page 12 is the fact that the last sentence on the page

has been added to show that the United States Attorney in Baltimore, with

the approval of the Attorney General, plans to seek the indictment of

Congressman Dowdy and two others on 3/31/70. The change on page 16 is

in the first paragraph, reflecting that the Identification Division made an

identification in connection with the Wilkerson bombing in New York. It

also points out that Cathlyn Wilkerson and Kathy Boudin are among six other

fugitives being sought by the FBI after they failed to appear to answer local

felony charges in Chicago on 3/16/70 growing out of the October demonstra-

tions. The change on page 26 was made to include additional Laboratory

findings in regard to the Bel Air explosions i/

14;

In accordance with the Director's instructions, I attended the

captioned briefing which was commenced at 5:03 p.m. by the Attorney General who

introduced the Director and the Director thereafter briefed all attendees on the

work of the FBl. As the attendees arrived for the meeting I made available to each •

individual the bound FBI exhibit to which they could refer in following the Director's

presentation. There were 29 departmental representatives present at this staff

meeting. They were very attentive to the Director's presentation as indicated by

the many questions following the Director's discussion. When the Director was

providing the conference with the number of Negroes employed by the FBI, including

Agent and clerical breakdown, Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst interrupted the

Director and asked the Director to repeat these figures in order that he might

trecord them.

At approximately 5:25 p.m. the Attorney General left the room to

receive a telephone call. The Director questioned Deputy Attorney General

Kleindienst as to whether he should continue or wait for the Attorney General's

return. Mr. Kleindienst suggested the Director wait until the Attorney General

returned.

Mr. Kleindienst asked the Director concerning his references to the

volume of civil rights work - whether this included both civil and criminal investiga-

tions handled by the FBI under the Civil Rights Statutes and the Director replied

in the affirmative.

Mr. Kleindienst then referred to the number of organized crime type

cases the Director said are pending prosecutive action. He said are these all

organized crime individuals.

The Director replied they all have some connection

with the many facets of organized crime. The Director went on to say many of

these cases are"pending a year or two and he felt if we had swift prosecution and

substantial punishment a greater inroad could be made in removing the menace of

organized crime. Mr. Kleindienst then commented that he felt that some of the

problem here might be due to the resourcefulness of the organized crime subject's

attorneys. The Director replied that certainly this is true where such shysters

as Edward Bennett Williams represent these characters and he uses every technical

trick to avoid prosecution and conviction. The Director went on to say that Attorney

Kuntsler does the same thing in his field.

At this point, Wilson's Deputy, Petersen, of the Criminal Division,

took this opportunity to point out to Kleindienst that what is needed here are more

Assistant United States Attorneys, whereupon the Solicitor General added that

Federal judges were also needed.

Kleindienst then asked Petersen if he had studied

these cases and the reason for delay that Mr. Hoover referred to and Petersen

stated he did not have these figures at the end of his tongue but he had a survey

made and, as he recalled it, there were 185 of these type cases delinquent six months

or more. The others were delayed because of some court motion or action. The

Solicitor General asked whether there was any concentration of these cases and

Petersen said the Southern District of New York. Kleindienst then asked Petersen

how many Assistant United States Attorneys he needed to do the job and Petersen

said he could not give him a figure; however, he said he felt the District of

Columbia's, for example, staff could be increased by half again as many at least

and other appropriate increases would be necessary in major metropolitan

Mr. Hoover at this point, pointed out Senate Bill 30 is going to put

the FBI, if passed

I, into the local gambling picture and that we, in order to fulfill

our responsibility, Will probadly have to ask for an additional 600 Agents. He

pointed out that he hoped that the Criminal Division would draw up appropriate

guidelines to prevent local authorities from relinquishing their responsibilities

to also investigate local gambling.

At approximately 5:35 p.m., Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst

advised the conterence that the Attorney General was called to the White House

and requested the Director/proceed with the briefing. At approximately 5:55 p.m.,

the Director completed his briefing and was congratulated by the Deputy Attorney

General for the excellent presentation and the Deputy then opened the floor for

questions.

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Assistant Attorney General Leo M. Pellerzi, Administrative Division,

referred to the FBI exhibits and in particular Exhibit No. 25 and questioned

Mr. Hoover as to why the State of Virginia had such a high number of Laboratory

examinations. Mr. Hoover explained that Virginia had no Laboratory and that

that was the reason for the high usage of the FBI Laboratory. Mr. Hoover took

this opportunity to explain the FBI's policy in not making our experts available

when local experts have already examined the evidence or are going to testify as to

the evidence. He also explained there are many "phonies" who are traveling about

the country conducting examinations and testifying but we, in these cases, have

briefed the prosecuting attorneys in advance.

The Director explained that in such

places as New York State where they have their own Laboratories they only use

our Lab for the more sophisticated examinations.

Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst then questioned the Director as

to the basic qualifications for the position of Special Agent. The Director explained

that they all had to be either lawyers or accountants or college graduates majoring

in science or language. The Director emphasized again that we have no discrimina-

tion and that we have many fine Negro Agents in the FBI, pointing out that only last

week he gave a meritorious award to a Negro Agent from our Detroit Office who had

developed valuable informants in the Black Panthers and related organizations in

that area. Kleindienst then asked the Director approximately how many applicants

we turn down for each Agent that we accept. The Director explained that for every

100 applicants 90 of them are turned down.

He said that we carefully interview

these men, investigate them, test them, and give them thorough physical examina-

tions to make sure they meet our high standards. The Director told the conference

that he has a standing rule that if any Agent in Charge recommends an Agent or

clerk who is a hippie type; that is, long hair, sideburns, etc., this Agent in Charge

is going to lose his office, and we are going to get rid of the applicant. He said he

would not tolerate any hippie types in the FBI and do not want our Agents going into

Federal court looking like hippies.

The Director pointed®

out that many of our young clerical employees

are going on to school to become Agents, and he demands the same discipline of

these young peopie.

He also pointed out that some 6,000 people a day tour our

facilities and we don't want them getting the idea the FBI has any hippie types.

As a matter of fact, the Director sald with a smile that he would like to declare

open season on these hippies just like you have open season on the deer and shoot

them.

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Mr. Kleindienst was also interested in the scope of our work and in

this regard the Director took this opportunity to point out that he did not believe the

FBI should be investigating every bomb threat and that he hoped that if the new bomb

legislation as proposed by the President is passed the Department's Criminal

Division will set appropriate guidelines. The Director pointed out that many of

these major cities have very excellent bomb squads and they are fully equipped to

handle these complaints. He said why should the FBI be paralleling work done by

competent local authorities. He said, of course, in the local areas where they have

no people qualitied, then this is a different matter. The Director said in all of these

cases we are always willing to make our FBI Laboratory facilities and Identification

facilities available as well as assist the local authorities by covering out-of-state

Leads.

Assistant Attorney General Johnnie M. Walters asked the Director

if he could see any lessening of the problems that he talked about in the foreseeable

future. The Director said in the organized crime field, if the steps he has

recommended are taken, he feels there will be a decrease. With regard to the

disorders in colleges and in the high schools and caused by the militants he said

this is another story. The Director cited the incident of one of the subject's in the

Chicago Seven trial appearance last night at American University and thereafter

going to Catholic University and then leaving town. He said that apparently these

university administrators will not call in the local police, and he said it was dis-

graceful how they threw rocks, destroyed property and set fires at American

University. He then also cited the incident wherein attorney Kuntsler after he went

out to Santa Barbara, California, gave a speech, and then left town, that Santa

Barbara was the victim of three days of looting and burning. The Director cited

the violence promised in New Haven when Bobby Seale is brought to trial whereupon

the Solicitor General commented that the judge who is going to try that case was his

law school roommate. The Director said that this is a very serious situation and

it is entirely possible that violence will occur when Seale is tried. The Director

pointed out that we have appropriately advised all localauthorities of this possibility.

The Director then cited the tremendous problems that Judge Hoffman

in Chicago had in handling the trial and said that one could hardly blame him for some

of his actions in view of the provocative acts on the part of the subjects and the

attorneys. The Director said he recalled that Judge Medina in New York, when he

tried the Communist Party leaders, the experience was so trying that it actually

broke his health. Peterson at this point injected a comment that his people are

trying to find out whether in the New Haven Bobby Seale case the Panthers are

going to try to kidnap the Department's representative whose name is Lynch or

whether they are referring to the Attorney General of the State of California whose

name is also Lynch and the Director said he felt it was the Department of Justice

representative being referred to.

The Director took this opportunity speaking about retaliatory action

to point out that he was very concerned over the kidnapping of diplomatic officials

in South America and said he felt it would be repeated in this country. He hoped

the guard force for the embassies and chanceries in the Nation's Capital would be

promptly secured as the President is also very concerned about this.

In further reply to Mr. Walters question, the Director also pointed

out that he felt many of these college presidents needed to be more firm and take

drastic action by expelling these students from the school, not giving them amnesty,

and assisting the local prosecutors in prosecuting these people.

The Solicitor

General indicated that he also felt many of the faculty were also/contributing

factor to this problem. The Director agreed. The Director pointed out that these

student problems in the college or high school can be traced back to the parental

responsibility. The Director said that District of Columbia policemen have told

him that many young children are out on the street at all hours of the night and

their parents don't even know, and in some instances, care where they are. The

Director told them of the incident of where four of our Identification people were

held up and a female employee raped and how the juvenile giant when arrested had

a juvenile court record of four appearances without a single sentence and how the

Director had requested the court to try him as an adult but they refused to do so.

The Director referred to the fact that we have too many bleeding heart judges

and told of the success Judge Loble has had in Montana in handling juvenile subjects.

Memo J. J. Casper to Mr. M

hr 4/8/70

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference - 4/8/70 - 5 PM

George J. Reed, Chairman, Board of Parole, questioned Mr. Hoover

as to the extent of Communist influence in all of this New Left, Black Panther,

Students for a Democratic Society, and militant action that we are faced with.

The Director explained that the Communist Party will join anything that will

further its causes and that they get their orders directly from Moscow. He

said their influence in some organizations is complete control and in others

it is only one of participation but, he pointed out, they are always the most

vocal and, consequently, are very influential in those groups that they participate

in. He said the Black Panthers follow the philosophies of many international

revolutionary Communists. The Director then cited the incident of the young

girl who blew up her father's home in New York which she had turned into a

bomb factory. He stated she started to get out of control when at Bryn Mawr

she joined the Students for a Democratic Society, and now she has fled to

Canada and we are unable to extradite her.

At this point Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst thanked Mr. Hoover

for his outstanding presentation. He said he felt they all had a better knowledge

of the FBI and a greater appreciation of the many problems from a security and

crime standpoint facing our country. With that, the official part of the conterence

was adjourned. Many of the conferees came up and personally congratulated Mr.

Hoover and thanked him for his presentation, including asking Mr. Hoover to

autograph the FBI exhibit folder which had been passed out to each participant.

I feel this outstanding presentation on the part of the Director brought

great credit and praise for our organization. Hopefully, it will act as an incentive

to some of our counterparts in the Department to do a more aggressive job

in fulfilling their duies in meeting their security and criminal responsibilities.

Submitted for information.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY

HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE

MARCH 15, 1967

The "Washington Post" reported on March 16, 1967, that

Attorney General Clark opened hearings before a House Judiciary sub-

committee on March 15th relative to the Administration's request for

50 million dollars next year and 300 million dollars the following year

to assist state and local governments in modernizing their law enforce-

ment and corrective systems. Clark said that a successful war on

crime depends not on making it easier for police to seek confessions

but on improving their training and methods.

The Attorney General also said he had seen no evidence

that court decisions limiting admission of confessions had hampered

efficient law enforcement. Clark is reported to have opposed action

reversing court orders that suspects be told of their rights and be

offered counsel before being questioned.

Attorney General Clark said that since 1948 the FBI has

followed generally the same interrogation procedures which the courts

have now ordered the states to follow. The FBI has maintained a very

high average of convictions, showing "what excellence in training and

standards can do, " Clark said.

Clark also said he hoped Congress would not go "too far

on too little" until more evidence is in on the effect of the Supreme

Court's decisions.

COMMENT

The Attorney General failed to consider the fact that FBI

investigations are not normally hot pursuit, on-the-street situations.

When the FBI interrogates a suspect or subject, usually considerable

investigation has already been conducted and corroborative facts have

been developed which greatly assist the course of the interrogation.

On the contrary, police are frequently faced with fast-moving,

developing situations on the street where there is no opportunity for

the orderly accumulation of facts to supplement interrogation.

Congress is currently investigating the effect of the

Miranda decision on law enforcement and public safety. Senator

Birch Bayh (Democrat - Indiana) has been holding hearings around

the country regarding Miranda; however, testimony he has received

has been conflicting. Generally law enforcement officials testify

that they have been handcuffed and defense lawyers and civil liber-

tarians take the opposite view. As of this time, neither side has

demonstrable statistical proof to substantiate its contentions. The

absence of clear proof is due, at least partially, to the fact that

Miranda is a new decision being handed down on June 13, 1966.

As of now there are few reported court decisions showing how trial

courts will interpret the requirements laid down in Miranda.

PRESS RELEASE OF MARCH 15, 196%

ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN'S "WEDNESDAY CLUB"

ENTITLED "ARE WE ORGANIZED TO FIGHT CRIME?"

On March 15, 1967, a group of 21 generally liberal

Republican Congressmen, members of the "Wednesday Club, " issued

a press release challenging the adequacy of the Federal Government's

organization to fight crime effectively and called for expansion of the

House Judiciary Committee's hearings considering crime legislation

to examine this aspect of the war on crime. The gist of their argument

is that a reorganization of Federal law enforcement and investigative

agencies is needed to effectively carry on the war against crime. The

press release suggests that there is "confusion, competition and dupli-

cation" among Federal law enforcement and investigative agencies which

is hindering the war against crime and that this can be eliminated only

through a complete reorganization of these agencies.

The entire argument of the "Wednesday Club" is based on

a false premise. Traditionally and historically, law enforcement in this

country has been the responsibility of local governments and states.

The Federal law enforcement agencies make only approximately 50, 000

arrests per year for Federal violations, while local and state police

make over six million arrests for criminal acts, not including traffic

offenses. Federal investigative agencies have very little jurisdictional

control over the more than three million serious crimes committed in

the United States in 1966. Reorganization of the Federal law

enforcement agencies is not the answer to the crime problem.

The

real problem is at the local level where there are 40, 000 investigative

agencies, ranging from city constables to state police, and the problem

of multiplicity of jurisdiction is within the state. From the standpoint

of the EBI, there is daily liaison and exchange of information with all

Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies; our important

cooperative services are made available to all law enforcement agencies,

both on the state and Federal lével; and the FBI's National Crime Infor -

mation Center is an example of the cooperation which exists among law

enforcement agencies on all levels.

The press release of the "Wednesday Club" states that

the FBI maintains an informal semi-autonomy from Administration

oculation, a hue organizationy rent desible to the Department

procedures. This statement is without any basis in fact. The Director's

testimony before various legislative committees, as well as documenta-

tion produced by him in the recent "wiretapping" controversy, clearly.

shows that the F'Bl's use of wiretaps was done with the specific knowledge

and approval of the Attorneys General and under strictly controlled

conditions.

There is no exercise of autonomy whatsoever. by the FBI

in this field.

The press release also charges that the FBI's involvement

in the foreign intelligence field, such as the Dominican crisis in 1965,

could detract from its domestic law enforcement and crime detection

functions. This allegation also is factually unsupportable. FBI Agents

were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1965 at the specific order of the

President; only three Special Agents are presently there, functioning

solely in a liaison capacity; statistical accomplishments by the FBI during

this period have been at their highest levels.

The action of the 'Wednesday Club" was an obvious

attempt to secure a headline, which they incorrectly feel they have

found in the question of Federal organization.

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

Attorney General Ramsey Clark was the guest of CBS program

"Face the Nation" which was telecast in Washington over WTOP-TV, at

12:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Sunday, March 12, 1967. This program

was moderated by CBS newscaster Martin Agronsky assisted by correspondents

George Herman of CBS and James Clayton of the "Washington Post."

The principal topics discussed during this interview of the

Attorney General were:

I. The New Orleans investigation into the

assassination of former President Kennedy; 2. Wiretapping; 3. The

Supreme Court "Miranda" decision; 4. Congressman Ádam Clayton Powell;

and 5. The death penalty.

Several references were made to the Director and the FBI

during this interview and all were favorable.

NEW ORLEANS INVESTIGATION

The Attorney General expressed his confidence in the

Warren Commission conclusion, based on FBI investigation, that assassin

Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing former President Kennedy. He

commented that most--if not all--of the individuals mentioned in the New

Orleans investigation were known to the FBI, which developed no evidence

that they were involved in the assassination. Clark declined to comment

on the mysterious individual known as "Bertrand" since New Orleans

authorities were then holding court proceedings to determine his identity.

WIRETAPPING

Clark commented that there were 38 wiretaps presently

authorized by his department, and that all of these were in national

security-type cases. He emphasized that procedares for his authority

in the use of all such devices have been improved, and he was satisfied

that none would sat be used without his approval.

"MIRANDA" DECISION

The Attorney General remarked that it was still too early

to determine what effect this decision would have on law enforcement

performance. He noted, however, that it has had no appreciable effect

on FBI investigations which have for many years informed suspects of

their constitutional rights prior to interrogation.

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

POWELL

No decision has been reached by the Department concerning

possible Federal violations committed by Powell, according to Clark.

However, he expressed the hope that their determination might await any

further action against Powell by Congress.

DEATH PENALTY

The Attorney General stated he would recommend the

death penalty be abolished for certain Federal violations.

UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS

1966 PRELIMINARY ANNUAL RELEASE

On Wednesday, p.m., March 15, 1967, the FBI's

preliminary crime reports for 1966 were released to the press.

This report highlighted the fact that crimes of violence

were up 11%. There was a 9% increase in murder, a 10% increase

in aggravated assault, a 10% increase in forcible rape, and a 14%

increase in robbery. As a group, crimes against property increased

11% during 1966.

The sharpest crime increase was noted in the group of

cities having less than 10, 000 inhabitants. Crime in these cities

rose 14%. Large cities with over 100, 000 inhabitants had an average

increase of 10%, while crime in rural areas was up 7% and crime in

the suburbs rose 13%.

In the release dated March 15th the Director reiterated

the need for adequate firearms legislation, noting that there was a

23% increase in 1966 in serious assaults where guns were used. The

Director also highlighted the fact that six out of every ten murders

were committed with the use of a firearm. 71% of these murders

were committed with handguns, 17% with shotguns and 12% with rifles

or other type firearm.

This crime report release also indicated that in 1966

police arrests of adults for all'

criminal acts (excluding traffic

offenses) dropped 1%; however, arrests of persons under 18 years of

age increased 9%.

Our preliminary annual release also noted that nationally,

police solutions of crime index offenses averaged 25% and noted that

police solved 89% of murders, 72% of aggravated assaults, 65/ of

forcible rapes, 35% of robberies and 21% of property offenses.

CRIME LEGISLATION

The Congress is presently holding hearings with

respect to the President's request for crime legislation entitled

"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967."

This Act has its

basis in many of the recommendations of the President's Com-

mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.

The report of the Commission entitled "The Challenge of Crime

in a Free Society" was released February 18, 1967. The pro-

posed legislation would provide for a substantial financial aid

program to local and state law enforcement agencies for the

purpose of purchase of equipment, training, education and

research. It would also establish in the Department of Justice

an agency to administer the program headed by a Director of

Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Assistance. Depending

on how this new legislation would be administered within the

Department of Justice, it will have an impact and could conflict

with the FBI's long-standing cooperative services for local law

enforcement.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

By letter dated March 10, 1967, the Attorney

General requested FBI participation in a national conference

of local and state law enforcement administrators to be held

in the State Department Auditorium on March 28-29, 1967.

This conference was called by the President and has as its

purpose a discussion on how to implement the proposed

crime legislation. Since this conference and any new crime

legislation would affect directly the long-standing FBI coopera-

• tive services to local law enforcement, Assistant to the Director

DeLoach, Assistant Director Casper and Inspector Jerome J.

Daunt have been designated to attend. The Attorney General is

being advised by letter dated March 17, 1967.

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a

computerized index of law enforcement information on crime and

criminals, successfully began its pilot test operation on January 27,

1967. At the present time the following police agencies are directly

on-line to the FBI computer:

Boston Police Department

Philadelphia Police Department

New York City Police Department

Washington, D. C., Metropolitan Police Department

Chicago Police Department

St. Louis Police Department

New Orleans Police Department

Maryland State Police

Virginia State Police

Georgia State Patrol

Texas Department of Public Safety, and

N. Denver FBI Field Office

These agencies are entering records on wanted

persons, stolen motor vehicles, and identifiable stolen property.

They are receiving replies to inquiries in a matter of seconds.

For example, a police officer on the street in New Orleans through

the use of his car radio is able to get information from the FBI

computer here in Washington within 1 1/2 minutes. The California

Department of Justice and the New York State Police are scheduled

to join the NCIC system on March 20, 1967. The system has had a

steady growth in building up the information that is stored in the

computer, increasing the number of hours that the computer is

"on the air" and in adding new participating police agencies.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

BY NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JAMES Co GARRISON

In December, 1966, we received information that New Orleans

District Attorney James C. Garrison was conducting an investigation

of the assassination of the late President Kennedy. Garrison reported-

ly was attempting to develop evidence showing that David William

ferrie, a homosexual who was a tormer airlines pilot, and lee Harvey

Oswald

conspired with anti-castro Cubans to assassinate President

Kennedy•

We were informed by several sources that Garrison was basing

much of his investigation upon information furnished to him by Jack S.

Martin and David Lewis. Martin is a private investigator in

New Orleans and Lewis is a baggage handler at a New Orleans bus

station.

Both Martin and Lewis appear to be mental cases. During

our investigation of the assassination, we thoroughly investigated

allegations that Ferrie and Oswald were acquainted but we found

no evidence to show this was true.

Garrison has made one arrest in his case - Clay L. Shaw,

a homosexual who was former Director of the International Trade Mart

In New Orleans.

Shaw's name did not come up during our investigation

of the assassination.

Garrison claims Shaw is identical with one

Clay Bertrand, an alleged contact of New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews.

We never located Bertrand and Andrews® acquaintance with Bertrand

highly doubted, We developed no information indicating Oswald knew

Clay Shaw.

On March 14, 1967, during a preliminary hearing in New Or-

leans for Shaw, Garrison produced a mystery witness Perry Raymond

Russo who alleged that he was present at a meeting when Leon Oswald,

David Ferrie and Clay Shaw planned the assassination of President

Kennedy• Russo identified Leon Oswald as identical to Lee Harvey

Oswald.

Russo admitted receiving psychiatric treatment since 1959

and his testimony at the preliminary hearing was highly contradictory

to information he previously-furnished to news media.

Russo appears

to be lying and during our investigation of the assassination, we

developed no information indicating Oswald ever knew Russo.

• James C. Garrison is an egomaniac, is politically ambitious

and it appears his whole investigation was triggered by his desire

for publicity.

The Director has instructed that we have no contact

with Garrison

or any member of his staff and that we stay meticulously

out of Garrison's investigation.

It appears Garrison is looking for

an attempt to dump his investigation on this Bureau and the Director

has instructed that we should avoid such possibility "like a plague."

SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

The field of education has long been a major

target of the Communist Party. The communists'

emphasis

on students in the recent past was best expressed by

the Party's General Secretary, Gus Hall, when he stated

"Communism is big, really big, on college campuses now.

You've got to play the ball game where the players are and

the really good players are in college." Today there is

considerable unrest and agitation on college campuses

throughout the Nation.

Subversive agitators constitute the

major source behind this unrest and, from a long-range

viewpoint, these campus subversives may well become seriously

damaging to our national security. In light of this, the

FBI will continue to carry out its defined responsibilities,

whether they be on the college campus or elsewhere, while

at the same time respect the spirit of academic freedom on

which our college system is based.

The two major student and campus groups in the

United States today are the communist-inspired W. E. B.

DuBois Clubs of America, with an approximate membership of

425 members, and the Students for a Democratic Society, with

approximately 5,000 members.

The Students for a Democratic

Society has been described by Gus Hall as a new left group

which the Party has "going for us."

Today there is a concerted effort on the part of

student groups to "knock" the FBI and other Government

agencies off the college campuses and to prevent such

agencies from carrying out their assigned duties.

For

example, in early March, 1967, a handful of Students for

a Democratic Society members at Duke University, Durbam,

Vorth Carolina, alleged that the FBi in conducting investi-

gations on that campus was infringing on academic freedom

by securing information from responsible campus officials

and students.

While we have interviewed officials and students

at the University in matters within our jurisdiction the

charges that the

FBI was infringing on academic freedom are

baseless

¿ Another example involves allegations made by a

group of "liberal" faculty members at State University College,

Brockport, New York. This group alleged that the FBI was

having faculty members "spy" on other faculty members, again

raising the cry of infringement of academic freedom.

These

charges also were baseless and without foundation.

TRAVEL OF THE PRESIDENT TO URUGUAY

At the request of the White House, a representative

of this Bureau

recently traveled to Uruguay and participated

in briefings, surveys, and discussions relating to security to

be provided for the President when he attends the Summit

Conference of heads of American States to be held in Punta

Del Este, Uruguay, during the period 4/12-14/67.

The same

Bureau representative is returning to Uruguay to assist a

White House group in the implementation of security measures

prior to the President's arrival. A general assessment of

the situation in Uruguay at the present time indicates that

adequate security can be provided to the President if he

restricts his travel to Punta Del Este.

If he travels to

Montevideo proper, security problems could arise because of

a very militant Communist Party which already is manifesting

its protests to the President's visit.

The Communist Party

in Uruguay practically controls the labor movement and

potentially is in a position to paralyze facilities such as

light, gas, water, and street transportation.

Furthermore,

there is a

good potential for committing sabotage and inciting

riots.

Under the present plan, the resident will not go

into Montevideo proper:

Security problems at Punta Del Este

are greatly minimized because the geographic location and

the resort-type atmosphere do not present any serious

obstacles for instituting good security.

The police and

security services in Montevideo are not efficient by our

standards, and it will take continuing prodding to make

certain that the necessary security measures are carried

out.

The political stability of the Uruguayan Government is

not

good. There is a new Government which is shaky and is

suffering economic problems.

There have been a series of

strikes during the last several weeks. We have been told

that there will be between 1500 and 2500 newspapermen who

will attend the conference.

There may be some commotion

among them because of inadequate housing and communication

facilities. Newspaper reporters may also find it disappointing

to find any news of real significance at Punta Del Este if

there are no disturbing incidents.

WIRE TAPS AND OTHER COVERAGE UTILIZED IN THE

INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

Wire taps are utilized only in the internal security

field and when absolutely essential to carrying out our

investigative responsibilities.

Their number varies and

of this date we have 42 wire taps in operation. In addition,

JEK Act 6 (4)

The importance of utilizing wire taps in the internal

security .field. cannot be overemphasized in view of the dangers

that exist in the internal security of the United States.

The

intelligence data obtained from such coverage makes it possible

to keep appropriate officials of our Government currently

aware of the activities, plans, strategy, and tactics of

individuals.

Also, intormation

gathered from these sources is of immediate interest to the

United States intelligence agencies and officials of the Govern-

ment in the formulation of plans in the foreign policy field.

We are not utilizing any microphone surveillances,

mail covers, or trash

covers

in connection with our investiga-

tions. We are utilizing security informants and confidential

sources to provide

necessary coverage.

Currently, we

have

das security informants who are members of the Communist Party

and some of these are operating at the highest level. In view

of the valuable coverage these informants provide us, we place

great deal of emphasis on their utilization. It may be

interesting to note that during Mashed of our security infor

mants became members of the Communist Party and this was

increased to us informants becoming members of the Party in

In this connection, we noted that during those two years while

informants became members of the Party, # discontinued

their association with the Party primarily due to personal

reasons, thus leaving us a total gain of du informants in the

Party.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

The Connunist Party, USA, is operating in an

atmosphere of optimism as a result

of the March 3, 1967,

decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Washington, D.C.,

which stated that the Party could not be forced to register

under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950.

The feeling throughout the Party is that it has won its fight

for existence and now must move to capitalize on this victory

by becoming an effective force on the American scene.

Within this week the Party adopted various programs

in an effort to move out of its isolation from the American

people. It is working toward the establishment of a daily

newspaper which is expected to be in operation in time to

have an effect on the national elections in 1968. Originally,

the Party planned to merge peace, labor, and civil rights

groups into a new political party which

would nominate a

candidate for President of the United States in 1968.

Now,

the Communist Party is seriously considering running its own

candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of

the United States in 1968.

May 1, 1967, is to mark the institution of a

massive recruiting drive by the Party to take advantage of

the favorable Court decision and each Party district is being

instructed to start making plans for this recruiting drive

now.

In addition, Party leaders have called for more infil

tration by Party members into the trade union movement in

an attempt to regain the power the Party had in this movement

in the 1940's.

The Party believes that youth must be the central

concentration for its work in the future.

In order to have

the most impact on the young generation and to gain recruits

quickly, the Party must make an effective appeal to youth.

Therefore, it is instituting a massive campaign against

United States policy in Vietnam,

instituting resistance to

the military draft, and encouraging all types of demonstrations

by youth.

The Party also will start a movement to have Congress

pass a bill guaranteeing full employment for all youth.

"The Party considers recruiting of youth its most

important project in 1967. Current plans call for doubling

the number of youth in the Party during the Summer of 1967,

and the nationwide establishment of Party schools to fully

indoctrinate these youth recruits in the principles of

Marxism.

DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES

INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM

Since United States aircraft attacked selected

argets in North Vietnam tollowing torpedo-boat assaults

gainst destroyers in the Gulf/Tonkin in early August.

1964, there have been in the United States almost daily

demonstrations to protest United States intervention in

Vietnam.

Many of these demonstrations have reached major

proportions.

The Communist Party and other subversive groups

such as the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America, a communist

inspired Marxist-oriented youth group; the Socialist Workers

Party, which has been designated as subversive by the Attorney

General, and its. youth affiliate, the Young Socialist Alliance;

the Workers World Party, a communist splinter group and its

youth affiliate, Youth Against War and Fascism; and the

Progressive Labor Party, a pro-Chinese Marxist group, have

actively supported and

participated in demonstrations along

with the Students for a Democratic Society, a militant youth

group which has been described by Gus Hall, General Secretary

of the Communist Party, USA, as a group which the Party has

"going for us."

Pacifist groups such as Women Strike for

Peace, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,

the Committee for Nonviolent Action, and the National Committee

for a Sane Nuclear Policy have also taken a leading role in

sponsoring sụch demonstrations.

Summaries showing the

highlights of these demonstrations are furnished to the

White House and other Government officials two or three times

a week.

The Spring Mobilization Committee and the Student

Mobilization Committee, both of which include members of the

Communist Party and other subversive groups in their

membership, are sponsoring demonstrations throughout the

United States April 8-15, 1967.

The focal point of the

week-long activity will be massive demonstrations at

New York City and San Francisco, California, on April 15.

The Reverend James Bevel is the National Director of the

Spring Mobilization Committee. Bevel is an official of the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a civil rights

group which

is headed by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Student

Mobilization Committee is the brainchild of

Bettina Aptheker, a student at the University of California

at Berkeley and

a member of the Communist Party, USA, National

Committee. An attempt is being made to have 500 individuals

burn their draft cards at New York City during the demonstration

on April 15, 1967, as a mass protest against the war and the

draft.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be

used in preventing communists from gaining control in that

country. At the height of the Dominican Revolution, we had

a staff of 14 Agents.

In August, 1966, at White House

instructions, we established a permanent Legal Attache office

there staffed with three Agents.

Since his inauguration July 1, 1966, Dominican

President Joaquin Balaguer has brought about a degree of

stability, however, there continues to be strong undercurrents

of dissension. • The

rightists reportedly have considered

plots to remove Balaguer.

Juan Bosch's political party, the

loser in the June, 1966,

election, has been most vocal in

its opposition to

Balaguer's programs and only recently

published

a document which appears intended to set the

stage for a vast movement of resistance against Balaguer.

communist groups have

suffered much internal dissension

but to establish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have

in the past. They possibly would be willing

to let

Bosch's

political

party provide the overt leadership.

(Section 956, Title 18) makes it a violation to conspire in the United States

to damage property owned by a foreign government in a foreign country.

To successfully prosecute under Section 956, it must be

proven that the conspiracy originated in the United States. No violation

would exist if the conspiracy originated in Canada even if subsequent

discussions and other overt acts occurred in the United States. It is

unlikely that this point can be established unless a confession is obtained

from one of the conspirators. Alvey is making every effort to develop

the necessary evidence on this point in examining witnesses before the

grand jury and has laid the groundwork for possibly forcing testimony

from one or more prime suspects by offering immunity coupled with

a threat of contempt proceedings if testimony is withheld.

Trial attorney Alvey has indicated the grand jury is

enthusiastic but he does not expect to obtain a true bill unless additional

evidence is developed to prove the conspiracy to bomb the Canadian

establishments originated in the United States. We are vigorously

• pursuing all logical possibilities to develop such information by

continuing investigation.

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

Hoffa and three others are presently serving

prison terms as

a result of their conviction in Chattanooga

Federal Court 3/4/64, on charges of obstruction of justice.

The only legal issues presently pending are two motions in

the Circuit Court of Appeals, Cincinnati, on which

arguments were heard 2/7/6%,

and a motion for new trial

Illed in U. s. District Court, Chattanooga, 2/28/6% alleging

the Government's use of wire tapping and electronic

eavesdropping against Hoffa, his attorneys, and others.

These charges, so far as the Bureau and its personnel are

concerned, are completely false and the Government filed

its response to this motion on 3/10/67. The Chattanooga

court is expected to rule on this motion in the near

future. Although Hoffa is now in prison, his attorneys

have continued unsuccessfully to shop around the U. S.

Supreme Court in an effort to have one of the Justices

release Hoffa on bail pending disposition of the pending

motions.

ROBERT EARL BARNES

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTAMON OF STOLEN PROPERTY

Robert Earl Barnes is the notorious burglar with

an extensive arrest record who was the main witness at the

trial in District Court of 5 policemen charged with bribery

and conspiracy.

Trial,

which ended March 11, 1967, resulted

in the conviction of 3 District of Columbia

police

officers

and the acquittal of the other 2.

Barnes has admitted to our Agents the theft on

June 12, 1964, of a 34.10 carat diamond ring (appraised at

$120,000) from Mrs. John R. McLean, a guest at the

Lucayan Beach Hotel, Grand Bahamas Island. The diamond ring

was transported by

Barnes and an associate to New York City

where it was sold. Some of the evidence has been presented

to a Special Federal Grand Jury, however, prosecution of

Barnes for the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property

violation was held in abeyance pending completion of the trial

of the police officers.

On March 13, 1967, Assistant U. S. Attorney Harold I.

Sullivan, who is handling this matter, advised that it was the

specific instruction of U. S. Attorney David Bress that prosecution

of Barnes in connection with the McLean diamond should be

pursued and pertinent witnesses are to be called before the

Grand Jury.

This is being followed most closely.

BOMBING DEATH OF

WHARLEST JACKSON

AT NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1967

CIVIL RIGHTS

BOMBING MATTERS

A full investigation is being conducted at the Depart-

ment's request concerning the death of Wharlest, Jackson at Natchez,

Mississippi, as a result of a bomb exploding in his pickup truck as

he left work at the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Company in Natchez

shortly after 8 p.m. on February 27, 1967..

Jackson had been employed by the Armstrong Company

since June, 1955. On February 20, 1967, he bagan training for a new

job as a cement mixer, a type of position previously held only by white

men. His particular job was a new position and was based on seniority.

Jackson had held the position of treasurer in the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People in the Natchez branch and is

survived by his wife and five children. George Metcalf, a Negro fellow

employee, also active in the National Assocation for the Advancement

of Colored People, who previously customarily rode to work with

Jackson, was seriously injured in a similar type explosion in 1965.

• On the scene examination by Laboratory experts

indicates that a high-order explosive was detonated under the cab portion

of Jackson's truck directly beneath the driver. Fragments of wire

recovered at the scene appear to be wire from an electric blasting

cap, indicating that such a cap may have been connected to and

activated by the electric wiring system of the truck. Portionsof the

• wires to the brake light;

tail light, and left rear turn indicator light,

which were originally located on the inside of the left frame, are

missing as a result of the explosion. No additional physical evidence

has been disclosed to date.

Extensive investigation conducted under the on-the-scene

supervision of Inspector Joseph A. Sillivan indicates that a group known

as the Silver Dollar group is responsible for the bombing. The Silver

Dollar group is reportedly a secret group of Mississippi and Louisiana

Klansmen founded in June, 1965. One informant is presently a member

of the group but to date has been unable to establish the identity of

2.44

persons responsible for the bombing. Intensive efforts are being

made to develop additional sources to furnish further penetration of

the group and to trace the electric blasting cap probably used to

detonate the explosive.

as a result of his having testified falsely before the

On March 25, 1965, in response to request of

Criminal Division, Bureau monitored telephone calls from

Bromley to Jones

and Baker. Bromley and his attorney had

asked that this be done.

Department held such monitoring

would be legal.

On March 26, 1965, Department requested

we monitor meeting to be attended by Jones, Bromley, and

Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles.

Purpose of meeting was

to get Bromley, a Government witness, to tailor his

testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given.

Bureau

declined

to monitor this meeting because of lack of security

of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure

of the coverage.

Department then got Bureau of Narcotics

to assist in monitoring of the meeting.

Recently we have responded to Department's request

regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones.

Such coverage

involved twenty conversations over four las Vegas and one

Miami electronic device. All conversations were inconsequential

and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones.

This

coverage will be subject matter of

future pretrial proceedings.

tion for the Advancement of Colored People, Forrest County,

Mississippi, was shot into and completely gutted by fire.

Dahmer died the afternoon of the same date in a Hattiesburg,

Mississippi, hospital.

Extensive around-the-clock investigation conducted

by the FBI resulted in the indictment of 15 members of the

White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on June 22, 1966.

The

indictment charged these Klansmen with violation of the

Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights Statutes. Those

inaicted included sam holloway Bowers, Jr. Imperial

wizard

of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi.

A motion was filed on behalf of 13 of the defendants

to dismiss this indictment based upon an objection to the

array of the jurors.

Based upon this action the facts were

re-presented to a Federal Grand Jury at Jackson, Mississippi,

which resulted in the indictment of 12 members of the White

Knights of the Ku Klux Klan' of Mississippi on February 27, 1967.

murders.

These indictments were dismissed October 7, 1966,

on legal

REQUEST OF ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

VINSON, MARCH 14, 1967, RE LAKE COUNTY,

INDIANA, CRIME CONDITIONS

Assistant Attorney General Fred M. Vinson, Jr.,

Criminal Division, requested preparation of an extensive summary

crime condition report concerning Lake County, Indiana. He asked

for information on gambling, racketeering, counterfeiting, narcotics,

shoplifting and other such matters. By letter to the Attorney General

on March 16, 1967, we pointed out we no longer make such reports

and our commitments preclude the preparation of such a study. This

is apparently a 'fishing expedition" type request for Vinson's and

Petersen's Task Force. We advised them they have reports in

gambling and racketeering-type cases in Lake County, Indiana, where

recent prosecutive action has been taken against hoodlums.

The Department has embarked on a Crime Task Force

Program which solicits the active participation of the various Federal

investigative agencies. We informed the Department that there are

inherent drawbacks to such a program and are not actively partici-

pating in it. We have, however, advised the Department that if

matters within our jurisdiction arise during the Task Force Program,

we will handle such upon referral of these matters to us. We have

also agreed to conduct an indices and credit check of grand jury panel

in the Buffalo area, which is to be convened for the Task Force in

operation in that area.

Department attorney Peloquin advised a Canadian police

official that the FBI was participating in a 'buy back"' of United States

Postal Money Orders and we directed a letter to the Attorney General

on March 8, 1967, pointing out that Peloquin had misinformed the

Canadian authorities on our participation.

WIRETAPPING

The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary

Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone and wiretapping

were unnecessary in connection with control of crime in the United

States. Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to

legalize such practices are pending in the Congress. We directed a

letter to the Department dated March 6, 1967, concerning legislation

proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and

use of microphones with court approval in organized crime investiga-

tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would

be very beneficial to our efforts in the field of organized crime and

would appear to provide a statutory basis for practices now being .

followed in connection with use of such devices in national security

matters. Microphones were of inestimable value in determining

La Cosa Nostra weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves,

and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa-

tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Cosa

Nostra sources of income.

In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior

microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals

courts, there has been to date no complete reversal of any of such

cases which were actually brought to trial. In several cases, notably,

Kolod-Alderisio in Denver, Colorado; Robert G. Baker in Washington,

D. C. ; Frank Peter Balistrieri in Springfield, Illinois; Charles

Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami,

Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each

instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our

position that these cases were not tainted. In the Black case and in

the Schipani case in New York; the Supreme Court has remanded for

retrial and these are still under consideration.

GAMBLING CASES

In our gambling cases, we have already recorded a total

of 78 convictions thus far this fiscal year, which represents 30 more

convictions than at a similar time last year. In addition, we have in

excess of 350 individuals arrested and/or indicted and awaiting trial

for violations of these statutes. As a result of our dissemination

policies of gambling information to local authorities, we have directed

telling blows against La Cosa Nostra members active in this field by

virtue of numerous arrests made by local authorities.

During this fiscal year we have disseminated 159, 823

items of criminal information to local authorities, which is an increase

of 50, 000 items over this same period last year.

of Interest) on the part of Senator Dodd. These investi-

gations were conducted at the specific request of the

FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY

LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1965

The 79th Session of the FBI National Academy begins

Monday, March 20, 1967. There will be 100 law enforcement

officers in attendance with representatives from 45 states, the

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 7 foreign officers from

5 foreign countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Malaysia and

Thailand). (The Attorney General presented diplomas to the

graduating class of the 75th Session of the National Academy on

May 26, 1965, when he was Deputy Attorney General.)

On January 25, 1967, the Director sent a memorandum

to then Acting Attorney General Clark requesting that National

Academy representatives be included under the Law Enforcement

Assistance Act of 1965 as soon as possible for financial assistance

in helping to defray living expenses while attending the FBI

National Academy. We referred Mr. Clark to previous correspondence

on this same matter and a reply dated August 24, 1966, that

indicated that such support would be appropriate under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act.

The Director pointed out that while

we anticipate having a continuing demand and desire to attend this

Academy, we do not feel this factor should have a bearing on the

allocation of funds under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act.

It was assumed in the Attorney General's reply in August, 1966,

that in view of the current limited capacity of the Academy plus

the ample demand and desire of local agencies to send candidates

it would be unnecessary at this time to be concerned about sub-

sistence aid.

It was estimated that approximately $80, 000 for

subsistence and travel would be needed for the March class and

that it would vary somewhat for each class and that if the Acting

Attorney General approved this concept, the Director stated a

request for a grant would be submitted on proper documents to

the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance.

We have never received a reply to this memorandum

even though we pointed out that several grants under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act have been awarded for the conduct

of police seminars and have included funds for financial assistance

of the attendees. The Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General that we are not asking for this money for the

FBI but that the funds would be helpful to the agency sending the

man to the National Academy. Although we have not conducted

a nation-wide survey, we are aware that many departments do

not submit applications to the National Academy because they

do not have the funds to pay the living expenses of their officers

while they would be in Washington.

POLICE TRAINING

Assistance in training matters continues to be one of the

most sought after cooperative functions of the FBI. During calendar year

1966, the FBI assisted municipal, county and state law enforcement agencies

in 5478 training endeavors, attended by 163, 302 people. Over 1200 Special

Agents of the FBI are trained as police instructors, and during 1966, they

contributed 45, 383 hours of instruction time, free of charge, at police

training schools. Assistance is rendered in all types of schools, however,

special emphasis is being placed on police administration and management,

search and seizure, probable cause for arrest, due process in criminal

interrogation, laboratory matters, crime scene search, collection and

preservation of evidence, human relations in police management, and

police-community relations.

NEW FBI ACADEMY

In May, 1965, the Director submitted a proposal to the

Attorney General for the building of a new FBI Academy on the

Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia. This suggestion was

immediately endorsed by the President and the Attorney General.

The Director's proposal outlined that with the new facility, instead

of training 200 local law enforcement officers annually at the FBI

National Academy. we could train 1, 200 and up to 1, 000 local law

enforcement officers in specialized courses.

The Congress has

appropriated funds for the construction of this new facility.

The planning and engineering work on the site is in

progress and it is anticipated that the contract for the construction

of the Academy will be let sometime during the summer of 196%. It

is believed that the new Academy will be ready for occupancy during

fiscal year 1969.

EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM

Executive Order 11315 established an Executive

Assignment System for filling positions in Grades 16, 17, and

18 of the General Schedule. The FBI was specifically excluded.

The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super-

grade positions allotted to the FBI. An inventory of skills of

employees throughout the Government in Grades GS-15 through

18 is being established by the Civil Service Commission to fill

vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this

inventory all such employees, including those in the FBI. This

would make our executives available for consideration by other

agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider •

employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The

Department, therefore, was requested by letter dated December 21,

1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request-

ing exclusion of FBI executives from the proposed inventory as

retention by the FBI of its executives is considered essential. We

have been following with the Department but the matter has not yet

been acted upon by the Attorney General.

Rundquist and shergalis, which was shot down karch 21, 1960, while

trying to smuggle four cubans out of that country with resulting

arrest of Rundquist and Shergalis.

FBI source in Miami advised

March 22,

1960,

that incident was siaged py castro agents to proviae

Castro with. basis for renewed attacks against U.s, for allowing

illegal flights to cuco. On March 23, 1960, this hoax was exposed.

when shergalis gave statement to U.S. Embassy admitting role as

Castro agent and

implicating various cubans in U.s. and Cuba.

We

conducted intensive investigation in this matter and developed

substantial evidence showing that Rundquist shergalis flight was,

in fact, instigated by Castro agents.

Miami reports of April 1, April 6,

April 15, and lay 6, 1960, covering our investigation, have been

furnished to Department and other interested agenciese

bed bario soto runan Air faree employee at Miami mho served

as intermediary between shergalis and Cuban intelligence officials

charging them with violations of foreign Agents Registration ACt of

1930, as amended. Indictments were also returned against shergalis

and Runaquist charging violations of Federal Aviation Act, administered

by Federal Aviation Agency, for failure to file proper flight plar.

shergalis is still in custody of cuban officials in that country,

Cuban Government having rejected U. s. request that shergalis and

Rundquist be extradited to face charges in this country. at time

indictments were returned, Garcia was in Cuba and, therefore,

indictments were sealed and bench warrants were issued for arrest

of shergalis and Garcia.

Garcia returned to Miami on afternoon of May 4, 1960, ana

was arrested by our silom. Office at slami International airport.

Press release was issued SAl, diami, concerning arrest and subsequently

on same date Department issued press release concerning indictments

of shergalis, Garcia ana rundquist.

prior to indictments, Departmental Attorney Milliam

Air Force purchasing agent in Miami), Armando Jose Asencio

introduced him to cuban intelligence officials).

support prosecution of Hernandez Lopez, lillares and Fernandez

(Rodriguez. It appears there would se some substantial evidence

concerning Asencio's involvement, including his own admissions;

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR

MOTOR VEHICLES - FALSE REPORTS

SUMMARY OF PROSECUTIONS

The following is a summary of the prosecutions

under the false report section of the destruction of Aircraft

or Motor Vehicles Statute.

Attached hereto is a thumbnail sketch of each

of the cases which are pending

prosecution at this time.

Since the U. S. Attorneys' conference early in

April, 1960, prosecution has been authorized in 16 of these

cases. Arrests were made in 15 of these cases and in one

case, the subject Vincent Joseph Micel, Boston, Massachusetts,

was

permitted to surrender following the return of a true

bill of indictment. The Micel violation actually occurred

on January 26, 1960, and he was arrested by local authorities.

The Assistant U. S. Attorney, Boston, Massachusetts, deferred

his prosecutive opinion pending the outcome of local charges.

When local prosecution was subsequently discontinued, the

case was presented to the federal Grand Jury at Boston,

Massachusetts, on May 19, 1960.

There are also four cases pending in which

prosecution was authorized prior to April, 1960.

On May 19, 1960, Donald David Kitch, Portland,

Oregon, District Manager for Western Oil Company, who, on

May 12,

1960, made a false report while seeing his boss off

on a United Air Lines flight in Portland, Oregon, entered

a plea of guilty in U. S. District Court.

Sentence was not

imposed pending

the completion of a presentence investigation

and subject was

released on his own recognizance.

This

conviction brings the total number of convictions to 17 since

the effective date of this statute, July 14, 1956. These

convictions, with the exception of

the Kitch conviction, in

which sentence is not yet imposed, have resulted in 6 years

actual sentences, 10 years probationary sentences and $2, 750

in fines.

In summary, it is noted that convictions have been

obtained in 17 cases

and prosecution is pending in 19 cases.

a Trans World Airlines plane which had just departed irom New York

City that a bomb was aboard the plane, was indicted by Federal

Grand Jury at Newark, New Jersey, April 17, 1959.

Staff entered

a plea of not guilty and due to

a crowded court calendar, no

trial date has been set. This matter has been followed closely

with the U. S. Attorney and the Department and the potentially

adverse effect of the delay on successiul prosecution has been

pointed out.

At our specific request the Department instructed

the U. S. Attorney in late March, 1960, to seek an early trial

date in the matter. By letter April 27, 1960, the Newark Office

has advised that the U. S. Attorney has

been

attempting contact

with Staff's attorney, Congressman Cornelius E. Gallagher, in

order to arrange a trial date.

scheduled for April 21, 1960, and on that date his attorney filed

a motion to dismiss the information. On May 19, 1960, the

motion to dismiss the information was denied in

U. S. District

Court, Chicago, Illinois, and the case continued to June 16, 1960.

The desired records were

made available in South Carolina and Georgia.

In Louisiana a suit has been filed in Federal

Court against the Attorney General, Mr. Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr.,

and the Director of the FBI alleging Titles 3 and 6 of the

Civil Rights Act of 1960 are unconstitutional and requests

an injunction enjoining the Attorney General and the FBI

from proceeding under the Act.

Assistant

Attorney General Ryan and the Director to show

cause at 9:30 a.m., June 20, 1960, why preliminary inter-

locutory injunction should not be granted. Judge Dawkins also

signed a temporary restraining order to be effective until

June 20, 1960.

In Alabama, in one instance, an injunction has been

been referred to us by the Criminal Division for investigation

and 41 have been completed. Of the 3 cases received this week,

two had been forwarded to the Criminal Division by the

Department of Labor, which makes a total of 31 cases received

from the Criminal Division upon referral from the Department

ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY SUBCOMMITTEE

COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

ESTES KEFAUVER, CHAIRMAN

Recently Senator Kefauver's Committee requested

I the Bureau to conduct name checks on 304 individuals

reportedly associated with the boxing industry. Several

of these names were duplicated on a prior request for a

name check by Senator Kefauver's Committee. It appeared

that the Committee might be conducting a fishing expedition

by submitting such an extensive list:

matter was referred to the Department to answer the Committee's

request.

On May 25, 1960, William G. Hundley, Chief,

Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section, Criminal

Division, telephonically advised that following a contact

with the Kefauver Committee on that date the original

request for name checks on 304 individuals had been

reduced to a request for name checks on 30 individuals.

Of these 30, Mr. Hundley pointed out that where any

individual

was the subject of pending prosecution, such

as Frankie Carbo, it would be unnecessary for the

Bureau

to search its files concerning

; that individual.

Mr. Hundley

also advised the Committee representatives that it would not

be possible in every instance to make name checks on an

expeditious basis while the hearings were being conducted

inasmuch as the time factor in making the name checks would

depend upon the number of references involved.

Mr. Hundley

is sending a memorandum to the Bureau in the immediate •

future listing the names which the Conmittee has now

requested be checked.

Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley's memorandum listing

the names, the names will be checked and appropriate summaries

prepared. •

ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

1. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS ACT OF 1959 - FBI CANNOT

ABSORB ANY COSTS INCIDENT THERETO

The provisions of this new legislation, which was enacted by the

86th Congress, First Session, and approved by the President, become effective

July 1, 1960.

Its purpose is to provide health insurance for Federal employees,

annuitants, and their families. Employees will have the option of selecting from

four health plans with a wide range of benefits. The legislation provides that the

Government will contribute 50% of the premium cost of the plan selected, subject

to stated minimum and maximum ranges.

We cannot accurately estimate the cost to the FBI of these new

benefits until the Civil Service Commission has dealt with the insuring groups

to determine the cost of the plans and until the employees have selected the

desired coverage. Preliminary estimates, however, indicate an added cost of

approximately $1, 000, 000 per year to the FBI as the employer's cost of these

new benefits, based on the Bureau's experience derived from the operation of its

present health coverage plan.

The appropriation request of this Bureau represents an absolute

minimum figure. All avenues of possible savings were thoroughly explored in

arriving at the minimum figure requested. As a result, it will be impossible

for the FBI to absorb any part of the added cost resulting from the Federal

Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959.

2. ADMINISTRATION'S 2% SAVINGS PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR 1960

Budget Director Stans, in a letter dated September 21, 1959, to

the Attorney General, stated the President had asked him to request the continued

cooperation of the Attorney General in reducing civilian employment in the Govern-

ment. The letter pointed out that during the fiscal year 1959 executive agencies

effected a 2% reduction in employment and that the President would like to effect

a similar reduction in the fiscal year 1960, and requests the Attorney General to

give personal direction to the program and to plan his operations so as to accomplish

HH 55176

DocId: 32989646 Page 819

## Page 820

it. The reduction would be effected by not filling vacancies as they occur and

by not establishing new positions. The letter further directs that agency plans

for personnel reductions or facts as to why an agency head believes the requested

2% reduction is impracticable be presented to the Budget Bureau with the

October financial plan.

In connection with the 2% savings program in effect during the fiscal

year 1959, the Bureau advised the Attorney General that it would be impossible

to make any such reduction as the Bureau's operations were already on a "strict

austerity" basis.

The Department cut our fiscal year 1961 budget request by $400, 000,

reducing it from $117, 500, 000 to $117, 100, 000, thereby eliminating 45 employees

for the field (30 Special Agents and 15 clerks).

The Bureau is in no position to effect a 2% reduction in personnel

during fiscal year 1960. Our work loads in all categories continue to be heavy

with no sign of any abatement. Legislation enacted in the closing days of Congress,

specifically the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure. Act of 1959, will

further bolster our work volumes for which funds have not been provided and to

attempt to reduce our personnel by 2% would seriously impair this Bureau's

ability to discharge its responsibilities in all fields of work.

3.

SALARY RETENTION ACT, PUBLIC LAW 85-737

This act provides a two-year period of salary retention for employees

demoted through no fault of their own if they have occupied a higher paying position

for two years or longer. This act has caused a most inequitable situation by

requiring employees who accepted temporary promotions to be paid more than

permanent employees who are doing identical work. By memorandum dated

July 17, 1959, we urged the Department to recommend legislation so as to change

this situation at the earliest possible time. To date no legislation has been

introduced which would effect the desired correction of this inequitable situation.

INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

1. Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Public Law

86-257)

The new labor law, as above, became effective upon its signing

by the President on September 14, 1959.

The language in the Act conferred authority upon the Secretary of

Labor to conduct investigations of the majority of the provisions contained

in the law. Authority was also granted to the Secretary of Labor to enter

into agreements with other agencies to handle investigations.

The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice during September,

1959, has held conferences with officials of the Department of Labor for the

purpose of arriving at an agreement to be signed by the Departments of Justice

and Labor specifying those criminal provisions of the law, as well as the

prohibition against a member of the Communist Party holding office in a

labor union, which the FBI will investigate.

Preliminary conferences indicate investigative jurisdiction of the

following violations will be conferred upon the Bureau:

Embezzlement of union funds; payment by an employer of a fine

imposed upon a labor union officer; prohibition against communists and

convicted felons holding union office; picketing for extortion purposes;

deprivation by force or violence of rights of union members; and retention by

FBI of an amendment in the Act broadening the Labor-Management Relations

Act of 1947.

The finalizing of the agreement between the Departments of Justice

and Labor has not been effected. Until it is, we are not initiating investi-

gations without a specific request from the Department of Justice.

We have, however, received 85 specific requests from the Criminal

Division to determine whether certain convicted felons are holding office at

this time in labor unions in violation of that section of the Act (Section 504).

We have also received 52 names of individuals who are reportedly

labor union officials, from the Department, requesting a check of Bureau and

Identification Division files. Eighteen such name checks have been completed.

These were highly placed Teamster officials and trustees. We are not

processing the remaining 34 names until the Department provides us with

further identifying data as to the individuals.

2. FEDERAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION

Various proposals have been brought forth in the past

by individuals such as Senator Kefauver, Chief William Parker of

the Los Angeles Police Department, Milton Wessel of the Department,

and Senator McClellan for the establishment of a central Federal

clearinghouse of information on crime. More recently New York

State Attorney General Louis J. Letkowitz has proposed a clearing-

house of information concerning frauds on the consumer and

investor public.

Our position in the past has consistently been that there

is no need for such a clearinghouse and that the necessary and

desirable dissemination of criminal-type information is already

being accomplished within the framework, of existing law enforcement

structures.

Some of the serious objections to such a proposed

clearinghouse are that it would be an unwarranted intrusion of

the Federal Government into local affairs. There is the possibility

that such a clearinghouse would provide an official medium for the

dissemination of unverified data consisting of rumor and gossip

and that corrupt and irresponsible individuals would be presented

with the opportunity to use such information for purposes of blackmail

or extortion. In addition to the foregoing, the establishment of such

a clearinghouse would constitute a costly superstructure on already

existing facilities and could result in the establishment of a 'black

list" characterizing certain individuals as violators on the basis of

information not completely verified or authenticated.

The Bureau already disseminates on a daily basis

innumerable items of information to local, county, state and

Federal agencies. This information may not only relate to matters

over which we have jurisdiction but extends to any items which may

be of interest to other agencies. The channels for dissemination of

information are already established and the use of these channels by

all agencies would appear to obviate the need for any central clearing-

house of information.

3. NEED FOR CRIMINAL-TYPE LEGISLATION

Since April 30, 1958, the Bureau has suggested certain items

of legislation relative to establishing some effective curbs on the activities of.

racketeers. The most recent communication to the Department in this regard

was a memorandum to Deputy Attorney General Walsh dated September 29

1959, captioned "Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session. "

These legislative suggestions are as follows:

I There appears to be a need for legislation to prohibit the

interstate transportation of certain gambling paraphernalia, such as number

slips and punch boards in addition to the present prohibition of interstate

transportation of slot machines.

2. It also appears the interstate transmission of gambling

information should be restricted to prohibit the transmission of gambling

information in interstate or foreign commerce by any communication facility.

Such legislation should also encompass the transmission of information as to

the results of horse racing events until after a specified time had elapsed.

The inability to have current race results would discourage the operations of

bookmaking establishments.

3. Inasmuch as under the present provisions of the Internal

Revenue Code income derived from illegal businesses and from gambling

constitutes income which is taxable and assessed in the same manner as

legitimate income, it appears that if the income from such illicit sources were

taxed at vastly higher rates it might make such activities financially prohibitive.

nasmuch as certain individuals would attempt to avoid such taxes, it might

be desirable to initiate legislation to provide substantial criminal penalties for

the failure to pay such taxes.

4 It also appears legislation may be desirable to amend the

White Slave Traffic Act in order that the prostitute herself could be prosecuted.

There is considerable activity among those who are engaged in this livelihood

and who go from state to state in order to ply their träde.

5. As an added weapon against organized crime, it appears it

may be desirable to afford consideration to the enactment of a Federal habitual

criminal act which would provide for mandatory sentences upon the commission

of offenses within Federal jurisdiction.

In addition, the Bureau is in agreement with the Administration's

theory of amending the Fugitive Felon Act to include damage by fire or

explosives to religious or educational facilities. The House Judiciary Committee

has failed to approve this proposal and has adopted a bill (H. R. 8601) which would

prohibit damage to any building, structure, facility, vehicle or dwelling house.

HW 55176 DooId:32989646 Page 823

-5-

## Page 824

It is our view that such legislation should be restricted to cover educational

and religious tacilities only. This was called to the Department's attention

by the afore-mentioned memorandum dated September 2, 1959, captioned

"Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session. "

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

On March 12, 1959, the Director attended a conference in the Attorney

General's office in connection with current security programs and matters

collateral thereto. The Director expressed the view that security programs

had been held in abeyance in the Department of Justice with the result that

other agencies of the Government were taking advantage of such delays and

offering as excuses for nonaction the fact that the Department of Justice

had not yet indicated what should be done or should not be done in view of

some decisions of the courts and anticipated decisions of the courts. The

Director urged that basic action should be taken on certain of these programs.

While some of these matters have been acted upon, others are still pending and

are set forth below for the Director's information.

(1) Industrial Security Program - At the time of the March conference it

was decided to wait until the Greene and Taylor cases had gone through the

Supreme Court. This has now occurred and the Supreme Court has indicated

that there was not proper authority for an Industrial Security Program flowing

from the President or the Congress. The Court also strongly indicated that

even with such authority that there was a need for confrontation of witnesses

at such hearings. To meet this, the Administration is discouraging legislation

and approaching the matter through an Executive Order, two draits of which

have been examined by the Department and the Bureau.

The proposed Order

appears impractical in some respects and Yeagley of the Department has advised

us that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General do not like the Order as

drafted, particularly the "special counsel" concept and Deputy Attorney General

Walsh is being instructed to "bounce the Order back to the White House." By

letter dated September 30, 1959, to the Attorney Ceral, copies to Walsh and

Yeagley, the Bureau went on record that while we would attempt to live up to

any Order, the Department should carefully consider the position of the Department

and the Bureau under the proposed Order in that we would be forced to turn

down numerous requests to produce informants and sources for testimony or

interview in view of our overriding responsibility to protect their identities in

the interests of national security. This might open the Department and the

Bureau up to criticism that we were not living up to the spirit of the Executive

Order.

From the standpoint of the conference with the Attorney General on

October 6, we think the Bureau's position should be that the Industrial Security Pro-

gram problem should be settled either through Executive Order or legislation;

HH 55176 DocId:32989646 Page 825

-7-

---

## Page 826

Domestic Intelligence Division

that whichever means is used must be practical and not merely drawn up in

a visionary manner in an attempt to satisfy the Supreme Court but end up

by placing the investigative agencies in an untenable position because they

cannot comply with the spirit of the Order.

(2) Port Security Program - There has been no change in the Port Security

Program with the exception that Treasury Department has drafted proposed

legislation to enable the Coast Guard to subpoena and pay the travel expenses of

witnesses to appear at Coast Guard hearings.

Treasury has indicated this

bill is in the Bureau of the Budget. At the March 12, 1959, conference the

Director pointed out that positive action should be taken toward getting such

legislation and the confrontation issue should not be used as an excuse to scrap

the program because the FBI had supplied a substantial number of witnesses

who could appear and testify. The Bureau's position should be the same;

namely, that the wherewithal should be devised to carry forth the program instead

of scrapping it. It should be borne in mind that in Port Security hearings as

in many other security-type hearings the question of confrontation will continue

to be an issue and the pattern set by the Executive Order in the Industrial

Security Program will probably be applied to the other types of security hearings.

(3) Air Crewmen Screening Program - The Air Crewmen Screening

Program is a program proposed by ICIS to screen crews of United States planes

engaged in international flights and to screen all holders of Airmen's Certificates.

The ICIS also proposed the Federal Communications Commission Radio Screening

Program which would require the screening of all operators of radio transmitters.

To our knowledge, nothing has been done on either of these programs since the

March, 1959, conference with the Attorney General. While the FBI originally

concurred that these programs would be helpful, we have not pushed them,

believing this is a proper function of ICIS. It is believed the Bureau's position

should be that a decision should be reached as to whether these programs should

be implemented and they should not be allowed to hang fire on the basis that

they might not be agreeable or acceptable to the Supreme Court. In other words,

security programs should not be left in a status of hiatus because of pending

judicial decisions.

(4) Personnel Security Program - The March, 1959 conference discussed

the Personnel Security Program, particularly whether there should be legislation

to provide for an over-all security program which would cover both sensitive

-8-

НЫ 55176

DooId:32989646

## Page 827

Domestic Intelligence Division

and nonsensitive areas. This is still an undecided issue although several bills

have been introduced into Congress to remove the distinction between sensitive

and nonsensitive areas of Federal employment. Undoubtedly, the Greene

decision in the Supreme Court carrying the strong inference that confrontation

is necessary in security-type hearings has slowed up consideration of legislation

in this field by the Department. This is essentially a Departmental problem

and we feel the Bureau's position again should be that the Department should

meet these issues rather than coast along in a state of indecision.

(5) In the field of legislation involving security, by letter dated September 2,

1959, the Bureau proposed to Deputy Attorney General Walsh the following items,

which the Director might wish to point out to the Attorney General. While bills

were introduced into Congress on some of these items, legislation has not been

completed as to any of them.

(a) It is desirable that Title 18, Section 791, United States Code, be

amended to extend the jurisdiction of the

Federal courts over acts of espionage

against the United States wherever committed.

(b) Amendment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to clarify

and make more specific the definition of a "'Foreign Principal"' and to further

clarify the exemption to registration afforded business representatives.

(c) Legislation is suggested which would permit the Secretary of

State to consider security factors in the granting of passports; however,

appropriate provisions should be made to protect FBI informants and sources

in this connection. This matter is mentioned in the Bureau's memorandum

to Walsh dated May 26, 1959, regarding H. R. 7006.

(d) Another suggestion is legislation to strengthen the Smith Act of

1940 by defining the word "organize" and the word "advocacy." A definition

of "organize" was introduced as H. R. 2369 and as S. 1300. S. 1305 attempts

to define "advocacy."

(e) Legislation is needed which would prohibit former Government

employees from disclosing to unauthorized individuals certain information

obtained by them in the course of their employment.

(f) Legislation is needed to amend the espionage laws so as to

provide punishment for persons who gather and correlate data from legitimate

sources for transmittal to foreign governments.

Domestic Intelligence Division

(6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice,

as well as Government departments in general, to shy away from pursuing

logical courses of action in the security field rather than to implement necessary

security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate

decisions by the Supreme Court. The net effect of this is that the Supreme

Court is not required to meet these issues and render decisions and thus,

historically, to take responsibility for them. It is our feeling it is a far better

course of action to attempt to implement those programs necessary for our

national security and give ground grudgingly and only where forced to do so

so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to

carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner.

FBI BUDGET REQUEST - FISCAL YEAR 1968

The Bureau's request for 1968 totals $186,574,000. It will

provide for a personnel staff totaling 15,780 (6,638 agents and 9,142

clerks). The request makes provision for an increase of 569 full-year

employees (106 agents and 463 clerks) when compared to 1967.

Of the additional employees, 165 (100 agents and 65 clerks)

are for assignment to the field to assist in the handling of a heavy

volume of civil rights work. (This is the second increment of a

total increase of 300 agents and attendant clerical staff and

equipment previously ordered by the President for civil rights

work over a three-year period to be implemented at the rate of 100 agents

a year.) The remaining 404 employees (6 agents and 398 clerks) are for

assignment at our headquarters, the bulk to be utilized to handle the

tremendous increase in name and fingerprint checks being received.

The request of $186,574,000 for 1968 is an increase of

$4,249,000 when compared to the total requirements for the current

fiscal

year 1967 which includes $175,465,000 already appropriated

and by a supplemental request totaling $6,860, 000 brought about

by costs growing out of new legislation increasing our payroll

costs ($5,250,000) and by new legislation increasing the costs we

must pay to transfer employees to meet the needs of the service

($1,610, 000) .

Most careful consideration was given to our request for

additional personnel in 1968. We are absorbing much work and will

endeavor to make further absorptions. When confronted with a

one-million increase in fingerprint receipts, a 43% increase in

name checks, a heavy amount of civil rights and other work, we

have no alternative but to ask for additional manpower if we are to .

meet our responsibilities in these areas.

The Bureau's growing work is not limited to these particular

areas by any means. The work of the FBI Laboratory mounted to a new

all-time peak during the fiscal year 1966, numerous criminal classifi-

cations reached new highs, and our work in matters vital to the internal

security of the country has continued to increase. We are going to

do our best to handle the mounting work in these areas with our

existing staff. In addition, new items.of legislation continue to be

passed adding to our work.

Indicative of our heavy volume of work is the fact that as

of January 1, 190/, pending investigative matters throughout the

field totaled 150, 109, with J in a delinquent status. At that time,

the average individual assignment in the field was nearly 26 matters as

compared with 20 at that time in 1961.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE AND ORGANIZED CRIME SECTION

During the past few months the Department has

launched into a program of revier of past, current, and

contemplated prosecutions to determine if such cases have

been materially affected by the use of electronic listening

devices. This has required the establishment of special

microphone indices at Bureau Headquarters and voluminous

correspondence with various field divisions to determine if

individuals listed in the Department's inquiries were covered

by FBI microphones. Vith regard to listed individuals on

whom we have had some form of microphone coverage, we are so

advising the Department and pertinent logs, together in

some cases with other supporting material, are being obtained

from the field for review by Departmental attorneys.

The Department made public the fact that such a

review was under way in the filing of a memorandum with the

Supreme Court by the Solicitor General in the Joseph Schipani

case, November 30, 1966.

Set forth as follows are the brief circumstances

regarding individual prosecutive situations in which, to

date, the Department has made disclosures to various courts

regarding the FBI's use of electronic listening devices of

pertinence to those prosecutions.

Joseph Frank Schipani

Schipani is a New York hoodlum and a member of

La Cosa Nostra who was convicted and sentenced to three years

imprisonment and fined $12,500 for violation of the income tax

laws for the years 1956 through 1960.

In response to the

Department's request, they were provided with logs reporting

those instances where

Schipani was covered by an

electronic

surveillance.

This electronic surveillance was not directly

on Schipani but was in an office frequented by top La Cosa

Nostra racket figures. On November 30, 1966, the Solicitor

General requested the

Supreme Court to vacate the judgment

regarding Schipani of the Court of Appeals and remand the

to the District Court for a new trial. On December 12,

1966,

the Supreme Court complied with the request of the

Solicitor General. This was installed under the general

authority of the Attorney General, as were all of the

following unless otherwise specified.

Louis J. Taglianetti

The Department on December 27, 1966, filed a motion

to remand in the United States Court of

Appeals for the first

Circuit in the Louis j. Taglianetti appeal from the judgment

•of the United States District Court for the District of

Rhode Island. Taglianetti, a member of the Raymond Patriarca

"family" of La Cosa Nostra, was indicted on February 26, 1963,

for income tax evasion for the years 1956, 1957, and 1958.

He was found guilty on September 16, 1966. Taglianetti

appealed but no brief had yet been filed.

The Department's motion indicated Taglianetti's

conversations had been monitored by microphone surveillance

at the place of business of a close associate (Raymond Patriarca)

where Taglianetti andothers met and that this establishment

was being utilized for purposes connected with organized crime.

On various occasions

between Narch, 196z, when this microphone

was installed with trespass under general

authority of the

Attorney General, until 1965, Taglianetti's conversations

related to his income tax indictment. None of the information

was used in evidence or was the source of leads to any evidence

in the case.

The Department's motion noted that Taglianetti's

case was within the ambit of the Supreme Court's decision in

the Black case, decided November 7, 1966. The distinguishing

feature between the two is the intrusion

upon attorney-client

conversations in the Black case, for which the Supreme Court

vacated the conviction and granted a new trial. The Department's

reasons for the motion to remand in Taglianetti was for the

limited purpose of enabling the District Court to examine the

facts and to determine whether Taglianetti's conviction should

stand or a new trial be ordered.

The defense has now filed a motion for new trial

claiming that, "The Government, having tasted the torbidden

fruit of its illegal bugging and having withheld all knowledge

thereof from the defendant, his counsel

and the trial judge,

cannot now preserve the conviction thus obtained because such

forbidden fruit failed to produce a sweet taste." Hearings

on these motions have not yet been

scheduled.

FRANK DE NIRO, JR.

MICHAEL DE NIRO

LOUIS DE NIRO

The De Niro brothers were convicted 3/23/65 of

conspiring to defraud the U. S. in evading estate taxes.

They have appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the

Sixth Circuit.

The Cleveland Office conducted a microphone

surveillance from 2/19/64 to 6/16/64 in the

office of the

National Cigarette Service, Youngstown, Ohio, a vending

machine company, operated by the De Niros.

In response to the

Department's request 10/14/66 we disclosed the circumstances

of this surveillance to them by letter 10/18/66, and made

available for review the surveillance logs. No information

from this source was disseminated outside the Bureau.

The Department subsequently disclosed to the

Court of Appeals by memorandum the existance of our

microphone surveillance.

Considerable reluctance vas

displayed by the Department to including in this

memorandum our general authority for installation of

electronic surveillances. They did not clearly record the

dates concerning the manner in which the Department requested

and was advised of our coverage.

Our protests were clearly

outlined in correspondence to the Department before this

memorandum was filed.

Uttimately our authority was recorded

as a footnote.

This

microphone was installed under the

general authority of the Attorney General.

Frank Peter Balistrieri

Balistrieri, the "boss" of Milwaukee's La Cosa

Nostra "family," and

as such the leader of organized crime

in that area, was brought to trial in United States District

Court, Springfield, Illinois, during October, 1966, on

the basis of an indictment

charging evasion of Federal

income taxes.

An early issue in this action was our

microphone coverage of Balistrieri and certain of his

associates.

Microphone coverage had been established on

Balistrieri's office, in an apartment maintained by his

paramour, and in the office of hoodlum attorney Dominic Frinzi,

all in Milwaukee, for various periods between 1961 and 1965.

These installations were all made in line with general

departmental authorization as outlined in the Department's

memorandum filed with the Supreme Court in the Black case.

HH 55176 DocId:32989646 Page 845

## Page 846

The defense has made a motion to suppress, based

on this electronic coverage. After hearing testimony

regarding these installations, including testimony of

Bureau personnel, and reviewing logs of the coverage in

question, the judge instructed that the trial should be

commenced, with the defense having the right to renew its

mortion after the trial, in the event evidence presented

warrants such a proceedings.

Trial was undertaken on 10/17/66. On 11/29/66

Defense Attorney Walsh suffered a heart attack and further

trial proceedings have been deferred until March 1, 1967.

None of the information produced by this microphone was

utilized in obtaining the indictment of Balistrieri.

Ronald David Carabbia

Carabbia was convicted 6/21/65 for violation of

wagering tax laws and has appealed to the U. S. Court of

Appeals, Sixth Circuit.

The Cleveland Office conducted a

microphone surveillance at the Modern News Center and

Novelties Company, Youngstown, from 1/22/62 until 3/22/62.

Carabbia and his brothers operated a gambling game at this

location. Activities covered by this surveillance included

gambling with numerous participants. The voices of the

individuals covered were never identified. It could not be

determined if the appellant was or was not present during

the operation of this source.

In response to the Department's inquiry, we

disclosed to them by letter dated 11/1/66 the circumstances

of this surveillance and made available for review all

surveillance logs. By letter dated 1/9/67, the Department

indicated its intention to disclose this microphone

surveillance by memorandum to the U. S. Court of Appeals,

Sixth Circuit. In three letters we

have advised the Department

of the brief operation of this source and that the individuals

covered were never identified. The Department's proposed

memorandum to the court notes,

question whether any conversations in which appellant

participated were even monitored."

Department apparently feels it must disclose this surveillance.

and unrestrained manner.

Jack T. Rainwater

Jack T. Rainwater has conducted a large-scale

numbers operation in the Miami, florida area.

He and siX

associates were convicted of state gambling violations in

Florida courts based upon evidence furnished by the

Internal Revenue Service and testimony of Internal Revenue

Service agents.

In response to the Department's request they.

were provided with logs reporting those instances where

Rainwater and one of his associates who also was convicted

in state court, were monitored by an electronic surveillance.

Neither of these individuals were the direct subject of an

electronic surveillance.

on January 11, 1967, the Solicitor General

disclosed to the supreme Court that an electronic device

had been utilized by Federal agents in the Rainwater matter.

Our installation in this matter was made under

general authority of the Attorney General. Information from

this source was disseminated to Internal Revenue Service who

in turn disseminated to local authorities.

Charles Joseph Battaglia, JI.

Battaglia is a lucson, Arizona, La Cosa Nostra

member who was closely affiliated

with Joseph Bonanno a

former La Cosa Nostra "Commission" member. A microphone

for criminal intelligence purposes had been maintained on

him under general Departmental authority.

He was arrested by

Bureau Agents for violation of the Hobbs

Act in March, 1965,

• as a result of making threats in an effort,to force a

tucson

firm to utilize his vending machirs. Following the granting

of several continuances the trial judge in Federal District

Court ordered Battaglia to appear for trial on the morning

of January 11, 1967,

to inform the

judge

that Battaglia had been covered by microphone

surveillances, but that the coverage had no bearing on the

evidence to be produced in substantiation of the criminal

charges against Battaglia. The Department further advised

-7=

## Page 848

. "

they were going to recommend that the judge proceed with

the trial and at the conclusion thereof, if the judge feels

it necessary, a hearing will be held to determine the validity

of the Department's claim regarding the microphone evidence.

A hearing on this motion is scheduled for Monday,

January 16, 1967, in TUCsOn, Arizona.

Edward L. Levinson, et. al., Civil Suit

On December 10, 1965, Edward Levinson, at that time

one of the owners of the

Fremont Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada,

ILLed a $6, 000,000 damage suit (later reduced to $4,200,000)

against four Bureau Agents, charging invasion of privacy and

asking injunctive relief

against further invasion by use of

electronic listening devices. Levinson filed a similar suit

against the Central Telephone Company of Las Vegas and certain

of its employees.

The case

has recently been taken over personally by

Assistant Attorney General Barefoot Sanders who is presently

reviewing all of the material in connection with preparing

a response to plaintiff's motions. No date has been set for

trial in matter. The Bureau has been pressing the Department

to take depositions in this case from such major hoodlums as

Meyer Lansky and Gerardo Catena who have hidden interests in

the Fremont Hotel.

Fred B. Black, Jr.

Fred B. Black, JI., named as being hired by front

men in Las Vegas to represent their interests in Washington,

. D. Co, where Black was alleged to have influence, was convicted

on May 5, 1965, of evading income taxes. for the period of

1956 through 1959. After a number of appeals he petitioned the

Supreme Court for

issuance of a writ of certiorari which was

denied on May 4, 1966.

On May 24, 1966, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall

filed a memorandum with the Supreme Court reporting a listening

device

had"been placed in Black's hotel suite in 1963, but

IN 55176 DocId:32989646 Page 848

- 8-

---

## Page 849

none of the evidence used in Black's trial was obtained as

a result of the listening device.

The Supreme Court on

June 13, 1966, ordered a response by the Department to

questions raised by the Court with regard to the initial

memorandum filed by the Department which was answered on

July 13, 1966, by supplemental memorandum.

This memorandum indicated the listening device,

installed with trespass under general Departmental authori~

zation had monitored conversations of Black and his attorney.

The United States Supreme Court on November 7, .

1966,

vacated the income tax conviction and granted a new

trial, which will

not be set until after the Robert Baker trial.

. •

To date, the Bureau

has received over 1,000 names

of individuals of prosecutive interest for a determination

if such subjects have been covered by FBI microphones.

number of problems have resulted.

One problem which has been encountered, and

which can be expected to be even more serious in the future,

is the lack of identifying data accompanying the names of

individuals on whom the Department has made inquiry in these

matters. For example, one list recently received included

475 names, in some cases with a minimum of identifying data

and in others with no identifying data at all. In order that

an accurate determination can

be made whether

an individual

in question has, in fact, been covered by one of our microphones,

it will be necessary that the Department provide adequate

identifying data when submitting these names for review.

- 9 -

1H7 77176 DocIt: 72989616 Page 819

---

## Page 850

An attendant problem has arisen in certain

inquiries in which the Department has made unreasonable

requests for such reviews on extremely

short notice.

One of

these involved a request for the results of the review later

the same day it was

received. Thoroughness and accuracy, of

absolute necessity in this type review, make extremely rapid

checks such as this in most cases impossible, and at best,

a very dangerous procedure.

With regard to those situations in which the

Department has made disclosures to the various courts,

continuing reluctance has been evidenced on their part to

inform the court of the fact that the installation in question

has been utilized by the FBI under either specific authority

from the Attorney General, or under the general Departmental

authority which was granted.

The Department has been repeatedly

reminded of their reluctance in these individual situations.

The volume involved in this project has caused

a decided strain on the Bureau in processing these numerous

inquiries to date, and these problems become magnified when

the enormity of the entire project is assessed, in view of

indications by the Department that the full review

may

encompass as many as 30,000 names.

FUGITIVE SECTION

Cassius Marcellus Clay

Cassius Clay, world's heavyweight boxing

champion and Black Muslim, earlier this year filed a

claim as a conscientious objector and more recently has

applied to his draft board at Louisville, Kentucky, for

a ministerial deferment as a minister of the Black Muslim

religion.

After a very extensive investigation by the

Bureau, Clay's draft board denied his claim as a

conscientious objector and placed him in a l-A classification.

Since the board's

vote was unanimous, he has no further

appeal as a conscientious objector.

His ministerial

deferment request will now have to be considered by his

local board which our sources indicate will meet in the

next few days.

. If the local board denies this request,

Clay has the right to appeal.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be used

in preventing communists from gaining control in that country.

We set up a staff of ten Agents.

In August, 1966, at White

House instructions we established a permanent Legal Attache

The six-mönth-old government under Joaquin Balaguer

has brought about a degree of stability.

Nevertheless, there

continue to be strong undercurrents of

dissension. The

rightists reportedly have considered plots to remove Balaguer.

Juan Bosch's political party, loser in the June, 1966, election,

has been most vocal in its opposition to Balaguer's programs.

The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension

but to accomplish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have in the past. In fact, a student strike in Santo

Domingo, which began January 9, 1967, has attracted strong

communist support and has served as a rallying point for the

extreme leftists. Within two days,

seventy percent of the

students in secondary schools had

joined the strike.

This is but one of numerous problems which beset

Balaguer, although to date he has been able to meet each one

head on.

King has been counseled by Stanley Levison, his principal advisor

and long-time communist, to run for President of the United States

At present,

Carmichael is facing charges of "inciting to riot" in Atlanta,

He was convicted of these charges

in Selma, Alabama; however, the conviction is currently under

ROBERT G. BAKER

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

The most recent development relative to the trial

of Baker is the disclosure in the afternoon edition of "The

Evening Star," 1/12/67, that the Narcotics Bureau of the

Treasury Department installed a "bug" in the Baker case.

It

is reported that this installation relates to the Department's

admission during the trial that it had planted a microphone

and transmitter on Wayne Bromley, a prime Government witness,

in order to record the results of a meeting held on 3/26/65,

at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, Los Angeles, California, which

was attended by Baker, Clifford Jones and Bromley.

The

article points out that the FBI had refused a request of the

Department to cover this meeting.

It also points out that

according to Edward Bennett Williams,. Baker's attorney, that

in compliance with an order of Judge Gasch to turn over tapes

and transcripts, only notes made by two monitors were received

indicating the tape was not usable or available.

This meeting at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel is the

meeting which was arranged during telephone calls on 3/25/65,

between Bromley and Baker and Bromley and Jones which were

monitored and tape recorded by the Bureau at the request of

the Department, with the Department's assurance that such action

was legal and with the written consent of Bromley. A complete

transcript of these recordings was made available to the

Department.

Although the Department did on 3/25/65,

request that

we monitor the meeting in Los Angeles, we refused to do so.

Upon revelation during pretrial hearings that this meeting

was monitored, Acting Attorney Generad Ramsey Clark was questioned

as to who performed this

monitoring. He stated that he had ascer-

tained that upon the FBI's refusal to comply with the departmental

request, the Department had then turned to either the Immigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) or the Bureau of Narcotics.

He was certain that it was the Bureau of Narcotics.

The only other coverage of any conversations by Baker

was accidental in nature and resulted from installations which

had been placed on Fred B. Black in Washington, D. C.; the

F remont Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada; Edward Siegelbaum, Miami,

- 19 -

HH 55176 DocId:32989646 Page 874

## Page 875

Florida, (ald in connection with organized

crime matters) and

the Dominican Embassy (in connection with security matters).

Details concerning these installations were set forth in a

summary

memorandum regarding the Bureau's involvement in the

prosecution of Baker. dated 1/10/67.

Logs relative to the electronic surveillances on

Black, the E remont Hotel and Siegelbaum were furnished to

the Department and excerpts were furnished to the trial judge

who ordered that they be made available to the defense.

These

logs were the subject of pretrial hearings during November, 1966,

following which the judge ruled that there was no causal

relationship between

the information in the logs and the

charges in the indictment.

Logs concerning Baker's conversations intercepted

on the Dominican Embassy installation were similarly furnished

to the Department and to the trial judge who placed a

protective order thereon and has instructed that any dis-

cussions relative to them must be held only in his chambers.

Information as to the existence of these logs has been

leaked to the press, presumably by Edward Bennett Williams

to cause some action favorable to his. client. His reporting

to the trial judge that the FBI was responsible for this leak

is absolutely ridiculous and is completely unfounded.

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

James Riddle Hoffa and three others were convicted

In chattanooga federal Court, 3/4/64, 01 Obstruction 0j

rustice related to their eriorts to tamper with certali

members of the jury in a previous trial of Hoffa.

These

convictions were upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court on 12/12/66.

In response to a request from Assistant Attorney

General Fred M. Vinson, Jr., we furnished a letter to th€

Acting Attorney General on 12/29/66, of instances in which

the conversations of Hoffa and two other defendants were

overheard through the use of electronic devices. Hoffa, his

office, and his home were not the direct targets of any

electronic devices in

the development of this case, and the

Acting Attorney General was so advised in our memorandum of.

12/29/66.

The instances in which he appeared to have been

present at conversations monitored occurred in Detroit,

Michigan, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 1961 and

1962 our Detroit office overheard

three conversations of Hoffa.

These conversations were

broadcast to and

from radio-telephones in automobiles

operated by Teamsters

Union personnel in the Detroit area.

This was

accomplished through the use of a tunable

commercial-type IN radio receiver which was in operation in

our Detroit

office. No trespass was involved in this

connection.

In addition, between 2/1 and 8/12/63, Hoffa

appears to have participated in four telephone

conversations

with two Las Vegas hoodlum figures who were being covered by

electronic eavesdropping devices (trespass involvea).

Hoffa's part of these conversations was not overheard.

Zeno Thomas Osborn, Jr., (Nashville lawyer and

former attorney for Hoffa) was convicted 5/29/64, in

Nashville Federal Court of obstruction of justice arising

from his attempts to influence a potential juror in a forth-

coming trial of Hoffa. In this investigation, a miniature

recorder was concealed on a cooperative Government witness

during a meeting with Osborn.

This installation was made

at the request of the Department and with the prior approval

of the two Federal judges in Nashville.

No trespass was

involved, and the use of this installation was brought out

fully during Osborn's trial. His conviction was affirmed by

the Supreme Court 12/12/66.

The Department is fully aware of

this installation and details of same were included in our

letter to the Acting Attorney General 12/29/66.

At the specific request of former Attorney General

Kennedy, a microphone surveillance (trespass required) was

conducted on the Washington, D. C., hotel room of James E.

Haggerty (former attorney for James Riddle Hoffa) during

period 8/7/61, through 8/11/61.

specific purpose of identifying an alleged "contact" of

Hoffa's in the Justice Department, whom Kennedy thought

Haggerty would meet in Washington.

this coverage was included in our letter to the Acting

Attorney General dated 12/29/66.

In addition, in response

to a letter from Vinson dated 12/29/66, we furnished the

Acting Attorney General copies of logs. prepared in connection

with this coverage by memorandum dated 1/6/67.

JURY PANEL INVESTIGATIONS

Government into the rights of defendants in criminal

trials and in order to assure that future requests for

CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS IN MISSISSIPPI

Two major civil rights cases are awaiting

prosecutive action in Mississippi. One of these cases

involves the murder of three civil rights workers near

Philadelphia, Mississippi, in dune, 1904, in which case

eighteen subjects were previously indicted on civid rights

charges by a Federal Grand Jury.

The other case involves

the shooting and burning of the residence of Vernon Ferdinand

Dahmer, past president of the NAAC?, near Hattiesburg,

Mississippi, in January, 1966, resulting in the death of

Dahmer•

A Federal Grand Jury

indicted fifteen members of

the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi

relative to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights

Statute.

In view of a court decision subsequent to the

above indictments, it was determined by the Government that

all of the indictments in these two cases are faulty because

certain minority groups including Negroes had been excluded

from the grand

jury.

The Department has been pushing for

early representations to a properly composed grand jury and

had contemplated that both of these cases would be given to

a Federal Grand Jury being empaneled 1/16/57.

On 1/3/67 U. S. District Judge Harold Cox advised

SAC Roy Moore that he had instructed the U.S. Attorney to

use the January grand jury for the purpose of

checking into

possible misuse of funds in the Headstart project sponsored

by the Office of Economic Opportunity in Mississippi. The

Judge referred to press accounts stating that the Government

was providing additional money for this project although

it has been alleged that several hundred thousand dollars

of the initial appropriation was unaccounted for. Judge Cox

said that he felt

"first things come first" and thereiore

decided to use the grand jury to ferret out any possible

fraud in connection with the failure to account for these

funds. He stated he would advise SAC Moore when he convenes

another grand jury to hear the civil rights cases. Judge Cox

added that this will be done sometime in the near future

but that no specific date has been set.

It has been

speculated in the press that it Judge

Cox fails to promptly

call a

grand jury to hear the civil rights cases the

Government will seek mandamus from the U.S. Circuit Court

of Appeals for the purpose of forcing Judge Cox to call a

grand jury to hear these cases.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING CRIMES

AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS

By letter to the Attorney General 3/1/65, we called

attention to the rise in crimes against banking institutions and

recommended the Department propose legislation which would require

bank supervisory agencies to establish minimum security requirements

for all banks under Federal Charter. A follow-up letter was sent on

3/29/65, and again on 3/1/66. The Department advised on 4/12/66,

that a legislative proposal was being developed. A proposed bill was

submitted for our review on 6/6/66, which we returned on 6/9/66,

recommending no changes. In reply to our inquiry on 7/25/66, the

Department, on 8/3/66, advised the Bill was under study by the

Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

We inquired again on 10/6/66, and on 10/26/66, were

advised that since the 89th Congress was so near an end, the legis-

lation would be included on program for 90th Congress.

By letter

11/28/66, we were advised that the Bill had been returned to the

Criminal Division with certain observations and suggestions. On

1/9/67, we again called attention to the increase in violations. Current

figures show that during calendar year 1966, violations increased to

1871, a new all-time high, surpassing the 1749 violations in calendar

year 1965.

• WALTER BERYL CHIPMAN, ET AL.

CRIME ON HIGH SEAS

Alvin Junior Cupp, who had received a five-year

Federal term on 3/16/65, in Marquette, Michigan, furnished

information to Chicago Agents pinpointing officials and "goons"

of the Seamens International Union (SIU) responsible for the

1963 bombing of the Canadian freighter, - "Howard L. Shaw"

in Chicago, Illinois.

Upon Cupp's parole from prison 12/23/66, he was

immediately contacted by union officials allegedly for the purpose

of paying him off a promised $8, 000 for maintaining his silence

relative to the "Howard L. Shaw" bombing while in prison.

The U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago requested that an

electronic device be attached to Cupp's person to record con-

versations with union officials, anticipating evidence would be

obtained whereby prosecution of these officials would be

forthcoming. SAC, Chicago advised the U. S. Attorney on

1/4/67, that the Bureau could not accede to his request since the

Solicitor General had publicly announced that all eavesdropping

is illegal.

At approximately 9 P.M., 1/5/67, the Acting Attorney

General called Mr. DeLoach relative to this case, indicating he

felt this was a legal device and he could see no reason why it

should not be used. Mr. DeLoach informed the Acting Attorney

General if he felt this way he should put these views in writing,

since the FBI could not afford to be criticized on one hand and then

on the other hand be directed by the Department-to enter into such

procedures. The Acting Attorney General, upon a moment's

reflection, stated that in view of the "psychological situation" he

probably would not put this request in writing and perhaps would

inform the Organized Crime Section of the Department not to

request the FBI to utilize this device. We have since received no

such request from the Acting Attorney General.

Source stated that the Soviet occupation has

split the peace movement, and WSP in particular, that it

might be better to postpone the invitation temporarily.

UTEKHINA told source that all expenses would

be paid while in the Soviet Union. However, the delegates

probably would have to arrange to pay their round trip air

fare from the United States to Moscow, USSR, and return.

The group would leave from New York City or Montreal,

Canada. UTEKHINA stated it may be possible to fly the

group via Soviet commercial craft in which case the cost

of transportation might be borne by the Soviets.

Source discussed UTEKHINA's proposed with WSP

leaders and it was agreed in bring this matter up at a

Regional Conference of WSP which

is being held in early

October, 1968, with the idea of sending the delegation

to the Soviet Union late in October or early November.

Source advised UTEKHINA that SARAH

SHORESMAN on the West Coast, who is in charge of the WSP

International Clearing House, would be in charge of making

arrangements for the trip. She inquired of UTEKHINA what

the air fare would be. UTEKHINA later telephoned to advise

that a round trip ticket from New York to Moscow, Economy

Tourist Class, is $730. UTEKHINA stated that if the source

1s interested, as an individual in going to the Soviet Union,

• she should contact RICHARD MORFORD at the Soviet-American

Friendship Society, 156 5th Avenue, New York City, because

there is a 21 day tour arranged by

the National Council

of American-Soviet Friendship costing all together $795.

The latter has been verified by(ur 279-S*) on

9/20/68.

Source has indicated to UTTKHINA that if she

goes to the Soviet Union she would like to go on to Hanoi,

DRV, before returning in the United States.

an invitation from the Committee to send a delegation to the

ments made and details from Moscow by early next week

(October 13-19, 1968). As it stands now, the degation will

leave New York City as soon after the Presidential election

insanesuse

as possible. The delegation will travel via Aeroflot or

Pan American World Airways and in either case the round trip

fare will be $548.00, which is the reduced off season rate.

Bureau authority is requested to advance to infor

mant the cost of her round trip air fare fron New York to

Moscow and return, in the amount of $548.00.

It is recommended that this authority be granted

inasmuch as it is believed that

source will learn about

activities in the peace groups in the Soviet Inion which are

directed toward influencing similar peace groups in the

United States.

Source undoubtedly will encounter informa-

tion on her trip concerning foreign influence on the New

This is to recommend the advancement of $800

over and above the existing expense authorization to

(WF 1777-S)which will enable us to have the benefit of

informant's attendance at the above co

Congress.

He sent this informant to Moscow, USSR, in

November, 1968, to attend a meeting between Women Strike

for Peace (WSP) and the Soviet Women's Committee (SWC).

At that time the SWC representatives stated the above

Congress was to be held and that the Vietnam situation

would be the main focus of attention. In the event

hostilities were still going on the SWC said that the

Congress would address itself to "all phases of work to

end the war."

In addition, the informant's visit was

very fruitful and we continue to realize berefits from it

through material she receives from contacts made at the

conference.

Informant has been cleared by the steering

committee of the WSP to attend the above Congress and

can do so without raising any question as to the source

of funds. Informant has advised that this Congress is

to include delegates from all over the world including

North and South Vietnam.

She anticipates traveling with

the leadership of the WSP and

that she can renew contacts

previously made with the National Liberation Front, the

North Vietnamese and various Russian women.

RE:

WORLD CONGRESS OF WOMEN

HELSINKI, FINLAND

JUNE 14 - 17, 1969

This is another so-called peace conference similar

to the one held in Sweden May 16 - 19, 1969.

We sent one of our

New York informants to this conference

and received extremely

valuable intelligence information regarding the current

situation in South Vietnam as a result: It is probable that

W-s will be in a position through her contacts to furnisi

equally valuable information.

Ve currently pay WF 1777-S.

up to $200 per month for services and up to $75 per month for

expenses.

The attendance of the informant at this conference

can provide invaluable advanced intelligence data concerning

the forthcoming Soviet-directed world-wide peace offensive

against the United States. It will also afford us a live

informant in a behind-the-scenes situation involving

individuals from all over the world intent upon destroying

the United States position as it pertains to Vietnam. It

will also enable the informant to solidify previous contacts

and to develop new ones among foreign leftist elements. We

should avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity to produce

positive intelligence information.

ACTION:

With your approval, the attached airtel

authorizing

the advancement of $800 to (WE 1777-S)will be directed to the

Washington Field Office.

BACKGROUND:

The SCV was organized in 1967 and is controlled to

some extent by the Soviet-dominated World Council for Peace

(WCP). The SCV, since its inception, has been one of the

major sounding boards for anti-American propaganda in connection

with the war in Vietnam. This group has also provided the

North Vietnamese with a

The forthcoming conference in Stockholm will

undoubtedly hammer out the details tor additional moves and

the peace movement on a

national and international scale

having contacts with major women's groups throughout the

United States and in the Soviet Union.

This informant, in

I June, 1969, attended a meeting of the WCP in East Berlin on

'our behalf

and furnished excellent intelligence information.

She has received an official SCV invitation and is in a logical

position to attend. This informant is a retired schoolteacher

and can make this trip without creating any suspicion.

Washington Field Office has advised that informant

tentatively plans to depart on 11/26/70 in order to reach

Informant would depart Stockholm on 12/1/70 consistent with

Anticipated expenses are: round trip

OBSERVATION:

the extent to which foreign groups, such as the

SCV and the WCP, have gone in the recent past to discredit

the United States and their continuing propaganda barrage

aimed at this country make it most desirable that we have

firsthand information regarding future plans of this group.

We will also be in a position to identify other United States

citizens in attendance.

For these reasons it is felt we

should avail ourselves of the opportunity to utilize the

informant's services as noted above.

An airtel to Washington

Field Office authorizing this informant to travel to Sweden

is attached.

Washington Field Office is being instructed

to immediately debrief the informant upon her return and to

obtain an exact accounting of expenses incurred.

CONSIDERTIA!

Source stated that the Soviet occupation has

split the peace movement, and WSP in particular, that it

might be better to postpone the invitation temporarily.

UTEKHINA told source that all expenses would

be paid while in the Soviet Union. However, the delegates

probably would have to arrange to pay their Inund trip air

fare from the United States to Moscow, USSi, and return.

The group would leave from New York City or Montreal,

Canada.

UTEKHINA stated it may be possible to fly the

group via Soviet commercial craft in which case the cost

of transportaion might be borne by the Soviets.

Source discassed UTEKHINA's proposed with WSP

leaders and it was agreed in bring this matter up at a

Regional Conference of WSP which is being held in early

October, 1968, with the idea of sending the delegation

to the Soviet Union late in October or early November.

Spurce advised UTEKHINA that SARAH

SHORESMAN on the West Coast, who is in charge of the WSP

International Clearing House, wuld be in charge of making

arrangements for the trip.

She inquired of UTEKHINA what

the air fare would be. UTEKHINA later telephoned to advise

that a round trip ticket from New York En Moscow, Economy

Tourist Class, is $730. UTEKHINA stated that if

the source

is interested, as an individual in going to the Soviet Union,

she should contact RICHARD MORFORD at the Soviet-American

Friendship Society, 156 5th Avenue, New York City, because

there is a 21 day tour arranged by

the Natinnal Council

of American-Soviet Friendship costing all together $795.

ELECTROIUIC

The latter has been verified by SuRVELLANLE on

9/20/68.

•Source has indicated to UTEKHINA that if she

goes to the Soviet Union she would llke to go on to Hanni,

DRV, before returning to the United States.

This is another so-called peace conference similar

to the one held in Sweden May 16 - 19, 1969.

We sent one of our

New York informants to this conference and received extremely

valuable intelligence information regarding the current

equally valuable information.

We currently pay INFOrMAN

up to s400 per month for services and up to $75 per month lor

expenses.

The attendance of the informant at this conference

can provide invaluable advanced intelligence data concerning

the forthcoming Soviet-directed world-wide peace offensive

against the United States. It will also afford us a live

informant in a behind-the-scenes situation involving

individuals from all over the world intent upon destroying

the United States position as it pertains to Vietnam.

will also enable the informant to solidify previous contacts

and to develop new ones among foreign leftist elements.

PURPOSE:

Office be authorized to advance the sum of $775 to INFORMANT

to enable this informant to attend a conference of the above

group in Stockholm, Sweden, on 11/28-30/70.

BACKGROUND:

The SCV was organized in 1967 and is controlled to

some extent by the Sowiet-dominated World_Counctl. for Peace.

(WCP) • The sCV, since its inception, has been one of the

major sounding boards for anti-American propaganda in connection

with the war in Vietnam. This group has also provided the

North Vietnamese with a

propaganda outlet and has enhanced

the position of the North Vietnamese delegation to the Paris

Peace Talks:

The forthcoming conference in Stockholm will

undoubtedly hammer out the details for additional moves and

propaganda against the United States' position in Vietnam.

It is therefore, most desirable we afford hete mished in

live informant coverage. INFORMANT

the peace movement on a national and international scale

having contacts with major women's groups throughout the

United States and in the Soviet Union.

This informant, in

I June, 1969, attended a meeting of the

WCP in East Berlin on

'our behalI

and furnished excellent intelligence information.

She has received an official SCV invitation and is in a logical

position to attend.

This informant is a retired schoolteacher

and can make this trip without creating any suspicion.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re:

Stockholm Conference on Vietnam

100-453546

Washington Field Office has advised that informant

tentatively plans to depart on 11/26/70 in order to reach

Stockholm on 11/27/70 in order to attend a preparatory meeting.

Informant would depart Stockholm on 12/1/70 consistent with

airline schedules.

Anticipated expenses are:

round trip

air fare at $596.60; registration fee, $20; incidental expenses

including room and board at $158.40.

OBSERVATION:

The extent to which foreign groups, such as the

SCV and the WCP, have gone in the recent past to discredit

propaganda barrage

aimed at this country make it most desirable that we have

firsthand information regarding future plane of this groun:

We will also be in a position to identify other United States

citizens in attendance. For these reasons it is felt we

should avail ourselves of the opportunity to utilize the

informant's services as noted above. An airtel to Washington

Field Office authorizing this informant to travel to Sweden

is attached. Washington Field Office is being instructed

to immediately debrief the informant upon her return and to

obtain an exact accounting of expenses incurred.

ACTION:

With your approval, the attached airtel will be

forwarded to Washington Field Office.

SUBJECT:

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF CONFERENCE

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8, 1970, 5:00 P.M.

In accordance with the Director's instructions, I attended the

captioned briefing which was commenced at 5:03 p.m. by the Attorney General who

introduced the Director and the Director thereafter briefed all attendees on the

work of the FBI. As the attendees arrived for the meeting I made available to each

individual the bound FBI exhibit to which they could refer in following the Director's

presentation. There were 29 departmental representatives present at this staff

meeting. They were very attentive to the Director's presentation as indicated by

the many questions following the Director's discussion. When the Director was

providing the conference with the number of Negroes employea by the FBI, including

Agent and clerical breakdown, Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst interrupted the

Director and asked the Director to repeat these figures in order that he might

frecord them.

At approximately 5:25 p.m. the Attorney General left the room to

receive a telephone call. The Director questioned Deputy Attorney General

Kleindienst as to whether he should continue or wait for the Attorney General's

return. Mr. Kleindienst suggested the Director wait until the Attorney General

returned.

Mr. Kleindienst asked the Director concerning his references to the

volume of civil rights work - whether this included both civil and criminal investiga-

tions handled by the FBI under the Civil Rights Statutes and the Director replied

in the affirmative.

Mr. Kleindienst then referred to the number of organized crime type

cases the Director said are pending prosecutive action. He said are these all

organized crime individuals.

The Director replied they all have some connection

with the many facets of organized crime. The Director went on to say many of

these cases are"pending a year or two and he felt if we had swift prosecution and

substantial punishment a greater inroad could be made in removing the menace of

organized crime. Mr. Kleindienst then commented that he felt that some of the

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

problem here might be due to the resourcefulness of the organized crime subject's

attorneys. The Director replied that certainly this is true where such shysters

as Edward Bennett Williams represent these characters and he uses every technical

trick to avoid prosecution and conviction. The Director went on to say that Attorney

Kuntsler does the same thing in his field.

At this point, Wilson's Deputy, Petersen, of the Criminal Division,

took this opportunity to point out to Kleindienst that what is needed here are more

Assistant United States Attorneys, whereupon the Solicitor, General added that

•Federal judges were also needed.

Kleindienst then asked Petersen if he had studied

these cases and the reason for delay that Mr. Hoover referred to and Petersen

stated he did not have these figures at the end of his tongue but he had a survey

made and, as he recalled it, there were 185 of these type cases delinquent six months

lor more. The others were delayed because of some court motion or action. The

Solicitor General asked whether there was any concentration of these cases and

Petersen said the Southern District of New York. Kleindienst then asked Petersen

how many Assistant United States Attorneys he needed to do the job and Petersen

said he could not give him a figure; however, he said he felt the District of

Columbia's, for example, staff could be increased by half again as many at least

and other appropriate increases would be necessary in major metropolitan

centers.

Mr. Hoover at this point, pointed out Senate Bill 30 is going to put

the FBI, if passed, into the local gambling picture and that we, in order to fulfill

our responsibility, will probably have to ask for an additional 600 Agents. He

pointed out that he hoped that the Criminal Division would draw up appropriate

guidelines to prevent local authorities from relinquishing their responsibilities

to also investigate local gambling:

At approximately 5:35 p.m., Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst

advised the conference that the Attorney General was called to the White House

and requested the Director/proceed with the briefing. At approximately 5:55 p.m.,

the Director completed his briefing and was congratulated by the Deputy Attorney

General for the excellent presentation and the Deputy then opened the floor for

questions.

Memorandum j. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Assistant Attorney General Leo M. Pellerzi, Administrative Division,

referred to the FBI exhibits and in particular Exhibit No. 25 and questioned

Mr. Hoover as to why the State of Virginia had such a high number of Laboratory

examinations. Mr. Hoover explained that Virginia had no Laboratory and that

that was the reason for the high usage of the FBI Laboratory. Mr. Hoover took

this opportunity to explain the FBI's policy in not making our experts available

when local experts have already examined the evidence or are going to testify as to

the evidence. He also explained there are many "phonies" who are traveling about

the country conducting examinations and testifying but we, in these cases, have

briefed the prosecuting attorneys in advance. The Director explained that in such

places as New York State where they have their own Laboratories they only use

our Lab for the more sophisticated examinations.

Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst then questioned the Director as

to the basic qualifications for the position of Special Agent. The Director explained.

that they all had to be either lawyers or accountants or college graduates majoring

in science or language. The Director emphasized again that we have no discrimina-

tion and that we have many fine Negro Agents in the FBI, pointing out that only last

week he gave a meritorious award to a Negro Agent from our Detroit Office who had

developed valuable informants in the Black Panthers and related organizations in

that area. Kleindienst then asked the Director approximately how many applicants

we turn down for each Agent that we accept. The Director explained that for every

100 applicants 90 of them are turned down:

He said that we carefully interview

these men, investigate them, test them, and give them thorough physical examina-

tions to make sure they meet our high standards. The Director told the conference

that he has a standing rule that if any Agent in Charge recommends an Agent or

clerk who is a hippie type; that is, long hair, sideburns, etc., this Agent in Charge

is going to lose his office, and we are going to get rid of the applicant. He said he

would not tolerate any hippie types in the FBI and do not want our Agents going into

Federal court looking like hippies.

The Director pointed out that many of our young clerical employees

are going on to school to become Agents, and he demands the same discipline of

these young people. He also pointed out that some 6,000 people a day tour our

facilities and we don't want them getting the idea the FBI has any hippie types.

As a matter of fact, the Director said with a smile that he would like to declare

open season on these hippies just like you have open season on the deer and shoot

them.

Memorandum j. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Mr. Kleindienst was also interested in the scope of our work and in

this regard the Director took this opportunity to point out that he did not believe the

FBI should be investigating every bomb threat and that he hoped that if the new bomb

legislation as proposed by the President is passed the Department's Criminal

Division will set appropriate guidelines. The Director pointed out that many of

these major cities have very excellent bomb squads and they are fully equipped to

handle these complaints. He said why should the FBI be paralleling work done by

competent local authorities. He said, of course, in the local areas where they have

no people qualified, then this is a different matter. The Director said in all of these

cases we are always willing to make our FBI Laboratory facilities and Identification

facilities available as well as assist the local authorities by covering out-of-state

leads.

Assistant Attorney General Johnnie M. Walters asked the Director

if he could see any lessening of the problems that he talked about in the foreseeable

future. The Director said in the organized crime field, if the steps he has

recommended are taken, he feels there will be a decrease. With regard to the

disorders in colleges and in the high schools and caused by the militants he said

this is another story. The Director cited the incident of one of the subjects in the

Chicago Seven trial appearance last night at American University and thereafter

going to Catholic University and then leaving town. He said that apparently these

university administrators will not call in the local police, and he said it was dis-

graceful how they threw rocks, destroyed property and set fires at American

University. He then also cited the incident wherein attorney Kuntsler after he went

out to Santa Barbara, California, gave a speech, and then left town, that Santa

Barbara was the victim of three days of looting and burning. The Director cited

the violence promised in New Haven when Bobby Seale is brought to trial whereupon

the Solicitor General commented that the judge who is going to try that case was his

law school roommate. The Director said that this is a very serious situation and

it is entirely possible that violence will occur when Seale is tried. The Director

pointed out that we have appropriately advised all localauthorities of this possibility.

The Director then cited the tremendous problems that Judge Hoffman

in Chicago had ir handling the trial and said that one could hardly blame him for some

of his actions in view of the provocative acts on the part of the subjects and the

attorneys. The Director said he recalled that Judge Medina in New York, when he

tried the Communist Party leaders, the experience was so trying that it actually

broke his health. Peterson at this point injected a comment that his people are

trying to find out whether in the New Haven Bobby Seale case the Panthers are

going: to try to kidnap the Department's representative whose name is Lynch or

whether they are referring to the Attorney General of the State of California whose

name is also Lynch and the Director said he felt it was the Department of Justice

representative being referred to.

The Director took this opportunity speaking about retaliatory action

to point out that he was very concerned over the kidnapping of diplomatic officials

in South America and said he felt it would be repeated in this country. He hoped

the guard force for the embassies and chanceries in the Nation's Capital would be

promptly secured as the President is also very concerned about this.

In further reply to Mr. Walters question, the Director also pointed

out that he felt many of these college presidents needed to be more firm and take

drastic action by expelling these students from the school, not giving them amnesty,

and assisting the local prosecutors in prosecuting these people.

The Solicitor

General indicated that he also felt many of the faculty were also/contributing

factor to this problem. The Director agreed. The Director pointed out that these

student problems in the college or high school can be traced back to the parental

responsibility. The Director said that District of Columbia policemen have told

him that many young children are out on the street at all hours of the night and

their parents don't even know, and in some instances, care where they are. The

Director told them of the incident of where four of our Identification people were

held up and a female employee raped and how the juvenile giant when arrested had

a juvenile court record of four appearances without a single sentence and how the

Director had requested the court to try him as an adult but they refused to do so.

The Director referred to the fact that we have too many bleeding heart judges

and told of the success Judge Loble has had in Montana in handling juvenile subjects.

Memo J. J. Casper to Mr. M

hr 4/8/70

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference - 4/8/70 - 5 PM

George J. Reed, Chairman, Board of Parole, questioned Mr. Hoover

as to the extent. of Communist influence in all of this New Left, Black Panther,

Students for a Democratic Society, and militant action that we are faced with.

The Director explained that the Communist Party will join anything that will

further its causes and that they get their orders directly from Moscow. He

said their influence in some organizations is complete control and in others

it is only one of participation but, he pointed out, they are always the most

vocal and, consequently, are very intluential in those groups that they participate

in. He said the Black Panthers follow the philosophies of many international

revolutionary Communists.

The Director then cited the insident of the young

girl who blew up her father's home in New York which she had turned into a

bomb factory. He stated she started to get out of control when at Bryn Mawr

she joined the Students for a Democratic Society, and now she has fled to

Canada and we are unable to extradite her.

At this point Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst thanked Mr. Hoover

for his outstanding presentation. He said he felt they all had a better knowledge

of the FBI and a greater appreciation of the many problems from a security and

crime standpoint facing our country. With that, the official part of the conference

was adjourned. Many of the conferees came up and personally congratulated Mr.

Hoover and thanked him for his presentation, including asking Mr. Hoover to

autograph the FBI exhibit folder which had been passed out to each participant.

I feel this outstanding presentation on the part of the Director brought

great credit and praise for our organization. Hopefully, it will act as an incentive

to some of our counterparts in the Department to do a more aggressive job

in fulfilling their dusies in meeting their security and criminal responsibilities.

Submitted for intormation.

BRIEF FOR DIRECTOR'S USE IN

O CONNECTION WITH ATTORNEY

GENERAL'S STAFF CONFERENCE

WEDNESDAYS, 5:00 P.M.

Reference is made to my memorandum of 3/13/70,

a brief for the Director's use in connection with captioned conference. You

were advised this material would be edited each week to insure that it was in

a current status!

There are attached amended pages 11, 12, 16, and 26 which

15 hould be danses ted in the briel.

The change on page 11 is under the subheading "Stock and

Bond Thefts," and the last sentence has been changed to reflect that the

amount recovered is now $8, 026, 000 and that 29 individuals have been C

charged. The change on page 12 is the fact that the last sentence on the page

has been added to show that the United States Attorney in Baltimore, with

the approval of the Attorney General, plans to seek the indictment of

Congressman Dowdy and two others on 3/31/70. The change on page 16 is

in the first paragraph, reflecting that the Identification Division made an

identification in connection with the Wilkerson bombing in New York. It

also points out that Cathlyn Wilkerson and Kathy Boudin are among six other

fugitives being sought by the FBI after they failed to appear to answer local

felony charges in Chicago on 3/16/70 growing out of the October demonstra-

tions. The change on page 26 was made to include additional Laboratory

findings in regard to the Bel Air explosion.

Hoimes —

Gandy -

Director has accepted Attorney General's luncheon invitation

for Friday, September 8. Pertinent items of possible interest for discussion

at luncheon include:

(1) The Attorney General (AG) called Mr. DeLoach on 9-5-67 concerning

FBI's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. AG said he

had contacted Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at White House and also planned to

meet with Dick Helms of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter

of National Security Agency (NSA). AG said Clifford and Rostow were surprised

FBI had so little coverage--and they hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use

surveillances, it might be good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic

to bring Clifford and Rostow around, but FBI would come out ahead and he (the

AG) would have more liberal hand in approving FBI requests.

Regarding above, Mr. DeLoach noted it would be premature to

talk with Rostow or Clifford now; but after a decision has been reached, they

could be confidentially briefed on such FBI operations. Intormation confidentially

obtained reflects that Helms of CIA had a meeting scheduled with AG on 9-6-67--

the subject of which probably was electronic surveillances.

FBI has 31 telephone surveillances in FBI cases;

JFK Act 6 (1) (C)

(2) On 7-19-67, the House passed H.R. 421, which provides federa

penalties for interstate travel with intent to incite a riot. Many persons question

its practical and legal usefulness due to difficulty in proving intentur sources

on the Hill indicate there is a hope the bill may be bottled up in committee--but

that it'will pass the Senate if it reaches the floor. We took no stand on the bill

with the Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel to areas where

strife developed. The bill could increase our investigative responsibilities

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(3) On 8-8-67, the House passed H.R. 5037, the Law Enforcement and:

• Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the Administration's "Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act'} -but with considerable changes. One amend-

ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police

training--thus duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This matter

has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee.

Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine

their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and

add this to H.R. 5037.

(4) AG has indicated desire to achieve about 400 convictions in organized

crime field during this fiscal year. As of 9-7-67, a total of 382 individuals in

this field were awaiting Federal prosecution, By letter of 7=27-67, ve called the

AG's attention to a situation wherein 23 persons arrested in New York for gambling

law violations in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive action. To date, no

Areply has been received from AG.

(5) Latest two issues of "Life" magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith,

former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well

as their political affiliations, and the need or electronic surveillances to cope

with organized crime. Smith has extensive background and contacts qualifying

him to write on organized crime. It is obvious he obtained help from such persons

as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre Dame, formerly in the Organized Crime

Section of Department.

(6) The "task force" organized under direction of Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section of Department conducted an operation against bookmaker

Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs

Service that the Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart's

activities. According to ofticials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys

and others on the "task force" appeared at the police department and "took over"

lentire investigation. "Task force" was so inept that it "blew" the case against

Reinhart, and "task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinhart and

associates. Although Reinhart's gambling activities were across state lines from

New York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were

brought to AG's attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requested that "task force"

be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction.

M. A. Jones To Bishop Memo

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(7) For first month July) of new fiscal year, FBI convictions

decreased 189, or 22 percent. Decrease primarily due to: (a) shortage of

judges and prosecutors, resulting in overcrowded court conditions, and (b)

policy enunciated by Department's Criminal Division to reduce Federal

prosecutions of juvenile offenders. In July, 1966, Assistant AG Vinson sent

letter instructing U. S. Attorneys regarding diversion of subjects under age

21 to local authorities--which has principally been felt in Interstate Trans-

portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle violations, where experience indicates

decreased 109 in July.--

196% compared with July, 1966. For sometime,

ve have been advising AG whenever shortages of Federal judges or shortages

in U. S. Attorneys Offices exist.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information in connection with the Director's luncheon

with the Attorney General on Friday, September 8, 1967.

ADDENDUM BY C. D. DeLOACH (CDD; hmm 9/7/67):

The Coordinator of

U. S. Attorneys,

John W. Kern, III, stopped DeLoach in the

Attorney General's Office on ne morning of 9/7/67 and posed two

questions: (1) Sioula u. S. Attorneys attend meetings of Federal

Executive Boards (groups composed of all Federal agencies in

various metropolitan areas) when meeting on monthly basis (2) If

U.S. Attorneys joined and attended such

meetings, should these

U. S. Attorneys comply with

Kern was told that it was, of course, desirable to have

U.S. Attorneys participate in civic affairs but that U.S.

Attorneys should not attempt to sponsor one-day seminars on the

subject of law enforcement inasmuch as this would only promote

contusion and chaos. kern was also told that the fBi is already

DETAILS:

The Director has accepted an invitation for a luncheon with the

Attorney General on Friday, September 8, 1967. There is contained in this

memorandum succinct data concerning pertinent items which might be of

interest for discussion on this occasion. The General Investigative, Special

Investigative and Domestic Intelligence Divisions have contributed salient

information for this memorandum.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES:

On 9-5-67, the Attorney General called Mr. De Loach regarding

the Bureau's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. He

said he had finally made contact with Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at the

White House on 8-31-67 and that he planned to meet with Dick Helms of the

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter of the National Security

Agency (NSA) regarding this matter. The Attorney General said Clifford and

Rostow knew little about electronic surveillances and were very surprised that

the FBl had so little such coverage. He said that Clifford and Rostow, without

saying so, hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use surveillances, it might

be a good idea to transter FBI responsibilities in domestic intelligence to CIA.

The Attorney General said he was opposed to this idea. He

said it would take a little time to bring. Clifford and Rostow around but that he

believed the Department and the FBI would come out ahead in the discussions

and that he, the Attorney General, will then have a more liberal hand in

approving requests from the FBI. In this connection, Mr. De Loach noted

that it would be premature to talk with Clifford or Rostow at this point but

after a decision has been reached, these two individuals could be briefed on

a confidential basis regarding such FBI operations." It was also noted that it

did not appear the Attorney General could adequately represent the FBI in his

discussions with Clifford and Rostow.

We have confidentially obtained the information that Richard

Helms, Director of the CIA, had a meeting scheduled with the Attorney General

at 5 p.m., on Wednesday, September 6, 1967, and that the subject of the

meeting was probably electronic surveillances.

M. A. Jones to Bishop

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

At the present time the Bureau has the following electronic

surveillances in operation: (1) In Bureau cases, 31 telephone surveillances;

JFK Act 6 (1) (C)

,As of this date, there are four telephone surveillances pending

approval by the Attorney General with subjects and dates of request to the

Attorney General as follows: Ralph Alan Dale, since 3-27=67; Charles Morris,

since 7-25-67; Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, since 8-2-67;

Frederick Douglas Andrews, since 8-14-67. In addition, we-have a request

for FBI assistance on behalf ACt 6(

н.

This bill was passed by the House on 7-19-67. It provides for

Federal prosecution of persons who travel interstate with the intent to incite

ariot. Its practical and legal usefulness has been questioned by a number of

people, including many Senators, due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining

evidence to prove intent. Our Hill sources have advised there was a hope the

Bill could be bottled up in committee unless it could be changed to make it

more practical. These sources concede the Bill will pass the Senate without

difficulty it it reaches the floor because many Senators would consider it

politically unwise to vote against it.

We took no stand on the Bill with the

Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel by militant Negroes

and hate group leaders to areas where strife developed. The Bill, if passed,

could substantially increase our investigative responsibilities, depending, of

course, on the policy established by the Department.

H. R. 5037, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE

АСТ OF 1967:

This is the Administration's bill, originally called the Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act, although it has been changed considerably by

Republican-sponsored amendments made when the House passed the bill on

8-8-67. One of these amendments by Congressman Robert McClory (R.-I.)

which changed

Title 3 of the Bill, would empower the regional institutes to

engage in police training. This would duplicate and compete with the extensive

police training program we conduct on our own and in cooperation with local

and state agencies. This has been brought to the attention of our friends on

the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of them have voiced agreement and

stated they will take the necessary action to correct this wrong. Our Hill

sources have advised that Senator John McClellan (D. -Ark.) and Senator Roman

Hruska (R. -Neb.) plan to combine their bills authorizing controlled use of

wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and to add this to H. R. 5037 in Committee.

They feel wiretap legislation as a part of the Administration's crime bill will

have an excellent chance for passage and possible acceptance by the President.

ORGANIZED CRIME :

As of September 7, 1967, there were a tötal of 382 individuals,

involved in organized criminal activities, who have been arrested, indicted,

or awaiting further prosecutive action in connection with violations of

various Federal statutes.

By letter dated July 27, 1967, the Bureau called to the attention

of the Attorney General a situation where 23 individuals arrested in New York

for violations

of the gambling laws in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive

action. It was called to the attention of the Attorney General that prosecutive

action taken at the earliest possible date with reference to these individuals

would greatly assist in increasing accomplishments in the organized crime

field during the present fiscal year. To date no response from the Attorney

General has been received to this communication.

The Attorney General has indicated that he is desirous of

achieving in the.neighborhood of 400 convictions of individuals involved in

organized crime during this fiscal year. With 382 such subjects already

awaiting prosecution, the Attorney General's goal would appear to be readily

available if vigorous prosecutive action is taken of these individuals at the

earliest possible date by the Department.

"LIFE" MAGAZINE ARTICLE:

"Life" magazine has run articles for the last two weeks on

La Cosa Nostra, which articles were written by Sandy Smith, former crime

reporter for the "Chicago Tribune "* Smith has done an excellent job in these

articles in focusing public attention on the Cosa Nostra leaders as well as

their political affiliations and the need for electronic surveillances in order

to cope with the menace of organized crime.

Smith is an outstanding investigative reporter who has a

wealth of independent knowledge built up over the years on La Cosa Nostra.

He also has tremendous contacts among the local and state police intelligence

agencies throughout the country. In addition, it is obvious that he obtained

considerable help from such persons as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre

Dame, former Departmental Attorney in the Organized Crime Section, in

*and "Chicago Sun-Times. "

Patriarca matter, etc.

DEPARTMENT TASK FORCE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK:

In October, 1966, under the direction of the Organized Crime

and Racketeering Section of the Department, a "task force" was organized

as an investigative operation, supervised by Department Attorneys, and to

which were assigned representatives from various Federal investigative

agencies.

On August 21 and 23, 1967, the "task force" conducted

investigative activity, including physical surveillances in the Niagara Falls,

New York, area. The subject of its investigation was one Ernest Reinhart,

a bookmaker from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, who was said to be

making trips daily to Niagara Falls, New York, to establish regular contacts .

and gambling pickups from other known gamblers. The Niagara Falls, New

York, Police Department, which was also investigating the activities of

Reinhart, had requested the assistance of the United States Customs Service

to develop sufficient evidence to establish a violation of the local gambling

statute. A representative of the Customs Service notified the "task force"

representatives of the local police department's interest in this matter and

immediately thereafter, according to the officials of the Niagara Falls Police

Department, attorneys

and other members of the 'task force" appeared at the

police department.and "took over" the entire investigation.

SAC Neil J. Welch.of our Buffalo Office has since determined

from representatives of the Niagara Falls Police Department and the Customs

Service that the investigative activity of the "task force" was so inept that the

case against Reinhart was 'blown." (In conducting a surveillance the task force

utilized a panel truck and their actions, while in the panel truck, were such that

they caused the truck to rock back and forth revealing to the gamblers who were

watching: that people were inside the truck. Surveillances conducted by the

"task force, " including attorneys assigned thereto, were readily discovered by

Reinhart and his associates. Reinhart remarked to a customs agent at the

border crossing that he would give the investigators a good run around.

• Although Reinhart's gambling activities were being carried on

between Canada and the United States, that is across state lines, in apparent

violation of the Interstate Transportation in Aid of Racketeering Statute, the

FBI Office at Buffalo was not notified. The FBI has a substantial investigative

responsibility in the investigation of violations of this statute. In this

instance, Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and the local

Niagara Falls, New York, Police Department also have investigative

responsibilities.

Pertinent details concerning this matter were brought to

the attention of the Attorney General by our letter dated September 5, 1967,

with the request that necessary instructions be issued to the "task force"

personnel that matters within FBI jurisdiction be immediately reported to

our Buffalo Office.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - CONVICTIONS:

At the end of July, 1967, we had recorded 189 fewer con-

victions than were recorded during the first month of the prior fiscal year.

This represents a decrease of 22%, which is primarily the result of two

factors: (I) shortages of judges and prosecutors which result in over-

crowded court conditions and (2) the policy enunciated by the Criminal

Division of the Department to reduce prosecutions in Federal court relating

to juvenile offenders.

In this connection, our potential for increasing conviction

statistics was decimated as a result of a letter sent during July, 1966, by

Assistant Attorney General Vinson instructing all U. S. Attorneys to give

primary consideration to the diversion of subjects under 21 years of age to

local authorities. These instructions are being followed by a majority of

U. S. Attorneys and have hurt us principally in Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Motor Vehicle violations where experience has shown that approximately

65% of all violators are under 21 years of age. At the end of July, 1967, we

recorded 109 less convictions in this category as compared to the first month

in the previous fiscal year.

We have for sometime been following the practice of advising

the Attorney General whenever shortages of Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys

or their assistants exist,

For example, we recently sent the following letters

to the Attorney General bring to his attention shortages of judges or U. s.

Attorneys in the indicated areas:

9-1-67, Southern District of Georgia;

8-16-67, Eastern District of Michigan;

8-7-67, District of Kansas;

8-3-67, District of New Jersey;

8-2-67, Southern and Northern Districts of Mississippi;

7-31-67, Western District of New York.

M. A. Jones to Bishop

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

In connection with the situation in the Western District of

New York, we originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on

3-30-67 and we have received no information indicating that an appointment

has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity

has attended the failure to appoint a judge for this district.

With regard to the two vacant judgeships in the Eastern District

of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's

attention on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information

indicating these judgeships have been tilled.

Each SAC has been instructed to keep the Bureau currently

advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue

to bring these matters to the attention of the Attorney General.

As an example of shortages which have been brought to the

Attorney General's attention, in connection with the shortage of judges in

the Southern District of Georgia, it is noted that as of September 1, 1967,

there was a total of 87 Bureau cases awaiting prosecution involving 121

defendants. Of these 22 representing 32 subjects have been pending prose-

cution for more than six months.

It is also noted that in the District of New Jersey as of

July 1, 1967, there were approximately 200 Bureau cases awaiting prose-

cutive action involving approximately 392 defendants. Our New York Office

has also advised that it has 775 cases awaiting prosecution representing 874

subjects.

The following data concerning the antipoverty workers'

involvement in racial disturbances has been prepared for the

Director's information and possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference which will include the Attorney General and

: Mr. Shriver of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO).

ALLEGATIONS OF INVOLVEMENT OF ANTIPOVERTY EMPLOYEES

There have been a number of allegations regarding the

involvement of antipoverty employees in racial disturbances and

involving the misuse of antipoverty funds in connection therewith.

Allegations with respect to the misuse of these funds are

exceptionally difficult to substantiate because the funds provided

to local antipoverty agencies by 0EO or other Federal agencies are

usually furnished on a grant basis with the grants becoming the

property of the local group at which time the Federal character

Lof the funds is lost.

However, there have been instances wherein certain

officials and employees of local agencies receiving Federal anti-

poverty grants have reportedly not conducted themselves in a

manner conducive to law and order..

Examples follow.

New York City

area of New York City. Several of its employees are-known to 'have

Action Movement, a clandestine all-Negro revolutionary group

that calls for the overthrow of the U. S. Government by violence

and which is procommunist Chinese-oriented, were suspended as

employees of Haryou - Act following their arrest last June along

with a number of members of the Jamaica Rifle and Pistol Club,

a Revolutionary Action Movement front group,. on charges including

conspiracy to advocate anarchy. Another member of this rifle

club who was arrested, Arthur Harris, was also suspended as an

employee of an antipoverty organization in Jamaica, New York City,

which is funded by OEO. •

Newark. New Jersey

In Newark, antipoverty funds were reputedly utilized

by the United Community Corporation to rent two station wagons

used to transport people who had been encouraged to appear at

meetings at the city hall to protest action of a city planning

board. Reportedly, one of the vehicles was equiped with a loud-

speaker and was used to make inflammatory remarks regarding the

incumbent city administration. Also, it is reported that

inflammatory posters prepared by the

United Community Corporation

had been circulated.

Syracuse, New York

Employees of the Crusade for Opportunity, an antipoverty

agency funded by OEO, are alleged to have been involved in the

racial disturbances which occurred in Syracuse, New York,

8/16-18/67. An officer of the Syracuse Police Department advised

that a Crusade for Opportunity automobile bearing U. S. Government

license plates was used by two Negro males and two Negro females

to cruise through Negro neighborhoods in Syracuse on 8/15/67.

They utilized a loudspeaker to advertise a meeting on 8/16/67

regarding *the alleged rape of an 11-year-old Negro girl by a

white man.

A field worker of this organization, Leroy Glenn Wright,

was arrested during the first night's disturbance on 8/16/67 and

charged with inciting to riot and resisting arrest.

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

Washington, D. C.

Individuals affiliated with two organizations funded

in part by OEO were involved in the disturbance which occurred

in the House of Representatives on 8/7/67 in protest of the

shelving of the so-called "Rat Bill." The leader, Jesse Gray,

a former Communist Party organizer in Harlem and a militant black

nationalist, is the head of the Harlem Back Street Youth, Incor-

porated, which was the recipient of OEO funds. Such funds have

since been suspended. Gray and at least one other member of the

above organization were arrested for their part in this disturbance.

Also involved in this disturbance and arrested was Robert Bailey

Ransom, an employee of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)

Associates, an OEO-funded organization.

Hate-type Schools

The New York City Police Department advised on 8/9/67

that the walls of a school handling a program entitled "Special

Training in Reading" for children 8

to 10 years of age contained

numerous hate slogans.

Examples of the signs noted thereon were

"Don't love them to death, shoot them to death; make revolution

not war; burn, baby, burn; arm yourselves; Johnson is losing

sleep; Newark, '67; Chicago South Side, '66; Watts, '65, and

Harlem, '64." There was also a picture of President Johnson's

face superimposed on an Army sergeant carrying a rifle captioned

"Public Enemy Number One, Wanted for Murder."

The committee

handling this particular

program was funded

in part by OEO.

A somewhat similar situation occurred in Nashville,

Tennessee, in connection with a "Liberation School" which has

been in operation teaching 10 and 11-year-olds.

Antipoverty

funds from OEO had been earmarked for the school; however, the

funds were"withdrawn when national publicity resulted concerning

this matter.. Meantime, however, certain services including the

rental of an automobile and school supplies had been furnished.

MISUSE OF FBI INFORMATION BY OEO

In connection with the recent arrest by Kentucky

authorities of Alan and Margaret McSurely, employees of the

Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph I. Mulloy, an

employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state

sedition charge, someone in OEO apparently leaked to the press

a report prepared by an OEO investigator which contained state-

ments attributed to the FBI. An article concerning this matter

appeared in the 9/1/67 issue of "The Evening Star."

The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous

protest with OEO concerning the fact that information appearing

in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published in "The Evening

Star." In approving this action, he noted "Yes, and if they

can't or won't give us the necessary assurances

against leaks,

we will cut off all investigative services to OEO."

Such a protest was lodged through liaison with

Mr. Edgar May, Assistant Director, OEO, on 9/5/67 who advised

that steps had been taken to insure that such did not recur

in the future. A detailed memorandum is attached.

STATEMENTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED LAW AND ORDER

While no direct evidence has come to the Bureau's

attention of outright seditious statements on the part of anti-

poverty workers, allegations have been received of statements

against established law and order and of statements tending to

incite the people. Examples follow:

Marion S. Barry, Jr., former Washington Director of

the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, joined the United

Planning Organization, Washington, D. C., as a $50-a-day consultant

on 7/21/67. This organization is funded by OEO. On 6/30/67. Barry

reportedly conducted a press conference on the steps of the 13th

Precinct, Metropolitan Police Department, at which time he

denounced the Police Department and stated that Negroes would

continue to threaten the police until policemen are trained

-properly in how to deal with Negroes.

Captain Al Prezio of the

(Troy, New York, Police Department, advised on 8/25/67 that

Freeman Robinson, an employee of an antipoverty organization

funded by OEO, uses the office of the antipoverty organization

as a headquarters to conduct militant civil rights work and to

recruit teen-agers to incite riots and arouse a Negro community

Jon any issue that would create racial unrest.

Willie Wright, a duly-elected board member of the

United Community Corporation, Newark, New Jersey, is alleged

to have made statements concerning Negro rioting such as "To

hell with President Johnson when he says something about not

tolerating riots. We've tolerated these conditions for more

than 400 years."

He is also quoted as having said: "It is my

firm conviction that in order to overcome the white man's complete

human and legal jurisdiction over my black brothers and sisters,

we are going to defend ourselves against all kinds of aggressions

that are being perpetrated against us by the white man. I most

emphatically want to make sure the majority of my black brothers

and sisters have a piece of firepower in their home possessions

to protect themselves against the most brutal atrocities to be

seen anywhere committed by the New Jersey National Guard, the

Newark and State Police in the recent rebellion in the City of

Newark." The OEO has requested Wright's suspension pending its

investigation of statements attributed towright.

"The Washington Post" of 9/13/67 contained an article

by Columnist Roscoe Drummond captioned "Mayors Say 0EO Programs

Helped Suppress City Riots" in which he refers to a nationwide

survey conducted by 0E0 in 64 cities, half of which had riots

this summer. In citing OEO figures he pointed out that of 30,000

Community Action employees only 16 were arrested during the course

of the riots and none were convicted. Poverty programs. had 244

buildings in the hearts of the riot areas with none being burned

or destroyed.

possible sabotage in connection with the three captioned vessals of

the

United States

Navy:

Between 9-28-59 and 10-19-59 numerous cuts were found in

the electrical cables of the nuclear submarine "Nautilus," which was

being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

On 11-12-59 foreign

material was found in a pump on the "Nautilus." The Boston Office

has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500 ship-

yard employees, submitted numerous cut cables for Laboratory examination

and used

the polygraph in connection with pertinent interviews:

On 1-5-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing

cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser

"Long Beach,"

which is being constructed at Quincy, Massachusetts.

These

contain no identiiying marks for Laboratory comparison

with tools.

As of 1-14-00,

2,144 of over 5, 000 employees

having

access to this vessel had been interviewed.

On 12-28-59,

21 cuts were

found in the fire control wiring

of the guided missile

frigate "Luce," which is also being constructed

at Quincy, Massachusetts.

This damage was not reported to us or to

the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-00 as the damage was

originally

considered probably inadvertent.

In view of the

other

two cases involving cut cables, the Boston Office has opened an

investigation on this matter also.

The type of damage involved or the lack of any attempt to

hide or disguise the damage may be inoicative al employees attempting

to create more work or of disgruntled Navy personnel.

The Boston

Office has been instructed to afford these cases vigorous intensive

investigation.

subject of a great deal of discussion

between the lax Division and the treasury department.

The Goldfine tax fraud investigation, according to

our treasury sources, is scheduled to go before grand jury in

Boston next month. Goldfine and his nine New Inglona companies

owe the Government approximately eight million dollars.

and fraud penalty, 50% You will recall that the approximate

jigure appeared

in the newspapers and the Goldfine dejense

charged that this was an attempt on the part of the Governent

to try its case in the newspapers. No action was taken by

Treasury to look into this alleged leak of information on the

request of the lax Division of Justice since the total figure of

Goldfine's delinguency had been discussed with Goldfine and his

tax aitorneys. It was felt that they could have planted the

story in the press. Internal Revenue Service (IRS, has also

The investigation hos not developed any criminal.

The report does rejlect

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

Following the supreme Court decision in the Greene

case

:on June 29, 1959, prolonged ejjorts to prepare a

Presidential Directive

to establish a program under which

private contractors may be granted access to classified data

have culminated in a draft order dated January 7, 1950.

Budget is circulating this draft to all interested agencies.

The more recent Bureau comments concerning this matter were

by memorandum to the Attorney General,

Messrs. Halsh and leagley, January 6, 1960; ву memorandum,

January 11, 1960, to hr. Teagley; and by memorandum of

January l4, 1960, to Assistant Attorney General Kramer, with

сору to mr. reagley. The last two of these communications

both concerned the same draft which is now being circulated

by Budget.

In brief, we have noted that under the proposed Order

agencies may consider all of the pertinent information available

regardless of source. Under Section 1 4 1 protection is

afforded to regular confidential informants. Under Section 4 A.2

information from persons other than current informants may be

considered if they cannot appear due to death, severe biness,

or some such other good and sufficient cause.

It is apparent

that information from casual informants who refuse to testify

cannot be used under this section.

Section 5 B, according to Nr. leagley, would allow

use of data from wire taps, microphones, and other sensitive

techniques..

hir. reagley has indicated, however, that such

data would have

to be produced in the form of actual quotations

from. the conversations

rather than the paraphrased form in

which we disseminate this information.

Webelieve it will not

be possible for us to furnish other than paraphrased information

in most instances because of the absolute necessity of protecting

our sources.

• Even though data from casual informants and sensitive

techniques may not be used

as indicated above,. section 9 of the

Order grants and affirms the department head concerned authority

62-77855

HH 55176 DooId:32989646 Page 1032

---

## Page 1033

to exercise control over the Nation's military and defense

secrets and nothing in the rest of the order is deemed to

limit or affect his responsibility and powers in this regard.

Use of such authority and power will permit the department

head to act in those instances in which derogatory data is

available but cannot be utilized under the procedures established

in the balance of the order.

We have observed to the Department

that it has undoubtedly considered the public reaction should it

turn out that it is necessary to use this summary power in a

majority of cases.

We have several times reiterated that FBI wi1l

respect the confidence placed in it by both regular informants

or other persons and will not disclose their identity without

their specific permission.

Ve have summarized by stating

that from our stanapoint,

the Order as drafted, will permit

us to furnish all available data to appropriate agencies as in

the past and provides appropriate protection for our confidential

informants. .

Data from any casual informants and from highly

sensitive

techniques will largely be usable only under section 9.

We have stated that the bureau does not object to the proposed

Order from an operational standpoint.

On January 14, John Doherty of the Department informed

us of a very minor addition, proposed by Philip Areeda of the

White House, which was discussed in memorandum of January 15:

This addition would not affect the comments we have previously

made concerning this Order.

Ine cases involve the President's Civil Rights Commission

which was established by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1957

to investigate charges of citizens being discriminatorily deprived

The question raised for the supreme Court

Commission to conduct hearings wherein state registrars and

private citizens accused of depriving others of the right to vote

are denied notice of charges against them and confrontation.

Although the hearings held by the civil Rights

commission are investigative rather than judicial or punitive

such as the normal Government hearing, the argument and the

could shed some light

on the issue of confrontation as

This matter involves the reported contributions by

Most of the contributions involved were apparently nade from

Contributions from such accounts would not normally constitute

violations of Section 610, Title 18, U. S. Code; however,

with respect to this case, the Department by memorandum of

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES;

JOSEPH ABRAMS

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General

on 12-31-59 It relates to the association between Ledes,

former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Commissioner James Co Sargent

and Abrams, a New York promoter of

unsavory reputation.

Ledes resigned from Reynolds and

Company,

New York brokers, on 1-28-60.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files throughout

the, country and have interviewed numerous

persons in and out

of SEC who handled cases involving Abrams! firms. We determined

that Ledes endeavored

to assist Abrams

in several SEC matters

while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams made loans to

Ledes relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes..

These

loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and

thus

bring their relationship within the scope of Conflict of Interest

Statutes.

SEC Commissioner Sargent, who originally denied knowledge

as to any connection between Ledes

and abrams, has since improved

his memory considerably and now feels he may have been taken

advantage of by Ledes.

Sargent finally furnished a signed state-

ment as to his recollection of these matters on 2-5-60.

Sargent

told us that Ledes had been in touch with tony russo who had

arranged for former Attorney General Brownell

to talk to Attorney

General Rogers in July, 1958, about Sargent's ambition at the time

to become U.S. Attorney for

the Southern District of New Yorko

We have been told that both Ledes and Abrams were associated with

Russo, ex-confidential assistant to Brownell. Russo has not been

alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter.

Arrangements are now being made to interview subject

Ledes in New York City. Arrangements are also being made to

interview subject Abrams who is serving a 30-month sentence on

DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS AT WOODNER HOTEL

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

Hucks, chief telephone operator at the Woodner

Hotel, was indicted December 2, 1959, along with her

assistant, Davis, for having obstructed justice by

destroying records of the Woodner Hotel (telephone toll

tickets concerning calls to and from Teamster officials)

which had been subpoenaed by the McClellan Committee.

The grand jury here in the District, which was hearing

this case, has been recessed for several days and it is

not expected to resume hearings until later this month.

Upon resumption of the hearings, it is expected that

additional testimony will be taken from co-defendant Davis,

who appeared briefly at her own request before the grand

jury during the week beginning February 1, 1960.

The additional hearings are aimed at developing

further information showing that subject Hucks committed

perjury before the McClellan Committee in denying ownership

of a fur stole we located in Falls Church, Virginia. This

stole allegedly was received by hucks from James Hoffa

and/or the Teamsters Union.

CRASH OF NATIONAL AIRLINES FLIGHT 967

GULF OF MEXICO, NOVEMBER 16, 195.9

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR MOTOR

VEHICLES

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

On November 16, 1959, a plane with 42 persons aboard,

owned by Delta Air Lines but staffed with a National Airlines

crew, plunged into the Gulf of Mexico while on a flight from

Jampa, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana.

Only ten of the

victins were identified and the other bodies have not been

recovered.

On January 17, 1960, ve initiated a full-scale

investigation in this matter.

It had

been alleged

that

Dr. Robert V. spears, an ex-convict with a long criminal

induced his friend

Florida, to board the plane in his place.

Taylor of Tampa' $100,000 worth of insurance with his vife

had over

as

veneticiary and laylor purchasce 40r,500 worth or flight

insurance just prior to the trip with his son as beneficiary.

From the first, our investigation was directed at

finding Spears or Taylor since this appeared to be a key point

in our investigation.

Spears was located by Bureau Agents in

Phoenix, Arizona, on

January 20, 1yot,

and charged with the

Motor Vehicle (ITSIV).

Spears admittca Taylor took his place on the ill-fated plane

and that following

the crash he, Spears, tried to conceal his

identity. He took Taylor's car, with his alleged permission,

but admitted he had no authority to take it to Arizona and

that he and his friend, Dr. William Turska, removed the

identification number from it and tried to

get a fraudulent

title for the car.

Spears, with Turska, contacted Mrs. Spears

• in Dallas, Texas,

about January 7, 1960, and Mrs. Spears

admitted

that her husband persuaded her not, to reveal the

fact that he was alive so that the insurance policies could

be paid to her as beneficiary.

On January 20, 1960, when Spears was arrested in

Fhoenix, Arizona,

he was charged with the Interstate Transportation

a Stolen Motor Vehicle for

taking layior's car from florida to

Arizona.

tle was taken to the J.".

commissioner in whoenix of

that date and held on 435,00u bong.. On February 1, 1960, Spears

was brought before the J... District Judge in Phoenix and

55176 DocId:32989646 Page 1043

---

## Page 1044

charged by information with the interstate transportaion of Taylor's automobile.

Spears waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty. His bond was continued

at $35, 000, and February 15, 1960, was set as the date for sentencing.

Physical evidence from the crash is extremely sparse. Since the

examination of the limited physical material found did not indicate an

explosion or the reason for the crash, it was hoped that the plane could

be located in the Gulf. If the plane could be found and examined, it might

reveal some definite physical evidence of the cause of the crash, particularly

if a bomb was involved. On January 28, 1960, salvage operations were begun

by the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico after sonar contact had located an object

which was thought to be the plane. On February 5, 1960, however, the Navy

discontinued salvage operations without locating the downed aircraft.

Following an interview with an abortionist in Dallas, Texas, who

formerly associated with Dr. Spears, the Miami. Office advanced the theory

that Spears might have been in Tampa on November 13 to 15, 1959, for

the purpose of preparing an abortion formula through a process which involves

the cooking of dynamite to obtain nitroglycerin, and that Spears might have

prevailed on Taylor to transport the formula to Dallas by plane in Spears'

place. The explosion, if there was one, might have resulted from an

accidental explosion of the abortion formula. The Laboratory has considered

this theory and has advised that it knows of no instance of the use of

nitroglycerin in preparations utilized to produce abortions. In addition,

during a reinterview with the Dallas abortionist, he advised that all of

the ingredients used by Spears in his abortion formula were stable and not

volatile or explosive.

All persons contacted in this investigation have denied any knowledge

of the wilful destruction of the plane. Nevertheless our investigation is being

pressed to determine full facts and to uncover any violations of Federal laws

which might have occurred. The United States Attorney at Phoenix has been

kept fully advised and has under consideration the question of whether a

prosecutable Federal case for mail fraud exists against Dr. Spears, his wife

and/or Dr. Turska.

As of February 8, 1960, twenty-five investigative reports in this case

have been made available to the Department and to the Civil Aeronautics Board.

The body was mangled and the lower

portion of the left arm and of both legs were missing. His luggage,

Pathologists who examined Irank's body have aduised thai his body

cannot dejinitely identify them as such.

According to the pathologists,

similar wounds have jeen observed on victims of land mine explosions.

are not conclusive and additional maierial from the scene of the crash

will be examined as received uy the FBI Lacoratory in an effort to

reach a definite conclusion.

Extensive investigation of the activities of Frank has failed

to develop any direct evidence to date that he was responsible for

the crash.

of his associates is continuing. Thirty-tuo investigative reports haue

been dissemirated to the Devartment and to the civil seronautios Board.

SABOTAGE

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving

possible sabotage to three vessels of the United states Navy.

•Between 9-38-59 and 10-19-59, 279 cuts were found in the

electrical cables of the nuclear submarine "Nautilus,

which was

being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

It has been determined

The Boston

Office has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1, 500

As many of the damaged cables as could be made

available by the Navy have been submitted for Laboratory examination

and additional specimens are being submitted when they can be made

the interviews of suspect individuals and additional interviews using

the polygraph are being arranged.

on 1-15-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing

cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser

"Long Beach," which is being constructed at quincy, Massachusetts.

These cuts contain no identifying marks for Laboratory comparison

with suspect tools. An average of 2,700 employees worked on this

vessel daily and a total of approcimately 5,000 employees hod access

to it.

Over 3,100 individual employees have been interviewed and

interviews are continuing.

21 cut wires were found in the fire control

wiring of the guided missile frigate "Luce"

, Which is also under

construction at Quincy, Massachusetts.

This damage was not reported

to us or to the office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-50 as the

damage was originally considered inaduertent. Over 14, 000 employees

hàd access to the vessel.

The employees assigned to the area of the

danage have been identified and are being interviewed.

Other employees

known to have worked in the area are also being interviewed. The

damaged wires have been forwarded to the IBI Laboratory for examination.

In connection with the damage on the "Long Beach" and "Luce"

supervisory employees have expressed the opinion that this damage is

of the nuisance and malicious mischief type rather than sabotage as the

damage was not hidden and was readily apparant.

The Boston Office has

been instructed that daspite these statements this donage has been

reported to us by the Nauy as sabotage and an intensive, exhaustive

investigation must be conducted to identify the subjects.

Investigation concerning

the "Long Beach" and "Luce" has

been delayed by a strike at the shipyara where these vessels are

under construction which began 1-23-50.

Management representatives

have been unable to enter the shipyard due to the picket line and

thus personnel is not available to furnish the names and addresses

of employees particularly those who worked aboard the "Long Beach"

and are still employed.

The Boston Office has been able to secure

the names and addresses of terminated employees assigned to work

on. the

"Long Beach" and is interviewing them. .

The Boston Office has been instructed to afford these cases

vigorous,

intensive investigation.

Reports are being disseminated to

the Department and the Office of Naval Intelligence in all three cases

and to the Atomic Energy Commission in the cases involving the two

nuclear vessels.

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

On February 2, 1960, the House passed H.R. 8121,

introduced by ur. Halter, which would authorize the secretary

of Dejense to establish a program for soreening employees

of private contractors for access to classified information.

The bill states that procedures prescribed

by Defense sholl

be designed to protect from disclosure all information which,

in the opinion of the secretary of Defense, would affect the

to compromise investigative sources or investigative methods.

The bill has been referred to the senate Committee on the

Judiciary and, if passed, would permit Defense to reinstitute

the same program which was in effect at the time of the

supreme Court decision in the Greene Case. Defense could,

nowever;

institute a new program offering a maximum of con-

frontation while protecting sources or techniques in accordance

with the terms of the bill

On February 5, 1960, Assistant Attorney General Yeagley

•jorwarded a new drajt of the proposed executive order in this

matter and stated it was the result of meetings with the attorney

General and the Mite House and that he hoped that it would

be the final draft. This draft introduced four major changes.

123229

The first of these would permit use of information

from a so-called "casual" informant without confrontation if the

informant could not appear due to death, sèvere illness, or

some other cause determined bu the head of the depariment to

be good and sufficient.

The underlined words have been added

and would considerably broaden the circumstances under which

information from suoh a source might be used.

A second change, however, would require that when

an exception to confrontation was granted in the case of death

or severe illness, as indicated above; the identity of the

source be disclosed to the applicant.

This requirement would

apply only in the case of death or severe illness and would not

apply to the new exception discussed in the previous paragraph.

We have repeatedly told the department that we must respect the

12-975 56-16

HW 55176 DocId:32989646 Page 1048

---

## Page 1049

confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us information

and that we will not disclose their identities without their

permission.

In the case of death or severe illness, we will

be unable to secure that permission and we do not understand

why this requirement has been added.

A thira change makes

it possible for either the

Attorney General or the Director to certify that an indiviaval

is a current confidential informant and that his disclosure

would be detrimental to the national security. The previous

draft required that this certification be made by the Attorney

General and we consider this preferable. If the head of the

investigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data

and, at the same time, to decide whether the applicant is to

have an opportunity to confront the source of that data, this

procedure may be criticized both by the public and the courts.

This matter was discussed with the department by Mr. Belmont

at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General's Office on

August 31, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a logical

standpoint and the standpoint of the supreme Court,

certification concerning the need to protect an informant's

identity should be made by the Aitorney General in the case

of the FBI or the appropriate department head in the case of

The fourth change clarifies the authority of the

department head to deny or revoke access to classified data

without regard to the balance of the order. Although the

previous draft granted this authority, the new language is an

improvement as it removes all possible doubt as to its meaning.

Our obseruations concerning the four changes,

summarized above, were forwarded to assistant Attorney Genera.

Memorandum to Mr. De Loach

Re: Director's Meeting with

Assistant Attorney General

Will R. Wilson

A number of case writeups are set forth which are believed

to be of interest to the Department, particularly AAG Wilson. Included

are fraud cases against the Universal Fibreglass Corporation (thirteen

million dollar contract to produce mail delivery trucks); Youth Pride,

Inc., Washington, D. C. payroll padding); Chromcraft Corporation

("'paper" corporations formed to act as subcontractors in connection

with production of rocket launchers for United States Navy).

Writeups are also submitted concerning financier Louis

Wolfson and his alleged dealings with Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas

based upon information furnished by the Internal Revenus Service;

the bribery case involving Congressman George H. Fallon (allegations

received that payoffs totaling $200, 000 were made to Congressman

Fallon and Lawson B. Knott, Jr., former General Services administrator,

in return for obtaining commitments for Government occupancy of

office buildings). Our New York Office developed information that a

theft ring existed at John F. Kennedy Airport, New York City, and

it is anticipated Federal Grand Jury will indict 15 to 17 individuals.

Attorney General Mitchell has reportedly expressed interest in this

case (Sidney Steinschreiber; And Others, Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Property).

ACTION:

This is submitted for information, and attached are more

detailed writeups concerning the above matters.

DETAILS:

ORGANIZED CRIME

ALBERT M. BILLITERI

EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS

Billiteri is a Buffalo, New York La. Cosa Nostra

member in the "family" of "Commission" member Steve Magaddino,

and operates a major loan-shark racket in the Buifalo area on

behalf of Joseph Fino, the "underboss" of the Magaddino family.

On 4/23/69, the Attorney General approved a recommendation for

microphone

and technical surveillance at two of Billiteri's

key locations where this illegal activity is carried on.

The

Attorney General authorized a Department Attorney to handle

the filing of affidavits with the Federal court in Buffalo,

New

Yorks to obtain the necessary court order for the

electronic surveillance sought, pursuant to Title 3 of the

Omnibus Crime Bill.

The Department Attorney, in conjunction

with our Buffalo office, was to make application to the court

on 4/28/69, the necessary affidavits to be filed by a Bureau

Agent. This is the first such application we have made

pursuant to the provisions of Title 3.

MANHATTAN JOINT STRIKE FORCE

The Department has proposed a strike force with the

stated objective of making a concentrated drive against

organized crime in the borough of Manhattan in New York City,

This apparently has been enlarged to include the Bronx in

view of the inclusion of the Bronx County District Attorney

on the Strike Force Council.

This strike force is to be

composed of Department Attorneys, members of the staffs of

the District Attorneys of New York and Bronx Counties, members

of the New York City Police Department and investigators from

the various Federal investigative agencies, including the FBI.

The Federal Government is to provide the office space and office

equipment. A supervisory council has been named to make

decisions of strategy and timing and approve all planning. The

members of the Council have been named as Assistant Director

in Charge John F. Malone of our New York office, the District

Attorneys of New

York and Bronx Counties, Police Commissioner

of New York City, Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson, the

ANTIRIOT LAWS

Chicago Cases

On March 20, 1969, the Federal Grand Jury at Chicago,

Illinois, based upon extensive Bureau investigations, returned

indictments against seven leaders of the New Left and one leader

of the Black Panther Party all of whom were charged with

Antiriot Laws violations in connection with the Chicago disturbances

at the time of the Democratic National Convention. Trial has been

set for September 24, 1969.

San Francisco Case

After extensive FBI investigation the Department commenced

grand jury proceedings on April23, 1969, at San Francisco in

connection with Antiriot Laws violations allegedly committed by

three Black Panthers who gave instructions in the use of firearms

and explosives during a conference held by the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco last November.

Philadelphia Case

We have conducted extensive investigation into Antiriot

Laws violations in connection with the Black Power Conference held

in Philadelphia in August and September, 1968. Approximately 3, 000

to 4, 000 Negroes from all over the country attended this conference

during which five subjects provided instruction in the use of firearms

and explosives for a closed meeting of approximately 70 persons.

Inauguration Disturbances

On April 18, 1969, the Department requested investigation of

fifteen subjects who allegedly came to Washington, D. C., on inauguration

day for the purpose of creating disorders. This investigation is being

conducted on an expedite basis.

Campus Disorders

At the present time there are also a number of Antiriot Laws

investigations being conducted with regard to recent campus disorders,

most notably at Brandeis University where two professors from San

Francisco State College allegedly contributed to the seizing of the •

Administration Building on January 8, 1969, and American University,

Washington, D. C., where members of the Students for a Democratic

Society allegedly traveled to Washington, D. C., and participated in

seizing a building on the campus on April 23, 1969.

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION

OF-STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

INVESTIGATIONS (DYER ACT)

In the fall of 1967, the former Attorney General and his

staff held conferences with various United States Attorneys (USA) •

here in Washington, D. C. Following these conferences, we learned

of a divergence of opinion among USAs concerning the Department's

views in prosecuting Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle

(ITSMV) cases. Some had the opinion that only automobile theft ring

cases should be prosecuted in Federal court while others were of the

opinion that only cases having commercial aspects should be considered

for such prosecution. Other USAs felt only cases possessing aggravated

circumstances should be considered. Some continue to consider each

case on its individual merits. During the period October, 1967,

through May, 1968, we wrote four letters to the former Attorney

General requesting the Department's views concerning the prosecution

of these cases. In a letter dated April 12, 1968, to the Department,

we set forth our views that prosecution of Dyer Act cases in Federal

court should not be restricted to commercial matters and to adults,

but rather that each case should be considered on its individual merits.

None of these letters were answered. On March 5, 1969, we wrote the

present Attorney General informing him of the divergence of opinion among

USAs. This letter also requested the Attorney General furnish us his

views concerning this matter; however, an answer has not been received

to date.

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF

THEFT FROM INTERSTATE SHIPMENT (TFIS)

CONSPIRACY

Captioned investigation concerns theft ring operating at

John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. Special

Prosecutor Daniel P. Hollman, Department of Justice Task Force, is

presenting evidence to Federal Grand Jury wherein 15 to 17 indictments

anticipated probably April 30, 1969. Organized Crime Section of the

Department of Justice and Attorney General Mitchell particularly interested.

In October, 1968, four individuals, including Steinschreiber

and Mario Alessi, were arrested by the FBI in connection with theft of

drugs. Since that time, Alessi, a Pan American Airways cargo

supervisor, has been cooperating and named others in connection with

pharmaceutical thefts amounting to over $100,000, as well as a series of

general merchandise thefts, such as furs, jewelry, and firearms

probably in excess of $250, 000 involved. Alessi has identified Raymond

Wood, U. S. Customs Examiner, as being involved. Wood has been

interviewed, but denies complicity. Customs Agency has been apprised

of Wood's alleged involvement.

This Bureau has long been aware of the serious problems of

thievery at airports in the New York metropolitan area, particularly at

John F. Kennedy International Airport.

Special Agents of this Bureau are

assigned on the scene at that airport and are actively handling investigations

• of violations within our jurisdiction. In performing our duties, we enjoy

close working cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, with

the airlines, and with the Airport Security Council formed in 1968 to

cope with these problems.

The Bureau feels the above program is essenticl

proximity to Communist China and Laos, the current ared

of political unrest. It is felt sources developed within

aiplomatic establishments of Thailand could furnish pertinent

inforsation regarding political conditions and political

trends in southeast asia unich would be of considerable

interest to other U.S. Gouermment agencies.

In regard to Ruth Naomi Burney, iD should open

a separate 134 investigation on her to develop additional

background infornation os required in section 107 of the

Hanual of Instructions to make certain she is type of person

we wurt to contadt as a sourse. If the investigation is

juvorable, submit your request to the Bureau for State

Department clearance to intervied her. Bear in mind that

when Burney is of no further interest to us, the Burecu

should so advise CIA.

NOTE:

Since State Department clearance has been received

for the Bureau to institute a program in developing live

sources within Thailand diplomatic establishments in the U.S.,

#FO and New York being so advised. State Department also

furnished clearance for very discreet investigations of

potential sources which we will select. In view of the

information received from CIA via liaison regarding Burney,

felt she is in a very good position for possible development as

a source of pertinent information regarding Thailand
