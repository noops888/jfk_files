FROM™ : Walter T. Lloyd :
Associate General Counsel

Mitchell Livingston Werbell, I

: i: SUBJECT

| te : 1, Asujoit are-aware, onthe instruction of United States
\eeaeeec erate District Judge Peter Fay (Miami, Florida Division), incident to
the Drug Enforcement Administration's prosecution of Subject
for conspiracy to import and distribute multi-ton loads of
eos marijuana, the undersigned made a detailed review of the files
of this Agency concerning Subject in August 1976. This exami-
nation was to asceftain any data that ran to Werbell's guilt or
Innocence of the offense charged and any other dats reflecting the :
fee inure of the relationship between Werbell and the U.S. Government.
: Pibteece This latter‘requirement was grounded on the Court's view that :
Wverbell’s voluntary reporting to the Agency and any government
ver donation of his activities might be exculpatory in the eyes of the

jury. : ;

2. In response, we reviewed the files, identified Agericy
contacts with Subject and prepared two affidavits: ont regarding
hon-employment by Mr. B. DeFelice ang the second regarding
Werbell's relationship to the Agency by the undersigned. Copies
ara attached. During the trial the first affidavit was shown to
counsel for Werbell by DEA counsel, Mr. Sam Sheres, at which
point defendant's counsel stipulated that Werbell was never a .

Formal employee of the Central Intelligence Agency Sheres
subsequently returned the affidavits to the undersigned at the
conclusion of the trial.

CL BY: 059605



3, Regarding the relationship of Werbeli to the Agency, as-
approved by the-Deputy Director, the undersigned appeared before
Judge Fay in his chambers on 31 August and under oath answered
questions of the Court concerning Werbell. A copy of thé transcript
of that proceeding is attached. You will note that Judge Fay requested
that all pertinent government records be made available to the Court
for its inspection. Accordingly, copies of Agency files were reproduced,
culled for "Brady-type” documents, excised to protect sources and
methods under the "SWP case criteria” and reviewed and approved by
Assistant DD/O-on the evening of | September. These processed
documents Were then handcarried to Miami by the undersigned on
2 September. :

4... The undersigned advised Judge Fay at 0830 hours on
2 September that'I had in my possession copies of all of the Agency

«files of Werbell, had-culled them as to possible-"Brady® documents
| sand was prepared to review them with the Judge at his convenience.
.. He was on the bench with a tight schedule and 2sxed that the possible

Brady documents first be reviewed by Karen Atkinson, the principal
counsel for the prosecution. The undersigned subsequently briefed
Atkinson on the nature of data in the possible Brady documents. This
resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possibles. The
undersigned gave Atkinson copies of the four unclassified OGC
documents related to the DOD revocation of Werbell's security clearance
in 1971. In addition, Office of Security documents edited and approved
for release to Werbell under his Freedom of Information and Privacy
Act.request.(Tabs A-and B of OS response), consisting of media
publications and security investigative data, were also provided
Atkinson. Due to counsel for Werbell raising an issue on Werbell's

use of a'boat named *Venus" belonging to CIA, 2 declassified copy

of the OS skort investigative report outlining data concerning Werbell's
use of the Venus to transport arms was also provided Atkinson. The
related OS Headquarters assignment document was rot provided.
Related DDO documents on the ownership-of Venus by the "JURE®
Cuban group were mentioned to Atkinson but not made available.

5. While the above decuments were provided the, Department of
Justice with the undérstanding they could be passed to Counsel for
Werbell due to subsequent events noted below, it is not certain that
this occurred. Specifically, the undersigned declined to release
additional "Brady® documents without consultation and instructions



ro) eg

from the Court. The requested meeting was put off by Judge Fay and
@efendante subsequently rested their case. ‘The DOJ had little else

ate add and the case went to the jury about noon on 3Sept.mber, AH
"the remaining copies of Agency ducuments were returried te Headquarters

by the undersigned the evening of 3 September. On'4 September the
jury returned_a verdict of "not guilty." Asa result, the bulk of
"Brady-type" Agency documents or Werbell was not provided to
counsel for!Werbell and Judge Fay reviewed no Agency documents.

It shold be noted all'copies of documents teken to Miami were excised
in-accord with the *SWP case criteria" and on return to Headquarters,
these were destroyed by the undersigned. E

6. Asa related matter, on 16 November Mr. Arthur Egbert
of the Interna! Security Division of the DEA contacted the undersigned

---seeking background information on Werbell. Tke undersigned suggested

‘st-review the files of the FBI on Werbell as ‘most of the data

Egbéi

< "Wye have is containéd in FBI reports. Should FBI data be insufficient

for his needs Isiiggested he seek access to our files in DDO and Office
of Security via the normal. DEA Department of Justice liaison channels.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SOG

SUBJECT 1° Mitchell Livingston Werbel Hit

: «1, Twas advised by the Justice Department on 23 February that
Werbel has beer indicted and the trial is scheduled to begin on. 29 March
in Miami, Florida’ The charges relate to importing and distributing
quantiti¢s of marijuana. With Werbel's propensity to raise his past
affiliations with the Agency, we can anticipate problems during this trial,
An additional problem is presented because Werbel is defended by Edwin
Marger who was tlé‘défense attorney for John Hawk in the B-26.case in
Buffalo, NewYork in 1966. It was Edwin Marger who subpoenaed the CIA

General Counsel as a*defense witness.

ea ee ages Department has.received information that a person
either currently or formerly affiliated with the CIA has been participating
[ in Werbel's meetings with his attorney. It would be appreciated if all
addressees could review their holdings on Werbel and determine if there
is any validity to any recent contacts with him. I would urge that instruc-
tions be sent to Miami that no, repeat no, contact with Werbel take place
between now and the beginning of the trial.

3. It would be helpful if each addressee edld prepare a summary
of the various contacts Werbel has had with CIA in the past. Please check
to see if you have any information on a Colonel Bayard who was killed in

: Atlanta, Georgia during the summer of 1975, Bayard, reportedly an
3 associate of Werbél's, had previous contacts with the ‘Agency. It would
be appreciated if your responses could he received by close of business
‘ 2 March,

iin

vcwar” get together only to make

hard-boiled “conversation about
“knocking off an entire republic”
with the aid-of World War II ma-
chine pistols laboriously concealed
in’ oil drums. WerBell’s world is

different. A top executive, of De

factures’ his own weaponry, which
are recugnized all over the world
as. the miost sophisticated small

chief of The New York Times.

depart. WerBell lights a finely

straight out of a Forsyth seripc:
the take-over of Abaco—an action
that will allow these men to get
themitelves and.their money profit
ably out of the US.

To be sure, any reséxblance to
popular fiction stops with the.
basic idea. Commando politics is,
dead. It will iio longer ‘do to break\
open a case of booties hand rre-|
nades and storm the palace. In fac
Abaco has no palace. What it does *
have is'six to seven thousand native
inhabitants who lead lives ranging
from quiet stagnation to mute
povéity. ;

‘To be conquered, Abaco must ‘be
attacked—that fundamental, aspect
of territorial ‘expansion has not
changed in four thousand years—
but in an age of psychological war-
fare, “motivational research: sub-

around the table is watehing him
with close attention, “They finally:

a one-spot run this Weekend-and see
how they score. They iv be
xixty to sixty-five percent.”

‘9 translation is needed. As the
Watergate tapes have demonstrat.
ed, men who share a secret scenario
come to share a.secret language, as
if by osmosis. Werllell's remarks
reveal that he has had a onz~dis-

powerful syndicate of financial

is making independence an immi-

Abaco, most of whom have never

Long before the Dow hit the five

very embodiment of the American
dream of success: a European im
migrant to the U.S. at eighteen, he
had made his first million by thirty
(realestate development, construc
tion) and 1965 saw him living-on a
charming wouded estate in Nevada,
with a pretty wife named Retty and
three lively children. Approaching
fifty, Oliver was the president of
seversl medium-sized corporations,
a settled, induential community
leader and the employer of a rav-
sly beautiful secretary named
Vicky Jo Todd, who was crowned
Miss Nevada in 1970, Yet for ale
most ten years, where other busi-
nessmen and economists saw only
Progress and prosperity, Oliver di-
vined a long-range trend toward de-
pression and disaster.

Worldwide travel and an intense
reading of economics helped con
e him by 1963 that, as he told
a visitor years later, “They're g0-

felt certain that debauchery of the
dollar would lead to political
inilation, and ultimately to. sume

“The person with self-respect has a

Oliver's book reassures the reader. “But
he has no duty to stuy in a country

The country Oliver is describing isn't

Thus, the freedom-loving "person has

: SUBJECT: Press Reports of Ex-CIA Employees Involvement with
Persons under Congressional Investigation

1, Press reports of Sentator Lowell P, Weicker's investigation of
CIA's involvement with othe r government agencies surfaced the contact
of Lucien Conein-of DEA, a former employce, with an electronic manu:
facturer named Michael Morrisey. The same reports have alsotied _
4, Morrisey with a Mr. Mitchell L, WerBell, Ill, who, according'to our”
“S' files, has claimed United States Government and “CIA connections in
the past. According to DEA, WerBell recently invoked the Fifth Amend
ment when appearing before Senator Jackson's Subcommittee investigating
DEA on whether or not he supplied arms to Robert Vesco. “Also, while
" not mentioned in the press, at least one retired CIA staffer and possibly |
two others may have been involved with Conein and-Morriscy. The ex-
staffer is John P. Muldoon, a friend of Conein's, who currently is a
Private’ security specialist who has dealt with Morrisey in the purchase
of audio sweeping devices for his business. Muldoon was retained by
WerBell curing first half of 1974. ‘The other two, Walter J, Mackem,
anvacquaintance of Conein's, anda Theodore J, Roussos, ‘bath of whom *
were in’ contact. with WerBell for possible employment in a scheme to
" -promote.the-secession of the Bahamian Island of Abaco, an enterprise
“publicized in February 1975 issue of Esauire by Andrew St. George.

~ 2, We have no information in our files on the B. R. Fox Company
or the Fox Company principals mentioned in the press acen
however, told by DEA that Mr. Sandy Smith, Time maxax
was working on a story to the effect that the late Bernard
owner of the Fox Company, was previously involved in "wire tapping for
the Teamsters Union and providing explosive devices for organized crime."
Although Mr, Smith did not allege that either CIA or DEA were assoc:
with the Fox Company or Svindel, our DEA source said that Mr. Smit
no intention of dropping the story and we can expect further press coverage.

In conclusion, there has Leen no CIA involvement with the
B. R, Fox Company or with Michael Morrisey. Moreover, Mr. WerBell'S
clairas of CIA affiliation or support over the years are simply not true.

Spindel,

Aras



SUBJECT: Mitchell Livingston WerBell HI (201-259910) oy

1, Mitchell Livingston WerBell, who appeared in recent press
reports has for over a period of ten years been claiming to be a
representative of the United States Government and of CLA. . The facts
do not support this contention.

2. .CIA first learned of WerBell in July of 1959 when he contacted
General Cabel indicating knowledge of Cuban and ‘Dominican affairs.
Mr. Thomas J. Flores of LA Division was put in contact with WerBell
onsidered using him as an Flassct. A POA was granted on
7 July 1959 for-this purpose. By October. 1959 it was apparent that he
did not have the access to information as hoped and he apparently looked
upon his association with CLA as a mean’ of furthering his various
business schemes. All contact was then severed.

3. From that time until the present Mr. WerBell has cropped up :
in a number of nefarious activities whereby he inferred he had CIA connections
or support, He was reported to have been involved in arms sales to
Nicaragua and Guatemala, in efforts to gain recognition by certain

South American countries of the Cuban Government in Exile, and in an
abortive scheme to invade the Republic of Haiti in 1966. He also turned

up in Thailand where he contacted the COS purportitig "to Counter-
insurgency expert. In 1971 the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
queried thé Agency re Mr. Werbcll, asking if WerBell ha¢ a contractual
agreement or association with the A: as Werbeil was awaiting a hearing
before a Department of Defense Examiner related to his participation in

the aboritve Haiti invasion. The Office of the General Counsel placed the
matter in perspective. Subsequently, he contacted the Agency to request
intercession on his behalf to have his security clearance reinstated which

.. DoD revoked because of his Haitian caper. He was told this, could not be)

dla

done. In1971 he again appeared in Thailand attempting to sei! arr
1973 ke was under investigation by U.S. Treasury
Tobacco and Firearms and by the United States Customs Service for activities
relating to possible mercenary activities in Abaco Island, B Ini

‘em and Theodere Rousses
ne activities
advocating the se:

fan organization called the F
ion of the island from the Commonwealth of Bahamas,

3.3R |



All three inviduals reported their involvement with the WerBell group
and had sought guidance from th: Agency. In May and June they were
advised to break all ties with WerBell. Gn 27 June 1974 the FBI was
formally apprised of WerBell's overtures for their collaboration in

the effort'to bring:Abaco's secession. In September 1974 WerBell
reportedly went to Greece to sell amé to the Greek Government.

Most recently WerBell reportedly appeared before Senator Jackson's
Sub-Committee investigating DEA and had taken the Filth Amendment”
‘on the question of whether or not he had supplied arms to Robert Vesco.

Sen. Lowell P, Weicker
Jr. R-Conn., disclosed
today that Lucian Coneia,

director of special projects

for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, viewed the”
equipment manufactured
by the now-defunct Alexan-
dria electronics firm. But
Conein denies he ever even
considered buying any of
the equipment.

Weicker released a cata-
logue of the devices which
included such things a8 ex-
Ploding cigarette. packages
and. electronic booby traps
for telephone receivers. ‘The
eculpment was manufac:
tured by the B. RB.
Laboratories, which Weick.
er said went outof business
three weeks tgo.

THE SENATOR, o for-

Concin’s involvement in the
incident raise serious new
questions about the opera-
tions of federal law enforce-
ment and intelligence agen-
cies. .

He also quéstioned ‘a
statement by Conein that

chase only electronic eaves.

MEMORANDUM FOR-THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with Theodore Roussos on 31. August 1974

1, During subject meeting Mr. Roussos told me that
Mr. Mitchell Livingston WERBELL ILI called him from Atlanta
son 29-August and again. on 30° August. Werbell told Roussos
“tnat he-was-leaving. for Athens on Saturday, 31 August in
order to try to sell arms to the Greek government. wWerbell
wanted, Roussos. to -be his advisor in this venture.and to
go to Athens. Werbell indicated that the total-deal could
reach $5,000,000. Roussos told Werbell that he would
check with his "friends" (the Agency) before giving
Werbell an answer. wWerbell asked Roussos to see if his
“friends” were in favor of such arms deals or not. Roussos
had generally explained this call to me on the telephone
on 29 August. My reaction on the telephone was negative
-to Roussos’ participation in such a deal, and he had
conveyed this negative reply to Werbell by telephone
before: Roussos and [I met personally on 31 August.

2. During our personal meeting, Roussos explained
that Werbell intended to pursue arms sales legally and
via the required U.S. Government channels. He said that
Werbel] does have the capabilities to design and produce
weapons because of his access to arms factories, I told
Roussos that Werbell's businesssactivities were his own
concern, i strongly advised against his getting involved
in this deal. I explained to him the problems which the
U.S. Government was having in Greece and the current wave
of anti-Americanism and press attacks against the CIA.

If Roussos.as a former C1A offtcer well known in Greece
became involved fn sucn a venture, a flap of substantial
proportions was likely complete with widespread press
play. Roussos understood and agreed not to get involved.

He said Verbel! weuld prohahly cal? hin from Athens that
weekend and -he would give Werbell ‘a final negative reply.
Werbell planned to meet.with Greek Defense Minister
Averoff. Roussos said that.:if, the U.S. wanted to stop
tnis.deal that we should contact Averoff directly.

From what Werbell said, Roussos believes. the arms-
requested by the Greeks would ve for guerrillas and

not main force units.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA: | Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Mitchell Livingston Werbell [If

_y  . Mitchell Livingston Werbell III, who served briefly
- with the OSS in WHIT, has been engaged for the past several

years in arms: dealings and swash-buckling promutional

activities which have brought him to the attention of various
Prame agencies. He has always remained within the
law by~a’fine “edge. His latest scheme involves a. Movement
for the Independence of Abaco, an isiand to the East of the
Bahamas. For.this che has» obtained apparently substantial
financial support from wealthy Americans and from a British

Lord.

2. Werbell operates through a number of front businesses
in Washington, 0.C. and in Marietta, Georgia, where he owns
‘one outfit named Central Information Agency (CIA). In al
his dealings, Werbell broadly hints that he kas current iH
connections with the Agency. we have just learned that
Werbell may be in possession of a one-line note from you,
stemming from a chance meeting with you at an OSS alumni
dinner, reading something like “gocd to see you again.”

. 3. Three retired Agency employees are currently employed
by Werbell in various capacities. This past spring these
employees sought contact with tne Agency basically to report
their concern over the-legality o/ werbell‘s activities. We
quickly established that the matter was outside our charter
and asked these retirees to report directly to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.. We also furnished the Bureau with
all the pertinent information in ou: files. It is to be
noted that somewhere in Werbell's scheme of things there
appears the ubiquitous Andrew St. George, who plans to write
a story on Abaco for True magazine. .

was getting the ‘run around’ and replied, "just tell him
to talk to Jack Anderson" and hung up.

2. AC/WHO was briefed on the above telephone call at

In

view of C/WHD's previous decision that no further Agency
contact should be made with MULDOON, RUSSOS, or MACKEM jit
was decided that no one would return MULDOON's call. How-
ever, AC/WHD would brief AD00, on the above threat,

- and WH/7 would ask OPS/LIAISON to telephonically pass to the

According

cis apparently’ persona ‘non ‘grata in the Bahamas; hence his:
ambitions appéared to'-be contingent on Abacan’ independence.

Mr. Muldoon: reported that at least.on two occasions WER BELL ..
imadé.a conéerted effort .to involve "persons formerly affiliated
th the Agency in the activities of ‘the FOA in support of

its independence. On.several occasions, WER.BELi introduced

Mr: Nuldoon and-Mr.-Roussos as active Agency. officials, implying
“that either the. Agency.or the United -States Government supported
:the.aims of the FOA. WER BELL also proposed. to Messrs. Muldoon:

and Roussos. in separate conversations that they ‘conduct a study,

involving.a visit to “Abaco;-to determine the feasibility of-
‘‘Abaco’s independence in political and economic ‘terms. ~The

study was to include interviews with citizens of Abaco prior

to an aileged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in
‘Abaco on 28 June 1974. In default -of the collaboration of
. either..Muldoon or Roussos, WER BELL hired Mr. Walter Joseph

Macken,..a-forner.Agency:~ friend -of ‘both Muldoon and Roussos.
-According to WER BELL's file, Mackem later in 1974 contacted

the Agency in an attempt to get an official policy on the

activities of the FOA. Mackem was informed that the case

comes under FBI jurisdiction, that this Agency has no official
‘involvenent, and that all information we had on the matter had

becn nade available to the FBI. He was advised at that time
to report his. contacts and any information he had to the FBI.

7. On 24 March 1975, Mr. 1 assigned to
SE/PCH, reported that during the weck o larch 1975, he s

in the hington.area as a private investigator. He is also
involved with a paramilitary activity funded by some unnamed
British source. The activity, which Dycknan referred to as

who would participate in this adventure. Actording to Dycknan,
the paramilitary training supposedly was to take place
Georgia, where KER BELL, is sbased. . \ 7

on 31 August 1974, Mr. Roussos met with Mr.
who at that. time war AC/E/GC,.and told him that

“BELL was leaving-for Athens,.on 31 August to se11 arms to
Greek Government... “NER “BELL wanted Roussos to be‘ his

advisor in this. venture and to go to Athens. . Roussos told

WER BELL that -he would chec ith CIA before giving him an answer.

“+. WER BELL vasked Roussos ‘to the Agency, was in favor of

ce such.an arms deal ‘or not. strongly. advised st

: Roussos’ getting involved in this deal. - Roussos told

that he, understood andagreed not to get involved. Roussos.
gaid that WER BELL would probably ‘call him from Athens and he
would give WER BELL a final negative reply. ey

9.04.22 July 1974, the FBI reported: that WER: BELL may
be in possession of a one-iine note from former CIA Director ~
William Colby. stemming from a chance meeting with the Director
tan OSS alunni dinner, reading something Tike "Good to see
you again." -This note was apparently used by NER BELL to
suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor-
mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974. 7

10. According to reporting from several Stations, WER BELL
and Arthur L, Smith (a cohort of WER BELL's) were in several
Central American countries during ‘August and early. September... -.
1962. Their principal activity appeared to be contacting
officials of the governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
£1 Salvador for the purpose of obtaining recos ition of a
de facto Cuban Government in exile called the “United
Organization for the Liberation of Cuba." In discussions with
Nicaraguan Government representatives, WER BELL claimed the
proposed Cuban Governnent in exile had the support of 90
Separate Cuban exile organizations and 186,009 Cuban exiles.

SER BELL offered a.representative of the Nacaraguet Government
$100,000 to obtain that governnent's recognition of the Cuban
government in exile. The group clained to have its headquarters
at 1025 Connecticut: Avenue, XW, in shington,, D.C. While in
Guatemala, Smith claimed that the group had a man in the
Department of State in Washington, D.C., whom they pay $6,000

Memorandum for the Record

1.. Through the intermediary of DC/EA,
and: retired staffer Jack "Red" Stent, I was put in- touch
‘on 22 May 1974 with Johh MULDOON, another retired staffer
whois now noninal vice-president of a Washingtoy -based
firm called "Security Consultants International.” i
Be : . Muldoon made the contact with me apparently..on ‘the

beeen advice of Bob: Brown and Red Stent ‘whose’ counsel he
“", ‘sought. in-an ‘effort to protect himself from the possible
0 involvement with a group promoting:
the Bahamian Commonwealth—island- of -
“at 1100 hours at "Tony's" on L street.
and 18th N.W. in downtown Nashington, Red Stent- was
there to introduce me to Muldooa but he did not Participate
in the discussion.

2. Muldoon presented me with a typewritten report
containing the essential data he possessed concerning
a group of individuals with whom he had met on Friday,
17. May 1974 -in Washington. Attending the mecting with
‘ ‘i : Muldoon on that occasion were Mitchell! WERBELL III (aka

(inu) (the evening's object of Werbell's seomingly
voracious affections) and an employe of the Library of

a subsequent meeting on Monday, 26 May 1974, Muldoon
had lunch with WERBELL and free lance writer Andrew St.

information-we know that Abaco is.a small island at the
north end of the Bahamas archipelago a short distance
off the Florida coast, which was populated in 1785 by
British Loyalists and their Black.Slaves fleecing the
United“States following independence. The island remains
about'50% white. Openly apprehensive in. anticipation of

‘the Bahamas’ independence from Great Britain, the residents

‘of Abaco, both.white and black, have found themselves -
since :independence - the object of apparent antagonism

.and, adisinistrative neglect on the. part of the Pindling
“government,, which has fueled talk of secession from

Nassau rule. This talk has been institutionalized in an
genous organization headed by a white, Charles "Chuck"

HALb is a resident of Marsh Grove, the country cross roads
which péses as the metropolitan capital-of Abaco; he
frequently visits Miami where he meets with Werbell.

b.. Mitchell WERBELL III - A Phijadelphian,
WERBELL was a member of OSS in the Far East during World
War II where, according to Muldoon, he came to know the
Director and Lou Conein. Werbell currently a resident
of Atlanta, now is president of an international arms
peddling firm called Defense Systens International (DST).
in addition to industrial security systems, according to
MULDOON, DSI sells automatic weapons (including a ninia-
ture machine pistol with a silencer) and bomb-booby-trapped™
items of various sorts (e.g., a tennis ball with a fuse.
which is automatically activated when you stop playing)
and other Ja Rondian accessories. Werbell hopes to
establish ganing casinos, hotels and other tourist
facilities in Abaco catering to the U.S. tourist crowd
available for easy ferrying from nearby Miami. As a
consequence of some run-in with Prime. Minister Michael
Pindling, hoxever, Werbell is apparently’ permanently
persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his ambitions
appear to be contingent on Abacan independence.

c¢. Mike OLIVER - The financial angel of the
“Friends of Abaco," Oliver's origins and auspices are
somewhat obscure to Muldoon. OLIVER claims to have spent

time in a Nazi concentration camp during World War IL:
che speaks excellent French; he has a pet political
theory which he has published. He is seeking some
political entity where he can put his theory into
Practice to illustrate to the U.S. government that it
is worth practicing’ in this country. In contrast to
fhis colleague Mitch Three Werbell, however, he seems
adamantly opposed to establishing: a gambling empire.

““d. Lord and Lady BELLHAVEN - A member of
the British House of Lords, .RELLHAVED plans to’ make
a speech there, following his return to London. on 22
May 1974;-castigating the British government for
allowing Abaco to,be abused by Nassau. BELLHAVEN ”
appears to. be- identical with Robert Anthony Carmichael
. HAMILTON, bora 27:Feb 27,°the 13th Lord of BELHAVEN
and STENTON. - iis wife is the. former, Elizabeth Ann
MOSELEY, daughter. ofthe late Colonel ‘Arthur Henry:
“MOSELEY.” (whose claim .to fame remains. to be’ *probated)'.
‘This -inforriation. comes from sevéral tomes on. the
English. peerage which were researched ‘for me by Sally
Ann Brown of. £/BC

e: Howard HANDELMAN - The U.S. News and
World Report correspondent also has contacts with the
Agency, a fact which concerns Muldoon.

f. Central Investigation Agency - An Atlanta
detective Agency established a few vears ago by Howard
COSGROVE, a former Georgia police officer specialized
in narcotics operations who was apparently fired from
the force for reasons unknown to Muldoon. COSGROVE
retains a 26% interest in the CIA (sic); Mitchell _
WERBELL IV ("Mitch Four") holds another-26% and a re-
maining 6% interest is held by the nominal president of
"CIA," a retired Army colonel named Byer or Briar. The
"CIA" has in turn established Security Consultants Inter-
Rational, as a Washington-based wholly owned subsidiary.
SCI's specialities are anti-audio sweeps and electronic
surveillance using devices developed by one David NORISSEY,
an electronics engineer who collaborates with MULDOON &

“CIA.”

4. The incident which alarmed Muldoon occurred
during the Friday gathering of the individuals mentioned
in paragraph two. Muldoon palhed-off by Werbell at
this gathering as an “official of the CIA (Central



os SESHET ms

Intelligence Agency, in this instance)" vho was there
to attest to the fact that neither the CIA nor the U.S.
Government is. oppesed to Abacan independence. His
interlocutors, despite Muldoon's protests that he was
retired from.CIA and in no way represented U.S. government
interests respecting Abaco, seened anxious - he felt -

to accept his: presence there as evidence of U.S.

gover nt, cndorésement of the Abacan independence movement.

Muldoon took some pains to gain reassurance that
he ‘would not be pinpointed by Kerbell as ‘the source of
this information if any action were taken on it. I
assured. him that, apart’ fromthe particular incident on
17. May 1974, the general outlines of WERBELL and his
activities and.aspirations for Abaco have already been

. Feportéd by two-or three ‘other sources: . Since there is

Agency can plausibly do’ at this juncture
about WERBELL"S. apparent effort. to con ‘his supporters
intothinking that the CIA was backing the Abaco c
independence. venture, I told Muldoon. I Planned merely ~~
to-nake"his“side of ‘this story, a matter of record and

Tet it go at that. i HH i aie

6. _To.cap.off the story, Red Stent invited us to
lunch at, the Class Reunion on Eye Street ard 18th. When
Muldoon and I arrived to meet Stent we found him ensconced
at a corner table with three other people. Red rushed
over to inform us that he would be introducing me as a
colleague of his from AEROJET. He then presented me to

ERBELL, Werbell's date Patricia BOTOND and Cecil BRONNLOW
iation Weekly." WERBELL, looking for all the world
like Jerry Colonna, was intent on the task of seducing
Miss, BOTOND, who happened to be promoting a convention
for the Atlantic Union organization, a political enterprise
which is ‘an offshoot of the World Federalists Movement.
Miss BOTOND, as it turned out was reared in Shanvhai, China,
at the same time as Stent. Red had attended school with
her brothér.- the German School in Shanghai. Miss BOTOND
had been expelled from the German school in the late 1930s
for having had anti i doodles in her copybook.

Brownlow had helped Red obtain aerial photos of the

ChiCom consulate conpound in Geneva in the early 1960s
when Red was stationed in Paris. When Werbell had

wearied of the reminisences of Stent and Botond and had
managed to hustle prey off to a private table, Stent
revealed to BR at [ was not AERQJET but CIA.
Fortunately im} as mumbled at the introduction so that
No one could have repeated it. No one in fact seemed

interested.

7, Following lunch Muldoon left wit a culleague
for a necting at the Justice Department ‘to. determine :
whether in sweeping Enbassy buildings in Washington he
must register .as en agent of a foreign government
(whichever it aight be). Brownlow went about his
business. Stent paid for the lunch. I returned to :
what Stent whinsically refers to as the "Funny Farm.”
My only regret is that George Orwell could not have
joined us’ for that lunch. aie

, : , Interim Report - Pertod of
“42/3/73 = 12/9/73

RE: Current Bahamian Situation

At Miami, Florida—~—- -

suits of the Inquiry:
The. following people were contacted by the writer:

day Mallin (December.3, 1973.) Mallin states that to the

best of ‘his knowledge there are only two groups known to be active fn the
‘Abaco Movement--the group that Werbel (Mitchell Livingston WerBel III) fs
associated with and a group being headed up by a Bob Brown.

= o f: Brown’ is currently in Washington ana is about to return to his home
hich ts in Boulder, Colorado. Mallin {notcated that 1f anything were about
to occur Brown would certainly be in the Miami area.

Brown is a white American and an ex-Special Forces type. He has

formed & group of. ex-Special Forces Specialists that-in Mallin's opinion
"could really raise Hell.” Brom, according to Mallin, has been working for

‘Chuck Hall. However, Hall 1s alse aligned with WerBel.

t


Mallia states ¢ :-all of the planning sessfons r Srown's group

have been held in the iiving room of Mallin's Corat Gables home. :
Brown's group: {s all white but he has been in contact with some of

the loca? Blacks in Abaco. The Blacks have had no formal training nor do

they possess the proper. weapons for any sizable operation. In order to

\ obtain weapons and trainfng-the Blacks have made friencly overtures to Srown’s

\

‘group.

Mallin stated that sone of the local Blacks could move on thetr own

but he believes that it would be highly unlikely.
* hallin speculated. that U.S. Hafia money may be being spent in the

* Bahamas in Order to finance the overthrow of Pindling's government to stop

BAT the’ Seizure of the casinos. - He did not have any evidence to substantiate the

__. theory. oo : :
In answer to a=direct Quéstion from thé writer Mallin further commented

-that Paul Bethal is totally out of the Abaco situatfon. Bethal's only role,

according to Mallin, was the one meeting he arranged for WerBel, Hall, a Michael
Lightbourne (Phonetic) and George Wackenhut. Bethal, Mallin further stated, :

: ae , trys to give people the impress{on that he has very high level connections

including members of the National “Security Council.and.that .he prepares papers
-and other briefings for the Council. Mallin states that this {s not true, that
Bethal tn fact has na such contacts,

Mallin went on to say that WerBel would not get involved with anything
that would Jeopardize his U.S, government contracts especially the sale of
his silencer to the Amy. In addition, according to Mallin, Merde} tsa ciA
informant and would advise the Agency of his activities. On December 9, 1973,
