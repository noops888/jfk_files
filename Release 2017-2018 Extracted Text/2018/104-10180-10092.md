MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Charies Anderson
â€”_ SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

1. Mr. John Crimmins called Mr. Samuc] Halpern on
29 January and said that RAY is complicating the matter =
of the export permit for his guns by raising the issue
of traasshipment to Venezuela via the Dominican Republic.
The ultimate consignee must show on 211 arms export
licenses. It will appear strange indeed if a license is
issued which shows tbe Dominican Government acting as
intermediary for the Venezuelan Government, since there
are no relations between the two countries.

2, RAY should be apprised of this complication at
the first opportunity.
