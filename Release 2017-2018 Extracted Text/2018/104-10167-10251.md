VIA: SA/ADDG i ica
FROM: Raymond A. Warten i
i Chief. Latin America Division : t
SUBJECT: "Allegation by a Senior Cuban Diplomat / i
Concerning the Role of Cuban Exiles in. :
the Assassinaticn-of President Kennedy | # oa

REFERENCE: LA/CO/258-77 Dated 3 November 1977

1. Reference is sade to the referent memorandum which
reported a staterent made by a senior Cuban diplomat abroad Geeiee
alleging that “Cuban exiles such as DIAZ Lan (fnu) (sic) :
and ethers had ben involved in the assassination of :
President John F. Kennedy." We have received nothing

further to date to supplenent this information. ee t

2. DDO ‘records indicate that Pedro DIAZ Lanz, and
his brother Narces DIAZ Lanz, foraerly Chief and Deputy
Chief, respectively, of the Cuben Revolutionary Air Force,
entered the U.S. from-Cuba as exiles in mid-1959. Since
that time both DIAZ Lanz brothers reportedly ha been ~ ‘
closely associated with, and involved in numerous activities
with, Frank SIURGLS (aka FIORINI) of Watergate fame. A-
though the individual allegedly involved in the assassina-
tion of President Kennedy could be either of the DIAZ Lanz
brothers, it is noted that.the name Pedro DI Lanz had |
been cited in recent nexspaper items in this connection.!

We refer specifically to the New York Da ws article,
of 20 Septerber 1977 entitled ™ ays rove to! =
Dallas With Cswald & Kennedy ‘Assassin Squad',” a copy |
of which is attached. The Agency assisted in the evacuar
rs tion of Marcos from Cuba to Miami, and Fedro entered the
U.S. on his own. Althovgh both were debriefed by the
Agency, therc is no indication that they were ever con-
sidered Agency assets.
