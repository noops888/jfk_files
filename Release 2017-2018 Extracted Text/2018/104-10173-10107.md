aU. S. citizen,

and is married to a brench citizen named Marie Christine nee

#DAVIRON, born 23 October 1937 in France.

They reside at 10 Onslow Gardens,

"London, S. W. 7, and they have at least one child, Kevin Lloyd KORENGOLD, born

on 15 September 1968 in London, KORENGOLD is listed in Station records as head

of the Newsweck burcau in London and as a member of the Foreign Press Associa:

tion (to which a number of Soviet press and radio correspondents belong):.

Kenreth N; RACOLIN (p), who served with KORENGOLD in Moscow and who

Is still known to him as having been an LNYATE official there, has told us the follow-

a) KORENGOLD has twice been stationed in Moscow, first with UPI in

about 1961-62 and then with Nessweck in about 1963-65.

Between these two

assignments, he took a course in Russian studies at Harvard under a Nieman

Fellowship, He does, of course, speak Russian.

b) Having excellent contacts in Soviet intellectual circles; KORENGOLD

wa's one of the best sources of information for LNYATE and INCUFF press

persornel. in Moscow. On more than one occasion KORENGOLD ran into diffi-

culties with the Soviet authorities; he along with an LNCUFF officer were in the

apartment of the author AMAuRIk when it was raided.

Eastern and Western press circles in London.

after suitable cultivation, requests for assistance were made.

e) RACOLIN and his wife were personal friends of the KORENGOLD's,
