¢) KORENGOLD probably majatains agmmuel: contact os he caa with his
circle of Soviet acquaintances from his Moscow days, and since he is an ag-
gressive and well-informed man, he probably also is widely acquainted among
Eastern and Western press.circles in London,

d) In RACOLIN's opinion, KORENGOLD {could, cooperate ‘with JKLANCE if,
after suitable cultivation, requests for tissisuice-were-made.. ~~

e) RACOLIN and his wife were personal friends of the KORENGOLD's,
and on‘one’of:his TDYs to London, vit would be natural for RACOLIN tocontact
_ KORENGOLD; then of later RACOLIN could introduce ito him.
