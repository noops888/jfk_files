CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

DALLAS DIVISION

Re Bureau airtel to Albany, 5/7/62. 67-9-7J8

A review of captioned program in the Dallas Division

reflects that 39 interviews of notorious bookmakers, gamblers,

hoodlums, pimps, etc., have been conducted by the Dallas

Division

since the inception of this program in May of 1962.

As a result of this program, two potential criminal informants

have been developed, one being PHILLIP STEIN.

GEORGE FUQUA

developed as informant but through the efforts of the Kansas

City Division, who made contact with FUQUA while in custody

in Kansas.

WILLIAM HOWARD COOPER also designated as a PCI,

but continuous contacts were unproductive and the 137 matter

concerning COOPER has been closed.

From the above review it appears that the Dallas

Division has possibly reached the saturation point in this

program and it is recommended that this program be discontinued

by the Dallas Division.

It is noted that a companion type

program, namely the Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program,

is now in effect and through this six targets, who are considered

in the upper echelon of criminal activities in the Dallas area, L

have been designated for development as Top Echelon Criminal

Informants. It is the recommendation of Dallas that this

latter program receive the full attention of Agents assigned

to the Criminal Intelligence Matters in the Dallas Division

as it is believed this program will be more productive.

It is noted that persons designated as targets

for development as Top Echelon Criminal Informants are in

most cases identical with persons with whom interviews

are desired under the above-captioned, program.

It is believed

that more productive interviews

of per sons designated

targets can be

had,through the necessary background investiga-

tions that must be conducted in order

to develop a most

logical aper gach to

this person.
