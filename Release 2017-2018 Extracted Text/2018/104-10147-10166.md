MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Handling of Tapes of Nosenko's Testimony

held at CIA by someone

personally acceptable to him--

Vasia Gmirkin.

testimony had not been transcribed and that Nosenko

and Gmirkin were to be in an extended travel status.

approved by Nosenko to handle and protect these tapes.

The HSCA finally provided this week a court reporter

experienced in transcribing tapes. When it was learned

that Mr. 1

would be out of

town on Thursday and

Friday of this week and Monday of next week it was

realized by HSCA that the tapes would not be available

for use on

these days.

Mr. Blakey phoned on Tuesday

asking that arrangements be made.

2. I told Blakey that I was not in a position to

unilaterally modify the agreement that he and I had with

Nosenko. The testimony was recorded only because of the

special

personal arrangements that were acceptable to

Nosenko.

We had arranged for a substitute acceptable

to Nosenko, but untortunately he is going to be away for

three of the days that the Committee had hoped to work

I pointed out to Mr. Blakey that we

had been surprised at the delay in preparing the trans-

cript of the testimony, which was a contributing cause

to the present problem. Blakey then produced some horror

stories to build a case of our dereliction in this matter.

his notes, he was

"denied" access to the tapes. I told

Blakey that this was

very unlikely but that 1

could not

recall the story and

story as

"wild".

at that and replied that the witness was the one who

Nosenko and would not, but I would explore what we

Blakey asked me to get word back to the

HSCA chief clerk, Miss Elizabeth Berning.
