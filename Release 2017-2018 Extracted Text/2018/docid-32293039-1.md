My enclosed memorandum to you dated 4/28/61 reported

results of discussion on 4/27/61 between Liaison Representative

and Carl Wack, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) con-

cerning situation wherein Marcello, notorious New Orleans hoodlum,

is now trying to get back to U.S. from Guatemala where he was

deported 4/4/61 by INS on basis of Guatemalan birth record

subsequently revealed to be false.

No comment was made by Liaison

Representative when certiformant to this ma ser because kilby

went to Guatemala in 1956 with Carl Irvingwoll. (Noll has aamitted

being invorved In fabricating Marcello's birth record in 1950.)

Regarding Wack's suggestion kilby is our informant as za false

birth record Director asked "Is he? H."

Kilby is not Bureau informant in this matter Our

informant is Raymond Rolling, associate of Marcello and an

informant of New Orleans Division.

Only reference to Kilby in

Bureau files reflects that when we interviewed him on 5/29/58 he

told us he never associated with Noll; that he knew Noll made

trips to Guatemala; and that they talked about selling slot machines

there.

Kilby also said that when he knew Noll, he heard discussions

and rumors regarding acquisition of Guatemalan citizenship by

Marcello (62-302-33-4)
