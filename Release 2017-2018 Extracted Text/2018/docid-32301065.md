maintain constant oor J [yi Ods plane. When the
plane picks up the bombs to goon a raid against Cuba,
Customs then will seize the plane, all articles of war,
and the vehicles at the scene. Customs said no arrest
will be made, and all persons involved will be interviewed.

Miami Office feels MM 639-S will not be compromised
with the Cubans or Customs, and there is no danger for
the informant in participating, o)

Miami Office feels that the informant, in agreeing
to -fly the bombing mission, and being temporarily detained
by U. S. Customs, will solidify the informant's position
with BOSCH to the point of participating in future missions
and possibly gaining knowledge of BOSCH's extortion

activities. Y

This matter is being closely followed with the
informant and U.S. Customs, and the Bureau will be kept
advised.
