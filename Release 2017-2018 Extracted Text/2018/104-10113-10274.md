Chief, Allen Affairs Staff

SUBJECT:

LANZ, Pedro Diaz

* Reference is made to the attached memorandum dated

6 July 1959, from the Chief, Personnel Security Division,

pertaining to certain activity which occurred over the past

weekend concerning the subject's detention by the I&NS.

2. On this date Inquiry was made of Mr.

WH Division, with regara to this matter. He declared that

everyone on a working level in the Is was most cooperative

with the Agency with regard to the subject. He indicated,

however, that it appeared that General Swing was taking a

"hard nosed" approach in view of an interest in the subject

indicated he felt it would not be

desirable to attempt to have the subject released from detention

until General Swing decides that such action is propitious.

3.

On this same date inquiry was made of Mr. H. D. Nice,

I&NS, with regard to this matter.

He declared that there was

"nothing you or I could have done" to have precluded the

situation that arose over the past weekend.

He declared that

someone in this Agency had misinformed General Cabell to the •

effect that the Immigration Service was holding the subject

in detention and would not permit CIA representatives to talk

to him. The fact of the matter according to Mi. Nice, was that

secondly, It was a suggestion of the cla representative in Miami,

Bernard Reichardt, who had the opportunity to interview the

subject); and thirdly, because General Swing became aware of

the fact that several different components of the U.S. Government

were evidencing a primary interest in the subject.

It was made

clear to Mr. Nice that certainly General Cabell did not wilfully

attempt to deceive the Commissioner of Immigration and Natural-

Ization Service, and 1f in fact he did give the impression that

he belleved that the Service would not permit CIA to interview

the subject, such an impression was merely due to the fact

that he did not have complete information at his disposal.

4. Mr. L

- 02

mentioned above, Indicated this date that

complete coordination has been effected with the various

Government Agencies Interested in the subject, and now there

is a complete meeting of the minds with regard to the fact

that the CIA has primary interest in the subject for intelli-

mentioned that when Mr. Reichardt

contacted the Immigration people in Miami on Tuesday, 2 July

1959, the Immigration people were just about ready to release

subject from custody.

It was pointed out by Mr. Reichardt,

however, that to publicize the fact that the subject had been

afforded asylum in the U.S. could possibly have had disastrous

results with regard to our relationship with Cuba.

When this

fact was called to the attention of the Service, it was at that

point undoubtedly that General Swing was contacted, and he in

turn undoubtedly was in contact with the Internal Security Com-

a coatat with the

mittee, which resulted in his decision to revoke the parole of

IANZ and place him in detention for the time being.

5. This matter was effectively handled by the Chief,

Personnel Security Division, over the past weekend after

efforts to contact Messrs. Cotter and Pennington were unsuc-

cessful. Unfortunately, Mr. Massett, who was available at

home during the period in question, was not contacted. A

memorandum will be directed to the Physical Security Division

to assure that the identity of all professional members of this

Staff, along with their home phone numbers, are available to the

Night

Security Officer.
