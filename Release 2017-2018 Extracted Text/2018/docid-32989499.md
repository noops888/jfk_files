Senator Tower, What criteria do you use in the selection

of informants?

our cases relating to extremist matters, surely in order to get
an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged in a
criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set
of eriteria. If you're talking about our internal security
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist
principally of checks of PUP IRy SAE indices, our field
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating
in the same area, and in various established sources such as
local police departments. ,

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type
who has credibility, can be depended upon to be reliable, we
would interview the individual in order to make a determination
as to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI
in discharging its responsibilities in. that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we
would conduct a rather in depth investigation for. the purpose
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator. Tower. .How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between
the. use of informants. for law enforcement as opposed to
intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?

32989499 Page 7

Mr. Wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. In |

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best address
the use of informants on criminal matters since he is over

the operational division on that.

Mr. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the fact _

that a criminal informant in a law enforcement function, you
are trying to develop evidence which ‘will be admissible in
court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant
alone, your purpose could either be prosecution or it could be
just for purposes of pure intelligence.

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality
of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,
through ae of the informant, obtain evidence which could be
used independently of the testimony of the informant so that
he can continue operating as a criminal informant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to
function as provocateurs?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, they're not. We have strict regula-
tions against using informants as provocateurs. This gets
into that delicate area of entrapment which has been addressed

by the courts on many occasions and has been concluded by the

courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage :

in an activity, the government has the right to provide him the
opportunity. This does not mean, of course, that mistakes don'4

occur in this area, but we take whatever steps we can to

‘avoid this. Even the law has recognized that informants can

engage in criminal activity, and ‘the courts have held that,
especially the Supreme Court in the Newark County Case, that
the very difficulty of penetrating ‘an ongoing operation, that
an informant himself can engagé in criminal activity, but
beesuse there “is lacking this criminal intent to violate a
law, we stay eeey from that. Our regulatioris fall short of that.
If we have a’ situation where we felt that an informant
has to become involved in some activity in order to protect
or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United ~
States Attorney or to the Attorney General to Aan to make sure
we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our
informants. mea \

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do
instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that
they are informing on, do you not?

Mr. Adams. We did when we had the COINTELPRO programs,
which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is eet
one of the best’ examples of a situation where’ the'law'was-
in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used
much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little
Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending
in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law
enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the
troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

historical problems with the ‘Kian cohen along. We had
situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost
powerless to act, We-had local law enforcement officers in
"some areas participating in Klan violence.

The instances mentioned by Mr. Rowe, every one of those,
he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't
see what action was taken with that information, as he pointed
out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance. We
also knew that in certain instances the information, upon being
received, was not being acted eee We also disseminated
simultaneously through letterhead memoranda to the Department
of Justice the problem, and here, here we were, the FBI, in a
position where we had no authority in the absence of instructio:
from. the Department of Justice, to make an arrest. ;

Sections 241 and 242 don't cover it because you don't eve
evidence of a conspiracy, and it ultimately resulted in
a situation where the Department called in United States
Marshals who do havé authority similar to local law enforcement
officials.

So, historically, in those days, we were just as frus-

- trated as anyone else was, and when we got information. from
someone like Mr. Rowe, good information, reliable information,

and it was passed on to those who had the responsibility to

Congress recognized this, and-it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the civil rights
statute, which added punitive measures against an “individual
that didn't have to be a conspiracy. But this was a problem
that the whole country was grappling with: the President of
the United States, Attorney General. We were ina situation
where we had rank lawlessness taking place, as you know from

Veterans Against the War?

Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the
intent to halter political expression?

Mr. Adams. We had information on the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War that indicated that there were subversive
groups involved. They were going to North Vietnam and meeting
with the Communist forces. They were going to Paris, attending
meetings paid for and sponsored by the Communist Party, the
International Communist Party. We feel that we.had a very valid
basis to direct our attention to the VVAW.

; It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was
head of the Communist Party, USA, and the comments he made,

and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it
split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost
group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point
factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and: they closed|
those chapters because there was no longer any intent to follow
the national organization.

But we had a valid basis for investigating it, and we
“investigated chapters to determine if there was affiliation
and subservience to the national office.

Senator Hart of Michigan. this is what should require
us to rethink this whole business. :

Mr. Adams. Absolutely.

And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well
as the congressional input _ going to address themselves to.

Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked about a wide eoage
of groups which the Bureau can and has had informant penetratio.
and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's ‘definition
of when an extremist or security investigation:may be under-
taken refers to groups whose activity either involves Violation
of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation
of such law, and when such. an investigation is opened, then
informants may be used.

Another guideline says that domestic intelligence
investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations.
The agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation
relevant to 2 potential violation. Even now,-with an improved,
upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back
again in a world of possible violations or activities which
may result in illegal acts.

Does this mean that the Bureau should investigate all

groups organizing or participating in such a meeting because

 théy may. result in violence, disruption?.:-.

“Mr. Adams. No, sir.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Isn't that how you justify
spying on almost every aspect of the peace movement?

Mr. Adams. No, sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we ~
monitor demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored ‘by a group that we have an
investigative Raeavebe in, a valid investigative intérest in,
or where members of one of these groups are participating where’
there is a potential that they might change the peaceful
nature of the demonstration.

But this is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing on the
First Amendment rights of people, yet at the same time being
aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers in the
past than we’ do at the present time, But we have had periods
where the demonstrations have been rather severe, and the
courts have said that the FBI has‘a right, and indeed a duty,
to keep itself informed with respect os the possible commission
of crime. It is not obliged to wear blinders until it may be
too late for prevention.

And that's a good statement if applied in a clearcut

Mr. Adams. Well, not in 1975, compared to what 1969
was, The problem we had at the time was where we had an
informant who had reported that this group, this meeting was
going to take place and it was going to bethe Daily World,
which was the east coast communist newspaper that made comments
about it. They formed an organizational meeting. We took
a quick look at it. The case apparently was opened in May .28,
1969 and closed June 5 saying there was no problem with this
organization.

Now the problem we get into is if we take’a qui

from that informant information which I considered to be

significant.

The Buffalo chapter of the VWAW was the regional office .

Codie New York and northern New Jersey: It was one of the
five most active VVAW chapters’ in the country and ata
national conference, or at the regional conference, this
informant reported information back to us that an attendee

UE the conference announced that he had run guns into Cuba
prior to the Castro take-over. He himself said that he during
the Cuban crisis had been under 24 hour suveillance. There
was also discussion at the conference of subjugating the

VVAW to the revolutionary union. “There were some individuals
in the chapter or the regional conference who were not in

agreement with us, but Mr. Adams has addressed himself to the

. interest of the revolutionary union.

So all of the information that we had on the vvaw did
not come from that source but even that particular source did
give us information which we considered to be of some
significance in our appraisal’ of the need for continuing the
investigation of that particular chapter of the VVAW,

Senator Hart of Michigan. But does it give you the’
right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even
if it is a conference that might be taken over by the VVAW
when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we

seek to achieve unconditional amnesty? What threat?

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, my time has expired
but even this brief exchange, I think, indicates that if we
really want to control the dangers to our society of using
informants to gather domestic political intelligence, we have
to restrict, sharply domestic intelligence investigations, And
that gets us into what I would like to raise with you when

my turn comes around again, and that's the use of warrants,

obliging the Bureau to obtain a warrant before’a full-fledged

informant can be directed by the Bureau against a group or
individuals.

I know you have objections to that and I would like to
review that: with you.

Senator Mondale, pursue that question.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an
obligation to obtain a warrant before you turn ftoose a full-
fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run
into you ox you run into, or who walk in as information sources
the Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the

Committee. The Bureau argues that such a warrant requirement

| might be unconstitutional because it would violate the First

Amendment rights of FBI informants to communicate with their

| government.

Now that's a concern for First Amendméent rights ‘that

ought to - hearten all the civil libertarians.

But ig would that vary, why would a warrant requirement
raise a serious ‘constitutional question?

Mr. Adams. Well, “for one thing it's the practicability
of it or “thé” tinpacticabiiity: lof! getting a warrant which:
ordinarily involves probable’ cause ‘to® ‘show that a crime has
been or is about to be committed,

In the intelligence field we are not dealing necessarily
with an imminent criminal action. We're dealing with activitied |
such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have
discussed before, where they say publicly we're ‘not. to engage
in any violent activity today, but we guarantee you we still
subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time
is ripe, we're going to rise up and help overthrow the United
States,

Well, now, you can't show probable cause if they're about
to do it because they're telling you they're nok going to do it
and you know they're not going to do it at this particular
moment.

It's just’ the mixture somewhat of trying to mix ina
criminal procedure with an intelligence gathering function, and
we can't find any practical way of doing it. We have a particula
organization. We may have an informant that not only belongs
to the Communist Party, but belongs to several other organization:

and as part of his function he may be sent out by the Communist

Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.

Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much,

Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential
security informant and a security informant?

Mr. Wannall. I mentioned earlier, Senator Schweiker,

‘that in developing an informant we do a preliminary check on

him before talking with him and then we do a further in-depth
background check.

A potential security informant is someone who is under
consideration before he ‘is approved by’ headquarters for use as’

an informant, He is someone who is under current consideration.

that they had all the information they needed to clamp down
on the conspiracy and could arrest people at that point in time,
and yet no fatreste were made.

Why, Mr. Wannall, was this true?

Mr. Wannall. Well, I can answer that based oniy on ‘the
material that I have reviewed, Senator Schweiker. It- was not
a case handled in my division but I think I can answer your,
question.

There was, in fact, a representative of the Department
of Justice on the spot counselling and advising continuously t
as that case progressed as to what spoint the, arrest should be
made and we were being guided by ‘those to our mentors, the
ones who are responsible for making decisions of that sort..

So I. think that Mr. Hardy's statement to the effect that
there was someone in the Department there is perfectly true.

Senator Schweiker. That responsibility rests with wlio
under your procedures?

Mr. Wannall. We investigate decisions on making arrests,
when they should be made, and decisions with regard to
prosecutions are made either by the united States attorneys
lor by Federals in the Department. ,

Mr. Adams. At this time that particular case did have

put it a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released
figures that we had ‘something like 2,000 informers of some
kina or another infiltrating the’ Klan out of roughly 10,000
estimated membership.

I believe these are either FBI figures or estimates.
That would mean that one out of every five members of the Klan
at that point was an informant paid by the government.

And I believe the figure goes era indicate that 70
percent of the new members of ‘the eine year were FBI

bombings of the church ‘in Birmingham. . We were faded with one
_tremendous probien at that time. : , et

Senator Schweiker. I acknowledge that.

Mr. Adams. our only approach was through informants
and through: the use of informants we solved these cases, the
ones that were solved. Some of the bombing cases we have
never solved. They Se Foran difficult, ©

These informants, as. we told the Attorney General, and
as we told the President, that we had moved informants like
Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the bodyguard to the

head man. He was in a position where he could forewarn us

of violence, could help us on casés that had transpired, and
yet we knew and conceived that ‘this could continue forever
unless we can create enough disruption that these ‘members will
realize that if I go out and murder three civil rights workers,
even though the sheriff and other law enforcement officers are
in on it, if that were the case and with some of them it was
the case, that I would be caught. And that's what we did and
that's why violence stopped, was because the Klan was insecure -
and just like you say, 20 percent, they thought 50 percent of
their tembers ultimately wee Klan members and they didn't

dare engage in these acts of violence because they knew they

couldn't control the conspiracy any longer, ‘

Senator Schweiker. My time is expired. I just have
— quick question,.

Is it correct that in 1971 we're using around 6500
informers for black ghetto situations?

Mr. Adams, I'm not sure if that's the year. We did
‘have one year where we had a number like that which probably
had been around 6000, and that was the time when the cities
were being burned, Detroit, ‘Washington, areas like this.- We,
were given a mandate to know what the situation is, where is”
violence going to break out, what next?

They weren't informants like an individual penetrating
an organization. They were listening posts in the community
that would help tell us that we have a trout here that's gettin
ready to start another fire-fight or something.

Senator Tower. At this point, there are ‘three more
Senators remaining for questioning. If we can try to get
everything in-in the first round, we will not have a ‘second
round and I think we can finish around 1:00, and we can. go
on al eeona alle the proceedings.

However, If anyone feels that they have another question
that they want to return to, we can come back here by 2:00.

Senator Mondale? .

record is now fairly clear that when the FBI operates in the

‘last’ month ox two, through its public disclosures, heaped
shame upon itself and really led toward an undermining of
the crucial public confidence in’ an essential: law. enforcement
agency of this country.

In a real sense, history has repeated itself because te
was precisely that problem that led to the creation of the FBI.

In World War I, the Bureau of Investigation. strayed from

its law enforcement functions and became an arbiter and

protector of political ideas. And through the interference
of civil liberties and Palmer Raids and the rest, the public
became so a that later through Mr. sabtiee Stone and:
Mr. Hoover, the eee el ereated, And the first statement

by Mr. Stone was that never again will this Justice Department
get involved in political ideas.

And yet here we are again looking at a record where with
Martin Luther King, with anti-war resistors, with -- we even
had testimony this morning of meetings with the Council of
Churches. Secretly we: are investigating this vague, ill-defined,
impossible to define idea of investigating dangerous ideas.

tools of law enforcement to protect people from subversive

at odds with the philosophy of American government.

I started in politics years ago and the first thing we
had to do was to “get the communists out of our parts and out.
ef the union. We did a very fine job. As far as I know, and
I'm beginning to wonder, but as fax as I know, we had no help
from the FBI or the CIA, We just rammed them out of the meetings
or the grounds that they weren't Democrats and they weren't ;
good union leaders when .we didn't want anything to do with them

And yet, we see time and time again that we're going .to

protect the blacks from Martin Luther King because he's
dangerous, that we've going to protect veterans from whatever
it is, and we're going to protect the Council of Churches

from the vetexans, and so on, and it just gets so gummy ‘and

confused and ill-defined and dangerous, that don't you agree
with me that we have to control this, to restrain it, so that
precisely what is expected of the yor is known by you, by the
public, and that you can justify your actions when we ask
you?

Mr. Adams. I agree with that, Senator, and I would like ;
to point out that when the REECHHEy General made his statement

Mr. Hoover subscribes to it, we follsed that policy for about

ten years until the President of the ited States said that

we should investigate the Wazi Party.

Senator Huddleston. Well, Mr. Rowe's statement is
substantiated to some extent with the acknowledgement by the
agent in charge that if you're going to be a Klansman and you
happen to be with someone and they decide to.do something, that
he couldn't be an angel. These were the words of the agent,.

Senator Huddleston. I wanted to ask how the selection of
information about an individual's personal life,.social, sex
life and -becoming involved in that sex life or social life
is a requirement for law enforcement or crime prevention.

Mr. Adams. Our agent handlers have advised us on Mr.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Senator Tower. Senator Mathias.

“Senator Mathias. ‘Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to come back very briefly to the Fourth
Amendment considerations in connection with the use of informants
and in posing these questions we're not thinking of the one
time volunteer who walks in to an FBI office and says I have
a story I want to tell you and that's the only time that you
may see him. I'm thinking of the kind of situations in which

there is a more extended relationship which could be of varying

will have some usefulness in a number of situations. But when
the FBI orders a regular agent to engage in a search, the first
‘ aor

test is a judicial warrant, and what I would like’ to explore
with you is the difference between a one time search which
requires a warrant, and which you get when you make that
search, and a continuous search which uses an informant, or
the case of a continuous search which uses a regular undercover:
agent, someone who is totally under your control, and is ina
slightly different category than an informant.

Mr. Adams.— Well, we get there into the fact that the

Supreme Court has still held that the use of informants does’

not invade any of these constitutionally protected areas, and

if a person wants to tell an informant, something that isn't
protected by the Supreme Court.

An actual search for legal evidence, that is a protected
item, but information and the use of informants have been
consistently held as not posing any constitutional problems.

Senator Mathias. I would agree, if you're talking about
the fellow who walks in off the street, as I said earlier,
but is it true that under existing pebeaualen informants are
given background checks? ' |

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. And they are subject to a testing period

Mr. Adams. That's right, to verify and make sure they
are providing to us reliable ‘information. 7

Senator Mathias. And during the period that the relation-
ship continues, ‘they are rather closely controlled by the

“Mr. Adams, That's true.

Senator Mathias. So in effect they can come in a very
practical way agents themselves to the FBI.:-

Senator Mathias. Certainly agents in the common law use
of the word.

glean all the information that he wants, and that’ is not in the.
Constitution as a protected area. But we do have this problem.

Senator Mathias. But if a regular agent who is a inember ,
of the FBI attempted to enter ‘these premises, he would require
a warrant?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, if a regular -- it depends on the
purpose for which he is entering. If a regular agent by
concealing his identity, by ‘-- was admitted as-.a member of the
Communist Party, he can attend Communist Party meetings, and he
can enter the premises, he can enter the building, and there's”
no constitutionally invaded area there.

Senator Mathias. And so you feel that anyone who has
a less formal relationship with the Bureau than .a.regular

agent, who can undertake a continuous surveillance operation

as an undercover .agent.or as an informant. ~~
“Mr. Adams. As long as he commits no illegal acts.
Senator Mathias. Let me ask you.why you. feel that it is

degree of formal action required?

Mr, Adams. The main difficulty is the particularity
which has to be shown in obtaining a search warrant. You
have, to go after particular ‘evidence. You have to specify
what you're going after, and an informant operates in an
area that you just cannot specify. He doesn't know what's
going, to be discussed at ‘that meeting. .It may be a plot to
blow up the Capitol saat or it may be a plot to blow up the
State Department building. . ;

Senator Mathias, If it were a criminal investigation,
you would have little difficulty with probable cause, wouldn't
you? ,

Mr. Adams. We would have difficulty in a warrant to
use someone as.an informant in that area because the same
difficulty of particularity exists. We can't specify.

Senator Mathias. I understand the problem because it's
very similar to ihe that we discussed earlier in connection
say wiretaps on a national security problem.

Mr. Adams. That's it, and there we face the problem of
where the Soviet, an individual identifica as a Soviet spy
in a friendly country and they tell us he's been a Soviet spy
there and now he's coming to the United States, and if a can't
show under a probable cause warrant, if we couldn't show that
he was actually engaging in espionage in the United States,
we couldn't get a wiretap under the probable cause requirements

which have been discussed, If the good fairy didn't drop the

why we're still groping with it.

Senator Mathias. When you say fall short, you really,
you would be. falling short of the requirements of the Fourth
Amendment.

nation and make sure that it survives first, first of all
national survival, and these are the areas that not only the
President but the Attorney General are concerned in and we're
all hoping that somehow we can reach a legislative middle
ground in here.

Senator Mathias. Which we discussed in the other national
security area as to curtailling a warrant to that particular
need.

Mr. Adams. And if you could get away from probable

cause and get some degree of reasonable cause and get some

‘method of sealing indefinitely your interest, say, in an

ongoing espionage case and can work out those aifticiities,
we may get their yet.

Senator Mathias. And you don't despair of finding that

Senator Mathias. And you believe that the Department,

General is personally interested in that also.

Mr. Adams. I think that that would be a much greater
difficulty in an area of domestic intelligence informant who
reports on many different operations and different types of

activities that might come up rather than say in a Soviet
espionage or,a foreign espionage case where you do have a littl
more degree of specificity to deal with.

together and try out some drafts with each other, but in the
meantime, of course, there's another alternative and that

major abuses of Congress and get over this hurdle, I think

we're still going to have to recognize that heads of agencies
have to accept the responsibility for managing that agency
and we can't just keep pushing every operational problem up
to the top because there just aren't enough hours in the’ day.

Senator Mathias. But the reason that parallel suggests |
itself is of course the fact that the wiretap deals generally :
with one level of information in one sense of gathering
information. : You hear what you hear from the tap.

Mr’, Adams, But you're dealing in a much smaller number
also.

Senator Mathias. Smaller number, but that's .all .the
more reason. When -an informant goes in, he has all of his
senses, He's gathering all of the information a human being
can acquire from a situation and has access to more information
than the average wiretap.

And it would seem to me that for that reason a .parallel
process might be useful ‘and in order.

Mr. Adams. Mr. Mintz pointed out one other main
distinction . to me which I had over looked’ from our prior
discussions, which is the fact that with an informant he is
more inthe position of being a concentral monitor in that one
of the two parties to the conversation agrees, such as like
concentral monitoring of telephones and microphones and

anything else versus the wiretap itself where the individual

If I'm the third party overhearing a conversation that is taking
place in a room where I am, and my true character isn't perceive
by the’ two people who are talking, an effect they haven't :
consented to my overhearing my conversation. Then they consent
if they believe that I am their friend or their, a partisan
of theirs . : :
But if they knew in fact that I was an informant for

someone else, they wouldn't be consenting.

Mr. Adams. Well, that's like I believe Senator, Hart
raised earlier, that the courts thus far have made this

distinction with no difficulty, but that doesn't mean that

_ there may not be some legislative compromise which might be

addressed,

Senator Mathias. Well, I particularly appreciate your
attitude ‘in being willing to work on these problems because
I think that's the most important thing that can evolve from
these hearings, so that we can actually look at the Fourth
Amendment as the standard that we-have ts achieve. But the
way we get there is obviously going to i “a lot easier if we

deals with whether we shouldn't impose a standard of probable

cause that a crime has been committed as a means of controlling

_ the use of informants and the kind of information that they

collect.

Do you feel that‘this would be too restrictive?

Mr. Adams, Yes, sir, I do.

When I look at informants and I see that each year
informants provide us, locate 5000 dangerous fugitives, they
provide subjects in 2000 more cases, they ee $86 million
in stolen property and contraband, and that's irrespective
of what we give the. lecal law enforcement and other Federal
agencies, which is almost a comparable figure, we have almost

reached a point in the criminal law where we don't have much

left. And in the intelligence field we still, I think when

we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure
that we have the means to gather information which will permit
us to be aware of the daentity of individuals and organizations
that are acting to overthrow the government of. the United
States. And I think we still have some areas to look hard

at as we have discussed, but I think informants are here to.
stay. They are absolutely essential to law enforcement.
Everyone uses informants. The press has informants, Congress
has informants, you have individuals in Sour community that
you rely on, not for ulterior purposes, but to let you know i
what's the fecl of the people, am I serving them properly,

Tarver also noted that
McGill attended the bangvet
for King, an act the publisher
regarded as wholly inconsist-
ent with the tone and content
of the FBI memo and letter.

At the time of the King
banquet, Tarver was president
of Atlanta Newspapers. 7

Mills B. Lane Jit, former
chief of the C & S bank, said:
“Ralph McGill always thought

“There is ho shred of evi-

said. “When it (the dinner)

not including McGill) met in

have it to honor him (Hing)
even if we just had box

lunches,
“Tt was a big success. We

{ sold out of lickets two weeks

before the banquet. People .
wanted tickets who couldn’t
get them.” .

Miss Bullard, who operates
a public relations firm in
Atlanta, checked her files of
the banquet, which was held
Jan, 27, 1965, and said there
was “no mention anywhere”
of any reluctance"by McGill
to continue sponsoring the
event.

‘The FBI's campaign against
King, which aimed at collect-
ing information that could be
used to neutralize him as a
civil rights, leader, went on
from late 1963 until King’s
“assassination in 1968.

‘The Senate committee did
not investigate the assassina-
tion. Nor did the committee
listen to tapes made through
“bugs” in King’s hotel rooms,
or read transcripts of those
tapes. Staff members said to
do so would compound the
invasion of the civil rights
leader's privacy, adding that
the purpose of the recordings

apes. 7 7
| The -diserediting campaign
Involved the use of friendly
iews people to plant un-

efforts, sometimes successf 1,
. to block contributions: to te
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC); efforts to
block meetings between King
and world leaders or to dis-
courae various organizations:
from honoring him; and the

bugging of his hotel rooms -
with attempts to distribute :

publicly the tapes derived !

from the bugs.

‘The FBI mailed King one of
those tapes, along with a let-
ter that aides said King inter-
preted as an invitation fo
commit suicide. The tape was
originally to have gone to
Coretta Scott King, his wife,
with the aim of promoting a
separation between the two,

but- was mailed to King im-

stead. o.

Even after his death, the
- FBI continued to plan against
King. The Allanta field office
sent a recommendation to
Washington in 1969 for a pro-
posed program to be used “in

- clined to entertain counterin-
telligence action against
Coretta Scott Kings and-or the
continuous projection of the

ther King.” Hoover replied
that the bureau “does not de-

Using the Sen-

findings, let us
observe a trio of

Qularmeys FSR #
eneral at their individ aa
General at their inivideal mom

_1. Nicholas Katzehbach and the by,
ging of hotel rooms of Martin Luther
King. The unlawful harassment of Dr
King was the worst abuse of federal
power against an individual in ov.
history; Atty. Gen, Katzenbach knew
about it, was warned about it, had tv
power to stop it — but looked th
ther way. a

| It was Ben Bradlee, then head «:
Newsweek's Washington Bureau, wi. +
ii — to his credit — alerted Katzenbacit
to the way FBI officials were pec-
dling salacious King tapes to newsmen
in 1964. In his moment of truth, the
Atty. Gen. response was “clearly
inadequate,” concludes the committee.

Hal Gulliver's column will resume
shortly.

In fact, he permitted the official wire-
tapping of Dr. King to go on for four
months after receiving the warning of
a smear campaign using unofficial
“pugs.”

When Katzenbach’s complicity in
the bugging of Dr. King was first sug-
gested in this space a year ago, he ex-
ploded with a letter using all the libel

the placement of microphones ‘in Dr..
| King’s suites. Three FBI memos say-\

‘initials, and there was a handwritten
note from him — dated and filed in'
sequence with a bugging notification
— telling Director Hoover “Obviously
these are particularly delicate surveil-
‘lances and we should be very cau-
tious... .” fe
Katzenbach’s reaction to this evi-
dence was to insist he couldn't
remember what his note was refer- _
ring to — maybe it was some other
surveillance that day. Nor could he
remember initialing any of the bug-
ging notifications, but — under oath
— he added artfully: “If they are my
initials and if I put them on, then
am clearly mistaken sn ri
‘The Church committee report on
Dr. King (written with admirable’
evenhandedness by Old Kennedy Hand
Michael Epstein) permits the clear
conclusion that (a) the wiretapping of
« Dr.: King was originally Rober!
. Kennedy’s idea, not J. Edgar Hoow»
er’s, and. (b) the systematic ft

of snoop and smear could probably,
not have taken place without th
sometime tacit, sometimes explicit +
toleration of Nicholas Katzenbach.

2, Ramsey Clark and the Doar Plan
to spy on dissidents. Under heat from
the Johnson White House to crack
down on black power groups and New
Left peaceniks, Atty. Gen, Clark told
his henchman, John Doar, to come up
with a plan to bring the full power of
government to bare on gathering
intelligence about dissenters.

The Doar Plan — forming the
“{nterdivision information unit,” de-
scribed last ‘year in this column —
was submitted, urging that agencies
as disparate as the Narcotics Bureau,
the poverty program, the IRS and the
Post Office Department he tapped to”
“funnel information” into a computer
that a later Clark study said would
create a “master index on individuals,
or organizations.”

Clark, in that moment of truth in
1967, approved the Doar Plan, spawn-
ing the infamous IDIU, which — in,
sthe Church committee’s words —was
the focal point of a massive domestic
intelligence apparatus . . . resulting

\IRS Gave FBI ‘Names of
SCLC Contributors,

Secret

n By CLAUDIA TOWNSEND q
t ‘Consituion Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON — When the FBI
fas looking for ways to undermine th
civil rights work of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr., the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) helped out by revealing the names
of people who had contributed secretly
to King’s Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC), according to a Sen-
ate staff report released Tuesday.
The IRS had the names because the
SCLC is a tax-exempt organization re-
quired by Jaw to file a list of its contrib
utors. But the list is a confidential one,
so that persons may contribute to SCLC
or similar organizations without making
their support public, Hf
Giving the FBI access to the names
of donors to SCLC and other organiza-
tions “has threateved hoth the integrit{r

(f the tax system and the constitutional
Hights of the contributors,” the boon
Intelligence Committee staff’ repor
charges.

“The identity of members of organ-
izations such as the SCLC is privileged
_ to protect members in their right to
freedom of association,”. the committee
staffers wrote.

\ ‘The ‘FBI's plans to use the list of
names in efforts to disrupt SCLC “con-
stitute a direct attack on the very inter-
est which the right to anonymity pro-
tects,” according to the reporf. The
| bureau's plans were “a purpose for
which the FBI could not have obtained a
list of SCLC -contributor: from any

jourt.” .
{ According to the Intelligence Com?
thittee, the FBI obtained from the IRS
“all available information” about both,

q King and the SCLC in 1964. On April i,
»1964, the Atlanta field office suggested
in a memo to FBI headquarters i;
Washington that the SCLC donor list bi
‘used in a plan to disrupt future contribu-
tions to the organization. man
_ What the FBI should do, the Atlanta
office suggested, was to forge letters
from King to each of the donors, warn-
ing the donors that the IRS was investi-
gating SCLC’s tax records and’ reassur-
ing each one that his contribution was
properly reported according to tax law
requirements.  - :
“It is believed such a letter of this
type from SCLC (to the donors) may
cause considerable concern and elimi-
nate future contributions,” the FBI
memo stated. at
& PRI officials in Washington rejected?
the suggestion as “not appearing desiras

“ble and-or teasible for direct action by
“the bureau this time.”

However, the committee report -

states, the fact that the FBI didn’t go
through with the plan “does not affect
the basie point that FBI headquarters
furnished the tax information, including
the list of contributors, to the local of+
fice in order to enable the local office to
devise disruptive action.”

The report says FBI policy as
applied in other similar cases “makes it
clear that the suggestion was not re-
jected because of concern for the legal-
ity of using the contributor list” for the
purpose of disrupting the organization.

Committee research into the FBI

activities has turned up other instances’

‘in which the FBI attempted to use finan-
cial information to discredit King or
hamper his activities,

The bureau in 1964 reviewed five *
lyears’ worth of tax returns for King. the
JSCLS, and the Gandhi Society (a group
‘that the FBI said “augmented” SCLC’s,
fundraising activities).

FBI agents also obtained a promise
from IRS to scrutinize King’s then-cur-
rent\ returns “very carefully to deter- -
mine whether any violations appear.”

Tn 1965, the FBI launched an inves-
tigation aimed at proving that King held
large amounts of money in a-numbered
Swiss bank account. That plan was con-
ceived during a golf game, when an
acquaintance of the FBI supervisor of
the King case mentioned that he’d heard

December, 1965, that investigation was

“described by Hoover as “the most f

Shortly after that, however, the
investigation was dropped when the ,
original source of the rumor told the
FBI that the existence of the bank ac-
count “was merely a wild conclusion”

Fifth District Rep. Andrew Young
told the committee that contributions to
SCLC were “chilled” by the FBI’s alle-
gations about the bank account.

“There were direct attempts at

us that they had been told by agents that

For 25 years or more, US}
intelligence agencies opened’
and read Americans’ mail.

‘tampered with oversea’
cables, and spied on thousands
of private citizens while their
leaders condoned violating the
Constitution, a former White
House staffer said here,

“These were not ‘minor
aberrations’ as some would
like us to believe. Intelligence
agencies, acting sometimes as
an arm of the president,
sometimes on their own,
carried out systematic pro;
grams which their leaders
knew were illegal,” said Dr,
Morton Halperin, one-time
senior staff member of the

is National Security Council.

| Halperin told an American ‘

i, Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
audience Tuesday night that
intelligence “reforms” recom-
mended by President Ford
will allow the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, FBI, and mili-
tary spy services to continue
abusing the law under a cloak
of legality;

Even the Russians were so
confident of American consti-
tutional guarantees that they
occasionally used the U.S.£
smail to send information to:
agents in this country, Halp-*
erin said. t

" “They used it in the crazy
belief that Americans would .
not open up their citizen’s
mail,” he said.

He said CIA officials first
asked postal officials for per-
mission to copy addresses on.,

” Over the past 15 months, con-
gressional investigations and
* journalistic exposes have uncov-
ered benumbing evidence of
gross malfeasance on the part of
‘the Internal Revenue Service
QRS), The Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Many Americans have tradi-

“tionally mistrusted the IRS and °

the CIA. They had doubts about
the IRS because of the complex-
ity of its tax forms and an al-
most paranoid anticipation of a
‘tax audit. The coat-and-dagger,
super-secret, nature of the CIA
engendered anxiety. It was a
simple case of fear of the un-
known.

On the other hand, the FBI
was the most respected and
trusted law enforcement agency
in the land. The late J. Edgar
Hoover and TV’s Inspector Ir-
_ Skin were the country’s two best
known cops.

A survey conducted early in

| 1974 indicated that more than 85
per cent of those polled had
complete faith in the integrity.of

_ (Mount Clipping in Space Balnwt

Refurbished EBL

the FBI. .A_ similar survey Te-
cently showed that fewer than
40 per cent still kept the faith.

Out of the investigations and”

charges, important overdue
changes in the FBI are beginning
to emerge. Internal changes are
being made by Director Clarence
Kelly and his overseer, Attorney
General Edward H. Levi. Con-
gress will impose curbs on FBI
powers and modus operandi.

The new rules of the game de-
fine the FBI’s powers to carry
out domestic intelligence opera-
tions. Provision is made for close
congressional and Justice Depart-
inent oversight of FBI opera-
tions. There will be restrictions
on the collection, filing and. dis-
semination of information that
might be damaging to individu-
als.

Most importantly, a fixed ten-
ure for the director will prevent
anyone in the future from build-
“ing up such awésome power as

that acquired by the late J _Ed-

gar Hoover. .
Thank Providence! It appe

that we acted in time.

“ ‘The ‘fact ‘is'that McGilt' was the only
white business or professional leader: in
Atlanta who stepped forward to co-sponsor
the banquet, in conjunction with a Catholic
bishop and a Jewish rabbi, while the bank:
ers atid businessmen of that’ city ran for,

‘* alternately raged and laughed at the specta-
cle of Atlanta’s white establishment being
too timid or- too segregated to even send

ing a black Nobel Prize winner.- .
.« .. While Hoover enjoyed Sullivan-inspired
visions of the great liberal newspaper pub-

jisher warning an eager business establish-. |
* ment away from the King banquet, I |
watched McGill work his way around the :

{ boycotting. businessmen to the holders of
»wreal power in. Atlanta, whom he persuaded

-on the. bankers to-support the King banquet.
*, At a very late hour the banquet was saved
“* from being a lonely gathering of black peo-
+ ‘ple and a few white humanists by an inpour-

: ing of ‘second. vice-presidents, and even
‘ some firsts, because the word had been

passed from on high as a result of McGill's

- single-handed exertions.

I had thought the finest irony of that :

, banquet was the praise Time magazine later
davis on Aflanta because the white estab-

‘lishment had honored a black son, the kind |

of national: publicity that brought a boom to
. that once s.zepy town.

But riow the Senate investigating staff "

» has disclosed the true irony: Hoover thought.
+ McGill was trying to sabotage the banquet,
because his agents had told him so.
‘The implication speaks for itself. An
autocratic ‘BI ‘director, armed with the
Seah 's trust and secure from a cowed Con-

. Second vice presidents to the banquet honor- _

~gress, could misuse his power to stalk and,”

* smear any American citizen of his choosing
including you or me. And probably because

she wanted only good news, he got demon- ,

~ strably false intelligence ‘upon which to ‘base
* his whims, Frightening?

Consider the footnote: The “agent who i

. failed to persuade me to smear Dr. King in

The Atlanta Constitution got a harsh Hoover’:

letter and an overnight transfer to a distant

city not long after he failed to come up with

if clippings that would have pleased Hoover: I
saw the letter. It said the agent was being
punished for being six pounds overweight. *

However, it is regrettable that he failed {b-
mention the three prime movers of the
Atlanta civic banquet honoring the late

the Nobel Peace Prize. Coca-Cola’s Robert
Woodruff was a late and reluctant starter.

Banquet were former Mayor Ivan Allen, the
‘late Archbishop Paul J. Hallinan, and the *

Several weeks before the banquet, as
editor of The Georgia Bulletin, I was visited
by. a bureau agent concerning alleged extra-

* marital sexual activities by Dr. King. I was.
urged not to let the Archdiocesan newspaper
be party to the sponsoring of the banquet.
One quote of the FBI agent stood out:

.. “The Church should be very careful
about honoring such a man, for you will
only regret it when all the facts come out,”

I told the agent that he would have to
come up‘with more than an innuendo, and |
 .tefused to drop the sponsorship. :
Several days later, the agent visitéd the
Archbishop, who was seriously ill in St. Jo-
Seph’s Hospital. I saw the Archbishop after

« the visit, and he was very upset at the FBI
tactics. He told me he had refused the’ FBI
suggestion that he back out as a prime spon-
sor of the banquet: And to show his support
for Dr. King, he left his’: ‘sick bed to attend
the banquet.
