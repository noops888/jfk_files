Operstions Against Cubs

idasaenasemnciisll

i 2. Action: This memorandua is for your informetion

°° sad pursuant to your request, Recommendations for ection rra
contained ia Paragraph V below, The purpose of this memerro ss)
ia to colinente an operations} ping for the retion which ar
believe should be taken by CIA ogsinst Cuba fur the predictahts
future, In‘susmary the plan provides for cratinuing, even
intensifying, the intelligence effort egeinst Cubs and fcr
. the reortentstion of the current effort into » long tern

denied srea type of operation of the highest pricrity.

I, ASSUMPTIONS:

A. The United States Government will ylve public
angurances that, provided no nuclesr or offeusive weapers 227
present or re-introduced into Cubs, end provided Cubr deer

-~ not trke section to threaten the peace ond security of tre
Western Hesisphere, the United States dces not ingend te



B, These assurances will preclude eny meaningful CIA
action ‘on a phesed basis to provoke a revolt inside cub, since
unless there are major changes in operational: and internal con-
ditions in Cuba, such a-revolt if provoked would be totally
destroyed: by Cuben counteraction io a.matter of hours or, at

day' cenless sepported by. = major, United States
In ‘aaditiod,” the non~invasion. assurances

ay practical matter will. preclude dnvading Cuba on the pretext

‘of a contrived provocation such as an attack on Guantanamo.

i c. cm operations: involving. a high noise level and.
dintiact elenent of. ttributability, particularly paramilitary,
* guerrilly, and couiaando type operations will be unacceptable
as a matter of policy.

D.° The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for

ithe indefinite future with its security and control apparatus

, relatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing
unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

* conditions in Cuba increasingly difficult. While it is

possible that recent and future developments including the
Soviet action in removing the offensive wespons from Cube mry
serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there is as yet no hard
indication that the control of the Castro-communist regime over

. Cuba bas been substantially weakenod.

». B,. The United stat
support of: an invasion will, in effect, constitute giving tc

assurances of no invasion and no

Castro and his regime a certain degree of ssnctuary. This will



Beverely domage the morale and motivation of anti-regine Cubene
both inside sad outside of Cuba, which will rake 1¢ incressingly
difficult for us to. recruit agents, maintain agents already

recruited, and. continue or intensify our intelligence and other

efforts ‘Sgainst Cuba and the Castro~communist regime,

szainat ‘cuba ‘ena may even continue to contend that the ultinate-
objective is the overthrow of the Castro-communist regine.

— This. ced an unrealistic objective, however, except.on a very

dong-tera bagis as the: United States Government, we believe,
will be unwilling an the. inmediate future to commit troops

7 to support such an overthrow. The United States Government

ia its overt dealings with the Cuban exiles probably will not
‘express, the above factors to them in hood context or with the
bluntness: stated here.
G. In view of these factors, the sd-called “Track Tio",
- course of action, 1.¢., unlimited support of Cuban exiles
sod exile groups with no real control or objective purposes:

in the hope that these groups will be able to sheke the
Castro regime yill, although unrealistic, becoue incressing ty
attractive st various levels in the United States Government.
a. As a matter of policy, political pressures ond
economic pressures short. of blockade, raids, and aggressive



I. Aaa view of the above sSsuaptions prramilitary, command

and sabotage operations, except in rare selective instonces

will serve little Purpose; also they will be counter-procuctive
since, it undertaken, they will make the collection of intalli-
gence nore difficult and Should only be undertrken in those very

* few instances. where’ an unusually ‘high return can be demonstreted,

Regardless of what other pressures are placed on CIA for

action against Cube, it would sppear clear that Higher Authority
will insist ons continued, even intensified, tatelligence
coverage of Cubs.

J “In view of the policy factors, an iacreased use of
facilities, veal estate and ‘basing outside the United States,
particularly in’ Latin ramstonsd will be both necessary snd
desirable. .

Ee. Adequate serial reconnaissance of Cuba will continue.

ix. opgecrives:
Based on the above assumptions, the following objectiven

appear to be proper for continuing CIA operations against
Cuba:

4, Take a11 feasible clandestine sction to isolate
and assist in isolating the Castro-—conmnist regime in Cubs
from the rest of the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the
Free World. . -
Bo. the maxiaum extent possible, discredit the Castro-
coummnist regime in Cuba and in the Festern Healsphere and the
rest of the world.

_ Intelligence, “You will note that this lengthy document

” preaks down under numerous sub-beadings the intelligence
coverage which has been developed.by the Clandestine Service.
Set out below are specifics of operational action it is
proposed to take to continue and, as possible, increase !n-
telligence coverage of Cubs.

1. Intelligence Exploitation of Refugees: As you
know, with the quarantine and the cessation of air
-travel te heavy flow of Cuban refugees has dwindled

Amost “to nothing. In ylew of this and in connection



with the contingency plonning for supporting any pensibis
military action in Cuba, the Opa-Locks Interrogation
Canter as such was dismantled, although. the personnel

of the Center have been retained intact. In order to
Bod the flow of intelligence from refugees,

» at ts Proposed that. Pan Auerican Airways and KLM be

\ Anducea to ‘rolnstitute their reguiar flights from
Havans to Mian. This should be done 26 soon as .
possible after the settlement of the current negotintiens
and UN discussions. Coincident with this, the Ops-locks
refugee interrogation center will be re-established

: ice game personnel.

, Regident. Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be

“nade to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the
viability of and, where necessary, re-establish communica-
tions. with the 131 recruited agents now resident in Cuba.
To an extent, the speed and effectiveness of this effort
will of course depend upon the stringency of future

: Cuban security sad control sction, which it is imposs blo
as yet to accurstely forecast.

3. Third Country Operations: The priority on re-
eruiting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cuba
will be reiterated snd strengthened and every effort

ice be made to increase this coverage, both through
he Bochco essad of additional Fesldent agents in ‘cuba

T=


‘ , a through the development os additional legal travellers.

"6, Penetration of Cuban Installations Abroad: At

the Lisdoieoali time we are running 12 Cuben diplomats

stationed outside Cube as controlled agents and have vishle
‘ dperations aimed’ ‘at. an additional 20 Cuban diplomats.
: We propose te continue and intensify the current progren _

of attempting to recruit or defect every Cuben officin!

concerning whom we have any reason to believe a

" gusceptipility to approach exists. These additional

t tons. As the current situation "ucrmelizes" it shewld
be possible for NSA to reinstitute and perhaps even
‘Anerease their seaborne intercept. coverage of: Cuban
communications. a

: 9. Communist Party Operations: A complete survey
has been made world-wide of all Communist Party
penetration operations and wherever any such penetration
can, be directed egainust Cube either by dispatching the
agent to Cuba or by pointing the agent. against Cubrn

‘targets, “this will be done, except in those cases where

guch action would result in unacceptabigpresudice te

‘the operations in the srea where the agent is now based.

It 1s believed that the most lucrative field for the
redirection of such operations to the Cuban target will
be Latin America where there sre 65 penetrations of
vorious communist parties. Of this 65, the survey

ve bave conducted indicates that 23 have some direct
pertinent access to Cuban targets. All of these 27 wil!
be directed agsinst these targets unless in any cose
there are: overriding Freasons.to the contrary. The
‘reaaining cases in the total of 65 are bein individually

. exanined to see if they can be diverted to Cuban torgets.

10, Illegally Infiltrated Agents: The two

siccessful black infiltrated teans (COBRA and ANTORRID)
"hich have produced substantial intelligence will be

: continued, resupplied, end reinforced but pointed
‘privartly at continued intelligence collection and rt

the vecruituent for intelligence collection purposes of

‘other Cubans who airesdy are legally resident in Cubs

in the areas where the ti orm are opersting (Pinar del
Rio and Oriente). In addition, on the most carefully
selected basis, where it appears feasible, ‘additional
agents ond tens will be infiltrated black into cuba
in an effort to duplicate the perforaance of the COBRA

.2nd AMTORRID teams and particularly to. recruit and, ra

possible, train additional agents legally resident in

1. Exfiltration: 4s feasible, sgents and potentir!
recruita now in Cuba will be exfiltrated for

‘training, indoctrination, supplying with communications,

and motivation. They will then he re-infiltrated inte
Cuba, primarily on intelligence missions. Where possible,
this will be done through legal travo! channels, but
where this is not possible, it will be done wherever
feasible through our black infiltration-exfiltrstion
ilities, primarily our maritine assets,

-ll-


B, Much of the above effort as noted will be primarily

directed towards developing all possible evidences of stress 7
or strain within the regine and between the regine and other
| antions, particularly the Bloc. An intensive program will
ba’ continued to. take advan' of any sible it
- o_weakeny subvert, of split the, in any ple.
fashion. This’ 1s basically # long term effort. A great deni
of work. slready has.goue into this and the current
status of this program and the proposed further expldtation

md the numerous’ leads we ‘have developed is being. made, in

the interests of brevity in this memorandum, the subject of

a sepsrate compilation. Te effectiveness of assets aimed rt
actually splitting the regime, i.@., # palrce revolt, will of
_ cotizse depend, to an extent, on the willingness of the United
 Btates Government to support them and it is entirely possible
| that! any: such effort might fail unless supported with militery
forces ‘which on ‘the basis of the assuaptions in Paragraph I
above would appear unlikely.

C, Sabotage: On the basis of the assumptions set cut
above, commando type sabotage, minor sabotage, and other
acts of sabotage inside Cuba would appear to serve little
purpose end should not be undertaken excopt in the rare
instances where an opportunity is presented with acceptable
Figk to do major damage to the Cuban econony. It is proposed
to contitue searching for such limited opportunities, but

no active or wide scale program 1s contemplated.

-12-



: D, Parantlitary, —Coumsndo, and Guerrille Type Operation:

Given the Asguaptions in Paragraph I above, no wide scale
program ef such activity should be undertaicen, However, we

. prepese to maiotain in being our present facilities snd
the cipability of undertaking. such operaticns in order to
“fully exploit any ‘substantial change in iuternal Cuban con-

. Gitdons or any substantial revolt or uprising which night occur.
: B, Economic Warfare: It is proposed to continue pnd
intensify the program already undertaken to deny through
clandestine aud covert means critical materials to the Cuben
ecououy., This consists primarily of dente operations, poasibiy
sone Freciusive buying and inducing frimdly U.S. and allied
firas and governzents to prevent the shipments of strategic
materials to Cuba.

|B. Gountewintelligence: The current couaterintelligense

" and counterespionage program against the Cuban G-2 snd
related services will be continued and as possible intensified.

This ‘program has developed substantially and it should be
possible within the. coming months to inererse its effectivensss
considerably in countering not only Cuban but Bloc intelli-.
gence operations mounted against United States interests
from Cuba,”

G. Political Action, Propaganda, Psychologica} Warfare:

appropriate intensified: ~

He Exploitation of Exile Gruups: We will continue

the claidestine exploitation of exile Groups for intelligence

collect io, psychological warfare and other approved missicns.
[48 fecathle, we vill act to ount as mich of this effort ox
possible from areas outside the continental United States, end

‘ particularly from Latis America. qf Higher Authority decides

“on “ “Track Two" concept’ or on. any, ‘pimtlar concept which
contemplates ‘heavy uncontrolled and only generally directed
action operations of Cuban groups ageinst Cubs, it is belleved

, that efforts should be made to transfer as such as possible

of the. responsibility for this non-clandestine, non-intelligence
“type, operation ints the political field, which is the province
;of the Department of State. In this connection, it is believed
; it would be edvisable to press for the creation within the

. | Departuent of State of an office of Cuban Exile Affairs tc

hendle the overt government: relationships with Cubsn exile
i Groups.
EV, ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROCEDURAL CHANGES:

Maximm inplementation of the above plan which provides
for the most intensive feasible collection of lntelligenc?,
the implementationof related programs as outlined, and the
maintenance of capabilities to exploit targets of opportunitr
am well as take advantage of any future substantial changes
