These assurances will preclude any meantagful CIA

on a phased basis to provoke a revolt inside Cubr, since

unless there are major changes 1n operationni and Laternal con-

« & practical matter will preclude invading Cuba on the pretext

of à contrived provocation such as an attack on Guantanano.

C. CIA operations involving a high noise level and a

distinot element of attributability, particularly paramilitary,

guerrinidi and commando type operations vill. be unacceptable

an a natter of policy.

Do The Castro-comunist regime will remain in power for

, the indefinite future with its security and control apparatus

rolatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing

unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

conditions in Cuba Increasingly difficult. While It in

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in removing the offensive weapons from Cuba mry

serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there is as yet no laid

indication that the control of the Castro-communist regime

over

Cuba has been substantially weakenod.

3. The Valted States assurances of no lavaBlon and no

support of an invasion will, in effect, constitute giving tr

Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will.
