MEMORANDUM FOR: Legislative Counsel

FROM : B. Hugh Tovar
Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

SUBJECT : Possible Identification of Person in
Photograph Released by the House Select
Committee on Assassinations

1. On 30 July 1978 the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA) released several photographs and com-
posite drawings of persons who the committee hoped might
be able to "shed additional light on the assassinations. of
President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr."

The photographs were shown on a newscast on Channel 5 (WITG)
on 30 July. CIA Career Associate Petr Sergeyevich Deryabin,
who saw the telecast, reported that the photograph showing

a profile view of a man is that of Nikolay Sergeyevich Leonov,
a "journalist" known to Deryabin as a KGB officer.

2. The July-August 1976 edition of the Soviet publica-
tion Latinskaya Amerika contained an article entitled "To
Your Health! Fidel” by "journalist N. S. Leonov." Written
in connection with Castro's 50th birthday, the article
praised Castro highly and implied a personal acquaintance
between Leonov and the Cuban leader. It also briefly
mentioned that the CIA had planned "a physical liquidation
of F. Castro." Deryabin comments that he knows "journalist"
Leonov to be a KGB officer who has worked in Moscow
headquarters as well as in Mexico and Cuba. He believes
that Leonov's implied personal acquaintanceship with Castro
in fact stems from his official position as a KGB officer.
