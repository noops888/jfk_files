would obviously appreciate it if you would.

Are you willing to do so?

Nr, Tweedy. I have no intention of not cooperating.

Ne. Baron. And you are willing to continue to testify
to the truth as hest you can?

Mx. Tweedy. Indeed 1 will.

Mr. Baron, Perhaps we should begin by putting on the
record a bit of your background in Agency activities leading
to the point at which you assumed the position as Chief of
the African Division.

TRSTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY

Mr. Tweedy. I came aborad the Agency in the first of
May, 1947 and after training was sent to Switzerland. +
returned in 1950 and did a series of desk jobs in what was knew
as the Central European Division, I guess, and went through
a number of different assignments at that t{me, until way”
of 1953 when ft went out as Chicf of Station oo Signe

Iwas there until the middle of 1956 and returned very

briefly to the States, went te Bs Deputy Chief of

Station there, I took over as Chief of Station there in

middle of 19Sa cand was then replaced by Frank Wisner, in
bcd,

early in October 1959, and I took over the

African Division I should think somewhere around between the
1Sth and 18th of November 1959,

That brings me up to date.

Mr. Baron. And how long did you serve as Chie fof
the African Division? :

Mr. Tweedy. Until September of '63.

Mr. Baron. In that position ata you consult frequent
with people in policy-making positions at the State Department?

- Mr. Tweedy. Well, as I was explaining to you as we
were strolling around, the simple answer to that is yes
These consultations would take many, many different forms.

On the Congo, for example, the State Department
obviously was just as involved as practically the rest of the
U.S. Government and they had a Congolese task force. 1
would attend their meetings or a representative of mine would

attend their meetings. They took place almost daily,

sometimes I guess even more than once daily.

Mr. Daron, During what period of time?

Mr. Tweedy. on, Lord, from the time the Congo thin;
really hotted up, and I am talking then particularly under the
Kennedy Administration, when Mennen Williams organized the
task force and Wayne Fredericks was hia deputy; those mect-
ings were State's meatings, they weren't CIA meetings, they
weren't nectings primarily to discuss the CIA policy, but
we had to be there to maintain, to keep abreast of what the
policy was.

Mr. Baron. If we could focus our attention on the

period between the independence of the Congo in June of ‘60

and the sonore  CECRET Lumumba in February of

Mr. Tweedy. WAs that tha month of his death?

Mr. Baron. The month the death was announced.

As you know, there is a lot of mystery surrounding his
death and the probable cause of his death. AS far as the U.
investigation was concerned it was January 17 or perhaps
January 18, 1961.

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. What was the nature of your contact with
the State Department during that period ef time?

Mr. Tweedy. My recollection of thia is far less

Congo and far more general, as I was mentioning to you as

“we strolled, and particularly my talks with Jim Penfield,

whom Joe Satterswate was dedicated.

Joe Satterswate, who was Assistant Secretary for
African Affairs, and Penfield and T were colleagues in Vienna
together. He had the minister. Rut we did a great deal ct
talking together about CIA deployment in Africa. 1 was

forming a division both at home and abroad and T had a lot

of things to negotiate with hip |

we wanted ta do, and we spent a qreat deal of time arguing

these things out, making acranaements and so on and so fort!

Mr. Tweedy. All that happened then, absolutely.

Mr. Tweedy. I knew Livingstone Merchant but specific
dincuasions with him I really do not recall, no, Later on

Mr. Baron. Did any of those neet ings concern Lumumba?

Mr. Tweady. Mo, Mr. F , 1 think they exclusively
concerned Portuguese Africa.

Professional contact with Mr, Merchant. T knew him mostly
slightly socially.

Mr. Baron, When you met regularly with ar. Satterswate
or Mr. Penfield did you discuss Lumumba with them?

Mr, Tweedy. iam sure we discussed Lumumba in the
sense of which would be all the time, assessing the situa-
tion, assessing where Lumumba was heading, where the Congo
was heading. I did this with, you know, almost all of the
African situations, individual African country situations.

We would spend a great deal of time, their points of
view, our point of view, cur perspective, their perspective,
but never as an action matter that I can recall.

Mr. Daron, Was the assassination of Patrice Lumumba
ever contemplated or raised in those meetings?

Mr. Tweedy. Never.

Mr. Baron. Did you meet regularly in this period
between Congolese independence and the announced death of
Lumumba with people at the NSC level or people in the White
House? :

Mr, Tweedy. I don't recall so at all. For example, if
President Eisenhower had an African representative the same
way President Kennedy later had, then I can't recall who he
was, President Kennedy had two. The first name escapes

me. He later went on down to South Africa as Ambassador

and one that I saw most of for a considerable period of

time was Carl Kazen, recently retired head of the School of
Advanced Studies in Princeton.

Mr. Baron. During the Eisenhower Administration did
you have direct contact with Gordon Gray or Andrew Goodpaster
with reference to Congolese affairs.

You are shaking your head and we have to put it on
the record,

Mr. Tweedy. I am alsmot convinced that the answer is
no. I am just thinking. I know Gordon Gray quite well, T
gon't recall evor' having. policy discussions with him at all,
nor General Goodpaster. I think the answer is certainly no.

Mr. Baron, You mentioned to me earlier that you had
attended only two National Security Council meetings in your
memory and that those two meetings were both long after the
death of Lumumba, is that correct?

Mr. Tweedy. i can only imagine that they must have been
because this was well into the Kennedy Administration. rT
wouldn't be able to put any dates on it now.

Mr. Baron. It was during the directorship of John
MeCone at CIA?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, that is without question. And
McBundy was at the meetings. Yes, it must have been
well after the death of Lumumba, maybe even the following
year.

Mr. Baron! During the latter part of the Eisenhower

TOP SECRET



Prone {Ares 202) 344-4000

Administration when events in Congo were heatingup, after
Congolese independence, what was the general atmosphere in
the State Department and at the CIA in relation to Lumumba,
the general attitude toward Lumumba?

Mr, Tweedy. Well, I think you would have to start by
saying what was the general assessment of the situation in
the Congo. Lumumba was really sort of the last thing you
came down to.

The worry in WAshington about the situation in the
Congo was that here was the largest geographical expression
in Africa that thretened to go up in smoke, up because the
Kremlin was about to march in and take it over, not because
it was about to break up tribally and do ail the things that
those African countries in their early years were at least
vulnerable to. The only trouble with the Congo was if it
happened there the side effects would have been infinitely
greater than, of course, if it had happened anywhere else.

Mr. Baron, What would those side effects have been?

Mr. Tweedy. ALL one culd do was assess those, but it
would have set a precedent, for example, the neighboring
country by which great store was set by the West was Nigeria
and if the same infection crossed that border one was afraid
that this would go up in smoke and that in effect there
was a possibility of the continent disintegrating before it

really had had a chance to get under way under its own aegis.

This was the concern.

Me. Baron, = Were these political side effects only
that were being taken into account or were thera also
fears for Americah buainess interests in the Congo that
were part of the side effects?

Mr. Tweedy. Insofar as my assessments were concerned,
and those of the Agency and any conversationa I can recall
with the State Department, American business was juat not a
great factor. :

Tf you want to talk about business, the big factor, of

Course, was Katanga and eventually when Tachombe threatened to
succeed resulting in the great invotvamunt of both the Witty ant

the U.S. in the Congo affair, the fear there waa that if you
put together the Congo without Katanga it was Like construct-
ing a Cadillac and purposely omitting the gas station.

Mr. Baron. That is because Kutanga is the home of
most of the natural resources that are in the Congo.

Mr. Tweedy, That is the only thing that keeps that
country going.

Now, I don't say there weren't a lot of economic con-
siderations in back of that but these vere political
economic concerns much more than anything parochial, but is
whatws going to happen to U.S. business was not a factor inso-
far as I recall.

Mr. Baron. So the primary concern was for political

stability in Africa.

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, political stability in africa. In
a quick phrase you put your foot right on that.

Mr. Dawson. During the summer of 1960 you mentioned
earlier that in the time frame you did not think the
Kremlin wae ready to march in there, as that was a fear with
you but --

Mr. Tweedy. I don't mean to Bay this was nothing that
anybody was worred about but it was not the primary concern,

Mr. Dawson, But there was significant Soviet interest
in infiltrating and taking advantago of the situation in the
Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. T think it would be much more accurate
to say i was our assumption, we were not privy to Soviet
intentions with respect to Africa, which r suspect in those
days like a great many other things about african culture
round the globe were i12 informed at that point, and un-
doubtedly seeking | their own poleies in Africa | just the way thia
country was, It was obviously a worry.

Mr. Baron. Was ft also our assumption if the Soviets
moved into the Congo they would move on the side of Lumumba?

wee Tweedy. Oh, yes, I think there would have bean
little doube in our minds that that would have been the case.

Mr. Baron, And is it also true that the general perception

at the Agency and in the State Department was that Lumumba

posed the threat {n the Congo beyond the mére threat of
political instability because of his closeness to the Soviets
or his willingness to accept aid from the Soviets?

Mr. Tweedy. It made the cheese mora binding but I
don't think we had any information indicating there was
any close umbilicus between the Soviets and Lumumba but it
was potentially there

Mr, Baron. And that potential --

Mr. Tweedy. This increased one's nervousness about the
situation.

Mr, Baron, In your capacity as Chief of the African
Division to whom did you report and from whom did you receive
orders?

Mr. Tweedy. Well, the normal chain of command was
through DDD, Dick Bissell and --

Mr, Baron. Would you meet regularly with Richard
Bissell during this period of time?

Mr. Tweedy. Regularly would be a big word. Not
necessarily that often. We might talk on the. phone. To
say that I saw him all the time, how often I don't know, it
would go in fits and starts, undoubtedly but --

Mr. Baron. In formulating actions to be taken in the
Congo, would you consult with Bissell before you undertook
any major operation.

Mr. Tweedy. Well, depending on what you mean by

TOP SECRET

TOP SECRET
major operation, Majer operation per se, if you are not
talking about just intelligence operations, call for in-
structionga and formalization either ineide the Agency or cut-
aide.

Mr. Baron. So any major covert action would be
formulated in consultation not only with Bissell but with the
DCI, Allen Dulles at that time, and probably higher levels
than that.

Mr. Tweedy. I suppose the DCL, if Bissell felt that
was necessary, and, of course, he used to talk to the
DCI without my being present, and undoubtedly certain instruc
tions I would receive from time to time undoubtedly stem from
conversations that Bissell would have had with the DCI and
funnelled down to me.

I didn't always know who talked to whom before I re-
ceived instructions.

Mr. Baron. So if you received an instruction from
Richard Bissel! as DDP you would proceed to implement that
instruction on the assumption it was fully authorized above
the level of DDP?

Mr. Tweedy. I chink I would proceed with it on the
basis that he was authorized to give me instructions
and it was up to him to bloody well know what he was empowered

to tell me to de.

X couldn't run his affairs for him to that extent, but

by and large © reckon the Agency worked and that was the way
it was get up to work and that is the way it worked, but to
Say every time Bissell talked to me he alwaya talked to
Allan Dulles first I would think is nonsense.

Mr, Baron. You didn't consider it your duty to question
Bissell about the source of authority for some covert: action
he was asking you to undertake?

Mr. Tweedy, T would have never hesitated to do if
T felt that it was necessary to do so.

To can't recali having done so. He and I used to have
Aisagreements philosophically on operations. we were very
good friends and I never had any hesitation about telling him
when I thought he didn’t make any sense but ==

Mz. Dawson. Could you describe chat philosophical
difference, or is it describable?

Mr. Tweedy. Well it varied a lot. © think Dick was
by and large inclined to feel that almost anything was
possible, you know, in the clandestine service, if they put
their minds to it, and my view was this wasn't the case.

Mr. Dawson. Thank you.

Mr. Baron, Did you ever discuss the question of
assasainating Lumumba with Richard Biaseli?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, this was the way the whole thing
came up in the first instance, Tocan't remember how it

up except undoubtedly we had a conversation

Mr. Baron, Do you recall when it came up?

Mr. Twaady. Ne, I don't. It obviously must have
come up, I assume, what, the fall of 1960. But I have no
way of putting a date to it.

Mr. Baron. And what waa said during that discussion or
Perhaps I should backtrack first and ask whether this was one
discusaion or a series of discussions?

Mr. Tweedy. Oh, we must have discuased it more than
once, T think it came up in the sense that Dick would have
said wa probably better be thinking about whether it might
ever be neceasary or desirable to get rid of Lumumba, in which
case we presumably should be in position to assess whether we
could do it or not successfully

Mr. Baron. Do it, meaning carry off an assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, but it was never discussed with him
in any other sense but a planning exercise, but a planning
exercise which, in other words, never were we instructed
to do anything of this kind. We were instructed to ask whether
such a thing would be feasible and to have the Chief of
Station he thinking along those lines as well.

Mr. Baron, So, in effect you were asked to move
ahead at least as far as developing the capability to
carry of an assassination if an order should be given?

Mr. Tweedy. Well, or to examine the potential for

doing that.

Mr. Dawson. I know that you have indicated you
won't be able to put a precisa date to this conversation
with Bissell or conversations with Blasell, but maybe we can
narrow it down a little bit.

Would you assume that {t would be after the proclama-
tion of the Congolese independence on June 36, 1960?

Mr. Tweedy. Oh, yes.

Mr, Dawson. Would you assume {t would be before
Lumumba's being put into U.N. protective custody on
Septemberl5, 19607

Mr. Tweedy. I think it must have been, yes.
didn’t realize he had gone into custody that early.

Mr. Baron. So then it would be sometime during the
summer or carly fall of ‘60?

Mr, Tweedy. What happened to Lumumba after that?

Mr. Baron. He was in protective custody at the United
Nations force from mid-September until late November and
it waa in late November that he left to go traveling
towards Stanleyville and he was captured by Mobutu's troops
at that point in very early December and from early December
until mid-January he was in the custody of the Congolese in
prison and then it was in mid-January 1961 that he was
flown from a prison in Tysville to Katanga where his death
was announced shortly thereafter.

Mr. Tweedy. That I recall. I have got to assume it

waa sometime after September 15th. I don't know.

Mr. Baron. When you aay "after" -~

Mr. Tweedy. After you put September 15 the day he
came under. The only thing is I have no recollection that
it would have happened as early as, say, @arly August or
early September,

Mr, Baron. Tt was in August or early September that
Lumumba was Premier of the Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. And there was obviously a struggle for power
between Lumumba and Kasavubu going on.

Mr. Dawson, I guess the crucial question.

Mr. Tweedy. You have really got me at this point.

Mr. Dawson, It would be whether or nat you would have
sonaidered the plan had he been in U.N. protective custody.
Tf you assume that would be the case, then I don't think
any more precision in the date would necessarily be productive.

Mr. Treedy. My whole recollection of the thing would
be that only purpose of the exercise would have been to have
a plan when he waa in nobody's custody,

Mr. Baron. That would have been before -=

tion about the general attitude with regard to Lumumba at
that time. :
Mr. Tweedy. Yes.
Mr. Baron. But, you are saying now, that it would
only make sense to you that --
Mr. Tweedy. In retrospect nothing makes sense to me
but --
Mr. Baron, -- that this initial consideration of the
feasibility of the assassination of Lumumba between Bissell
and yourself?
Mr. Tweedy. f should have thought that would have
been during the period when he was in effect in power, I
should have thought, but the record may prove me wrong.
Me, Baron. Did you have any discussion with Bissell
where he indicated that his own consideration of the assassina-

tion of Lumumba had moved beyond the realm of possibility to

_an actual plan that he was prepared to carry out or taking

steps to carry out.

Mr. Tweedy. © y eannot recall a conversation with
Bissell wherein effect he said, let's move from A to Bor ©

can I recall that I even felt it was imminent that somebody
would say go, (a) we never came up with a plan that was
go~able. or anything really very close to it. It was
always my asaumption that at the time anything like this should
eccur there would have been some kind of real focus on the
problem at probably a very considerable policy level within
the Agency at which somebody would have said something
more about it and it never occurred to me I would get a call
or Bissell would ask me to come down to his office and say
go to it,

Nor were we ever in position where he said that I would
merely implement plan so-and-so. We never got that far.

Mr. Baron. You didn’t have any action plans for
assassination of Lumumba that you had prepared or were aware
of?

Mr. Tweedy. No. Planning, yes, but nothing that ever
got anywhere,

Mx. baron. What kind of planning was done?

Mr, Tweedy, It was mostly the kind of thing where one
asked the Chief of Station to keep in mind what sort of
aceers one might ever have had to Lumumoa ror whatever purpose,
It was this kind of thing, as best I recollect.

Mr. Baron. Did you send cables raising the question of
gaining access to Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating

nim?

Mr. Tweedy, I suspect that was the first cable that

Mr. Baron, I am sorry. i don't think I understood

You say the first cable that went out

Mr. Tweedy. That was the first way that Hedgman was
ever advised that there was any thinking of that kind in
Washington, was via our cable. Iam sure he wasn't back in
the States over anything of this kind.

Mr. Baron, Today you distinctly remember a cable sent?

Mr. Tweedy. I think I remember that much more distinct-

ly than anything I remember in the last few minutes that it
was a cable which asked him to be thinking of that.

Mr. Baron, Or the effect of the language in the cable? '

Mr. Tweedy. The effect of the language in the cable -
would be to get Hedgman to be thinking along these lines.

Mr, Dawson, Would you describe the purpose?

Mr, Tweedy. It would have been the eventuality that we
might wish to get rid of Mr. Lumumba personally.

Mr. Dawson. Ts that language you think might have
been used or that 19 how you think it might have been done?

Mr, Tweedy. I couldn't even start to reproduce the
cable.

Mr. Baron.- Did you send a number of such cables to
the Chief of Station?

Mr. Tweedy. I {magine there werea few over a period
of time. It was not an intensive correspondence as I
remember it,

Mr, Baron. It wouldn't be thenormal practice to
have an intensive correspondence on such a sensitive subject,
would it? . -

Mr. Tweedy. I don't know, It is the only time I ever
had one but I have had very sensitive subjects,operationally
sensitive hubjects that I have dealt with in extensive
cables over a vary long period of time, but nothing of this
nature whatsoever,

Mr. Baron. — Were these cables from headquarters to

thea Chief of Station in Leopoldville sent in a specially

TOP SECRET



restricted. channel?
Mr. Tweedy. Yes, ali sensitive cables are sent in
various types of restricted channela I am gure you aware.
Mx. Baron. This channel even more tightly held and
closely restricted than the normal cable traffic that would

flow to the Chief of Station?

Mr. Tweedy. That would be a very fair statement,

Mr. Baron. Do you know whether the cable included in-
structions to destroy it after reading it?

Mr. Tweedy, That wouldn’t have been normal.

Mr. Baron. Would you assume that on a subject like this
such an instruction would have been given?

Mr. Tweedy. It would really be up to the Chief of
Station, I think, It would be up to the Chief of Station
“what was in the cable and the degree to which he felt he
needed to maintain # record for quick reference purposes in
the future, 7 ~
: But, he was perfectly capable of keeping a file
which would be accessable only to him and the station and
if he was sure of his own security within the station I don't
think this would have been a problem for him,but to answer your

Mr. Tweedy. It was a serious answer. I can't do
better than that. It was a serious answer, It wasn't argu-
mentative, I guess it started to diacusa, not the pros and
cons of policy,at least I don't recall it did, but “what it
was that he might be able to do. It was a disciplined reply
to an instruction from headquarters,

Mr. Baron. Did he mention any specific means that
he had of gaining access to Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. EX don't recall now. I don't recalk. I
think he said it was certainly not beyond the question that
means cauld either be developed or might arise but I certainly
do not recall that he came up.with any very specific ideas in
the first instance. On that I am afraid 1 am terribly hedgy.

Mr. Baron. At the time that you were requesting the
Chief of Station to report back on means of gaining access
to Lumumba for the purpose of climinating him, was this
access made any more explicit in terms of the kind of |
personal access that would be needed? -

Mr. Tweedy, I am sure that must have been covered
at some point,i.e., in perhaps a series of types of accesses.

Mr. Baron, Would this be access to shoot him or would
this be access to his personal food or drink or toiletries?

Mr. Tweedy. I suppose all those types of things might
have been considered.

Mr. Baron. But this was not access in the sense of -~

finding a way to sneak ineide the U.N. guard to simply
snatch Lumumba from custody, this waa clearly accesa to assassin-
ate him, {6 that correct?

Mr, Tweedy. That would certainly be my recollection,
Kidnapping was never a factor that i recall at all or aven
considered,at least I don't remember it.

Mr. Baron, Im your discussions with Richard Bissell
about the prospect ef assassinating Lumumba, did he mention to
you that he had had aimilar discussions with Gustin O'onnell?>

Mr. Tweedy. I was reminded of Yuatin o'Donnell’s
role in all this. AB you may recall, when I talked to you
and Mr. Wides, and until you reminded me I had forgotten
that ust n-O"DoANeLL played any role whatsoever and now
that it has been brought to my recollection I recall it.

I recall it almost in detail.

I remember being told that he had expressed reservations
or disagreement or refusal to participate to Bissell and 1
think my response to you was if he Said that 1 would believe
him bute I didn't recall it.

Mr. Baron. Did Richard Bissell ever indicate ta you

saying, I am going to send Q'DoniielT sto the Congo to knock
off Lumumba, not in those words.

Mr. Baron, When you say examine the thing on the ground
you mean he would send O'Donnell to the Congo to take a
first-hand look at the means?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, conceivably I suppose this all
might have resulted ina climax there but at least my racollec-

tion certainly was never that he told me that I am sending

Pa
‘O'Detineli,to the Congo to knock off Lumurba in those words

but that he, I am sure the philosophy was that if anything
was done you would want to keep it as separate from the
station as possible and thus a man from the outside,
Tt was Bisseli's idea that Q'Connehl might be the man.
Baron, The man from outside?
» Tweedy. Outside the station,
Baron. The CIA station in the Congo?
Tweedy. Right.
Baron. That such’ a man would be “necesaary to
carry out an assassination operation {f one were to be mounted?
Mr. Tweedy. That if one was mounted it would
obviously be desirable to do it under auspices which would
protect the security of the station er involvement of the
station,
That T am sure was the philosophy behind it.

Mr, Baron. Rut it is your recollection that OY SMREri

Mr. Tweedy. That-is certainly my recollection but 1
would not want to put too high a value on it. I
juse don*t recall kidnapping as a factor 4a all.

Mr, Baron, Did Richard Bussell ever mention to you that

lethal biological agents had been developed in the CIA
laboratories for possible use in the Congo to assassinate Lumum-
ba? Or they were available for such use?

Mr, Tweedy. I think that it would be closer that TSP
probably had the capability or had the agent or whatever i ~
was. When I gay agent I mean chemical agent. I suspect I
heard that, yea.

Mr. Baron. Would this have been under
auspices or direction in TSD?

have been. I don't recall. Was he? I think he was.

come up as one means that was being considered and which
the Chief of Station should axplore?

Mr. Tweedy, I am sure it must have. After all,
there are not many ways of doing it. Shoot a man, poisen
him, of course you could,-I suppose, stab him or something
like that. But basically you are talking about a contingency
plan which I assume has the best possibility of protecting the
involvement of the U.S. Government and if you want to do it
in a manner which would be as distant, 1f that is thea right
word, as posaible, I think poison would then stand high on the
list of possibilities.

Mr. Daron. Did the Chief of Station ever make a
response to you via cable which indicated that he was ex-
ploring means of gaining access to Lumumba for the possible
use of poisoning -- purpose of poisoning him. o

Mr. Tweedy. I am sure he must have done that. = I
don’t recall specifically, but that effect is what he was
charged to do in the first instance, examine the possibilities.

I would be very surprised if Hedgman didn’t come back
and in effect comment on this but the nature of his comments
I really don't recall.

Mr. Dawson, When you and Bissell had your conversa-
tions, whatever time it was, concerning this matter, did he
mention to you that he had approval or direction from highest

authority to undertake. to assassinate Lumumba?

the impression when he talked to me that -~ 1 don't know

whether this ia fair or not -- I honestly don't know what

my impression was at the time whether this was something that
Bissell had in effect aucked out of his own thumb as a

contingency plan which he then raised with higher authority, and

because it was contingency planning I don't think at that
stage I was particularly concerned, But to anawer the
question I just don't know.

Mr. Dawson, You stated earlier you knew Gordon

Mr, Baron. Richard Bissell never made a representation
to you one way or the other as to whether he had approval from
any authority higher than DOP for this consideration of
assassinating Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. No, I do not recall so.

did, but he might have done it, I wouldn't gainsay it, he

Mr. Wides and my answer was that T don't recall it, but that
it was perfectly possible for them to be sent there.

Mr. Tweedy. They could have been sent one or two ways,
they would have been sent through the pouch with the whole
thing wrapped in ardaddressed in such manner that it would be
opened only by the Chief of Station or somebody coming out
by hand of officer or hand of somebody either way it could

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge of a meesenger
from CIA headquarters having t6 go to the Congo to Provide
the Chief of Station in the Congo with instructions to carry
out the assassination of Lumumba,if possible, and also pro-
vide him with the tools to carry out such an assassination,

namely, poisonsand medical equipment for administering them?

Mr. Tweedy, No, I do not,
Mz. Baron. Let me represent to you that we have

testimony from the Chief of Station in the Congo at that

point that he had received a cable from headquarters saying that

Did you ever know of such a cable being sent to the

Conga?
Mr. Tweedy, I should be very surprised if I didn't,
but I certainly have m recollection of it-whatsoever.
Mr. Baron. And the Chief of Station further testi tied

a that shortly after receiving such a cable he received a viait

Were you aware of that chain of events?
Mr. Tweedy. That sounds far more definitive than

thing I have any recollection of at all.

Titer

If I understand what you said waa, Gottlish'would have

left instructions with the Chief of Station which would have
empowered the Chief of Station at the conclusion of their

conversations, to go out and assassinate Lumumba, without any
further recourse or reference to headquarters?

Mr, Baron, That is ==

Mr, Tweedy. If that is the case I don't believe it.

Mr. Baron, That is the essence of the testimony that
the Chief of Station although he did say that he was not anxious
to carry out an assassination mission. ile Aidn/t think it was
practical or wise and he probably would have gone back
to headquarters to consult with them if he thought he
was in a position to move immediately to carry out the assass-
ination plan, but it was his opinion that the policy decision
had been made and that he had authority to movel ahead
although he doubted --

Mr, Tweedy. My recollection doesn't go anywhere near
chat far.

Mr. Dawson, He checked that authority by! immediately
cabling back to headquarters eaying,this quy has made himself
available to me as well as he has delivered something and

has told me that he had the approval of the highest authority

TOP SECRET



in the land to order me to do what he so ordered, which got
another cable back through the specially slugged cable saying
yes, what he told you is correct

Mr. Twaedy. I don't recail that, which aurprises
me, bocause once again I would be very surprised, 1 wouldn't
have been privy to those.

Mr. Baron. If a request such as the plan Mr. Dawson

outlined had been sent from the Congo to headquarters and it

were in more narrow cryptic terms, for instance, if it had
said simply I have seen your messenger and received inatruc-
tions and request confirmation that xX am to carry them out,
would thet refresh your recollection aa to whether you had
seen such a cable?

Mr. Tweedy. =: I can't be at all sure it will refresh
my recollection but if you and Hedgman say that such a cable
was sent, I am not going to gainaay it.

Mr. Baron. Would that be the manner in which
confirmation for such a sensitive operation would be requested?

Mr. Tweedy. I don't know because I never saw one be-
fore or since but it sounds highly reasonable to me. ‘This
is the way, this would be the way I should have thought -any
two sensible people would confer on sensitive matters when
each knew that the other knew exactly what he was talking
about and, of course, you don't have to use unnecessary words

but beyond the likelihood of this I can't say that is what

Mr. Tweedy. Or I literally don’t recall it. This is my
problem, I will tell you quite frankly with these things --

Mr, Dawson. It is 15 years ago. ;

Mr, Tweedy. I really am having trouble with this. 1

I recall the most vividly about all my African experiences ;
were basically the things I was basically concerned with all
the time which was putting this division together and the
rest of it.

When it comes to operational detail I start getting
fuzzy and you would have thought with something like “thinking
about Mr. Lumumba in these terms, that I would have gone to

bed and got up thinking about Lumumba, I can assure you this
wasn't the case.

I spent days in a row not even giving Lumumba one

appointment was already in the works when I came aboard and
I had met Hedgman in London on his previous assignment which,
4f I remember correctly, was in Brussels and he came to Lon-
don to discuss an operational matter with me’ which had
nothing whatsoever to do with that and we had a very good
discussion. It was only, I think, when I yot back to
headquarters as it were, took up the reins after the division
that I learned that he had been appointed Chief of Station
in the Congo, a decision with which I took absolutely no

exception whatsoever, but as a number of assignments may be

to proceed without reference to anybody #lse he wouid pre-
‘sumably go ahead and do so.

Mr. Baron. But, becauso the feasibility of this
aggagsination of Lumumba had been Giscuseed, this was not such |
a tightly held subject that the DDP would have been circum-
vanted?

Mr. Tweedy, DDP as far as I was concerned was the
person with whom the division first discussed the matter en-
tirely. I don't recall ever having discussed it with Alien
Dulles. I am sure when I say I am sure I assume Bissell dis-
cuased it with Allen Dulles but, this was never a matter
which was between the DCI’s office and the Leopoldville
station insofar as I was aware, and to this day I don‘t
believe it ever was.

Mr. Baron. Just to clarify something we talked about
earlier when I think we were jumbling two questions together,
it is your expert opinion, expert in the sense of your knowi-
edge of the Agency, and your opinion as a participant at that

time that the testimony, the ‘basic testimony we have received

about poisons being delivered to the Congo by (Sr

instructions to use them in the assassination of Lumumba,
if possible, would be true testimony?

Mr. Tweedy. Only way I can answer that question, Mr.
Baron, is to aay I see not the rlightest reason and do not

belteve that you would have been lied to on this point.

But, there {8 nothing in my experience with the Agency
which would really bear on that point whatsoever.

Mr. Baron, Did you travel to tha Congo shortly
before the independence of the Congo waa declared?

Mr, Tweedy. That was my first visit to the Congo as I
recall, it was two weeks before independence. T made a
long trip through Sub-Saharan Africa which culminated in
a drive from Kampala to Sambura and I flaw from Sambura, I
guess, to Albertville and from Albertville to Leopoldville
and that ie thefirat time I ever saw Leopoldvilie.

Mr. Dawson. Po you know whether Mr. Hedgman was
there at that time?

Mr. Tweedy. Mr. Hedgman I am almost sure was
not. His predecessor was there. He had many children, I
can‘t remember his name,

Mr. Baron. And you left the Congo before
independence was declared.

Mr. Tweedy, Yes, I was only, there, for, { suppose I
was there for four or five days and I thought 1 was going to

end my whole tour there and whole trip there but eventualiy

i had to go up to the Ivory Coast to settle an unexpected

that independence was declared about June 30, 19607

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. Did you make another trip during which

you visited the Congo at some point before the death of

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, well, it 4s this one that I regurgi-

part of December and which had startod with a visit to Rome
in the latter part of November, followed by a trip to Nairobi
followed by a brief visit to South Africe, then I think Congo,
then briefly Brazzaville and home via Europa.

ef the exercise was that he wanted to meet a large number of ,
our new Chiefs of Stations in Africa and rather than make a tri
around Africa, which he hardly hud time, he used a device
which we often used, which is to hold regional meetings at
a central point to which these people could have ready access
and, therefore, it was easy for people on the north Mediter-
ranean littoral or South Mediterranean littoral to proceed to
Rome, and the same way it was easy for East African Station
Chiefs to proceed to Nairobi, and he had the meetings there,
each one two or three days, I suppose.

Mr. Baron. Did the Chief of Station in the Congo
attend the meeting in Rome?

Mr. Tweedy. I am sure he would not. In other words,
if he saw Rissell he would have merely come to Rome and have
seen him, but he would have had no reason whatsoever, in

fact it would have been ridiculous for Bissell to invite a

man who didn't, belong in the North African meetings and merely

raised the question whether ledgman was there.

Mr. Baron. What region in the CIA organization chart
would the Chief of Station in the Conga belong to?

Mr. Tweedy. We change amound there. We had in

It might have fallen just in French-speaking West Africa.

We always had aghrenchpiestREFICs, anQEnglistrepeakings

Mr, Baron. We have received testimony from the Chief
of Station in the Congo at that point that he did cama to
Rome to meet with Richard Bissell and he belives that he also
met with yourself and Mr, Karamessines at Mr. Karamessines'
house.

Mr. Tweedy. I doubt if he saw Mr, Karamessines. It
would only be because Mr. Karamesaines was host as Chief of
Station in Rome. But I am sure he was not discussing any

policy problems with Mr. Karamessines who had absolutely no

jurisdiction over them in those days whateoever.

Mr. Baron. That was his testimony, but it was incidental,
but if, as he has testified, that he met with Mr. Bissell and
yourself, you wouldn't dispute that testimony?

Mr, Tweedy. Absolutely not.

Mr. Baron, And that would be due to the intensity of
activity in she Congo at this point and the intensity of
concern over that activity?

Mr. Tweedy. Absolutely. It was obviously becoming more
and more of a commitment of both the U.S. Government and

thus the agency. I think leaving Lumumba entirely aside this

at that point was the fact that it obviously was going to become
a major personnel drain, 4f you like, on the Division :
and a major commitment both at headquarters and in the

field, thus it was important I sort of look the thing over.

Mr. Baron. Having refreshed your recollection about
thia moeting between the Chief of Station and Mr. Bissell and
yourself in Rome, do you recall what was discussed when you
were together?

Mr. Tweedy. I can only assume that some of the things
that we discussed by cable traffic were dincussed.

The other thing I am sure must have been discussed was
what I would cali the general assessment of the Congolese
situation and what the station might be required te do, thus
the sort of aupport headquarters was going to have to give
the Station.

Mr. Baron, Was there any discussion of the assassination
of Lumumba or the prospect of --

Mr. Tweedy. I would he immensely surprised if it
wasn't discussed but I don't recal! in what context it was
discussed, In fact, I don't believe it wasn't discussed.

It was after all on the agenda, as it were, at least I
assume it was, at that point

Mr, Baron. The prospect of assassinating Lumumba con-

tinued to be on the agenda of the Agency until the point that

!

Mr. Tweedy. I don't recall, You probably are much note
knowledgeable on that than I am. I don’t recall when in
effect we no longer considered it or it no longer was a
factor. I just don't remember.

Mr. Baron. But, just now you were assuming that that
would have the case?

Mr. Tweedy. If it was still on, it was still on
the agenda, inevitably we must have discussed it. If it was
off the agenda then no, but 1 honestly don’t remember.

Mr. Baron. Let me show you now some cable traffic
between the agency and Leopoldville which consists of a
series of cables that begins shortly before Lumumba was placed
into U.N. custody, then continues after he was placed in U.N.
custody.

In an attempt to refresh your recollection about the
attitude at the Agency toward Lumumba after he was in U.N.
custody --

Mr. Tweedy. Okay.

Mr. Baron, -- the first cable which we will mark Tweedy
Exhibit 1 is dated August 26, 1960, from Leopoldville te the
Director.

(The document referred to was

Mr. Baron, Onthe record.

Let's turn back now.

I believe while we were off the record and axamining this
cable closely you corrected me, Mr. Tweedy, on the fact that
this cable was not sent from Leopoldville to the Director but
rather it was sent from headquarters to Leopoidville;s is
that correct?

Mr. Tweedy. Correct.

Mr. Baron. And it appears to you from the designation

"Allen W. Dulles", at the top of the telegram, that this was

a personal message signed off by the DCI himself to the Chief
of Station.

Mr. Tweedy. Correct, As I said, he might not have
drafted it but it certainly would have been his sign off.

vir. Haron, And let me direct your attention to
the portion of the cable that says in high quarters here it is
the clear-cut conclusion that if LLL continues to hold high
office the inevitable result will at best be chaos and at
worst pave the way to a Communist takeover of the Congo with

disastrous consequences for the prestige of the U.N. and for

the interests of the Free World generally.

Consequently we conclude that his removal must be an

urgent and prime objective and that under existing condit::
thia should be a high priority of our covert action.

Now, do you believe that LLL refers to Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. T do.

Mr. Baron. And why would three L's have bean used in
the cable?

Mr. Tweedy. I don’t know.

Mr. Baron, Would that be a standard way of making sure
that at least one of the L's was clear in transmission?

Mr. Tweedy. I honestly don't know,

Now, that isn't the normal way to do it at all. 1

LLL does refer to Lumumba?

Mr, Tweedy. I do indeed.

Mr. Baron, Does this accord with your general sense
of the policy toward Lumumba at that time at the Agency anc :

Mr, Tweedy. It accords much more with my recollect:
of our attitude toward the potentially disastrous situatic
the Congo than it does on he personally, but he obvious}:

Mr. Tweedy. I must say I have a hard time following the
question. This means that Lumumba arrived under the Congo-
lese auspices in Kutanga and that Elizabethville, the base at

Elizabethville didn't know he was coming, our ba didn't

know very much, didn't presumably know very much about what
occurred, and reported very briefly on what they had heard.

Mr, Baron. Let me put the question in context.

On January 17, Lumumba had been flown to Kutanga?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

Mr. Baron. And later United Nations investigations co-
cluded that. it was the 17th or perhaps the 18th that Lumumba
was actually killed in Kutanga,

I was asking you before whether this cable would indi-
cate that the United States would have been involved in
bringing about the death of Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. I would have thought that it merely in-
digates that this part of the Agency, i.e., Elizabethville
had no idea he was coming, knew nothing about his fate
except these few phrases that he put down here and would imp:
although it certainly doesn't say go, that he was adding a
little information to what was perhaps an enormously ignoran:
Leopoldville which, of course, is the fact of the matter
We didn't know how all this was occurring and were not able

to follow the event except after the event.

Mr, Baron. Was the CIA connected in any way to the

events that immediately led to Lumumba’sa death?

Mr. Tweedy. None whatsoever,

Mr. Baron. CIA was not involved in a plot to fly
Lumumba from his previous place of imprisonment in Tyaville
out to Kutanga where the authorities were known to be so
hostile to him that he would probably meat his death there?

Mr. Tweedy. The fate of Lumumba in the end was purely
an African avent.

Mr. Baron, At what point did you learn of Lumumba's
death?

Mc. Tweedy. I suspect probably about the time that the
world did. No one had a beat on this.

Mr. Baron, You had no advanced warning that Mobutu in-
tended to fly Lumumba to Katanga?

Mr. Tweedy. Not that I recall, and I am gure the cable
traffic would reflect it if I had.

Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy, do ‘you recall an asset who was

sent from Europe, where he had been recruited a Ks

Mr, Tweedy. I think Iwas reminded of this when I talked

Mr. Baron. This would be an asset who went by the

written by the Chief of Staff D without consultation with the
Chief of the African Division?

Mr. Tweedy. He did consult, that is to say, he wrote.
the dispatch. 1 haven't read the whole thing but I gather
from this -- you see there is also a reference here. I don't
know what the reference is about. But I gather that Dakar is
brought into this activity because they wanted to act in a
qupport capacity to this headquarters activity.

cerned with?

Mr. Baron. Would it have been proper for the Chief of

Staff D to arrange an operation in the Congo directly without
going through the African Division although keeeping the
African Chief informed?

Mr. Tweedy. Well, the two are mutually exclusive.
You can't have one without the other. To answer your firat
question, it would be quite improper and wouldn't have occurred
that the Chief of Staff D was operating in an African Station
without the African Division being informed. This, however,
makes it amply clear that that was not the case, the African
Division was informed. In what depth in terms of terms of
headquarters purposes I don't know but it would have been
sufficient for Harvey to have done what he did and coordinate
this with the Division and if the Division had perceived
any objection or saw any problems they would have raised it
before the dispatch went out.

Also I noticed Dakar ia also invited to find problems
with this, if it did, and say sol 7° >

Mr. Baron. Would it be surprising to you that QUWIN migit
have been used in some manner in connection with an assassina~

Mr. Tweedy. It would have surprised me exceedingly and
would today. To put it differently, I am gure it didn’t occur.

Mr. Baron. After reading this memo, you told ma a

moment ago that you thought this might indicate that QUWIN

was being recruited for ZRRIFLE activitie:

Mr. Tweedy. Well, you mentioned ZRRIFLE, which frankly
I hadn't heard before. Thia sounds as if he was going to
have some kind of generic assignment. I merely put those
two together but I know nothing about it at all.

Mr. Baron, The dispatch saya, “In view of the extrenc
sensitivity of the objective for which we want him to perform
his task, he was not told precisely what we want him to do.”

Do you have any knowledge of what it was precisely that
QJWIN was asked to do?

Mr. Tweedy. I do not.

hie fellow Europeans who might be traveling through the
Congo?

Mr, Tweedy, Ido recollect that and you brought it
to my attention, when you and Mr. Wides and I discussed this
4 couple of months ago. I do remember the cryptonym and
remember generally the circumstances in which he was sent as
a sort of general purpose agent to the Congo with the thought
4f we got involved in paramilitary activity he would be helpful
and he was recruited on that rather general basis, and when you
discussed with me a later alarming exchange of cables which
indicated that he landed running and made some rather {rrespon-
sible remarks and we commented on them to the station.

My best recollection is that in the long haul he stayed
on in the Congo and I think became, I beliuve he became a
somewhat useful intelligence source, but Hedgman would
have a much better recollection of that. But I do remember
quite well his dispatch. He had been seen.by two or three
members of my Division, including my-deputy. I don't
recall that I ever met him unless 1 met him in the Congo.
If I did T just don't remember. But I remember he was assease.
as it were, recruited in the United States and dispatched on

a general purpose mission.

Mr. Baron, So, he would be vicwed as one of the major

asseta that Hedgman had in the Congo at that point?

Mr. Baron. Would one of those things for which he was
qualified have been an assassination mission against Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. As I told you previously, told you and Mr.
Wides previously, absolutely not, for the simple reason he was
basically dispatched, assessed and dealt with by the balance
of the pivision, not by me personally, Glenn Fields person-
ally, and he wae in effect a station ao set mounted by the
Division.

the Division knew nothing about the balance of this

yourself and Fields would indicate to you that he wasn't

Mr. Tweedy. I will put it differently. As far as
I know he was never conaidered for an assassination niasion
at ali.

He thought he was presumably being sent ouf for deeds
of daring in the PH “teld and began to talk rather lusty when
he arrived, but f think he was soon put straight.

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I know that. This is the one we dis-

Mr. Baron, We are referring specifically to QUWIN's

ticipate in intel net and be member".--1 am sorry -- "member

Mr. Tweedy. Yes; I remember a1] of this aa a result
of your having previously brought it to my attention and I
recall it, it was a typical example of an agent or asset
full of piss and vinegar exceeding his brief and he was
certainly put back on the track very early on.

But in this business do not confuse: execution squad
with anything to do with the assassination of Lumumba or any-
thing else. It had nothing to do with that.

Mr. Baron. You are saying even though you would
assume that Mr. Hedgman's testimony about poisons coming to
the Congo and instructions to carry out an assassination
coming to the Congo was true, the approach that WIROGUE made
to QJWIN was probabiy not a part of that mission.

Mr. Tweedy. It was quite specifically not a part of
that miasion. There was a chapter of accidents. You have

Mr. Baron. Again, why are you so eure that this would

Mr, Tweedy. i thought I made that clear because
this man went out up to a point through what I would call
the open channel, it was developed by the Division, giving

training by the Division and was sent out. This had: nothing

to do whatsoever with the othor thing and wouldn't have been

handled that way.

Mr. Baron. Could he have been instructed by Mr.
Hedgman, after he got to the Congo, that he was to undertake
recruitment of assets for participation in an assassination
mission as part of his general duties in the Congo?

Mr. Tweedy. It is purely a speculative question. He
could have been but Hedgman would also have been required
and would have told headquarters what he was doing with him.
That was not the purpose for his being sent. The purpose for
which he was sent out was unspecific at the time, generally
in the PM field,

period, during this period, but I don’t recall any discussions.

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, sir. Not necessarily that, because

that could possibly be used if we aver wanted to use something.
Mr. Baron. You might have had at least an exploratory
conversation with him on that eubject?
Mr. Tweedy. I would be surprised if. I didn't.
Or perhaps Bussell had a conversation with hin and then I
followed it up, something like that. I would suspect that
probably the firet conversation would undoubtely have been

Mr. Baron. 1 am at the end of my questions on specific
facts concerning the Congo during this period of time leadine
dp to Lumumba's death which, as you know, is the narrow
subject of our inquiry right now, and first of all I want
to say that I appreciate tremendously and know ‘that the
Committee is appreciative and grateful for your testimony
here today. It is a difficult subject. tt is only one
narrow aspect of what the Committee is undertaking, and un-
pleasant, but unnecessary aspect to assemble.

1 wonder if you have any facts that you would like to
to the record that you think are necessary to put our dis-
cussion today into context? ;

Mr. Tweedy. 1 think the strongest..recollection about

TOP SECRET

my period as Chief of the African Division and the Congo --

70

let's leave the balance of Africa out -- and U.N. and U.S.
involvemant in the Congolese matter, that 1 have never seen
an @lement of the Agency so totally involved in a matter which
clearly had the highest policy approval. 1 am not talking
about Lumumba, I am talking about the Congo.

Mr. Baron. Thare was an extreme senee of urgency at
that time?

Mr. Tweedy. Not only an extreme sense of urgency, ,.
the U.S, waa supporting the U.N., the Agency was supporting
the U.S. Government, the U.S. Government requests. “wnat the
Agency was doing was very closely coordinated appropriately
with any organs of government that need to be covered, mostly
State, the White House. I must say the fxecutive Department
was very much working as a team during these days. AGain for-
get Lumumba. I am now talking the whole Congo action. And
I never felt that anything we were doing was wandering off
to left field or that I didn't know the way the White House was
thinking about things, or the State Department was thinking
about things, and the National Security was thinking about
things, and I have no reason to believe they ever felt that t
didn't know how CIA was thinking about things, It was an extra-
ordinarily close thing.

I remember Mennen Williams trying to form «

Congo club, When I retired From the African Division T was

given a little thing for a watch chain, if 1 had one,

which would be a member of tha Congo Club, and it was rather
typical of the way the government worked on this thing and 1
personally felt excallent advised that the U.S. was absolutely
right to support the U.N. on this. I think it could have been
a total disaster if Kutanga had been allowed to succeed,

and although Mobutu was acting like an aes now, that is
Africa for you, but on the whole that country has done pretty
well and I consider we had a considerable role in giving it

@ chance to move the way it has.

There are going to be ups and downs with the things
hut that is the way it is. I feel very stronaly about it.

Does that somewhat answer your question,
does that help?

Mr, Baron.I simply wanted to give you a chance.

Mr. Tweedy. I felt that very strongly and no other assiqu-
ment that 1 have ever had was thie kind of government team
and cooperation ever really required. because we weren't
engaged or I wasn't engaged in that kind of activity.

Mr. Daron, Is this government team efforts that you ar«
talking about one that was primarily put together to carry
out the paramilitary activities in the Congo in the
latter part of the 60's, ‘62, ‘63.

Mr. Tweedy. It was put together to preside over what-

ever activity the United States Government felt it needed

to be engaged in in the Congo. This included such thinga as

72

purely policy questions of what the Ambassddor to the U.N.

might say to the Secretary General of the U.N.or what the

ene e carte 207) 544-4000,

President might want to say conceivably I suppose to the
Chief of the Belgium state on such matters, Everything
certainly didn't juat involve what CIA was going to be
involved in. It was the whole policy ball of wax with ros-
Pect to the Congo which obviously had many ganglia and which
the CIA part and paramilitary activity was just a bit.

Mr. Baron. Did this high degree of organization and
intensity of concern bagin sometime after the death of fumumba
or had it gotten rolling?

Mr. Tweedy. I think --

Mr. Baron, After the Congolese tndependence?

Mr. Tweedy. I think the U.S. Government was thoroughly
seized with the intimate problem and danger of a disintegrating
Congo that started in the earliest days of independence
and continued and, of course, when the Tschombe-Kutanga
thing became a fact of life, which is basically why the U
was there, then, of course, that was it.

Tn other words, I would say that U.S. involvement, U.s.
concern, merely moved with the events, as anybody could read
them in the press just continued and continued, hut one thins
was perfectly clear, was that the .8. was quite determined

to see this thing through. Nothing had been clearer than

the way President Kennedy presided over those two meetings.
He was annoyed by the Congo and irritated by it and he was
worried that he had to spend so much bloody time on it, but
he was damn well determined to see the thing through and he
was continually goosing his staff to do just that , but

in support of the U.N. We weren't going to do it all by
ourselves. It couldn't have been clearer,

Mr. Baron. All right, as I mentioned before, the
Committe is interested in your wisdom on policy-making and
analysis in the intelligence community yenerally and there may
be other members of the Committee staff that would iike to ca!
upon you to testify on other subjects because of your long
experience in Agency activities.

But EF want to thank you now for your complete coopera-
tion and the tremendous amount of information that you have
provided on this one subject that has been very helpful?

Mr. Tweedy. Thank you, Mr. Baron. I can assure you any-
thing I can do to help the Committee in other areas [I
will be glad to do it and if I don't think | can help be-

cause I don’t think I know enough about the subject I will

Say so, Gthervise I am not afraid te put a, two bits in.

Mr. Baron. As far as your two hits goes, we would
be interested in your two bits wort 1 poitcy recommendativ.
in yeneral, institutional, critiaue or suggestions for chance

or any kind of recommendations that you would care to make,

and wa will take that up at some point in the future, But :
you have obviously had a good deal of experience at the policy :

That is all, thank you.

Mr. Tweedy. All right, than you very much.

(Whereupon, at 3:55 p.m., the hearing was concluded.)
