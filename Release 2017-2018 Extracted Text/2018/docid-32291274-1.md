to appear on two old traffic charges. QUARTARONE was

also charged with operating a vehicle with an invalid driver's

license. Located in QUARTARONE's automobile was a sack of

25 cent slugs,

apparently prepared for use in telephones.

QUARTARONE said he had come to Miami several days previously

to stand trial with RALPH GEORGE SHEA (Miami File 165-6) as

both were charged on 2/13/62, with "Entering

without Breaking,

a Public Telephone Booth to commit a felony." This trial

however, has been postponed, to an undetermined date.

MM 609-C advised that subsequent to the arrest

of RALPH GEORGE SHEA, on 2/18/63, when he was charged with

"illegat dissemination of racing information" that SHEA is

again disseminating racing results, but the time lag is now

20 - 25 minutes after the horse race is run.

EDWARD SALEM, PCI, furnished similar information

to the above and added that SHEA has only a few bookmaker

clients for his race results, because they believe he istoo

prone to arrest and his race

¿outs are sometimes unreliable.

Washington Avenue, Miami Beach, and were charged with accepting

- bets without purchasing a Federal gambling stamp. These two

Miami Beach, which was the "check-in point" for this

operation

operation with THOMAS ALTAMURA (Miami File 92-410).
