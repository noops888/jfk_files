The substance of this preliminary report covers debriefing sessions

held with AMPÁNIC-T from 7 through 15 November 1960. Both Mir. Pekich and the

undersigned participated in these debriefing periods. The pertinent aspects

of these debriefing sessions are summarized into four specific categories:

AMPANIC-7's operational activities in Cuba from his initial

arrival in Cuba 5 August until his departure 5 November 1960.

b. Internal assets developed in Cuba for luture operational

use.

C. Problems encountered by A-? while operating in Cuba.

d. Projected

future assignment in Cuba.

2. Mr. James Pekich, who was AMPANIC-7's case officer during his initial

training in Washington, was contacted by phone from Miami by subject on

7 lovember.

Subject reported that he had arrived in the U. S. 'by boat 5. Nov.

and was planning to leave that afternoon by plane for Washington.

A room was

booked at the Washington Hotel in anticipation of A-T's arrival that evening.

At approximately 1800 hours, A-T called Mr. Pekich on the agent phone from the

Vashington airport to announce his arrival and was directed to go to the hotel,

there subject was subsequently contacted by tir. Pekich and the undersigned.

in a highly emotional state which partly stems iron his recent escape iron

Cuca. In his initial emotional outburst, A-T stated that ve had not lived up

to our cormitments to support his activities in luoa; that he didn't like the

idea of considering himself as being expendable; that he was not sure why we

sent him to Cuba in the first place if we had no intentions to support his

peter that he vee doriate a orcaping in thout losing has life. con-

Alter Mr. Pelich succeeded in quieting don A-T following this intial

outburst, A-7 was first asked to describe how he managed to get out of Cuba

without utilizing our channels to effect this exfiltration.

Efforts to debrief A-7 on his operational activities in Cuba were

sonewhat futile in this initial meeting in view of his unsettled emotiona)

state. His primary concern appeared to be his wife and his rather strained

relationship with his in-laws, who were now residing in Miami.

In this con-

nection, it should be pointed out that this emotional state appeared to sten,

In part, from his inherent suspicions that his wife (21 years of age and rel-

atively attractive) was being unfaithful to him. All Indications are, however,

that A-T has no real basis for these suspicions; other than those conjured up

In any case, he requested i1 it might not be possible to wire-

tap his wife's house in Miami, so that he could have daily reports on her activi-

ties. While no promises were made, A-T was assured we would attempt to l00k

Into this possibility, once we had more definite information that there vere

some grounds for his suspicions.

Office revealed that a wire-tap of A-T's house was a major project in itself

and impossible to accomplish at this time without tieing up considerable

personnel.) A-T was later told this after we assured him that his suspicions

were groundless where his wife was concerned.

5. Following this initial meeting with A-7, it was apparent to both

ir. Pekich and the undersigned that: time would be needed to restore agent's

confidence in our capability to support his efforts in any future projected

assigment in the field. Moreover, A-7's emotional state, which aypears to

stem from his problems with his in-laws and his concern about leaving his wife

alone, wust be fully resolved before attempting to dispatch him again.

6.. In later debriefing session held from 8 to 15 November with A-7,

considerable more light was thrown on the nature and scope of his operational

activities in Cuba.

As previously indicated in paragraph 1 of this report,

A-7's activities are sumarized as follows:

AMPANIC-7 Operational Activities in Cuba:

In line with his projected mission to organize resistance groups

in Havana and Pinar del Rio for mounting sabotage operations against

key target installations and assasination of prominent Cuban Communist

members in the Castro entouraze, A-T appears to have made some progress

in this direction from the time he arrived in Cuba in early August 1960

to his subsequent exfiltration 5 November. Upon arrival in Havana,

A-7 began a series of meetings with leaders of the OA, Triple-A and MDC

with a view to establishing some degree of rapport in the furtherance

of his own personal objectives.. It is significant to note that. ir

himself out too thin in this respect and that in many cases he should

have employed cut-outs instead of attempting to contact certain

individuals himself. Individual meetings were also held by A-7 with

AMPANIC - 5,

and MRUNG-1 with a view to establishing

some degree of rapport and coordination of activities in the area.

In this connection, A-? claims he turned over a number of his assets

over to ANPANIC-5, prior to his movement to the ESCAMBRAY, where he

was subsequently picked up by G-2.

b. Internal Assets Developed in Cuba for Future Operational Use:

In attempting to sift out specific assets developed by A-T during

his activities in Havana, three of the more prominent individuals with

whom A- wes in direct contect should be listed.

and Oriente provinces, location of safehouses in Havana and

which A-7 anticipated would be dispatched to him.

and was planning to use them in a guerrilla action against Castro

forces in the Pinar del Rio area. Moreover, once proper materiel

support in the form of arms and other military equipment vas made

available to him by A-7, be felt he could marshal over a thousand

men in this area.

(5) Finelly, ANPUG-1 who was trained in sabotage techniques in the

U.S. and was later assigned to 1-7, was listed by A-7 as an asset, .

were at considerable odds on certain aspects of conducting operatioi

in Havana, but felt he could resolve these differences upon

his om return.

Problems Encountered by A-7 while Operating In Cuba:

Some of the more significant problens encountered by A-7

during the course of his operations in Havana are as follows:

Security: In this connection, A-T stated that despite

the disguise given him, he had to be constantly on the alert

from the danger of being picked up by G-2 or Castro police

during the course of his numerous operational contacts.

sited several examples there he believed he was under sur

veillance by the opposition and subseguently succeeded In allud-

ing this surveillance.

He complained that his disguise, (hair-

piece and mustache) rapidly deteriorated in the Havana Climate

and as a consequence he was forced to abandon this disguise towe.

the latter part of his stay in Havana. Similarly, he was forced

to change his quarters continually, by moving from one safehouse

to another as a security precaution, since he felt that it was

generally known in Cuban circles that he was operating in the

Havana area, and that he was probably already under the sur-

vellance of castro. security Iorces.

(2) Materiel Support: In the course of these debriefing

sessions, one of A-7's chief complaints was thet

despite his

urgent messages sent through his cut-out (AIRE 1) to the Statio

that arms and otber military equipment were Sorely needed by'

his groups in Havana and Pinar del Rio, no action was taken to

Implement his requests. As a result, A-? felt he was losing fac

with his followers and this was one of the primary factors for

returning to the States to discuss this aspect with Headquarters

(3) Need for Direct Commmication: A-7 stated that without the

services of a W/T operator who could be in direct communication

with us, he is fully convinced that any subsequent return to Cuc

in an operational capacity would be ineffectual. Hence, this

would be one of the conditions laid on us-that when he returned,

a W/I operator would be assigned to him personally.

Projected Future Assignment of A-7 in Cuba: Predicated on the assur

tion that A-T will be sent back to Cuba in the relatively near future, botin

Mssrs. Pekich and Petore feel that his most significant contribution can be

with A-T despite their differences in how these operations should be conducte

choice in taking over the operations in this area against Castro targets.

In any case, a decision has been reached that AT should not be dispatched

without a trained W/T operator who can be relied on to work closely on

operations with A-7 inside the country.

Case Officer Comments: Despite A-f's tendencies to operate on

a grandiose scale, his disappointment in the lack of support received on his

initial mission to Cuba; and his display of enotional instability at times,

it is believed that his efforts can be properly channeled to work effectively

for us In Cuba..

His motivation appears to stem from his personal ambitions

to make his mark on this counter-revolution against Castro, where he can

assure himself of a priminent position in the luture government to be formed

in Cuba after the overthrow of the Castro regime. A-7 has imagination and

the will to succeed. His weakness is his inability to hide his personal

ambitions fron others who may work with him and who may have altogether dif

ferent motivations and sense of values. Hence, it is believed that A-?

will encounter problems in handling pedle recruited or assigned to him in

the course of his activities inside the country.

AMPUG-I can be sited as

a good example, where a clash of personalities has apparently already taken

place.

In view of this, A-T will have to be dealt with firmly and must be

convinced that the success or failure of his projected mission will depend

on his ability to develop confidence and loyalty among his followers once hè

is inside the country again.

Similarly, A-T must resolve his personal proble

dealing with his wife and In-laws, which has had an adverse effect on him

personally since his return, and may affect his operations inside Cuba. The

next several weeks will, therefore, need be devoted to re-establish A-7's

confidence in our ability to support his efforts in Cuba, once he is sent

back, and working out his family problems to obviate any adverse psycholo-

gical effect which may be detrimental to his operations in Cuba..

JOFIN.
