COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

As you are aware, the President on 4 January 1975

established a Commission on CIA Activities Within the:

United States to look into allegations that certain Agency

activities conducted within this country exceeded our charter

and statutory authority.

Upon completion of its inquiry, the Commission will

issue its findings and submit recommendations to the President

and to the Director of Central Intelligence.

The President has directed that the Agency extend support

and assistance to the Commission, and I have pledged my coopera-

tion to the Commission and its Staff.

I have also told: the Commission that any current employee

of the Agency is available to the Commission and its Staff for

discussions.

The Agency and the Commission Staff have now developed

sufficient working experience so that we can design additional

procedures to facilitate the Staff's work in examining topics

of concern.

All members of the Commission Staff have received security

clearances and have been given badges providing them with access

to Agency offices in the Washington, D. C. area.

The Commission Staff will, during their inquiries in CIA

related to she commission time espect mee

s fields of responsibility. The

use of specific sensitive data from these files in any unclas-

sified report by the Commission will be subject to consultation

between the Director and the Commission.

To facilitate interviews by the Commission Staff Officers

with CIA employees, I have advised the Commission that employees

are authorized to furnish classified information with certain

exceptions.

My letter to the Vice President, the Chairman of

the Commission, is attached.

It sets forth guidelines for the

furnishing of classified information.

The cooperative spirit of our relationship with the

Commission and

its Staff must at the same time take. account

of the rights of Agency employees. Like other citizens,

they have the right to remain silent. The Commission Staff

will advise employees of their rights at the beginning of

any interview or other appearance.

My own belief, after careful review of all activities

in question, is that legal action will not be taken against

individuals.

The final decision, however, must rest with

the Department of Justice and other legal authorities and

risk of such

action is a judgment each employee must make

for himself.

When a current Agency employee is asked to be inter-

viewed by a member of the Commission Staff, the Staff member

may notify Mr. E. H. Knoche who is my assistant in charge of

liaison with the Commission and its Staff. Mr. Knoche, in

turn, will notify the employee.

The purpose of this is in

no way to inhibit the work of Staff members.

It is intended

to allow time for the employee to gain general legal guidance

if he wants it, and to obtain security guidance from

an

appropriate senior officer.

There is no requirement that an employee report to his

supervisor or other Agency authorities on the nature of the

interview. This is a matter of the employee's choice.

need to avoid the appearance as well as the fact of collusion

between Agency and employee.

None of us has any intention

to fabricate or mislead.

I am convinced that being forth-

coming will vindicate the Agency and its eminent service to

our country.

In keeping with long-standing policy, employees with

any knowledge of activities conducted within the United States,

now or in the past, which they believe to be of a questionable

nature can follow the customary practice within the Agency of

calling the matter to my

attention or that of the Inspector

General®

This will permit me

to take appropriate policy

actions

with regard to any such activities.

It will also

ensure my ability to continue to be forthcoming with all those

involved in external reviews of Agency activities.

Employees should also feel free to bring any such

matters directly to the attention of the Commission or

en hould also

the Commission Staff outside of Agency channels if they

so desire.

In doing so,

however, employees should bear

in mind that the Commission's field of interest is CIA

activities within this country.

To contact the Commission, employees can call the

Executive Director, Mr. David W. Belin on 456-7010, or the

Counsel, Mr. Marvin Gray, Jr., on 456-7014. The mail

The Honorable Nelson A. Rockefeller

Chairman; Commission on CIA Activities

Within the United States

712 Jackson Place, N. W.

Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. Vice President:

As you are aware, all employees of the Central Intelligence

Agency are required to sign secrecy agreements when they enter on

duty. This is a condition of employment, and it requires that they

keep forever secret all classified information gained during the

course of their employment. The secrecy agreement further re-

quires that they may not disclose classified information in inter-

views or by publication without prior authorization from the Director

of Central Intelligence. There is a provision in the secrecy agree-

ment that the conditions and obligations with respect to the protection

of classified information by the agreement continue after employment

with the Agency has been terminated.

As I have stated to the Commission, I will make available any

employee of this Agency to the Commission for staff interview and

for testimony before the Commission. This letter will serve as

authorization for any such employees or ex-employees to furnish

information as requested by the Commission or its staff on matters

that may be classified. As has been discussed with the Commission,

there are certain sensitive items which should receive special han-

dling. Such items include names of sources, specific details of

technical devices and systems maintained in compartmented channels

by the Agency, names of employees, names of persons who may be

targets of kidnapping or assassination by foreign intelligence organi-

zations, names of organizations cooperating with the Agency, and

detailed information which would pinpoint any of the above. Some

information might also conflict with a subject's right of privacy.

1.0

---

## Page 10

13-00000

-2-

There is no purpose here to impede in any way the Commission's

investigation. I believe, however, in most cases these specific

identifying names and details are not necessary for an understanding

of our activities. Where the Commission or the staff believes that

specific identification is necessary to the purpose of the testimony

or the staff interrogation, the matter will be discussed between the

Commission and the Agency, and I will be prepared to consult with

you and the Commission to determine the course of action to be taken.

Where in the judgment of the employee a specific identification is

especially sensitive as outlined in this paragraph, an identity number

will be assigned pending resolution of the matter between the Com-

mission and the Agency, and in the meantime the identity will not be

divulged by the employee.

I appreciate the cooperation of the Commission and of Agency

employees in this regard. I am still responsible under the statute

and as a professional for the protection of intelligence sources and

methods from unauthorized disclosure. In many situations the inad-

vertent disclosure of a name or identification could have serious

repercussions, including placing lives in jeopardy, and I cannot in

good conscience put such information at risk.

This arrangement of course does not affect the Commission's

procedures for advising prospective witnesses of their rights, secur-

ing waivers, nor the employee's or ex-employee's right not to answer

certain questions if they are concerned that the answers might tend

to incriminate them.

Respectiully,

Colby

Director
