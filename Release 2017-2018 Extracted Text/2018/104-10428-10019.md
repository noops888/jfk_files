ATT A.

29 SEP 1976

MENORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM

: Robert W. Gambino

Director of Security

VIA

:. Acting Deputy Director for Administration

SUBJECT

: Probable Compromise of Information Furnished

to the House Select Committee on Intelligence

1.

Action Requested: Your approval is requested to

assemble an Agency-wide task force to conduct an overall

and/or information

previously furnished by the Agency to the now defunct House

2.

Basic Data: I have been

concerned

for some time with

respect to the improper manner in

which classified information

supplied to the MISC by the Executive Branch was handled from a

security standpoint and which culminated in the leak of the

HSC'5

draft report

to Daniel Schorr.

As you know, leaks of

classified information to

the news media by the HSC began

shortly after its creation and continued throughout the life

of that Committee.

In addition to the news leaks, there have been several

allegations (both substantiated and unsubstantiated) concerning

classified Agency and Intelligence Community documents which

have found their way from the HSC into the hands of unauthorized

persons.

Two of these allegations have been referred to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and in at lcast one

instance (the classified Agency documents

found on the West

Coast by R&D Associates) the FBI is conducting an active investi-

gation.

The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct

inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the leak of the

HSC's draft report to Daniel Schorr generated substantial

testimony by former members and staff of the HSC regarding the

CONRDENTIAL

degree of protection afforded to classified Executive Branch

information by the HSC Staff.

This testimony clcarly demon -

strated that the MISC Staff failed to provido adequate storage

and control over classified documents, to include little or

no control over the copies made or access to classified

material.

Further, the magnitude of this

situation cannot be

determined through

an inventory

of the sealed cartons stored

at the Agency attendant to the "missing documents" allegation,

since there is no way of knowing how many copies

have been

made of these documents nor to whom any such copies may have

been provided.

In view of the inadequate security practices employed

by the HSC Staff, it would seem to be a fair assumption that

much, if not all, of the classified information provided to

them

by the Executive Branch has been compromised.

The allega-

tions and disclosures related to the documents and information

provided ta

provided to the Is continue to surface at regular intervals,

and with each such occurrence the Agency is required to react

and prepare a damage assessment on a case-by-case basis.

I feel strongly that the Agency, and perhaps the entire

Intelligence Community,

should initiate an overall review of

the classified information provided to the HSC with a view

towards preparing a comprehensive damage assessment. Admittedly,

this is

an overwhelming task.

It could, however, be reduced

somewhat by limiting our review to that classified data supplied

to the HSC the disclosure of which would compromise sensitive

Agency sources and/or current Agency projects or operations.

The above review could best be accomplished through

the creation

of a task force comprised of representatives from

all Agency directorates and preterably of those individuals who

were previously involved in preparing Agency information for

transmittal to the MISC.

cept intact, it would be possible to determine precisely what

classified

Agency information was provided to the ISC.

community standpoint

community Staff initiate a similasted that the Intelligence

review by all other Executive

Branch agencies which provided sensitive and classified infor-

mation to the HSC.

The resulting study would be of value in terms of our

commitment to protect the identity and safety of Agency sources

and in our future assessments of various programs

and projects

In short, the

information.

Recommendation: It is recommended that you approve

the creation of a task force, chaired by the Office of Security,

comprised of representatives

from all Agency directorates to

damage assessment of the classified information and/or

documents provided to the now defunct House Select Committee on

Intelligence.
