Assassination of President Kennedy

: b. New York Daily News Article, dated
20 September 1977

1. Reference: <A ZRWAHOO intelligence report, mentioned
that the Minister Counsellor (MC) of the Cuban Embassy in
Kingston, Jamaica addressed the regular monthly meeting of the
Communist Party of Cuba members assigned to Jamaica on 24 Sep-
tember 1977. The MC said, among other things, that Cuban exiles
such as FNU DIAZ LAN and others had been. involved in the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The MC did not
further elaborate.

2. Latin America Division believes that the basis for
the MC's statement was, probably, an article which appeared in
the New York Daily News on 20 September 1977. This article,
which is attached, quoted Maritza LORENZ as saying she, Orlando
BOSCH, Frank STURGIS, Pedro DIAZ Lanz, two unnamed Cuban exile
brothers and Lee Harvey OSWALD formed an assassination squad

je

which went to Dallas to assassinate President Kennedy. We know
of no information in Agency files to substantiate that state-
ment.
