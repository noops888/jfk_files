1. Definitions

(a) Strategic Delivery Vehicles SDV)

The problem in defining an SDV is one of determining the

importance of the distance between the delivery vehicle and the target.

In an exchange between forces located in the US and forces located in

the USSR a strategic missile is simply defined as one capable of making

the trip. While range is still the important factor in defining strategic

aircraft it is not a complete description due to the increasing capability

of fighter aircraft. Strategic aircraft are more precisely described

in terms of weight.

The definition problem becomes acute as the distance between

nations is reduced. In Europe, for example, tactical missiles which

reach more than 60 kms beyond the immediate line of battle can frequently

perform a strategic role. Tactical aircraft (certainly US tactical

aircraft) are readily adaptable to the strategic role in Europe.

Granting that the definition is arbitrary, we have defined

strategic aircraft in this paper by a weight (20,000 kilograms) so as

to include all current US and USSR medium and heavy bombers. Likewise,

strategic missiles have been defined by range 100 kilometers for sea-

based missiles and 1000 kilometers for land-based missiles/ so as to

include all current Soviet missiles capable of striking US forces in

West Germany from Soviet soil.
