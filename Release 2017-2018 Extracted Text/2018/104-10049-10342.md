SUBJECT re Material ‘for possible Use in Discussion with Mr. Pawley

1. ‘The Sissies ere excerpts from a memorandum of conversation between
‘Thomas J. Flores and Jack Gillespie, dated 16 Deceuber 1959:

Francisco G, CAJIGAS told GILLESPIE on 15 Decenber that Willian
PAWLEY was back in Washington; that Generalissimo TRUJILLO had told
him (CAJTGAS) that PAWLEY had promised that he would have information
on the U, 8. official position on the Cuban matter within three days;
thet on important person from the Dominican Republic would
United States on 15 December to meet with PAWLEY on 15 to ee
and that he (TRUJILLO) would hold the PEDRAZA forces until the United
; States" position was mown. On 16 December GILLESPIE said that he
had received a call from Emilio NUNEZ Portuondo the night before and
NUNEZ said he had just seen PAWLEY, after the latter had dined with
Vice President NIXON. ‘According to NUNEZ, PAWLEY claimed that he
was to meet with the DCI“at 0900 on 16 December. NUNEZ also said
‘that TRUJILLO would not allow the revolutionary army to leave the
Doninican Republic without the approval of the United States Goverment.

Comient: NUNEZ, CAJIGAS, and GILLESPIE are mown to dislike
and/or distrust PALEY. -PAWEEY's recent break with NUNEZ is well
Known." CAJIGAS says ‘he fears and dislikes PAWLEY because of some
earlier transactions in Cuba 4m which both were involved; he fears
PAWLEY's support of TRUJILLO which might involve some future comit-
nents; and considers PAWLEY "a meddler" who does more harm than good

to the Cuban cause. GILLESPIE has expressed personal distrust of ~
PAWLEY and said he had discussed PAWLEY with H. Graham Morison, former
Assistant Attorney General now a prominent Washington attorney; MORISON
spoke adversely of PAWLEY, whom he characterized as a great opportunist.
GILLESPIE considers CAJIGAS a "great gentleman” and has urged that
someone in CIA talk to him. Bernard REICHHARD? is also favorably
impressed by CAJIGAS and has described him as one of the most objective
and responsible Cubans he has talked to in Miami.

2, Recently the FBI reported (the DBF is being circulated and is not
readily available) that PAWLEY had been meeting with several Cuban exiles at the
.Mayflower Hotel and on leaving the meeting he told them he was going to meet
“with Allen Dulles and Richard Nixon. Coument: This DBF also said that
PAWLEY had been known to compare TRUJILLO with Abraham Lincoln.
