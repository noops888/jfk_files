1. i

(201-357-029). born 21 April 1923 at|Gonaives, Haiti, who : 4

is President and General Manager of|'the Commercial Dank of :

Haiti, in RID or at the WH/Haitian Desk. In March 1963,

Biographics Register prepared a summary of information on

Mr. CHARLES for inclusion in the Biographic Intelligence

Report on Haitian Opposition Personalities. ‘This suemary !

is made up of information obtained from several different i

sources. One source classif: CHARLES as aislippery i AI

him as a “promoter rather than a wusinessman, who endeavers

to attract United States “venture" ‘capital for various

Haitian projects and then becomes a partner by virtue of

the promotion. Biographics Register has a very high opinion

ef this Source, who is the State Department's Haiti Desk — i

Officer, During a debriefirs on CHARLES, in’ February 1963,

this same source stated that CHARLES /ie a confidant of

President Duva.ier and that he hasjemerged as an active

[cae pridern by virtue of his priviledged position with the
wBident. ay “ }

& Gx i

@, Another source of information regarding CHARLES' -
pusiness interests,is the President .of the National Bank of
Haiti who considers CHARLES, hinselZ, dish For
example, according’ to Source, CHARLES
$14,000.00 on his daughter's signature alone
Commercial Bank of Haiti held a worthi

‘wager sn wine” “ying > agai.


yf notes guaratteed by’political figures. This Source
‘also stated that’ CHARLES was “something of a favorite of
the President, who gave him support.” i

3, Attach to this memorandum is‘a copy of Department
of State Airgram No. A-325, dated 16 February 1963, from
the United States Embassy, Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, subject:
Banking: Balance Sheet of the Banque (Commerciale d'Haiti
which includes some information on CHAT re story. You
will note the comment in the last paragraph of Airgra A-325,
that reads, ". . . Be all that as it may, the Embassy has no ~
strongly adverse information concerning ‘Mr. Charles' integri-
ty or banking honesty.. And as the balance sheet shows, his
bank, if not thriving,’ is at least still a going concern.

: {
4. It mayibe that a check.with 00/C through Mr,
Schreyer's office anda request for field station traces will
provide additional information concerning CHARLES. A copy of
this memorandum, is being forwarded to RID with a request
for a 201 file;on Subject which will be. forwarded to you on

Joseph Chazles had left Haiti six days earlier and had Just arrived
in fie York. A fricnd of Charles, namel Jozeph Dryer, 10) Lakewood

‘hat che had alerted Col, Sam Kail in Ninul to ‘contact Dryer in

2. On 1 May 63 Mrs. Mntlack advised that Charles wns staying at
the Pork Sheraton Wotel, New York, and thnt he had telephoned her
since her nane had been supplied to him by Dryer. Charles considered
her to be his point of contact in Washington. According to Mrs. Matlack,
Charles had appointments to gee Vice President Jolinaon, Senator Keating,
and Congressman Rogers (Florida). Mowever, Charles vas willing to talk
to representatives of Mrs. Matlack's office. Mrs. Matlack stnted that
the Ibedtinn Desk man in ACSI was ready to go to New York to talk to
Charles and invited CIA to accompany him, Charlec speaks very little
English and a fluency in French was therefore required for the inter-
view. Mrs. Matlack stated that she might beable to obtain a French
Lingulot from Firct Ary, Governor's Island, but he would not be an
intelligence officer. It was decided’ that James Balog, New York

Office, who has a knowledge of the French Innguage would accompany
the ACSI Tone a It wuc alco arranged that

Balog would meet the A sentative (Captain Rogers) at the Park
Sheraton Hotel where Charles was staying.

3. On 2 May 63 Mra. Matlack reported that Col. Kail had interviewed
Mr. Dryer in West Palm Beach. Dryer had appointed Charles as Director
of his benk in Haiti. Charles, according to Dryer, formerly had no
political ambitions but in view of the current political situation in
Raiti, Charles now thinks that he may some day bs precident.- Dryer
deceribed Charles as well-connected, politically and finnncially, on
both sides of the fence in Hniti. He 1e also a good friend of President
Duvalier., Dryer hod given Charles letters of introduction to Senator
Keating andt other officials in Washington. Charles wanted to see
President Kennedy and indeed had gone to the White louse to arrange

geologist naned de Mohrencchildt. dé Nohrense
with Charles in a business venture in Haiti ané is trying to arrange
a necting for Charles with Vice resident Johnsoa.

5. On 3 May 63 Jim Balog telephoned to advise that he had had a
five-hour session the previous day with Charles and that he had
obtainel both personality data and views by Charles on what the
United States should do in the current dattian situation. Balog
advised that he vas transmitting the informsticn to Washington.
Upon arrival, copies of the teletypes vere transmitted to ACSI
(tire, Matlack), WH Division, and the Latin America Branch.

6. On 6 Moy 63 Moyo Stumtz, Support Branch, advieed that WH
Division wished to speak to Charles and Balog was esked to arrange
an appointment. Mrs. Matinck telephoned at approximately 1715 to
advise that she had juct reeeived a telephcne call from Mrs.
Mohrenschildt asking assistance in obtaining hotel reservations in
Washinston. Upon being told that we had no special means of obtain-
ing reservations, Mrs. Matlack stated that che would check with the
State Department Protocol Office to determine which hotels would
admit negro guests. Mrs. Natinck finally made recervations at the
Alban Towers. A check with Jin Balog revealea that he had arranged
for Charles to meet the Wil representative in the lobby of the Willard
Hotel, Washington, D. C., at 19:00 noon on 7 Imy. Attempts to reach
Mrs. Matlack that afternoon were unsuccenaful. At 0830, 7 May, @
call was made to Mrs. Matlock te confirm that Charles would be in
Washington on that day ond that arrangements had been made for a
meeting with an Agency reprenentative for 12:00 noon. Mrs. Matlack
retorted that both Mrs. de Mohrenschildt and Charles had called her
that previous evening to confirm a 12:00 luncheon appointment with
her. Mrs. Matlack vas concerned that CIA and Anay should not be
working at cross purposes. ‘he had received authorization from
ACSI to meet Charles at lunch end felt that it would not be politic
for her to withdrn from her appointment since Aray considered her
the point of coatace with Charles, Mayo Stunt: informed Wl Division
of the conflict and passed on the ougrection that the WH Division
reprecentative migit meet Charlen and Mra. Mattack at noon and that
Mrs, Matlack offered to vithirew chortly thereafter, The i repre-

_ sentative declined the offer and requested thot o mecting later in

flicting instructions, she had been placed in the middle in the

9. In the course of the luncheon conversation, Charles had
mentioned to Mra. Matluck that he desired to cet a Mr. Wise, AID, to
discuss US aid to Haiti, Later that afternoon Mrs. Matlack called to
state that che had callol the State Department to pass along Charles*
request. Mr, Zayjovokt (State) had called her back to pass on the
Haitian Desk man's extvene dicplessure that anyone in the United States
Government choull be in official contact with Charles, The desk man
considered Charles to be close to Lhe Duvalier Government, to have
been involved in sevarul shady financial Jealinzs, ond in general, to
‘be an undesimble chumeter, Mra. Matlack asked whether the Agency

had any intereat in Charles which would dictate further contact with
Charles.

10, Mayo Stuntz checked with WI Division and determined that as
@ reeult of the mogling with Charies, the DD/P Uaitian Deck had no
further plans to contnct him, I told Mrs, Matlack that our interest
seemed to have been outiefied and that I believed we should disengage
ourselves as gracefully o6 possible.
