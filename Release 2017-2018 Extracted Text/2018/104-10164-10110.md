There are no traces on Clemard Joseph CHARLE

(201-357-029) born 21 April 1923 at Gonaves, Haits, who

1s President and General Manager ofi the Connorcial Dank of

Haiti, In RID or at the wH/Haitian Desk. In March 1963,

Blographics Register prepared a summary of information on

Mr. CHARLES for Inclusion in the Blographic Intelligence

Report on Haitian Opposition Personalities. This summary

1e made up of information obtained fron several different

sources.

One source classifies CHARLES as a slippery

character who is active on the Hastian scene jand refers to

him as a

"promoter" rather than a lusinessman, who endeavers

to attract United States "venture"/capital for various

Amitian protecte and then becomes a partner by virtue of

the promotion.

Biographica Regiater has a very high opinion

of this Source, who

1s the State Department's Haiti Desk

officer.

During a debriefing on CHARLES, In February 1963,

this same source stated tha: CHARLES is a confidant of

President Duvailer and that he has emerged an an aetive

businessman by virtue of his priviledged position with the

President.

a.

Another source of information renarding CHARLES'

business interests, is the President of the National Bank of

Initi who considers CHARLES, himself, se dishonest.

For

according to Source, CHARLES approved a loan o

014,000.00 on his daughter's mignature alone.
