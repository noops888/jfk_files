Documentation of Castro Assassination Plots

Review Staff 75/1696

1. Per referent request, we have conducted

a review of our

filos on incidents and individuals mentioned in the report given

by Fidol Castro to Senator McGovern.

This memorandun contains

the results of our traces on the alleged assassination plots and

the Cuban individuals mentioned in the report.. It must be borne

in mind that our files are keyed primarily to names of individuals

and not by incidents of plots, thereby making the retrieval process

difficult.

No project file bearing specifically on the subject of

assassination has been located.

Nonetheless, what follows is keyed

to tho

chronological order of the plots as described in Castro's

report.

A.. Mid 1960.

Nothing has been located in records which

ties CIA

to this incident.

(1) Armando CUBRIA Ramos. According to CIA traces,

CUBRIA was a long-timo sabotage expert and member of Castro's 26th

of July Movement until 1960, when he apparently turned on Castro.

He was arrested in 1960 for organizing underground activity

against the Castro regime and was sentenced to 30 years imprison-

ment for conspiracy. There is no record of CIA contact with CUBRIA.

(2) .

Mario TAULER Sague.

He was arrested on 12 July

1960 In Havana where he was caught unloading arms clandestinely

introduced into Cuba.

There is no record of clA contact with him.

At that time he claimed to be in contact with anti-Castro

groups in Cuba and stated that he wanted to assassinate

Castro. He indicated his intention to return to Cuba Immediately.

We dropped contact with him at that time and never did have an
