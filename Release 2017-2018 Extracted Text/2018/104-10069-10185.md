INTRODUCTION.

As a follow up to reference, laj. Hatlington

arrived in Miami on 6

June 1962.

After Maj. Watlington had an op-

portunity to discuss the local situation with Lt. Col. Carlos Causes

the local ACSI representative, arrangerents vere made

for a lengthy

cession on the subject of Agreed Activities.

It vag agreed that

discussion would

take place at 1000 hours on 7 June 1962 at a

JIWAVE safehouse facility.

This meeting subsequently took place as

scheduled and was participated in by Lt. Col. Causes, Haj. Vatlington,

Dudley R. JENTONS, Charles B. WIESINGER and Andrew K. REUTELAN.

The specific points which were outlined in this discussion are

covered in the following paragraph.

DISCUSSIONS.

In the course of the 7 June 1963, conversations

with ACSI representatives the following topics worthy of recording

were discussed.

Opa Locita Refugee Referral Procedures.

Maj.

Watlington nade the point that in accordance with the

agrectents which had been reached between ACSI and

KUBAR,

local procedures were to be agreed upon in

order that ACSI might obtain refugee referrals fron

Opa Locka which could be used as a basis upon which to

mount OB collection operations.

Maj. Watlington under-

scored the point that ACSI had no interest or charter

to run other than OB collection operations.

At the

case time if any of their operations produced intelli-

Gence on subject matter other than OB,

this intelligence

would be reported via existing ACSI reports channels.

REUTELAN indicated that JIVAVE

acknowledged the validity

of ACSI's mission in the OB field, and ve were therefore

that we could minimize the posalbilities for duplication

• of offort and/or wiro crossing.

This concopt was readily

accoptod by Haj. Wattington.

It did not, however, strike

a totally responsive chord in Lt. Col. Causes.

This was

noted but in ordor to proccod with preliminary arrange

monts, REUTGNAN put forth the proposal that ACsi register

alist of dront requirements with Opa Locke and that this

•list could then be used as a basis upon which refugee

screenings could be conducted.

It was suggested that Col.

Kail would be the logical

point of reference in Opa Locka

through which the referral system could be managed. In

"this connection it was pointed out that once Col. Kail

identified an individual whom he considered to be pri-

marily of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi

vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. Causes' covert unit.

At the same time Col. Kail would make arrangements to pass

to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station

JMWAVE a copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual

Upon receipt of this in-

formation KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and at

Station JUVAVE would review the referral.

If this review

revealed that the individual was not of

operational

interest to JIWAVE and his primary access was not in fields

other than OB,

no objections would be expressed relative

to ACSI retention and full exploitation of the body.

Vatlington expressed satisfaction with this proposal and

Lt. Col.

Causes asked If we could clarify the current status of

our relationship with Cuesta.

As this name did not ring

a ball with any of the JIAVE representatives, Li. Col.

Causes was asked for further details.

This produced the

ntatonent that ACSI was interested in Cuesta land vanted

to uso him in an infiltration operation.

ACSI had allegedly

previously traced Cuesta with Station JAVE and had re-

coivod the reply that KUBARis had been in touch with the

Individual but had terminated nim because he was unreliable.

In view of this responge Lt.. Col. Causes wanted to know

whether we would recommend the reuse of Cuesta by ACSI.

Wo responded to this by stating that we would review our

files and would forward a written reply to Lt. Col. Causes

Col. Causos stated that he felt that ho had

Despite this,

he had found that

Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there-

ACSI representatives whether they were currently in

were inherent in the use of third country diplomats and

how misuse could affect long standing government to

cussion of those support

Services which KUanK might

render to ACSI operations revealed that It. Col. Causes

was stil interected in having JIWAVE infiltrato ivo of

In this connection the point

was nado by ACSI that under optinum circumstancos they

would profer that jIWAVE assume responsibility. for the

agents in the liani area and then deliver them through

secure mechanion to lavana.

If this were not possible

ACS would reluctantly uccept infiltration of their agents

into any point in PBRUMEN.

Causes was toid in

very precise terns that JIwAVE would not undertare to

infiltrate any of his agents into Ravana.

On the other

hand,

wa vould consider any proposal for the infiltracion

of selected agents to a beach area in PBRULEN.

The point

understand that our maritime capabilities were linitod

of these assets for at least six weeks in advance.

result any operational plan which be might subait to us

should be koyed to the egsumption that approximately s18

h. ' Coordination Forms.

The discussion of opera-

tiopal coordination revealed that ACSI was willing for

ILWAVE to coordinate locally those operational proposale

which might be received from Lt. Col. Causes.

coordination vas effected and if there were disagreoment,

then the operation could be referred to the Washington

headquarters of both ACSI and JUVAVE.

Maj. Watlington

stated that the forms for effecting coordination in ec-

cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at

Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit

In Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj.

Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination

mechanism until these forms were on hand circa l July 1962.

W/T Assets.

The discussion of the use of W/T

foctlitiee in terms

of PBRUMEN operations revealed that

the Miami ACSI unit

did not have any W/T assets in

PORUMEN at this time.

On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes

was interested in establishing W/T assets in PBRUMEN.

view of Chis he asked if JWAVE would continue to assess,

polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought

wore suitable W/T candidates.

It was indicated that we

vere cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases

and would render whatever support was required.

This then

reculted in a discussion of whether JMWAVE would be willing

to monitor ACSI W/T transmissions from PBRUMEN in those

instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed,

polycraphed or trained by KUBARk.

We indicated that we

would be clad to moniter such transmissions if we were

told in advance of the date, time

and frequencies on which

the broadcasts were to be nade.

this then led to a dis

cussion of whother JWAVE would be willing to tranonit

nossages for ACSt agouts.

we stated that

we would lavorably consider any requests for C/ trans-

missions providing that we knew the content of the nessage,

the identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the

egont's location and oquipment which he might be using.

It. Col. Causes stated

that in view of this discussion

could anticipato

that he would be levying requirenents on

us in the near future for support in the W/T field.

Secrot Writing.

A discussion of S/l tochnigues

revcaled that IT a requost for the issuance of S/l vere

rocoivod fron thoir Miant representative it vould be ro-

viored, and if ACst approved the operation KUBARK woUld

be ashed to issuo a systen.

IN JAVAVE agreed via local

coordination that the oporation in question required the

use of 8/V, then this recommendation would bo cabled to

our Washington Headquarters

where coordination would

effocted with ACSI.

Once this was acconolished, KUBARK

Washington would cable to JHVAVE the number of the system

which wasito be issued.

JWAVE would then issue the

syston to the ACSI representative in liani.

At the conclusiön of the above discussion arrange-

nonts wore made for lunch, but It.

Col. Causes chose not to partici-

nate in the luncheon session.

During the luncheon conversation

aj. Watlington indicated

that he did not believe that It. Col.

Causos would cooperate within the spirit of the DCID's.

As a result

no salod that JIVAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time

as It. Col. Causes retired and could be replaced.

indscatod that the retirement was scheduled to tale place. at the

end of Saptember 1962.

At the end of the luncheon session ai-

tangononts wore made for JENTONS to take Maj. Watlington on a -

tour of Opa Locha.

Based on

this tour additional discussions

toro to be hold with Maj. Waclington particularly in regard to

the development of procedules for referral of agents to ACSI

from the Opa Locka flow.

OPA LOCKA.

Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently

vent out to the interrogation center at Opa Locka.

Here they

had an interview with Col. Kail, the tenor of which was, on the

part of Maj. Watlington,

to assure himself that the ACSI repre-

sentative, Francast, vas having adequate access to operational

Col. Kail said that operational leads were shared ac-

there were occasional difficulties in

that the men best qualified received the body in question.

In addition, he said KUBARK occasionally pulled a man out of the

Center without his completing

the ACSI representative's getting his hands on someone who might

be well qualifled for their operations.

Maj. Watlington belleved

Maj. Watlington said that he would ask

Col. Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of JENIONS

to fornal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do much to

elininate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious

AGREEMENT.

When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to

Lt. Col. Causes after the meeting at Opa Locka,

the two ACSI

representatives said that they believed that,

for the time being,

Le would be better to

continue the system as at present, pending

JENIONS permanent arrival at the beginning of july 1962.

Col. Causes is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was

agreed to as a stopgap measure.
