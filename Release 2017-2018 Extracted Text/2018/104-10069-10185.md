1. INTRODUCTION. As a follow up to reference, Maj, Watlington
arrived in Wiami on 6 June 1962, After Maj. Watlington had an op-
portunity to discuss the local situation with Lt. Col. Carlos Causes »
the local ACSI representative, arrangements were made for a lengthy
session on the subject of Agreed Activities. It was agreed that
this discussion would take piace at 1000 hours on 7 June 1962 at a
JLWAVE safehouse facility. This meeting subsequently took place as
scheduled and was participated in by Lt. Col. Causes, Maj. Watlington,
Dudley R. JERTONS, Charles B,.WIESINGER and Andrew K, REUTEMA)
The specific points which were outlined in this discussion are
covered in the following paragraph.

2. DISCUSSIONS. in the course of the 7 June 1962, conversations
with ACSI representatives the following topics worthy of recording
were discussed.

a, Opa Locka Refugee Referral Precedures. aj.
Watlington made the point that in accordance with the
agrecnents which had been reached between ACSI aud
KUBARX, local procedures were to be agreed upon in
order that ACSI might obtain refugee referrals froa
i Gpa Loci which could be used as a basis upon which to
mount OB collection operations. Maj. Watlington under-
scored the point that ACSI had no interest or charter
to run other than OB collection operations. At the
cane time if any of their operations produced intelli-
gence on subject matter other than OB, this intelligence
“ould be reported via existing ACSI reports channels.
REUTEWAN indiated that JLWAVE,acknowledged the validity
of ACSi's mission in the OB field, and we were therefore
willing to Ayprerate fully in this regard. On the other

oefeguards bo built into any Opa Locka r@ferral in_order
that we could minimize the possibilities for duplication
-of offort and/or wire crossing. This concept was readily
accopted by Haj. Watlington. It did not, however, strike
a totally responsive chord in Lt. Col, Causes, This was
noted but in order to proceed with preliminary arrange-
nents, REUTENAN put forth the proposal that ACSI register
a. hist of ‘igont requirements with Opa Locka and that this
ist could then be used as a basis upon which refugee
screenings could be conducted. It was suggested that Col.
Kail would be the logical point of reference in Opa Locka .
through which the referral system could be managed. In op
7 "this connection it was pointed out that once Col, Kail a
‘ identified an individual whom he considered to ‘be pri- —
marily of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi-
vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. Causes’ covert unit,
At the same time Col, Kail would make arrangements to pass
‘ to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station
i JMWAVE a copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual
who had been referred to ACSI. Upon receipt of this in-
formation KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and at
Station JMWAVE would review the referral, If this review
revealed that the individual was not of operational
we interest to JMWAVE and his primary access was not in fields
other than OB, no objections would be expressed relative
to ACSI retention and full exploitation of the body. Haj.
Watlington expressed satisfaction with this proposal and
“stated that he would be prepared to discuss it further
once he had an opportunity to personally review the func-
tioning oF the Opa snataeettnaescettt - 7 ;

Causes was asked for further details, This produced the
pfatement that ACSI was interested in CucSta ‘and wanted

, In view of this response Lt.. Col. Causes wanted to know
whether we would recommend the reuse of Cuesta by ACSI.
Wo responded te this by stating that we would review our
files and would forward a written reply to Lt. Col. Causes
within the next few days. ;

Lt, Col. Causes stated that he felt that ho had
established his equity in Ordonez through the namo

s trace procedure. Despite this, he had found that
Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there-

fore, he assumed that we were debriefing this man.

e. Third Country Diplomats, REUTEMAN asked the
ACSI representatives Whether they were currently in
touch with any third country diplomats. aj. Watlington

stated thatACS! had_previously tried to harness thep

€apabilities of th

' of these facilities, As a result Maj. Watlington stated

that at th 4 present time ACSI was not in touch with any
third ee On the other hand, ACSI was

interested in pursuing the third country diplomatic
channel gis a medns of establishing communications with
inside dssets. At this point Lt. Col. Causes stated
that he was very disappointed at KUBARK's 4 Si

allow him to use the facilities of the

+ D reaction; however, the KUBARK
positioi was based on sound security principles and
could not be altered. The additional explanations which
were made relative to the security implications which
were inherent in the use of third country diplomats and
how misuse could affect long standing government to
government or service to service agreements between
ODYOXE and free world countrics did not make any impact
on Lt. Gol. Causes. This gentleman was predisposed to

rpret KUBARK's refusal to allow him to use certain
2 channels as a clear indication that -
ne-O1 - a imary responsibilities in the Hiani

Gnce this attitude was identified no further attempts were
made to persuade Lt. Coil. Causes that our actions had
been taken in the best interests of' the intelligenco

community.
f. bk @ ngaltwation of ACSE Agents, A dis-
cussion of those Gupport Services which KUEMK might

ronder to ACSY operations revealed that Lt, Col. Causes
was stiil interested in having JMWAVE infiltrate two of
his agents lato PBRUMEN., Yn this connection the point
was made by ACSY that under optimum circumstances they
would prefer that JMVAVE assume responsibility for the
agents in the IMiami area and then deliver them through a
secure mechanism to Havana, i¥ this were not possible
ACS would reluctantly accept infiltratibn of their agents
into ary point in PORUMEN, Lt. Col. Causes was toid in
very precise terns that JMWAVE would not undertake to
infiltrate any of his agents into Havana, On the other
hand, we would consider any proposal’ for tho infiitrataon
of selected agents to a beach ayea in PBRUMEN, The point
was made that in this connection Lt. Col, Causes had to

| 7 understand that our maritime capabilities were limited
and we were currently committed to the full exploitation
of these assets for at least six weeks in advance. As a
resuit any operational plan which he might subnit to us
should be keyed to the agaumption that approximately six
to eight ‘weeks would paGs before we could realistically
consider the servicing of his request. Lt. Col, Causes

agreed to project his operational plans within this frane
of reference. i

It was indicated that KUGARN under=——

area was to restrict and inhibit ACSI operational activity.

: G. Docunontation. A discussion of the documentation
problom roYative to iigent infiltrations revoaled that at
* the moment: ACSI did not have any.documentation problems
which they felt warranted discussion at this session.

h. ’ Coordination Forms, The discussion of opsra-
tiogal coordination yovealed that ACSI was willing for
JLWAVE to coordinate locally those operational proposals
which might be received from,Lt. Col. Causes. Once this
coordination was effected and if there were disagreoment,
then the operation could be referred to the Washington
headquarters of both ACSI and JMWAVE, Maj. Watlington >
stated that the forms for effecting coordination in ac-
cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at
Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit ie
in Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj. :
Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination
mechanism until these forms were on hand circa 1 July 1962,

i. W/T Assets. The discussion of the use of W/T
facilities in terms of PBRUMEN operations revealed that
the Miami ACSI unit did not have any W/T assets in
PBRUUEN at this time. On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes

view of Ghis he asked if JMWAVE would continue to assess,
polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought
wore suitable W/T candidates, It was indicated that we
were cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases
and would render whatever support was required. This then
resulted in a discussion of whether JKWAVE would be willing
to monitor ACSI W/f transmissions from PBRUMEN in those
instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed,
polygraphed or trained by KUBARK. We indicated that we
would be glad to moniter,such transmissions if we were
told in advance of the date, time aud frequencies on which
the broadcasts were to be mide. This then led to a dis-
cussion of whether JMWAVE would be willing to transmit

C/I nossages for ACSY agouts. Here again, we stated that
we would favorably consider any requests for C/V trans-
missions providing that we knew the content of the message,
the identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the
agent's location aud equipment which he might be using.
Lt. Col. Causes stated that in view of this discussion we
could anticipate that he would be levying requirements on
us in the near future for support in the W/T field.

j. Secret Weiting, A discussion of S/W teéhniques &
revealed Cif WT Yequest for the issuance of S/W were
rocoived from theiy Miaal representative it would be re-
viewod, and if ACST approved the operation KUBARK would
be asked to issue a system. Wf JMWAVE agreed via iecal
coordination that the operation in question required the
use of S/W, then this rocommendation would ba cabled to
our Washington Headquarters where coordination would be
effocted with ACSI. Once this was accomplished, KUBARK

: Washingtgn would cable to JMWAVE the number of the system

which was\to be issued. JLWVAVE would thea issue the
system to the ACSI representative in Miami.

3. COMMENT, At the conclusiéa of the above discussion arrange-
ments wore made for lunch, but Lt. €ol. Causes chose not to partici-
pate in the luncheon session. During -the luncheon conversation
Eaj. Watlington indicated that he did not believe that Lt. Col.
Causes would cooperate within the spirit of the DCID's. As a result
he asked that JEWAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time -
as Lt. Col, Causes retired and could be replaced. Maj. Watlington

&

was" interested in establishing W/T assets in PBRUMEN. In : -

. indicated that the retirement was scheduled to take place. at the
“ end of Saptember 1962. At the end of thé luncheon session ar- : da
Fangeneats were made for JENTONS to take Maj. Watlington on a ~ 7 5
oo of Opa Locka. Based on this tour additional discussions
ore to be held with Maj. Watlington particularly in regard to
the development of proceduves for referral of agents to ACSI
from the Opa Locka flow.

4. OPA LOCKA, Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently :

went out To the Interrogation center at Opa Locka, Here they 2
had an interview with Col. Kail, “the tenor of which was, on the
part of Maj. Watlington, to assure himself that the ACSI repre-
sentative, Francasi, was having adequate access to operational :
leads. Col, Kail said that operational leads were shared ac- :

cording to their abilities between the KUBARK representative and
the, ACSI man. However, there were occasional difficulties in e
assuring that the men best qualified received the body in question.

‘ In addition, he said KUBARK occasionally pulled a man out of the

] Center without his completing the full treatment which precluded 7

the ACSI representative's getting his hands on someone who might ss

be well qualified for their operations. Maj. Watlington believed os

| that assurance that the ACSI representative got a fair deal

] might be achieved through a more complete briefing of Col.

' Trudencio Ulibarri, who is in charge of the preliminary screening

| so that he would more fully understand what was needed, JENTONS -

said that this would be a very good idea, but that it would be

better if it were a dual briefing with a KUBARK representative

| being present as well. Maj. Watlington said that he would ask

: his headquarters for permission to have such a briefing given.

if Coi. Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of JENTONS

i to formal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do much to Hy
| eliwinate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious é
i thought.

S, AGREEMENT, When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to eke
Lt. Col. uses after the meeting at Opa Locka, the two ACSI
representatives said that they believed that, for the time being,
it would be better toAcontinue the system as at present, pending {
JENDONS' permanent arrival at the beginning of July 1962. As Lt.
Col. Causes is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was |
agreed to as a stopgap measure.
