MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Support

1, This memorandum is for your information only. ~ -

2. On the afternoon of 24 April 1967, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation advised this Office of claimed Agency affiliation by a
fugitive witness in the New Orleans investigation into a conspiracy to
assassinate the late-President... According to the FBI information,

“received from a news media source, Gordon Dwane Novel, the

' fugitive witness, had indicated he is currently employed by the CIA
and the alleged burglary of a munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana,
in 1961, involved CIA and was not a burglary. According to Novel,
the Schlumberger Well Service had an arrangement with CIA wherein
it leased a bunker in which ammunition, bomb casings and other
material would be stored for CIA. According to Novel, it was
intended to ship the-material out of the U.S. in Schlumberger boxes
labeled "machinery". Again according to Novel, following the Bay
of Pigs invasion, the Schlumberger interests became upset and
wanted out of their contract with CIA. Three months aiter the
invasion, states Novel, arrangements were made for the material
stored in the bunker to be removed by Novel and his group. At the
time the material was removed, he states, an individual involved
also took some of Schlumberger's low grade powder and fuses and
other material. Novel has reportedly supplied someone with the
names of the othexs involved with thé burglary. He specificially
told the media source that he and one Arcacha Smith are still
employed by CIA and that should he be returned to New Orleans

to face charges of burglary of the bunker, be would offer this as his
defense. :

3. The following day, 25 April, a story in the New Orleans
States Item charged there is mounting evidence of Central Intelli-
gence Agency links in District Attorney Garrison's presidential
assassination conspiracy probe, noting that at least one figure in

the case intends to use his CIA connections as part of his defense

and that “still others linked to the Garrison investigation have been
named as acting for the super-secret espionage organization--as
informers, as couriers and munitions carriers", It named Novel as
having the strongest ties to CIA, and quotes him as calling the alleged

bunker burglary ae “the most patriotic burglary.in history". -He

reportedly has told associates, states the news item, that the alleged
contact, According to Novel, the late David\William Ferri “and Yeu
others were involved in the bunker —— the
explosives were picked up and consolidate ‘Soon after the bunker
incident and eventually taken by boat to Cuba for use ina diversionary
operation in connection with the Bay of Pigs invasion, (This etatement
conflicts with Novel’s reported statement to the FBI's media source,
paragraph one.above, which dates the bunker theft as three months
after the Bay of Pigs. District Attorney Garrison also haa charged
the bunker incident took place three months after the Cuban invasion. )
The newspaper also quotes Novel as contending that he operated the
Evergreen Advertising Agency in New Orleans as a front for CLA
communications in an elaborate use of commercials to alert agents

to the date of the Bay of Pigs invasion,

theft was a war materiale pickup made at the difection of his CIA se,

4. Novel, according to the prese report, has said "I think
Garrison will expose some CIA operations in Louisiana", but did not
elaborate. His attorney, however, would appear to place Hittle faith
in Novel's claims, In a Columbus, Ohio, interview, Jerry Weiner,

. attorney for Nevel, when told of the press reports of Novel's state-

ments, said: "It's utterly ridiculous, - Novel is not now and has never
been a CIA agent."

5, There is no record of any utilization Gordon Dwane Novel,
Sergio V. Arcacha Smith, or the EvergreemAdvertising Agency. (In
addition to Office of Security r: . RID; ane CI Staff
were checked for possible indication of operatipna involvement. }

6. Inquiries with WH/Cuba, the Office of Logistics, and
several Agency officers involved with munitions storage in the New
Orleans area at the time of the Bay of Pigs fail to develop any
indication of past operational activity of the nature described by Novel.
Officers who handled project munitions storage in the area have indi-
cated that all the munitions were stored at a reactivated Naval depot

ole

and completely under Agency control, Munitions in transit were
guarded, and there is no knowledge of utilization of commercial
storage facilities of the Schlumberger interests or any other
commercial firm. (The Office of Logistics has had dealings in the
past with Schlumberger-related firms, but-has avoided activities
with the Schlumberger firm because of its foreign ownership and
questionable personalities in the firm. DCS has had an interest in
the past in some personalities affiliated with Schlumberger, bat
reportedly unrelated to any mattera as alleged by Novel. }

7. As noted above, Novel has claimed to the press that the
xounitions from the bunker were to be usedr a diversionary :
operation at the time of the Bay of Figs, Agency officers familiar
with the operation at the reactivated Naval depot, the Belle Chasse
Ammunition Depot, have indicated that such a diversionary opera-
tion was based at Belle. Chasse, bot.that the operation was. cancelled
before a landing was made, Any number of participating Cubans
would be aware such a diversionary operation was planned.

3. The CI Staff, ina detailed staff study of the Garrison

investigation, has. CIA c ith only two figures named
in the inquiry, Clay Dy Shayw-and Caz! ringuier, in both cases the
contact was lim’ estic ¢ rvice activities, The

study specifically notes there ha¥e been no documented Agency
utilisation of Novel, Ferrie or Arcacha Smith, those named by Novel
in his statements to the press about the bunker incident,

- 9, During the course of our inquiries into Novel's charges,
one tenuous Link was developed which conceivably could be exploited
and distorted in attempts to lihk this Agency with Novel and others.

_An interlinking with a personality seportedly from Ramparts Magazine

might also indicate a connection between Novel's charges and the con-
certed efforts of some to smear the Agency. This situation is
described in an attachment to this memorandum.

NOVEL Is Polygraphed by Lloyd FURR on Garrison's Charges,

Gordon Dwane NOVEL, already a fugitive witness in the
Garrison inquiry, is reported in the Washington press of 27
March 1967 as having been polygraphed the. previous day on the
case under investigation by Garrison. According to the press
reports, NOVEL submitted to a polygraph examination
conducted at MeLean, Virginia by Lloyd FURR. In statements
to the press, FURR indicated there was no indication of
deception to NOVEL's charges that Garrison's case is a

ST’and REGEX.

Lloyd FURR, a former District of Golumbia police: and now
a private detective, is a self-proclaimed polygraph "epert"
and sound device specialist. He has received publicity in the
past for planting sound devices for the late Fulton Lewis, Jr.
in the St, Mary's County vice casa in 1953 and in 1958 when he
discovered Hstening devices being used against Bernard Goldfine.
In 1964, information was received that a Washington, D. C.
firm, REDEX, operated by FURR and Richard L. BAST, was
attempting to sell electronic equipment to Communist China via
an agent in Hong Kong. (TSD had unclassified contact with
FURR in 1962 to see equipment offered for sale by FURR.)

Cc. Richard L, BAST and REDEX.

Richard L. BAST, 2 Washington, D.C. private detective, gained
noteriety in 1965 by turning up a missing witness, previously
unlocated by the Department of Justice, in connection with the
Bobby Baker case, He is known to operate at least four
enterprises: 1) CAPITAL. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, a
private detective agency; icles » a firm
which imports a variety of commodities ranging from liquor to
autemobiles into South Vietnam, including, of late, U.S.-recruited
"go-go" girls for a Saigon nightclub he is nifg; 3) REDEX_

overseas. BAST, described as “ynserupulous and untrust-
worthy", is known to have attempted to contract with another
private detective for planting a rermote-controlled bomb in the
headquarters of the Haiti Secret Police, and has been reported
to have undertaken similar extreme assignments for exile
groups from Haiti and the Dominican Republic. (Based on
derogatory information on file, DCS, in March 1967, decided
against previously contemplated contact with BAST as a
source of information on Asia,

statement by BAST that the following week BAST would be
sendzag a shipload of arms to 2 CASSAGNOL-affiliated group
in the Dominican Repablic. Owen noted: “Raymond
CASSAGNOL gives appearance of thinking well of Richard
BAST. According to CASSAGNOL, his brother, Jacques,

also mows BAST and respects him. Thus BAST, in spite of
certain personal shortcomings from the intelligence standpoint,
does represent an established channel to at least one segment -
of the Haitian opposition to Duvalier. Since according to his
own statement, BAST is supplying arms to CASSAGNOL's
grosps, further transactions of this type via BAST presumably
would not be difficult to arrange. " He also provided g detailed
{nformation on what he learned of BAST, noting that BAST had
mentioned Dominican distrust of State and AID and the fact that
CIA double-crossed them" (the Dominicans).

repozted 16 May 1963 his attendance at dinner at BAST's home
on 27 April 1963. Owen told of his meeting with CASSAGNOL,
BAST's intention to sell arms to the Dominican Republic and
Haitian exiles, etc, He also reports that on 7 May 1963, BAST
asked him to perform some translation work, The translation,
he stated, related to BAST giving a power of attorney to one
Lais MORENO Maztines of the Dominican Republic to prepare
Gocumentation for legal establishment of REDEX CORPORATION,
Cc POR A, a DR branch of BAST's firm, According to Owen,
40% of the stock was to be held by the head of the DR National
Security Agency, the head of the DR secret police, and an
individual well-connected with Dominican Republic police and
intelligence groups. BAST is also noted to have told Owen

of an offer BAST had made to "bug" the office of the Dominican

i



Secretary of State for the Armed Forces on behalf of Juan

Bosch. BAST did not indicate to Owen if had performed
the job.
