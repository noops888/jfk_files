i 2, I bed planned to see RAY on his retcre from Puerto Rico on

diplocatie relations between the Taitad States ani Cuba compelled
we to return tc Eavena on the roraing of 3} Januery 1941,
Consequently. wy nesting vith RAY was postponed mtil last evmaing
vhen an appoistaant ves made through +SSINGER to moot, with hin
_ ~ a& the latter's apertnent.

3. Cur nesting tested aprroxinately three hours - roughly fron 7 to 10 p.m.
ke covered a vide range of subjects, che highlighta of vhioh I
shall try te cover in sucoseding paracrashs,

lia made only passing referezoas to his trip
iso, He rantioned that he hal « very “ins talk with
Gov. 120% Marin-for whan be exprospod great ndniretica, Several
tines during the evening's sasion bo indicted that he would 11ke
to see the future Cuba follow tho path of Muerto Slice end xeat
Germany in its sconois devolojzent. ‘io alen arid that ho had
omnforred with ex-Yreeident of Coata Rica. Dr, Jose ¥:0!
he fowl very prooocuoied with zasreat to future develoze!
‘ Latin Americas tho influenoo which CAS°R still oxarts on the
ninds of great numbers of peorle, RY ooarented that vhile almost all
of the governront now eee C'S7R for vat he 1s. a cyntenl dictator,
there are rony, many people vho still view hin ae 6 porulor losder
who fe trying to help tis people, luck rore in tho propagenta line

In this connection he anid that the iti hores within she next three
weeks or so to copiire bronieasting facilities in Costa Rica,
Yenosuala, and perhaps aoquire a chip fron wich propaganda could
be dissoninated,

5. ATTITUT? TO'ARD THE MNBTE, RAY fools that the Frente has little
to offer the yeople of Cube for the future. For oxe=r'e. he sald,
there is grest discontent in the Cuban Hebe! Army which could be
exploited 1f these dissident olenents could hnyy save assuranos that
they wore Jaying down their lives for « worthwhile esuse, UY
does not fool that the sotion eni compooition of the FRD ing,fros
auch confidence, He aid not mention any name epacifically arong
the FRD widech would represent a “return to the post® bet-he 11d
sey that ono of tho Executive Fenbora (head of a tepartrent, I
believe is how he put it) had been a big tine contractor during
RATISTA's rogime and that vhen RAY took over the Ministry of Fublic
Works under T'reoident UWUTIA, he learned that this same contractor
hed previously presented a bill end collected 300,000 pesos for a
public vorks project vhich was never undortaken, Instead of having the
man jailed, RAY satd that be ae !'inister of Publie Works -erely
insisted that the Job ba done, Ie camented that he (RiT) would
now probably “have to pay for this." I presuce he heant that thie -
particular foraon will eventually eoek sone typeof .parsonsl revenge,
RAY aleo said that “ono of tho five" -exbers of ¥ fided to
him that he is aot happy but there 4s Yittle he oon do sbout it because.
‘he fe thare.® RAY repeated ome of the umiml-oriticims of the FRD:-
“high 1iving.* potty politics, “evoryboiy rocoiving a salery." end the
“obvious fact" that the U.S, Gorornnont is picking up the tab, Tris
he said vas fine vith th because it vas causing ifaf?\ussoned
Cubans vithin an vithout Cuba to turn to the "a? as the only hope
Ne was yulta frank in at-ting that vhile be is willing to “oocperate®
vith tho Fronta, he did not vant the 1% te become identified in the

PRCH.T1S 7B 24:5 OPS, when Itold RAY that ve vere crepared to
provide hin material suprort ani thet v-fle.much of this rateriel
support would have to be delivered by tha Frente xothanisn this would
not nooeaserily nake hin beholden or pace hin under oblirstion to

the Fronte, he exiled ani ssf thet this ts what I say, but this is not
the vay it vorks, Thinking ba vs referring to sore incident in

tho past, end not the immediate present, I sald that I vas sure be
would nov find thet thia tg how it works, Ne then told me thet he

hed boen negotiating for an air drop to a croup in the Bscenbrays,
that Kr, B, tal o-me down end *e thought their difforoness hai been
pretty much resolved, and Hr, 5, had toki hr, QEVI00 that there

had been o moating of nints, et cetera, and with everything all sot
for tho drop, ke is - at tha slevents hour (ke said "three days sgo*)
told that the eras must bear the sticker of the Frente, otherwise

"no arne." Ee said that the vas absolutely uaccoptable to bir,

He said be dia not insist or particularly ask that the erna be
Adontifiod with "RP" ctickers, so therefore he could not see any
Justification for insisting that the arns boar the FHD lubel. Ke

said that hie croup has done cll the operational -planiing for the drop,
couriers have gone back and forth tetveen Eavana and the Ssoasbrars,
apa have bean draw up, DZ's tave ben errengud, and nov ke is

told that the equipment which ha had been told vas baing supp’ fod

to his rroup must bear the Isbs! of the rival "FWD." It 41s obvious
that vhile ve say that ve look urea tho Fronte as a non-political
grouping of various opposition croups, RAY looke uyon the Frente as
the politiesl crgonisation of Tony ¥:3CKA ani I ‘parsonslly do not

fae! canguine that any amount of explanation will change his

thinking in this regard, Mere, ani eleevhers during our eonversst’on,
I noted a certain a.ourt of intreneigence uni lack of toleranes on

the part of RAY which dose rot bode vel! for. the future, unless he
gan be nate to realize that his group and following are not the sole
repository of virtus, honesty, ocmpetenos ani road intentions, RAY

ig on idealist, He drerms of a ienoorctic Cuba, free of corrurtion,
ruled by -en wo are selflessly ‘edio-ted to the promotion of the
goneral velfare, Whan I said to 3a that Tony VARONA and other
Jeadera of the FRD would say that they too stand for thaen things. he
again gailed and said: "The curious thing ig that they Jo not come
out and say unequivocally that they stand -for these things,

Instead they cay ve ars Cubes - ve are not Englishoen, vo are not
Anericans, ve are not Germans - ve are Cubung." ‘What: they rean to. sar,
he vent on is thst selfis*ness, soe corruption. ot cetera, is part
of-the Cuban nake up and thet itis being the oaso it is unrealistic
and impractical to think that Cursns oan dspire to a Jenoaracy

based on intagrity end Mecal honasty such as ve have in the United
States. or England. or other -ore civanoad dsoor'oies of Nestern -
Burope. ife feels that the pescle af Cuba ysara for such a tenocraay
sai they Jo not ees the chances cf Mfitizont 1 the composition of
the Frente, Therefore ho wishes to ecbaty in the ERP those mon vtose

reputations ere clean - he kept referring to Felipe Pasos, as an
exaxple ~ and thus old out to the Cubans 1n Cuba a hope of botter

days to come ~ ani to provilo thom a cause for wick to fight.

Without a will to fight cn the part of tha peonle cf Cuba, he said,

CAS"RO will never be overtirow. ‘Tho will to fight doen not exist

on the scale that is nsoded to achieve eucosss. Tho Frenta is

completely incapable of providing the inspiration fron vi:ich euch

a vill can etem. Consequentely. it 18 up to the TP to inspire the

confidenos of the people by bringing togsther those persons and elezents

whom the people trust end who ere not identified with the corrupt +e
past. The poople of Cuba, he said, cannct stand another disappoi-:tnent,

Their hopos must not be raised again, only to suffor anothor betrayal,

7. PROVISIONS, GOVERNENT, I brought up tho subject of-a provisional
fovernnent. a goverment in exile. but prafaced cy remarks by saying
thet I vas only expressing my personal vievs I saidt “Don't you
foel that the problem of whose sticker goes cn “he air drops, and who
gets credit for this or that, vould te resolved if an Assembly of
! Opposition Groups were to nest and to denocratically elect a provisional
: government, composed of honest, compotent msn of utizpeackable rocord,
: which would ropresant al] the diveres oppoaition groups and which would
. raisa the hopes ani proviae the will to fight to the Cubans in Cuba
who are uncertain ant confused with resmot to the future?"
He said he was opposed to a coalition rovernent rade up of reprecontatives
of various politicnl parties as a provisions! government because he
was sure such a governvent would act be eble to provide the united,
honest, non-partisen type of lecdorsip which will be required following
the fall of CiSTRO, He would prefer a governcent of "integration"
rather than a governzent of “coalition.” \By that he safd he meant
that the best qualified nen would be asked to serve their country in
an apolitical capacity, That these nen vould be seasured by their
experience, co:petenca, reputation, ete,, and little or no concern
should be givon en to their po'itioal affiliations, A goverment
cosposed of such men would quickly win the respect of the Cuban Poruletions
i these men could get on with ‘he job of rec-nstructing the eamtry,
i conpletely subordinsting partias; political eonside-stions, since
i such nen wou'd not be po'itioally ambitious. - horeover, a governnent
i compossd of such, outstanding zen would win’ the eonfidenos of foreign
tt countries which would be nore disrosed to grant Joang wiigh will be en
urgent necessity frem the very sturt. So for asthe sovarnment itsolf —_
fe conoorned, it would be apolitical, The verious politics) partics -
and their \eaiers vould be free to rrerare for the. caving elections -
vhether they ba in 6, 12 or 18 ronths at which tins the Cuban people
in free elections could decide which po*itical party it vented “to,
govern the country.

I asked RAY who would select those ron And at whet juncture of the
atrugrle against C5°R0 wuld a provisional covernvent azyear, Ho vue
a little fussy - rrobebly intontionally - on this soint. He clearly
Andiented that sone work hai alreaty boon xcconplished on the: mattor



of approso‘ing 2ikely candidates, He said core vould be dona in
eoming weeks, I asked if this ves to be a!aF sow - or vkether

the le-ders of the FW and other Cuban olenonts vould bo consulted,

Ke indicated that this was the plan ~ that ganera) agroszont vould

be sought = and that all groups would be froe to sug:nst candidates,
Hovevar, he felt it wae quite possible. for oxazpie. that the FRD
sould sugrest esniidates vro vould not nest the atrict otanderds

thst vould be sat and would havo to be rojeoted. ile was not cloor

go to who vould exercise this power of veto - but I gather that he folt
that the PRP wich represents or will represent (in his mind) the

party vhich comanis the greatest respect vithin the country, would
exorcise this frerogative, aI say, ho vas a little fussy on this
point ~ he ney not have wished to tip his hand. or ke may have felt that,
Fs wae 6 little presature for him to discuss this matter at groater

Gensrirury. 2240, I said to RAY, "I udorstan2 you do not want,
to retain the Constitution of 1940," He e-ited at this. He seid
this question kas been put to-hin before, Often belligerently,  .
However, he said, each tine that hé tas explained vhy he feels that
the Constitution rust bo revritten he has ended up convincing the
person in questica that csrtain fsatures of the Gonatitut‘on of 1940
are either wvorksble, unde“ocratic or obsolete. fie said fow of the
poople who gat vorked up over the Constitution keve over read the
Constitution ssi therefore do not know what they are talting about.
He said the Constitution is not 14k the Arerican Constitution

which ests out its precepts in general torns and covers basic
questions of goverment. The Cuban constitution 1s a long, revbling
document that cften goes into minuto detai's of ru'es and regulntion
which have no Flace in the basic Jay of the land. First he said. he
vanted to make it absolutely clear that he “loves” those provisions

of the Constitution vhich guarantes individual liberties, private
Property. ete. Kovever, there ara other parts of the Constitution
Witch ore inpraaticable, With respect to Agrarian Reform. he pointed
out, the Constituzicn requires immediate paynent. in cash. He said

dn no country of the world has on agrarian rrogran been carried out
with irmediate oash paynents. Not only doos the govarnzent not have the
nonsy to carry cut such a rrogram, but if. it. 1d-it vould result in
inflation and a sarious disloc:.tion of the’ eecnony, electoral

lava, he said, are very complex and those raleting: to-apportionzent

of the Congress can -nly rogult in corruption, ° I remathed: "Yoy
mean thoy are writtsa in such a vay ‘that they invite corruption?

He said: ‘Fore than that, they force corruption, " Me said under the
Present ast-up coe bas to either be a xitlionaire or be able to borrow

200,000 pasos (snd thus nocert commitments) in order to be elected to
congress, He said te vould like to eee this part of the Ccnetitution
written along the Avsrioan linop, Also, he said tho lava relating to
the raising of rewenus are archaic, Me said ttat tn onler to acquire
noney for a given vrocran, a specific tax rust bs applied designed



ile —

-

to provide that money, He said that what 4s nesded are fever taxa,
but nore general taxes which vill provide tho revonue neaded without
the neoossity of a hodge-podge of tax bi''s, No said that Felipe
Pazos, Rufo Lopes Fresiuet, end other oxyerienoed finance nen agree
that thie part of the Constitution must be reviesd, I caid: "shy nob
ezend the Constitution rather then rewrite it?* le replied that this
was a possibility, but that 1 would be sore practicable to write a
workable Constitution providing a1) the guarantees of a dexooraey

but oniting e lot of the drrolovant ani invorkable features of the

current one,

WIS FERS NA] PLANS, I said I understood that he vas plamving to rotura
to Cuba and asked if this “as correct. He said he ond others of bis
group plan to return at the appropriate tine but first he wanted to be
sure that he had nailed down certain political and support metters tere,
He said he was hopeful that the “political” ocnsiderations - which he
Andiented (without clarification) were going quite satisfactorily =
would be satisfactorily conoluied in "two weeks or go." WLZSINGER
asked: "Do you mean aftér 20 Jamucry?" 2:Y anilod but mada no reply.
He said that he hed hopad that ke had settled the matter of the logiatical
support when be talked to Kr. B last, but it now appears that it is

not settled end that they nay have to return to Cuba without this
support, He said ho was leaving for New York om 9 Janunry and would
ronain thore until] Saturday, 15 Jonuary, He said he sould be ranchod
through Raul CHIBAS, I told him that I thought he sould return, as
soon ae he could, and that wo wore prepared to assist him in every vay
possible, including providing lim vith a‘comamicator. He eaid we hod
already trained a comamicator for his group who had been infiltrated
into Cuba and ho wendered viere that man vas at the prosent tine =
whether in Luvana or the hille. Neither I nor WIESINGER sould enlirhten
him on this point, except to say that he vas safoly in Cuba,

During the entire interview. with no exco;tion. RAY was hie usual
quiet, soft-spoken self, Fowever, ho 111 sow ecotion when he asted ne.
if I thought s-oeone was trying to sabotace hie efforts to mirply the
roeistance groups in Cuba. For example. Ne first brought up ani it
was ~ost obvious that it ie « setter of great cconoorn-io him. the
matter of the plens, saps, eto., for the !'RP action arainat the Isle of
Pines, He said a carefully coorlinated plan had beorlaid on, That
BARQUIN disoussed it with “Jinmy." That EAR NIN asked "Tirmy" if the
map and other pupors could be detivared in Cuba within 43 hours,
"Jirmy" assured DARUIN that they could and B.NQVIN landed them over,
RAY said that BAR IN erred in doing this as thoy hed there own
faeilitios fcr transaitting tho papers, The payers nevor arrived at
their dostination. nor have thoy evar baon heart free again, As &
conse yusnes. 3 plan of great inv: rtanes had to be abantoned, and an
irreplaceable opportunity loat. io vas extranely agitated uten be

worked up on the {asus and vill not be content until ho has a
eatisfactory explenation, Nov, ke says, ho $s coatr-nted vith the
delay in the air drop to the people in the Ssconbrays, "Do you think
acmeone vants those man wiped cut for sons reagon or other and

that this 46 vhy thoss unacceptable confitions are placed at the last
ninute?® He vas assured nothing could be farther frea tho truth, but
still this 4s a concrote example of tia be’ fof that he has not received
{he support that he hes boon lead to believe he will reonive,

ERP TSTRLICTCS ORGANIZATION, Ve disoussod briefly tho MRP into)
group being organized undor NISSINGSR's guidanos, lo pointed out that
Little prozress had baon made dus to the fat that MRWIN ~ RAYts
designees for the job ~ had so many other responsibilities that ha
could not cive this matter hia wniiviled attention, RAY laughed

and said that B’RiUIN hes boon eiven ho othor resyonsibitities, but
that he hes sought cut othor resroiaibivities on hia oun which are

tine taking, He promised to think about this ond was agredabla to
assigning a “siirt sleeve" typs of operator to work with WiZSINCR

on the nute end bolts, The nene of Nlooles VEIDC7ZA vas sugceated

by tho undersigned (in prior consultetion vith VJESINGSR) es a peroon
of cousiderable intel ligonos and drive and ondoved with a willingness
to carry cut onters, Nicolas, wie 48 a brother of one of RAY's
closest men, Ignacio MEIDOZA. was acceptable to RAY and he asked
WISSINGSR 4f he could ascertain Nco'as' sresent whereabouts so

that he could be propoaitioned on the subject.

The reating broke up after ten of clock, It vas cordial throughout
and I fee) cleared the air a little although 4t settled no mutters of
consequences, I told RAY I waa going to Washington of Nanday and,
after congultstions, might wish to sao him again, He said he vould
welcone sxother got-together ani that I could reach him through
CHIBAS during the current wek,
