Atlanta noted in conducting this review, that
a few of the original Elsur logs had several entries made
with a light blue ink and as a results, these enti¥es were
somewhat faint on the xerox copies. Efforts to improve
the quality of these particular copies of the Elsur logs
were: unsuccessful as the light blue ink does not copy
well.

It is noted that Atlanta has placed a three by
five card as a flag on the serials listed below, namely:

as these serials had information in various paragraphs,

that by its nature, identified a former confidential source
of the Atlanta Office and this information should be deleted
prior to being furnished to the HSCA. These three by five
card flags set forth the appropriate paragraphs that should
be deleted in these serials.

NOTE: Based on the time period of interest to the HSCA, only
Sections 1 through 36 of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,/
Poor Peoples March. have been prepared for HSCA access.

To date, Congressional Inquiry Unit: procedure has been
to remove classified information from material being prepared
for HSCA access and to make the classified material available
upon request only to HSCA staff members with appropriate security
clearance. Since most staff members now have their clearances
and the volume of classified serials involved in this request is
considerable, all classified information is being left in the -
material processed for the HSCA. The Congressional Inquiry Unit’
will insure that only HSCA staff members with their security
clearances will be granted access to these files.

This response completes the November 30, 1977, HSCA
request. . : +

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: Through review of National States Rights Party (NSRP) activities,
the HSCA learned of SL 1495-E (former), who is identical with Patterson.
Prior to submitting referenced request, the HSCA asked that SL 1495-E be
contacted to determine if he would cooperate with the Committee. Prior
to our contacting the informant, the HSCA submitted its request for his
files. The informant, when contacted by St. Louis, declined to cooperate
with the Committee. However, after contact by the HSCA, he submitted a
waiver (attached) authorizing delivery of his FBI files, vouchers,
personal reports, etc. This waiver was delivered to FBIHQ by the HSCA
on 2-13-78.

SL 1495-E (Bufile 134-19686) was operated from January, 1970,
to approximately September, 1971, targeted primarily against White Hate
groups. Being provided to the HSCA are copies of his informant files
from St: Louis and at FBIHQ, as well as FBIHQ references. The Voucher
and Payroll Section advised that in furnishing copies of informant
vouchers their policy is to provide receipts only and not the blue slip
or FD-221A. Receipts showing 19 occasions when SL 1495-E was paid are
being provided to HSCA.

We should take exception to the Committee's speculation
concerning identities or informants in correspondence in an effort to
avoid any future indiscretions by the HSCA. This matter has been coordinated
with SAM. VY. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal
Investigative Division, and D. 0. Coulson, Legal Liaison and Congressional
Affairs Unit.

CIVIL RIGHTS ~- CONSPIRACY

On November 21, 1977, retired Special Agent Joe C.
Hester appeared at Washington, D. C., at the request of the
House Committee on Assassinations.

Mr. Hester met with the Committee staff in their
offices at Washington, D. C., and was interviewed for a
total of four hours by two different groups of five persons
each. Both groups were affable and were not in any way
eritical of the investigation conducted in this case,

The first group of five interviewers asked a
variety of questions but seemed to be particularly preoccupied
with the investigation conducted by Legats in Mexico.

Mr. Hester was able to answer many of the general questions
regarding the activities of Legats but referred them to
Assistant Director Richard Long when they began to ask more
specific questions regarding the investigations by Legats
and the manner of transmittal of this information to FBI
Headquarters .(¢)

The second group of five interviewers asked more
general questions regarding the Bureau's investigation of
the King murder. They seemed to be greatly concerned with
the allegation of conspiracy. Mr. Hester advised them that
he believed the conspiracy theory was an invention by the
Department of Justice to be used to justify the FBI's
investigation of Dr. King's murder. Mr. Hester advised them
that he had never personally believed there was a conspiracy
and he did not believe that any of his FBI superiors had
ever believed in the conspiracy theory. Mr. Hester further
advised that it was his personal opinion that James Earl Ray,
acting alone, had murdered Dr. King and that his subsequent
travels were probably financed by armed robbery.

RE: JAMES EARL RAY; |
Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - VICTIM

Lees eee

This group was concerned with how the subject Ray
had known how to obtain false documents following his arrival
in Canada. Mr. Hester pointed out that a "Top Ten" criminal
had been arrested in Canada and had been returned to the
Missouri State Penitentiary and had served time there with
James Earl Ray prior to Ray's escape. Mr. Hester indicated
it was his belief that this "Top Ten" fugitive had been
responsible for instructing Ray on how to proceed in obtaining
false documents in Canada.

This group touched on such diverse elements as the
information furnished by John McFerren regarding Frank Liberto,
and one of the interviewers agreed that they had not believed
McFerren to be a very reliable witness. They also discussed
Ray's purchase of the rifle in Birmingham; the fact that
Officer Redditt was moved from the firehouse near the Lorraine
Motel just prior to the murder; what motive did Ray have for
killing Dr. King; whether or not there was any evidence to
indicate a conspiracy; whether or not there were any wiretaps
and whether or not there had been any surreptitious entries
made against King and his followers at Memphis prior to the
assassination; and when, following his escape, did Ray appear
to have made up his mind to assassinate Dr. King.

In addition, they asked numerous questions about
the political climate in Memphis just prior to the assassi-
nation and inquired as to what investigation was being conducted
by the FBI in régard to the Sanitation Workers Strike and the
first march conducted by Dr. King. Mr. Hester was forced to
admit that he had had nothing to do with the investigation of
Dr. King prior to the murder and he suggested that they talk
to current Special Agent Howell S. Lowe who would be in a
position to furnish information in this regard.

They inquired about the interview of James Earl
Ray conducted by former Special Agent in Charge Robert G.
Jensen, former Special Agent Robert F. Boyle, and Mr. Hester
at the state prison in Nashville, Tennessee, following Ray's
plea of guilty. Mr. Hester recounted as best he could recall

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: The letter of 11/3/77, requested information on 35

items, a number of which were subsequently modified by the HSCA’
letter of 11/8/77, another letter of 11/9/77, (not attached)

and through conferences with the HSCA personnel. Partial
responses have been submitted to the HSCA as documents in
response to certain items have been processed. This response
completes all requested items in the letter of 11/3/77.

Information processed concerning Item 35, Herman A.
Thompson, included Bufile 1-8332, which contained results of his
background investigation prior to attending the 63rd Session of
the National Academy in 1959. Discussions by D. 0. Coulson,

Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, with the HSCA have
determined that access to background information on Thompson

will greatly assist the Committee in one aspect of its inquiry.

The nature of the HSCA's interest in Thompson is unknown. Since
Thompson's file contains no derogatory information, representatives
of the Legal Liaison and the Congressional Inquiry Units believe
the HSCA should be given access to Thompson's National Academy

Dear Senator Meicher: = mttes 1 ASSASSI Mah tr

This is to acknowledgé receipt of your communi-
cation dated April 5, 1977.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated “fl
a security investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1962 7
to determine the scope and depth of Conmunist influence upon

him. This investigation terminated at the time of his death

in 1968. Similar investigations have also been conducted on

a number of his associates who were either known or alleged Gr
to have Communist connections. The results of these inves-
tigations have been made available to the Department of
Justice and other interested agencies of the IO. F-

With respect to results of G2-MLIAIG: Y = PSMA

surveillance of King conducted during this investigation,
the following information may be of interest to you. On
January 31, 1977, U. S. District. Court Judge John Lewis
Smith, Ir. dismissed two civil suits filed against the FBI c
by a former assistant to King and the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, which King headed until his death.

. The court ordered the FBI to file with the National Archives”
all of its tapes and documents obtained through telephone
and microphone surveillances of King and that this material
not be made public for at least 50 years, except. by court
order. The FBI is currently in the process of pomaane
eee this court order. ANS

_NOTE: Senator John Melcher's letter enclosed an article
from "The Review of the News," a publication printed in -
Belmont, Massachusetts. This article discussed former
King associates and their Communist connections and states
that King's "public record" illustrates good reason for
the FBI to have considered him "dangerous". The article is
supportive of the FBI's investigation of King and criticizes
the Senate Intelligence Committee, under Senator Frank Church, 7
for refusing to release the FBI file on King and electronic
surveillance results, which "proved that Martin Luther King
was indeed a person of low moral character who had fallen
under the control of the Communist."

In his letter, Senator Melcher believes that if
electronic surveillance records existed on King they should a,
not be kept secret and that the files and facts must be 1
made public.

Although Senator Melcher does not request a reply,
it should be pointed out to him that allegations of Communist
influence on King and his associates have been investigated
and that a Federal court has ruled regarding the results of
our electronic surveillance of King being made public.

Delay in responding occurred because Senator
Melcher's enclosure did not arrive with his original letter,’
and a copy of the enclosure was not provided our Congressional
Liaison Unit until 4/21/77. .

-®-Senator-Frank-Church-(D,-Idaho)
has turned the Senate Intelligence
Committee into a vehicle for smearing
the late F.B.I. Director J. Edgar
Hoover. Hoover's private files show
that he had become convinced that
Martin Luther King was a person of
low: moral character who had fallen
under the control of the Communists.
Church claims to find this absurd.
Attomey General Robert Kennedy,
however, did not find it absurd in the
least and authorized F.BI. surveil-
lance of. King — including wiretaps,

* which were maintained between 1963

and 1966. :
Those'wiretaps and other évidence
proved that Martiri Luther King was
indeed a person of low moral character
who had fallen under -the control of
the Communists. But Senator Church
has, like Richard Nixon, ducked the

ing tapes. And the “Liberal” press has
“cooperated by laboring to create the
myth that Martin Luther King was an
innocent victim of Director Hoover's
bad temper.

The F.B.I. has been accused of play-
ing “dirty tricks” on Martin Luther
King. It has been accused of threaten-
ing to release information in its files
that would have been damaging to
King’s respectability. And almost
nothing has been said about Martin
Luther King’s notoriqus immorality
and Communist associates. The New
York Times, on November 19, 1975,
commented: “The committee staff
members said they could find no jus-
tification for the bureau’s attack on
Dr. King.” The Senate Intelligence
Committee would like us to believe
that Martin Luther King was under

surveillance because he criticized the
FBI.

‘We do not know what information is
in the substantial F.B.1. file on Dr.
King, but we do know that even the
most cursory look at Martin Luther
King’s public record should convince

. the merest tyro that there was very
good reason for Director Hoover to con-
sider King “dangerous.”

Martin Luther King was quoted i in
the New York World Telegram of July
23, 1964, as declaring: “[J am] sick
and tired of people saying this move-
ment has been infiltrated by Commu-
nists and Communist sympathizers.
‘There are as many Communists in
this freedom movement as there are
Eskimos in Florida.” One hardly has to
look at the entire “freedom move-

, ment” to find evidence of Communist.
infiltration — though the level of infil-
tration was overwhelming when the
whole movement is considered. Rath-
er, to -be scrupulously fair, let us
look directly under Dr. King’s nose —
at those persops closest to him — and
see what we find.

Hunter PittO"Dell come to work

Dr King’s staff cona\ iltant. ‘In the fall
of 1962 he was promoted to acting
staff director in charge of voter regis-

aati tration and integration workshops.

During this period, O’Dell was a mem-
ber of the National Committee of the
Communist Party. The “Liberal”
press ignored it. Finally, on October
26, 1961, the St. Louis Globe-Demo-
erat revealed that in 1956 and 1958

2

Hunter Pitts O’Dell had been identi-

fied under oath as a Communist
organizer. .

‘What did Martin Luther King do?
He announced that he had discharged
Comrade O’Dell.

A few months later it was discov-
ered that O'Dell had not been fired
but promoted, and was now running
King’s large New York office! When
the story hit, Dr. King claimed to have
discharged O’Dell a second time. A
subsequent check by U.P.I. deter-

mined that Hunter Pitts,0’Dell of the
National Commi ge Commu-

‘ing called “‘a brilliant,
efficient and dedicated organizer and
one-of the best and most persuasive
interpreters of nonviolence.” He was
secretary and advisor to King from
1956 to 1960, and went with him to
Oslo to receive the Nobel Prize in
1964.

given 60 days in jail in California for

working for King was one of only five
“impartial observers” at the Commu-
nist Party’s closed-door 16th national
convention in 1957, That is only part
of the record.

president of the Southern Conference
Educational Fund (S.C.E.F.). This
group was thoroughly investigated by
Committees of both the House and
Senate and repeatedly found to have’
been a major Communist operation.
On November 26, 1963, Shuttlesworth
was one of two honored guests at the
15th anniversary dinner of the Na-
tional Guardian, described by a}Con-
gressional Committee as “a virtual
official propaganda arm of SovietRug-
sia.” A former bootlegger, Fred Shut-
tlesworth’s Communist, Communist
Front, and radical activities fill three’
typewritten pages. King said of Shut=
tlesworth: “Reverend Shuttlesworth is
my principal aide. Why, he gave me
my start and he advised me from the
very first, J depend on him.” *
JamesXBevel was Martin Luther’
Ss Coe aide in Chicago. He has
must move to destroy
‘Western Capitalism.” At a Black
Power rally at Berkeley,, Lslifornia, in
1966 Bevel announced: “One of the
problems of not being able to burn
down the slums of Chicago is at this
point not having the proper discipline
réquired for the problems of carrying
out that kind of a mission, That is why
we haven’t burned it down... . We
are going to.be part ofan international
revolution to end lavery ....
I hate Western Ci

The “Reverend” Bevel.continued to
emphasize the destruction of capital-
ism, and then he told the crowd that,
when John Kennedy was President,
Bevel had told people: “If the Vietcong

In a letter discovered by govern-

Comrade Dombrowski: “Dear Jim:

Carl and Anng{Graden have both

of the S.C.E.F., were part of the “Lou-
eee isville Seven” — a group responsible
aad for purchasing a house in an all-white
area of Louisville, selling it to a Negro
Renan family, and then dynamiting it to stir
: up racial trouble.
King wrote a letter to the Bradens
Hi in- 1959 urging them to become-per-
manently associated with his Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.

nual conference of the S.C.L:C. in
1962, and found in the files of James

‘James Dombrowski, and describes
King on the back as “responding: to

government post because of his affilia-
TN \ tions with the Communist apparatus.
—— ‘In 1954, Williams.was identified under
‘oath as a_ member of the Communist
‘Party by two witnesses.
_~~_, Two years later, in 1957, King was
‘ hotographech with Williams, Myles
{ A_Horton, Abner erry (a member of the
‘entral Committe of the Communist
, Party), and other Comrades at a Com-
~_ Taunist training school in Tennessee.
King referred to Williams as “one of
the noble persdnglities of our times.”
Ralph Davi jathy was Mar-
—

tin Luther King’s top aide from the
time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
He succeeded King as head of the
$.C.L.C. Abernathy accompanied Dr.
King to that Communist training
school in Tennessee in 1957. And they
had more than their radical commit-
-ment in common. In the 1958 case of
Alabama v. Davis, sworn testimony
was introduced regarding sexual aber-
rations committed by Abernathy on a
15-year-old girl who sang in the choir of
his church.

Not only is Abernathy an active
supporter of such Communist causes
as the effort to free Communist Angela
Davis, but in 1972 he was an honored
guest of the Soviet Union and of Com-
munist East Germany (G.D.R.), where
he declared: “As pastor and theo-
‘Togian, T am of thé opinion that the
G.D.R. embodies what we aspire to in
the world.” Two" hours before his de-
parture ‘he told a Communist Party

Press conference: “What we are still
fighting for in‘the U.S.A. is what has

already been-achiieved in the G.D.R.”

‘The East German Communists gave
‘Abernathy a medal, and reported that
agents of th sir leading religious Front
had “for m iny years” been in corres-
pondence vith Martin Luther ‘King.
They presei sted the “Reverend” Aber-
nathy with i German edition of Coret-
ta Scott King’s My Life With Martin
Luther Kin.1.end he declared: “‘Presi-
dent Kennedy once said in West Berlin
that he was a Berliner. 1 want to
change that and say: ‘I am a Citizen of
the [Communist] German Democratic
Republic.’ ” .

Lirrte wonder that after lengthy
investigation the Joint Legislative
Committee on Un-American Activities
for the State of Louisiana concluded in
its three-part Report on the activities of
S.C. that the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, headed by
Martin Luther King, was “substantial-
ly under the control of the Communist
Party through the influence of the
Southern Conference Educational
Fund [S.C.E.F.] and the Communists
who manage it.”

If Martin Luther King was “sick
and tired of people saying this move-
ment has been infiltrated by Commu-
nists and Communist sympathizers,”
it was because he knew it was true.

And so did J. Edgar Hoover and the
F.B.I. Director Hoover spoke out many
times to warn of Communist involve-
ment in the “civil rights” movement.
On one occasion, he said: “We do know
that Communist influence does exist
in the Negro moverent and it is this
influence which is vi ‘ally important.”
Hoover declared thatthe Communist
Party “strives only to dxploit what are
often legitimate Negro c»mplaints and
grievances for the advincement of
Communist objectives . . . . Racial in-
cidents are magnified .and drama-
tized by Communists in an effort to

« «« Mr. King was one of the worst
enemies my people ever had.

I know that it is considered poor
taste to speak ill of the dead. But when
someone served the enemies of our
country while alive, and his name is
still used by his comrades to promote
anti-American activities, shouldn't
people who know the truth speak out?

I learned many surprising things
while I served in the Communist Party
for the FBI. Communist leaders told us *
about the demonstrations that would
be started, the protest marches, the
demands that would be made for mas-
sive federal intervention. Every Com-
munist was ordered to help convince
American Negroes that we are no bet-
ter off than slaves. Wherever we went
and whatever we did, we were to pro-
mote race consciousness and resent-
‘ment, because the Communists know
that the technique of divide and con-
quer really works.

We were also told to promote Mar-
tin Luther King, to unite Negroes and
whites behind him, and to turn him
into some sort of national hero. We
were to look to King as the leader in
this struggle, the Communists said,
because he was on-our side!

I know they were right, because

-while I was in the Communist Party I

learned that Martin Luther King at-
tended a Communist training school. I
learned that several of his aides and
assistants were Communists, that he
received funds from Communists, and
that he was taking directions from
Communists.

Most Americans never look at the

5



Communist press in this country. If
no cece they did, they would learn that the
Communists loved Martin Luther
King. He was one of their biggest
heroes. And'I know for a fact the Com-
munists would never have promoted
him, financed him, and supported him
if they couldn’t trust him, He carried
out their orders just as slavishly as
Party members in Cleveland, Ohio.

Little wonder that F.B.I. Director J.
Edgar Hoover called Martin Luther
King “‘the’ most notorious liar in the

+ country.”

We do not know what additional
information Mr. Hoover had on King,
but after years of electronic surveil-

. lance he certainly knew much more

:than we'have been ablé to present in,

this brief survey from the public rec- "

ord: Yet the Senate Intelligence Com-

fe mittee has refused to release the F.B.I.

file on King. They chose instead to

attack -the F.B.I. for using “dirty

tricks,” and members of the Commit-

tee staff said “they could find no justi-

fication for the bureau’s attack on Dr.

King.” Incredibly, a U.P.I. release on

“November 19, 1975, declared: “Atop

FBI official said Wednesday that the

5 Bureau had no legal justification for its

ff smear campaign against Dr. Martin

eeeaee Luther King Jr. but suspected, with-

out evidence, he might be under ‘Com-
munist influence.’ ”

“Suspected, without evidence.

ecm ee f

. . .” "That is, as we have seen, simply fe |
not true. And the distortion is intended : ‘|
to damage the reputation of both the :
F.B.1. and the late Director J, Edgar
Hoover. :

John J. McDermott, Assistant Di- io
rector of the F.B.1., spoke on November .
21, 1975, before-a Connecticut group. ~ s
which aids families of policemen, fire-
men, and corrections officers, killed in
the line of duty. He said the F.B.1.’s ‘
six-year surveillance of Martin Luther z
King was justified because of concern :
that King was influenced by subver-
sives. He put it this way: “We did what
we felt we had.to do for the welfare of
the nation at the time. Don’t forget
they [radicals and Communists] were
bomibing the Pentagon. They said they
Were going to shut down the govern-
ment.” Another F.B.1. official re-
minded us that the King projects
“were started at a time when cities
were being burned... .”

We believe most Americans would
agree that our law enforcement author-
ities should keep under surveillance
any person or group about which there
is substantial evidence of involvement
in such crimes as revolutionary vio-
lence, Communist subversion, and con-
spiracy with agents of a foreign power to
overthrow the U.S. Government by
force and violence. To the extent the
F.B.1. maintained such surveillance un- *
der J. Edgar Hoover, we heartily ap-
plaud its efforts. a= .

EDERAL GOVERWMENG
Qugust 15, 1977

Honorable Louis Stokes
<$" Chaimman
Ozouse Select Committee on Assassinations
House of Representatives
Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This is to confirm that pursuant to your request copies
of two memoranda concerning Dr. Martin L.7King, Jr., have been
supplied to your Committee's staff. These memoranda are
Memorandum dated 9 April 1976 for the Attorney General from
the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, and the

Memorandum dated March 31, 1976, to the Assistant Attorney
General, Civil Rights Division, from the Chief, Criminal
Section of that Division.

The copies which ‘have been provided have been excised to
protect highly sensitive national icivianiate EE TTG:
WES W- oe ay
By memoranda dated June 6, 1977, and Ree 21, 1977, th
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, has brought to my
attention certain matters which the FBI feels constitute
inaccurate or incomplete statements in these memoranda. In
the opinion of the FBI as reflected by these memoranda, the
items are as follows: >
Yy
26,

Q
"(1) Page 5, paragraph 2, REG memorandum — ates
that the King investigation was continuously handled by SA
Seymor Phillips. Actually, Phillips' supervision of the case
ended in late 1965. © AUG 24 1977"

"(2) Page 34, Paragraph 1, Murphy memorandum —COntSLHS
information regarding mail openings, which should be excised as-
a sensitive investigative technique.

ce: ae Mr. Aldhizer

yo" alt

D Page 105 . .


~2-

"(3) Paragraph 1, page 34, of the Murphy memorandum
contains a statement, "Electronic surveillance of the
Convention was widespread . . .' (Democratic Convention,
Atlantic City, New Jersey, August, 1964). ‘The manner and
context in which this statement appears very strongly imply
that there was an electronic surveillance (by the FBI) on
the floor or elsewhere in the Auditorium where the Convention
took place. We know of no such electronic surveillance by
us ox anyone else. In point of fact, the FBI did have two
electronic surveillances in effect in Atlantic City during
the period of the Convention. One was a telephone surveillance
on an individual at a hotel. - The other was a microphone
surveillance at a storefront jointly occupied by two organiza-
tions. We believe that the implication of an FBI electronic
surveillance at the Convention site is of such serious
significance that the facts in this matter should be brought
to the attention of the HSCA in any furnishing to it of the
Murphy memorandum.

"(4) Page 44, Paragraph 2, Murphy memorandum — states
that former Assistant Director William C. Sullivan took the
tapes and stationery and later gave Phillips a package to
deliver to SA Whitson. Phillips has no knowledge regarding
to whom this package was to be delivered. In addition, he
was unaware of the package contents or the purpose of its
delivery. 7

"(5) Page 46, Paragraph 1, Murphy memorandum —- incor-
_ rectly states that SA Leinbaugh was the originator of the
Lorraine Hotel “COINTELPRO activity.* :

"(6) Page 9 of the Pottinger report contains a state- -
ment, "fhe files reflect that the Bureau's action, especially
in mailing of the tape, . ..' (This refers to a mailing of
a tape to the King household in Atlanta, Georgia). From
all records available at the FBI there appears to be no
doubt that a tape was mailed to the King family. There is
no record in our files, nor has any individual come.:forward
with any information, to indicate that the mailing of the
tape was an official FBI action. Rather, the indication is

NW 55057 DocId:32989750 Page 106


that the mailing of the tape was by an individual who was
then an Assistant Director of the FBI but with no indication
it was with the approval of any higher authority, including
the late Director, J. Edgar Hoover. We have previously
indicated this position to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities (Church Committee) and to the Depart
ment. It is believed that our position relating to the mail-
ing of the tape should be made known to the HSCA in the évent
it is furnished the Pottinger report." Pets

Very truly yours,

Assistant Attorney General
Criminal Division
Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: HSCA letter of 12/9/77; requested if any electronic
surveillance was conducted against four individuals and the
National States Rights Party (NSRP). The HSCA only desired
confirmation as to the existence of such electronic surveillance
and did not desire the results of any surveillance.

The NSRP was subject of electronic surveillance during
5/6-7/59, (MISUR), Atlantic Hotel, Chicago, Illinois; 3/19-20/60,
(MISUR), Midway Lodge, Miamisburg, Ohio; 6/16/62, (MISUR),
LaSalle Hotel, Chicago, Illinois. : :

On 8/27/62, authority was granted for a microphone
surveillance of the NSRP, actually the rooms of Edward R. Fields
and J. B. Stoner, at the Whitley Hotel, Montgomery, Alabama.
June files of the NSRP, Fields and Stoner do not. show that this
surveillance was-actually installed.

During our investigation concerning the desegregation of
the University of Alabama in 1963. authority was received from
the Department to install technical coverage of the residence
of Fields and/or the NSRP Headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama,
and the residence of Stoner in Mableton, Georgia. Installations
were not made, however, because telephone companies involved
were unable to insure complete security. (Bufile 157-778)

During our investigation into the chur¢h bombing (BAPBOMB)
in 1963, technical surveillance of NSRP Headquarters, actually
the residence of James K. Warner, Birmingham, Alabama, was.
conducted from 10/25/63, to 11/25/63. (Bufile 157-1025)

On 2/27/64, authority was granted for microphone coverage
of the NSRP convention, Louisville, Kentucky, but no actual
installation was made for security reasons. However, installation
was made on thé room of Fields at. the Sheraton Hotel, Louisville.
Coverage was from 2/28/64, to 3/1/64. Authorization was
‘specifically granted for-Fields' room and not for the NSRP,

Except as outlined above, no additional electronic
surveillance was approved or conducted against Fields.

for all information contained in Bureau files relative to
seventeen listed individuals. This request has been
coordinated with the Legal Counsel Division.

A review of Buréau files has identified some main
files, references and ident records for eight of the seventeen
individuals. None of the documents identified appear to. have
any relationship to MURKIN.

On 11/19/77; Michael C. Eberhardt, Staff Counsel, HSCA,
was advised by SA John T. McGirl that a review of Bureau files
re Richard Yarbrough, one of the above listed individuals,
revealed that he was listed along with eight other persons as
the subject of two related ITAR matters (166-1570; 166-3249).
Yarbrough was the only subject of these two investigations
not indicted or convicted. Mr. Eberhardt advised, in view of
this fact, coupled with the fact it did not appear that thése
investigations would have any bearing on the HSCA's present
inquiry, it was not necessary for both of these files to be
.prepared in their entirety for the Committee's access. He
stated it would be sufficient to prepare only those ‘documents
where reference is made to Yarbrough.

In accordance with HSCA's request and the agreement
reached with Mr. Eberhardt, retrievable documents in FBI
Headquarters file have been prepared for the Committee's access
and are being maintained by the Congressional Inquiry Unit. —~
