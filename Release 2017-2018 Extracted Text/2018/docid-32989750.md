Information concerning Oliver Block Patterson. On February 13, 1978,

HSCA Staff Attorney Michael Eberhardt equested that material concerning

Patterson be delivered to the ESCA.

Enclosed are seven attachments which contain pertinent informa-

tion from the files of FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) and the St. Louis Office

of the EBI in response to the above ESCA request.

Where information is

not provided, it is either not retrievable or is not being furnished

pursuant to the Menorandum of Underständing"

In addition to requesting Patterson's Identification Division

record and material concerning his affiliation with the National States

Rights Party, referenced letter asked for informant files concerning

Patterson, including materials and vouchers which would reflect his

informant activities.

The FBI feels It is improper for the USCA to

speculate in correspondence as to the identities of FBI Informants

Regardless of whether or not ISCA's speculation is accurate, such action

could result in possible compronise of sensitive informants and hinder

jeopardy. It is requested that matters which may pertain to FBI informants.

and sources, or any other matters of obvious sensitivity, be brought to

the attention of designated Department of Justice and IBI officials

responsible for liaison with the ESCA, prior to submitfing a request

in writing.

NOTE: Through review of National States Rights Party (NSRP) activities,

the HSCA learned of SL 1495-E (former), who is identical with Patterson.

Prior to submitting referenced request, the HSCA asked that SL 1495-E be

contacted to determine if he would cooperate with the Committee. Prior

to our contacting the informant, the HSCA submitted its request for his

The informant, when contacted by St. louis, declined to cooperate

with the Committee.

However, after contact by the HSCA, he submitted a

waiver (attached) authorizing delivery of his FBI files, vouchers,

personal reports, etc. This waiver was delivered to FBIHQ by the HSCA

on 2-13-78.

SL 1495-E (Bufile 134-19686) was operated from January, 1970,

to approximately September, 1971, targeted primarily against White Hate

groups. Being provided to the HSCA are copies of his informant files

from St. Louis and at FBIHQ, as well as FBIHQ references.

The Voucher

and Payroll Section advised that in furnishing copies of informant

vouchers their policy is to provide receipts only and not the blue slip

or ED-221A.

Receipts showing 19 occasions when SL 1495-E was paid are

being provided to HSCA.

We should take exception to the Committee's speculation

concerning identities or informants in correspondence in an effort to

avoid any future indiscretions by the HSCA. This matter has been coordinated

with SA M. V. Hale, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal

Investigative Division, and D. O. Coulson, Legal Liaison and Congressional

Affairs Unit.

JAMES EARL RAY;

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - VICTIM;

CIVIL RIGHTS - CONSPIRACY

On November 21, 1977, retired Special Agent Joe C.

Hester appeared at washington, D. C., at the request of the

House Committee on Assassinations.

Mr. Hester met with the Committee staff in their

offices at Washington, D. C., and was interviewed for a

total of four hours by two different groups of five persons

each. Both groups were affable and were not in any way

critical of the investigation conducted in this case.

The first group of five interviewers asked a

variety of questions but seemed to be particularly preoccupied

with the investigation conducted by Legats in Mexico.

Mr. Hester was able to answer many of the general questions

regarding the activities of Legats but referred them to

Assistant Director Richard Long when they began to ask more

specific questions regarding the investigations by Legats

and the manner of transmittal of this information to FBI

Headquarters. (e)

The second group of five interviewers asked more

general questions regarding the Bureau's investigation of

the King murder.

They seemed to be greatly concerned with

the allegation of conspiracy. Mr. Hester advised them that

he believed the conspiracy theory was an invention by the

Department of Justice to be used to justify the FBI's

investigation of Dr. King's murder.

Mr. Hester advised them

that he had never personally believed there was a conspiracy

and he did not believe that any of his FBI superiors had

ever believed in the conspiracy theory. Mr. Hester further

i Do the conspiracy

advised that it was his personal opinion that James Earl Ray,

acting alone, had murdered Dr. King and that his subsequent

travels were probably financed by armed robbery.

conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of ithe FBI and is

RE:

JAMES EARL RAY;

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - VICTIM

le tos so it i wad come to the twice to it?

This group was concerned with how the subject Ray

had known how to obtain false documents following his arrival

in Canada. Mr. Hester pointed out that a "Top Ten" criminal

had been arrested in Canada and had been returned to the

Missouri State Penitentiary

and had served time there with

James Earl Ray prior to Ray's escape.

Mr. Hester indicated

it was his belief that this "Top Ten" fugitive had beer

responsible for instructing Ray on how to proceed in obtaining

false documents in Canada.

This group touched on such diverse elements as the

information furnished by John McFerren regarding Frank Liberto,

and one of the interviewers agreed that they had not believed

McFerren to be a very reliable witness. They also discussed

Ray's purchase of the rifle in Birmingham; the fact that

Officer Redditt was moved from the firehouse near the Lorraine

Motel just prior to the murder; what motive did Ray have for

killing Dr. King; whether or not there was any evidence to

indicate a conspiracy; whether or not there were any wiretaps

and whether or not there had been any surreptitious entries

made against King and his followers at Memphis prior to the

assassination; and when, following his escape, did Ray appear

to have made up his mind to assassinate Dr. King.

In addition,

they asked numerous questions about

the political climate

in Memphis just prior to the assassi-

nation and inquired as to what investigation was being conducted

by the FBI in regard to the Sanitation Workers Strike and the

first march conducted by Dr. King.

Mr. Hester was forced to

admit that he had had nothing to do with the investigation of

DI. King prior to the murder and he suggested that they talk

to current Special Agent Howell S. Lowe who would be in a

position to furnish information in this regard.

They inquired about the interview of James Earl

Ray conducted by former Special Agent in Charge Robert G.

Jensen, former Special Agent Robert F. Boyle, and Mr. Hester

at the state prison in Nashville, Tennessee,

following Ray's

plea of guilty.

Mr. Hester recounted as best he could recall

the events that transpired in connection with this attempted

interview and advised the interviewers that former Special

Agent Robert F. Boyle has suffered a cerebral hemmorrhage

and possibly might not be competent to furnish information

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiäted

a security investigation of Martin luther King, Jr., in 1962

to determine the scope and depth of Communist influence upon

This investigation terminated at the time of his death

in 1968. Similar investigations have also been conducted on

Iith respect to results of our electronic

surveillance of king conducted during this investigation,

the following Information may be of interest to you.

January 31, 1917, U:S. District Court Juage John Lewis

smith, Jr., dismissed two civil suits filed against the FBI

by a former assistant to king and the southern Christian

Leadership Conference, which King headed until his death.

The court ordered the FBI to file with the National Archives

all of its tapes and documents obtained through telephone

and microphone surveillances of King and that this material

not be made public for at least

50 years, except. by court

order.

The FBI is currently in

Honorable John Melcher

NOTE: Senator John Melcher's letter enclosed an article

from

"The Review of the News," a publication printed in

Belmont, Massachusetts. This article discussed former

King associates and their Communist connections and states

that King's "public record" illustrates good reason for

the FBI to have considered him "dangerous".

The article is

supportive of the FBI's investigation of King and criticizes

the Senate Intelligence Committee, under senator Frank Church,

for refusing to release the FBI file on King and electronic

surveillance results,

which "proved that Martin Luther King

was indeed a person of low moral character who had fallen

under the control of the Communist."

In his letter, Senator Melcher believes that 1f

electronic surveillance records existed on King they should

not be kept secret and that the files and

facts must be

made public.

Although Senator Melcher does not request a reply,

¿ should be pointed out to him that allegations of communis

nfluence on King and his associates have been investigate

and that a Federal court has ruled regarding the results of

our electronic surveillance of king being made public.

Hunter Pitts O'Dell came to work

for the Southern Christian Leadership

Dr. King's staff consultant. In the fall

of 1962 he was promoted to acting

staff director in charge of voter regis-

tration and integration workshops.

During this period, O'Dell was a mem-

ber of the National Committee of the

homosexual King called "a brilliant,

efficient and dedicated organizer and

one of the best and most persuasive

interpreters of nonviolence." He was

secretary and advisor to King from

1956 to 1960, and went with him to

about the demonstrations that would

be started, the protest marches, the

American Negroes that we are no bet-

ter off than slaves. Wherever we went

and whatever we did, we were to pro-

mote race consciousness and resent-

ment, because the Communists know

that the technique of divide and con-

quer really works.

We were also told to promote Mar-

whites behind him, and to turn him

into some sort of national hero. We

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

August 15, 1977

Honorable Louis Stokes

Chairman

Eouse Select Committee on Assassinations

House of Representatives

Washington, D. C. 20515

475R27

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This is to confirm that pursuant to your request copies

of two memoranda concerning DI. Martin I. King, Jt., have been

supplied to your Committee's staff. These memoranda are

Memorandum dated 9 April 1976 for the Attorney General from

the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, and the

Nemorandum dated March 31, 1976, to the Assistant Attorney

General, Civil Rights Division, from the Chief, Criminal

Section of that Division.

The copies which have been provided have been excised to

protect highly sensitive national security information.

62-117290-45448

By memoranda dated June 6, 1977, and July 21, 1977, the

Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, has brought to my

attention certain matters which the FBI feels constitute

inaccurate or incomplete statements in these memoranda. In

Her are a collar i eluca an in enda, create

items are as follows:

44-38167-

"(1) Page 5, paragraph 2, REly memorándum - gtates

that the King investigation was continuously handled by sa

Seymor Phillips. Actually, Phillips' supervision of the case

ended in late 1965.

I AUG 24 1977

"(2) Page 34, Paragraph I, Murphy memorandum -contains

information regarding mail openings, which should be excised as

a sensitive investigative technique.

"(3) Paragraph 1, page 34, of the Murphy memorandum

contains a statement, "Electronic surveillance of the

Convention was widespread . . .' (Democratic Convention,

Atlantic City, New Jersey, August, 1964). The manner and

context in which this statement appears very strongly imply

that there was an electronic surveillance (by the FBI) on

the floor or elsewhere in the Auditorium where the Convention

took place. We know of no such electronic surveillance by

us or anyone else. In point of fact, the FBI did have two

electronic surveillances in effect in Atlantic City during

the period of the Convention. One was a telephone surveillance

on an individual at a hotel. • The other was a microphone

surveillance at a storefront jointly occupied by two organiza-

tions. We believe that the implication of an FBI electronic

surveillance at the Convention site is of such serious

significance that the facts in this matter should be brought

to the attention of the HSCA in any furnishing to it of the

Murphy memorandum.

"(4) Page 44, Paragraph 2, Murphy memorandum - states

that former Assistant Director William C. Sullivan took the

tapes and stationery and later gave Phillips a package to

deliver to SA Whitson. Phillips has no knowledge regarding

to whom this package was to be delivered. In addition, he

was unaware of the package contents or the purpose of

its

delivery.

"(5) Page 46, Paragraph I, Murphy memorandum - incor-

rectly states that SA Leinbaugh was the originator of the

Lorraine Hotel COINTELPRO activity.*

"(6) Page 9 of the Pottinger report contains a state- •

ment,

"The files reflect that the Bureau's action, especially

in mailing of the tape, •

..' (This refers to a mailing of

a tape to the King household in Atlanta, Georgia)• Erom

all records available at the FBI there appears to be no

doubt that a tape was mailed to the King family. There is

no record in our files, nor has any individual come: forward

with any information, to indicate that the mailing of the

tape was an official FBI action. Rather, the indication is

HH 55057 DocId: 32989750 Page 106

---

## Page 107

-3-

that the mailing of the tape was by an individual who was

then an Assistant Director of the FBI but with no indication

it was with the approval of any higher authority, including

the late Director, J. Edgar Hoover.

We have previously

indicated this position to the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities (Church Committee) and to the Depart-

ment. It is believed that our position relating to the mail-

ing of the tape should be made known to the HSCA in the event

it is furnished the Pottinger report."

Very truly yours,

Robert L. Keuch

Special Counsel to

the Attorney General

NOTE: The HSCA is interested in reviewing information con-

cerning the Louisville UKA and an Independent Klan Group,

Louisville, on an expedite basis.

The material is limited

because the HSCA restricted its request to the years 1965 and

1966.

The UKA was not established in Louisville until 1967

and the Independent Group did not come into existence until 1969.

Telephonic contact With Louisville confirmed SA Walsh as

the case Agent on Klan matters for the period 1965 through 1968.

Purpose of this communication showing partial response is

to comply with HSCA deadline.

Material to respond to

other items

in HSCA letters is being processed.

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: HSCA letter of 12/9/77; requested If any electronic

surveillance was conducted against four individuals and the

National States Rights Party (NSRP).

The HSCA only desired

confirmation as to the existence of

such electronic surveillance

and did not desire the

results of any surveillance.

The NSRP was subject of electronic surveillance during

5/6-7/59, (MISUR), Atlantic Hotel, Chicago, Illinois; 3/19-20/60,

(MISUR) ,

Midway Lodge, Miamisburg, 0h1o; 6/16/62, (MISUR),

Lasalle Hotel, Chicago, Illinois:

On 8/27/62, authority was granted for a microphone

surveillance of the NSRP, actually the rooms of Edward R. Fields

and J. B. Stoner, at the Whitley Hotel, Montgomery, Alabama.

June files of the

NSRP, Fields and Stoner do not show that this

surveillance was actually installed.

During our investigation concerning the desegregation of

the University of Alabama in 1963, authority was received

from

the Department to install technical coverage of the residence

of Fields and/or the NSRP Headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama,

and the residence of Stoner in Mableton, Georgia.

Installations

were not made, however, because telephone companies involved

were unable to insure complete security. (Bufile 157-778)

During our investigation into the church bombing (BAPBOMB)

in 1963, technical surveillance of NSRP Headquarters, actually

on 2/27/64, authority was grantea for microphone coverage

of the NSRP convention, Louisville, Kentucky, but no actual

installation was made for security reasons.

However, Installation

was made on the room of Fields at the Sheraton Hotel, Louisville.

Coverage was from 2/28/64, to 3/1/64. Authorization

was

specifically granted for Fields' room and not for the NSRP:

Except as outlined above, no additional electronic

surveillance was approved or conducted against Fields.

In addition to the above, Stoner was subject. of technical

surveillance during the BAPBOMB

Investigation.

This coverage

was from 10/10/63, to 2/28/64, at his residence In Atlanta.

The above review Is being reported in the event the HSCA

asks for additional information regarding these surveillances.

Information was obtained from review of June files of NSRP,

Stoner, Fields, BAPBOMB and desegregation of the University of

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: This responds to a request dated 11/3/77, from HSCA

for all information contained in Bureau files relative to

seventeen listed individuals.

This request has been

coordinated with the Legal Counsel Division.

A review of Bureau files has identified some main

files, references and ident records for eight of the seventeen

Individuals. None of the documents identified appear to have

any relationship to MURKIN.

on 11/19/77s Michael C. Eberhardt, Stall Counsel, HSCA,

was advised by SA John I. McGirl that a review of Bureau files

re Richard Yarbrough, one of the above listed individuals,

revealed that he was

listed along with eight other persons

the subject of two related ITAR matters (166-1570; 166-3249).

Yarbrough was the only subject of these two investigations

not indicted or convicted. Mr. Ebernardt advised, in view of

this fact, coupled with the fact it did not appear that these

Investigations would have any bearing on the HSCA's present

inquiry, it was not necessary for both of these files to be

prepared in their entirety for the Committee's access.

sure ten™

He

stated it would be sufficient to prepare only those documents

where reference is made to Yarbrough.

In accordance with HSCA's request and the agreement

reached with Mr. Eberhardt, retrievable documents in FBI

Headquarters file have been prepared for the Committee's access

and are being maintained by the Congressional Inquiry Unit.
