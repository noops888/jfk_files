MEMO :

FROM:

TO:

2/14/77

Fonzi

Tanenbaum

Enclosed are copies of a few things you might find of some

interest and would want for your files.

First there's a carbon of a brief interview I had with Reinaldo

PICO,

an admitted "former" CIA operative. He now works

for Max

Leshik at Replica.

He was in the original Watergate group but

did not participate in the break-in.

He also was among those

assigned to instigate the fracas during the Hoover funeral. In

passing, he puts Fiorinia and Hunt together during the

time of

the Bay of Pigs.

Next there's a copy of the arrest proceedings at No Name Key

and a list of those arrested.

As you know, a few escaped the

net, including Dick Watley and and Dennis Harber.

The former,

I suspect; is the guy with the Mohawk haircut who may be our

Odio connection, and the latter is the homosexual with right-wing

associates.

Also enclosed are some notes from talks with former FBI agent,

former Rampart's editor Bill Turner.

(Garrison suspects him

"of

being deep cover and, you'll notice, Turner doesn't mention in

his letter to Schweiker that he worked with Garrison for

a while.)

Turner touches on several points which, if so, may be significant.

He says those arrested at the New Orleans camp, including Sam

Benton, were connected

with Bosch.

Because of Bosch's connection

with Posada and Posada's with Bishop and Benton's with McClaney

"American adventurers"

the right circle here!

Another point to note in the Turner notes of 8/5/76 is the reference

to Karl McNabb whom, I'm told, is interested in

joining the Committee

staff. Turner is obviously close to McNabb. I found interesting

McNabb's former associations with both Bosch and the CIA.

I spoke with Garrison last night. He's still awaiting

our meeting,

but he'll be away next week.

wanted to check with him on Arcacha

Smith, the fellow. who ran the anti-Castro operation out of 544 Camp St.

Turns out Smith closed down the operation there a year before Oswald

arrived in New Orleans. Garrison now feels the hundreds of hours he

pu want remotetigating

Arcacha were a waste of time. He now feels

"He looked more significant than he was," he says.

The Arcacha lead was developed by Turner and Bill Barry,

a former

Miami News reporter who originally also broke the Milteer story and

whom I've been in touch with recently.

More to come on the No Name Key background.
