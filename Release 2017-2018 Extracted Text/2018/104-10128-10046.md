require Communications Intelligence in the performance of my official

duties, my right to see this material and have access to information

pertinent to it has ceased. Pursuant to the obligation which I incurred,

under oath, at the time of my indoctrination for Communications Intel-

ligence, I reaffirm that I will never hereafter divulge any information

which I have acquired as an authorized recipient or producer of Com-

munications Intelligence, nor discuss with any person any of the infer-

ences concerning Communications Intelligence which I have been enabled

(through knowledge acquired by me by virtue of that status )eto form, unless

and until freed from this obligation by unmistakable of categorical official

notice from authority competent in the premises.
