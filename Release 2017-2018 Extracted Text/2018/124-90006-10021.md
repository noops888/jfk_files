8 Re Chicago letter dated 3/3/77.

Enclosed for Chicago is a copy of an LHM dated 2/4/76
at Miami, entitléd "CERO, aka ZERO, IS -_CUBA.";yAlso enclosed
is a document dated July; 1965 from CIA, Le: ‘lassified
Secret. This document contains background information
concerning captioned individual.

AS enclosed LHM indicates, Organization ZERO was
first heard of in 1974 and claimed responsibility for the

in Miami in 1974. Since that time, so many ZERO letters have
been sent and received by Cuban exiles in Miami, that local
Police authorities and established informants are unable to
guess if there really was such an organization.

However, since TORRIENTE's death, there has not
been a murder claimed by or attributed to ZERO, although
there has been about a dozen leading Cuban exile political
and criminal figures murdered since 1974.

\m

Miami has spent.considerable time and effort
investigating Organization ZERO and has concluded that the
organization never did ‘exist and if it ever did exist, it.
did only one operation, that is.the murder of TORRIENTE.
