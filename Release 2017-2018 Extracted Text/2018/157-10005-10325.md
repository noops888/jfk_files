Dear Walt:

"Tis the time of year to put all thinga aright. In this
spirit let me run through « list of unrequited bits and pieces. .
Would you be so kind ae to provide the Committee with the
following:

1) A statement on the relationship of Humphrey Evans to the
Agency. Humphrey Evans is the author of The Thought
Revolution and Escape from Red China. Could you also
- provide us with information and/or files on Tung Chi-Ping
- and Robert Loh. Thase two men were the subject of
oe Humphrey's books.

2) Access to the files on the Vietnam Council on Foreign
ReZations. We would like to know the relationship, if
any, of the Agency to the Council including whatever
assistance the U.S. government may have provided to the
publication and distribution of the Viet Nam Magazine.

3) A statement from the Central Intelligence Agency on the
actual intelligence value of the information provided by |
Penkoveky. What did he tell the U.S. government that halt
didn't know? How valuable was that information? What
difference did it make?

4) Information on or access to the files on Lem Jones Associates,
Inc., of 280 Madison Avenue, Rew York, New York. This
firm released the various bulletins of the Cuban Revolu-
tionary Council in the 1960's,
