Within a few mautes si that con-

of liais, who said that he had subject and the other menuers of is party in custody

and offled se access to nin for whatever purposes I considered appropriate.

interrogated subject and 22 so to wat extent and aiong that lies.

He said tnat ne felt that the inpact of these messies would de very

great since it would make the people realize how serious the gore ment there viewed

the resignatica of a senior official cased on charges of Coummist tendencies in

the government. In defereece to these feelings on the part of ise subjest and being
