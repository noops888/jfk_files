Documentation of Castro Assassination Plots

REFERENCE:

Roview Staff 75/1696

1. Per referent request, we have conducted a reviow of our

Files on incidents and individuals mentioned in the report given

by Fidel Castro to Senator McGovern.

This memorandum contains

the results of our traces on the alleged assassination plots and

the Cuban individuals mentioned in the report. It must be borne

in mind that our files are keyed primarily to names of individuals

and not by incidents or plots, thereby making the retrieval process

difficult.

No project file bearing spocifically on the subject of

assassination has been located. Nonetheless, what follows is keyed

to the

chronological order of the plots as described in Castro's

report.

A. Mid 1960. Nothing has been located in records which

ties CIA

• to this incident.

(1) Armando CUBRIA Ramos. According to CIA traces,

CUBRIA was a long-time sabotage expert and member of Castro's 26th

of July Movement until 1960, when

he apparently turned on Castro.

He was arrested in 1960 for organizing underground activity

against the Castro regine and was

sentenced to 30 years imprison-

ment for conspiracy. There

is no record of CIA contact with CUBRIA.

(2) Mario TAULER Sague.

He was arrested on 12 July

1960 in Havana where he was caught unloading arms clandestinely

introduced into Cuba.

There is no record of CIA contact with him.

However Leopoldina GRAU MIsina was not arrested until 21 January

S. Mid 1965 and May 1966.

While some of the

individuals were considered for use by this and other USG

agencies, they were not ultimately employed by CIA and

available records indicate we were not connected with them

at the time the incidents occurred.

(1) Antonio CUESTA del Valle.

There is a 201

file on the individual. Ho was considered for use by clA

in early 1901 as a crewnan for a CIA vessel involved in

maritine operations.

The file does not reveal whether he

was actually used but all interest in him was terminated il

mid 1961. He was

subsequently reported to be

a leader o1

"Comandos L", a Miami-based anti-Castro exile organization.

He was captured in May 1966 after being wounded when his

group attempted to land a team of infiltrators near Havana.

CIA had no connection with the operation and the file does

not confirm that he was involved in an

assassination attempt

against Castro.

(2) Eugenio Enrique ZALDIVAR Cadenas. Thore is

a cut file on the individual, indicating an interest in hin

in April 1966 by another USG

agency. His file was closed

on

7 June 1966.

He is identified as a member of "Comandos I".

No further information is available.

(3) Sandelio Herminio DIAZ Garcia. There is

a 201 file on the individual.

The file was opened in

September 1957 because of his involvement with Honduran and

Costa Rican revolutionary activities.

He was debriefed by

a CIA case officer in Soptember 1963 as a Cuban refugee.

At that time he claimed to be in contact with anti-Castro

groups in Cuba and stated that he wanted to assassinate

Castro.

He indicated his intention to return to Cuba immediately.

We dropped contact with him at that time and never did have an

operationa. relationship with him.

In January 1966 he was

reported to be involved in a plan

by a Cuban emigre group to

infiltrate Cuba for the purpose of assassinating Castro.

On

30 May 1966 he was identified by Radio Havana as a member of

a commando group

killed while trying to land on the island.

However, in August 1973 an individual with the same name and

year of

birth was reportodly involved in narcotics trafficking

in Costa Kica.

A Cuban exile source stated that he believed

subject to be identical with the norcotics trafficker in

Costa

Rica. There is no further information to substantiate

this.

another USG agency.

ated following his arrest in Miami in January 1064 for illegal

use of narcotics and possossion of explosives and autonatic

weapons.

A review of files does not

confirm that CIA was involved in this incilent.

possible candidate for paramilitary operations against Cuba.

(1) Jesus DOMINGUEZ Benitez. No CIA traces on

subject were found.

2.

It is noted that the above totals twenty-one separate

analytical sections whereas there are actually twenty-four

alleged

assassination attempts.

This is due to the fact that

the analyses of the two incidents of 20 July 1961 have been

combined

since they both occurred on the sane day and were

allegedly executed by the same groug.

The treatmont of the

alleged June 1965 poisoning attempt is part of the analysis

of the mid 1964 incident because the

alleged pepetrator is

relatés to the group described therein.

of assassination.

It is notod that one case is currently

being reviewed by a SSC staff member for selection of documents

to be sanitized.

This case (Rolando CUBELA Secades) was not

reviowed in connoction with this memorandun.

Of the twenty-

three cases reviewed, nothing has been found to substantiate

the charges
