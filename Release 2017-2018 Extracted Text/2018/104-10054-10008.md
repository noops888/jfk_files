“ACTION REQUIRED)
Reference: HMMW~13207, 14 December 1964

1. Attached by split transmission is an outline for Project LIONION
covering the services of the two agents heretofore known es LIFEUD-22

(201-288248) and LIFEVD-23 (201-305604). This project was anticipated in
paragraph 4, vege-9 of the LIRANCH project outline trensmitted by Reference,

2. To avoid re-typing at Headquarters the Station has taken the liberty
of provisionally assigning eryptonyms LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 to these agents.
Please advise if this is correct.

Identification, This is a technical (primarily photogrephic) surveillance
operation against the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

Objectives. The operation is designed to (1) furnish photographic coverage
during daylight hours of the entrances of the target installation, (2)
dispatch physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the
target, ena (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring ana
recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

‘The target installation is the PERUMEN Embassy compound (including
Consulate} in Mexico City. The above-listed objectives are accomplished by
‘two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street from
the target.

The project is in consonance; with Priority A, Objective 1, of the
current Related Mission Directive) for Mexico.

Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the first time,
does not represent a new operation. LIONION activity has been going on since
1962 and costs have heretofore beén charged to PERUMEN FI funds. The
operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PERUMEN Enbassy,
both staff end visitors. These photographs are normally reviewed for identi-
fications by the PERUMEN section at the Station, then shown separately to
LEGAMIL-9 and LUfaMit-7;who are
They are cubsequently forvardea tO the CI section of WH/SA where they are shown
to PBRUMEN intelligence defectors {ANNIP-1 and AMMUG-1. Of those assets to whom
they are routinely shown, LITAMIL‘9) has to date made the largest number of
identificstions. The photos have|proven of great value. Within hours of the
arrival of 2 new Eubassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the
Station, In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos
(accompanied by a log kept by the/LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action
(arrivals end departures) and detAils of personal associations (vho associates
with whoa) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against
the target.

In addition to photography, LICNION-1 and LIONION-2 are. often called upon
to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIONION-1 is essentiel
to the dispetching of the LIEZMBRACD surveillance team against individuals
associated with the target. Because of the presence of police patrol cars in
; the Station's mobile surveillance essets’ cannot come close to- ty
hence the need for LIONION-1'5 dispatching services. ae

The presence of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 also insures continued occupancy of
a valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the
Station sicceeds in installing additional technical surveillence devices in the
target i ‘orm of concealed radio transmitters.

Operational Assets (Personnel). '

LIONION-1 is a young PERUMEN lawyer in exile. He left PBRUMEN in 1960,
plaming to continue on via Mexico to the United States where he resided in
his early years. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer
in the Department of Commerce in Washington, the other a police official in ;
Tampa, Florida. While in Mexico LIONION-1 was recruited, as LILILY-1, to
perform PERUMEN operational support services for the Station and, once having
a@ taste of clandestine activity, decided to remain in Mexico. LIONION-2,|

was recruited in 1961, as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and
operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE technical operation aimed at the PERUMEN
Bubassy. At this same time LIONION-1 also phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and
the two worked together as e team. In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked.
together in processing the take of the LIFEAT/LIERODE/MMRAP installation, now
kmown es LIGMEN. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-1 and
2 to LiFS0D-22 end 23, respectively. In the latter part of 1962 the two agents
begen the present photographic surveillence operation.

LIOGNIOB-1 was granted an OA on 18 May 1962 by HMMW~10664, He was
LCFLUTTERED on 8 October 1963, HMMW-1206).

LIONION-2 was granted an OA on 16 May 1962 by HMMW~10660. ~

LIONION-1 is the mainstay of the operation. LIONION-2 acts as his assistant
and fill-in at such times es he is absent from the observation post. Both serve
principally as observers and photographers. LIONION-1 also acts as a dispatcher
for the LIEMBRACE surveillence team from which he is compartmented. Dispatching
is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not
know LIONION-1 or his precise location. LIONION-1 also processes on the premises
ell photographic coverage of the main Hnbassy gate through final printing, cropping
and mounting. Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through the
negative develomment stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of
the agents, that as PERUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might
Ye: brought upon them by KUBARK through the Mexican goverrment should they get out
of line. Motivation is a combination of financial necessity and violent aversion
to, and decermination to bring about the downfall of, the AMTHUG regime. An
additional uotivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what for many would
be monotonous vork. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of work,

i
Commmication is primarily with LIONION-1; with LIONION-2 only in his
absence. Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls
fron LIONION-1 go through @ telephone cut-out), are usually hela at the
LIONION-1 sefe apartment. This apartment, which vould appear to be a LIONION-L
love nest, is in another area of town. ‘The Station KURIO? technician,
Hugh T. FRANCOPTE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week. The Case Officer,
Lawrence F. BARKER, meets with him less frequently. Whereas LIONION-1 knows
the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOTTE's true identity.

Security Evaluation, If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican
authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMHAVE
area on.a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering
their income. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in f°

with the KURIO? automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such
refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.
In any event, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with en official of the Mexican
president's office. This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,
enabled hin to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome any

. future difficulties with Mexican authorities.

Under Mexican law, the principal (photographic) activity of the project is
not illegal, therefore uncovering of the photographic operation vould not of.
itself result in arrest or prosecution. It is usually possible to stave off
investigation or house search for a period of time sufficient to remove compromis-
ing material from the premises, The LIONION, base house was once cleaned completely

in one evening and could again be cleaned, probably in less time, if circumstances
should werrant. ~

The target installation is aware that photo surveillance is a probability.
(m one occasion AMKNOB-1l, a JMWAVE asset, was shown a nearby building (not the
LIONION bese) by a PHRUMEN Embassy officer and told that it was a KUBARK photo
base.
i

LIONION-1 is known by sight to some PERUMEN Hubassy staff personnel who have
observed him in the neighborhood. ‘Presumably they believe he is a Mexican. To
avoid operational compromise, he cannot renew his expired passvort at the
PSRUMEN Consulate. For this reason the Station will request KURIO? in separate
correspondence to prepare new passports for both LIONION agents so that they may
travel outside Mexico.

Security measures employed in this operation are-designed to-make-it virtually
iagossible for any opposition service to link LIONION personnel with the Station.
