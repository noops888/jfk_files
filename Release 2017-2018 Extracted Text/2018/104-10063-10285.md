MICROFILM

As you will note in paragraph 7 of the Reference, we

asked (SMABOVE to give us compiled information that they have on

various MHCHAOS targets.

At the time they said that these con-

tained their own internal source information and could not be

passed.

They promised, however, to furnish us the same material

in a form that could be passed.

The attached two books entitled

'"The Black Power Movement In Canada" and 'Unrest in the Academic

¡Community (Canada)!' were recently passed to us in response to

this request.

From a cursory review of the material it appears that

some of it is already known to you

Some is overt information

while other items reflect results of SMABOVE investigations/and

thorough checking.

we are also attaching \SMABOVE's letter of

transmittal which updates some of the information. You will note

that they invite our comments.

We feel that this is somewhat of a break through with

(SMABOVE. We have not received this kind of complete report from

them recently.

We intend very soon to offer some comments to

them and especially offer our appreciation. Your comments also

would be appreciated.

Look Me do not to do not tie cas also eaten these

We assume they were not. If we determine that they were

passed to LNERGO we will let you know.

uring August 1968, the International Assembly of Revolutionary

cudents in New York during September 1968, and the Hemispheric

1968.

As suggested earlier, protests and student demands in

the academic community in the name of student power are not 1n-

digenous to Canada.

There is a reinforcing relationship between

she protest movements of each specific Western country due mainly

co the international outlook of protest leaders who are prone to

react to similar protest movements in other countries.

Although

there äre numerous contacts between student power leaders and

activists in various countries, and foreign events do have.

substantial evidence of coordinated international control.

2. INFLUENCE OF FOREIGNERS

LIVING IN CANADA

There has always been a number of academics from foreign

countries who have come to Canada to take up positions in the

academic community.. Although there are exceptions, in the past most

of these people have tended to be concerned only with their

academic endeavours and have not openly participated in the

political affairs of this country.

years there has been do ma

students, graduate students and professors - who have come to

Canada and

become actively involved in the protest movements, in

particular, the Student Power movement.

Many of these people fall

in the New Left category and have come to Canada due to ditficulties

with their own governments because of their radical political

activities.

It is quite apparent that much of the unrest'on Canadian

campuses to date has been strongly influenced, and in certain

instances initiated, by radical students and

professors from other

countries.

Many of

the radicals involved in the upheaval at SFU,

sor example, were lecturers and teaching assistants of British and

American origin who were virtually persona non grata to. their

immigrated to Canada.

ind author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up

employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political

Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA).

BOTTOMORE, as head of

the PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a

British citizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl

Mordecai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA

Department after BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has

expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to keep

his hand in on the hiring.

Professor Donald E. EPSTEIN of the Political Science

Department at the University of Waterloo, an American citizen

described as a draft dodger and an SDS member prior to his arrival

in Canada in 1967, as previously indicated, has been active in

organizing and directing students in tactics and methods by which

they could take physical possession of university buildings.

EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at

raterloo, has apparently been refused tenure at that University

the administration in this regard.
