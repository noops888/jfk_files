Reference; “OCOA-14721, 30 September 1969

1. As you will note in paragraph 7 of the Reference, we
asked(SMABOVE: to give us compiled information that they have on
various MHCHAOS targets. At the time they said that these con-
tained their own internal source information and could not be
passed, They promised, however, to furnish us the same material
in a form that could be passed, The attached two;books entitled~

"The Black Power Movement in Canada" and "Unrest. in the Academic
Community (Canada)"" were recently passed to us in response to
this request,

2. From a cursory review of the material it appears that
some of it is already known to you, Some is overt information
while other items reflect results of(SMABOVE investigations/and
thorough checking, We are also attaching \SMABO| 's/letter of
transmittal which updates some of the informati You will note

that they invite our comments,

_ 3. We feel that this is somewhat of a break through with
(SMABOVE. We have not received this kind of complete report from
thém recently, We intend very soon to offer some comments to
them and especially offer our appreciation, Your comments also
would be appreciated.

_. 4 We do not know for sure if LNERGO was also given these
Spooks,’ We assume they were not. If we determine that they were

passed to LNERGO we will let you know.

vents where these contacts were made including the CUS and UGEQ
nnual conferences, the Ninth World Youth Festival in Bulgaria
uring August 1968, the International Assembly of Revolutionary
igudents in New York during September 1968, and the Hemispheric
ye edna to End the War in Vietnam in Montreal during December
368.

As suggested earlier, protests and student demands in
she. academic community in the name of student power are not in-
digenous to Canada. There is a reinforcing relationship between
she protest movements of each specific Western country due mainly
so the international outlook of protest leaders who are prone to
ceact to similar protest movements in other countries. Although
chere are numerous contacts between student power leaders and
activists in various countries, and foreign events do have an
effect on events in Canada, there is not, at least as yét, any
substantial evidence of coordinated international control. This
is not to say that such control doesn't exist (it could, for
axample, be exercised from a student radical hotbed such as West
cermany}, but thus far the student protest movement appears to
have spread more by imitation and publicity than by coordinated
planning.

2. INFLUENCE OF FOREIGNERS
LIVING IN CANADA

There has always been a number of academics from foreign
countries who have come to Canada to take up positions in the
academic community. Although there are exceptions, in the past most
of these people have tended to be concerned only with their
academic endeavours and have not openly participated in the
political affairs of this country. However, during the past several
years there has been a gradual increase in the number of academics -
students, graduate students and professors - who have come to
Canada and become actively involved in the protest movements, in
particular, the Student Power movement. Many of these people fall
in the New Left category and have come to Canada due to difficulties
| with their own governments because of their radical political

activities.

It is quite apparent that much of the unrest‘on Canadian
campuses to date has been strongly influenced, and in certain
instances initiated, by radical students and professors from other
countries. Many of the radicals involved in the upheaval at SFU,
for example, were lecturers and teaching assistants of British and

{ ' American origin who were virtually persona non grata to.their
native countries educational institutions and hoe as a result,
immigrated to Canada.

Approximately half of the faculty staff of the PSA
Department, which was the focal point from which the demands for
change in the University structure emanated prior to the formation

lapparently, the U.S. Government has been given what officials
consider "ironclad proof" that Communist China and Cuba have
Lntand finance natianally coordinated campus disorders.

x the SDU at SFU, consists of left-wing activists? in this
sategory. Martin LONEY, who was one of the student leaders
iuring the SFU incident, entered Canada as a British citizen in
august 1966. Dr. Thomas Burton BOTTOMORE , a leading Marxist

and author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up
employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political
Science, Sociology and Anthropology (PSA). BOTTOMORE, as head of
vhe PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a
Sritish eitizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl
LEGGEIT, Hathan POPKIN and Martin NICOLAUS, all U.S. citizens.

Although the largest concentration of foreign radicals
at SFU was. in the PSA, other activists did take positions in
other departments... Phese included Sidney COONTZ, Michael Allan
LEBOWITZ, Paul Edward IVORY, and Maurice HALPERIN, all U.S.
citizens, and Laughlin Bernard CURRIE, a citizen of Colombia.

Mordecai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA
Department after BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has
expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to keep iywa
his hand in on the hiring. In this regard, Gerald SPERLING is, “*~
through BRIEMBERG, making efforts to get Malcolm SYLVERS, an American
Marxist university professor who apparently worked for the Communist
underground in Italy during the early 1960's, into SFU.

Professor Donald E. EPSTEIN of the Political Science
Department at the University of Waterloo, an American citizen
described as a draft dodger and an SDS member prior to his arrival
in Canada’ in 1967, as previously indicated, has been active in
organizing and directing students in tactics and methods by which
they could take physical possession of university buildings.
EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at
saterloo, has apparently been refused tenure at that University
and there are indications that activist students intend to challenge
the administration in this regard.

Professor Norman STRAX ,* an American who was employed
as an Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of New
Brunswick, precipitated the crisis at that University. STRAX was
instrumenta] in the formation and activities of the SDS branch at
that point..
