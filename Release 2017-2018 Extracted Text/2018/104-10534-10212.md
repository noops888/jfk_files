and Rudolf Fernandes:

...;

Declassified and Approved for Release

by the Centrar intelligence Agency

Date: 2:003

1. On 4 Novenaber MI. J. Patrick Goyae, Staff Director of

the President's Board of Consultunts on Foreign Intelligence Activities,

brougat to sce mo Mr. Charles Murphy, formerly personal assiatant, to

xesident truman, and Mx. H. Graham: Morison; lorierly with the

Department: of Juntice, who are now partners in the flins of Morison,

Murphy, Glapp: & Abrams. Coyne left these gentlemen with me and they

proceeded to tell me of discussions they hare been baving with

DI. Nanez Portouondo and Rudolf Fcruandez., These Cabans were:.:

apparently pat in touch with Morison through a mutual friend, Mi. Gilleaple,

President of Dixie Industries Corporation in Atlanta, Georgia.

Fernandes is reported to be a resident of Tampa, Florida, and Atlanta

wacre he kaows GilLespie. (Apparently L O5

Thas been t fairly active

nource of the FBl in Atlanta, and states that de has given them many

reports on activities in Cuba by the anti-Castro underground. These

include a report which the FBI has disseminated, according to Murphy,

that a colonel in the MVD (as reported) was atill active in Cuba.

The proposition that the Cubans bave put to these Washington

lawyers is to the effect that they would like ansurance that the United

States Government will not intervene should thay aucceed in mounting a

military expedition in Gustemala to proceed to Cuba to attempt to over

throw the Castro regime. Apparently Portouondo bas stressod the fact

that they will not abuse the hoapitality of the United Stated, and will stage

'all of their operations outside of this country. He alleges that he has the

support of sevoral other Latin American countrles, and that there are a .

considerable sumber of Cuban exiles who will respond to his initiative.

â€¢ Among those mentionad were fnu Martinez in Florida and Gen. Tabernilla

in the Dominican Republic. Accordiag to Portouondo, if something is

not done soon about the situation in Cuba, the government will be com-

pletely under Communist control within a few monthu. He alleges that

there are 200. Russians and 300 Chinese actively at work organizing the

Communista in Cuba. The question put to me by Messra. surphy and

Morison was what should they do, TEnnything, with Portonondo; should

they agree to represent him and, if so, should they register as sopresent-

lag foreign interests and request that such registration be kept confidential?

3. Mesars. Murphy and Morison went an to state that they

understood that representatives of the ten corporations which have the

Iargest interests in Cuba are planniag to mobilize Congressional pressure

on the Department of State to do something about it. They stated that

these corparations felt there was little use in going to the Department of

State or to Secretary Rubottom because they would get the classic answer

that the United States does not interfere ln the internal affairs of a

sovereign power. They also said that they felt there should be one focal

point in the Government for people like Portouondo and these corporations

to deal with--not in the Department of State.

4. I thanked these gentlomen for their information and told,

them I would place it in the hands of experts and see what guidance we.

could give them. I pointed out that we were constantly being appioached

by Caband and repeatedly gave them the advice that this was a Cuban"

:1,

aliair and that they were the ones who whoald do something. I pointed

out to them that Portoundo's proposal sounded somewhat naive Innamuch

as Cantro appeared to have the support of the bulk of the people and has

threatened to arm the Campesinos if there wan eny threat of external

tavasion. I also said that the slightest indication of U.S. Invalvement

woald have extreme adverse effects in thin country.

Would you let me know it your earliest convenience what

advice I thould' give to these gentlemen,

or whether you would like to be

put directly ia touch with them?
