in Youngstown; Ohio, and that he stayed at TONY's home for a

while there.

was too safe for him in Cuba:

VALENTI, JOHN LA ROCCA, SAM MANNARINO and ANTONIO RIPERI

dealing with VALENTI but tried to hold up VALENII for more

efforts to pressure him in this regard by having them murdered

in a sarage. T-l2 stated that he was involved inasmüch as he

had furnished the guns which had been used. He advised that he

broke off his connections with VALENTI, LA ROCCA and others

in about 1953. He said he has since furnished information to

Immigration and Naturalization Senice, Treasuny and FBI

regarding these individuals.

would not be worth much in Pittsburgh beeause of what he has

said about VALENTL, LA ROCCA and others' with whom he was

previously associated.

deceased, who had handled cases involving VALENIT and his

associates and that this individual also handled a coin machine

manufacturing concern in Chicago which was named the Filben

Corporation, T-12 said he believed that this attorney might

have been even higher up in the mob than VALENII and LA ROCCA.

SAMUEL MANNANINO at the ken iron and suee. Combys on

September 3/ 1958; MANNARINO authorized him to locate a group of

responsible

New Kensington residents who might be interescec

in forming aprivate club to take over the management of the

Lakeview Recreation Area on a long term lease.

According to T-14, MANNARINO 1s particularly

interested in having a group of approximately 100 people who

would be willing to lease the recreation area tor $5,000 a

year with MANdAnto retaining the concession rights to the

restaurant.

T-14 explained that apparently MANNARINO does

not feel that the state of his health le such that he can

bear up under the responsibilities of managing the establishment

and that by leasing the business he could assure himself of a

substantial inancial return wichout being sacred wich the

responsibilities of the business.

T-14 stated that he gathered from their convesation

that MANNARINO has cancelled the Ilquor license in the Lakeview

Recreation Area restaurant and has made arrangements with the

Ilquor Control Board whereby the same Ilcense will be transferred

to a new location approximately 300 or 400 yards from the

Lakeview Recreation Area where MANNARINO is having the Murin

and Florina Construction Company build a new cocktail lounge.

plan to actually go ahead with the construction of the motel

was complaining

about a terrible hangover and mentioned that he got drunk

with GABRIEL MANNARINO during

the evening of September 15

or the morning of september 16, 1958.

'T-9 said that SAMS

also told him that MANNARINO has been back in New Kensington

since early september and is very unhappy about the lack of

business in the gambling casino and the general pressure being

brought to bear on New Kensington by Federal investigative

agencies. I-9 said that SAMS aid not go into any further

detal regarding his drinking bout with MANNARINO and 0-9

considered it inadvisable to press him at the risk of

appearing to be too. inquisitive.

áll probability, SAMS and MANNARINO aid their drinking on

September 15 or 16, 1958, at the Laetus glub on Fifth Avenue,

next door to the Triangle Billlards gambling

casino, 1-9 noted that SaMs follows a strict daily routine

which Includes being at the Laetus Club to supervise the

MANNARINO sport betting operation usually until one or two

in the morning evory day except Sunday and he seriously doubted

whether MANNARINO would risk drinking at any other establishment

providing, of course, they did not go to one of their homes.

1-9 assumed that MANNARINO probably entered the Laetus Club

through the rear door on Bares Street. and spent the evening

with SAMS drinking in the Laetus Club since the management

of

that club would not betray MANNARINO nor would the local

police.
