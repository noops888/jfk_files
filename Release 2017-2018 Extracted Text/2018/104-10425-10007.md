MEMORANDUM FOR CI/RMO

SUBJECT: Response

to FOI Request 75-150

1. The Agency's response to Paul L. HOCH's request

for certain records in the OSWALD case should contain the

following points:

MT. HOCH should be informed that Warren

Commission Documents (CD) 347 and 384 cannot be doclass1-

fiod in whole or part at this time due to the continued

sensitivity of sources and the revelation of our nethods

of operating.

b.

The attachment to CD 1287 which is an affi.

davit of MT. Helms was previously released to the public

domain and is availablo at National Archives. We have

reviewed the menorandum which transmitted the affidavit

and conclude that it, too, can be declassified.

Mr.

Hoch is welcome to a copy of the transmittal memorandum

and to the affidavit.

Per MI. Hoch's discussion regarding CD 631

which was proviously released to the public domain in

1973, we should also explain to him that the description

of the man in that CD is not of OSWALD but of the unidenti

fied man in the photograph which was later show to OSWALD'

mother.

We should resterate to MT. Hoch that when we

furnished to the FBI the photograph of the unidentified

man, we had no photograph of lee Harvey OSWALD. Our

assumption that the unidentified man in the photograph

was OSMALD wAS an efor which can be attributed only to

the sense of urgency of the noment and the excitemant

prevailing at the tine of the assassination.

The unidenti

fied man in the photograph remains unidentified.

The

personal description that was furnished was also in error

and did not pertain to Lee Harvey OSWALD. It was, of course,

the description of the midentified nan.

d. Mr. Hoch should also be advised that the

inforation no furnished to the Warren Connission on the

Albert Schweitzer College and OSWALD's relationship with

that school, as based on CD 321 and CD 818, 1s noz classI

fied and is Included in the Narren Commission's report,

Voluse XVI, pp. 621 - 637. The Commission's report, as a

matter of fact, contains even more information than we had

on that school.

We shall be pleased to furnish Mr. Hoch

the data pertaining to the school in the for of excerpts

fTon CD 321 and CD 818, 1f he wishes.

2.

The infornation on the Lapruder filn which Mr.

Hoch requested is in the possession of the Pictorial

Services Branch of CRS and they have been notified that a

response from then will no doubt be requested through

regular FOl channels.
