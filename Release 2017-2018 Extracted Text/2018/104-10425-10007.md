MEMORANDUM FOR CI/RMO
SUBJECT: Response to FOI Request 75-150

1. The Agency's response to Paul L. HOCH's request
for certain records in the OSWALD case should contain the
following points:

a. Mr. HOCH should be informed that Warren
Commission Documents(CD) 347 and 384 cannot be declassi-
fied in whole or part at this time due to the continued --
sensitivity of sources and the revelation of our methods
ef operating.

b. The attachment to CD 1287 which is an affi-
davit of Mr. Helms was previously released to the public
domain and is available at National Archives. Wo have
reviewed the memorandum which transmitted the affidavit
and conclude that it, too, can be declassified. Mr.
Hoch is welcome to a copy of the transmittal memorandum
and to the affidavit.

c. Per Mr. Hoch's discussion regarding CD 631
which was previously released to the public domain in
1973, we should also explain to him that the description
of the man in that CD is not of OSWALD but of the unideati-
fied man in the photograph which was later shown to OSWALD's
mother. We should reiterate to Mr. Hoch that when we
furnished to the FBI the photograph of the unidentified
man, we had no photograph of Lee Harvey OSWALD. Our
assumption that the unidentified man in the photograph
was OSWALD was an error which can be attributed only to
the sense of urgency of the moment and the excitement

prevailin at the time of the assassination. The unidenti-

fied man in the photograph remains unidentifiea. The
personal description that was furnished was also in error
and did not pertain to Lee Harvey OSWALD. It was, of course,
the description of the wmidentified man.

: d. Hr. Hoch should also be advised that the
information we furnished to the Warren Commission on the
Albert Schweitzer College and OSWALD's relationship with
that school, as based on CD 321 and CD 818, is not classi-
fied and is included in the Warren Commission's report,
Volume XVI, pp. 621 - 637. The Commission's report, as a
matter of fact, contains even more information than we had
on that school. We shall be pleased to furnish Mr. Hoch
the data pertaining to the school in the form of excerpts
from CD 321 and CD 818, if he wishes.

2. The information on the Zapruder film which Mr.
Hoch requested is in the possession of the Pictorial
Services Branch of CRS and they have been notified that a
| response from them will no doubt be requested through
regular FOI channels.
