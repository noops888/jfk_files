JFK

As shown in my memorandum of 12-13-77, the Bureau

identified some of the materials in the KENNEDY investigation

which were released on 12-7-77 as those which apparently

attracked the attention of at least one reporter from a

Mexican newspaper in Washington.

Ambassador's Assistant, was in Washington the following

weekend and brought back with him three separate sections

which had been furnished to him at the Bureau.

represent the 524 page report of former SA WARREN C. DE

BRUEYS at Dallas on 12-8-63. One section, pages 315 - 359,

relates to the Mexican travel of LEE HARVEY OSWALD. To date,

there have been no articles of a sensational nature appearing

in the Mexican press based on this material.

In addition, on 1-5-78,

Sought

to this office a set

of documents which had been torwarded

by his Headquarters which appeared to represent raw Bureau

file material pertaining to the Mexican aspects of the OSWALD

investigation.

At his suggestion, copies of thesedocument?

were made for temporary retention

in the files of this office

and the set furnished byl

-(6) returned to him on 1-6-78.

For the time being, all of this material is being

placed in a Bulky Exhibit Envelope of captioned file so

that it will be available for reference if needed.
