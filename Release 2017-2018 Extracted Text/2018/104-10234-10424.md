1. Nooting /Tine/Place/Purpose. This meeting was held
in the offices roa 0 until 1130 and from 1230
until 1515, Lunch was taken at the office, It is noted that

was to identify one Alberto BLANCO Romariz, who had arrived
. Om the scene in Madrid claiming to have a zessage from AMLASB/1,
"amd to provide the necessary defensive briefing.

2. Details of Heoting.

i &. Alberto BLANCO Romariz - Through a telephone call

H to AMLASH72 in Madrid, AWWHIP/1 determined that BLANCO was

{ fn fact "El Loco Blanco”, who was expected some time last
Spring to bring out a message from AMLASH/1,. This rested
our minds somewhat as it had been thought that it was
possible Alberto BLANCO Romariz might have been a DGI
attempt to establish the fact beyond doubt that AMLASH/1
was in touch with KUBARK, AMWHIP/1 was instructed to pro-
ceed with caution in any discussions with BLANCO, and not
to acknowledge the fact that he and AMLASH/1 were in fact
in touch with KUBARX. This restriction could be changed
ag he -vas ‘certain of BLAKCO's bona fides and checked with
the Station first. (See cable traffic in AMWHIP/1 and

> AMLASH/1 files.)

b. AMLASH/2 ~ A/2 is currently staying with Jose Luis
GonzaLnz, Gallarret , Attache of Cuban Embassy, Madrid
(telephone 273-9637, According to AKWHIP/1, GUNZALEZ
7? Gas tae Ly mown by hia, matronymic Geierres a, is
‘omaunist, friendly to AMLASH/1, a friend of ‘AMLASH/2's

and who can be trusted to a reasonable degree (at least
to the point of not willingly compromising AMLASH/1).

j to AMWHIP, ALVAREZ who was usually known by his first

: name Odon, is also anti-Communist or at least anti-

H regime, and can be trusted to the same degree as

¢. Luis SOTO Andraca, Vice-Rector of the University

of Havana, When queried, KUWHIP stated that he did so

) whO was mentioned in the operational traffic
from Madrid as being fully witting of AMLASH's Plans
(this according to statement by Aéberto BLANCO in Madrid).
, AMNHIP stated he thought he knew a Luis SOTO but did not
f recall any details about the man, nor could he identity
this man with the Subject Luis soTo.

d. A Letter from Jose de Jesus JIRJAUMA to Carlos

H ZARRAGA, etter In question was received by GA
1 _ From JINJAUMA, stated that certain dissident and pri-
marily DR types vere ready to take action against Castro
Provided their personal safety and future means of sub-
Sistence were guaranteed. It named AMWHIP/1'a friend Ei
Marcelo (Harzo) ARTIME Vega as the channel for trans- 4
mittal of these guarantees, ZARRAGA,'@& recalled, is a
former JURE member who had recently resigned. The people
. - ‘involved in the letter, in addition to JINJAUMA, were

identified as follows:

Captain (fnu) GIRON, i”
Luis FERRANDEZ de 1a Camara (member of Fidel's Personal

i bedy guard)
Guillermo (Bi11ikbgq)

Garcia RIESTRA

AMLASH/1

i Tony CASTELLE
Faure CHOMON

In discussing the letter with AMMHIP/1, he stated that
it was quite likely that this letter was legitimate and,

Was unlikely that AMLASH/1 would have himself required
such guarantees. (C/O Comment: We report this as told
| to us by AMWHIP/1 but do feel that due to the closeness

i of AMMHIP/1 and AMLASH/1, AMWHIP/1 may be allowing

H | AMLASH/1 the benefit of the doubt in this case.)

: 5’ AMWHIP/1 stated that be knew all of the poople in

i we 4 the letter oxcept Captain (fnu) GIRON. He stated

iG 4 that dt had beon quite Likely for JINJAUMA to write

i Gant toGallerretta as thoy had been, as were all the

ame ‘ethers mentioned in the letter, had=-seen menbers of
the.old -UIR group which functioned as a counter=

“terrorist element against Batista’s first regime circa

i
ve 1944, AMVHIP/1 stated that, in fact, Fidel Castro
ik himself had been a member of the UIR. AMMHIP further

n

stated that there was no dcubt in his mind that Fidel,

i Imoving these men as he did, was well aware of their

} antagonism towards his regime. Other members of the

i VIR which AHWHIP/1 could recall were as follows:

,

H , 1; Marin DAPICO Antonio ‘ ‘

| Sandel Herminio Blaz (friend of AYMEGEIRAS)

H 90209)

j Jesus DIEGUEZ (presently in Miami)

two PARSONS brothers (presentiy in Miami «

i Other data unknown)

{ ZARRAGA of course was also a member of the UIK. AMWHIP/1
1 stated thet the most influential menbers of this group
were had been JINJAUMA, Fernandez de 1m CAMARA,
Billiking, and possibly Marin DAPICO. AMHHIP/12 stated
that these people were action types and were reasonably
close®#-knit so far as their loyalty to each other and
fim turn the organization was concerned.

e@. AMWHIP/1 was also asked to elicit from AMLASH/2
any information which the latter might have concerning
Cuban officials with their hands "in the till" or other-
wise knocking down on the Governnent, and/or putting money
away in foreign banks.

3. Finances.

AMWHIP/1 was given a token gift of a box of 50 cigars
in appreciation for the amount of time he freely devotes to

Laureano ALVAREZ (presently in N.Y.C., Tel. LUdlow

KUBARK business. He reluctantly accepted the sum of $500 against
his ops exrenses in the past and for the coming trip to Europe.
It was thought, by the wagy Heal $1000 or more would have been

@ much more yealistic figure to have given him, Howeverg as he
bas alvays pte in the past, he is reluctant to accept money for
bis services or for his expenses inc .rred. on. KUBARK's behalf.

He did admit, however, that he would probably again be touched
for a “lean" by AMLASH/2 and as he laughingly stated these “loans”
wi habituall: 2n.24/ forever. We also estimated that the
Various transsc: Le Fucus calls he has made in his.behalf, the. -
expenses he will incur in entertaining AMLASH/2, Robe: BLANCO,
UNSNAFU/19 and others will easily exceed the $500 he has ry
advanced. A signed receipt was obtained.

4. Security Gilbert

There wore no incidents of a security nature to report
8B stated above. There were very few people in the offices due
to the fact that today was You Kippgr.
