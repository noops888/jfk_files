And then the question is whether or not there is a prohi-'
bition on printing in the English language.

Mr. Bader. And as I heard the consensus this morning,
we would not move to that recommendation: for a prohibition.
I did_not hear whether pall the distribution this would be by.
law, though I took it it was to be by law,. though I can be
corrected on that. I don't think we addressed that this morning.

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, on these that we considered

to be rather -~ that we have a fairly light record on or that

we are not too sure what the future holds, one of the members

that I rode over with on’ the car suggested that perhaps inf thos: 2
instances we could recommend fairly strongly whatever we ane
the followon people to do to ensure that the recommendation
does not create havoc Tiehin the Agency or does not leave the”
rights of citizens unprotected.

But that is not a cop out. It is something that you
frequently do, say, let us reserve this for the permanent
oversight committee or for whatever other group. We may have
all the information we need.

Senator Huddleston. Let them make the determination eae fe

working all right under the set of regulations.

Senator Huddleston; I call the Committee to order.

Mr. Aaron. I beliéve Bill Bader had the temerity: to
summarize where we stand.

Mr. Bader. Mr. Chairman, where I think we are at the
moment is. taking the three major issues before the Subcommittee
in the order they were prccented: na discussed this morning,
the first being the academic issue, and as-I heard the Subcom-
mittee this morning, then I will have another go at. the
options, give enough options in the option paper and bring: it

back before the Committee for a further look before we go gn.

Senator Huddleston. By Friday.

Mr. Bader. By Friday, without question.

i

include a. positive option, that is. to.say,.to.approve if not
i

applaud the expanded efforts of RD to undertake these activi- |
ties, or at .least .to endorsé .them,

Now, going to the second was the covert use of books and
publishing houses. We discussed two recommendations: one which
I believe here the Committee has agreed to, and that is a
prohibition on the distribution or subsidy of any books,
magazines or other publications not attributed’ to the CIA in-
q

side the United States.!

Senator Huddleston. I think we can all accept that, can't

and inquiry into it has ‘been thorough, and I think we know this
well. There is no dispute from the Agency.

Senator Huddleston, Well, is the law inconsistent with
the statute ‘on the information service?

Mr. Bader. It is the same thing. I would recommend,
Mr. Chairman, that this would be by law, by statute.

Mr. diGenova. The John McCloy exceptions to that rule, they
are the only ones that are protected.

Mr. Aaron. That justifies Charles' view that there are
some similarities between Ford Foundation and Government
sponsored activities.

Mr. Bader. Where our discussion was left before lunch
was on the question of the covert use of U.S. journalists and
media institutions, and as it was laid out, it was indicated
that the CIA's intended internal prohibition on the use of the |

media extended to the internal prohibitions on the use, opera-

tional use of individuals, American and foreign, who were $.:=
accredited to American media organizations.

As I heard it this morning, what we were discussing and
moving to was.to extend that prohibition to cover all American
individuals and media organizations, and that the question then
was whether this would be recommended to be something done in
law or a recommendation, or an insistence, if you will, to the
Agency that it further amend its internal directives, its
50-10, to put all media personnel, American media personnel on
the prohibited list, and that is I think where we were.

Senator Huddleston. I think that's an accurate statement.
That's where we were.

I had expressed a thought that I thought that it ought to
be expanded to include all, but we should hold off on the

statute business for the time being.

Senator Mathias. My role here seems to be the Devil's

Senator Huddleston. Good.

Senator Mathias. There is no question about the writing
American press or the value in print domestically. Maybe the
role, any legitimate role that news men could, journalists,
writers could fulfill is available through the information
agencies, USIA and groups of that sort.

So does anybody know whether there is any real need
for allowing some latitude, which is not covered by situations

that can be envisioned under USIA or other programs? ¢

Mr. Kirbow. Well, Senator, the one that I discussed earlidr
that I probably didn't make my point well because no one
seemed to have picked it up, is we do, by the words here, if I
Gaaerce ga Mr. Bader, prohibit an American citizen living in
Brussels and working for a local newspaper there from having

anything to do with the CIA.

Mr. Kirbow. That kind of relationship is something that
we should stay away from because I don't see any harm in it,
nor do I think the record demonstrates any harm in it. I don't
see -- I don't know how in the world this person doing that
taints..tha.minds of the American reading public, which is
apparently what you are trying -- you're not trying tovprotect
the newsman. You are trying to protect the reader who doesn't
know that.what he's getting is being spoonfed to him from the
CIA, and I don't know why we would be so concerned about

protecting newsmen from working, or prohibiting them from

working, because I think they have a right to do that as.

American citizens, just as they do to work with the Department
of Defense or any other agency.

Mr. Bader. You would then rescind the Agency's standing
prohibition?

Mr. Kirbow. I just don't think you ever. prohibit it in
law. i

Mr. diGenova. Are you talking aout an affiliated,
accredited journalist, because that's what the Agency pee eece|

Mr. Kirbow. Well, perhaps I misunderstand the extension

Do you want to go beyond where the administration is in

Mr. Bader. I am recommending to go beyond where the
Administration is at this stage, to extend ‘the operational
prohibition on ithe part of CIA to use American -- Americans in
the media --

media organizations.

Mr. Kirbow, Mr. Chairman, I don't think there is a single
shred of evidence on our record that that is in any way wrong=
doing or in any way adversely affects the rights of American
citizens. Clearly it will prohibit or could prohibit in the
future the proper use of an individual. that could be essential
to the intelligence collection processes of the CIA, and it

singles out a specific agency-which is not doing any harm to

Senator Mathias, If I wanted to.do it, Charlie, I think
I could work out a scheme. I would hire a prominent American
columnist to go and live in Paris, as Art Buchwald did, for
example.

Mr. Kirbow. And to pick off his columns and run them
in the New York Times. 7

Senator Mathias. And run them in the Paris Trib first,

and then let the domestic press pick him up.

Mr. Aaron. Well, suppose he writes for the Financial
Times?

Senator Mathias. Well, you could work out an echo program
if. you wanted.

Senator Huddleston. Well, the basic point, instead
of-picking instances, it seems to me, is whether or not as an
official policy of the United States Government we want an
institution such as the press with all it means and ali it is
supposed. to be in American with its constitutional provisions and
whatever, to be subverted to the secret, clandestine operation
that it can; Anytime we put any prohibition anywhere, we are

eliminating .somebody as a potential agent. You can't use

that as a guideline.

the press for operational purposes,

example of an American working for a foreign press, and what
the problem is. I think' the problem is that you have two
kinds of problems with the press. One is the fact, if it is
operating domestically, if it is working. for American media
institutions, it is clear that they are subject to some
manipulation or at. least questionable manipulation, and there
are issues in people's minds as to its integrity.
Now, the question goes beyond that to what about people
who might be working for some. foreign -- American journalists,

possibility of the American press getting discredited, having
problems of being able to perform its normal functions in the
world and performing in the United States because it is part
of a clandestine intelligence organization.

Mr. Kirbow. Don't you think that's an individual right
that a person has the right to exercise both ways, instead of
one way? :

Mr. Aaron. Charles, what I think I have told the
Committee,,I have a real problem with the concept of the
American people having the right to spy, somehow, and these

prohibitions don't go to what people are allowed to do on ¢

Bill has provided as a prohibition.

There are two questions. One is whether the person has

the possible contamination of the American press, which seems

of distortion, the £lowback problem in America.

And the second problem seems to he, with an example like
that, is that it seems to -- there is very little stock in the
argument, because the argument about distortion of what goes
on in foreign countries and people's perceptions is at the heart
of the question of whether the CIA or any government agency
should be engaged in- propaganda,. because it is quite possible
the propaganda gets picked up in the same way, and the questién~
is obviously of line drawing: how do you want to draw the
line.

It strikes me that there may be better. ways to draw the -
line than the suggested prohibition that Bill has for any
American, regardless of ee who they write for or what
they are doing. |

Mr. Bader. Well, you misunderstood me. I was putting out
the various possibilities.

will help.

First turn to 61. Let's try to get some idea of what the
problem is before we get to the semantics of it. All right,
just let me go through this, then'we'll see what is actually
being recommended here.

This is the additive. The recommendation here is to

the rights and/or in some vague way affects the mental processes
to:theidetriment of the American citizenry, that we don't
concern ourselves with passing laws to protect the person who
reads something that these people do. If you do. this, you open
that can of worms which gets you into a prohibition against any
work in the press or elsewhere in a propaganda fashion.

Now, the Committee may decide that propaganda is in fact
something that we should prohibit by law, but doing this
piecemeal like this, it does just exactly that. I see nothing
in our record that indicates that the use of certain of thése
people overseas or for cover in any way ~- there is not u
any evidence that‘'it’has: adversely affected the rights of the
citizens of the United States. There is a potential for
abuse in practically anything secret and covert.

Senator Huddleston. I don't believe the recommendation
at the top of page 64 violates what you have just said.

Mr. Maxwell. I would not think that --

Mr. Kirbow.. Well, it says, Mr. Chairman, that by statute,
by statute, which means by law, the CIA should be prohibited
from using American media organizations for cover. We apparent.
have 65 people, a portion of which are being used for cover,
and apparently they consider them to be an essential asset, or
they wouldn't be using them.

Is that correct, Mr. Bader?

Mr. Kirbow. Yes.

Mr. Bader. I would assume that they would have extended
their prohibition to this, or on the other hand one could argue
I don't know, what their motives were. It could have been they
felt that this, the first step they took was the one that was
dealing with what the public was demanding.

Mr. Kirbow. Well, I really don't. see anything in our
record or any evidence that they have given us or anything
other than a staff position on this which we are trying to
sell the Committee that this is a harmful procedure. 4

Senator Huddleston. What this does is extends beyond
the practice of journalists to any other person, be it an
executive or clerk or typist or whatever, on the assumption
that you can't be a little bit pregnant. If the agency is
going to be subverted anywhere, not the agency, if the insti-
tution of the press is, that it is going to be’ subverted.

.Mr. Bader. nr. Chairman, the Agency has accepted the
basic principle, because it has removed from its list of
operational assets a rather larger number than this would
call for.

Mr. Kirbow, But if I hear correctly what you are saying
then, we are out to protect the American media from being made
pregnant by the CIA and not worrying at-.all about the reading

public or the other,. but just the media.

Mr. Aaron. the word. "printed" dropped out for the new
reason! One, it makes it easier to prohibit-the distribution
if you don't identify where the printing is taking place, and
secondly, while there is no printing going on here, the
question really goes to distribution. I think that was the
concurrence of the Committee.

instead of listed under recommendations, is the last paragraph
on 63, is that correct?

Mr. Aaron. Yes, that would be picked up as a recommenda-

Senator Hart of Colorado. Just for clarification, Mac, is
that the entire minority or what?

Senator Mathias. No, it's only one member.

Senator Huddleston. Now we are ready to deal with the
clergy.

Mr. Aaron. The point here is, I think, the CIA takes
the position that it has no covert arrangements with Amerigan:.
clergy and laity, and that this will continue as policy, but

they have relationship of a clandestine character which don't

involve remuneration.

Senator Huddleston. Incidentally, is that a new policy?

Mr. Bader. Yes, as of February 10, 1976.

Mr. Aaron. It's pretty short. This is the sum total of
our findings, and it explains it Revie than I can.

Senator Mathias. A few patriotic volunteers.

from the operational records.

I think, too, they have what is called a memorandum of

involves paid or unpaid.

overseas?

Would this take care of them and prevent them from getting

Mr. Kirbow. They are not church people, per se. It as
part of their religion, doing the service. You see, this bets
tobe a rather broad extension, or you leave out certain
things if you are not careful with your definition.

we define them -- and that's obviously an important question,
that they either be prohibited by statute. The other alternati'
is to simply prohibit any further or recommend the prohibition
of any further CIA recruitment in this field.

Mr. Maxwell. There may be a First Amendment argument
here, particularly in fundamentalist groups whose religious.
beliefs are committed, are directed toward opposition toward
Godless atheism.

Mr. diGenova. Except that the control of religious organi-|
zation has historically been subject to governmental regulation
in this sense: the Supreme Court in light of Senator Hart's
question last night, I did a little bit of research. The
example, the prime example of regulation doesn't deal so
much with prohibition of the Government dealing with intel.
although there are vast areas where the government is not 4.
permitted to get into. The question is, for years the Supreme
Court has ruled that there are certain health regulations &
states that religious sects must comply with, and they have
to comply with it even if it conflicts with their basic 2
belief, that they have to comply with it, like quarantines
or things of that nature.

So there is clearly an area where the First Amendment of
religious freedom concept falls in the face of a greater good,
the need of the general public, and that has generally ‘been
in the health area, where there is some practice of the
religion which conflicts with some standard’ which has been
set in the community at: large, and that generally has dealt

with health.

“Mr. diGenova. Self-immolation.

Senator Huddleston. The snake acts and innoculations.

Mr. diGenova. That's exactly right.

Mr. Maxwell. The problem is that's not quite applicable
to this, and one. has to argue in the past the Court has ruled
on things that are found to be a threat to the personal liveli-
hood or health of the individual rather than something. that
could be construed in a fundamentalist sense.

Senator Huddleston, This doesn't preclude a sect that
may be anti-atheist and as such anti-Communist from pursuifig

its principles, but the restriction would be pursing them through

methods.
Ms. Culbreath. Would this prohibit, then, somebody who vad
a member of one of these sects that was in an area where they
gained information that would be helpful from them being sources?

Senator Huddleston. I wouldn't think so if they wanted
to write letters to the CIA.

Ms. Culbreath. Well, just in terms of the debriefing kind
of thing, or contact.

Ms. Davis. We are talking about operational, not coming
in to the Domestic. Contact Service.

what was operational support, if operational. support would be i
what did you learn about individuals there who might be
receptive to American approaches. Then the clergy would be
prohibited from providing that kind of information if that

is operational support.

Senator Mathias. Well, it seems to me if the religious
came in and said I was at a meeting of the Holy Rollers last nig|
and we all went down on the mourner's bench, and I. heard the
most remarkable things, and this is what I heard, there would
be no prohibition against listening. Now, if you say, go Back

Senator Huddleston. Then it is operational.

I.don't think there's a need to write in that it doesn't
pertain to the voluntary furnishing of information. I don't
know.

Mr. Aaron. I don't think -- no, that's really not an
operational use, quite frankly. It's very similar to the DCD
which takes information from lots of people, including people
who are and have been for some time proscribed by CIA's own eet

out in the statute itself.

these three, these four, now, that we have just approved, it
would be of any value: to assert in our report that we recognize
that the Agency has to find proper pes for its agents, that
restricting that cover is a matter of some importance, but there
are certain institutions that the Committee feels because of
their nature and because of their standing in the country, and
because ef the eda for the public to have confidence in them,
that they should be, in effect, off limits, and because off that
we recommend that these four recommendations be brought. t

not.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Chairman, does the absence
of brackets on the next set of recommendations mean that they
are non-controversial?

Senator Hart of Colorado. Yes.

Mr. Aaron, That is correct.

At the bottom of page 67 is a bracketed quote about

Now, if my memory serves me correctly -- now, first of all,
this is the first time that anyone is mentioned by name in the

Senator Huddleston. And the total findings are in that
section.

Mr. Kirbow. The findings are this foreign and military.

‘Senator Huddleston. We referred to Helms and uaird, but,

I think we decided we could write around that.

Mr. diGenova. Well, here's what happened here. This
paragraph deals with..the fact ‘that when the Agency disposes or
dissolves a proprietary, it. tries to avoid conflicts of interest.

However, when noted that sometimes pressures were brought
to bear on the Agency to dispose of the entity as a favor to
someone, so that it would benefit someone else.

Now, the most glaring example of this was this activity
of the former Director, Admiral Raborn, who actually became
involved in negotiations on behalf of a client, Overseas
National Airways, which he represented, and he.wanted the sale
of Southern. Air Transport, which was a CIA proprietary, large

assets and large property, to Overseas National Airways, which

of course would have acquired Southern Air Transport’ lucrative

Now, the. way I originally had it written was “A former
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency sought unsuccéss~
fully to influence the sale.” However, if it was left that way,
people would have to guess at which one of these guys did this
and it would unfairly impugn all of the directors. The name
was inserted. Therefore, the question now becomes whether it
should be left in at all since the name is inserted, and since
the name is mentioned in the report, and whether or not the
whole sentence--

Senator Hart of Colorado. Well, what if we just saig "A

Mr. diGenova. Well, the problem there, Senator, is then

Mr. Inderfurth. I think the assumption would be Richard
Helms.

Mr. diGenova. McCone more than Helms.

Senator Hart of Colérado. Well, we ran into this last
summer with the Exener matter and all like that.

Ms. Culbreath. A former person.

Mr. diGenova. The Agency itself cited this as the most

suppose the same arguments could bej used here on this matter.

Mr. Kirbow. But the-point I raised at the staff meeting

just before the Committee came back, when. the subject was
raised, was did Admiral Raborn, as a retired military officer,
currently in a civilian status, although he was Sener -- break
any American law, or had they sold it to this, would it have
been a violation of the law, and the answer was no.

If he was involved -- or they| knew of no law that he

had violated, and none is apparently cited in the record.

Pressure was brought-to bear, there! is no doubt about it, by

‘Admiral Raborn. I think there's another example, I'm not

sure whether Joe described it to me| or someone else, of a :
very senior official out. there dealing back with the Agency.

Now, the military, as Senator Hart knows, is prohibited
from this by regulations and I think by law. I know that asa

Senator Huddleston. Joe, is it accurate to i that
pressures were often brought to bear?

Mr. diGenova. We changed that to say. sometimes. This is
a rewrite. Someone else wrote this after I had submitted it,
and we had a meeting today, and we changed several things in
there.

_So I leave it up to the Committee. This was a matter that
I -- I wanted to flag it and leave it there. The explanation
is as clear as I can give it.

Mr. Inderfurth. This is the first time he is mentionéd -

Mr. diGenova. That's right.

Senator Huddleston. Why don't we delete that sentence and
hea it in our full report, our big report.

Mr. Kirbow. There is a major classified report on
this that would contain all the facts.

Senator Huddleston. I am goncerned now. whether. any other
instances of someone may be, of similar standing as Admiral
Raborn.

’ Mr. diGenova. Yes. There are instances in the record
which do not deal with proprietaries, of John McCone interceding
on behalf of Pan American directly with the Director of
Central Intelligence, and it is not mentioned in the report,

Chairman, has been that the work involving the relationship of
the Central Intelligence Agency with American business companies
was severed off from the proprietary work for the simple

reason that they Ae not the same thing.

That work has been done. It has not been pursued vigorous-
ly, not because the individual who was responsible for ité
didn't want to.

Senator Huddleston. That happened after he left.

Mr. diGenova. That's right, after Mr. McCone left the

DCI, he had frequent contacts, according to the records, with

the Agency, with high level Agency personnel, and in one ihstane

he interceded personally with the Director of Central Intelli- [
gence to avoid actions which would be taken by another govern-
ment and its:airline-which would adversely affect Pan American
yora Airways.

Senator Huddleston. It is hard to separate a man from his
past totally.

Mr. diGenova. It seems particularly hard with DCIs.

Mr. Kirbow. Well, not only here, this is not with the
Agency, but it came up in my experience with the Armed Services
Committee involving Continental Airlines.

Ms. Culbreath. Mr. Chairman, could I suggest that maybe if
we do delete that, that we perhaps redo that previous sentence
to make it a little stronger, and perhaps in some way
indicate that these were serious pressures, and they were, I
think, hard pressures to withstand when somebody in that kind
of position --

Senator Huddleston. They were withstood, though.

Mr. Maxwell. They would get lost the way the sentence ‘is

will get together, and Elizabeth, and we will change this
"however" sentence, ¢he sentence .that precedes the one that
has just been deleted, and we will expand that sentence to
more accurately explain that the. pressures came. from high soureas
sometimes. Some of them may have been maybe. former Agency
directors,

it was former.

tomorrow to review the cover paper from which this summary is
drawn. I know Eric has some problems with the cover paper, bot!
editorially, because they view it as overly simplistic and
harsh because it-. reflects all of the Inspector General's
judgments, but they have some problems with cover in general,
but I don't think this is going to be part of that problem.

Senator Huddleston. I have some problem with this page
70.relating to Welch because it seems the whole implication of
that is that he was. murdered because his cover was blown, and
so far there has been no evidence that that.is the case. Pn
highlights the argument, I think, correctly, but it. seems bo me
it leaves’ the impression that here is a case where a fellow's
cover of lack of cover resulted in his death.

I think the Agency people have specifically said to us
so far that they have no reason at this point yet to expect
that that was the reason he got killed.

Mr. Maxwell. In regard to the specific quote, I think
we have to be very careful as to getting involved in an argumen
which would imply that anything that we possibly did had an
effect on it; and also, that it seems to point to Mr. Welch
and say, well, it is all his fault.

Senator Huddleston. He didn't protect. his cover, he
didn't do what they advised him to do, and you see ‘down here

kind of action which unfortunately led ito the death of Dick
Welch. There again we are ascribing something to the death of
Dick Welch which nobody knows yet, you know, what terrorists
killed him or why;.at least our record doesn't show.

Mr. diGenova. These statements here, Senator, this isa
direct quote from Eric Eisenstead's memo. Do you think that
we should maybe. in the findings and recommendations shorten
this and maybe --

Mr. Kirbow. I think the part of the record which is. an
unknown fact is why Dick Welch was killed, and we should stay
away from any quotes or other pronouncements in our paper ‘which
attribute his death to any particular thing unless we Pete
something.

Mr. Aaron. I think that is a good point. We might put
in here a statement which says the Committee has no information
as to the Poacona? purposes or cause, specific eaaaae of his :
death. The point is to get at the question of cover, to
step out to the question of cover in the report, as we do, I

think, appropriately, but not have talked about the one case

‘where this all came out in public, rightly or wrongly.

Now, the obvious public relations value of Mr. Welch's
death, the first time in! history the DDO and the DCI go to
a funeral in public, they never did that, and there is no doubt
that they tried to. make political hay out of his death. I
think it is only fair that the Committee ultimately say --

Senator Huddleston. Right, but I think you've got two
different problems. You've got a problem with whether the
Committee wants to present its case and exonerate itself on the
basis of everything that.is known about the death. of Welch,
and whether that is pertinent to the problem of cover.

Now, we make a recommendation that the CIA shall make:

effort to place a greater proportion of its officer abroad
under nonofficial cover.’ It seems like what we need, there's
a statement here is that official cover has not proved to be
effective, and if we mention Welsh at all, I think the point we
mention there is that his name was carried, that while he was
there supposedly under cover, his name was in fact carried in a
newspaper, the name of his newspaper had been carried in.a
foreign newspaper, and he was living in a house that was known
to be the house.

Mr..Kirbow. His true identity was widely known.

indicating why he had been killed, of here is a case that

idiot.

Mr. Kirbow.. It could have been like the Senator, John
Stennis case, where they buttonholed him in front of his
house and killed him for robbery purposes.

Senator Huddleston. We've asked them two or three times
here, have we not?

Mr. diGenova. Yes, we have. In fact they don't know.

the rest of that sentence, and then add in here, as you did,

cover being diminished, is the situation in the world with
terrorism or the vulnerability it makes of people --

was meant by "should be kept small," and I tried to indicate
really we are talking about Air America where you had 8000
employees of the CIA, btn in Langley and abroad, and then
another 8000 employees of the Air America complex. That is”
big.

But ..I think: what-.wecshould say is; organizationally small,|

larger in terms of finances, also. Then you have both of the
problems we addressed in the paper, which was the risk of
unfair competition with private enterprise, and. the risk of
blowing cover, of compromising security.

So I think that --

Senator Huddleston. I was wondering if it could be
designed in such a way as care should be taken that it not be
any larger than necessary to achieve the objective for which
it was established.

Mr. Kirbow. . Excuse me, Senator. It would not get the

Air America thing because at the time they needed one twicé

that size.
Senator Huddleston. hey needed it that big, that's
right.
; Mr. diGenova. The reason this language is in here is that
the Agency officials themselves who testified, all of them,
including the DDO, said they would like to have small ones, in
other words, a small number-of employees, small operation.
Senator Huddleston. What about their insurance business?
Mr. diGenova.' “That's kind of an exception, although
actually that is an example of a lot of money with only a few
employees. There are only a couple of people that run that
whole thing, Isenstead and a couple of -- one investor,

Istenstead, and an auditor. ‘There are three men that run that

Mr. Aaron. It's not mentioned specifically, but it might
be possible to say, you know, maybe you can put a footnote on
the first paragraph which simply said --

Mr. diGenova. You mean on the findings of page 66 that
“too often large proprietaries have created unfair" --

Mr. Aaron. “Unwarranted risks of unfair competition with

and current operations.

The Chairman. There can't be anything wrong with leaving
the sentence in there.

Mr. Maxwell. May I raise a question to the second
recommendation, as to the reason why by statute there would be
an annual review rather than recommending that to Congressional
Committees.

The second part of that is, my-understanding of a number
of the proprietaries is that they are not operatingy and to
require GAO audilt of a whole group of in a.sense notional

organizations may be preempting the kind of review that the

Mr. aigcha ght This is a rewrite of my original recommen-

is superfluous, if you are considering oversight by a committee.

Senator Huddleston. The Committee cannot conduct an audit,
though.

Mr. diGenova. And that was the purpose for the Committee
taking on board independent GAO auditors.

Mr. Maxwell. The Committee can request GAO auditors.

Mr. Kirbow.) Anything that appears to be on an audit —
calls for an audit. i

Senator Huddleston. Calls for a GAO audit or gives the .
Committee authority to call for one.

Mr. diGenova. I don't think we need a statute. We can
talk about it as part of Congressional oversight. As part of
the Congressional oversight function, the oversight committee
should review proprietaries annually ‘and where necessary
conduct audits with the assistance of the General Accounting
office.

Mr. Kirbow.| Here, Mr. Chairman, I think again the point we

made yesterday, that we should say at least annually, so that
they don't put you in a box if you want one every two months

sight Committee of an internal CIA audit, is that rigt?

Mr. Kirbow. In three I am not sure what you mean,:."In' the

thing which the Secretary of Defense and the Director of cad
CIA makes to the Appropriations Committee.

Mr. diGenova. We are talking about an authorization,
aren't we, an annual authorization here?

Mr. Inderfurth. Look on. page 26 and you'll see the
definition of that under (b). The DCI. shall have vesponsibility
for: preparing the budget of the national intelligence program

is the budget presentation that's being referred to under
this.

Mr. Kirbow. Well, now you come to the real question,

any money or anything. They are just shelf items.

proprietaries found their way-into the budget, and that Senators
knew what they were authorizing when they authorized the budget.

Now, how it gets in there, I am not a budget: expert.

Mr. Kirbow. That is what I am trying to supply here becaus
in this process there is a procedure that when you say there shat.
be authorizing legislation, where the line items are discussed
before the authorizing committee and not before the budget
committee, which is the appropriations committee, and if you
require that he discuss or report the annual operation of the

proprietaries in his annual report to the oversight committee,

you will accomplish what you are trying to do, and not exclude

it only for the presentation before the Appropriations Committee.

Mr. Maxwell. Could I try a fix on this?

Mr. diGenova. You are invited.

Mr, Maxwell. The oversight committee should require that
the DCI's budget presentation to the Appropriations Committee
and the oversight committee_include a specific discussion of
the financial aspects of CIA proprietaries. I mean, we are
trying to bring them out and see what the impact is on the
budget, where do they. fit in.

identifying the proprietary and where it is located and whatevey.

In effect, the proprietary was earning money which was
financing the proprietary organization.

Mr. Kirbow. But they can no longer. do that. What they
earn now must go into the general Treasury.

Mr. Aaron. No, gross earnings do not go into the general
Treasury. Their net, and part of the cost of doing business
would include the cost of some of their operational purposes.

I think the point of this inclusion here was to see if
one could require in connection with the budget, not just in
general, with an audit of what it-does specifically, but in

terms of the entire activity of the CIA, to get a spelling out Ls

and secondly, its budget implications for the certain categories
of operations which were involved, such as, if you are talking.
about the conduct of the support for the activities in Laos.

Mr. diGenova. Paramilitary operations.

Mr. Kirbow. Well, leave it like it is if that is what‘ you
are trying to do, because they will be sure to, report it-to
the Appropriations Committee in excruciating detail, but they
won't report it to the authorization committee unless they
require it to get money.

Mr. diGenova. That language would mean it's included in
his presentation in some way because the allusion that David
made to Jim Taylor is that they are beginning to put it into
their budget presentation. I know that is a term of art.

Mr. Maxwell. I would assume it is going to be a subsection
of operational support in covert action.

Mr. Aaron. Not necessarily. I think they are struggling
with that at aes trying to define it properly and how

it should be presented.. I mean, I really don't think we know.

They have an intention to do it because they. recognize that--

potentially it is a source of real question as to how much
money is being spent, on clandestine activities: that is self-
generated by the Agency because of its proprietary
activities,

Mr. diGenova. The impact, Senator, was also to show that
the Committeé had looked at this broadly, was aware of possible
budget and authorization implications of various entities,
including proprietaries, and that it wanted to say something
‘about that. It was not necessarily anything dramatic.

Senator Huddleston. Well, I will agree with that. I am

you are exposing cover.

suggested got to that.

Mr. Aaron. Well, let me see if I can read out what I would
propose along the lines I think we discussed.

The oversight committee should require that the fiscal
impact of proprietaries be made clear in the DCI's. budget
presentation to the oversight committee. If you want to add
the appropriations committee, you can, but I think the point is
that that happens.

Mr. Kirbow. If you'll listen just one minute, Mr. Miller
knows and I believe the Senator knows that "in the Senate there
is a formal budget presentation” *. made to the Appropriations
Committees." They are not made elsewyere. Reports are made
to oversight committees on the status and all of these other
things, and if they request any money for those proprietaries,
they would request that before the authorizing committee. If
you are just trying: to accomplish getting it made known to. the
oversight committee, drop the word "budget presentation" and
adopt the common usage of the annual report of the Agency or
of the DCI.

But that is kind of a word of art. Those are words of
art in the Senate, and they will seize on it because today
they don't do it for anybody else but the Appropriations
Committee.

Senator Huddleston. I think that's reasonable. enough.

It ought to be clear.

committees, when we want, I think, to be able to go to the
Congress and say, we recommend most strenuously that only these
two methods be used for funding, rather than providing a third
method. and eomesne aye: well, maybe we- should have a fourth
method, and I would like to go with the strongest possible
recommendation in regard to the earlier statutory requirement
that it only be by specific ppropriation to. covert action and
the contingency reserve fund.

Mr. Kirbow. Otherwise, Mr. Chairman, we will stand a
chance of getting the other: amended,. to allow. the: oversight
committee. to allow it.

Mr. diGenova. Why don't we say this by statute, and then
have the rest of the sentence an addendum which would just
allude to the fact that funding is to be accomplished to the
method we set out if you want to eliminate it.

Well, this was the problem that was raised, or an issue
that was raised during the study, and this is set in here

for that reason, It can easily be removed if it is inconsistent

|| with another recommendation of the Committee.

Mr. Aaron. Well, we have two or three different earlier
provisions that relate to this. The first is that re-
ae authority, defining reprogramming authority, the
possibility that something used, for a program covert action xX
which involves a proprietary. that generates a certain amount

of money, can be used for proguam Y.

The second issue is we have proposed that covert actions
be funded either by line item or by the contingency reserve.

The third thing we proposed is that the contingency reserve!
be replenished, if I am correct, only by appropriation, concur-
rence of the oversight Committee.

Now, what this in effect does, I think the question that *:
he's driving at is, what do you do with the profits. of a
proprietary organization? ‘can you put it in the contingency
reserve?

-If so, our other recommendation would pick up the notion

that it can only be done with the concurrence of the Committee. a

Is there some other purpose, direct transfer? Well,

presumably one of the limitations on reprogramming -- and this
would be. a fair point.to make here, as part of its definition
of limitations on reprogramming, it is recommended that the
oversight committee proscribe the allocation of profits from
any proprietary to a covert operation without their express
consent. And this is really kind of -- if it doesn't go.throug
the contingency reserve, it really goes to the question of
reprogramming.

Now, I realize that we have said that our other recommen~
dation by. implication would prohibit this, but it is only by
implication, I would think.

Mr. Maxwell. My sense is that by providing this --

to generate funds, and secondly, I think it is the easiest way
for the oversight committee to have a handle on covert action,
and particularly its funding, is to say there are two ways you
can do it. You can do it either by the regular appropriation
process, or you can do it through the contingency reserve fund.
But if you start to build in the ways that the contingency
reserve fund can be replenished, I think people -- I think therd
may be a loss of control.

Mr. Maxwell... I understand that, but I guess I was trying
to clean up the organizational structure.

Mr. Kirbow. I think this is the problem with recommending
the legislation piecemeal, is that the insurance company out
there is a covert operation. It is a secret operation at the
agency unauveed ‘nllthat manner, and if you allow only.
covert operation to be funded only from the contingency

Mr. diGenova. And the reason for that is every other
government i.agency is ‘subject to the rules.and. statutes of the’!

Mr. Kirbow. Do you see this could be an abuse area?

Mr. diGenova. I could see the Attorney General, if he

pressure on the CIA to dispose of a piece of property, would
want to know about that, since they are not subject to the
‘Federal Disposal of Property Act like every other government

agency is.

I don't think -- I think the record clearly shows, and
the General counsel indicated that he was: not opposed to having

under a specific law, which this agency is not under, so it will

have some assurance that it is being done in a’. proper way.

Mr. Bader. How do you feel about this, Joe?

Mr. diGenova. This is a problem because just like the man
says, cover is a relative thing. I don't think there is
anything wrong with saying that the CIA, that they should make
an effort to put -- really not much of a recommendation -- should
make an effort to place a greater. proportion of its officers
abroad under nonofficial cover, and the Agency does not see
that in this form, wouldn't view that as a bad thing. They thin
cover is, if it is deep and effective, is okay. They just say
well, their answér this way, well, you know, you don't do

much work under deep, nonofficial cover, and one of the prices

you pay is you don't have a lot of operational freedom. ybu
have to work hard at’ your regular job and you don't do a whole
heck of a lot.
: The recommendation, the way it is phrased, is sort of a
push to them to see if they can find peteee ways. It also
probably tells them that maybe they should use proprietaries
abroad a little more, which are very, very efficient, according
to Eric, according to both things, operations and cover.

Mr. Aaron. I think we have got to be careful on this

point. I mean, we ought to wait until the staff director~
returns because I think he has a particular interest in this
suggestion, but we are talking about moving more people into

unofficial cover. I would like to express my own persional

reservations about that in terms of its relationship to a

number of things that the Committee has already decided to do.

Senator Huddleston. We are eliminating a lot of cover.

Mr. Aaron. That's the first thing.

Now, the second thing -- and these are nonoffocial cover
categories. The second thing that we are Going is trying to
place somewhat greater authority in the hands of the ambassador
and the missions overseas to know what is going on. That is
something that they can do when it is in their house. It-is
something that's extremely difficult for them to do when it is
off in the forest someplace.

So it is -- and as Joe just said, it. looks like a recommen

dation to use more proprietaries, in part because it is in’ the
same section, but in reality because that is one of the ways
they might do it, ona I. just wonder how much we have thought
through for ourselves eee the balance of our recommendations
lie, particularly since most of the stuff is derived basically
from operational experience anyway.

There was a period, toward the end of Mr. Bissell's
career! in the Agency, or maybe shortly thereafter, when they
began to try to put more people in unofficial cover, and it
wasn't a very good experience for them.

Mes Ri pboe! David, how does the ambassador lose control,
whether it is official or unofficial, except that he has got

them in his compound? Itlis an official. government function

over which he has absolute control.

Senator Huddleston. But if they keep coming to the
embassy to check with him, they blow their cover, unless they do
it by telephone.

Mr. Kirbows Well, I don't think they should go to the
embassy at all. I think their contact should become covert.

Mr. diGenova. Well, we're sort of caught between a rock
and a hard place because we know the official cover is we cover

Mr. Kirbow. We are asking them.to proscribe against

Senator Huddleston. Shouldn't we say that the time has
come for a whole review of cover to see whether or not they
can find some better ways?

others, ,recommended very strongly that there be more unofficial
covers.

I think the Agency has been under considerable pressure
throughout its existence to do that, and as Joe pointed out
there are cettain limits to what it has been able to do.

Senator Huddleston. Well, I think rather than suggest
what ought to be more or less official or unofficial cover, the
whole:matter ought to be studied immediately by the Agency, and
see if they can find some new ways consistent with all the
restraints and prohibitions that the Committee has placed upon

them. {

Senator Huddleston. All right,.where does that leave us

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, might I suggest that in keeping
with an earlier discussion today, that because it is a summary
of findings as well as an introduction, that perhaps while
