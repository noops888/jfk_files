MEMORANDUM..FOR :

SUBJECT:

David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board

CIA Employees

(We request that this memorandum be returned to CIA

once

the Review Board has completed its dellberations on the

issues discussed below.)

1.

(U)

Jane. The purpose of this memo is to relate

CIA'g concerns to the Review Board regarding the release of

the true names of CIA employees that appear in the JFK

Collection and to present a proposal on how this problem

might be addressed.

I. Factual Backaround

2.

(U)

To date, approximately 600 true names of CIA

employees have been identifled in the JEK Collection. some

of these employees are important to the JFK story, and CIA

will continue to work with the Review Board to release as

many of these names as possible.

Many names, however,

appear only a few

times in the

entire JFK Collection and

appear to add nothing to the historical record.

3. (U) Under guidelines adopted by the Review Board

on or about 20 March 1996, any names of CIA employees are

presumptively released unless CIA provides specific evidence

to the Review Board that harm to the national security or to

the employee would likely result from such release.

these guidelines were adopted, It has become increasingly

clear that the number of names at issue, and, in most cases,

their tenuous connection to the JFK story, make this

approach unworkable with regard to both CIA's obligation to

protect national security information and the Review Board's

duty to Inform the public about the JFK assassination in a

timely and accurate fashion.

The task of locating and

Informing hundreds of former employees scattered all over

the country and the world has been a formidable one. Some

employees have contacted us to report their concerns about a

"suspicious" letter purporting to be from CIA which they had

received.

It would not be surprising, therefore, if many

former employees ignored the letter for similar reasons,

even though they might have legitimate needs to protect

their identities.

4.

(U) Contacting every named employee and collecting

information on each of them to present to the Review Board

will clearly take more time and effort than any of us had

anticipated. This will have obvious ramifications for how

and when the Review Board releases information to the

public.

More importantly, the decision to publicly

acknowledge employees who

may have been living for over 30

years under cover is a critical one that should be made not

by default, but rather by careful planning and

consideration.

(U) Relevant to this discussion is the fact that

the Review Board and CIA have recently agreed upon a policy

for releasing true names of sources of intelligence

information.

It was agreed at that time that there would be

a presumption of protecting source names; but in cases where

a source was particularly important to the JEK story and

there was no overriding national security interest, the name

would be released.

Although the CIA recognizes that there

are some sensitivities involved with sources that do not

apply to covert employees, there are also many legal and

operational

similarities, which are described herein; that's

justify gimilar treatment by the Review Board. As 18

further detailed in Section IV, CIA, therefore, proposes

that the Review Board adopt a

general policy of protecting

employee names that appear in the Collection, with

exceptions for those individuals whom the Board believes are

important to the JER story.

II, LegaL Considerationa

(U) As both covert CIA employees and clandestine

reporting assets are types of "human sources" of

intelligence, many of the game laws apply.

Although Section

11(a) of the JFK Act provides that, when the Act reguires

release of information, it takes precedence over all other

laws that would otherwige prohibit release, there are strong

governmental national security interests in protecting the

true names of CIA employees. CIA belleves that it 18

important for the Review Board to reconsider the lawg which

protect clasgified Information, because they clearly reflect

a larger US Government policy to protect covert CIA

employees from disclosure.

7. (U) By Executive order and statute, the President

and Congress have made the Director of Central Intelligence

responsible for protecting sources of intelligence.

In his

Directive of 22 January 1946 that established the Central

Intelligence Group, President Truman made the DCI

responsible for protecting sources. With the establishment

of CIA, Congress also gave the DCI this responsibility.

The

National Security Act of 1947, Section 103 (d) (3), codified

at 50 USC ยง403 (3) (C) (5), reguires the DCI to protect

intelligence sources from unauthorized disclosure. In

addition, ยง403 (3) (d) (2) requires the DCI to ensure that

risks to the United States and thoge involved in the

collection of intelligence through human sources are

minimized.

8.

(U) Protecting the identity of individuals working

for CIA, not only covertly but overtly as well, has been of

particular concern to US lawmakers since the establishment

of the Agency.

For example, with Section 6 of the Central

Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, 50 USC ยง403g, Congress

specifically exempted the CIA from the provisions of any law

requiring the publication or disclosure of the organization,

functions, names, titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel

employed by the Agency.

9.

(U) In 1980, Congress pagged the Classified

Information Procedures Act (CIPA) which sets out pretrial,

trial, and appellate procedures for criminal cases involving

"or potentially involving clasgified Information. Working

with the Department of Justice and the courts, CIA has

successfully protected the names of CIA employees from

public release even in criminal trials where there are

heightened

(i.e., constitutional) considerations favoring

disclosure to the defendant of all government information

relevant to the defense.

CIPA allows for In camera ex parte

hearing in which the judge can rule on questions of

admissibility and relevancy of classified Information,

including the identity of CIA employees who may have

intormation pertaining to the defense, before it 18

introduced either to the defendant, defense counsel, or in

open court.

In some cases involving CIA, the juage

has

ordered that CIA information be turned over to the defenge,

but only in some unclassified form such as in a summary.

In

other cases, judges have reviewed the classified information

and ruled that the harm to national security outweighs the

defendant's legal rights to the information.

In still other

cases, the defense was never notified that CIA even had

Information bearing on the case, as the judge ruled that the

mere fact that CIA possessed this information was classified

and outweighed any rights the defendant had.

Moreover,

under CIPA, the Attorney General has the authority to drop a

prosecution in those cases where the risk to national

security is too great.

(U) In 1982, Congress again acted to protect CIA

employees by

passing the Intelligence Identities Protection

Act of 1982,

50 USC ยง421 that criminalizes the revelation of

a covert employee or the identity of a source.

This act

subjects anyone who reveals information that identifies a

"covert agent" to prosecution and provides up. to 10 years in

prison and $50,000 in fines as punishment.

This act

specifically defines a "covert agent" as including

"an

officer or employee of an intelligence agency...

11. (U) Most recently, President Clinton signed

Executive Order 12958 on classified national security

information that became effective in October 1995. Although

it requires generally that agencies make greater

declassification efforts than under the prior executive

order,

Executive Order 12958 affords human sources of

intelligence Information, which would Include employees,

extra protection from the declassification provigions.

Under E.O. 12958, Information that is over 25 years old and

having historical

value must be declagsified within five

rears..

However, information revealing the identity of a

Juman

source may continue to be protected.

12 -

(U) The above federal laws show a long-standing

practice by the"US Government to protect CIA employees from

disclosure to the public.

In carrying out its statutory

obligations, the Review Board should give serious weight to

this policy and afford the protection of CIA employees a

Inte berational Considerations

13.

(U)

For current CIA employees whose names may

appear in the JFK Collection, the operational considerations

for protecting their identity are similar to those for

sources. Many of these employees have worked "under cover"

for CIA. Cover is used to disassociate entire installationg

and offices from open linkage to intelligence activities, to

enable intelligence personnel to enter and work effectively

in foreign countries, to shield Agency employees and

authorized clandestine activities from attention by hostile

elements and from media exposure, to facilitate access to

certain individuals of intelligence interest, to prevent

embarrassment to host foreign governments, and to permit

plausible denial of CIA's presence and activities in foreign

countries.

14. (U) The ability to maintain one's cover is

crucial to gathering intelligence.

In either a "hostile" of

"friendly" country, should the local service become aware of

who the CIA employees are,

it would increase surveillance

and make unilateral operations difficult if not impossible.

In some countries, the local government tolerates the CIA

presence and agrees to work with us as long as the local

population 18 not aware of the circumstances.

Once it

becomes known among the locals that certain US Government

officials are actually CIA, pressure may be placed on the

government to expel those Americans, disrupting liaison and

diplomatic relationships.

More importantly, covert

employees and their families would face increased risk to

their personal safety.

Even in "friendly" countries, our

employees could face some personal risks as well as risks to

ongoing operations from extremists who may be living among

important round eat, are 4o

an otherwise benign local population.

In any of these

cases, should a covert employee's cover be publicly

compromised, that employee may have to be recalled from the

field; and it could be difficult to place him elsewhere in

an operationally and physically secure location.

Thus,

maintaining cover is important to a case officer's

effectiveness and to the continuation of a career with CIA.

15.

(S)

Maintaining the confidentiality of cover is

also important to cover providers.

The Review Board will

recall from prior briefings by the Agency that covert CIA

employees, both in the United states and overseas, can work

under

"official" (e.g..

or "non-

official" (e.g..L

cover.

Disclogure of a

covert employee would not only be official acknowledgment of

the specific cover mechanism employed by CIA but would also

negatively affect the governmental or business mission of

the cover provider,

especially those who provide non-

official cover.

Acknowledgment of an employee who had been

under non-official cover in a host country and possibly in

other countries could have a negative impact on the

interests and activities.

It would also

cast suspicion on that L

Further, exposure of cover providers could

affect the

recruttment and cooperation of such providers by

the Agency and Intelligence Community.

When the CIA notified him that his name appeared in

roleased at that time.

Although not mentioned as an option in your letter, I would like to be

permitted to review the doouments containing my name which you are being obliged

to release. When I retired, I gave up all links with former sources. One of these

popped up in the

last week. Some others may still be alive, and in

need of protection, although as I recall, none had any useful data concerning the

assassination. If the sources are to be exposed, I feel very strongly that thoy are

entitled to all the protection we can afford them. I will be in the Washington D.C.

area in November 1997, and would be willing to review these documents.

In terms of the provisions you cite for exceptions in your letter, (A) I consider

myself a person (Agent?) whose identity ourrently requires protection.

The public disolosure of my name as part of the assassination reoord (C.3)

could reasonably be expooted to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal

privacy, and that invasion is so substantial that it outweighs the public interest, I

cannot resist defining the public interest in this matter as "public morbid curiosity."

The publio disclosure of my name as part of the assassination rocord (C.4)

would probably compromise the existence of an understanding of confidentiality

currently requiring protootion between a government agent and a cooporating

individual or foreign government, and public disclosure would be so harmful that it

outweighs the public interest. I was COS

when the assassination

occurred. I was in close touch withi

time, and with

and we probably interohanged data on the

murder, although they could provide nothing useful. Also, the Station was probably

tasked to query all of our sources on the matter, again with negative results. The

would not only imperil me, but would also einbarrass the

could endanger current activities of the Agency in that country. I do not recall

whether in my subsequent assignmont as Chief of the Cuban Task Force, any

mention of the assassination came up. However, if it did, revelation of my name

could not only imporil those agonts of the time who survive, compromise our

operational methods, but also, mako me a prime target for the Cuban intelligonoe

service.

None of the above should be construed as a waiver of my rights, or those of

my heirs, to take legal action to prevent the release of my name and/or to collect

damages, both civil and punitive, resulting from the release of my name. There

exists an implioit contraot between me and the Agency dating from when I accepted

The Agency undertook

It should be noted that this implicit contract predatos

Public Law 102-526 by some 18 years. Naturally, I am going to inform my legal

advisor of this entire matter. I suggest that you pull together a set of all documents

pertaining to my retirement, so that these can be mado available for his review.

I refrain from comment about a U.S. Congress that would pass such a bill,

and

a President who would fail to veto it. (You of course, are not te-blame.) The

Now York Times and the Washington Post, will, of course, be drooling to got their

hands on your papers. I don't envy you because this is an extremely complicated

matter. Unfortunately, the release on a lot of non-portinent information will go a

long way to reveal the scope and role of the Agenoy in Latin America to any analyst

who wants to review the material and piece it together. I believe that this role is not

significantly different today than it was when President Kennedy was murdered.
