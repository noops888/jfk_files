involvement in this operation.

Since the principal statute involved is under

HART should be conducted as requested by State. It would

appear more appropriate that Customs should conduct such

interview at the proper time during the course of their

investigation; and UACB, no interview will be conducted.

Miami will continue to maintain close liaison

with Customs and will submit LHM, with copy to Customs
