OLG RECORD COPY

Aide Memoire

SUBJECT : Issues in Pending HISCA Subpoenas

1. CIA has restricted access by HSCA representatives to

two sets of documents, which led to the Committee's voting a sub-

poena shortly prior to the recess by the House. Two other items

of information that were included in the subpoena had been reviewed

by HSCA representatives prior to voting the subpoena. So far

as we know no action has yet been taken to serve the subpoena

formally. Its reported date of return is 6 September•

2. The two files on which we have restricted access deal

with two separate subjects, as follows:

a. An operational file involving a sensitive Covert

Action program, in which a person of interest to the

HSCA was one of a number of targets. The HSCA has

reviewed the 201 file of the person in question for the period

January 1973 through May 1964, but the separate operational

file has not been shown. The nature of the operation has

been outlined to Mr. Blakey and his deputy, Mr. Cornwell.

The presentation emphasized the sensitivity of the operation

and its lack of relevance to the HSCA inquiry.

19 b. The history of the Mexico City Station for the period

-1969. It covers all activities of the Station over a period

or ume almost entirely irrelevant to the purpose of the

HSCA investigation. Only a few references in the Mexico

City Station history can be considered relevant to the issue

of President Kennedy's assassination, and these have been

seen by HSCA representatives.

Substantial sections of other

portions of the history have been shown the HSCA Chief

Counsel and Staff Director, Mr. Blakey, and to his deputy,

Mr. Cornwell®

4. The original Memorandum of Understanding, executed in

August 1977, commits the Agency to provide access to material

"that bears upon the study and investigation authorized by

H. Res. 222,

which we see as referring to relevance. It

also recognized the limitations placed on access depending on

"the responsibility of the DCI to protect sensitive intelligence

sources and methods."

An amendment to the original agreement

was negotiated in January 1978, the language of which throws

into question the unqualified right of the DCI to withhold material

because of sources-and-methods considerations, but leaves in-

tact the original position on relevance.

5. Our practice, under these provisions, has been to agree

to requested access to material we feel probably irrelevant, if

it is not judged sensitive. When considerations of relevance

and sensitivity combine we have opposed unqualified access. In

the face of the HSCA representatives' assertion of the need to

verify our statements about relevancy, etc., we have tried to

employ the original commitment to the DCI by Mr. Blakey to

not disclose anything shown him personally, when the matter

becomes an issue, letting him review the material personally.

This serves to demonstrate good faith, at the same time that

it has permitted verification by a selected FISCA person.

6. If the HSCA decides to force the present issue, for whatever

purposes, there would be some confusion in outlining just what

the Agency's position is. The agreements can be presented as

compromising the legislated responsibility of the DCI to protect

sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. This considera-

tion has led us to follow the practice of tying relevance (preserved

in the original agreement) to sensitivity, avoiding assertion of the

right to protect material on the grounds of sensitivity alone. As

an example we have given extensive access to intelligence sources

and methods as employed in Mexico City, where it was relevant

because it explained CIA coverage of the Oswald visit in September-

October 1963 •

7. Discussions with Chairman Stokes, assuming there will

be an opportunity to have such an exchange, should be reasonable

rather than technical. While we believe our grounds sound (the

material at issue is not relevant to the inquiry, and is sensitive) the

arguments in support of it may prove confusing in public controversy.
