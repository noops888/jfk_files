World Reaction to Change of US

Administration

World reaction to the as-

sassination of President Ken

nedy and its aftermath is in-

creasingly preoccupied with

speculation over the possible

effects on US foreign and do-

mestic policies.

Oswald's Communist back-

ground, however, and his dra-

matic murder while in police

custody are being exploited for

almost every conceivable propa-

ganda line. The USSR continues

to reflect

sensitivity over Os

wald's political motivations;

Khrushchev, talking with Am-

bassador Kohler on 23 November,

recalled that Lenin had con-

demned "nihilist" activities

and asserted the Soviet Communist

Party is

• traditionally opposed

to terrorism.

Pravda, citing a denial by

the

US Communist Party that Os-

wald had ever been a member,

suggested he was linked to

"American Trotskyites," but con-

cluded that the Kennedy assas-

sination was the work of "fasc

ist forces" trying to destroy

the

detente atmosphere.

Papers in West Germany,

Belgium, and Lebanon, among

others, theorize Oswald was

killed

by associates to silence

A Cairo newspaper calls

killer "one Jack Rubenstein,

a Jew of course." The US Em-

bassy in Beirut has received

many telegrams speculating that

Oswald's killing is evidence of

the probable foreign impact of

dramatic news photos showing the

escorting officer apparently

looking away while Oswald is

shot.

An Afrikaans paper in

Johannesburg editorialized that

while US racial difficulties

might not be "directly concerned

with the assassination," they

had become a vehicle for the

undermining of the state by the

Communists and Afro-Asians.

A Cairo editorial expresses

concern that President Johnson,

while committed to the policies

of his predecessor, may have to

compromise and postpone decisions

in order to avoid antagonisms

as the US enters an election

year. Syrian Vice President

Bitar commented to Ambassador

Knight on 25 November that the

Arab cause might suffer from

the loss of President Kennedy,

"who had shown signs of increas-

ingly better understanding of

the Arabs

and

I their problems."

West German and French

press commentaries range from

expectations of initial uncer-

tainty or temporizing in US for-

eign policy to the gloomy view

of Der Spiegel that it is "doomed

to immobility" for the next

year.

Some segments of the

British press had suggested

(continued)

that an opportunity existed for

development of a strong British

leadership in the Western alli

ance, but London officials,

noting

that the UK also faces

1964 elections, are not in-

clined to expect any radical

departures.

Genevieve Tabouis, writ-

ing in Paris Jour, expects no

major decisions from the pres-

ent meeting between President

Johnson and General de Gaulle,

but notes that De Gaulle will

probably urge that France-Ameri-

can problems be settled in the

course of 1964, while Johnson

will urge

a "Western summit con-

ference."

The Peruvian Chamber of

Deputies on 24 November unani-

mously adopted a motion urging

the award of the Nobel Peace

Prize to President Kennedy.

Hanoi Apparently Renewing Cam-

South Vietnam

Hanoi appears to be re-

international support for the

"neutralization" of South Viet-

In pressing its neutraliza-

tion proposal, Hanoi probably

hopes to take advantage of Cam

bodian Premier Sihanouk's re-

cent reiteration of his scheme

for an international guarantee

of neutrality for Cambodia,

Laos, and South Vietnam.

The

North Vietnamese reportedly

publicly restated its support

of the three country neutrality

plan. North Vietnam is also

drawing support from Moscow and

Peiping, whose propaganda has

recently become less reticent

on the subject of South Viet-

namese neutrality.

North Vietnam's premier re-

portedly told a French official

recently that his country sees

indications of growing weariness

and dissatisfaction in the US

with the war in South Vietnam.

He implied that Hanoi intended

to keep up military and political

pressure in the South in order

to help induce American with-

EASTERN EUROPE

Rumania's Industrial Development

Rumanian

party first secre-

tary Gheorghiu-Dej has just com

pleted another tour of industrial

construction sites throughout

Rumania--his sixth such trip in

the last two months. The exten-

sive Rumanian press

coverage of

the trip is designed to show

both Rumania's rapid economic

growth and its broadening trade

contacts with the West.

The Rumanian public has

been officially informed for

the first time of the extent

of West European participation

in the construction of indus-

trial installations in Rumania.

It is also the first time that

detailed information has been

given to the public regarding

industrial installations.

Press

coverage divulges statistics on

production capacities. of the

various installations as well

as on the items they produce.

Information on the planning

and construction of the facto

ries also is unusually detailed.

On 13 November the party

visited Slatina, the site of

an aluminum plant whose con-

struction is just beginning.

According to the Rumanian press,

the plant ultimately will have

an annual production capacity

of 50,000 tons of aluminum and

alloys and will be completed in

the next 18 months with help of

a French firm.

Other sources

NBR

indicate, however, that the

French firm is assisting in con-

struction of the first stage of

the plant, which will have a

30,000-ton capacity. ' Equipment

is being provided by several

West European countries, the

press reported.

The Craiova chemical com-

bine will include 14 factories

having a capacity of about 300,-

000 tons of ammonium nitrate

fertilizer and 100,000 tons of

urea, according to

the press

which also reported that the

ammonia, nitric acid, and amno-

nium nitrate factories-planned

and equipped by the USSR-- are

over two thirds completed.

Belgium, Holland, and West

Ger-

many are supplying equipment

for portions of the combine.

From various sources it is

known that during 1960-61 West-

ern firms added several catalytic

refining installations to the

Brazi oil refinery, built in

1934. The Rumanian press now

reports that the Rumanians re-

cently completed construction

of a crude oil distillation

unit with a three-million-ton

capacity.

This unit will boost

the plant's capacity from 1.5

million tons to 4.5 million tons

per year. Brazi is one of the

three major refineries in which

Rumania plans to concentrate

its refining capacity.

also indicated that additional

facilities to be built at Brazi

will include a number of petro-

chemical installations:

ethylene-propylene plant prob-

ably purchased from Italy, a

polyethylene plastics plant from

the Uk, and, an ethylene oxide

and ethylene glycol unit from

Italy.

Brazi, along with another

combine at Borzesti, will be the

main centers for chemical pro-

duction based on petroleum.

Dej also visited numerous

other industrial installations

which have received both Western

and Soviet equipment and assist

ance.

In reporting the progress

of construction at these plants,

however, the Rumanians gave more

attention to the Western assist-

ance than to the Soviet contribu-

tions.

stal sections 77-331

The belated open recognition

of

the Western role in Rumania's eco

nomic development undoubtedly re-

flects Rumania's desire to expand

further its trade ties with the

West.

Rumanian officials have con-

stantly reiterated Bucharest's

interest in purchasing modern tech-

nical machinery and equipment. (SE-

COMMUNIST ASIA

5 :

Peiping Approaches Cambodian

Crisis Carelully

The Chinese Communists are

showing considerable caution

in their reactions to Prince

Sihanouk's apparently unsolicited

outbursts concerning his inten-

sions to turn to them for aid,

although they are attempting to

appear responsive to his position.

In a 21 November government state-

ment, the Chinese carefully

avoided any real commitment to

Cambodia and were studiously

vague about the extent to which

they intend to support Sihanouk.

The Chinese hesitated for

over two weeks before issuing

their statement and they is-

sued it then because of the

pressure of a situation over

which they have no control.

The statement avoids the ques-

tion of economic or technical

aid. It does offer "all-out

support" for Cambodia in the

event of an invasion by the US,

South Vietnam, or Thailand. Even

this high-sounding promise,

however, is carefully hedged

with a preliminary reference to

the 1954 Geneva agreements, sug-

gesting that "all-out support"

would be restricted to propa-

ganda calls for joint action

under the International Control

Commission and would not include

unilateral Chinese Communist

military aid.

While Peiping probably

could supplant US aid to Cam-

bodia, its

enthusiasm is appar-

ently

considerably dampened by

Sihanouk's unpredictability.

The Chinese are well aware that

previous expressions of similar

desires by Sihanouk were used

as pressure tactics to enhance

Cambodia's position. Although

in the present crisis Sihanouk

appears more serious than in

earlier ones, the Chinese are

unwilling to leap in before they

are certain of the outcome.

Viet Cong Activity in South

Vietnam

The accelerated tempo of

Viet Cong activity in the post-

coup period continues.

While the 149 Viet Cong

attacks recorded during the

week ending 18 November are

drop from the previous week's

record high of 233, the number

is still about 50 percent above

the attacks continue to be on

a small scale.

They are tar-

geted primarily against strate-

gic hamlets and outposts, with

government paramilitary forces

bearing the brunt. On 24 No-

vember,

however, a reportedly

large Communist force overran

a post northwest of Saigon

where special forces were

train-

ing under US auspices.

The Saigon government ap-

parently is proceeding with a

purge of military officers

holding high military, intelli-

gence, and provincial posts

under Diem.

On 22 November it

announced the suspension of 31

officers.

Some of these are

under arrest. The purges may

be partly in response to the

demands of student and Buddhist

groups seeking revenge against

prominent figures who sided

with Diem during the Buddhist

crisis. (SECRET)

from Australia worth about $66

million--China's first major

grain purchase for 1964 delivery

The Australian announcement

stated that terms of the sale

were similar to previous Sino-

China's

1963 grain crop will at

most be

no better than last year's medi-

bought last year from the West,
