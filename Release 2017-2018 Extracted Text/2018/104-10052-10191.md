MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM : Walter Raymond, Jr.
Chief, IAD/CAS

SUBJECT : House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA). Request for CIA Files on
Teresa P ro en za Proenza

1. The HSCA has requested the files on Teresa Proenza Proenza
in connection with their investigation into the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy.

2. In consultation with the Principle Coordinator, HSCA,
Mr. Scott Breckenridge, we believe that these files should be
denied since they involve sensitive operational methods. (The
attached MFR at Tab A describes the project. At Tab B is the
name provided to the HSCA.)

3. If the DDO concurs in denying the files to the HSCA,
Mr. Breckenridge will consult with the DDCI and with his
approval present this position to Mr. Blakey. It is likely
that Mr. Blakey will ask Chairman Stokes to contact the DCI.

4. Mr. Charles Anderson, Chief, IAD/CAS/COB, can provide

a briefing or additional details.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT : -Political Action Operations in Cuba ~ The PROENZA
Case all : :

1. Introduction. ©). ee ue Serer cate :
This memorandum sets forth information concerning the

conduct of a series of interlocking non-violent political action
operations against the Cuban government, its internal coalition
_ and its alliance with the Soviet Union mounted in. 1963. :

2. Objectives 68 Ey, oe

Pursuant to instructions from.the 303 Committee,
during.the Kennedy Administration, the CIA established among its
objectives against Cuba the fragmenting of its. governing
coalition and exacerbation of its relations with the USSR. :
This decision was taken prior to the October 1962 Missile Crisis.
As a result of the decision a number of non-violent operations
were carried out. Those pertaining to the Teresa Proenza Proenza
case are set out below..- Seca

,3. The Operations creer eeeae a

a. On 3 April 1963 a set of spurious documents falsely
- ascribed to a disaffected CIA agent in Mexico were passed
h! to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City..
made ap) at the Cuban Vice Minister of
Defense, a highly placed and extreme Moscow-line Communist (who
had been in Moscow when the missile build-up was planned in
- early 1962), was actually a CIA agent who had betrayed the build-
up. The: purpose of this disinformation was to cause a great
strain in the relations between the Cuban Communist Party (then
known as the PSP) and the other partners in the coalition. It

was also hoped that the operation would redound against the USSR t
because the Vice Minister of Defense was a senior Moscow-line :
member of the PSP. It was calculated that. the USSR would i

move to defend the Vice Minister, who was probably their chief . ‘
agent in the Cuban government, and that a collision between the i
Soviets and Cubans could result. The Cubans accepted the

spurious papers and paid for them per our demand. :

b. Through the summer of 1963 several further deliveries
of spurious documents were made to the Cubans and several :
thousand dollars were received in payment. But results of the ‘
operation from inside Cuba were not yet observed. Therefore :
on 13 November 1963, when a delivery of documents was again t

being made, several were included revealing the presence of another
"CIA agent" in the Cuban government, this time inside the Cuban
Embassy in Mexico. This target was Teresa Proenza Proenza,
long-time Cuban Communist and contact of the Soviet intelligence

in Mexico, who was acting as Cuban-Cultural Attache. She also

was a close contact of the Vice Minister of- Defense.

10 December 1963 Miss Proenza was informed of her sudden transfer
back to Cuba; she actually departed on 23 January 1964. Her :
recall was believed.to be a result of the spurious documents and

of her known long- time /friendship a the Vice Minister of Defense.

The first reaction’ to ‘the operation inside Cuba |
occurred fa the week of 14 March 1964... At that time a junior
member of the Communist Party (PSP) was tried and convicted |
of betraying non-Communist leaders of the resistance to. the former
government of Cuba which had been overthrown by Fidel Castro. .~
As the trial wore on it became apparent that since the young
Communist. had been the protege’ of the Vice Minister of Defense
the trial was really a ‘trial of the latter. See

d. During 1964 deliveries. of ‘documents to the Cubans
were continued and payments received. On 18 November 1964
the Vice Minister of: Defense was arrested on charges of .treason

rank: They were jailed as was, Teresa Proenza.

Ee e. After terms in prison all three defendants were
released to house arrest. Proenza was later permitted to work as

bed several years later. His widow was allowed to leave Cuba
to reside in Spain. This phase of the CIA operation wound.
down in March 1966 when the Cubans ceased taking an interest in
it. :

4. Concluding Remarks

The foregoing is but the barest outline of a highly
complex operational system that made use of a wide variety of
techniques and assets which have not been revealed to the public.
The story would make dramatic headlines if it became publicly
known, especially in the present environment. The fact that
several persons were deprived of their freedom as a result of the |
operation would attract further attention. Furthermore, this -
operation laid the basis for other operations of a similar
nature that were successfully mounted against Cuban and other
hostile targets. In short, this file.is a Pandora's box the
opening of which would not only expose the cryptonyms of other
_operations of this type but would attract unfavorable publicity
for the Agency in certain quarters and would expose hitherto
secret techniques and assets. This would make their employment
in the future very difficult. The fact that this series of

operations did not begin to register on the Cubans until after

it could in any way have caused Castro to direct an assassination
