MEMORANDUM FOR: . Deputy. Chief, Operations Staff

SUBJECT : Review of Agency Holdings regarding
Photograph of Unidentified Individual
in ‘Mexico City published by the
Warren Commission

REFERENCE t .Letter dated 15 April 1975 by
Mr. David W. Belin, Executive Director
of. the Commission on CIA Activities
within’ the United States, to” -
Mr. E. Henry Knoche (copy attached to
accompanying report) ,

1. This is further to, and in completion of, my
interim memorandum ofa few weeks ago.

2. The attachment ‘is a detailed review in narrative,
chronological order - together with appropriate comment- ~~
ary - of our extensive holdings on the OSWALD case that’ :*
have a bearing'on the matter of photographs taken by
Mexico City Station on'l, 4 and 15 October 1963 of an
Unidentified Individual. As a consequence of a combina-
tion of analytical error, misjudgement and ‘under the
stress of an urgent desire to contribute to the develop-
ment of the investigation of the assassination, a
cropped version of one of the photographs of the
Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of
evidence in the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an
FBI representative. in Dallas. The successive vicissi-

tudes which have now made this event a cause celebre oS
xight down to the ia moment are detailed in the . . . 4
narrative. 5 : ; ‘

SECRET


13-00000

3.° The attached report is not intended to be an
answer ‘to. the Fensterwald/O'Toole article which Mr. Belin
attaches to his memorandum. (I have prepared a paragraph-
by-paragraph refutation and comment on that article,
which I believe:is more appropriately handled by a sepa-
rate memorandum to:Mr. Belin, and I will prepare this as.
a memorandum,.if that is desired.) -°

4. .The point of. the*referenced memorandum, is that
consideration ‘should be given now to "whether or not the
entire matter can.be' fully disclosed at this time." This.
submission’ is designed to make it possible for you, the
IG and others whom. you may desire to consult to make this
decision. The’ narrative-interpretive summary has heen
put together in’such.a way that it discloses no cyptonyms,
pseudonyms or. other CIA jargon. However, its contents qo
well beyond: what has been released to. the public thus far
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must
be borne in mind in:making a decision on Mr. Belin's
question. To remove any question in. anybody's mind about
our good faith in ‘this matter, the narrative is backed..up
by copies .of actual documentation from our files. It
Seems to-mé necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or
his representative review the documentation that backs up
the narrative." The documentation has not been keyed into
the narrative presentation, but it follows the. chronologi-
cal-order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in-the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: . There
is only one copy of this collection; this is it.)

5. As notéd above, one of the photographs taken in
Mexico City on 4 October 1963 was introduced into the
Warren Commission public record. However, it was intro-
duced into that record in two cropped versions. “The .
Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in
the course of their inquiry at Headquarters and in
Mexico City of the origins of the photograph, the fact
that we had additional photographs of the same individual
taken at different times in Mexico City and on the basis
of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con-
clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to
OSWALD and the. assassination.

fi -

6. In fact, we actually hold twelve different photo-
graphs of the Unidentified Individual. Each of these agte/S
reproduced in the collected documentation backing up the

“narrative report (see Items 25 - 27). Chief, LA’Division,

had indicated in writing to DC/OPS Staff, that he has no
objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with
these photographs at’ this time. ‘It should be noted that ©
Mr. Fenstéerwald in’ 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by
Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the
twelve photographs, other than the one already published
in the Warren’ Commission report. (It is these two that
he has published.in The New York Review of Books article
which Mr. Belin attaches to his memorandum.)

7. It seems to'me that whoever makes ‘a decision on
whether the entire’ matter can be fully disclosed at this
time should. bear in’mind that. a subsidiary decision must.
also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up.
the background’ of the: photographs or, alternatively, to
publish the entire run of the photographs for ‘the first
time without taking out the background.” Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material ©
to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself. I
think they should see the entire documentation as it
stands. ‘Perhaps after that, the question of what could
be discussed ‘andthe question of "how?" and “how much?* :
could be taken: up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation. is ‘that the more we can say about this.
matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off:
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding
that there are still sensitive aspects deriving from the
fact that the operation which produced the photographs
was Bea
publ: cation | at ‘this time would create ‘additional problems
at sphatrkeve EMEKEEO. Also, it should be noted that.
the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to
g.C. King on-22°November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup
documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the
decision to put the photographs into the hands of the PBI
in Dallas laterally from the Field. As far as I know,
there has not been anything published about: this aspect
at any time in‘the past nor have we had any discussions.”
with the State Department about that aspect of the matter...

SUBJECT : | Review of Agency Holdings Regarding Photograph of
Unidentified Individual: in the Warren Commission
‘Report

REFERENCE: Memorandun from David W. Belin to E. Henry Knoche,
: dated 15 April 1975

J. !naecordancé with reference’ request, ‘we: have ‘examined
and summarized ‘the record concerning a cropped photograph that.was
considered: by the Warren Commission in the course of its. investi-
gation. The. photograph .(together with others of the same
individual) originated from an intelligence operation conducted
in October 1963." The photograph is of an individual who to this’
day remains unidentified. Intelligence-did not. provide a photo-
graph of Lee Harvey Oswald during his brief stay in Mexico City
that month, :

2. Under the extraordinary press of effort. to develop infor-
mation on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photo-
graph were made available by CIA's Mexico representative on the
afternoon of.22 November to the local FBI representative. © Later
that day, assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies
were conveyed by:.an FBI representative on a special U. S. Naval.
Attache flight to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use
in the ongoing investigation. One photograph, cropped by the

* FBI, was shown to Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Leé Harvey OSWALD! s
mother) in Dallas on the evening of 23 November 1963 by an FBI
agent. :

3. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of

events that ultimately resulted in Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's



13-00000

allegation thats had been shown a cropped(, acto of Jack RUBY
the day before he murdered her son: A further complication
compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that, when

she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Cciimission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washing-
ton in a slightly different manner.

4.. Although in no. way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or: his
stay in Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the -
morning’ of. 2. October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the
unidentified.man originated during OSWALD's stay there..’. It-is
important, thérefore, to an understanding of the acquisition and
handling of the photographs by the CIA's Mexico representative |
to review what he ascertained and did with the information
developed about oswALD in Mexico City, together. with CIA Head-
quarters action on that information.

5S. From all gtedible evidence known to this time (none,
incidentally, added Since the exhaustive work of the Warren Com-
mission) , Lee* Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and two (2)

_ partial days =- about 116 hours in all -- in Mexico City from
about 10:00 a.m. 27 September 1963 to about 8:30 a.m. 2 October
1963. His place. of ‘residence was a small:commercial traveler
hotel, not frequented by "gringos" -- ‘the Hotel, Connercio -- where
he was registered under alias. Exhaustive and detailed interviews .

+ and interrogation by the Mexican authorities. and the FBI after the
assassination established that, in the recollection of all hotel i

personnel, he left and returned late each day of his stay.



13-00000

6. ‘Allowing Gor the fact of late arrivh. and early departure,
and assuming that he slept one-third of the time of his stay
(38 or 39 hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity to.be
accounted for.” Overall, CIA's information can ‘account only for
very brief periods during 28, 29. September and 1 October.

7. It:should be’noted that OSWALD was. in no sense. "under
investigation.” None of the facts of his. defection and‘stay in
the USSR and return to. the U. ‘s., 1959-1962, were known. to CIA's
Mexico representative before 10 October 1963, On that date, the
bare bones of Oswald's biography were forwarded by Headquarters in
response to a cabled report of 8 October which had forwarded, on
a routine basis, what appeared to be a contact by an American for
a-visa to Cuba’in transit to the USSR. This was indicated and
deduced from information acquired on 1 October, which was ‘the first
and only occasion on that visit in, which OSWALD was recorded as
identifying himself. (partially) by true name.

8. At no time during his stay.in Mexico City did the CIA.
acquire a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage was
conducted on 22 and'23 November 1963 after the assassination,
including materials back to August 1963. This confirmed that there
was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his Mexico
trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a
cabled request on 15 October,: the CIA's Mexico representative had
no photo of OSWALD.in his records, nor did he receive one from,
Headquarters -- which did not have one either -- before 22 November

1963. et



13-00000

9. 1t must $. stressed that what inforhution there was
had not been (and normally is not) processed in "real time."
The means of acquisition and the volume of the information
preclude anything but the spot reporting of items judged to
be of more than’ ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in
summary logs. Photo coverage tended to become available in
quantity lots which requires scanning and selection on.a rapid
and accelerated basis in.fouz ‘or five day "peaks." One of the
"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more

speedy review:and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is

_, the identification of a person's name... This was precisely what

occurred on.1 October.’ It was this information reported’ to Head--
quarters in its first reference on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

10,. The “CIA's Mexico representative did one more thing in~
his. 8 October xeport. on Lee OSWALD based on the 1 October infor-
mation: he coupled the data with descriptive inférnation dequired
from a sensitive. ‘source +~ a photograph of. a nale individual,
apparently an ‘American, who was observed entering an Enbassy
on 1 October. “This detail was reported on the 8th as a matter of :
coincident fact. CIA's, Mexico representative did not assert or
suggest that the data led to any deduction that the photo was in
fact OSWALD or, indeed, was in any'way related to OSWALD.

11., One additional element of background must be stipulated
now as the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or
irrelevance) of the photo of the unknown individual placed in the
chain of evidence on 23 November in Dallas by the FBI agent:

what was the totality of CIA Mexico's eeereee of OSWALD's activity

13-00000

‘as of the wees of the 23rd when all sehae coverage
"had been checked? / .

12. The totality of this coverage on or reasonably
inferable to. be. OSWALD was read ‘by, ‘discussed with, and
examined by Warren Commission staffers in Headquarters and in
Mexico. City. during” a stay from 8-13 April 1964. All were made

13. . At_ about mid-day on 1 October, the camera registered

the entry into an Embassy of a white-shirted individual.” In the
opinion of CIA's Mexico representative, among all the persons
photographed that. day, he appeared to be the. only non-Latin’and
possibly American: who entered. On the chance that there could be
an association between the identification data derived from
eoversea and the descriptive data derived from the photograph,
the two-elements. were reported as separate facts in the cable to
Headquarters on 8 October.

14, This action was not unusual and really. amounted to an
analytic "quantum leap," in terms-of the primitive status of
the OSWALD identification. Many examples of a similar kind of..
thing ‘can be found in the day-to-day record’ of Mexico City
Headquarters correspondence and reporting. . we

15.. On 22 November 1963 CIA's Mexico I he cabled
Headquarters at 2229Z time after learning of the arrest of Lee H.
OSWALD, age 24, possibly in connection with the assassination;
and referenced its earlier messages ‘of 8-9 and 15 October and

Headquarters’ reply of 10 October. This cable requested by



13-00000

priority pouch a photo of OSWALD so that a check could be

tiade of "all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forwarding soonest
copies of only.visitor on 1 October who could be identical with
OSWALD." :

16. . This obviously was for comparison at the CIA Mexico
City office which had estimated the age of. the unidentified. male
whose photograph. it had sélected as having the “apparent' age of
35,0 0 oa ES : E :

17.. A dispatch was prepared in accordance with the indication
given in the cable of 22 November.” The dispatch noted. that photo
coverage-of the unidentified individual had turned up on’ 4 and :
15 October. The text of the 22 Novenber: 1963 pouched. dispatch

read:

Attached are copies of the only photographs

obtained... on 1 October 1963 which appeared to be
an American: This samé.nan ‘visited [an] Embassy on

U.S. Ambassador on 22 November 1963 and a copy of

inserted after typing of dispatch. » These were taken
