STAFF

COMMENTS: FI and CI Staffs concur in renewal.

FI STAFF: FI/INT points out that the project 1s

reporting

phone tap operation, in terms of volume, of all

our tap efforts.

Cuban reporting and that con-

nected

with President Kennedy's trip to Mexico

were of especial value.

STAFF: Concurs with Station's plan to move the

intercept center for the reasons stated.

The proj-

activity is bound to become of interest to

various

opposition elements and the Station is well

advised

to make necessary changes to provide for

and

Improve on the security of the operation.
