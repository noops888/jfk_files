4. The point of ene Qs renced memorandum is that
consideration should be given now to “whether or not the
entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time." This glele
submission is designed to make it possible for you, the
IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this
decision. The narrative-interpretive summary has been
put together in such a way that. it discloses no cyptonyms, H
pseudonyms or other CIA jargon. However, its contents ao
well beyond what has been released to the public thus far
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must
be borne in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's
question. To remove any question in anybody's mind about
our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up
by copies of actual documentation from our files. It i
seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or :
his representative review the documentation that backs up |
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into Hl
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi- |
eal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest \
developments in the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: There
is only one copy of this collectig@.this is it.]

7. It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on
whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this
time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must
also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up
the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to
publish the entire run of the photographs for the first
time without taking out the background. Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material
to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself. I
think they should see the entire documentation as it
stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what could
be discussed and the question of "how?" and "how much?"
could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation is that the more we can say about this
matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding
that there are still sensitivé aspects deriving from the
fagt that the operation which prodyged the photographs
was Gointly ran with Mexican lia}
publication at this time would

the Ambassador, according t We R

decision to put the oe the hands of the FBI

there has not been 1g shed about this aspect
at any time in the p CS ‘e we had any discussions
with the State Department mut that aspect of the matter.
