Vietnamese were poorly prepared to fight a war with their
present weapons. Ile said they were holding cut in the hi

President of the United St: 6 is confused and perplexed by the
present happenings in Viet i « LOPICO stated that the regime
in Viet Nan, which is costing the Capitalists of the Un
States millions of dollars, not controlling the Buddhist
monks as well aw the Inperlialists of the United States would
like them, Me claims that the Vietnamese want to ‘be a
socialist state and the United States will not let this
happen, The situation in Viet Nam is getting out of hand and,
therefore, the President sent his representative to plead and
beg the VietnazB to control the Buidhists more to the United
States liking. :

Speaker LODICO said that the financing of this
unorganized regime is not by the people or by United
‘Nations or by the President, but by only one man in the C. la,
He says that the people of the United States will eventually
squawk about the tax dollars which are being spent.

PAUL LODICO spoke about Viet Nam and America! s
role and how mistaken America is, We said America pretends
to be big politically when all the time she is
working to maintain American Tuperialism when a foreign
country wants to turn to Socialism. [Me said America likes ~
its role in Viet Nam as it gives then a chance to try out
new military weapons, He said the only way for America: to

stop playing its present stupid role is for America to
turn to Socialism,

He stated that the unions are some of the biggest
forces that protect discrimination against the Negro.

Capitalism is the thing that protects these
sices of discrimination against the Negro and this is
n the unions that are dedicated supposedly to the pro~
n of the Negro as a people. The only way to end this
practice is to end its cause, and that is the Capitalistic
system.

Gradually the Negro is coming out of his second
class citizenship standing and is taking his place among the.
upper classes of society. This struggle should serve to
prove that the laboring man can throw off the shackles of
eppression and demand of the leaders of labor the rightful
place of the working class in the affairs of the nation
and the world. —

BREITMAN stated that Socialsn is an ally of the
‘Negro in this struggle. The program of true Socialism has
been in the forefront of the fight for Negro rights ever
Since this fight began. Socialism re fuses to stand for any
second class citizenship amoug all peoples. It recognizes
one class and recognizes only one enemy and the enemy is
Capitalism, : i

ROBERT HI centered his speech mainly around
the role that Labor should be playing in the giving of help to
the Hegro struggles in the North as AL as in the South.
The unions have a great amount of prejudice right in their
own ranks and should first of all clean house. The whites
do have much to add to this struggle and the record of the
Socialist Workers Party is one of providing this leadership
whe:rever and whenever possible, Responsibility for the plight
of the Negro in this present struggle rests with the white
MAD.

In concluding RIIML said "the Negro is g ing tired
of waiting for freedom and wants freedom now. The Negro of
today wants all Negro organizations with Negro leaders to
bring about equality. The Negro cannot hope to attain
their goals unless theirs becomes a revolutionary movement
and overthrows the present system that made them slaves in the
first place’

NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO AID THR BLOOMINGTON STUDENTS

The May 19, 1963, issue of “fhe Indianapolis Star", an
Indianapolis daily newspaper, contained an article relating that
the Committee to Aid the Bloomington Students (CABS) has been formed
as an outgrowth of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). The article
related that the CABS was a fund raising unit dedicated to obtaining
funds for the defense of three YSA members indicted under Indiana's
1951 Anti-Subversive Law.

A source advised on September 23, 1963, that a YSA document
entitled “Tasks and Perspectives for the New York Local" (Y¥SA) dis-
closed during September, 1963, that a National Committee to Aid the
Bloomington Students had been set up in New York City. This document
stated that the National CABS in New york City would coordinate and
direct the CABS activities throughout the country.

On February 11, 1964, a second source advised that the
primary purpose of the CABS, organized and controlled by the YSA,;
was to raise funds for the legal defense of YSA members indicted
at Bloomington, Indiana. Source stated that the secondary purpose
of this Committee was to propagandize the Bloomington defense and
utilize this case as an introduction to the aims of campus recruit-
ment.

The second source further advised that the Socialist
Workers Party (SWE) exercises indirect control of the CABS through
control over the YSA leadership which operates the CABS. According
to this source, CABS work by SWP members, who are not YSA members,
is considered as Party work and as a means of building the SwP.

The April 13, 1964, issue of "The Militant", a weekly
SWP newspaper, page 5, disclosed that on March 20, 1964, the
indictments of the YSA members, mentioned above, were dismissed,
The article further relates that the National CABS, however, was
continuing to operate in regard to the solicitation of contributions
to fight an appeal of the dismissal of indictments made by the
prosecution. . :

W. EB. B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERTCA (DCA)

A source has advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a
conference of members of the Communist Party (CP), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the establishment of a new national
Marxist-orlented youth organization which would hunt for the most
‘peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates to this meeting were
cautioned against the germ of anti-Soviet and anti-CP ideologies.
These delegates were also told that it would be reasonable to assume
“that the young socialists attracted into this new organization would
eventually pass into the CP itself. :

A second conference of over 20 persons met in Chicago
on December 28-29, 1963, for the purposecf initiating a “call”
to the new youth organization and planning for a founding convention
to be held in June, 1964.

A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964, at
150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which ‘time the
name W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted. Approximately

500 delegates from throughout the United States attended this convention. -

The aims of this organization, as set forth in the preamble to the
constitution, are, "It is our belief that this nation ean best solve its
problems in an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament
and true freedom for all peoples of the world, and that these solutions
will be reached mainly through the united efforts of all democratic
elements in our country, composed essentially of the working people
allied in the unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites.

We further fully,recognize that the greatest threat to American
democracy comes from the racist and right wing forces in coalition

with the most reactionary sections of the economic power structure,
using the tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy the unified
struggle of the working people. As young people in the forces struggli
for democracy, we shall actively strive to defeat these reactionary

and neo-fascist elements and to aciieve complete freedom ‘and democracy
for all Americans, thus enabling each individual to freely choose and
build the society he would wish to live in. Through these struggles

| As of October, 1965, the headquarters of the DCA was
‘located at 954 McAllister Street, San Francisco, California.

Over the Labor Day weekend, 1965, the DCA held a
conference in Chicago, Illinois. According to a third source,
anew slate of national officers was elected at this conference,
which included Chairman HUGH STERLING FOWLER, II (who, according
to the third source, attended a CP cadre encampment held at Camp
Midvale, New Jersey, in June, 1965, and following his election as
Chairman of the DCA, attended another national CP cadre youth
conference held on September 9-12, 1965, on a farm located in Northern
Indiana, according to a fourth source); Director of Publicity CARL
ELLENGER BLOICE (sho was elected to the San Francisco County Committee
CP in April, 1964, according to a fifth source); Educational Director
MATTHEW “DyNaMiTe” HaLLINAN (who in June, 1964, was stated to be the

FARRELL DOBES gave the first of a two part lecture

on the subject "Building the Revolutionary Party." DOBBS
started his talk by saying that the SWP has three goals of a

. political nature; aligning the United States with world
socialism, defending the interest-or the exploited masses
against capitalism at home, and teaching and leading the
workers of the United States for the abolition of capitalism.
We spoke on reformism and stated that the SWP will oppose any
change in the political objectives and must be thoroughly
trained for combat. He stated that a massive counter-revolutionary
war is being waged by the United States al11 over the world but
that they cannot continue to be the world's watchdog forever.
He stated that the world-wide revolutionary movement has
suffered major setbacks in many areas, but at the same time an
indication of the imperialist downfall is the mass protest
of the war in Vietnam. He stated that this is the first time
in the history of the United States that any segment of the
population in numbers has protested the waging of war while
war is going on. DOBBS stated that it is the need of the Party
to keep recruiting students into the SWP and that as the Negroes
become more militant and more politically aware to recruit
them into the SWP. Im conclusion, DOBBS stated that the political
approach of the SWP is to aim for the conquest of power from the,
capitalist class to a socialist form of government in the 7
United States by the working class, During a discussion at the
conclusion of DOBBS' speach, NORMA LODICO asked DOBBS whet he
meant when he said that the struggle between capitalism and
socialism would be a fierce struggle. He replied that the
capitalist class in the United States would not give up easily

_ and would employ every tactic known to squelch the overthrow
of thals system so consequently, as shown in the past history of
the United Sfates it will be a fierce battle to overthrow
capitalism in the United States in order to substitute socialism.

country but there will have to be world revolution, and that

REVOLUTIONARY. ACTION MOVEMENT

On November 3, 1964, a source made available a document
entitled, "The Revolutionary Action Movement Manifesto", the
document having been obtained by the source from an individual
Known to be a member of the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM).

This document stated, in part, that RAM was officially
organized in the Winter of 1963 by Afro-Americans who support the
revolutionary objectives of ROBERT F, WILLYAMS, now residing in
Cuba, and his concept of organized violence to achieve the liberatio
of the Afro-American people in the United States. This Manifesto
disclosed that RAM had oriehted its program to one of education
and political revolution and the organization of a "black"
political party with revolutionary objectives, having recognized
the need for a “black revolution! that could and would seize
power. RAM philosophy is described in this document as one of
revolutionary nationalism, that is, one involving the struggles
of the non-white races of the world against exploitation and
enslavement by the white capitalist and imperialist nations.

Regarding WILLIAMS, it should be noted that on August 28,
1961, a Federal warrant was issued at Charlotte, North Carolina,
charging him with Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution for the
erime of kidnapping. Subsequent to the issuance of this warrant,
WILLIAMS fled the United ‘States to Guba, where he now publishes
a@ monthly newsletter entitled, "The crusader" from Havana.

cee This source in September, 1964, advised RAM is dedicated
to the overthrow of the capitalist system in the United States,
by violence if necessary, and to its replacement by a socialistic
system oriented toward the Chinese communist interpretation of
"Marxism-Leninism. RAM is entirely non-white in membership,

clandestine in nature, and owes its primary allegiance to the
Bandung World", that is, the non-white races of the world rather
than to any national entity, as such.

On November 16, 1964, a second source advised he learned
recently from a RAM member that the organization began in Detroit,
Michigan, largely under the impetus of DON FREEMAN, deseribed

as the "Father" of RAM and referred to as RAM's “Black Stalin." :
FREEMAN served as RAM Chairman with MAXWELL STANFORD, now of :
New York City, formerly of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, serving 4
as RAM Field Chairman. i

eau On 3/18/65, a third source advised that Hanif Abdul
| Wahab of Cleveland, Ohio, occupies a position in the RAM only
one or two places removed from the top RAM leadership.

On 5/16/66, a fourth source advised that. the RAM y
stall remains active; however, there is no formal headquarters,
as such, for RAM. This source further advised that so far
as is known, FREEMAN, STANFORD and WAHAB still occupy positions
of jeadership in RAM. :

Re: Norma Joan Lodioc

You are authorized to conduct necessary investigation
involving persons connected with educational institutions unless
‘your office is aware of a possible problem at a particular school.
Ho such contacts are to be made on campuses except as provided in
SAC Letter 67-29, Should a problem exist or should it be felt any
other interview on a campus is necessary, furnish the Bureau full
details together with your recommendation for specific Bureau
authority. It is incumbent upon each office to insure that
such investigations involving persons connected with educational
institutions are handled py mature personnel to avoid possibile
embarrassment to the Bureau. All persons interviewed must be
advised that the Bureau is conducting a background investigation
of the captioned individual who is an applicant or employee of 4
the Federal Government to preclude any assumption that the
investigation is of a criminal or security type.

APPENDIX

FREEDOM SOCIALIST PARTY OF WASHINGTON,
Also Known as Freedom Socialist Party (FSP)

In April, 1966, a source advised that the
members of the Seattle Branch, Socialist Workers Party
(SWP), executed a statement of resignation from the
National SWP dated April 3, 1966, and temporarily
adopted the name Freedom Socialist Party of Washington,
also known as Freedom Socialist Party (FSP). Their
disagreement with the National SWP was over the questions
of the Negro struggle, the-colonial revolution, the
Vietnamese War, regroupment, women's emancipation, and
party organizational principles.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to
LIxecutive Order 16450.

The source further advised that at a convention
on July 3, 1966, the group adopted the name FSP of Washington,
and became a membership organization.

In August, 1966, the source furnished the August 5,
1866, issue of "The Freedom Socialist", self-described as
the "Voice of the FSP of Washington". This publication
states, "We are a new revolutionary socialism organization",
that is comprised of the former Seattle Branch, SWP, "“indi-
vidual independent radicals who were part of the 1964 united
socialist electoral coalition which created the FSP", and
"A new segment of radical youth who have recently adopted

‘Marxism as their political philosophy".

In December, 1967, a second source stated the FSP
split in November, 1967, following the expulsion of RICHARD
FRASER and a walkout of approximately half of the membership
in sympathy with him. This group formed the FSP Emergency
Committee. The FSP Emergency Committee, which had control
of the publication funds, established headquarters at the
home of FRANK KRASNOWSKY, 3117 East Thomas Street, Seattle,
with ALFRED PEPPARD .as Organizer. Both groups maintained
they were the FSP.

On October 26, 1972, the first source advised that
CLARA FRASER is the Organizer Sr the FSP and that this
organization exists in name only.
