(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

(April 1947 \(oy Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson IIT (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to AaReSSIR
exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy, This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo od surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation. g

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

if they telked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the kelp

devices, These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was bei

puolic by the Warren Cosmission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby. The property vas sold (under an operational agreenent with LIMOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). - LILYRIC was planned es ah alternate we to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on tl le of the street

the front gate of the Soviet Enbas; aN in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both
Vexican fanilies) as fer a fre not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented 2 LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Enbassy compound
which the Mextco Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Enbassy compound. The purpose of this operetion ves to get good
identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (vho at thet time vere largely
unidentified in Mexico Station records), The three photo sites vere handled by
(Renon Alvares)(vexican citizen of U.S. nother{uho taught eleestery lovel at )

and LILYRIC three times e week. His sister's husband, (Carlos (He:

from LICALLA, The two houses in between were rented to unsusrecting tenants.

dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars end a

3. Yy menory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Exbassy but I
think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New
Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a akeshift arrangerent of volunteers
through most of 1960 end 61 with Tom Hezlitt producing voluminous reports on
their activities and recruitirg agents right and left anong Cuban nationals in
Mexico City.

4. Personnel assignments. Of interest to us now is who was in Mexico during
the period prior to Oswald's visit and the subsequent investigation by the

Warren Commission, To dete:

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

_-Russian conversations among the wembers of the Soviet Ecbessy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the stetion
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

the photographs as soon as we learned thet the man calling himself Oswald was
probably an Anerican, However, here again there was a backlag because the
photos were picked up three times a week but the ones picked up were usually
for dates a few days prefiously because (the doctor) processed the film on a
night time basis. Photogrephs were made usually until one roll vas used but
later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious. The Cuban
enbessy coverege had more sophisticated equipsent (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently develosed reckanicel difficulties, Bob Zesbarnerdi and (Spather )

(I think) handled this film - pickup end delivery. Lorna !‘ecKay screened

the film inside the station.

I am certain thet the Osvald call came to our attenion from the
Soviet line. It was picked up end teken to Boris ge because
the caller was trying to szeak “eh ewe fused by waiting to
compare the photographs with po pt. There were no copies of
