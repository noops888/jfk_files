MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

16-3

SUBJECT: Agee Effort Against Cuban Operations

ala

1. Elsie I. SCALETTI recalls that Raymond A. FRADYER, Chief of

the Cuban Section, tried to get Agee to discuss the development of contacts

with access to the Cuban target in the Olympics. In these discussions it may

well be that Agee was told about LIARM-1, L

who was a contactfof the Station and we were trying to get invited to Cuba.

(LIARM-1 is no longer a contact of the Station even though he is still with

• 2.

SCALETTI recalls the Cuban Section feeling very frustrated that

Agee could provide lù leaus úi assistance io this section in its effurt iù larget

against the Cuban teams. She recalls no memoranda prepared by Agee for the

Section, no leads given the Section, and he came to discuss the olympics with

C/Cuba not more than half a dozen times.

3. As SCALETTI recalls, it is unlikely that Agee knew any thing abour

the operations being run against the Cuban target than that which he might have

picked up at Headquarters or known about the Station operations in general -

such as audio, surveillance, photo surveillance, etc.

4. SCALETTI had Agee over to her home once for dinner; there were

no other guests. Agee had SCALETTI, her husband, and Laura d. UTSte

(on TDY) to his apartment once for dinner. The conversation was alwayslo e ZErr

light. The only significant thing about Agee's plans which arose was his

discussion about buying used drycleaning equipment in the United States,

bringing it to Mexico and setting up a drycleaning plant. This was brought

up as something for the future and just an idea Phil was toying with.

5. SCALETTI ran into Agee by chance on the side street by the Embassy

one day alter the arrival John A. PROBERT. Agee said he understood

PROBERT had arrived as COS. and he wouid like to say hello. I suggested

he call PROBERT. I immediately informed PROBERT of my chance encounter

with Agee, and informed PROBERT that Agee had resigned under somewhat

of a cloud and suggested he get briefed himself on Agee's assignment in Mexico.
