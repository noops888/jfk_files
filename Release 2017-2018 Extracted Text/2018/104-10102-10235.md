OPERATION "LEONARDO",

~- OBJECTIVES:

_ To establish contact with elements
within the Government, Rebel Army and Militia, in order to
panalize into action their present anti-communist feeling
and ‘tnduca those who maintain a passive attitude but. who
are potentially susceptible to turn against the Regine,
to act now.. The future Plan of action and the size and de-
velopment of the present operation would be determined af-

_ ter first contacts are made and information thus gathered,

is evaluated. . However, "Leonardo" should be considered os
merely a first step towards coordination of anti-Castro
elements within the. Cuban Government, tor producing an in-
ternal upheaval.

It ig the opinion of people with con-

: tacts in Cuba,-that the moment to act is now, because the

conditions for action are ripening steadily. Reliable in-
formation from the Island points out to the gradual inter-
nal softening of the Castro Regime, to tensions existing
among its members, and to the effect President Kennedy's
words had in the highest governmental Cuban circles who
are said to have acknowledged with sympathy his phrase
that "I am confident that all over the island of Cuba, in
the Government itself, in the Army, in the Militias, there
are. ‘Hany head ++. have viewed with dismay the destruction

of freedom faith and who are determined to restore that

freedom so that Cuban people may once more govern themselves".

"This phrase is the leit-motif of “Leonardo”.

Dr. Nestor Moreno 41, and Miguel Diaz y Selgue 23, would
use one-of the fishermen (who are known to be willing to
work against Castro and had worked with them before), to go
to the mainland and proceed to Cardenas with the message to
arrange 8 meeting with Comandante Ramon Guin or a person he
designates. The round trip to Cardenag might take two or
three days. If conditions are favorable and a meeting can
be arranged at once, the two men would go inland. However,
if the rendézvous with Cuban contacts cannot take place
immediately, they would have to return to Key Sal or any
other base and go back on the date or dates previously fixed
by the message. Through Comandante Guin, who works in INRA_
and travels around the country, and through anti-Castro. ormy,
and civilian elements already active in Cardenas and Marti,
the following army officers would be contacted initially:

Comandante Guerra, Comandante Parra, Comandante Jose Pinares,

“It 4s considered that although the major-
ity-of officials whom the participants of the missions Plan
to talk to have no political ambitions and will act against
Castro for purely Adeological reasons, mininum of assurances
and promises have to be offered. It is also a concensus of
-epinien; that once initial steps are successfully accomplished
an additional number of persons shou]d be used for the devel-
opment of "Leonardo", working always in operational coordin-
ation, Each of them are known to have friends within the

Cuban Government and their Personal and representative
