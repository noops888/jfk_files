facilities, covers and operations, idotably “~~
those in the maritime infiltration field.

c. The creation of a climate which
“fim the long run coulé lead to comtinuing

Gamage to Agency interesta and which would
fender the execution of operations against ©
Cuba and certain sther targe especially
tho Caribbean countries, more difficult and
more costly (by virtue of the necessity of

operational techniques and facilities employed by JUWAVE
in the past, as vell as the identity of a number of forner
agents of the JMAVEK Station. Althouzh, by extrapolations
and br embroidering on information and rumors circulating
in the Cuban exile comunity Cabeza probably could present
@ picture of JMMAVE activity which might appear exciting
to the layman, it seems unlikely that he bas access to any
Significant amoust of information concerning sensitive
current activities. While to the knowledgeable person,
within the Agency or within the federal community im Miami,
Cabexza's information is likely to be untmpreasive, there
Seens to be little doubt that he could--as he has done om
& mumber of occasions curing the past two years--preseat

@ picture of JNVAVE activity which might iatrigue the
@emeral public. It is impossible to predict whether Cabeaa
would present the Agency in © unfavorable Light or whether

be would choose to concentrate his criticiea against other
federal ageacies. -

reference also are in & position to make allegations
Concerning various Agency activitios, includiag JM¥AYE

fields, aad Agency operations apainat the Haitian target.

It is inocesible to state how mch accurate information

OMWAVE/JMOCZAN, In summary it is'most unlikely thet aay
future good would result from a tricl of Masferrer aad/or -
any of his associates, and it is highly probable that there
would be created a climate which would make JMWAVE
operations--of all types--aore difficult to carry.out ip

& secure and economical manner, This is not to Say that
SWHAVE would have to gu out of business, This was not the
ease in the "Zenith" flap, nor is it likely to be the case
with Masferrer, Howover, there appears to be little doubt
that the threshold .! sensitivity:to Agency activities on
the part of the general public and of those persoas who,
from whatever motives, question the advisability of the
Agency “operating” withia the 0.8, would be raised.

11, The question of using Cesar Diosdado as &
prosecution witness presents additional probleas. Diosdade
has been retained as the Customs officer at Key Vest at
the request of the .;enoy. Tho Agency reimburses Cuctoss
for Dicsdade's salary, Because of bis eacyclopedic knowledge
of Cuba and the Plorida Keys aren and because of bis long
fevolvenent in “operational activities” by the Agency, and
by ACBI.om occasion, Uicadado ig considered by many exiles-
wand sous officizis--an being “a Company (Agency) man,” If
Questioned under oath Uivsdade presumab:y would bave to
Yeovea) details of his ageociation with the Agency, actions
¢akea on bensif of the Agency, and conceivably detaila of
SMUAYR oporatioas, In certain instances, notably regarding
ourréat operations and ceveral highly sensitive past
operations, the reveiation of detailed informatios, especially
concerning agont i tities end. operational tecnaiques, crulé
be quite damaging. Yoseibly Diosdado could be carefully
briefed concerning the uature of his teatisoay so as to avoid
perjury while not uiving sengitive data, Huvever, his nature
fis euch that a reasonavly clever defense counsel could provoxe
kim into either indinoretions or contradictions whica would

resent hin, the U.4, Customs and the Agency in sa uafavorable
ight. The fact that Diosdado has been repeatedly commended
by Custons and exilea for his efficient and hueese handling
of refugees and ssanpees would count for little im a courte
yoou where the emotions of the Masferrer fisaco would be
punaing high. :

12, A further problea could arise from the fact that
Dlosdado played # leading role in the investigatios of the
Mastorrer affair, inaluding previous abortive attempts by
the Masferrer and Haitian exiles to launch operations from
Floris, and the feat that biosdado yersonally (acting is
his official capacity am Customs Agent resident at Key Keat)
ed the raid againgt the house.at which the exiles vere

Stteetes and tae «res confiscated. The defense might well
accuse Diosdado of having acted not only for the 0.8,
Customs but also on behalf of the Ageucy,

13. Im addition to the foregoing points it should be
soted that historically the siailarity of this operation
aad the “Bay of Pigs” could reopen the whole question and
offer a new discussion of the prisoser exchange question.

Amvelved with Masferror and potential defencamts are of the
Begro race. If Kasferrer is brougat te trisl, the public
eyupathy, Mri Will probably be reflected in the jury's
verdict would undoubtedly rest with the defeadoat not. the
progecution., A large percentage of the people esdoubtedly
view Masferrer’s activities as efforts to rid the testera
