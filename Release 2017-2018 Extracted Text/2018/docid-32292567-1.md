ADMINISTRATIVE

CG 7016-PC is a leader of organized crime, whose

identity is known to the

Bureau.

On March 9, 1967, contact

was made with him by SA WILLIAM F. ROEMER, JRo It is the

normal procedure of this source to evade direct questions

put to him, but to be generally responsive when conversation

is directed into general matters of investigative interest

in areas where it is known the source is knowledgeable.

However, inasmuch as his answers in response to this tech-

nique are not specifically responsive to any question asked,

the information which he provides is therefore subject to

interpretation and conclusions by the contacting Agent.

I'herefore, the information provided by this informant in

this instance is placed on the administrative pages, rather

than in the body of this report.

On March 9, 1967, through conversation of CG 7016-PC,

it was determined that GUS

ALEX, LESLIE KRUSE and RALPH PIERCE,

with HY GODFREY assisting were at that time interested in

defeating the bill generally referred to as the "Stop and

Frisk Bill" which was at that time pending in the Illinois

State General Assembly. It is noted that this bill would

authorize local police in Illinois to stop any person they

reasonably believe may have just committed a crime or was

about to commit one and obtain from that person his identity

and an explanation for his conduct.

The bill would also

provide permission to allow a search for a weapon. From

the conversation of the source at that time, it appeared

that ALEX, PIERCE and KRUSE, who formerly worked under the

direction of MURRAY L. HUMPHREYS, were now engaged on behalf

of organized crime in the function of establishing and main-

taining contacts with public officials, members of the judiciary,

law enforcement officers and members of organized labor so

that whenever favorable treatment is desired from any members

of these groups such might be obtained. It is noted that

HUMPHREYS formerly had this function and used ALEX, PIERCE

and KRUSE in this regard.. It is believed that when HUMPHREYS

died on November 23, 1965, this function was

then taken over

by these three leaders of organized crime in the Chicago area.

1.

A letter dated May 15, 1965, from Dr. Iur.

HUGO ROSENSTIEL and DI. Iur. ANDREAS GIRSBERGER,

8011 Zurich, Talstr. Il, who appear to have

been ALEX'S

former legal representatives in

Lurich.

This letter forwards a birth certifi-

cate for AlEx, a police certificate stating

that ALEX had no police record in Evergreen

Park, Illinois, and a police certificate stating

that ALEX

had

no criminal record in Cook

An article from the April 28, 1965, No. 18

constituent and friend whom he had known for

25 years.

states senator, to the swiss authorities,

in

which he stated that it was his understanding

that ALEX had no criminal record whatsoever,

and that despite this, ALEX had been denied

entry into Switzerland on the basis of criminal

behavior of an undesired foreigner.

Senator

DIRKSEN asked that ALEX be informed of the

basis for this action on the part of the Swiss

authorities,

and asked that the Swiss govern-

ment reconsider its decision.

196hed statement of ALEX dated October 20,

in which he explained that the discrep-

ancies in his birth date were caused by an error

on the

part of the midwife who delivered him.

He denied ever having been a bodyguard for

anyone, and stated that he was not responsible

for rackets in the Chicago underworld, nor

WAS

he a

gang leader.

He added that he was not

the owner of, nor did he have an interest in

any gambling casino, legally or illegally

operated, nor had he ever taken over the De

Luxe Cigarette Company•

With regard to accusations in the "Spiegel"

article, he had never been a vice-president

of the Cosa Nostra, and was not nor had he been

one of GIANCANA's directors in the syndicate.

He was not a capregima in the syndicate and was

yne eate and was

not nor ever had been in the past connected

with prostitution.

SAM and MAE TAYLOR are his brother and sister-

offense against the laws of the State of

Illinois or any other state, except for minor

6.

to be ALEX's present legal counsel, to the

Swiss authorities stated that his client claims

never to have done anything which was not allowed

or which would make him undesirable in Switzerland.

If ALEX had had illegal gambling halls, why

hadn't the authorities prosecuted him?
