ADMINISTRATIVE:

The Los Angeles Division in its efforts to penetrate

Into the Italian underworld has, since the submission of the last

report, developed a live source, LA 4412-C-TE,

who has now

maneuvered himself into a position where he is In dally contact

with SALVATORE LOUIS PISCOPO. As

aresult of this activity, the

Los Angeles Division has now been able to ascertain that PISCOPOs

who 1s Intimately associated with NICK GUST SIMPONIS, a Greek

gambler in the Los Angeles area, evidently is a member of a

New York family though he himself has been in the Los Angeles

area

tor a period of some 20 years having been brought here by JOHNNY.

ROSSELLI to participate with ROSSELLI and WILLIE

ABIOFP in the

ola theatrical union wherein ROSSELLI and BIOFF were convicted

for shaking down the movie industry.

On 11/30/52, EISCOPO departed the los Ageles aren

supposedly at the request of his boss in New York

and this infor-

mant mentioned above was able to determine from PISCOPO that in

his New York trip the family which PISCOPO was a member of had a

new

boss who

was young and who nad succeeded an old and sick man.

The

association of PISCOPO with MICHAEL ANTHONY RIZZI-In the fl

Los Angeles area and RIZZI's contacts with the GADLOS at New

York and PISCOPO's statements of recent times that he has received

orders not to have anything further to do with RIZZI would tend

to indicate that PISCOPO probably is a member of/the PROFACI

group and he is possibly referring to SALVATORE PROFACI when he

speaks of a new boss.

The Los Angeles Division 1s presently effecting a

confidential source in connection with PISCOPO in its efforts to

further penetrate into the Italian underworld and the set up of

the various families.

There is no information avallable at this time that

of these matters. The person best suited for this role seems

to be that previously reported NICOLO LICATA upon whom an inten-

sifled investigation 1s underway.

Other persons who are possibly vy

involved in such operations are JOHNROSSELLI also the subject

of an intensified investigation.

No charts are being prepared as there is not sufficient

Information available to accurately portray a family set up in
