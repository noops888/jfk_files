“Unidentified Man"

Photographs of the unidentified man were taken ty
our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963. going
into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in

Mexico City.

‘Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas,
Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have
appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691. of
the Warren Commission Report, and the book “Appointment in
Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beeni
identified.

2, On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) récognized photographs of
the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer. whom he met
in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course
there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish
speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for. the Cuban group

about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with

-~2-
the Cuban and-Bulgarian groups quartered in the same building

in Moscow, Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve
it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB
officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the

West German intelligence apparatus, Juan told the DGI member
that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.
clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri
was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes
with the Cuban group.

3, SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an
individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description
of the unidentified man, This lead to an individual by the
name of. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor
of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international
scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier,
Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a
sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many
of the documents in his dossier are OO reports from U.S.
scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at
scientific meetings, It is obvious that he has a much greater
knowledge of the English language than he admits, His capability
is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is
noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.
It is also noted that on occasions he reportedly was not
qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference,

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

Following are items of interest from selected documents in
MOSKALEV's CRS dossier

c. In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to the
IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island
New York. Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV
was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made
a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to
radiation ‘lethality.

International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West

did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious
notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was
going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.
From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he “new
