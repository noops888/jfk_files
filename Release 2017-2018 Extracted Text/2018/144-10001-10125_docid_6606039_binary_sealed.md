The Inconcelvable and irexplicable impunity with which en

Individual of known penal antecedente assassinated OSWALD, tha

principal accused of the assassination of President KENNEDY, in

the presence of the police thenselves and in the sal or a

prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manet

that the powerful reactionary political forces within the

United States are making use of all cheir resources and tafluences

in order to conceul those who master-hinded KENNEDY's assassloation

and the true notives for it.

World public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds

It is absurd that the political authorittes and the probecueles

attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when

hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result as

the assagsination of the President of the United States:
