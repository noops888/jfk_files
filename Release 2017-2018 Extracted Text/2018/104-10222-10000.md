The high morale in his Division comes from the widespread

position he distinguished himself. He was brought in to take over

the Wil Division when the Chief of that Division became the DD/ P.

That in itsell'was an eloquent admission of the esteem in which his

capabilities are held. His performance in the WH Division has fully

lived up to thia evaluation. He took over the Division lust after the

Agency had become immersed in the

crisis. At

the same time, i dozen other problems of one kind or another required

the most serious attention. He has made several field trips to his

I wish to commend and make a matter of record the

outstanding support and guidance rendered to this organi

zation by Mr. Wi1liam V. Broe, Special Assistant to

Ambassador,

from the period of July 1903

2.

Nr. Broe's efforts in support of this organization

were exemplary.

He gave freely of himself and of the re

sources at his disposal. In those instances where we

were contemplating a new approach to obtaining aerospace.

data of priority national interest Mr. Broe provided for

briefings by his specialists in the denied areas under

consideration. His every approach was intended to intel

ligently present the information available concerning the

difficulties to be encountered and rewards to be expected.

He always left the United

States Air Force personnel con-

cerned

secure in the knowledge

that he fully

supported

any promising attempt to acquire data of national interest

and

that ne did all

in his pover to expedite the acquisi

tion of these data.

This resulted in a most favorable

operating milieu.

In all of our dealings' with Mr. Broe, we found him to

be friendly, highly objective,

unswerring in his demands

for professionalism,

and a person

of honor and integrity.

He liked, trusted and respected him.

Mr. Broe's demon-

strated professionalism and ability to advise,

stimulate

and coordinate the

efforts of the many diverse elementa
