Subject is so well qualified to meet the requirements of Napisy ghie? of a large
area division that there may well be a tendency to lose sight of his Mbuity to run an
organization of his own, This capability was amply demonstrated when he was chief
of the China Branch of FE Division.

Subject 4s unusually strong ad a supervisor, His flair for warm but impartial
relationships with subordinates-hus enabled him to develop a first-hand understanding
of the capabilities, shortcomings and problems of a very large proportion of all FE
personnel. His direction-of personnel does not lack firmness but is expressed in such
a way that feelings are considered and best results are achieved,

Subject's operational judgment is entirely reliable. He has an encyclopedic know-
ledge and understanding of the Division's operations and a full grasp of political i
implications throughout the area,

I have noted no weaknesses in Subject, which would inhibit his successful

assumption of increasing responsibilities.

outstanding support and guidance rendered to this organi-

zation by Mr. William V. Broe, Special Assistant to the
Ambassador, from the period-of July 1963 to
: idate. :

2. Mr. Broe's efforts in support of this organization
were exemplary. He gave freely of himself and of the re-
sources at his disposal. In those instances where we
were contemplating a new approach to obtaining aerospace.
data of priority national interest Mr, Broe provided for
briefings by his specialists in the denied areas under
"consideration. His every approach was intended to intel-
digently present the information available concerning the
difficulties to be encountered and rewerds to be expected.
He always left the United States Air Force personnel con-
cerned secure in the knowledge that he fully supported
any promising attempt, lo acquire d. P national interest
and that he all in hic power to expedite the acquisi-
tion of these data. This resulted in a most favorable
operating milieu. oe

3. In all of our dealings’with Mr. Broe, we found him to
be friendly, highly objective, unswerving in his demands :
for professionalism, and a person of honor and integrity. eee
We liked, trusted and respected him. Mr. Broe's demon-

strated professionalism and ability to advise, stimulate

and coordinate the efforts of the many diverse elements

engaged in collection.of information reflected favorably

upon him and-the Intelligence Community of the United

States.
