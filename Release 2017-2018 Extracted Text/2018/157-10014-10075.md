He took over as Daputy Director of Plans ln the Winter u

14

1962 and remalued in that position essentially until he bocine

15

the haad of the Agency in 1956.

16

The flrst thing that I think that we should cover with

17

him is to go through his porspoctiva on what was happaning

with respact to cuba generally without getting to the assassir.

option but he la vory luesy when you get down to was it

actually discussed.

Mr. Smothers. What in very halpful, l think, and we spent

nome time with him yesterday, on simply going through his

Impressions of how Mongoose developed and how he had come to

the fouling that. he articulated very clearly that there was no

doubt in his mind about what his marching ordura were about

what they wanted done, they being the President on down.

Wa talked ahout the quastion of the various sources of thir

kind of impression, mootings he had with cablnet noople, meatles

that Mr. McCone would have, his conversarlons with Mccone.

While not explicit, it in vary clear that all of these moorin'i

appear to him to be consistent.

I think the other thing that may be very halilul for un

to try to got a close 100% at is the nature of the coordinarls..

again as refluctad by Mongoose.

Here we have a pulling tore her

of ossentially all of the government aroncios in an affort to

Attorroy Goneral's Involvement, it appsars as he sold vesterday

Inaight on the authority then.

I think I also found Interesting yestorday his atticude

toward the Malla people. lla clearly talke about then as jus:

another asset, but his attitude - and correct me lt I'm uron:

hare - was more or leas to pooh-pooh it. Here was sonething.

It was wild-ayad, it probably will never work, but lt's somether

we'll throw agalnst the wall. Mid I think loft us with the

Impression, okay, lot him go out and try It. but, you know.

nobody rually axpects anything to come of this, and he la

particularly pooh-poohed when he talks about what was expecte

Mr. Millar. I think the attitude that, number one, he

stated, I mean thia la the statement, that he 1a going to

respond to any quastion by the Committee fully. That was his

Intantion declared.

Secondly I think that he feels that trenty-flve yoars, his

down there, at which time . thia van before Castro took over

but at which time ho was Identifled specifically as a

communint and there was a very real feeling in the fleenhorer

raministration that having a Communist regime 20 miles fron cha

whores of the United States was a most unwelcone development.

These thoughta led to the project which over time has

come to be known under the rubric of the Bay of Pigo. It was

certainly not known as that when 1t began and lt was begun as

projoct to orjanize Cuban exilus, Cubans who had bean exilet

by Castro from Cuba or had flod of their own volition, Into a

brigade tralned in guerrilla tactica, the objective baina to

land in cuba in the hope that with this show of force, those

Cubans still there who were anainst Castro word rise up and

Implicit in this scheme was that lf the Invasion

force got fror

any sardous trouble, or conversely if ther had a no0i chance

of making it, they

could probably rely on American military

support or Anarican support of some kind.

In any avant, you all know the history of the nay of plas.

In tho CIA, wa vare informed that caneral Lanadale, who

an office in the Department of Defense which was dodicatel to

But In other words, It was the point at which the cIn in

Lansdalo was going to ornanize a whole organization underneath

Mr. Halms. I think I can't point to somebody else whose

perceptions might be more accurate than mine. I don't think

that one would have approached the AMLASIl thing as an

assassination plot against Castro. I think that one would havo

approached that as an extension of our efforte to set up some

kind of opposition group to Castro inaide Cuba of which Cubola

was. I queas, our prime opportunity, and that the pressures,

an I recall it. for guns and things of that kind all came from

Cubela himsell, thay didn't come from the Agency, This maon'e

somothing we wore trying to sot up.

Thia was somothing Cubelo

was trying to sot up. Ile hatod Castro and wantod to got rid

of him.

MI. Schwarz. The Ayency facilitated that by helping

him got guns: is that right?

MI. Holms. I think the number of people we tried to

givo guns to in the history of these Cuban operations was

multitudinous.

Mr. Schwarz. But you did give gun's to Mr. MLASH Or --

MI. Helms. If the record

Mr. Schwarz. And you just don't remember whathor that

Mr. Holms. At the tlmo this review was made, Senator

Goldwater, and I think that it appears in the back of de

many yeara later. I am not saying I remembor all of these

things just cold as that. But from roading this and trying

to remembar concrete tho circumatances of the time, thore was

an effort made to figure out who might have done this, and

I think it may well be that this is one of the reasons I have

got these names up in the top of those handwritton notes of

mine - 1t might have been the lawyer, Ed Morgan, it might

be Roselll, It might be Mahou, or Garrison, who was out in

Los Vogas,. with Mahou and some of the others. In other wordi.

I think that is what this noto could very concedvably, the toy

for the purpose of assassinating Castro, and pilla were

supplled and guns wore supplied for that purpose. The fact

that they falled to do it or may not have carried through in

quito a different question.

Mr. llelms. I undorstand.

Mr. Schwars. Lot's look at the other item under

unpuliahod dotalla. The item 1a quotes There was a meting

at tho Dapartmont of State at which the asassination of

Castro was discussed" the conclusdon of your Inspector

meoting at State on 10 August 1962, but it 1a unrolated to sny

Lansdale momo that we have discused previously.

But do you agrce with their statement of true and chat

It was unrelated, or not?

MI. Helms. I just don't know anymore. But there is no

reason for me to question the documents, and 18 tho documones

indicate that this was the case, I am prepared to accept 1e.

I think I ought to make a distinction botween what !

have no reason to fight the question.

Mr. Schwarz. As of that timo, August '62, Mr. Harvoy

it was not a vory long continued active and I use the word

Do I understand from the tenor of these remarke that

IRRIFLE coally wasn't a big thing in the agency, in your

Mr. Holma. No.

An a matter of fact, it was a tiny little thing and I

noticod, Sonator Baker, in one of the pagos here that Mr. Har-

vey said that he got this involved in his mind with some of tha

things ho was trying to do on Cuba.. I havo no recollaction ol

what I think undoubtedly was involvod?

in the clandestine services we had a very careful

bookkeeping system that all monies had to be allocated again

Senators will remember,. that when the Agency was set up under

the National Security Act of 1947, and then later Central

Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, thore were authoritios given

to the Director of Central Intelligenco for uso of unvouchered

¿unda and certification to tho une of those funds had to come

from the Diroctor by law. And so every Director as far as l knon.

doscilbed, to pay people under your

people or was it done by cash as a rule, or how did that

voucher follow-up occur

undor physical control?

Mr. Helms. We did 1t variously. Sometimos actual

cash was passed to a sensitivo agent.

For examplo, you might pay him in Indian rupoes, then els

man who passed the monoy would sign in the office a certifi-

cation under the cryptonym of this operation saying on such and

such a day he passed X Indian rupeos to agunt so-and-so.

Now, do you assumo from that, that being the general

Mr. Helma. Yes.

The Chairman.. Not, it is quite hard for me to under-

#tand how you go back and check

constantly with the Special

apparently no such communication with the special Group on an

assassination plan against cho Cuban loador.

Can you axplain that?

when you engaged cloments of tho Malla to porform and operation

for the CIA, that if it had worked out as hoped would have

resulted in the assassination of Caatro, then you toll us

that you didn't bring it to the attention of Mr. MeCono

because you didn't think that it was that important, and

that he had any

particular nood to know about 1t.

That strikes me as being very atrange. I should think

that if there was one thing that the Diroctor of the CIA

Well, It's an interesting point you make,

bocause theoratically this would not be tho case, but there

was d situation in which he got himsolf very much on the othor

I havo liatened to the testimony from this morning and

this of this aftarnoon and in all faliness l cannot agree that

that 1s what the witness said this morning. He has repeatedly

this altarnoon disavowed any personal knovledge of what the

purpose, or that thare were any pilla dellvared, or to whom.

And I think that among us attorneys the best avidance of what is

on the record is the document itsell.

If ho has no personal knowladge, I don't thisk we should

subject tho Ambassador to trying to authanticate a document

we put him in a position that is untonable in this rejaid.

May 14, 1962 and purports to bo a mamorandum for the record

Mr. Holma. I am not at all lamiliar any longar wich what

causes this confusion, I hope that Mr. Harvey can straighten

it out when you talk to him, but I am not able to tall you

whather this operation was ongoing, whother it had really been

stopped, whether it had been falrly stopped, whother there was

fun and games going on between the officars involved as to, we

w1l1 create a fiction that it stopped or go ahead with it.

I just don't recall any of those thinga at all, I am sorry to

say, and I think anything I say would be unhelpful.

HI. Schwarz. All right.

At any point aftar you became Daputy Director of Plans

and up to the point that you left that job to assume your

highar job, did you instruct the Agency to in effect stand down

from ongoing afforts to assassinate Mi. Castro?

Mi. Helmg. I don't recall whether there was any time at

which anything specific like that was sald.. As the oparation

I was toduced in intensity and reduced in scopo, my recollaction is

that we were continuing with a certain few oparations of which

this gangater business was not one of them. I realized that

Harvey was in touch with Roselll for some time, but I do not

have any impression any longer that after the first few months

there was any roal substance to this.

As a matter of fact, I have toothis day wondared if there's

any

substance to it from the very beginning.

Mr. Sewharz. Well, let's leave out the Mafia question.

Cubans to do the things they sald they ware going to do.

kinds, I think there wore efforts made to provide lay down

caches in Cuba. This

1s an ongoing prooccupation of providing

caches of arms and explosives and so forth to various groups

that we though might have some possibility of mounting an

In other words. I'do not recall that we would have thought

that he was reporting to Castro on his connections with U.s.

agents in Paris.

of the files and telegrams and so forth at the time, but 1t

means to me that what Cubela subsequently admitted to when he

vas try vas the latter phass of the operation. I don'e know

that he really went back to the beginning of the operation and

covered all of thess things. So that thia particular contact

might not necessarily have bean in his confession, I balleve.

Now 18 I'm wrong, would ond of you strainhten me out?

Mr. Schwarz, Nell, I think one thing is worth saying.

•According to the reports that the CIA got, Mr. Cubele

confused to an effort to assassinate Castro, but according to

the reports thoy got, ho did

not confees to the involvement o!

tha Central Intelligence Agency.

Senator Morgan. Mr. Chairman, one point I was trying to

make for future reference was that if ho was in fact double

agant, then we did lead Castro to bellave that lt was a plot.

that the kennedys knew of 'it, whether thoy did of not. That is

the point I wanted for the record.

Senator Baker. I think you might also, for future retarence.

point out that according to nowspaper accountis, at least, Castro

claims to have known and claims to be in a position to supply

us information

about it.

Now, did you know about that?

Mr. Helms, I can't ranambar. I have trled, and the reason

say this, that I cannot remember, is that when I saw it in the

report, I thought, that's odd, I don't recall any such thing.

So I'm sorry, I Just cannot be halpful about it.

The only thing that I did check up on was that he never

took the pen. I've done this within the last forty-eight hours.

The record was not particularly clear on thia, le didn't seem

to me, and I thought, well, this is a key point and I happened

to rodlizo there was somebody in Washington whom I thought misht.

Mr. Schwarz. Who was that person?

Mr. Helms. A man named Samuel Halperin.

Mr. Schwarz. I was planning to move on to Lumumba, unloss --

are there more matters on Mi. Castro?

Sanator Mathlas. I think Senator Morgan might have gotten

Sanator Morgan. That'e right. It's logical the man would

have done a little boasting.

Senator Schwalker, I have one question on Castro.

Mr. Helms, 1f in fact Castro did know of these plots, and

It's hard for ma to understand that he did not, given all the

facts that we have seen, might this not have procipitatad a

climate hounded by the Bay of Pige that really fostered the

Cuban missile crisis that made Castro go out looking for ways

to got aven with us?

Is not that a real possibility, that 1!

In fact we did know of our attempts to kill him?

MI. Helma. Yes, but -- I had alwaya understood that the

Cuban missile crisis was something that was generated by the

1'3. Soviats and their dasires and that they approached castro to

do this. Maybe his willingness to go along might have been

2:

22

alfected by it, but there cannot be the slightest doubt that

Castro, When ha came to power, must have been keenly avare that

23

the imerican government was very antipathetic to him in every

24

concalvable way.

Cubola was the type of person that whon Flezgerald --

I think you'll find if you get all of the telegrans, you'll

find

that there was an anormous amount of temporizing with thin

tallow to keep him on the toan, to koop him working away at the

Job, but to try and parsuade him that this was not the way to

go about it.

And the shall, this was a cock-ayed idea from the outsot.

Thia was the highly Intensive imagination of a fellow who

thought, well why wouldn't this be a great idea, but a totally

impractical thing. I mean, I cannot call that a plot.

Senator Bakei. Dut there are others, let's not call it a

plot, call it playing with fire, ll you want to, but it's sore

of a dangarous thing to do evan, just to contemplate with any

official sanction of an organization, killing someone aise.

It doesn't make any diffarance really how far 1t went.

The point I'm trying to maka ls, lt seems to me a long jump

from nine plans to kill Fidol Castro by assassination to saying

that we gave the poison pon to a fellow not to kill him, but it

to placate him.

MI. Helms. Wall, naybe I read these words wrong, and maybe

my recollection at the time is imperfect. But I thought that

this operation was really designed to not only get information

i: through Major Cubala, but to try and organize a political

Mr. Holma, My recollection of what they wore direct

formation doveloped on domestic affairs in the United States

on not only dissidents but penetrations of foreign intelli-

gence services and activitios of foreign intelligence ner-

vices, and no forth. I don't say that other thinge aren't

covorod in the report but my recollection

of what the whole

puspose of the exerciao was to try to improve covorago in the

domestic fleld.

Mr. Schwarz. And in that connoction to toll the Prest-

dent whether there were certain rostrictions on the ability

of the intelligence agencies to oporate chat might bo lifeed:

1s that right?

Mr. Helms. Yes, it strikes me that what he had asked

for originally was for a wide-ranging report on all of the

things that got in the way of improving this domestic

coverage from the FBI and NSA and

so forth so he could consi-

der what these various obstacles were or were considered to

be, such as laws and traditions and things of that kind.

Mr. Schwarz. One of the techniques which the Committee,

including yourself focussed on, was the one callod mall

coverage: is that right?

MI, Iclms, I assume so. Yes, we have a heading hore

Mr. Helma. You see, what I don't know hore, sir, 1

wouldn't knowingly have signed something that I didn't

bolleve to be true, and I don't know whether this was referring

to covert coverage by the FBI or somebody else. At least the

agency was going to be at that time with this same small

operation in New York that had been going for some 20

years, but I can't imagine that it was referring to that

because otherwise I would be aigning something that wasn't

true, and I would have no reason for doing it. I could haave

it stuck out so I can only assume in the context of working

level meetings which produced this report this must apply to

something the FBI had been doing or planning to do.

Mr. Schward.

How would President Nixon know that.

As far as he was concerned he was reading a document that

says flatly covert coverage has been discontinued and he

kind of got in a lot of trouble on this, you remomber the re-

lease of the lluston Plan, and that it went on and President.

Mr. Helmo, No, excapt-what I belleve could be the case,

that we are talking about an fBI effort here.

Mr. Smothera, Can you think of anything to be gained

by CIA or any other Agency putting in thia report the fact

that coverage had been discontinued?

Mr-llelms. Mbaolutely nothing, and you know this CIA

operation in any event was on a very narrow focus. I belleve

in this connection a thought here was to have a great deal

more coverage involving

other parts of the world. CIA

that you might find some of the individuals who were on the

Mr. Schwarz, Isn't this tho kind of thing chat a

Mitchell was unhappy with it and prevailed on the President

with the Army or Defense Department rather than the CIA in

Senator Baker.

I do know that Senator Ervin was

deeply involved in the invasion of privacy military spying

situation. That was the one I holleve that got so much

publicity and related back to the lugton plan.

Mr. Schwarz. I wonder if the sentence that Senator

Baker focussed on which

is the second sentence at the top,

CIA and military investigative agencies have found this

information particularly holpful in the past.

Doesn't that connote to a reader that both for the

CIA and the military it la a past matter?

about the extent of his knowledge on this. Maybe we ought

I didn't -- what I am trying to say in that I am trying vosy

hard at thia late date to place Mr. Lumumba in his propar

political nicho: I an relativaly certain that he represented

something that the United States Governmant didn't like but

I can't romember any more what it was.

Has he a rightist or leftine?

Senator Schwelker. Whatever it was ho was marked for

assasination.

Senator Mathias. The curlous thing I remembor, drawing

purely on personal recollection, we actually had him come to

Washington as a guest of the U.S. Governmant and he stayed

at Blair House and was wined and dined as our greatest friend

ac, one point, shortly after his accession to power.

Senator last of Michigan. I think Fidel Castro came

after he came to power. That was the only time congress

took an early fall recess because they didn't want to stay

around here and have to have a joint session. They quit

for the year.

Senator Baker. Whep are we getting back?

• Mr. Schwarz. Do you know a man named Justin O'Donnell?

MI. Helms. Yes, sir.

MI. Schwarz. A CIA agent?

Mr. Helms. He used to be an officor in the CIA, yos, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Were you awaro that there was a plan to

assassinate Mr. Lumumba?

Mr. Helms. Not at the time. I have obviously learned

about these thinga subsequently because & obvlously read that

report that was mado in 1967 at the timo so I was conscious

later on that therewas, but I have no contemporaneous

recollection of this business about Lumunha.

Mr. Smothers. Were you at all involved in that?

Mr. Helms. I don't recall having been and i think i

might vory well have but I juat don't recall thia business

about Lumumba.

Actually what was wrong with Lumumbo, why didn'e we

like him?

Senator Schwelker. That de the tragedy of the whole

thing. Nobody knows why we wanted to got rid of somebody.

Mr. Smothers.

MI. Helma. No, I don't.

As a matter of fact, interestingly enough, when was

Malcolm X alive? He died but when was it?

In any event, it is not important about the dates but

I remember that in a particular era when he was aldve à loc

of hig followers were very much opposed to the CIA and

were making statements about it and so forth, the

allegations being widespread in that part of the black

Mi. Schwarz. Mr. Biasell has tostifled that there was

at least a plan to assasainate Lumumba. Did you chock with

him whan you made that check?

Mr, llelma. No, he left the

agency by that time.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. O'Donnell testifled that he was asked

by Mr. Bissell-to actually assassinate MI. Lumumba and upon

hearing that request he went to see a man called robilleb. i

Do you know Mr. Gottlieb?

Mr. Helms. ISidney Gottliab?

Yes.

Mr. Schwarz.

And was shown some poisons and deadly

Viruses, and then he came to your office and he

stated to you that Mr. Bissell had asked him to kill Lumumba

but that he wasn't going to do it, and you said you agreed

he shouldn't do it?

Mr. Helms. I don't remember the conversation at all

but I don't have any reason to cavil with it. I don't recall

the conversation.

Mr. Schwarz. You can't add anything on that?

Mr. Helms. No.

in 1967. Why did you have that report

prepared, incidentally:

since the Drew Pearson column had been limited to Castro?

MI. Schwars. Do you recall his maying anything spo-

cifically about Trujillo, why Trujillo was included?

MI. Hoims, I think he was just trying to check on

various reports that he had heard about how these people had

come to die. You know there wore assartions around that,

and I have forgotten any more whether they were newspaper

assertions of just things sort of mentioned by the back of the

hand, but he wanted to know whother the Agency had been respon-

»ible for those deaths and that was why l asked to have this

work done.

ME. Schwarz. All right, now, on Diem. I think you told

us yesterday afternoon that he, President Johnson, had a

particular theory about the death of Mr. Diem.

Would you recount that for the committee?

MI. Helme. He once said to me that he just wondered

whether President Kennedy hadn't died because he had caused

the death of President Diem of Vietnam, and I remembor him

having said this to me because it struck me hard at the

time. I thought this was a pecullar conception, but that is

all I know about it and the conversation never went any

further.

Mr. Schwarz. You had the report done on Trujillo and

you reported back to Prenident Johnson about all three matters,

Castro, Trujillo and Diem?

Mr. Helms, Yes, sir.

Ms. Schwarz. When you reported on Trujillo, based upon

had anything to do with the death of Mr. Truj11lo?

Mr. Halma. I gave him the controversy an I recald it chae

pointad in the direction of the Agency not being responsible

for his death.

work with South Vietnam was thero any link that comes to your

mind as to why Preaident jonson might havo said that?

MI. Helms. No, that was what struck me, Sonator

Schweiker. I probablywouldn't have remembered somothing

like this if it hadn't seced to be an odd bellet to have.

after President Kennedy's assassination and that it

Mr. Helms. Not long ago, Senator Schralker, I forget,

I guess 1t must have been on one of my trips back here, I

don't remember which one, but I was watching a news report

one night and it seemed to me that Walter Kronkite had

some kind of a clip in the news report.

Sonator Schweiker.

Of an intorview?

Me. llelms. An interview with President Johnson in which

thig was generally advertod to. I don't remember the

exact words, But President Johnson aort of ended up saying you

know I am not entirely sure or somothing and sort of tralled

off.

MI. Schwarz. Was that the occasion on. which President

Johnson sald wa had at some points been running a burder, Inc.

in the Caribbean?

MI. Helms. No, that language wasn't used. This was an

interview after he ceased to be President. It was part of

the long series Kronkite made at the ranch sometime after he

left office.

Senator Mathias. Was this statoment by President Johnson

sort of amoral, was he drawing a moral conclusion?

Mr. Helms, It saemed to me to have a heavy overtono o!

that.

Senator Mathias, Rather than a factual historical

deduction?

MI. Helms. Yes, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you have anything to do with the

passage of weapons from the United States to dissidents in

the Dominican Republie?

this was handled largely by MI. Biasell and the Chief of

the westorn lemisphere Division at that time, Colonal King, ind

In other words, this authorizing some document or other.

The question has come up. about whether or not weapons were

passed in the pouch, the official pouch to the Dominican

Republic, and I was suggesting, as you remember yesterday

alternoon, I don't know whather those records exist any more,

but I was really serioualy. wondering whethar the actual

State Dapartmant pouch had ever been used for such a purpose

because I had put a watch dog on the pouch for the simple

reason that we were using State Department facilities, that

they had certain regulations about the kind of things that

should go in the pouch, and I wanted to be cortain that year-in

and your-out there were not abuses of the pouch priviloge

because of the terrible temptation on the lowest lovel for

employees to want to send

perfume and other

customs lteng

through the pouch to avoid paying dutdes and so forth, and

that also there are all kinda of abuses that one can make

over a pouch that can't be opened by foreigners or domestios.

So, I had the widow of a foreign service officer

periodically on this job to be sure there weren'e violations

of the pouch, and if it should come

to

there should be

record whether anybody made an excoption, whether

I or any*

body else in the Agency for sending guns through the pouch,

there should be something there to indicate that exception

was

made.

In other words, this is not something that somebody

could do Just by saying send thia package in the pouch.

Mr. Schwarz. The record shows some weapons were sent

through the pouch, the record being the report made to you

1n '67.

Dut I asked you, I think, whether you know in

1960 or 1961 that the U.S. Government had supplied weapons

to dissidents in the Domincan Republic.

Mr. Helma.

I am sorry, Mr Schwarz, I don't remember.

I mean I could have known. I don't think I knew. I don't think

I was involved in that part of the oporation. But, on the

other hand, with all of the thinga that havo gone on :

through

th cycars it could have been that I have been cold about this.

Mr. Schwaiz. Then I take it also follows you can't

add anything as to whether of not the Agency had autholty to

supply guns at all, number one; had suchority to supply

guns for the purpose of assasgination, number two?

MI. Helms. I thought that when I was reading this I.G.

report that there was a voluminous amount of telegraphic

correspondence and memoranda and so forth about every move

in this whole thing being cleared with the State Department

and so forth.

Are these things not covered in that record?

Mr. Schwarz. There was a great deal of discussion of

clearance with the State

Departnent, Indeed, there is a man

called Deerborn who is in the State Dopartment who appears

to be a motivating force.

MI. Helma, Yes, alI. These exotic phrases are

ouphemiams that are used to doscribe these purposes, none

of them were indulged in with my parmission and I don't

believe they were indulged in at all. I just simply did

not belleve in this method of taking care of one's embarrass-

ments, if you want to call it that, and I never authorized

any cuch actions at any time.

As I explained this morning, 1t la not only the moral

question involved but in our form of country and with our

philosophy and, if you like, theology, it aimply lan'e an

acceptable way to do business and, therefore, other methods

have to be found.

I know in the ditcrature of espionage and secret wars and

so forth, particularly Boltish, French, German, Russlan, and

so forth, there are references to the fact when an agent,

secret agent becomes an embarrassment he was eliminated, he

was gotten rid of. But i just don't belleve that this was a

viable system, either morally or any other way, for us to

conduct purselves with people who had gone sour and we just

tried to find other methods of taking care of the problem.

Senator Schweiker. In

the carlier daya, before your

tenure as Director, was this always our policy, or maybe

carlier in the cra of the CIA this was not as flrmly estab

lished or left to local option.

Mr. Schwarz.

Now, you also have said that, focussing

on the Castro operation, there the pressure to get rid of Castro

of to overthrow the Castro government constituted an author-

Ization, at least an implicit authorization to kill him, to

assassinate him.

Now when you became Director, so that

general instruction to overthrow his government, and recog-

nizing further that it to your attitude or it la your testimony

that you thought that was unacceptable for both practical

and moral reasons, did you take any stepa to lasue an instruc-

tion to prevent such activity from occurring again?

made it clear to my senior

associates when I was Director.

I simply didn't want this to go on, and I think if you will

you by saying that obvioualy I have given thought to these

matters. I have wondered what it was that if it had happened

differently through the years might have avoided these various

things.

I have looked at the law, the atatute, I think there

are things that should be changed in it and & think it should

be tightoned up in certain respects, but i am also mindíul of

the fact that as long as one is dealing with himan beingo.

wIltten words are not going to be the dotermining factor in

their conduct 24 hours a day seven days of the week, and that

I would hope that in the future what 1s called oversight over

intelligence activities been given a fuller opportunity,.

hecause I honestly believe that part of the problem through

the years has been that those people who had oversight over

intelligence activities, or particularly the accivities of the

CIA, were senior officials both in the Executive and in Congres

who were so bugy and so preoccuplied about other matters that

rather short shrift has been given to this activity, and if

there are better oversight or better opporcunitles to have

extended conversations with menbers of the Congreas, for

example, I think some of these things could be headed off

simply by an indication

from a hairman of a committee or

something that this didn't seem to be desirable, or from sui

other senators.

For example, let me just take a specific Inatance.

The Senate Foreign Relationa Committee, when I was leaving,

had a hearing about

something having to do with police

departments. It was the sense of the committee that this was

an undeairable actlvity for the Agency

to be helping police

departmenta diractly, so they made a statement to the effect

this should stop. So I believe it was stopped that very day.

There don't any desire of these people to yo beyond what they

have been told not to do, But if you can't got ahold of your

oversight committee or choy don't have meetings and you aro

busy you go

ahead doing as best you can, and I honestly

believe, you know, as I look back in history that Mr. Dulles

would have been very pleased if he would have had a couple

of Senators by the hand when he went into the Bay of Pigs.

Senator Schwelker. I think you are perfectly right about

oversight. I couldn't agree with you more. And I think here

congress itself has been derellot. I agree with that. I

think that is a very serious weakness of Congress on the over-

sight committees. The other

aspect I think is important, too.

and I concede the first point is in many cases when some

oversight was tried to be exercised, and let me say very litt:!

was. I don't think the intelligence agencies leveled with thr

Congress per se, too, and I think that that is a very serioun

problem from those who want to say choy want to do a good jon

when you don't have that leveliny or credibility or whatever

you want to call it, how do ve instill that in a system?

Mt. Helms, I thought that the Agency's record of lovel-

ing was pretty good when given the opportunity.

Senator Schweiker, I don't recall ever being before one

of the oversight committoos set up by Congress and not

absolutely honestly and fairly answering any question I was

asked.

senator Schwelker. Now, how about the war in Laos? i

sat on the House and Senate Armed Sarvices Committees, Mr.

Ambassador, and I think I was on there for eight years, all

during the war, before CIA owned up to conducting a war in

Laos. And I think stu Symington, who sat on the Select or on

the Committee on Superviaion of CIA made the discovery.

I can't agree with you on laos because I sat on the

llouse and Senate Armed Service Committees when you folks camu

a number of times and testified and we had to stumblo into

it backwards. I think senator Symingion really did it thraugh

Foreign Relations contacts, even

though he was on thr oversight

Committee of the Armed Services. I think there is a case where

I won't agree with you, even though I agree with what you said

about oversight.

MI. Helms. I am under oath. Would you mind if I ducked

this?

I can give you no answer except to tell the truth and

I would rather not set into it now, if you don't mind, unless

it is important to you.

In other words, did the Agency In

Mr. Helma. I don't know of any conversations about this.

Senator Mathias. Ambassador, You, I think explained

very fully and lucidly the way in which you felt you had

authority to act in the very situations , which was a kind ot

a blanket authority without restriction, and that once this

was determined, as Illustrated by the case of Attornuy

Senator Mathias.

There was an exchange of, if not words,

an axchange of ideas and feelings that kept the situation

curront and continually kept you reassured that there was no

lack, there had been no change of direction at the highest

lovels?

MI, llelms. Yes alr.

Senator Mathias. That was truo as far as the Castro

situation was concerned?

In other situations was there an oxchange of ideas in

this same level of intensity?

MI. llelms. I don't recall except on Vietnam as many

regular exchanges on any subject as there were on Cuba.. And

to get the attention of the top members of the Government on

a continuing basis on one theme really takes a great deal of

attention to that theme on the part of the White House in

order to generate the fact that the Secretary of State should

attend that meeting rather than that meeting on a specifie dry.

The power of the President flows into these matters

in a strang

way and if the Secretary of State appears at an inter-Govorn-

mental meeting it is because he is pretty clear in his mind

that is where he ought to be that day rather than making

Sanator Mathias. How did you manage then undor these

difficult circumstances -- I understand exactly what you are

saying = manago to bo. sure that, say, in the Lumumba situation.

oI Trujillo situation that there was this same kind of cor

tinuing policy, or there hadn't been any change in polley?

Mr. Holms. I don't know the Lumumbs altuation, I don't

know whore the idea came from or what the poldey was any longer

at all, and the trujillo situation I think that the record

shows an on-going back and forthing between the Agency and

the State

Department about the sicuation in the dominican

Republic.

lere it soems to me we had a situation In which it

stayed in CIA rather than inter-agency committed formally

established dealing with this matter, I know in there, for

example, Assistant Secretary Rubottom's name keeps coming

up again and again so I assume the Agency people ware dealing

on a continuing basis.

Senator Mathias. Now, after November 22, 1963, when

President Johnson came in, I think your cestimony is that you

continued to deal with Attorney General Kennedy?

Mr, Helms. I think for a time we did as long as he was

Attorney General. I foryet how long he stayed there. But !

him up to that time. This de just something that occurred to

me at chis moment but I do recall asking him that question.

Senator Machias, And you continued to deal on these

matters with him although he didn't atand in quite the same

relationship with President Johnson as he obviously had to

Preaident Kennedy?

• Mr. Helms. I think on the matter of the Castro business.

it would have been with that Special Group rather than him

parcicularly, because by this time that thing had wound down

somewhat. But I think that he was atill Involved. I think

that 1a right.

Senator Mathias. So there is a kind of fluidity about

the whole relationship in all of these matters that is very

difficult to

MI. Helms. Would it be helpful to you if I were to say

over this period of 25 years it has been a very fluid thing,

this busoness of getting clearances and approvals and how

close you are piped in and how close you are not piped in and

overgight and all of these things do change through the years.

It is one of the

reasons I think that the establishment of thi

Select Committee 25 years later to look at the intelligence

community is a very baluable, wize thing for our country. I

think a lot of things have

to be brought up to date, I chini:

the experiances of 25 years ought to be used to tighten this.

so-called has kind of grown like Topsy over the years. Here

was an agency and there was another agency and then you add a

third and then you add a fourth and then tou find some way to

relate them and find some way to try and coordinate them and

find some way to get Congressional oversight of them and if you

wore to start from absolute scratch and one day say let'a set

up an intelligence community you might sot the thing up

entirely differently and maybe more effoctively. So the 25

years later I think it is juat fine that this Committe has

seized thia problem. It is very difficult one and I don't

believe by circling you are yoing to find many casy answers

but it is certainly an effort worth making on behalf of our

country. After all, two things. Intelliyence is the first

Senator Mathias. I think that in a very helpful and

useful comment.

I think we understand that by whatever means, by whatever

form of human communication was involved that original

authorizations were given even at various times

for given

projects. The projecte may have altored. I think thụ

testimony, not only your costimony but Mr. Diasall's and othera

has boen that a project undertaken to remove somebody in a

political sense might become later a project to remove that

same person in a physical sense. So the projects did alter.

But, all pursuant to the original authorization, do you

think that there was adequate political control as this kind

of undulation took place, that a Prosident or a President's

designee, for example, aufficiently aware of the undulations

and had an opportunity to veto the action at some point, at

sone critical point?

MI. Helms. I think that the basic thruat of what you ar

saying is quite accurate. As a long time, I might put it this

way, bureaucrat, it seems to me one of the great problems of

Government is that one starts sonething it takos on a life of

its own, then le gets turned off far too late, and I have bore

clear purpose and shining light and so forth, so I insued

those instructions and I am relatively cortain they were com-

plied with through the years.

Senator Schwalker. Can you shed any light -- I think our

Peace Corps people were thrown out of Caylon with the allegation

that thoy were helping the CIA?

Mr. Helme This was a KGD political or psychological war-

fare rather. At that time for years, even very shortly after

the Peace Corps began, that the soviet propaganda kept

asscrting that it was CiA that was under the Peace Corps, iº

was CIA, that was in the Arab press and Asiatic press and

African press, and I would assume the Coylonese pross. It wi

exactly the same, It was Communist propaganda.

Senator Schweiker. There is a wiitten memorandum or

wIitten order that is still in effect on this point?

Mr. Helms. It goes back to the early days of the found-

ing of the Peace Corps.

Senator Schwiker. I wonder if we could get that for the

record?

That is all.

Senator Baker. Let me ask you two quick questions.

Would you supply for us

now or later in one

of your subsequent

appearances some indication of how the CIA interacted or

cooperated with the DIA and the NSA?
