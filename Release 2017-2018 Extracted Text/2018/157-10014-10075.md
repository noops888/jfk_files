EXECUTIVE SESSION

Friday, June 13, 1975

United States Senate,

ect Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to
Intelligence Activities
Washington, D. C.
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10112 o'clock
a.m., in Room 5-407, The Capitol, Senator Frank Church
(Chairman), presiding.
Prasent: Senators Church (presiding), Morgan, Mart oft
Colorado, Baker, Goldwater, Mathias and Schweiker.
Also present: ‘illiam Miller, Staff Mirector; :

Madiqan and David Aarony Profussional Staff Members.

TOP SECRET



The Chairman. I am going to ask Fritz Schwarz if he would
give us a short rundown on what it is wa intend to focus on
in tha questioning today, what we expect to cover, what we hone
to get, and anything, I suppose, Mr. Smothers, that you would
like to add, just to give us a sense of direction in connection
with the proceedings this morning.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Helms was Dissell's Deputy during the

period that the Bay of Piqs was planned. Ile apparently was

kept pratty much out of that, that is both consistent with what

he sald yesterday and with what the written record appearn to

show.

V7

wanna raud

He took over as Deputy Director of Plans in the winter v°

fal

1962 and remained in that position ussentially until he becane

a

the head of the Agency in 1966.

n

4

The first thing that I think that we should cover with

7

him is to go through his perspsactive on what was happening

| with respect to Cuba generally without gatting to the assassine-
| tion question. On that ha's qoina to say, T belisve, based c:.
interviewing him yesterday and what he said to the Rockafellsr
Cunnission, that thers was continuing latesse prossure to do

something about Castro or gut rid of Castro or overthrow the

Communist yovernmant in Cuba.

i think he will say that in that connaction, in affect,

anything gous. Or, 48 Sunator Goldwatar put the auestion the

TOP SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32423463 Page 5


other day, there were not any limitations. But it's going to
be worth a little bit exploring with him and understanding what
he means. Does he mean that the CIA could have dropped bombs,
could have blown up ships in the harbor? What does he mean by
anything goes and what does he mean by there were no-limita-
tions? 1s

When we come to tha subject of assassination, I think
you will awe his testimony kind ot -botinga hack and fortn. On
the one hand, he is qoing to be saying, well, anything goes,
and that is something. On the other hand, he's going to be
saying, I think, wall there really wasn't anything woin7 in the

assassination araa.

We Will admit that he knew about Mr. Roselli; he will

admit, I believe, that he, indesd he and his man Harvey took
Over Koselli. But 1 believe you'll find the testimony, based
on what he said to the Rockefwller Commission and what he said :
yesterday, quite vague on that subject.

‘Wa will turn on that subject: before too long to the 19¢*
memo which is the most complete description of the avents in
connection.with Castro, fe had that prepared bucatine Presiden:
Johnson asked him to brief Prasident Johason on the allwtatic:
abuut Castro that were appearing in tha Prass. Then Johuson

hia own added Trujillo and Dien,

Senator Saker. Ia this the Drew Pearson article?

Mr. Schwarz. Yas, which President Johnson had baen

HW 50955 DocId:32423463

Personally told about and had been told additional details
on.

1 think he will say the memo is accurate, We will discuss ;
what he did after the memo was written telling people to destrcy
certain documents relating to the memo. We will have to. take

i him through the parts of tha memo which say he decided or he

agreéd with Harvey's decision not to brief McCone. But that is

stated on threw occasions in the memo. I think he will testity

eithar he remembers no such thing. That is what he said

yesterday and what he said to the Rockefeller Comission.
Morwover, I think he's going to disayres with ‘icCona's

testimony about icCone'n attitude toward eunination, and

at least say that he neVer heard “cCone express any doubts ataur
assassination, A, and N, that if McCone had such doubts he would!
have heard them,

Senator Baker. What's hs going to say, Fritz -- wall.
thought you were finished. Go ahead.

Mr. Schwarz. Another thing on Cantro. On the general
i subject of disclosures to President, I have a book on mail
opening which we should aot qet into the details of but isa
relevant in this seise, {in the so-callad tuston Plan which h=
and J. Edgar Hoover, Gayler and Bennett, General Sannatt,
signed thers was 4 flat statement, and this was in Jung 1979,
that mail opening has been discontinued that was siqned by hir

a submitted to Prasident Nixon. In fact, the mail opanine

project lasted into 1973 in New York and was just starting on
his authority in San Francisco at the vary time he was writing
President Nixon saying it had been discontinued.

“That 4s worth having him explain.

The Chairman. tlas he explained that to you previously?

Mr. Schwarz. Hw didn't, because we didn't have this in
mind. until afterwards. That is essentially it on the Castro.

The Chairman. What did ha say on the question of
Presidential authority in assassination?

Me. Schwarz. Well he puts it in this sense, Senator.
Anything goes, and wa knew the President wanted tha qovernman’®
ovarthrown.

The Chairman. Nothing mory specific?

Mr. Miller. I disaqres. If I might, 1 think this might
help, Fritz.

Yesterday in the discussion we followel the thema that was
raised by Bissell without stating where -- in fact, we did
! express, the notion of plausible dunial.

Mr. Schwarz. Yes, we should discuss that with hin, whar
dows it muan and #0 forth.

Nr. ‘tiller. And we came baldly out with the question,
could this have happaned without the President's approval. An.
I think, it is my lepeeentan and there mav be other gradings

on this, because he was vary careful in his answer, was he did

10 Few Steen, 5 € Wamenrton, OC. 29003

not think so. The President and the Attornwy General were aware

TOP SECRET

NW 50955 Docld:32423463 Page 8


things and the pressure of the times -- this is where
he is very qood -~ ha talks about the intense desire to do
something about Cuba, 90 miles off the coast and so on, that
there Was pressure, Very ‘atense pressura vithin the joveran
to mount operations and get things done.

Senator Goldwater. Would you ylald at that point?

Mr. Miller. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. I think it will be very helpful to
this Conmittes if we could, in some way, have Mr. Helms expla:
the philosophy that is wrapped up in the President knowing or
not knowing. This isn't confined to this Committee, this is
international and I think they have to protect the President.
And when Bissell said in wffact, yes, I would lie, ! would do
it to.

Hr. Miller. te got into that quastion yesterday.

Senator Goldwater. If wa could develop that philosophy,
because I don't think enough of the staff or enough of the
| meabers have ever been axposed to that kind of thinking. In

‘ other words, is it batter to have one man assassinated or havu

to qo-to war and all of us qet. back intothe business of killin:

thousands.
Mr. Schwarz. certainly says that there was intense
pressure and he explicitly naid that there ware no limitati

expressed with regard to that prassura. On the specitic of

410 Fen Sis9r. 5. wemnengton, OC, 20003

assasainations, he said that may have been discussed as an

TOP SECRET

BW 50955 DocId:32423463 Page 9


option but he is very fugzy when you get down to was it
actually discussed.

Mr. Smothers. What ia very helpful, I think, and we spent
nome tima with him yesterday, on simply going through his
impressions of how Mongoose developed and how he ‘had cone to
the feeling that-he articulated very clearly that there was no
doubt in his mind about what his marching orders were about
what thay wanted done, they. being the President on down.

We talked about the question of tha various sources of thir

kind of impr!

aion, mvetings he had with Cabinet people, meatinan
that Hr. NcCone would have, his conversations with HcCone.
While not explicit, it is vary clear that all of these meetinis
appear to him to be consistent.

I think tha other thing that may be vary heleful for ua
to try to get a close look at is the natures of tha coordination,
again as raflected by Mongoose. Here ww have a pulling tovether
of essentially all of tha government agencies in an effort to
I get a task done, and if wa focus on sonathing like, one,the
Attorney General's involvement, it appsers as he said vesterday
that the whole concept of the Special Group Auamanted was to
allow for the Attorney General's input, and also to provide
for the stewardship of Lansdale who, for the first time, whose role
becones a little clearer here 4s ws look at why tansdale comes

out of uowhers.

410 Fart Sirens, 5.€Wasematon, BC, 20003

I think 4£ we really pursue, the quastion of how this

TOP SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32423463 Page 10


Coordination effort looked, it will probably give us the best

_insight on the authority then.

I think I qlao found interesting yesterday his attitude
toward the Mafia people. Ile Clearly talks about then as just
another t, but his attitude -- and correct me if I’m wron:
here == was. more or less to pooh=pooh it. Here was something.
it was wild-eyed, it probably will naver work, but it's somethin:
we'll throw against the wall. And I think left us with the
impr. fon, okay, let him go out and try it. But, you know,
nobody really expects anything to coma of this, and he is
particularly pooh-poohed when he talks about what was expacte!
of Kosalli, And I believe he finally eaded up using the terr.
zilch as to what they would get out of that «ffort.

Aut I think probably the most valuable thing he can do for
us {s-to aive us noma of the impressions, soma of the faelincs
about what was going on in that timeframe. I don't think he's
terribly specific as to saying what.

Senator Bakar. ‘lay I ask a question, “ir. Chairman, and !
think a way to get him in hears is not to leave him out thare
with ban Schorr too lond. Tell ma about hia frama of mind,
his attitude. :

Doss he seem apprahansive, evasive? [a there any point
in us thinking while examining the witness, what is he holdin

back, if anything? [8 there any necessity, I think, to think

about the ponaibility of immunity?

Mr. Miller. I think the attitude that, number one, he
stated, I mean this is the statement, that he is going to
respond to any question by the conmitt fully. That was his
intention declared. :

Secondly I think that he feels that twenty-five years, his
twenty-five years of rvica to the government is under attack
now. le stated that it ie his belief that everything he has
done in government has been ‘under direct order or lawful
authority.

Senator Schweiker. From tha top, D111?

Mr. Miller. Yes, he was very heated on that point at one
point. 1 think 4t would be well worth, you know, pressing this
button.

So I think it is 4 mixture of saying vou nust understan?
the times. Helms himself was acting under lawful authority or
direction.

Thirdly, he wants to explain to the Committee why he did

thinas and so on. I must say that yasterday, trying to hold

| him onto a question was difficult.

Me, Schwarz. ie is a very, vary intélliaent witnees,
and if you ever want to pin the man down on precise facts, ha
knows very Well how to make that difficult.

ue. Miller. f think tha way you can draw tha moat infor-
mation out of him is asking him in the context of the times,

the procedures by which things were dona, and he tells more

f &bout in fact through impressions, he gets more precise {nfor-

ie
Mr. Schwarz. Just some procedural matters, Mr. Helms.

As we discussed, you know you have a right to counsel?

Mr. Helms. Yes, thank you.

Mr. Schwarz. And you have your constitutional rights, as
we discussed yesterday. And you also have the right to stop
and obtain counsel if you want, do you know that?

Mr. Nelms, . Thank you.

Mr. Schwarz. You joined the Agency at its outset, is
that right?

Mr. Nelms, Yon, Mr. Schwarz.

Mr. Schwarz. And you had bean in tha OSS before that?

Mr. Helms. Yes, I was in the OSS and then I went on to
the, what was later known as the SSU in the State and War
Departments. Then I was in the CIG and when the CIG was
subsumed in thy CIA, t went to the CIA which had been set up
under the National Security Act of 1967.

Mr. Schwarz. And you were on the operational side of the

| Agency or the clandestine sida, is that right?

Me. Helmay Yes. 1 started in what was known as the Office
of Special. Operations and that later became the clandestine
Service. And I was in that until 1965

Me. Schwarz. Moving to the late ‘59's, ware you the
Deputy Director for Plans?

Mr. Hwlms, No, I didn't -- let ma sea, I became Deputy

Director for Plans in early 1962.
Mr. Schwarz. All right.
Were you the second in command in the Plans section?

Mr. Helms. Yes. I had the title of Chief of Operations

which was the number two.

Mr. Schwarz. And you reported to Mr. Bissell?

Mr. Mtelms. I reported first to Mr. Wisner and then to
Mr. Bissell.

Mr. Schwarz. And then when Mr. Diasell lett in the winter
of ‘62 you left his place as the Deputy Nirector for Plens?

Mr. Melms, That {8 correct.

Mr. Schwarz. And you stayed in that job until you hecans

DCI, or did you have an intervening joh?

Mr. Helms, No, Iwas Deputy Director

Intelliqence which was a job that I received in I think it was
April of 1965. .

Mr. Schwarz. At about tha time Admiral Rayburn took

Nelms. MTxactly the same time.

Htalms, That is correct.

Mr. Schwarz, At that point, You went to your present

Fisenhower's Administration reqarded that devalonnent as a mon

how the balance could be redresaed.

These thoughts led to the project which over time has

come to be known under the rubric of the Bay of Pigs. It was
certainly not known as that when it began and {t.was bequn. as
@ project to organize Cuban exiles, Cubans who had bean exile?
by Castro from Cuba or had fled of their own volition, into 4

| Later to a very complicated series of negotlations to free
these prisoners or at least to free some of them.
You will recall also, because T think we must put in this
element that it was President Fisenhower under whom the original
t concept of mounting « guerrilla operation against the island
f cama into being, but by the time the execution of the operation
Was to take place, President Kennedy had come into office.
Therefore this Project had been at work under Presidents.
Tt has been said since ~- 1 don't know if this ts

get ahold of the aovernmunt apparatus hefora this thing was
presented to him and mounted and off it went. And this vas
pretty tough on him and pratty toutdh on everybody iavolved.

Subsequent to the Sav of Pigs, obviously there was 4
licking of wounds and a sort of reqrouping, and than as I
recall it, sometime in late 1961, I quess -- the Bay of Pias
I recall was in April of '61 --

Mr. Sewharz. April of ‘61.

Mr. Helms. So thia would have buen in the fall, Mike

etomach anymore for any invasions or any military fiescos of
that king.

The Chairman. Mr. Helms, could you be more spacific on
this particular point? 7 _

You say that in the fall of ‘61 after the regrouping and
the licking of wounds, the Agency received instructions to qat
on with a plan to get rid of Castro.

Now just from.whom did these instructions com

was the nature of the instruction. ‘Can you be more precise

about this? 7

Mr. Helms, Sir, Tam not very helpful in this peried here
for the simple ruason this cams to me second or maybe thir?
hand, and. it did not involve me particularly.

The Chairman. At the tims, what was your positio:
the fall of ‘617

Mr. Helms. I was Chief of Operations or the Neputy
Director for Plans. In other words, it was a number two job.

The Chairman. Secon! in command of covert operations?

Mr. Nelms. Yes.

The wav this had been worked, ‘ir, Bissell had come in
as Director of Plans, having been in the Agency and haviad bes
the ayent, if you remember, of U-2 operations and that kind,
and he brouyht those things with him into tha job of the npr
ant he spent. a good daal of tims prior to the Sav of Pius

working on that.

TOP SECRET

Page 20


In other words, fe was a big operation for an organization i
i for the CIA. In retrospect, far too big. So let's not shilly- !
4 shally with the words about that.

I think he spent 4 great deal of time on it, and my role
was to try and take care of what remained of tha world.
Therefore, I was absorbed outside, obviously on the fringes of
this, but not involved in the decisions or how it was to be
done or who was doing what or anything of that kind. :

So it was -- as I say, wa go downhill into, I think 1t

1) | my finger on axactly when, Mr. NcCone had by that time hecone

10 i: late-1961 or early 1962 and I'd have 4 hard tine putting
i Director. And as 1! recall it, this was the first time that Ff

was sort of brought into Cuban operations. “And he indicated

should interest myself nore on thin that we had to build. up

in order to conduct @ larqer wffort. :
And this then began. Then later, somewhat later, 1

became Deputy Director, I think it. was in Pebruary, and then

obviously these things came generally under my aeais.

‘ We set up sort of a task force in order to work on these
Cuban problems.

Schwarz. Was Mr. Harvey the man in charqe?

Nelms. tir. Harvey was then put in charge of that

sometime in this ting frame,

that may b; wrong.

Then later, and I don't know anymore in terms of tine;

} but a bit later, I believe, General Lansdale was brought in

to head up this Cuban effort.

Senator Schweiker. Within the CIA?

Mr. Helms. No, sir, I'm sorry. I'm not being very
Specific, Senator Schwaikar, I'll clear that up right now.

In tha CIA, we were informed that General Lansdal
was working in the Department of Defense in an office which f
think at that time was headed by General Frakine(?), it was
au office in the Department of Dafense which was dedicated to”
supporting covert operations and actions of the Central
Intelligence Agency. ‘That was one of its functions, amonq
others, 1 have no doubt, but that was one of them.

Dut. in other words, it was the point at which the CIA in
thess matters plugged into the Department of Defense. My

Fecollection is that ths proposition at first was that General

| Lansdaly was going to orqanize a whole oryanization underneath

 Rimself, sort of outside of other existing departmants and

agencies to work on this Cuban oneration.
ut in any event, that was a verv short-lived {daa because

T think “ir. McCone objected to putting, sending his people out

of the Agency to-be under somebody else's command. 1 think

j the Stats Department objected. So thet died aborning.

So the result was that General Lansdale became a sort of

Mr. Smothers, At this time, was the Attorney General

You had reached the missile crisis which waa’ in october
of 1962 and the missile crisis was rasolved by some kind of
an understanding between Chairman Khruschev and President
Kennedy. Do you know the nature of that: understanding?

Mr. Nelma. Well, my distinct recollection at the time

high level. members of the government.

Mr. Schwarz. And the pressure to have womethiag accom:

ascertain them, and it was ‘a result of that that f asked the
Inspector General to got into this mattor, and I realized that

able to get out of the various people they interviewed, but

it satisfied my requirement because it set in proper perspec-

them and enabled me to explain to President Johnson what had
been going on.

Mr. Schwarz, All right, in that connection, Mr. Reporter,
would you put in front of Mr. llolms the previously marked

Mr, Nelms. Well, at this late date Z can't say that wit

of thing that are those reminders out of 4@ report that you

Mr. Helms. I just can't answer that, I just don't know.
1 can't recall having done so.

What was it -- after he became President? Refresh my

Mr. Helms. I think I can't point to somebody else whose
Perceptions might be more accurate than mine. I don't think
that one would have approached the AMLASI thing as an
assassination plot against Castro. I think that one would have
approached that as an extension of our efforts to set 7 some
kind of opposition group to Castro inside Cuba of which Cubela
was, I guess, our prime opportunity, and that the pressures,
as I recall it, for guns and things of that kind all came from
Cubela himself, they didn't come from the Agency. This wasn't
something we wore trying to sot up. This waa something Cubela

was trying to sot up. lic hated Castro and wanted to get rid

of him.

Mr. Schwarz. The Agency facilitatad that by helping
him get guns; is that right?

Mr. Helms. I think the number of people we tried to
give guns to in the history of these Cuban operations was
multitudinous,

Mr. Schwarz. But you did give guns to Mr. AMLASH or --

Mr. Helms. If the record shows that we did.

Mr. Schwarz. And you just don't remember whether that
was disclosed to Prosident Johnson -- it occurred during his
Prasidency?

Mr. Helms. I don't recall it, but I can as I sit here

Mr. Schwarz. All right, now, would you look at Exhibit

7, which is the two-column

Senator Goldwater. Could I ask a question?

Did the CIA over do anything to try to find where these
ks came from?

Mr. Helms. Which leaks were those?

Senator colawater. To Pearson, to be able to write his

column.

Mr. Nelms. At the time this review was made, Senator

Goldwater, and I think that 1t appears in the back of it
somoplace, because that is what refreahod my memory == this ta
many years later. I am not saying I remamber all of theso
things just cold as that. But from reading this and trying

to remember concrete the circumstances of the time, thore was
an effort made to figure out who might have done this, and

I think it may well be that this is one of the reasons I have
got these names up in the top of those handwritten notes of
mine -- it might have been the lawyer, Ed Morgan, it might

be Roselli, it might be Mahou, or Garrison, who was out in
Los Vogas, with Maheu and some of the others. In other words,
1 think that is what. this note could very conceivably, the tov
one, refer to. It was for me to indentify to President Johnson
where this might have come from,

Senator Baker. Meaning that you wore listing the people

Mx. Helms. I am sorry, I can't see very well with my
glasses.

Mr. Kirbow. He has Exhibit 6.

Mr. Helms. These namos here just at the top where the
first line is Morgan, Roselli, Maheu, Garrison, March in Las
Vegas.

Senator Baker. Yes.

Mr.:Helms... At the vary top. Those names conceivably

could have related to my effort to identify to President

Johnson where the leak cama from. Underneath I see Morgan,

and Jack Anderson, and in those days Jack Anderson was a
principlo assistant to Drow Pearson, I believe, and he knew
Ed Morgan. That was probably a possibility where the
information could come from. But I don't know to this date
with any accuracy.

Senator Goldwater.. Did you ever chase it down?

Mr. Helms, No farther than that, Senator Goldwater.

I want to say that, since you have asked the question
that leaks to newspapers have been an albatross around my neck
for sc many years and have gotten mo obviously by hindsight
in more trouble than any other single thing and f don‘t know
of anytime except on one or two occasions when there was reall;

nothing was ever done about it.

All right, now, would you read the summary and state
whether it does in fact accurately reflect the facts as you
understood them at that point, or as you understand them now?

Mr. Halma, Well, as I look this over I think it is not
only ‘simplistic but I don't think it really accurately reflects
all of tho-facts.

1 would be hard pressed to tell you in specific instances
where it went wrong, but I noticed this business about hired
assassins and lone survivor and so.forth. I don't recall
anybody having any hard information this was the case. [
don't know that anybody ever demonstrated those men ever got

to Cuba. And the CIA hatched a plot to knock off Castro.

Ithink this is using Drew Pearson's lanquage, if Tam not

mistaken, because I can't imagine any Inspectors using language
like that.
Mr. Schwarz. But the right column is your Inspector's
language? i
Mr. Helms. That ia right. And IT think they are doing

their best to identify to mo in tho most simplistic and over-

these Drew Pearson allegations. But as I look at the facts
as we know them I think that they, too, are incomplete. :

Maybe some of tho other witnesses canflosh out some
of that for you. But let's, for example, say Roselli informed
Harvey presumably on the basis of information from Verona that
a@ team of three men was inside Cuba. That was never demonstrated
and I can only say that basod on Verona's track record and
Roselli‘s track record, those aro not very good witnesses.

Mr. Schwarz. Let's take the pills quostion, which is
under the heading of unpublished datails, The unpublished
detail, that is the detail which was qiven to Prosidant
Johnson informally, by Mr. Pearson. Is that your belief?

Mr. itelma. I guess so. I honestly don't know.

Mr. Schwarz. The first unpublished detail, pills were
sent to Cuba for use in the assassination, and your Inspector
General's staff said with respect to that, summarizing their
investigation, true. At least we wore told by Roselli that
the pills were sent in during Phase I.and again in Phaso II.

Phase I was the pro-Bay of Piga operation, is that right?

Mr. Holma. That is right.

Mr. Schwarz. And Phase II was the operation that occurrad
or allegedly occurred while you wore Deputy Director for Plans:
ia that right?

Mr. Hols. Yos sir.

TOP SECRET



“TOP SECRET”

Mr. Schwarz. Now, ia it so that the CIA was told that
pills wer sent in during Phase II?

Mr. Helms. My recollection of this is that there is

Pretty good evidence that the pills got as far as Plorida; that

the evidence is most unsatisfactory they evor went any further.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you authorize.at least their getting
to Florida?

The purpose of the pills was to kill Castro?

Mr. Helms. I believe they were poison Pills and I don't
recall necessarily on this day approving them, but since
Narvey alleges to have them and says that he took them to
Miami, I must have, I must have authorized them in some fashion.

Mr. Schwarz. And the study also aays that guna were
supplied during Phaso II for the purpose of assassination of
Castro?

Mr. Helms. Mr. Schwarz, that Phase Il with the Rosell:
and Verona so far to me ended up, if I may use the verieniae,
zilch. I don't believe that any of these things were done.
There was never satisfactory evidence adduced that these peo.
wero playing fair.with us. They were taking money and all the
rest of it. Nothing ever came of it and I am quite prepared
to believe to thin day 1 was a cock and bull story.

point. Whether they carried through as they represented the

would is quite a --

Mr. Helms. I realize that is true.

Chairman Church. You'did and the CIA did engage them
for the purpose of assassinating Castro, and pills were
supplied and guns wore supplied for that purpose. The fact
that they failed to do it or may not have carried through is
quite a different question.

Mr. Helms. I understand.

Mr. Schwarz. Let's look at the other item under
unpulished dotails. The item is quotes “There was a meeting
at the Department of State at which the assassination of
Castro was discussed"-- tha conclusion of your Inspector
General and his taff was truo;"tha subject was raised at a
meating at State on 10 August 1962, but it is unrelated to any
full attempts to assassination”, then they describe the
Lansdale momo that we have discussed previously.

But do you agree with their statement of true and that
it was unrelated, or not?

Mr. Helms. I, just don't know anymore. But there is no
reason for me to question the documents, and if tho documents
indicate that this was the case, I am prepared to accept it.

(i think I ought to make a dintinction between what 1
personally remember and what is in the documenta? but I
have no reason to fight the question.

Mr. Schwarz. As of that time, August '62, Mr. Harvey

was under you, he waa on your staff?

TOP SECRET



Mr. Helms. Ho was under my jurisdiction. In other words,

he was a part of the Deputy Director for Plans Office. i

Mr. Schwarz, And he was spocially assigned to Cuba?

Mr. Helms. He-was head of the task force which was tied
into the larger Government Operations under Lansdale.

Mr. Schwarz. You. knew that he was working with Mr.
Roselli, didn't you?

Mr. Helms. Yes sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, Exhibit 2, which was previously put
before you, is Mr. Harvey's memo to you of August 14, ‘62, and
it 4s also in all of the Senator's folders.

Mr. Htolms, Yos sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, he refers there to the August 10
meeting and to the fact that Mr. Lansdale had issued after
that a memorandum which stated that a planning document should
be prepared, including in‘ the case of CIA plans for tho liqui-
dation of leaders, is that correct?

Mr. Helms. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, as of August ‘62, you were cuace: as
you just testified, that Mr. Roselli and Mr. Harvey were in
touch, and Mr. Roselli had been retained for the purpose of
accomplishing assassination, ia that right?

Mr. Halms, I think what I was trying to say, as best 1
recall this, the Roselli effort Petered out and although he
stayed associated with Harvey and Harvey was in touch with him,
it was not a very long continued active and x use the word
active in the sense that the man was Pushing, prodding, hauling
in efforts to get something done. It didn't seem to me it
lasted vory long. It was Pretty quiescent for quite a long

time.

Castro opposed to the request to look at that an option
or plan?

Mr. Helms. I don't know. I wasn't at the meeting. I
was never told that this occurred. I don't know of any paper
that supports it. But I am sure maybe Mr. Harvey will remember.

Mr. Smothers.: What was your relationship with Mr.
Marvey? Did you select him?

Mr. Holma. I think I did. I think'I did: 1 know that

thare was some discussion at the time he was selected of trying

to find someone who was a hard-hitting officer to head up this
Cuban effort, and I certainly, if I didn't, actually was not
the one who first suggested it, I certainly approved the
Selection. I just don't remember anymore. It Lea likely that
I might have picked him. I just don't remember those details.
But it is silly of me to say flatly, yos, I selected Narvey
because I just don't remember the exact chain of circumstances.
But I ceratinly accepted him for the job, which is all your
are trying to find out, isn't it?

Mr. Schwarz. Was he working closely with you or was he
working more closely with the Director or with Lansdale?

Mr. Helms, No. Before he got this job in charge of
‘the Cuban task force he had heen the hoad of a staff known,ax

Mr. Schwarz. Did you know about the so-called Executive
Action or the portion of that ignamtn which alledgedly
related to a capability to kill or inate foreign leaders?

Mr. Helms. Well, in reviewing this, these papers, I
noticed that thera was something called ZR RIFLE, which
established and was referred to as an Exocutive action
capability, which is a pretty fancy title for one man who was
to constitute a cpability in being, as I understood it, under
Bissell‘s instruction. If you needed sommbody to carry out

out.

from having read the record?

Senator Baker. Could I ask a question, just briefly?

Do I understand from the tenor of these remarks that
ZRRIFLE really wasn't a big thing in the agency, in your
view, and you never thought much of it?

Mr. Helms. No.

“As a-matter of fact, it was a tiny little thing and I
noticed, ‘Senator Baker, in one of the pages here that Mr. Har-
vey said that he got this involved in his mind with some of tha
things he was trying to do on Cuba. I haveno recollection of
that whatever.

Senator Baker. Mr. Bissell indicated we ought to make

- a clear distinction betwoon the goncral effort to “oliminate

Castro or dispose of Castro,” and the ZRRIFLE oftort at
assassination of Castro.

Me. Helms. In most minds those lines never crossed.

Senator Baker. Sir? :

Hr-Helms. In my mind those lines never crossed. This
man was the ZRRIFLE fellow, I believe, was in Europe.

Senator Baker. Thank you.

Mr. Schwarz. Maybe this is confusing and you could |
cloar it up.

on page 38 of the study it states, after describing
exocutive action --. it states the following -- “The project

named ZRRIFLE first appoars in the files in May ‘61, although

the first recorded approval is dated February 1962. The new

DDP (Helms) on that date authorized tlarvey by memorandum to |
handle the project on a special basis. Accounting for expendi-~
tures was to bo by general category and on Narvey certification.
The initial approval was for 14,700, consisting of 7200 for
Q. J. Winn's annual salary and 75 for operational expenses”.

Then, it describes ZRRIFLE as ostensibly to develop
capability for entering safes and for kidnapping couriers, that
{t was separate from the operation against Castro until .
November 15, '61, and that on that date Harvey discussed with
Bissell application of tho ZRRIFLE program to Cuba.

Now, first, did you, as it says hore, authorize Harvey
to handle the ZRRIFLE project-on a special basis?

Mr. Helms. 1 guoss Imust have. hut may I explain
what I think undoubtedly was involved?

In the clandestine services we had a very careful
bookkeeping system that all monies had to be allocated against
specific projects and by proper authority because, as. you
Senators will remember, that when the Agency was set up under
the National Security Act of 1947, and then later Central
Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, there were authorities given
to the Director of Central Intelligence for use of unvouchered
funds and certification to tho use of those funds had to come
from the Director by law. And s0 every Director as far aa I know.
certainly with Mr. McCone and with me, we had a very care-

ful bookkeeping and auditing systom inside the Agency to be

TOP SECRET



gure when the year was over wa knew where almost avery single
dollar literally had gone during the year, so when we signed
the certification this had been used for proper purposes

we had some reason to believe it had been used for proper pur-
poses. So, you could have a project of a man getting a salary

unl

somebody authorized the establishment of the piece of
paper which gave the salary and gave the circumstances and

so forth and signed off on it.

Normally in most projects there was a clearance procedure

but with a sonsitive project, and this would have boon a

sensitive project, there was an oxcaption made to the general

ruls so that a specific officer could sign off on the use of

the money.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you understand ZRRIFLE as having one. or
two purposes?

Mr. Helms. I don't recall any more,

Mr. Schwarz. Did you understand that it had as one of
{ts purposes a capability to assanainate foreign leaders?

Mr. ielms. Well, I think that Harvey would have played
fair with me and said this was something Bissell] asked me to
setup and we have got it hero and here is this man and

so forth.

Yos, 1 don't think thore was any doubt about it, but

“TOP SECRET

there is a great deal of difference between establishing a
capability and using it.

Senator Baker. On that point, though, was it also in the:
contomplation of the parties, as we lawyers are fond of saying.
that ZRRIFLE had a capability for the jsination of Cas~
tro?

Was that discussed?

Mr. Helms, Nover that I heard of, Senator Baker, 68
best J, recall those circumstances.

In other words, you sac, thore is 6 passage in hore which

says that these two lines cross. This finds no place in my
recollection.
Senator Baker. Thank you.

Senator Schweiker. Tho point on thephysical lines of

authority you just dosciibed, to pay people under your
youchered system, then would the CIA issue checks to these
people or was it done by cash as a rule, or how did that
voucher follow-up occur under physical control?

Mr. Helms. We did it variously. Sometimes actual
cash was passed to a sensitive agent. ;

For example, you might pay him in Indian rupees, then the
man who passed the moncy would sign in the office a certifi-
aon under the eryptonym of this operation saying on auch and

such a day he passed X Indian rupees to agent so-and-so.

that cash?
Mr. Helms. In cach station overseas there was either
a finance officer whose full time job was finance, if
it was a large station, or another officer who had a part~
time job of keeping the accounts for.that station.
So, whon the auditors went around there was also
somebody who could present to thom the books for that station

of exactly how much money had been oxpended in the previous

month, and wo wore enormously scrupulous about this thing.

Was that correct? Is that correct, as you understand it?
Mr. Nelms. 1 don't know of my knowledge that Robert
Kennedy was ever asked to specifically approve an assina-
tion plot. That he was briefod on gambling syndicate phase onc

ia certainly true, and the record shows that.

T don't recall about phase 2. I don't recall briefing hin
myself on it. whether anybody else may have briefed him or
not I don't know. But out of my resources and my recollec-
tion I don't recall his having baen briefad on it.

Mr. Smothers. Would it be necossary for him to be
briefed on phase 27

Mr.Helms, I would have thought not, sir.

tion if I had gone and done it.

Mr. Smothers. Are you saying then that he was suffi-
ciently involved in the activities and intentions of

not have. But I think that Harvey kept phase 2 pretty much

in his back pocket.

would this approval have taken place with his concurrence?
Mr. Helms. I don'tknow, air. The phase 1 business is

something I had almost .nothing to do with and got into

rather late in the game and my perceptions would be of no

assistance to you, I don't think.

The Chairman. Those questions are important to the

Committes because the documents suggest and the testimony, if
you correctly remomber it, seems to suggest that when Me.
Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, was informed about phase 1,. it was
done in the past tonse «= the documents bear that out --

and phaso 1 had in fact been terminated.

So, well, the briefing related to that phase of the
operation which has been terminated?

Mr. Nelms. | That {# right.

The Chairman. We don't know whether Robert Kennedy was
ever advised of the so-called phase 2 part?

Mr. Helms. No, sir, I don't. And I must say that the
presumption based on the papers I have seen within the last
two or three days, would indicate that. he.was. not; but I
don't know this for sure. :

or Bill Rogers ordered it or knew about it, it is done and gona
and we know I think quite a bit about the total operation.

But I don't think it is fair to try to assign by this
line of of questioning blame..

The Chairman. That isn't the purpose of the questioning,
I don't think, Senator. It is to determine how these things
worked, what the line of authority. may have been, and if it
ia true that a ination plots can-be carried out without
the specific knowledge of the highast people in the govorn-
ment, this Committee ought to know that and we ought to
considor whethor that is tolerable.

That is the reason for the questioning.

Mr. Schwarz. Could’ we pursue --

Senator Baker. Before you do I think both Senator
Goldwater and you are correct in a way but I think wo need to
refine that point a little more because I think it will bo
helpful in our further evaluation of this witness’ testimony
and our general undertaking.

It may be that the facts will not yield up the conclu-
sion on whether the President or the Attorney General at any
point in time knew of these undertakings. It may be that
the most we can do is indulge in conjecture or surmise. We have
three alternative possibilities, it seems to mo, that are
relevant to the inquiry of this committee, and tho problema

that wo will make.

TOP SECRET

Page 63


One, the President did know and was preserved in
deniabiiity and it cannot be established. I doubt that we
reach that conclusion.

Two. That we are not sure but that the force of
circumstances, operating procedures, intuition, but better
still expert testimony from those who were in the committee
probably knew, it is unlikely someone would have acted without
authority or, three, that the CIA was acting on its own in an
irresponsible way in matters of extraordinary importance.

Tho Chairman, Yes.

Senator Baker. To tha extent that we focus on

two or three it is important. To the extent we focus on one
and try to strain desperately to find out Robert Kennedy or
John F. Kennedy knew or didn't know is not important, but I do
think it is terribly important to ask Mr. Holms, and with
your permission I am going to ask him right now, whether or
not in any situation that he knows of in conjunction with any
assassination efforts against Fidel Castro, whether ornot

he or anyone he knows of in the CIA acted in a way that he
would conceive as being beyond their authority and

beyond the instructions they received from some authority?

Mr. Helms, Sir, I believe to this day that in these

actions we were taking against Cuba and against Fidel Castro's

government in Cuba, that thoy were what we had been asked

In other words, we had been asked to get rid of Castro,
and as I said a little earlier, there were no limitations
put on tho monies, and wo felt we were acting well within
the guidelines that wo understood to be in play at this parti-
cular time.

to me that the further inquiry of this committee, of the

furthor deliberation of this committee at this point

ought to be whether or not we ought to at this timo even

up lines of communication between tho ultimate civil author-
ity of tho U.S. and the intelligance community so there is
an expreaued and provable line of authority or whathor it
functions adequately in its present format.

1 was taking a deposition.

Mr. Helms. Good morning, Senator Mart.

Senator Hart of Michigan. You tell us that it is your
impression that nothing done with respect to Castro by the
Agency was done without authority.

Do 1 understand that correctly?

. Mr. Helms, It was done within the guidelines of
yi ; appropriate authority. In other words, we folt that we were
operating aa we were supposed to operate, that these things

if not specifically authorized at least wore authorized in

general terms.

Does it moan that you understood) that the highest

government fall and that in sone fashion Castro go away?

Mr. Holms. Senator Mart, I think) you put it very well.

Senator Hart of Michigan.All right

Now, do you assumo. from that, that being the general
authority, that there was nothing you had.to check back with,
like the sinking of a Sovict ship in Havana harbor, or napalm-

You ‘aay with respect to that that you weren't told not |
to do it and you weren't told in so many worda to do it, but :
you understood that that was within the peramaters of the gener-
a1 policy?

Mx, Helrs. Yes.

The Chairman. Now, &t is quite hard for me to under-
atand how you go back and check constantly with the Special
Group on ordinary sabotage operations but you have
apparently no such communication with the Spacial Group on an
assssesination plan againat the Cuban leader.

Can you explain that?

Mr. flolme, I understand your puzzlement and I don't
know whether I can satisfactorily put the matter to rest in
your mind, I will do my best.

The item that seems to loom large in this I.G., report
is the use of John Roselli in-phase 2.

Ag I testified earlier this morning, as beat 1
can recall the circumstancea at the time, 1 did not have much
hope for what Roselli might be able to do hut I was prepared
to have Harvey work with him to see if there woro lines
that the underworld had into Cuba.

in all fairnese and honesty that dn the perceptions of the tim

people were lowing their lives in raids, a lot of people
had lost their lives at the Bay of Pigs, agents were being
arrested laft and eight and put before the wall and shot,
and that, therefore, this operation of Roselli's with the
pills would soem to me to be s very fecble operation under
the best of circumetances and indeed turned out to be one.

Frankly, at the time it didn't loom large and that is
not bacausa Xr don't have any moral judgment or beacause I am

thie was one human life against many other human lives that

the Chairman. Rven in the perception of the timcs.
when you engaged elements of the Mafia to perform and operation
for the CIA, that if it had worked out as hoped would have
resulted in the assassination of Castro, then you tell us
that you didn’t bring dt to the attention of Mr, HcCone
because you didn’t think that “Le was that important, and
that he had any particular need to know about ie.

That atrikes mo as being very strange. T should think
that if there waa one thing that the Director of the CIA

Senator Mathias. When Mr. Bissell was here I think I
asked him whether the job of communicating with superior
authority was one of ‘protecting superior authority, and
specifically the President, protecting him from knowladye ant

Mr. Helms, I think that Allen Dulles did know about

Senator Mathias. Obviously this is not the kind of
subject that urbane and civilized men would particularly want

Mr. Helms, I think that probably Mr. Dulles dealt with

something you felt you couldn't discuss with anybody else,

then discuas with his Immediate assistants those things which
seemed to be proper for them to.halp you out with, go to the

I think Directors have always had access to the President if .

thay want to insist on it. I think there has grown up a
little bit of an imprassion that thie is not the case, but
e@ach Director has to decide how he 4a going to work for the

was known as the Tuesday Luncheon Group and when I did not
see him there, which was a small group where one had opportunity
if necessary to speak to him privately, f saw him frequently
in National Security Council meetings and also moctings having

to do with the Middle Fast, with Vietnam, and things of thae

Mathias, because Dr. Kissinger and General Haig ware both very

across, and when on two or three rather important occasions

Presidert Nixon in National Security Council meatings told me

‘what ne wanted done on certain things in front of the others.

in tho latter part of that -- let me start again, because you

Senator Hart of Colorado. Yes.

Mr. Halme, And whon I used the word guidelines,
unfortunately I am not a lawyor and somotimos I get into words
that convey different moantngs to lawyers than they do to us
lay folke., £ am just rotarring to the kind of thing you saw
in this memorandum of General Lansdale’s that here we are going
te do psychological warfare, political, military, economic and
so forth. That was what I was Kefarring to as guidelines

Senator Hart of Colorado. But you would admit, and oven
though I thinkwe have ostablished, the Chairman has establishat
that the purpose of this Committee is not to find a amoking
gun or point a fingor at a villain, what we are after is how
these things get startud, how they are directad and controlled,
and whether, as Sonator Mathias was pursuing, whether people
at the top want to ‘know specifically what is happening. But
tha Buck ‘ocs have to stop somewhere in terms of carrying out
what 1s the explicitty purpose of a mission. orders to be given,
contracts have to be signed, money has to be authorized.
Somebody has to do thone things. And 1 think that is what we
are all trying to pin down, at this time, under those
€ircumstances, who was doing those things.

And I think the counsel may have been touching one point

or anothor on the $100,000, for oxample, to.the Mafia contacts.

Mr. Helms. $150,000? Which era was thia?

wanted to get straight in my own mind what some of this money
waa,

Senator tart of Colorado. That is all.

Mr. Holme, May 1 contribute Something, please?

Tha Chairman. Yea, certainty,

Mr. Holme, As a result of my *xperiences through thy
years, whon 1 became Nirector 1 had made up my mind that this
option, 1f you want to put 1t that way, of killing foreign
leaders, was something that f did not want to happen on my
watch, My reasona for this were these:

There are not only moral reasons but there are iso some
other rather practical reasons.

1. Tt ie almost impossibia in a Democracy to keep
anything Like that secrot, {£ you will examine human behavior
you will find that the toughest nut one day six yoars later
may bocome just a woakling running for cover, looking tor
apalatanca somwhery, F think i€ would he almont impossible,
ff To may put it that way, to keep such a thing secret for any

Protractod length of time. Somebody would go to a Conyresen,

hia Senator, he might go to a Rewapaper man, whatever the case
fay be, but ft just te hot @ practical alternative, it beams
to me, in our society.

Then there ig another consideration which comes inte
this. That if you are going to try by this kind of means to

fomove a foreign leader, then who is going to teke his place

Tunning that country, and are you asentially hetter off as a
Ratter of practice when it ts over than you were before? And
T ean give you I think @ very solid example of this which
happened in Vietnam whon Preaidont Diem wos eliminated from
the econo. Wo thon had a revolving door of pring ministers
after that for wuite some boriod of time, during which the
Vietnamese Government at a timo in ite history when it shoutd
havo boon strong was nothing but a Caratekar government,
constantly, in other words, that wholo exercisg turned out to
the disadvantage of the united States,

So when one looks at the scope of this thing this is
why I am contributing the time. after all there is no sense
in my sitting here with all tho experience I have nad and
not sharing with the Committee my feelings this day. ore
isn't bocause I have. lost my cool, or because It have loa
my guts, it eimply is because’ t don't think it is a viable

option tn the Unitad States of Amorica these days, .

Mr. Helms. Well, it's an interesting point you make,
because theoretically this would not be the case. but thera
wee a situation {a which he qot himself very much on the othar
side of the fence from the President and that waa over the
question of whether there ware missiles in Cuba or not, or

saying thay were not Putting them in and wouldn't be Putting
them in and he turned out to be right.

And I think in all fairness to Mr. MeCone, I think it's
f fair to be said that he made himself slightly unpopular with
the President for having been. right.

Mr. Smothers. This is a fairly omali qroup we're talking

Mr. Sewharz, Okay.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Wall, with all respect, © would
like Counsel to continue the final question,
Me. Sewharz. The document wa're talking about was a 1967

study and it was prepared for you so that you could brief

Praaident Johnson and did you ever tall anybody you thought

there was somathing wrong about that, about the document, or
that i¢ was inaccurate?
Mr. Helms. No, as I testified this morning, Mr. Schwarr,

I don't recall studying the document 190 Percent from the

standpoint ‘of the accuracy of it, eavary sentence. I wae trying

to relate it to some information which It had been given, which

it appeared in a newspaper to try and sort out tha facts go

|, that I could report to President Johnson certain avants which

occurred at cartain places in time, and I do not recall that

I ever went over this document line hy {ne to check on the
veracity of 4t, and I certainly never want behind the

i Inspectors <~ in cther words, I didn't talk to the people

individually concerned whom they had interrogated.

Mr. Schwarz, But you don't recall telling anybody that

“ there was something wrong with it.
Mr. Helms. No, I don't recall doing that.

Mr, Sewharz., Now the document indicates that in May 1962

: pills were in Cuba. Now, assuming that was 80, the reporting .

; Chain was that Mr. Harvey was expacted to Yeport to you, is
; that right?
Mr. Helms. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. And your assumption is. that Mr. Harvey
as a good ligutenant, did report to you, is that right?

Mr. Helms. Well he was reporting quite regularly what was

goiag on, Whether he reported everything or not, 1 obviously
“don't know.
Mr. Schwarz. But is it your expectation that he would
: have reported a matter lika the pills being in Cuba?

Mr. Helms. I would have thought so.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, you knew in May 1962 that there was a

Me. Helma. Yes.

Mr. elma. I was told subsequently that he was.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, turning to page 65 of the document

Mr. Helms. Yes, I have it.

Mr. Schwarz. -- in the second full paraqraph, it reads:

‘ “Harvey states that on 14 May he briafed Mr. Helms on @ meeting
with the Attorney General, as told him by Edwards, Harvey. too,

advised against briefing Mr. McCone and General Carter and

states that Helms .concurred in thia.”

Senator Morgan. Wa

yOu ever satisfied as to who he was

really working for?
‘Mr, Helms. I have-never been satisfied with any of these
Operations as to exactly who was working for whom. If it was

ever a frustrating time in my life, it was trying to gat these

Cubans to do the things they said they were going to do.

‘ ona point.

Mr. Scwharz. And after tha November ‘63 meeting, at

it, did the Agency arrange to supply him with guna as well?
Mr. Helms, I dom't'know. I think thet ali through: the

Cubela period, there were requests from him for guna.of various

" caches in Cuba. This is an ongoing preoccupation of providina
. caches of arms and explosives and so forth to various groups
that we though’ might have some possibility of mounting an

I wouldn't question that he had asked for guns and maybe
iy in the end he was able to get some. Somehow, if my memory of

Is it not true that when he eventually did get some guns
or something he got them from Artima rather than the CIA case

Mz, Schwarz. And that the CIA erranged that that would
happen. ;

Mr. Helms, Well, I think they put the deal together, but
I don't know wheather the Agency actually arranged it or not.

Mr. Schwarg., But Cubela was an agent -- now agent may

be the wrong word -- Cubela was a person with whom the Agency

had contact.
Mr. Helms. That's right.

Mr. Schwarz. And Cubela was « person for whom the Agency

Now, did you know about that?

Senator Morgan. Or if he had just talked to one of his

undoubtedly was talking to somebody in Cuba.

Senator Mathias, I think Senator Morgan might have gotten
the point, just a little boasting. .

Senator Morgan, That's right. It's logical the man would
have done a little boasting.

Senator Schweiker. T have one question on Castro.

Mr. Helms, if in fact Castro did know of these plots, and
it's hard for ma to understand thet he did not, given ali the
i facts that we have seen, might this not have Precipitated 4
climate hounded by the Day of Pigs that really fostered the
Cuban missile crisis that made Castro go out looking for ways
to get even with us? Is not that a rea) possibility, that if

in fact we did know of our attempts to kill him?

Mr. Helma. Yes, but -- I had always understood that the

| Cuban missile crisis was something that was generated by the
Soviets and their desires and that they approached Castro to

: do this. Maybe his willingness to go along might have been

j affected by it, but there cannot be the slightest doubt that
Castro, when he cama toe power, must have been kaanly aware that

If on the very day that tha President was assassinated,

We were talking with Cubela in Paria and telling him that the

; pen was being given to him with the full knowledge of Robert

Kennedy, it would seem clear to me that somatime in prior
negotiations that it would have been conveyed to him that.

Robert Kennedy had knowledge of what was qoing on, whether --

“Mot saying Kennedy did or not, but I'm saying it's fair to as-

i sume that Cubele thought that Kannedy was a part of it, and

therefore aven in boasting or as double-agent for soma time

prior to the Kennedy assassination, may very well have dropped

ongoing authority to indicate that the government was behind
such an action, therefore you hadno need to check it apactfically

Mr. Kennedy that he would have said yes, that I don't think
there waa any need to.

is what we were trying to do.

Tf I may point out -~

Mr. Madigan. Would that necessarily exclude assassination,

TOP SECRET



Mr, Ambassador?
Mr. Helms. May I include agatn that Major Cubela's

desire for these wespons and thie desire of his to hit castro

by murder or killing was not part of our desiras at all. This

| Waa going to ruin Our whole plan, if ha inaisted on thie, And
T think you'll find 4f you get all ef the telegrams, you'll
find that there was an enormous amount of temporizing with this
fellow to keap him on the tean, to keep him working away at the
Job, but to try and bersuade him that this was not the way to

go about it,

I think this has to show in tha Fecord, hecause Cubela

Operation because it waa one of the few live ones we got ahold

Mr, Schwarz. You mean you wanted him as a apy or a source
of information as opposed to a killer?

Mr. Helms, We wanted him aa a SPY, a8 a political action
agent. We didn't want him to go around killing people.

Senator Baker. What did you give him the pen for?

Mr. elms. Aecause he was insisting on something and this
was a temporizing gesture rather than giving him some kind of
4 gun he had asked for, as 1 recall,

Mr. Helma, I don't have any way of coming up with any
other than the ones we have discussed. :

Senator Baker. Well, how many {9 that? Can Counsel tell
mo? Nine ie the figure that comes to mind.

Mr. Schwarz. I would say a lot, Senator.

Senator Baker, Wall, lat's see. There was the poison in

‘the diving suit. There was the depilatory to make his beard

" don't know how many that is, but there are a gredit number. But

" there was. no question on earth that they Were to kill Fidel

1 Castro, is that true?

“Mr. Helms. But, sir, the diving suit never went anyplace.
Tt was never put in anybody's hands. It was just an idea that
somebody had.

Mr. Schwarz. But it was bought and the poison was put

| inside it,

TOP SECRET



210 Fon street, $f wanton, GE, 20003

Mr. Helms. Yes, but it never left the laboratory in
Washington, 0.C,

And the shell, this was a cock-ayed idea from the outset.
Thia was the highly intensive imagination of a fellow who

thought, well why wouldn't this be a great idea, but a totally

impractical thing. I mean, I cannot call that a plot.

| Senator Baker. But there are others, let's not call it a
Plot, call it playing with fire, Lf you want to, but it's sort
of a dangerous thing to do even, just to contemplate with any
official sanction of an organization, killing someone alae.

Tt doesn't make any difference really how far it went.
The point I'm trying to maka da, it seems to me-a long jump

from nine plans to kill Fidel Castro by assassination to saying

; that we gave the poison pen to a fellow not to kill him, but it

i Was to placate him.

Mr. Helms, Well, maybe I read these words wrong, and maybe

my recollection at the time is imperfect. But § thought that

this operation was really designed to not only get information

through Major Cubela, but to try and organize a political

action operation inside Havanna and at no time was it the ides
; Of his case officers, or those people in the chain behind,
to use him to assassinate Castro, These ideas came from him

and he kupt raising tham at these meetings.

Am I wrong? The telegrams must show something. Do you

have the telegrams from that period?

Mr. Schwarz. You remember Mr. Lumumba?

Senator Baker, Lat me ask one question, T hate to bring |
it up, but I can't resist, since the Ambassador is hare and ;
will not be back anytime soon.

To advart to ancther unhappy pariod in our life, to go
back to the Watergate hearings, and Particularly to the White

i
House tapes, there was a conversation recorded on those tapes

which waa released dated June 23, 1972 which was of general

interest, but one of the things in that tape was a remark

attributed to President Nixon having to do with the cooperation
Of the CIA and saying, in effect, that we've done a lot of
things, or protected Helms from a lot of thinns,

Do you have any idea of what he's talking about?

Mr. Helms. I have never known, Senator Baker, I have evar
gotten any personal courtesies from President Nixon that I was
i aware of. 1 don't know that ha ever intercedad for me anyplace
7 that I know of except to the extent that as Brasident of the

United States and in connection with my official duties he
might have supported a request I had for some assistance in
Lacs for some money or something of this kind.

But when I read that on that tape I could hardly belleve
"RY ayes, because I had no idea what he was referring to.

Senator Baker. Thank you, sir.

Mr. Schwarz, I wonder if before turning to Lumumba we

showing on the second Page that you signed that feport preparad
for the President.

Now de that the report that ia Feferrad to as the so-called

Mr. Helms. If you say it 18, I have no reason to quarrel
jy with i€. r just don't remember the official name of that
| Feport, and certainly if it says I signed some report here,
and that's the report, then Let us agrees that it is.

Mr. Schwarz. And you do recall, wa talked about it
{this morning, that there was an effort in tha summer of 1970

that resulted in a document of this sort, right?

Mr. Helms. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Okay.

Now, that was prepared at the request of President Nixon

My recollection of what they ware diract-
ing their attention to was improved and more effective in-
formation developed on domestic affairs in the United States
on not only dissidents but penetrations of foreign intelli-
gence services and activities of foreign intelligence ser-
vices, and ao forth. I don't say that other things aren't
covered in the report but my recollection of what tha whole
purpose of the exercise was to try to improve coverage in the
domestic field,

Mr. Schwarz. And in that connaction to tell the prosi-

dent whether there were certain restrictions on the ability

of the intelligence agencies to operate that might be lifted:

ig that right?

amo w pau.

Mr. Nelms, Yes, it strikes me that what he had aaked

non

for originally was for a wide-ranging report on all of the
things that got in the way of improving this domestic
coverage from the FRI and NSA and so forth eo he could conei-
der what these various obstacles were or were considered to
be, such as laws and traditions and things of that kind.

Mr. Schwarz. One of the techniques which the Committee,
including yourself focussed on, was the one callod math
coverage; is that right?

Mr. Helms, I assume so. Yes, we have a heading hore

mail coverage, right.

Schwarz. You signed it?

Helms. I signed it.

Schwarz. All right, that wasn't true, was it?

Helms. You see, what I don't know hora, sir, I
wouldn't knowingly have signed something that didn't
believe to be true, and I don't know whether thie was referring
to covert coverage by the FBI or somebody else. At least the

agency was going to be at that time with this same smail

operation in New York that had been going for some 20
years, but I can't imagine that it was referring to that
because otherwise I would be signing something that wasn't

true, and J would have no reason for doing {t. 1 could haave

it stuck out so I can only assume in the context of working

level meetings which produced this report this must apply to
something the FBI had been doing or planning to do.

Mr. Schwarz. How would President Nixon know that.
As far as he was concerned he was reading a document that
says flatly covert coverage has been discontinued and he
kind of got in a lot of trouble on this, you remember the re-

lease of the Huston Plan, and that it went on and President.

Mr.tlolms. If you were wanting to single me out, Hr.

that we are talking about an Far effort here,

Mr. Smothers, Can you think of anything to be gained

Mr.Melms. Absolutely nothing, and you know this CIA

operation in any event was on a very narrow focus. 1 believe

in this connection a thought here was to have a great deal
more coverage involving other parts of the world. CIA
operation Involved juat the Soviet Union and this desire, if

recollection serves at all, to expand this domestic

collection was not necessarily in the field of Russia, it

was in a lot of other fields.

T think might be helpful to this conversation, .

The CIA and military investigative agencies have found
mail cover halpful. Then 4t goos on to say that
covert coveraga has been diacontinued because Congressional
hearings involving accusation of governmental invasion of
privacy.

Those were hearings of Army spying, not CIA spying. f
Suggest that I am net entire clear, maybo this interfaces
with the Army or Defensa Department rather than the CIA in

ite focus on the question of continuance,

Mr.tielms, That is helpful, because raally Tt truly
believe it has to he aomething like that.

Senator Baker, 1 do know that senator Ervin was
deeply involved in the invasion of privacy military apying
situation, ‘That was the one I believe that get 80 much
publicity and related back to the Ruston Plan.

Mr. Schwarz. I wonder if the sentence that Senator
Baker focussed on which is the second sentence at the top,
CIA and military investigative agencies have found this
information particularly helpful in the past.

Doesn't that connote to a reader that both for the
CIA and the military it is a past matter?

Mr. Smothers.I think we have really asked the witness
about the extont of his knowledge on this. Maybe we ought

In other words, this authorizing some document or other

The question has come up. about whether or not weapons were
passed in the pouch,the official pouch to the Dominican
Republic, and I was suggesting, as you remember yesterday
afternoon, I don‘t Know whether those cacords exist any more,
but I was really seriously . wondaring whether the actual
State Departmnant pouch had ever been used for such a purpose
because I had put a watch dog on the pouch for the simple
reason that we were using State Department facilities, that
they had certain regulations about the kind of things that
should go in the pouch, and I wanted to be certain that year-in
and year-out there were not abuses of the pouch privilege

because of the terrible temptation on the lowest level for

employees to want to send perfume and other customs items
through the pouch to avoid paying duties and so forth, and

that also there are all kinds of abuses that one can make

over a pouch that can't be opened by foreigners or domestics.
So, I had the widow of a foreign service officer
periodically on this job to be sure there weren't violations
of the pouch, and if it should come to me there should be a

In other words, this is not something that somebody

could do just by saying send this package in the pouch
Mr. Schwarz. The record shows some Weapons were sent
through the pouch,the record being the report made to you
in '67, Dut I asked you, I think, whether you knaw in
1960 ox 1961 that the U.S. Government had supplied weapons
to dissidents in the Domincan Republic.
Mr. Helma, I am sorry, Mr Schwarz, I don't remember.
T mean I could have known, I don't think I knew. I don't think
TI was involved in that Part of the operation, But, on the

other hand, with all of the things that have gone on through

theyears it could have been that I have been told about this.
Mr. Schwarz. Then I take it also follows you can't
add anything as to whether or not the Agency had authority to
Supply guns at all, number one; had authority to supply
guns for the purpose of sssassination, number two?
Mr. Helms, I thought that when I was reading this I.G,
report that there was a voluminous amount of telegraphic

Sorrespondence and memoranda and so forth about every move

in this whole thing being cleared with the State Department

and so forth.

Are these things not covered in that record?

Mr. Schwarz. There was a great deal of discussion of
clearance with the State Department, Indeed, there is a man
¢alled Deerborn who is in the State Department who appears

to be a inotivating foree.

What isn't entirely clear is whether Particularly at
the last month the knowledge of the persons on both sides
of the fence or in the Agency and outside Ls on an equal
footing. Ali things except for that are clear and I take it --
Mr. Helma. I can't help on that. I am sorry, I recally
can't. ~

Senator liart-of Michigan. Do any members have any
questions of the Ambassador?

Senator Schweiker. Yes.

You gave us your philosophy, Mr. Ambassador, on aseassi-
nations a moment ago, and I believe you inferrad, and maybe
said to the staff earlier, that during your tenure sa
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency there were no
political assassinations that took place.

Am I putting words in your mouth?

Mr. Helms. No, you are not. I said that.

Senator Schweiker. That is correct,

I wonder again, for the guidance of this committee,

you haven't gotten into this other area yot, but I think in

view of your one statement and your experience it would be

helpful, what was your policy as Director of Ceneral Ingelliuence
on what we have read about in the press and media and books

and, et cetera, on termination of assets who have outlived

their usefulness or termination of other agents? I wonder

if you would for the record philosophically tell us your

TOP SECRET

policy on that while you were Director.

Mr. Helma. Yea, sir. These exotic phrases are
euphemisms that are used to describe these purposes, none
of them were dndulged in with my permission and I don’t
believe they were indulged in at all. 1 just aimply did
fot believe in this method of taking care of one's embarrass~
ments, {f you want to call it that, and I never authorized
any cuch actions at any ‘time.

As IT explained this morning, it 1a not only the moral

question involved but in our form of country and with our

philosophy and, if you like, ‘theology, it aimply ian’t an

acceptable way to do business and, therefore, other methods
have to be found.

I know in the literature of espionage and secret wars and
so forth, particularly British, French, German, Russian, and
so forth, there are references to the fact when an agent,
secret agent becomes an embarrassment he was eliminated, he
was gotten rid of. But I just don't believe that this was 3
viable system, either morally or any other way, for us to
conduct ourselves with people who had gone sour and we just
tried to find ether methods of taking care of the problem.

Senator Schweiker. In the earlier days, before your
tenure as Director, was this always our policy,or maybe
carlfer in the era of the CIA this was not aa firmly eatab-

lished or left to local option.

What is your recollection, not whan you were Director,

but policies preceding that, from your experience? t

Mr. Haims. I don't recall any incidents of agents that !
went sour being elimfnated during any of these 25 years.

I really don't recall any incidents of thie. 1 can't Bay

that other times it’ might not have happened and I never

learned of it, but I don't know of any.

Senator Hart of Michigan. That ig all I have.

Mr. Schwarz. I think you said now, or you said earlier,
that killing or assassination, killing of agents or assasaina-
tions of political leaders were both impractical, because of
the iikellhood of exposure, and so forth, and undesirable or
unacceptable to our socioty, right?

Mr. Helms. Yes, that is right.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, you also have said that, focussing
on the Castro operation, ‘there the pressure to get rid of Castro
or to overthrow the Castro government constituted an author-
ization, at least an implicit authorization to kill him, to’
assassinate him,

Is that right? .

Nr. Helms, Yes, I think that ia generally an accurate
phrasing of it.

Me. Schware, Now, there is a conflict.

Not a conflict but a tension between: those two pieces

your testimony.

Mr, Halma, Right.

Mr. Schwarz, Now when you became Director, so that
you were in charge and recognized that you knew that efforts
had been undertaken to assassinate Mr. Castro under the
general instruction to overthrow his government, and recog-
nizing further that it ia your attitude or it 1s your testimony
that you thought that waa unacceptable for both practical
and moral reasons, did you take any steps to issue an instruc-
tion to prevent such activity from occurring again?

Mr. Helms. Well, I do know that, and I don't recall now
the means that this manifested itself ia, but I certainly
made it clear to my senior associates when I was Director,

I simply didn't want this to go on, and I think if you will

talk to them you will find that they understood this very

clearly.

Mr, Schwarz, Of course that is what Mr, McCone said
when he took over.

Mr. Helms. I understand that. But I-mean we can
roll this over and over and over, but may I just say one
thing. As somebody pointed out in the,newspaper not long
ago, if someone had killed Hitler in 1938 and '39 it might hs
saved the world quite a number of deaths and a very difficule
war and vast expense and all the rest of it. And is it not

possibie that even in the good sense of the citizens of the

United States of America that there are some occasions on

which they seam to think that the Provocation is larger than

-it is on others and that certain actions would be more accept-

able in one climate than thoy would be in another climate,
even though in the strict, interpretation of law and moral
judgment. this might not be the case.

T simply have to rest my ‘cese this way because it seems
to ma history shows this,

Senator Schweiker. How do you know when a Hitler
becomes 4 Hitlor and where do You draw the line when a
Trujillo ought to go or Lumumba ought to Ge, and who makes
that decision?

Mr. Helms. It certainly ought to be made at the top of
the government, Senator Schweiker. rt certainly ought to be
made by political official who are Subject to the will of
the. people and the Congress.

Senator Schweiker. 1 have one more question.

This 18 going ahead a Littie bit, Mr, Ambassador
based on your 25 years of experience, and having seen now
many of the problems that have come to bear for the Agency,
or all intelligence, including not only the assassination prob-
lems but domestic surveillance Problems, and the problem with
Congress and Laos and the war there.

What advice could you give this committee to avoid

areas such an this for the intelligence aqency of the future

TOP SECRET



#0 we do have a strong inteliigence agency doing legitimate
intelligence activities yet not hamstringing it but yet
making sure wome of tha things we have learned the hard
way over these 20-some years don't happen again?

What advice could you give to us te do that?

TOP SECRET



AID ea street, SE metnington, OC

Mx. Helms, Sir, I thin k that I would like to answer
you by saying that obviously ft have given thought to these
matters, I have wondered what it waa that if it had happened
differently through the years might have avoided these various
things.

T have looked at the law, the statute. I think there
are things that should be changed in it and I think it should
be tightened up in certain respects, but I am alec mindful of
the fact that aa long as one is dealing with himan beings,
written words are not going to be the determining factor in
their conduct 24 hours a day seven days of the week, and that
I would hope that in the future what 1s called oversight over

intelligence activitics been given a fuller opportunity,

because I honestly believe that part of the problem through

the years has been that those people who had oversight over
intelligence activities, or particularly the activities of the
CIA, were senior officials both in the Executive and in Congress
who were so busy and so preoccuplied about other matters that
rather short shrift has been given to this activity, and if
there are better oversight or better opportunities to have
extended conversations with members of the Congress, for
example, I think some of these things could be headed off
simply by an indication from a chairman of a committee or
something that this didn't seem to be desirable, or from attic

other Senators.

TOP SECRET



410 Fest Street SC. Wauninaten. 6 20003

For example, let me just take a specific instance.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, when I was leaving,
had a hearing about something having to do with police
departments. It was the-sense of the Committes that this was
an undesirable activity for the Agency to be helping police
departments directly, so they mada & statement to the effect
this should stop. So I believe it was stopped that very day.
There isn’t any desire of these people to go beyond what they

have been told not to do. But if you can't gat ahold of your

oversight committee or they don't have meetings and you are

busy you go ahead doing as beat you can, and I honestly
believe,you know, as I look back in history that Mr. Dulles
would have been very pleased {f he would have had a couple
of Senators by the hand when he went into the Bay of Pigs.
Senator Schweiker. I think you are perfectly right about
oversight. I couldn't agree with you more, And I think here
Congress itself has been derelict, ‘I agree with that. I
think that is a very serious weakness of Congress on the over-
sight committees. The other aspect I think is important, tcc,
and I concede the first point is in many cases when some
oversight was tried to be exercised, and let me say very litt?
was. I don‘t think the intelligence agencies leveled with the
Congress per se, too, and I think that that is a very serious
problem from those who want to say they want to do a good ist

when you don't have that leveling or credibility or whatever

you want to call 4t, how do we.instill that in a system?

Mr. Nelma. I thought that the Agency's record of level-
ing was pretty good whan given the opportunity,

Senator Schweiker, I don't recall ever being before one
of the oversight committees set up by Congress and not
absolutely honestly and fairly answering any question I was
asked.

Senator Schweiker. Now, how about the war in Laos? 1
sat on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, Mr.
Ambassador, and I think Iwas on there for eight years, all
during the war, before CIA owned up to conducting a war in
Laos. And I think Stu Symington, who sat on the Select or on
the Committee on Supervision of CIA made the discovery.

I can't agree with you on Laos because I sat on the

House and Senate Armed Service Committees when you folks came

a number of times and testified and we had to stumble into

it backwards. I think Senator Symington really did it throudh

Foreign Relationa contacts, even though he was on the Oversight

Committee of the Armed Services. I think there is 4 case where

I won't agree with you, even though I agree with what you said
about oversight.

Mr. Helms. I am under oath. Would you mind if I ducked
this? I can give you no answer except to tell the truth and
I would rather not get into it now, if you don't mind, unless

it 1a important to you.

Could I talk to you privately about it if you like?
Senator Schwaiker. Okay.
Senator Baker. (Presiding). Ara there other questions? i
Senator Schweiker. One other question I do hava. In
terms of assassinations, did any membar of Congress know of
any assination attempts? In other words, did the Agency in
the oversight responsibility level with any members of
Congress or oversight committees about asssssinations?

Mr. Helms. I don't know of any conversations about this.

Senator Schwoiker. That is all I have,

Mc. Madigan. Mr. Ambassador, there have been rumors of
resent vintage that the CIA has contributed money to political
campaigns.

Do you know or have any knowledge as to whether --

Mr. Helms. Where is that, sir? What political campaigns’

Madigan, In the United States?

Senator Mathias. Ambassador, You, 1 think explained
very fully and lucidly the way in which you fele you had

a blanket authority without restriction, and that once this

xefresh that authority with each succeeding episode?

Mr. Helma. Yas, I would prefer, Mr. Mathias, to say tha
we were seaing him so regularly that we folt that we were in
tuna with what he desired and what was acceptable.

Senator Mathias. There was an exchange of, if not words,

an-axchange of ideas and feelings that kept the situation
current and continually kept you reassured that there was no
lack, there had been no change of direction at the highest
levels?

Mr. Nelms. Yea sir.

Senator Mathias. That was truo as far as the Castro

situation was concerned?

In other aftuations waa there an exchange of ideas in

this same level of intensity?

Mr. Helms. I don't recall except on Vietnam as many
regular exchanges on any subject as there were on Cuba.- And
to get the attention of the top members of the Government on
a continuing basis on one theme really takes a great deal of
attention to that theme on the part of the White House in
order to generate the fact that the Secretary of State should
attend that meeting rather than that meating on a specific day.
The power of the President flows inte these matters in a stramyr
way and if the Secretary of State appears at an inter-Govern-
mental meeting it {s because he is pretty clear in his mind

that {s where he ought to be that day rather than making a

speech in Chicago or something.

Senator Mathias. How did you manage then under these
difficult circumstancas ~~ I understand exactly what you are
saying -- manage to be. sure that, say, dn the Lumumba situation
or Trujillo situation that there was thia same kind of con-
tinuing policy, or there hadn't begn any change in policy?

Mr. Helms. I don't know the Lumumba situation, I don't
know where the idea came from or.what the policy was any longer
at all, and the Trujillo situation I think that the record
shows an on-going back and forthing between the Agency and
the State Department about the situation in the Dominican
Republic.

Here it seems to me we had a situation Ln which it
stayed in CIA rather than inter-agency committed formally
established dealing with this matter. <i know in there, for
example, Assistant Secretary Rubottom’s name keeps coming
up again and again so I assume the Agency people were dealing
on a continuing basis.

Senator Mathias. Now, after November 22, 1963, when
President Johnson came in, I think your testimony 1s that you
continued to deal with Attorney General Kennedy?

Mr. ilelms, I think for a time we did as long as he was
Attorney Goneral. 1 forget how léng ne stayed there, but 1

Senate, and he said yes, it ia true. So I must have been seein
him up to that time. This is just something that occurred to
me at this moment but I do recall asking him that question.

Senator Mathias. And you continued to deal on these
matters with him although he didn't stand in quite the same
relationship with President Johnson as he obviously had to
President Kennedy?

Mr. Helms. I think on the matter of the Castro business «
it would have been with that Special Group rather than him
particularly, because by thia time that thing had wound down
somewhat. But I think that he was still dnvolved., I think
that isa right.

Senator Mathias. So there isa kind of fluidity about
the whole relationship in all of these matters that is very
alfficult to --

Mr. Helms. Would it he helpful to you if I were to say
over this period of 25 years it has been a very fluid thing,
this busoness of getting clearances and approvals and how
close you are piped in and how close you are not piped in and
oversight and all of these things do change through the years.
It is one of the reasons [ think that the estabiishment of tne
Select Committee 25 years later to look at the intelligence
community is a very baluable, wize thing for our country. |
think a lot of things have to be brought up to date. Tf think

things up in the right places. The intelligence community
so-called has kind of grown like Topsy over the years. Here
was an agency and there was another agency and then you add a
third and then you add a fourth and then tou find some way to
relate them and find aome way to try and coordinate them and
find some way to get Congressional oversight of .them and if you
were to start from absolute scratch and one day say let's set
up an intelligence community you might eet the thing up
entirely differently and maybe more effectively. So the 25
years later I think it is just fine that this Committe has
seized this problem. It is very difficult one and I don't
believe by circling you are going to find many easy answers
but it is certainly an effort worth making-on behalf of our
country. After all, two things. Intelligence is the first
line of defense hy good effective intelligence organizations,
but it has to be good, there is no sense in having an inteLli-
gence organization like the German one during World War II,
which was no good. That does you more harm than good. I
don't mean to keep saying that word. The other thing is that
in the arranging of the intelligence community, the oatablish-
ment of some kind of an organization which was set up after
Pearl Harbor and designated the CIA to get material From all
over the Government and qive balanced judgments not subject to

political or departmental pressures, as to what they believe th-

Union is is vary important because if that function falls into i
the hands of the self-servers there wouldn't be enough money ini
the world to support our military establishment,

Senator Mathias. I think that is a very helpful and
useful comment.

I think we understand that by whatever means, by whatever
form of human communication was involved that original
authorizations were given even at various times for given
Projects. The projects may have altered. [ think tho
teatimony, not only your testimony but Mr. Blasell's and others
has been that a project undertaken to remove somebody in a
political sense might become later a project to remove that
same person in a physical sense. So the projects did alter.

But, a1] pursuant to the original authorization, do you
think that there was adequate political control as this kind
of undulation took place, that a President or a President's
designee, for example, sufficiently aware of the undulations
and had an opportunity to veto the action at some point, at
sone critical point?

Mr. Nelms. I think that the basic thrust of what you ara
saying is quite accurate, As a long time, I might put it this
way, bureaucrat, it seems to me one of the qreat problems of
Government is that one starts something it takes on a life of
its own, then it gets turned off far too late, and I have been

guilty of this in my own work, 1 know this, but it is alno

true of departments of Government, And if the Senate, for
example, every year had put before it a list of all the things i
that it had sot up the year before, I venture to gay there :
might be a percentage of them you would like to get rid of a
year later or five years later, but they continue going on and
getting budgeted and employing people and so forth and nobody
gets around to stopping them,

Senator Mathias. We have a snuff box on the floor of
the Senate. It is filled everyday.

Lat me ask off the record.

{off the record discussion}

Senator Schweiker. I have ona question. Mr. Ambassador,
had the CIA, to your knowledge, ever used Peace Corps or Peace
Corps membera as either direct assistants in any way to our
overseas intelligence activities?

Mr. Helms. No sir. I say no sir emphatically because
I remember in this case specifically writing a paper making
it clear to everybody that was involved in the clandestine

side of the CIA the Peace Corps was not to be used because

Sargeant Shriver when he was head of the Peaco Corpr went to

Preaident Kennedy one day and charged that we wore using the
Peace Corps for cover. And I went into prove that Mr. Shriver
was wrong and’ as a result of this 1 seid there is only one
way to be absolutely certain and that is for me to ban this,

Senator Schweiker, Can you ahed any Light -~ I think our
Peace Corps people were thrown cut of Ceylon with the Bllegatian
that they were helping the CIA?

Mr. Helms This was a KGD political or psychological war-
fare rather, At that time for years, even very shortly after
the Peace Corps began, that the Soviet propaganda kept
asserting that it was CIA that was under the Peace Corps, it
was CIA, that was in the Arab press and Ariatic press and
African press, and I would assume the Ceylonese press. It «
exactly the same, it was Communist propaganda.

Senator Schweiker, There 18 a written memorandum or

Mr. Melms. It goes back to the early days of the found-
ing of the Peace Corps.
