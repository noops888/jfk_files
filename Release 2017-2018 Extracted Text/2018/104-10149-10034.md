Dear Bob:

Herewith are comments on the new version of the Defector

paper and the Cuban paper.

These comments were prepared in my

absence by those on whom I have leaned during this phase of the

inquiry,

I note the

"Mongoose" reference, a basic factual comment.

I also note the "golden boy" reference. Someona may have referred

to the man that way, but it was not a categorization in general use.

Mukes interesting reading but is more literary than reliable, ror

the impression it conveys. Further, it indicates a tie we feel

should be protected.

Sincerely,

S. D. Breckinridge

Principal Coordinator, HSCA
