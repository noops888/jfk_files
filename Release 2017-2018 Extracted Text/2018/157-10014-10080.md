which occurred nearly fifteen years ago, fome fifteen years,
some slightly more, some slightly less. So therefore, I will
make every effort, but again, I am stressing this fact that t

Mr, Baron. That is completely understandable.

Mr. Hedqman. I just want this -- I am making this point
for the Committes members. I have already made it to you
yesterday.

where I then became ovart in the sanse of I worked in the
offices and was no longer ostensibly a private businessman.
I served as what is known as & case officer in the European
area.

Mr. faron. About what time period would you say?

Mr. Hedgman. It was '53 to early ‘57. Early ‘67 untit
the mid-60's I served in Europe working primarily on Soviet
operations.

Mr. Dawson. I think you might have misapoken. You sald
mid-60's, early 157 to mid-60's, Did you mean 1960?

Mr. Hadgman. Mid-1969, yes, T would correct that, From
July 6 on until -- I can't remember whether {t was June oF
July of 1963 i served as Chief of Station in then Laopoldvillie,
now Xiershasa, Zaire. I was Chisf of Station. I then returned
to Washington in the early fall, the exact dates I don’t recall,
of 1963, and I was what is known as a Branch chief. I was
responsible for tha eastern half of Africa From 1963 to June

of 1965.

I returned to Washington whera I became Branch chief

again for the Southeast Asian area for a vary prief tima, In

essence it was to prepara me for my next assignment which was

the Chief of Station, Vientiane, Laos.

unfortunately forcing me to leave.

Mr. Hedgman. Tshombe had already declared the Katanga

Mr. Wides. Do you recall indicating to us yesterday
thet when he arrived initially one thought you had was that
perhaps you were going to be replaced as Station chief, in your
first job as Station Chief, because you had been dragging your
feat, or not acting expeditiously anough on Lumumba?

Mr. Nedqman. 1 recall saying that yesterday.

‘Mc. Wides. What is your recollaction today?

Mr. Wadqman. Put it -- may T go off the racord a moment? :

Mr. Wides. Yes.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Hides. Let's go back on the record.

Let iy phrase the question this way, Mr. Hedgman: when
Mr. O'Donnell arrived, I take it as 4 somewhat junior station
Chief, and in your first joh as a Statton Chief, that you

considerad whether there was dissatisfaction with your handling j

lof the job, or the need for more experienced personnel there,

is that correct?
Mr. Hedgman. T think that {s possibly true.

Mr. Wides. Now, do you recall whether ona of the

thoughts that went through your mind was that parhaps the

. 1
Headquarters was, the Agency waa dissatisfied with foot-draqains’

or the lack of action on your part in smplanent ina for ceteten tf

Mr. Hedgman. T cannot say that with certainty now. Tt
is very possible,

Hr. Wides. Do you have any recollection that that went
through your mind even if you can't be certain?

Mr. iedgman. To repeat, that ha ~~

Mr. Wides. That you thought ~~

Mr. Hedgman. That I thought thet they were dissatisfied
with my handling of that?

Mr. Wides. Because you had not yet eliminated Lumumba
or taken further steps to do so?

Me. Medgman. I just can't, 1 just would Like to back off
that one because I cannot be certain. I knew that obviously
they had sent a man who had much more experiance than t, and
yet it was clear that he was working - for me, because { was
, not relievad as Chief of Station. They would never have sent
him there under me and then switched the positions.

Me, Wides, Prior to his coming -- to return now to the
period when you sent the confirmation, request for confirmation

do you recall slugging it back through 4 particular channel?

Mr. Nedgman. ‘There was some special channal, and T ~~

im a double-talk way that even the communicator would not

Mr, Wides. If your communication to the Headquarters and
| their communication back ware in somewhat ambiquous terms,
particularly your question, such as is the Person, ie this
person the Messenger, and are hie instructions accurate, énd
Af the reply was essentially yes to both questions, how would
that have asgured you that his invocation of Presidential
