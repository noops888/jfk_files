the Ambassador returned to America?

Mr. lodgman. That's corract.

did you have any discusalong or learn of any diacussions

Mr. Hedgman. Yes.

-

that 1s by the 5ch of Geh, Patrica Lumumba had been dismissed

as Premier and the U.S. had already bacome serlously concerned

about the beginning of soviet assistance or involvement in the

Congo and the possibility of Soviet Influence in the Congo?

Mr. Hlodgman.. and contained Instructions that I was not!

Maybe we could approach that a differant way.

You do recall whataver

message you recalved was not in the normal

course of communications with the Agency?

Mt. ledgman. Well, 1t came through Agancy communications

channala, but it -- it was marked Fyes Only, for'me.

MI, Dawson. That's not unusual, necessarily?

Mr. Hedgman. At that time it was more unusual than it is

today, I would say.

that would work. But as the Chief of Station, I still, aven

Mr. Widas. If not that specific ..

of the Agency?

Mr. lledgman. I have trlad to go back in my mind on that.

assassinate Lumumbo in a way which would not inplicate tha

Mt. Hedgman. I would quality that slightly. I would

:

considerad whether there was dissatisfaction with your handling i

Hof the job, or the nood for more exporienced personnel there,

is that correct?

1s very poasible.

Mr. lodgman. To rapeat, that he -

MI. Wides. That you thought

with my handling of that?

or taken further stapo to do go?

I Just can't, I just would Ilke to back off

that one because I cannot be certain. I knew that obviously

they had sent a man who had much more experiance than I, and

yet it was clear that ho was working. for me, bacause I way

that have assured you that his invocation of Prosidential

more naive then

Instructions?

Mr. ladgman. I couldn't speculate as to whother he thought

I would or not.

Mr. Widas. But would that have boon a falr impression

for him to take away from your comments?

Mr. ledgman. I think it would be a falr impression that

he would take away the thought that. I was going to look into

it and try and figuro if thore was a way, but I do remember --

I shouldn't

the President wanted this, would lt have been fair for him to

carry away from your convargation the understanding that if

you thought it could be done, if you found a way, that it would

Mr. Hedyman. Yes.

MI, Widas.

The potential problems, and you had gotten

the unusual communication, a direct personal messanger, that

the Presidont of the Unitad Statas had instructed the Agency

to aliminate Lumumba?

Mr. Hedgman.

Right.

Mr. Wides. Now, I find it a littla hard to understand

of other roguirements which ware laviad on me which we are not

dlacussing and la not in the purview of this discussion today.

I think thare was one major thing probably which took some of

the heat off, that is, that Lumumba had been assentially

nautralizad within his offica complex, home and office complex

7

I'e was able to sand messages out, but the - there had

been a coup d'otat, at least. there was a coup d'ata on tha

9

night of the 14th of September, 1960. A government which was,

10

although nationalistically oriented seemed relativaly friendly

11

toward the United Statos, was in powar. There was a great deal

of discussion as to its legality at cho time, but that was

13

resolved by the Unitod States and most of the Western powers

who decided that it was legal since the government, since once

Mr. Wides, Doas' the crypt JMOGRE mean anything to you?

Mr. ledgman. No, sir.

Mr. Wides.

Do you recall a time when Mr. O'Donnell had

an agent come into the Congo to assist him in his efforts?

Mi. lodgman. I had not rememberad that until yesterday

when you raised it.

Mí. Widos. Do you now have a racollaction, refreshed, of

his having someone come in?

Mr. llodgman.

A vague

recollection, very vague.

Mr. Wides. Do you rocall whare the porson came from, or

whether ho was a CIA officer, or just a contract agent?

Mr. ledgman. From

the name you used for him yesterday.

I would know that he would be an agent as opposed to an

intelligence officer.

Mr. Wides.

But you have no indepandent recollection of

who he was of where he was from or his background?

ME. Hedgman.

No. I had forgotten that entirely.

!!

Mr. Wides. Do you recall a time when you learned that

Patrico Lumumba had escaped from his house detention or arrest.

.1 n

tha Presidontial Palace?

MI. lludgnan. Yes. It was not the Palace, the Prime

Miniater's rosidence.

Mr. Wideo. The Prime Minister's residence.

And do you rocall whether you had any foreknowledge that.

that was imminant, or a likely possibility?

Mt. Wides. Do you know of any assistance or involvement

of 'Ms, O'Donnell'or his agent or anyone eino connected with the

Station in Mr. Lumumba's escape from the detention?

Mr. lodgman. I am quite cartain that there was no Agency

involvament in any way, bacause I think I would -- I am convinced

I would have known it as Chlaf of Station.

O'Donnell could not have taken auch action under normal

Agency procedures without consulting me.

MI. Wides. Now, is it correct that when he escaped, Mr.

Lumunba tried to journey to the Stanleyville region where his

following was the strongest, and that along the way, en route,

ho was apprehended by the Contral Congoless government authori-

ties and brought back under arrest, first to Leopoldville,

is that correct?

Mr. lledgman. That's correct.

But you would not charactarize your activities

as providing any assistance

to the congolose to locato him, or

would you?

Mr. Hudgman. I honestly, I don't think it - if it was

any assistance, certainly

not a major assistance.

Mr. Hides. Do you racall any communication wich the

the sort of thing I suppose that the congolose officials really

ranted to discuss with

a represantative of a foreign government.

Mr. Hides. Has

Base Chief in the Katanga Province and the officlals In Katanga?

Has there any discusalon batwoen them or communication that you

know of regarding what would bo done with Patrica Lumumba?

Mr. lladgman, I would like to pick up hare

for a moment with a series of short, loose ends from the

axamination that we have done so

far.

Mr. lladgman. I will try to do my best.

Mr. Baron. That is, first of all, whon you discused

your conversation with the then DCl, Schlesingor, you said that

you indicatod to him verbally that you had bean asked to

participate

in an assagaination of Patrico Lumumba. Did he

respond when you made that indication

to him?

Mr. lledgman.

May I go back? I think i mada it to him.

It is concalvable that. I could have made it to Bill Colby as

his Executive Director, or that tho

two could have been present

together. It is ridiculous, but i cast pin thie one down in

detail.

Mr. Baron. Did you recolve a responga from Schlesinger?

You mentioned yesterday that he was able to ba quito sphinxlike

whan he wanted to, and you thought that this miht have been

one of those situations.

Ar. Hadaman.

I had the impression he took lt all on board

and did not necessarily wish to advise me of what action he

planned to take.

HI. Baron. Has there any follow-up?

sensitive oparation like that one?

Mr. liedgman. Well, it is standard procedure to keap your

cable files and all other files as small as possible, because

copies of those are rotainud, of all massages are normally

ratained in Washington.

You try and keep as small a number as

possible on hand so as to permit you to continue working so that;

you have ready raference, because you may have to, in an

And balisva me,, when you have to yo through a burn

- Mr. Hodgman. No, I don't think so. I don't recall doing

was a highly sonsitiva ared in which - at one parlod i recall

we had all of our filos in the burn barrels. I mean, when you

wanted a file, you went over and dug it out of the burn barrel.

Mr. Baron. But the cablo traffic ralating to the

assassination mission wasn't destroyad as a routine matter

because

it was excoss traffic, but because of lta extranely
