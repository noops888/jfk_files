1, AS we both know the Whitehouse case has been kicked around
sufficiently that the finalizing of the case should be effected as
Soor as possible, My:-trip with to office,

point of.view was, if the man was due-the money pay him. If he was not.
due the monéy, don’t pay him. I will give you ‘the facts as I see them
and if you-feel that it is prudent to ‘seek the advice of Jack Anderson
for’ his opinion I'm sure it wll be most helpful.
