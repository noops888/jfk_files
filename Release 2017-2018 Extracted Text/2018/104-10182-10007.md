D. IdanE - Has the pilot who cracked up the other Colo, plus

he was unwilling to fly at night.

I gave him l hours of afr time

and recormended he be used only as a compilut on groinda of poor

head work.

Iden E - He la an nider pilot who would bounce the airplane

and then sit there waiting for lt to hit again, without adding power

to let it doin easy.

He also wanted to feather the vrong engine

after one was cut.

Recumminded he only be used as a compilot.

he would not come within 200 of aseigied heading tume at the begining.

terminated.

Iden E Mis wan had previous C-46 experience of about 2000

He sloved great interest and did a good job fro the beginning.

I recommanded he be used as PIC in Ci46's.

Iden F- This man was suppose to have had a good deal of

•experience.

but hie flying left very mich to be desired.. He had

just been convalescering from amebic dysentery. He replied when:

shed, that he felt up to flying but his performance was very poor.

He deetded he still didn't feel up to flying and retured to the

doctor!s care..

Iden. G- Had previous multiengine experience and co-pilot

time in the B-26'e.

He progressed satisfactory and with 7+20 hours

was released to the field to fly in right seat

to observe tactica

and gain more experience before moving to leît seat as PIC.

h. Iden ! - Had lintted experience, horever, he ras very inter

eated and applied himself to the task of checking out in the B-26k.

He was very belpful in reproducing power limitationg and sumer sotting

for the Cbait-1?

series engine and also reproduced the Pal pamphiet

un the CB-it-li series engines, which I had urought along ca a train

This was made required reading material for all B-26 drivers.

This man rude along at an observer while Iden G. was being trained,

which aided hin when he started fiying.
