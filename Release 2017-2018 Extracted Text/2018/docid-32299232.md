Organization of American States (0.A.S.) will be asked
to send observers.

"Two groups, a coalition of leftist and
conservative Haitians led by former President Daniel Fignole
and former Sen. Lluis de Joie, and a conservative organization
led by Pierre Rigaud, have not joined the unity movement."

On September 20, 1963, SJ T-2, a Haitian national
residing in Puerto Rico, who is in a position to know certain
aspects of Haitian activity in Puerto Rico, advised as
follows:

On September 15, 1963, the JURE held its first
annual celebration at Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, on
September 15, 1963. At this meeting it was announced
that a pact of mutual assistance had been recently signed
between the JURE and FUL. This pact, entitled "To Public
Opinion of the Free World", consists of denunciations of
the current Cuban and Haitian dictatorships, branding them
as Communist. The last paragraph of this pact indicates
that the JURE and FUL agree that should one or the C
other, Cuban or Haitian, governments fall, the other
will consider the fight for the other's independence as
an "extension" of their fight for liberation and lend all
help possible to bring about the overthrow of the existing
dictatorship.

: SJ T-2 advised that the only Haitian group known
to be presently operating in Puerto Rico is the FUL which
was organized on August 12, 1963. The membership of this
organization at present consists of three persons, namely
GEORGES LACOMBE, FREDRIC BESSON, and RAYMOND CHAMPANA, all
Haitians residing in Puerto Rico. BESSON and CHAMPANA have
not been active in the FUL nor have they indicated any
desire to do so.
