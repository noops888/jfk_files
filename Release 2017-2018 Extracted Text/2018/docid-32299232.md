permanent resident card #A12 451 227, which showed he

entered the United States at Miami, Florida on 10/21/62

on a 0-1 visa.

He was born 1/1/31. He resided in Cuba

from 1959 to 1962 when he came to the United States:

Member of The FuNs Malicade eliberacion

Maitian.d

LACOMBE stated

there are many Haitians

residing in Cuba and that during his residence there he

and many other Haitians tried to interest the Cuban

Government in helping to overthrow the DUVALIER Government

in Haiti, but their efforts were to no avail.

He stated

that as

It became increasingly evident that FIDEL CASTRO of

Cuba was Communist he attempted to leave Cuba and finally

succeeded in October, 1962.

LACOMBE stated the FUL has no funds with which

to operate and has no membership other than in Puerto

Rico.

he stated that PAUL VERNA, a Haitian residing

in the Dominican Republic,

is not a member of the FUL

but is interested in the overthrow of President DUVALIER

of Haiti; therefore, willing to lend his support to

any group furthering this cause.

During the interview

with LACOMBE it appeared

he is an opportunist and that the FUL is a "paper

organization".

As he pointed out, the number of Haitians

in Puerto Rico limits any Haitian group attempting to

establish itself in Puerto Rico.

During a previous

Interview with JOSE ERNESTO MUZAURIETA, (SJ T-1), he

stated that he had originally hired LACOMBE as a supervisor

but as a result of his poor work he reduced him to the

money to support himself.
