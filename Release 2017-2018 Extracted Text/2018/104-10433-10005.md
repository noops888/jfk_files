Disposition - This document was denied. The document is a memo

which recites the speculative thinking of an Agency officer on the assassination:

of President Kennedy. The paper deals with a possible explanation of the

assassination. He treats the problem experimentally with a thesis which is

not born out by facts available then or later developed. The thinking

expressed was imaginative but not definitive.. No decision was based on

this paper: It appears clearly to be the type of documents contemplated for

"I. I desire that you consider these reactions to the Kennedy

assassination:

=.

Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio statements

as heard in London attributed the assassination to "right

wing elements." Only as the true identity of the believed

assassin became known did Moscow begin to complain that

U.S. reactionaries were using Oswald as a pawn.

b. Should not the assigment of I3th Dept. OffiCers to the KEB

residency in the United Nations in New York be considered

c.. (I discovered from

during our long

and exceptionally valuable discussions, that one of Harold

Wilson's principal scientific advisors 1s Captain Ian Maxwell,

who has a long Soviet Intelligence background.

shed new light on AFLADLE's report LI.e., that Harold Wilson

may be & soviet agent?

2. Putting it baldly, was Oswald, unwittingly or wittingly, part of

a plot to murder President Kennedy In Dallas as an attempt to

further exacerbate sectional strife and render the U.S. Government

capable of dealing with Soviet initiatives over the next

year? If AELADLE's views on Wilson and the information noted in

paragraph lc above have any substance (and they cannot be ignored)

this suggests that we can expect major Soviet pressures over the

next seyeral months, for which the Soviets have made careful,

Jong-range preparations."

The above reference to 13th Dept. officers in New York refers to the

presence, reported by an FBI penetration of the KGB locally, In New York or

Washington of one or two known officers of the 13th Department of the Ist Chief

Directorate (Foreign Intelligence) of the KGB.

This department is charged with

"liquid affairs," sabotage and assassination.

oy the way, met clandestinely with a Soviet "exchange student" from a

Pennsylvania university during the school year 1962-63, which suggests that

the Soviet student 1s also a 13th Dept. officer or agent. Perhaps

significantly, his course of studies was in food chemistry!
