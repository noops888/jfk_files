L Dispesition — ‘This document was denied. -The document isa, ‘memo,

-which recites the speculative thinking of an Agency officer on the assassinatioti :

of President Kennedy. The paper deals.with a possible explanation of the
assassination. He treats the problem experimentally with’a thesis which is .
not bor out by facts available then or later developed. The thinking
expressed was imaginative but not definitive. No decision was based on
this paper ;” It appears clearly to be the type of documents contemplated for

exemption undeg_subsec! (5). The document also relates information *
received from service. It contains information from and
about a sensitiv@source., THE document also identifies Agency officers and

From: args,
Subject: % on{Chief, SR Division, re Possible KGB role

1. the following is the(text of a cable from Chief, SR Division, sent
oe closed. tnsletons) from Fre at 23162) on 23 November, for the attention

"1. I desire that you consider these reactions to the Kennedy
assassination:

8. Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio statements
fas heard in London attributed the assassination ta “right~
ing elements." as the true identity of the believed
assassin became known did Moscow begin to complain that
U.S. reactionaries were using Oswald as a pawn.

b (sou not the assignment of 13th Dept. officers to the KGB
sidency in United Nations in New York be considered

in a new light?)
c. (¢ stscoversa during our long
G ssscoracet 2s seassions; that one of Harold

Wilson's principal selentific advisors 1s Captain Ian Maxwell
u who has a long Soviet intelligence background. This may
shed new light on AELADIE's report /I.e., that Herold iileon
be a Soviet agent) 5

2. Costing it baldly, was Oswald, unwittingly or wittingly, part *)
‘a plot to murder President Kennedy in Dallas as an attempt to
further exacerbate sectional. strife and render tue U.S. oe)
less capable of dealing with Soviet initiatives over the next

(a ABLADLE's views on Wilson and the information noted im
jparagrabh le above have any substance (and they cannot be ignored)
this suggests that we can expect major Soviet pressures over the
next several months, for which the Soviets have made careful,
long-range preparations..Y

2. Exe above reférence to 13th Dept. officers in New York refers tothe
foresence, reported by an FBI penetration of the KGB locally, in New York or
Washington of one or two known officers of the 13th Department of the lst Chief
Directorate (Foreign Intelligence) of the KGB. This department is charged with
"liquid affairs," sabotage and assassination. of the 13th cers,

y the way, met clandestinely with a Soviet "exchenge student" from a
Penneylvanie university during the school year 1962-63, which suggests that |
the Soviet student 1e also a 13th Dept. officer or agent. Perhaps
significantly, his course of studies vas in food chemistry! |
3. \ you will note that Mr. Marphy's comments come without benefit 3)
traces we passed to you earlier today, showing that Oswald had contact, |
th a 13th Dept. representative in Mexico City.

4, (another recently-arrived cable, being sent to the Director tonight, |
feuggests that Oswald's business with the Soviet Consul was comected with his |
own vies to the USSR and Cuba (in transit) and may, therefore, have been |
really rather then ostensibly innocent. |
