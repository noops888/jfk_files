- Despite a 2S-year period of no ex-

change of information between the U.S.

und China, a vast amount of detailed

data has been accumulated, all indi

itself after the turmoil of 1966. Since

1969 over 2,000 types of Chincse tra-

ditional and Western medicines have

The Autumn Canton Trade Fas

trends in China. Among the charges

noted were the 30 per cent increase in

customers and the Chinese favorism

The revolution in Chinese education

has produced many schools such as

This has prompted shifting of some

hospitals from large metropolitan cen

it is reported, has set up a so-called
