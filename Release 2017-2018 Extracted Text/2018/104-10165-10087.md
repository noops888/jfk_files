data bas brea accumulated, all in
eating that China has again stabilized
itself after the turmoil of 1966. Since

1969 over 2,000 types of Chinese tra-

The Avtume Centon Treds F
recently gave some indication of the
tends in China. Among the changes
noted were the 30 per cent increase in
customers and the Chinese favoritism
fer West European countries, especially
France and Italy, at Japan's expense.
Exhibits at the fair reflected numerous
technological advances over the pr-
vious year. Among the displays were
silicon-controlied automatic electronic
and punch-tape-controll2d tools, meas
uring and testing instruments, oseillo-
scopes, microscopes, and a wide range
of synthetic plastics, resins and such
basic drugs as antibiotics, sulphur
rugs and vitamins.

‘The revolution in Chinese education
kas produced many schools such as
the Shantong University of Science
ead Technology in Tsinan which
pened Jast October.

iL Curing the “incurable

Other reports point out that the
‘integration of western medicine and
“(Chinese traditional medicine has re-
‘sulted in successful treatment of many
commen and recurrent diseases as well
; curing some of the “incurable”

diseases such as osteomatosis, epilepsy

“herbs me being used to preven and
‘treat diseases and heal injucies is
sweeping the country, according to
# eeports. Several instances of rejoining
fevered limbs to the body by using
cherbal
part of

rugs have been described. As

7 this broad movement “red.
medical counters” have been set up in

ries and illnesses and recur-
ting discases by several methods in-
eluding acepuncture and injections.

To scsist in the struzsc against
disease a new type of dizdynamic
current stimulator used back
strains, sprains and neuralgia has
been developed. Transistors substitute
for electronic tubes and ordinary dry
batteries for alternating current, the
stimulator no larger than a book. A
transistor device with a freezing micro-
tome and a unit for cryotherapy has
been developed, lessening the time for
making thin sections for rapid biopsy
inspections and used in the treatment
of skin diseases and svzgical pro-
cedures in dealing with wasis and tiny
vascular tumors.

Popultion Control

Shanghai recently has been the scene
of posters urging young people to
marry Jater_ in life, prompidg ob-
servers to believe the Chinese are
taking serious note of the pezulation
increase. At a Tokyo family planning
conference recently it was reported
that the mainland vrtan birth,
Fate was down. If this is true, it is the
result of a 15-year birth control cam-
paign. Through a combination of
contraception, abortion, sterilization
and encouragement of the late mar-
riages, China is said to have almost
hated its earlier population growth:
