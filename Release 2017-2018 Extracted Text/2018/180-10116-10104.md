GH chairman downing. The committee will come to order.
Mr. Sprague, the next time we have one of these
executive meetings, Mr. McKinney made what I think is an
excellent suggestion + that when we go into executive session
we find some suitable room that we can adjourn to, to carry on

the executive session, and we won't have this delay.

Mr. Sprague. Mr. Chairman, I think it would be a great
idea to try to have an alternate room to move to.

Chairman Downing. Now, will everybody in the room not
a member of this committee staff identify themselves?

Mr. Hutton. E. M. Hutton, the gnairman's staff.

Mr. Levin. Jay B. Levin, Congressman Dodd's staff.

Ms. Caldwell. Bonnie Caldwell, Congressman Gonzalez'
staff.

Mr. Burgess. Quentin Burgess from Congresswoman Yvonne
Burke's office.
Mr. Harvey. Percy Harvey, from Congressman Ford's state:

Wye STATEMENT OF RICHARD A. SPRAGUE, CHIEF COUNSEL AND
DIRECTOR

yx. Spague- Mr. Chairman, before I commence that, may
II bring up two other matters, first, on which I would like
to.get some direction from the committee.

As I understand it, there is going to be another: meeting

of this committee for purposes of presentation of the report

that will be submitted to the Congress, this Congress.

..Chairman Downing... That meeting will be next Friday,..at

10 588 a.m., that is the 17th of December, ata place to be
decided. :

Mr. McKinney. Mr. Chairman, could we have it at.

L690 o'clock? Would anybody object? Is it going to be zs long
meeting?

Mr. Sprague. I would not think so.

Mr. McKinney. I find myself in an embarrassing position $
being tanking member of the Economic Stabilization ¢ Commitee,
Bill Moorhead has moved the steel price meetings three
times to accommodate the Minority side of the aisle.

Chairman Downing. I certainly have no objection to
Leto o'clock. Anybody else?

The committee will then meet at 1868 o'clock. That is

Friday, December 17.

Mr. Sprague. What I would like to bring to the

attention of the committee, if I may, there is a question:

| NW°50955° Docld:34p66459 (Page 5
a ge


eras

in my mind, as your chief counsel, with regard to the present
‘resolution that exists concerning the authbity as the base
for this committee to operate on. There is in my opinion

a grave question of constitutionality, not with regard to

the ability of the Congress to be investigating, but with
regard to the way in which the resolution that presently
exists is worded.

QR vvankty, because of that, I have seen that no subjpena
was issued that was other than what I call a friendly
subjpena, because I did not want to get in the posture where
someone was attacking it, and taking us into court on the
constitutional ase that exists.

And a. seeking guidance on a7 I would like to
be able to preGent to the committee, at the next session,
a sort of prédible to the resolution stating what I submit
would-be the appropriate basis for this investigation, so that
‘ie and when the matter of the constitutionality arises, we
are properly and fully bottomed. But I would not do that unless|
given such direction by the committee.
Chairman Downing. Well, I think if any question exists
in your mind as to the constitutionality of the section of
the resolution, certainly you should draft a preamble, along wit

a.proposed resolution, which will, of course, have to be

submitted in the next session of Congress.

Mr. Sprague. At the next session I would like ‘to present

NW 50955. Doctd:3dbees59 Page 6:



23
24

25

378
what I think will be a preamble there which I think would
then save this resolution, the wording of it, from subsequent
attack.

Gi Mr. Thone. Does this come down to whether or not that

resolution directs itself. enough to

a legislative purpose?

Mr. Sprague. Legislative and oversight purposes, because
r think there would be problems the way it is presently
worded.

Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Chairman, let me give you a little
history, because this is something that bothered he ae
the very beginning. .

The wording that finally resulted in this resolution
was very hastily prepared, presented to me by the flerk of
the Rules Committee. I raised the point immediately, and he
said, "This is what I have been ordered to arrange.
Do you have any suggestions?"

Well, there was one sentence that I knew was at first
blush violative a “So scratch that out." And I said,
"The rest I have my doubts, but my gosh, you want this in
today, so you can have something to meet on tomorrow." And that
is the way it got submitted.

Now, I didn't ask him what the history of the drafting
had been when he presented it. But since then, I, have been

going into that. And I for one would be very grateful if you

NW-50955 Docld:32%66459° Page 7



HW 50955 Decta:3

would, because we may wish to think of the procedure we

may want to follow on in January.
G This was a simple House resolution. We may wish
to file another for the sake of having immediate full House
consideration, so as to not lose too much time. And in that
respect, I am trying toget the picture from the Parliamentarian.
So I for one would be very grateful if you would, and we
could look it over next week.
Chairman Downing. Without objection, counsel is
z eg
directed to draft a preamble and/or a resolution for presenta-
tion at the next meeting of the committee.
Mr. McKinney. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Dodd could not
be here today, because he had to go back to Connecticut.
-He asked me if I would make sure the counsel. :piea@se keep in
retained the eption
the wording which basiesthemavasicbalniisktes of looking into the othe:

assassinations. He is not suggesting we should, but he feels

perhaps we might want to esmamcemmikeees at least put

a protective hold on materials pertaining to other political
assassinations.

Mr. Sprague. Mr. Dodd so advised me. And the other |
matter that I would want to bring to the attention of. the
committee + although we are reviewing it oa there has been
a letter submitted by the Civil Liberties Union in Chicago
requesting that we look into what they allege is the assassina-

tion of two people of the Black Panthers.

Gh Mr. Anderson. Is that the Fred Hampton case?

Mr. Sprague. Yes, it is, sir. We are in the process of
at least looking that material over. And if I may at the
next session I will at least prepare a summarization
with a recommendation to the committee.

Chairman Downing. All right. That will be fine.

Mr. Sprague. The next housekeeping chore that I
just want to bring to the attention of the committee is this:
It has been suggested that assuming this investigation
proceeds, and that there are hearings, that they are on oes
a historical note that either we arrange for a videotaping
of them, just the keeping of them as a permanent record,
or make arrangements with the news media, who undoubtedly

will be televising them, for obtaining their records. : wee

thoughts are on that.

Chairman Downing. Are you talking about‘a videotaping
Greate entire session?

Mr. Sprague. Of what is our public hearings, where ©
witnesses are presented.

Chairman Downing. All right.

Mr. Sprague. I.am not making any recommendation. . I

Chairman Downing. That is not a matter we have to resolve

right now. All right.

DT e- Sprague. Mr. Chairman, with regard to the investiga-
o) 2 || tion in more detail than we have gone into, I would start with
3 the Kennedy assassination.
} ‘ 4 It has come to our attention that in the area of the
5 finding of the bullet which allegedly went through President
6 || Kennedy and through Governor Connally, the following situation
7 || at. least had existed:
8 The bullet was found on a stretcher in the Parkland

GQ An elevator operator, called an engineer, was given the
assignment of operating that elevator on this particular day.
That operator took the stretcher of Governor Connally which
is said somebody had wheeled back there to the elevator after
Governor Connally had been taken to the second floor sf the
stretcher was brought back to the elevator.’ That operator
said he then took the elevator with the stretcher down to: the
basement floor where President Kennedy's stretcher was ‘against
the wall, and the operator said he took the Connally stretcher,
wheeled -it out and placed it next to the Kennedy stretcher.
So you had, as he testified, the Kennedy stretcher next: to
the’ wall, outwardly of the Governor Connally stretcher.. That
witness testified before the Warren Commission and he testi-
fied that the bullet. he found, which was the bullet. that was
at least alleged to be this. one bullet - I think you Soe
ber the pictures in-terms'of the condition of that bullet a
allegedly went through President Kennedy and Governor Connally.
That bullet this witness said he found on the stretcher that

was next to the wall which would be President Kennedy's

| stretcher, and there were bloody sheets there. He so testi-

fied before the Warren Commission.
Obviously if that testimony in fact is true, it does cre-

ate a problem as to how this bullet which allegedly went. from

‘Kennedy to Connally ends up on President Kennedy's stretcher:

Gea conclusion that, yes, he did find this bullet, but
he was mistaken as to which stretcher he found it on. He
drew that conclusion because in the questioning of that wit-
ness they describe these stretchers as #eretcher A, gtretcher
B and perhaps could Stretcher B have been in a certain posi-
tion and the testimony was generally presented.

Gor reading of it is there is an indication of the wit-
elie ariel confused. In. any event, the witness ended up
saying he was not sure on which stretcher it was found ana
there are other people who said the mass of bloody sheets =
‘were not on the Kennedy eeeecnes against the wall but on
the Connally stretcher outwards, so the Warren Commission con-
cluded this bullet had to be found on the Connally stretcher.

I say this because obviously the question as to what
bullet where, whose stretcher could be of some Gipee dance:

A nurse came forward and told us that she was a student
nurse there on that particular day along with another person
she named as well, and she relates how they had been in the
firauma Zoon No. 1 with President Kennedy and then coming out
in the hallway to go up this elevator upstairs at point
after Governor Connally had been wheeled out of. Trauma Room
No. 2.

ever been questioned by anybody from the day of the event
until this young lady came forth to us.

Ff ex explanation 4 I did ask her, "What is it that moti-
vated you to come forth to us after 13 years?" + her response
x and we have talked to her directly, I have as well, and
‘there is nothing kooky about this person oe is she frankly
thought initially some agency of law enforcement would get
to her at some point because she is on the record as working
that day; there is nothing secret, and in the course of
time when nobody did she just kind of felt that guilt that
she hadn't said anything,. and that has bothered her ever since.

In any event what she relates to us is important from
two standpoints, in our review of the thoroughness of the in-
vestigative effort that existed previously, it is certainly
I would say surprising that since the importance of that one
bullet and where it was found becomes such an issue ~ it
was an issue even back then 4 there would not have been one
effort to find out each and every person that was present at
the hospital who perhaps saw this and interview them for
whatever they would say. It does raise some question in terms
of thoroughness in the rush to get the prior investigation
done.

She relates as she came down the hallway with her stu-
“dent nurse friend to go to the elevator there was at that

time only one stretcher, and that was the stretcher next: to

the wall. Whether this means that Governor Connally's stretcher
had not yet been brought back or there was a later period in
time we are in the course of investigating, but she relates

that the one stretcher that was there with bloody sheets on
that stretcher was the stretcher against the wall, and on

that stretcher she does see a single bullet.

F obviously if in fact this is the same bullet that she

has spoken about, if in fact it is the Kennedy stretcher, raises

.a question. This is an area we are in the process of investi-

gating at the moment.

The second area that at the moment we have been doing some
looking into involves an allegation that concerns wiretapping
by the CIA in Mexico where they picked up conversations of.
Oswald. Suffice it to say - here again, I guess frechave to
put it. in context 3 the CIA had testified before the Warren
Commission of no prior contact with Oswald known to then prior

to the assassination until they then checked the records’ after

the assassination and stated that they found a conversation

that Oswald had had in Mexico with the Russian Embassy prior
to the assassination, and they dug this out post~assassination.
That has been their position ever since. The contention
here is that in fact there was more contact by the CIA with
Oswald than what they have disclosed.
A former CIA agent named Phillips was reported in the

press to have made some statements which if true were contrary

to. what the CIA had publicly said before the Warren Commis-
sion. We brought that former CIA agent Phillips before an
executive session of the Kennedy Subcommittee, and it was
chaired by Mr. Preyer, and Mr. Thone, and took Mr. Phillips’
testimony under oath.

Y the substance of the testimony by Mr. Phillips 7-‘and we
have the transcript; it is available rn is as follows.. This
could perhaps be of some importance. Mr. Phillips said that
prior to the assassination of President Kennedy the CIA main-
tained a surveillance operation in Mexico City of the ‘Cuban
and Russian Binassies. The unit that was responsible. for
surveillance of knowing what was going on in the Cuban Embassy

Honel

was headed by Mr. Phillips, a Mr. Mewabe was responsible for

Hanel
knowing what was going on in the Soviet Embassy, Mepreiize be-

ing a CIA agent.

In addition, the CIA maintained a wiretap operation and
they were wiretapping what calls were coming into: the cuban
and Russian Fivassies, and they also had bugs in the Cuban
paeeeey and 'were picking up some conversations in the Cuban
Embassy. z

The way in which this operation ran was that the inter-

cept unit, if I can use that word, would monitor these conver-

sations. They would have a recording going on of these conver-

“Sations going into the Cuban and Russian Fowassies. There would
|

bea person listening to them as they were being recorded,

that after these conversations were recorded they were then
taken to either a Spanish or a Russian interpretor who would
then translate these recordings and they would be typed up.

GF vpon being typed up, these transcripts would be sent to a
Mr. ae Scott, who though not in a technical sense in command
of that operation in fact was the person who was running the
CIA. operation in Mexico. Mr. Scott would review the tran-
script and if it was a wiretap of a call into thé RuSsian

Embassy, he would forward that transcript to Mr:. Memeke, If

it were a wiretap going into the Cuban Embassy, he would send

that to Mr. Phillips. If it involved both, it would go. from

Hane.|,
Phillips to Memrrig3 or vice versa.

The procedure upon the transcript going to Phillips at

the Cuban unit and Manale at the Russian was then to advise -
other agencies of government, such as the FBI, State Depart
ment, concerning that information if it was significant.
In matters that were more unique, a cablegram would. be

prepared by either Mr. Mamede-or Mr. Phillips, which would be
routed back to Mr. Scott, and if he approved it that Copies
would then be sent advising CIA Headquarters in Washington as
to that particular intercept, that being done in the more

unusual situation. 2

He also testified that these transcripts, the recordings

. themselves, normally were destroyed not by just a destruc-

tion x nothing ulterior in that sense -- but by a reuse of

these records after they had been transcribed.

Gan response ee a question, would there not be a périod
of time to hold a recording for the eeenecrine to be reviewed
and perhaps a decision being made, that there might be a need
to keep that recording itself, Mr. Phillips said, yes, but
what that period of time would be and whether there was any

formal order, directive, he was not prepared to say.- I. sug-

“gested to him, "What if we picked up a conversation in which

someone was calling and threatening to,say, assassinate a
congressman, would there not be a decision someunete to’ hold
that tape, you might want to use that for evidence, maybe. to
identify a voice or something?"

He said, "Yes, we would."

"What was the criteria that you would uge”’if you heard
that an American was trying to get out of the country? Would
that be a matter to keep?"

He was not prepared to say.

In any event, what Mr. Phillips said happened specifically
in regard to Oswald was there was an intercept of a conversa-
tion by Oswald to the Russian Embassy, and Oswald was ‘in fact
calling from the Cuban Embassy. Mr. Phillips said that to the

ana there is no. doubt as to the

j ;
first. part of this jy one part of that conversation was Oswald‘

‘advising the Russians that he wanted to get out of this coun-"

try, that he wanted to get to Cuba, and then-to Russia.

Gy Mr. Phillips stated what I would consider in an unsatis-
factory fashion, a rambling fashion, that it was his feeling
from the way in which the words appeared in the transcript
that: Oswald was indicating that the Russians perhaps ought to
be talking to him and that they perhaps ought to give him some
aid in getting out of the country. I say to you I feel that
Mr. Phillips said it without any degree from my standpoint. of
authority but that this was an attempt to get out of ‘the coun-
try is clear.

Mr. Phillips states that as a result of that £ and that

Mane] 1

transcript came to him first and then went on. to Mr. Matratke a
there were two things that he noted, that in this transcript it
referred to the fact that Oswald was speaking poor Russian
and there were notations typed on here of the poor quality of
the Russian that was being spoken, typed on the transcript,
and some other comments.

Asa result, Phillips testified that a cablegram was pre-

Hone l, Hane ly

pared by Mr. Manna signed by Mr. Masa submitted to Mr.
Phillips and signed by Mr. Phillips, to then be given to Mr.
Scott to be sent to CIA Headquarters in Washington because
this information put it in a more unusual category.

That cablegram states Mr. Phillips specifically stated

that they had picked up this information that Oswald was. trying

to get out of the country, seeking a visa to go to Cuba and

then on to Russia. That becomes of some significance because

the cablegram that in fact was sent by the Mexican station

to Washington omits that and the cablegram that in fact was
sent from the Mexican station to Washington merely states that
Oswald was contacting the Soviet Embassy and was inquiring
whether they had received a response to a telegram that he

had sent, whether the intercepted messages of Oswald calling
the Soviet Embassy was his inquiry about a telegram, but that

is in addition to the transcript to which I have made refer-

ence.

Gf We have asked Mr. Phillips, "Are you positive that the
cablegram that you prepared was alerting Washington that this
stipposed American was trying to get out of the country?" he
said, "Yes," He is absolutely sure as to that.

"Do you have any explanation for the cablegram that was
in fact sent?"

His response was that it seems to him it would be acts”
of negligence by a number of people or a deliberate .decision
by a person not to have that information conveyed.

The second aspect of Mr. Phillips' testimony that is of

A H | » . ¢
some signicance 7- these are areas that were investigated bring-

ing up to date this is what we are doing or in this same cable-

an American seen going into the Russian Embassy on the date

‘of this intercept. This description + we thought ‘the liter-

14 G) I did ask Mr. Phillips, "Well, did you make any attempt

16 Embassy at that time? What pictures did they take of people
- going into the Cuban Embassy? What were your surveillance re-
18 ports?"
19 And he said, "No, we did not."
“Why not?"
21 He had no response.
(2) zeal 22 The sequel to that, of course, is apparently after the
23 assassination when the CIA was asked to furnish what photo-
O 4 graphs they had of Americans entering the Cuban Embassy on
or that day, the response was that their equipment aia not work

on that day and they have no such photographs.

Gf wut we did get back to the fact that under Phillips'

3 || testimony you have a cablegram conveying information of an

4 || American trying to get out of the country. When asked by us

: 5 || whether the FBI or other authorities were notified as to that
6 || information, he did not know. In fact, it appears that they
7 || were not notified. The information that appears in the cable-

8 || gram to Washington, i.e., that Oswald was merely asking about a

g || telegram, that is the extent of the information that was’ con-
10 veyed to the other agencies.
7 When the CIA responded from Washington’ they of - course’

“12 alerted Mexico that Oswald had prior defected to Russia and

ro , 3 had married a Russian wife. And I asked Mr. Phillips. upon
4 getting that response, "Knowing this is an American trying
. to get. out of the country going to Cuba, which it was a vio-"
"6 lation of the law for Americans to do at that time, what
17 would you do?"

you would have commenced a surveillance while he was still-in
Mexico, what did you do to alert other agencies of the Fed-
eral Government. Whegever he was back in the United States
they should now commence a surveillance.

GF] ue. Phillips said he did not.

“Why not?"

\

“Because we assumed the other agencies of government
would do whatever was appropriate for them to do," but he
conceded that was a an assumption; they were told this
American was trying to get out of the country and we have
gotten access to those documents of notification. to the FBI, ;
the Department of State, and Immigration. None of them were
told about this part of the intercept.

What makes the area more complex at the moment, after
interviewing Mr. Phillips we dispatched two of our staff to
Mexico to contact the person who was the transcriber, the
interpreter of the wiretap, and the person who typed it, who":
in fact is the wife of that translator. ae

We have interviewed them and they are both available at
some point to come before this committee and testify, es well
as'Mr. Phillips, publicly. They have stated that, yes, they
remember the conversation and they took it down, but.no part

of it was in Russian... In fact, the translator saysg #

type any notes this thing that the man. spoke in poor Rus-
sian or any 1S.

GY There definitely was a part of the transcript that the
wife remembers vividly which included Oswald stating that he
wanted financial assistance from the Russians to get out of
this country.

We have obtained the typewriter that this lady says per-
haps she used in the typing here of the transcript. We went
to get the documents and submit them to these people, our
people, for them to look at, determine whether these are the
transcripts; are these different transcripts. We want to
find out what were the original cablegrams that existed and
find out why the change.

I might say this in addition. This area is apparently
sensitive enough to the CIA that although I have not yet been
cleared, none of our staff in the security classifications;
the CIA contacted me and on an ad hoc basis. granted an immedi-
ate clearance to have me look at what they submitted were
the transcripts of these conversations in their reports con-
cerning the Mexican operation.

I must say that what appears in their transcripts is
at variance with what Mr. Phillips has said and what the

translator and typist in Mexico have said in their transcripts.

lation, which of course would be at variance with what is

there.

G We are investigating this matter. That brings you up to

date as to this particular area.

Passing on for a moment, we in the Martin Luther King
case have. been in touch with a lawyer, a person who was’ for-
merly head of the Department of Corrections in Tennessee who

has advised us of personal conversations he has had with

James Earl Ray where in one of those conversations Ray told.

him that when Ray was over in Portugal, Ray, pursuant to ar-
rangements, contacted somebody to get his further instructions
as to what to do, and pursuant to those instructions he was

directed to go on to Belgium to where he was headed when he

was arrested.

Again, these are areas that we are working in.

The other area in Dr. King's case at the moment,’ it does

“appear that a police officer who had been assigned for secur~

ity for Dr. King + had been requested as a matter of fact

by Dr. King's staff to supply security in Memphis 3p ened

eda fe was called off the detail just about lo hours price
to the assassination of Dr. King. The stories that we are
obtaining from the various individuals who appear to sponsor: the

calling off are contradictory stories, one story Being that

him away. But the source of that Plot, because 4 one of the
things we are trying to do is pin down these people if there is

a plot to kill Reddie, who is the source of that information

and see how bona fide this was, or was this merely an attempt

to get the officer away who might have been in a position to

observe and stop something.

ae I say, the stories we are getting are conflicting at
the moment and we are investigating back to find out in as
much detail as we can to then present them in ei nedeiielnee
fore this committee.

I would say in the main that represents the limited
amount of investigative work that we are in the process of
doing.

Ghairman Downing. You did examine the guilty plea of Ray.
Have you told the committee about that? i

Mr. Sprague. I believe I did, Mr. Chairman, at the ‘earl-

Mr. Gonzalez. The CIA had surveillance on both freas-

one that he might have known. about? :

Gf we. Sprague. Yes. We are seeking to identify each and
every individual. I may say in another area that slipped my
mind, in dealing with the translator and the typist in Mex-
ico, contrary to again what the CIA has indicated at. least to
the Warren Commission, not any real knowledge here, nothing
that alerted them, the typist and the translator in Mexico
acknowledged when they picked up the first intercept that
their CIA contact whom they named to us was alarmed about. ‘this
sufficiently to say to them this is very important. “The
moment you pick up another intercept we have to know about
it, expressing grave concern about this matter.

Mr. Gonzalez. For years it has been known for -instance
that the Russians in Mexico have had four or five times the
Cane of personnel in their embassy than, say, the american
and the British combined. Do the CIA officials know of any
kind of counterintelligence where they might be taking -pictures
of our people taking pictures of theirs? Because there has°.
been no doubt that for years they have had a vast army of
ereoaner® way beyond what the picture is of commercial and
other interchange between. Obviously there has been intelli-
gence here but the figure is astounding, for our five times
more. So it would seem perhaps our intelligence efforts could
have been outdone in the case of the Russians. 2

Would there be any possibility of some transposing there

of information?

Mr. McKinney. The typists you talk about, were these
Mexican or American citizens, CIA agents or just people?

What is their background?

Mr. Sprague. The background: The typist is a Mexican
and the translator, if I recall, is a former Russian.

Mr. McKinney. In other words, is it ‘he CIA practice to
hire people like that from a foreign country and not use their
own service?

Mr. Sprague. I do not feel qualified to speak.on the

our problems is we can only go in to pinpoint some areas and

even in doing this it really reemphasizes my point as to the

kind of staff to do an adequate job here.

q Be. McKinney. As far as you can tell from what Phillips
said, the CIA made no effort to inform anyone, including the
Immigration Service or the guards at the Mexican border, that
Oswald had left?

Mr. Sprague. That is from what we have to this point
apparently clear. They made no attempt to notify anyone he
was out of Mexico and they made no attempt to notify that
this person was seeking to get out of the country and go-to
Cuba and Russia.

of the country and changed it to omit that specific informa-
‘tion, whether that was done on anybody's orders or not...

Dh wx. Sprague, I am advised that Mesrake and his wife are

alive, the typist and translator of course are. There is a
whole raft of people. We have to find out the people in that
intercept unit and hear what it is they say occurred.

There is a question in my mind even on the destruction
of the tape. For example, if this situation was unusual
enough to warrant a cablegram being sent to CIA Headquarters
in Washington, would not there at. least be a thought to main-
tain that tape until you get'a response from Washington?

These are areas of inquiry.

Mr. McKinney. One last question. I wondered. semewinad
what your timetable was.

Mr. Sprague. I do not mean to be facetious in Yesponse.
I think it would be wrong to have Ray feel astseis this mo-

to come scrounging and begging to him. You know in the
Yablonski case they were trying to get me to question ‘Tony
Boyle right off the bat, if I came to him, "What makes you
think I am going to tell you everything?"

There is a psychological timing to get to someone. In
my view there are a couple of things that are important before

GW Finally, and in all good course, Ray has been in corres-

is represented at the moment by a lawyer named James Lesar.

He was represented by an attorney named Fensterwald, who’ we
did find. The appellate courts in Tennessee have ordered
Lesar to remain in the case, which he is doing. Ray also has
an investigator, one of the critics of the Warren Commission
named Weisberg, and there is some sort of problem existing
not only between them and us but between Ray and these people.
Frankly, one of the things from the psychological, standpoint,
I.am hoping that at some point Ray kind of does not continue
to have these people representing him and may want to: be in-
itiating some contacts ps his part.

each of them at the moment. However, trying to hand out a

carrot at the same time, I have been talking with Mr. Ray's

-_present lawyer, Mr. Lesar, with regard to obtaining from Ray

a waiver of attorney-client relationship as to all of his
prior counsel, and if I can get that, I would rather proceed
in that vein.

G The probabilities are we can still get it because Ray
in his various legal proceedings has attacked his prior ‘coun-

client privilege, but I would rather not get to that step if
I could proceed in the first way of getting pre eisertee

that I say has that in part is a Soviet call with Oswald
speaking to the Russian Embassy, and it could be a little
unclear from the transcript as to who is making the state-
ment but it is clear it is referring to Oswald being the one
to go out of the country.

the Warren Commission clear that of the two stretchers against
the wall in the basement, one was Kennedy's stretcher and one
was Governor Connally's?. I had a recollection that the

us with some information with reference to a formér FBI

relative ;
agent who gave information, to the type of heavy surveillance

on Dr. King in the Atlanta area, and in the Memphis area,
and the fact that when he left one jurisdiction he was
picked up in the other jurisdiction, et cetera. Have you
been able to follow up on that line of surveillance activity
by the FBI?

Mr. Sprague. We are in the process, as I think I said
previously, of trying to obtain from the House its other
documents that they alreaftif have on the COINTELPRO. operation,
which was the FBI surveillance of Dr. King. We have not
yet succeeded in getting those documents. We have learned
the names of two other former FBI agents who were part of

the surveillance of Dr. King, and we are advised they have

information they are desirous of giving us. We have not yet
gotten to that.
PD we. McKinney. Can I interrupt for a moment?

Why are you having so much. trouble getting things in
the same pi@liding we are sitting in right now?

Mr. Sprague. Well, the technical side of it is that
through the fhairman we have contacted I guess it was the -
Speaker's office. As to the other, we were referred to
the frerk. We were told we would have to contact someone i
who is.in a position of being a representative for the committee
It has just been a long drawn-out process. And I may throw
in we have had the same thing with regard to the Senate
intelligence area, where we go from.one to the next, .and then
we go to eee of the chief counsel, and we are told he is
not going to be back in town for a couple of weeks. It is
that kind of thing. I am not saying we are not going to
get them. But frankly, at this moment it has not been
breaking my heart that we have not gotten them, because I
do not know that we can do much about them. We are now’ getting
in the process where I would like to get them. Rather than
any thought for the committee now, at our next meeting if we
do not have them and we are in the process to go ahead then, °

A

porther inquiry:

I would get back to you on that.

Mr. Stokes. If I could have just one

In light of the lead that you now have that a member of the
Department of Justice was perhaps registered at the same hotel
as Dr. King, have you proceeded to attempt to get ahold of the
record of all persons registered at or about that time?

Dye. Sprague. Yes. And one of the other things we are
trying ee is find out, in the interviewing of witnesses,

what interviews existed even of this person, if he was

“allegedly there, and if none, then why none?

Mr. Stokes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman Downing. Mr. Fauntroy.

Mr. Fauntroy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I am interested in the handwriting, or the notes on the
transcripts of the conversations in the Kennedy cage.

Do. I understand you to say that the records which appear

in Washington had notation in handwriting that the subject -

spoke poor Russian?

_ Mr. Sprague. That part is typed in.
Mr. Fauntroy. It was typed in.
Mr. Sprague. Typed in. On the side there is handwriting
that this is the translation from the Russian, and that
‘is in handwriting.
Mr. Anderson. Could I interject at that point?

Does that raise the possibility that we are talking in

| fact about a couple of conversations, one where he spoke

English and one where he did speak poor Russian?

is one of the things that we are examining oa the totality,

The problem with that is, though, that in looking at

are the total transcripts, at least the CIA advised os

they showed, there is nothing there that conforms to

the people, the typist down in Mexico is saying, from

standpoint.

Mr. Fauntroy. The typist in Mexico indicates that she
no trouble typing the transcript because what she heard
in English.

Mr. Sprague. That is right. And I might also say,
esponse to Mr. Anderson as well, these two people, this
slator and typist, state that on all calls to the Russian
ssies, they would be the ones to type and translate a
e would not have been anyone else.

Mr. Fauntroy. May I ima quickly go to the

matter?

Do I understand that the index of files available in
his includes both local police records and FBI records

11 surveillance undertaken by the FBI in Memphis?

Mr. Sprague. I cannot say all surveillance. I can

say that the index indicates that there are surveillance

rds by FBI and local police here. But I would not say

which either the,FBI or the local police had among the
Consisfing 0%
InvaderSya Group of young people who had been active in
demonstrations and on whom they blamed the violence in the
first demonstration?

Mr. Sprague. I do not see anything in the index-that
would indicate that. But we have not yet read and digested
this material in any detail. All we have-done is just 30 ‘theoial
and itemize what was there.

Mr. Fauntroy. But there is no indication of the source
of what surveillance information they have on hana?

Mr. Sprague. I cannot even say that, Mr. Fauntroy,
because we have not read what is there. All we have done is
take what are the items that appear there. The analysis
and reading of itis yet to be done.

Mr. Fauntroy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman Downing. Mr. Sprague, I would be interested

we. all. understand the need for immediate investigation of
IMr. Phillips, as that broke suddenly. The bullet theory is
jan important one. But you take the numerous irregularities”

information that there were two rifles in the Texas Depository,

Mr. Preyer. Would the gentleman yield? I was

wondering on one point along that line, which would not be

sensationalizing it, but which you have given some substance
to, here, that could be made in a report, is the incompleteness
of the other investigation. You have mentioned the two
student nurses who had not been seen by any investigator.
And I understand these translators in Mexico, the ones who
translated the intercept, have never been talked to by
anyone,

Mr. Sprague. That is correct.

Mr. Preyer. Which is a rather startling commentary on
the quality of the investigation.

Mr. Sprague. Mr. Preyer, isn't that amazing, that
even the CIA, with the questions that have been raised
about their own transcript, have never themselves gone back
to the primary source as to who did it. That I find

amazing.

; Gf we. anderson. Mr. Chairman, following, I think, the trend
of your question, and also Mr. Preyer's thought, and in my
question I betray my ignorance of computer technology ~

is it possible, because you will have some computer capability,
as I understand it, tied into the House computer, to program

a computer in such a way that you can somehow highlight

}and pinpoint the discrepancies that admittedly do exist in

the papers that are now extant on this whole investigation, both
investigations?

Mr. Sprague. Yes, Mr. Anderson.

Mr. Anderson. Is that one way of proceeding, in which
you could rather quickly highlight a whole series of things that
are questionable, and that deserve the amount of time and money
and attention that will be given in this investigation?

Mr. Sprague. It is a way of proceeding. As a matter
of fact, that is one of the reasons we are going to be using
the computer. It is broader based. In fact, it could be
doing exactly that in terms of discrepancies and corroboration.
It works both ways. The problem at the moment is it would
‘be impossible in the time frame between now and frankly the
end of this year to be able to program and do that.

Mr. Gonzalez. Also financially, isn't that correct?

Mr. Sprague. Oh, yes. We do not even have the
money.

Mr. Gonzalez. You don't have the $100,000 for that.

q yr. Sprague, We are down to just about $25,000 at
this moment.
Mr. Gonzalez. We have a Catch-22 proposition here.

. Mr. Fauntroy. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to the point which
you raised, and which Mr. Anderson mentions, I admire® the
thoroughness and ground: work, the approach you have been
taking, to the investigation. But I have been ‘in 4 sort of
a dilemma, personally, about how to proceed. In the first
instance, I recognize we do need a little something’ to

the ; :
take to 2a Floor, and we need public interest stimulated
if we are in fact to be able to do the thorough job that you
outline here.

I have wondered whether or not it might be useful.

to have someone on the staff, or a small group on the staff,

to go over thoroughly much of the research, many of the

books that have been written + some of them positing theories
about how the assassinations were carried out and by whom,

and that sort of thing, with a view to arriving at one: two

or three propositions that have been made by some of those $
‘some have seemed to be very thorough in their investigations >
as a starting point, to see if there is in fact anything
there.

off in terms of somebody's theory here and there.. I: really

Pinvestigation.

Chairman Downing. Are. you now or would you next week be
in a position fo say that the Warren investigation was not

Mr. Gonzalez. Excuse me for interrupting before
you answer. Let me say this, Mr. Chairman. I don't think
that we should have to try to reach for the sensational, or
the tantalizing thing, to dangle before the Members of the
House, in order for us to get the approval for this. We have

to confront each and every Member of the House,as if it

were us W that is assuming that they are men of good reason

and all. Because just as many of the critiques and the theories

and the hypotheses that you have in both homicides, you

have almost an equal number of apologias a that is people
writing books sustaining those findings. So I think if

we get into that, we are going to be chasing rabbits right off

Di think we have got to look at it this way. And the
reason I interrupted before I even gave him a chance to answer
his + the Warren Commission + I have even seen members
of the Congress say, "We are reopening that." We are not reopen
ing anything. This is the first time it has ever been done.
The, Congress has never undertaken this.

I had a reporter argue, "Well, you had the Church
domnittee, you had the Pike fonmittee." It is not the same thing
They never had a grant of authority to look into this.

They stumbled upon some peripheral matters in looking into
the intelligence agencies. of the Federal Government that had
to do with Kennedy, that had to do with Martin futher King.
But they were peripheral. They. never had the authority,

they never had the resources to go into this.
