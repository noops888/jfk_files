Remyairtel, 3/6/61.

on 3/8/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, as
follows:

Recently, one RALPH THOMAS, no other identifying information,
took about $2,000 worth of knives, forks and other utensils, all
made of aluminum, to KELLY MANNARINO in Florida, reason unknown.
There were foo many for. MANNARINO.to use in his home in Surfstie,
Fla., so KELLY must have a restaurant or other outlet there.

SAM MANNARINO recently visited Florida, and while he was there
he did not stop to see his brother, KELLY. This probably means
Nea they are still feuding. :

a On the same date, PG 612-C furnished SA FORSYTH with a copy of
an Empire Treasury Lottery Ticket, obtained 3/3/61, at City

outlet operated by TOM LATTOS and his wife, DONNA, At that
time, informant stated these tickets are being distributed in
the New Kensington area by the’ "MANNARINO mob." “4
