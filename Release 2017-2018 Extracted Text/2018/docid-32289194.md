SAMUEL MANNARINO; aka.

AR

Remyairtel, 3/6/61.

On 3/8/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, as

follows:

Recently, one RALPH THOMAS, no other identifying information,

took about $2,000 worth of

knives, forks and other utensils, all

made of aluminum, to KELLY MANNARINO in Florida, reason unknown.

There were too many for MANNARINO. to use in his

home in Surfside,

Fla., so KELLY must have a restaurant or other outlet there.

SAM MANNARINO recently visited Florida, and while he was there

he did not stop to see his brother, KELLY. This probably means

that they are still feuding.

On

the

same date, PG 612-C furnished SA FORSYTH with a copy of

an Empire Treasury Lottery Ticket, obtained 3/3/01, at City

News,

859 Third Ave.,

New Kensington, Pa.,

a numbers racket

•outlet operated by TOM LATTOS and his wife, DONNA.

At that

time, informant stated these tickets are being distributed in

the New Kensington area by the "MANNARINO mob.

If he is still being contacted, Miami will ascertain from

JOSEPH MEROLA or any other logical source, the reason

• for SAM

MANNARINO's visit to Florida and the use made of the

aluminum utenails by GABRIEL MANNARINO.

Pittsburgh will attempt to obtain additional information

regarding RALPH THOMAS and will also attempt to ascertain

the identity.of the actual distributer of the Empire lottery

ticket in New Kensington.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
