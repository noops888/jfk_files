Subject: Background on Mexico Stetion Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage, From the time the Mexico Station was onened in
April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to ae
exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy, This umbrella type vroject (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance
team and a mail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by an io foe of the telephone conipany

Tetane of Wa Antal lee

who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines
5

es

tapped was linited' by availability of a listening post nearby
(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

s good security in that

(which the station at that time felt

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIc,

that block. LIMITED was the first base ard it operated strictly on an

exverimentel basis in the early stages. I think the Mexi Station bought
one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the

public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

nearby. The operty vas sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of 4 new apartment blding to be built
on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street
as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South, It had a slanted view of
the front gate of the Soviet Erbessy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both
Mexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other,
LILYRIG was a rented apartment, LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station purchesed in about 1958 (check date), also using

LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check), This site overlooked the back garden of

Ramon Alvarez (i an citizen of U.S. mother who taught elementary level at

the American School). Ramon collected the film apSdwnerkpabubwegatitm from LIMIT

was for LICALLA film to ve srocessegyfaside, 78) van from 1957 to 1959 (Harper
Holt - resigned) could not handle the volume and as the unprocessed film began
to accumulate, the inside CO (Mahoney) became disgusted and took the film out

The plan was to activete this

when someone of interest left
until they made their meetings. These agents knew about the LIMITED
BASE be€ause they had LIMITED photos for identification purposes.

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and

vas arrested by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the
Mexican Secret Service, By the time the Stetion could arrange through
a cleared attorney to bail him out (Judd Austin of the Goodrich,
Little and Riquelme firm), the agent had identified Sancho (who wes
evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside

phone number of Mahoney (who wes subsequently replaced by Louis

Puckett), As a result of this flap, the LIFRAT project was broken

up into several others, The agents were not changed but were

a sub-agent in the postal system (I think at the airport). His case officers

were later/Puckett, Robert Feldmann, and Alan White.

2. ‘Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by the nature

of the Mexiean services at that time. The Mexican DFS (Direction of Federal

Seourity) with which we dealt was a hip pocket group run out of the Ministry /

Of Government, This Ministry spent a major part of. its time oh control of

foreigners and political investigations. Their agents were vicious, venal,

corrupt extortionists. Robert Mclberg established contact with one of them aot

Levine De Leon (later LIFIRE group) in about 1950 or 51, He gave them some
training (a group of about five surveillance types) in travel control working
the airport as well as file searches-of names from DFS Hatrs! where the files
were poorly organized and often inaéeurate, Now and then, however, some useful
information was developed but it could not be depended upon. :Melberg iwas
replaced by Phil Roettinger (resigned and remained in Mexico), Mahoney, Thomas
Hazlitt, and Robert Feldmannéva Qs VW Citun )

During 1958, Win Scott met socially some of the ¢hronies of the
Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopes Mateos. During this period, the U.S.
Ambassador Robert C, Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)
was energetic in organizing groups to "fight communism". One of these seeds
grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former Mexi President), acting
for Lopez Mateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This
project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.
The Mexican in contro] (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His
son (LIENvoy-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGAIT also
manipulated control over the principal agent of LIBIGHT mail intercept. The
first case officer was Alfonso Spera inside with Turner Smith (retired) outside
and John (ISD training officer for surveillance and head of the listening

post where thirty telephone lines would connect as well as a transcription room

staffed by Mexican army officers.) Initially the stetion tried to met every

demand made by the Mexicans. Both Smith end_John hed language difficulties and

personal problems associated with being outside the station so thet the Mexicans

were virtually uncontrollable, spendi:g money es they pleased, squirrelling away

equipment st enormous costs, and neglecting their part of the bargain in the

production of transeripts or placing taps which we wanted, Spera was replaced

by Jack Brady who found himself in the seme pincer movement of having Scott

approve a request by LINLEGANT that Brady had turned down by the son, LIENVOY-2,

Finally when the cost became exhorbitant and there was little to show for it,

the project was revamped. Smith and John returned to the U.S. end were replaced

by a TSD officer, Charles Flick, who vas put inside the listening post to maintain
Bredy wes reassigned to other duties pending a transfer.

the equipment./ Scott took over the project as case officer meeting with LIELEGAIT.

He designated Ann Goodpasture to meet dailing with Flick for routine supervision

of the listening post, picking up transcripts and tapes. Goodpasture had no

dealings with the Mexicatis except when Scott was ill or cut of town. Generally,

all decisions were made by Scott. This was about late 1961.

3. My memory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Embassy but I

think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New

Years eve 1959, As I recall, it was a makeshift arrangement of volunteers

through most of 1960 end 61 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on

their activities end recruitirg agents right and left among Cuban nationals in
Mexico City.

About mid 1962 (check date) LIE

"NYOY outside Mexi rept asked

for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Exbassies.

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) wes disconnected, However,
as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, end 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

monitor vho mede skort sumeries of interesting conversetions for @ daily

resume which was received each day around & a.m. (passed by Flick to Goodpasture
to get to Scott vefore 9 a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

e way, however,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the stetion in the
there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which hdd

age besides Spanish or English vent out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was
typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were trenslated
and typed. In the cese of the Russian transletions, Boris Tarasoff usually ren
about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of
Russian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Embassy. During this
period (fsll of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave
it to Herbert Manel] to take to Boris, Herbert Manell and his wife Berbara

handled ell of the processi:.g of Soviet transcripts, nvolved screening

the photographs as soon es we lerrned thet the man cal self Oswald wes

probably en Auericen, However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones picked up were usually

for dates a few days prettiously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Fhotogrephs were made usually until one roll ves used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

new Soviet and family, all foreigners and foreign lieense plates. Human

error did occur but generally the egents were conscientious. The Cuban
embessy coverege had more sophisticated equipment (a pulse camera) but it
frequently developed rechanical difficulties, Bob Zambernardi and Spathar
(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery, Lorne MacKay screened
the film inside the station.

I am certain thet the Oswald call came to our attention from the
Soviet line. It was picked u; snd taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of
transcripts everf made in languages other than Spanish or English because Win
Scott could read only those two languages end he »ersonally screened the

trenscripts for operational leads he vanted pursued.
