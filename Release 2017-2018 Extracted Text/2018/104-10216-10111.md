partially successful. The two major objectives of this operation were:
one, to re-contact ANTRUNK-10; and two,to bring into the infiltration/
exfiltration area a cache of weapons and explosives as requested by
AMLASH-1. Operation ANTRUNK VIII was successful onty tn fulfilling the
latter objective because the team was fired upon by a patrol craft at the
start of tho infiltrstion phase, and, after returning the fire, escaped
to an alternate coastal landing area. The cache was emplaced in Lorth-
wester:: Las Villas Province on 18 March, the evening before the team's
exfiltration. Directions for its recovery were sent to AMTRUNK-10 by
8/# on 23 March, In addition to the weapons and explosives, the cache
also contained an OWL receiver for AMTRUNK-10, (complete with directions
and echedules) and extra 8/W supplies for both AMTRUNK-10 and AMTRUNK~11.
