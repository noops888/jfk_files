Details:

(U) On 1/3/1997, the ARRE formally advised the PRI

of the determinations voted by them on FBI documents at a meeting

held 12/17/1996. The ARRB letter listed 41 documents for which

the ARRB made determinations.

The FBI does not have any appeal

issues with the release of the material.

However,

the release of

the information in these documents will

reveal the identities of

105 individuals whom the documents described as potential

criminal informants (PCI), confidential informants (CI),

potential security informants (PSI), security informants (SI),

(RS) and sources of information (SOI).

The

ARRB decisions will also release what was previously classified

foreign counterintelligence information.

(U) The documents concerning the decisions from the

December 17 meeting are listed below by document number,

with the

information to be released. The status of informants and

sources, if found through research, is noted after the name with

living (L), deceased (D), no record (NR), or date of birth

(mm/dd/УУУ) .

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting

the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular

information, and classified information related to sources and

foreign relations as listed above. However, the ARRB supports

the position that the information

ordered disclosed is relevant

and

significant to the assassination.

They opine the pertinence

and

importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to

the individuals or the FBI's/United States Government's foreign

relations, informants or operational aspects.

(U) The JFKTF continues to advise CID, NSD and OGC of

the ARRB decisions. However,

with the narrowed scope of appeal

issues, NSD and CID recommendations are not being sought for

those decisions documented here. If you have questions, please

contact Barbara L. Hatch at extension 9482,

Carol L. Keeley at

extension 9494, or Carl Valentine at extension 9476.

Though

this source testified before the Subversive Activities

Control Board in the 1950's, and was therefore identified as an

FBI source, the scope of the information she furnished the Bureau

was much wider than her testimony revealed and she remained in

close contact with another valuable security informant of the San

Antonio office.

It is also noted her spouse was also a symbol

numbered informant.

The ARRB sustained their earlier decision

for the continued postponement of the name of source Herschel

Bernard (L) until 12/2006.
