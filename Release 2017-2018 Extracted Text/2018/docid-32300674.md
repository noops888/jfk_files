the TMA Club, New Kensington, Pa., by MIKE "BEN" NAMEY.

Three

of the dealers who are there working every day are ANDY MANGINI,

DANIEL "SPEEDO"; HANNA and SONNY

CIANCUTTI.

,0-Ball is a card game similar toppoker, but it is

played backwards.

In other words, the low hand wins instead

of the high hand.

On August 8, 1967, PG T-T advised:

He heard the "KELLY" MANNARINO group was interested

in a casino in the Caribbean but he does not know if they are

interested in GIL BECKLEY's casino in Antigua, British West

Indies.

BECKLEY, however, intends on giving this casino up

since he is losing money.

On September 14, 1967, PG I-3 advised:

KELLY MANNARINO receives $100 per week as his share

for permitting the operation of card

games at the TMA Club,

New Kensington, Pa.

F. POLICE AND POLITICAL. INFLUENCE

On August 23, 1967, PG T-2 advised:

Last

week, Detective FRANK LINK. New Kensington Police

Department, said that "the old man,

(this means KELLY) had flown

south and that LINKand the Chief of Police of New Kensington

Police Department are going to meet KELLY at Palm Beach, Fla.

LINK then advised that he needed money for the trip and

the

informant gave him $100 because informant feared a physical

beating from Detective LINK. A day or so after he had had a

meeting with' LINK, he saw KELLY MANNARINO from a distance in

New Kensington, Pa.,

and on August 22, 1967, he saw LINK talking

to KELLY in New Kensington, Pa.

There is a conflict between KELLY and the Mayor of

New Kensington due to the fact that the Mayor will not bend to

KELLY's wishes and LINK was placed in his present position at

the New Kensington Police Department to keep an eye on the Mayor.

Ihe Warren City and Telephone Directories and

the Haines Youngstown-Warren City and Suburban addressakey-

telokey directory failed to list either the name of ARTHUR

MARKS or the address of 2620 Risher, S. W., Warren.

It is to be noted that this is extremely

sensitive information, and it would still appear that no

active inquiry be made in Washington so that the informant

will not be placed in a compromising position., Continued

contacts will be made with the informant, and when positive

information is developed, all interested offices will be

advised.
