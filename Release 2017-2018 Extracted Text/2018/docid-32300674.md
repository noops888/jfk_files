the TMA Club, New Kensington, Pa., by MIKE "BEN" NAMEY. Three
of the dealers who are there working every day are ANDY MANGINI,
DANIEL "SPEEDO#, HANNA and SONNY CIANCUTTI.

Lo-Ball is a card. game similar toppoker, but it is
played backwards. In other words, the low hand wins instead
of the high hand.

On August 8, 1967, PG T-7 advised:

He heard the "KELLY" MANNARINO group was interested
in a casino in the Caribbean but he does not know if they are
interested in GIL BECKLEY's.casino in Antigua, British West
Indies. BECKLEY, however, intends on giving this casinow
since he is losing money.

On September 14, 1967, PG T-3 advised:

KELLY MANNARINO receives $100 per week as his share
for permitting the operation of card games at the TMA Club,
New Kensington, Pa.

F. POLICE AND POLITICAL. INFLUENCE

On August 23, 1967, PG T-2 advised:

New Kensington Police
Department, said that fe old man, this means KELLY) had flown
south and that LINKad the Chief of Police of New Kensington
Police Department are going to meet KELLY at Palm Beach, Fla.
LINK then advised. that he needed money for the trip and the
informant gave him $100 because informant feared a physical
beating from Detective LINK. A day or so after he had had a
meeting with LINK, he saw KELLY MANNARINO from a distance in

New Kensington, Pa., and on August 22, 1967, he saw LINK talking
to KELLY in New Kensington, Pa.

There is a conflict between KELLY and the Mayor of
New Kensington due to the fact that the Mayor will not bend to
KELLY's wishes and LINK was placed in his present position at
the New Kensington Police Department to keep an eye on the Mayor.

On August 4, 1967, PG T-3 advised:

time, but stated the job will be for between one and two
million dollars, and after he has had a chance to study the
plans and before making his bid, Unknown Subject, employed |
by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, is allegedly coming to i
Youngstown at which time he will discuss the job with H

locate a home in the area, where he gurrently resides.

of locating GIORDANO and was unable to do.so in the Warren
area, stated "I had to call way over to New Kensington (Pa.)
to get the number," and furnished Warren phone 898-4741,
an unlisted number, as the residence of GIORDANO,

2620 Risher, S. Wes Warren, Ohio, a residence,

CV 646-C was recontacted on 4/14/67 and he
advised that he does not know the name of ARTHUR MARKS,

The Warren City and Telephone Directories and

.the Haines Youngstown-Warren City and Suburban addressakey-

telokey directory failed to list either the name of ARTHUR
MARKS or the address of 2620 Risher, S. W., Warren,

It is to be noted that this is extremely
sensitive information, and it would still appear that no
active inquiry be made in Washington so that the informant
will not be placed in a compromising position... Continued
contacts will be made with the informant, and when positive
information is developed, alb Bnterestéd offices will be
advised. eis :

ADMINISTRATIVE Say,

Bureau approval was received to check
telephone toll calls made by subject by reBulet
dated 10/20/66.

While the period of this report is
somewhat longer than desirable, it is due to the
belief that clarity and continuity would better be
served by awaiting results of leads set out in other
communications.
