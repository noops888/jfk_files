General Background: Detachment C advance party of
security and communication personnel departed the U.S.
for Atsugi, Japan, on 20 February 1957, the second echelon
of administrative personnel departed 4 March, and the main
body of the detachment with two U-2 aircraft and equipment
began deployment on 15 March. On 29 March Headquarters was
notified that all personnel and equipment were on base.
Operational readiness was forecast for the week of 8 April.
Operating procedures and liaison had been accomplished with
the following major U.S. components:

Far East Air Force

Far East ns and Theater Commander
Agency's Station] and local support unit
54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron

Atsugi Naval Air Station

Details or specific operating agreements or procedures
with the above components have not been located.

By mid-May 1957 the Detachment had flown 30 sorties.
All of these operations were preparations for the primary
mission of the Detachment. The first primary mission of the
Detachment, a flight over part of the USSR, occurred on
20 June 1957, however, this mission did not eriginate or
recover at Atsugi. eee

The first overflight of the USSR from Atsugi occurred
on 1 March 1958 and this flight was the only and last flight.
This flight, as other previous flights by other Detachments,
was tracked by Russian radar, even though the U-2 aircraft
had anti-radar applications, and a Soviet protest was made
on 5 March 1958 by the Soviet: Ambassador to Washington,
Mikhail Menshikov. Attached are copies of the Soviet
Aide Memoires of 5S March and 21 April 1958 (Tab A).

The Detachment continued to perform non-USSR missions
in the Far East area until the Powers flight of 1 May 1960.
Redeployment of the Detachment began in early July, the
last U-2 aircraft departed Japan on 9 July and all personnel
and other equipment cleared the base and turned the facilities
back to the Navy on 19 August 1960.

During the deployment of Detachment C it performed
approximately 86 operational missions, of these only 43
originated and recovered at Atsugi.

1. Any and all information pertaining to the take-
offs and landings of the U-2 at Atsugi, Japan,
limited to the years 1959 through 1962.

We have been unable to locate files which would
contain logs of all take-offs and landings of the U-2
aircraft assigned to Detachment C. In addition to
the mission flights stated above we must assume that
there were a large number of take-offs and landings
which would include flights for pilot familiarization,
training, equipment testing, transitional and flights
purely for cover purposes.

2. Any and all information concerning the radar
procedures, facilities, and staff involved with
the U-2 flights at Atsugi, Japan, limited to the
years 1959 through 1962.

As stated in the General Background above we have
not located details or specific operating procedures
or agreements with the local Navy base at Atsugi.

3. Any and all information pertaining to contact
‘i between Marine Air Control Squadron #1, Air
Group II, lst Marine Wing, and U-2 personnel at

We have not identified any relationship between
Detachment C and Marine Air Control Squadron #1 on
the subject of housing. We have noted that late in
1957 families were permitted at Detachment C and as
a result housing was provided in the compound assigned.
to the Agency Support Unit and-ten houses were rented
on the local market.
