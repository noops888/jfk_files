By mid-May 1957 the Detachment had flown 30 sorties.

All of these operations were preparations for the primary

mission of the Detachment. The first prinary mission of the

Detachment,

a flight over

part of the USSR, occurred on

on I March 1958 and this flight was the only and last flight.

This flight, as other previous flights by other Detachments,

by Russian radar, even though the U-? aircraft

had anti-radar applications, and a Soviet protest was made

on 5 March 1958 by the Soviet Ambassador to Washington,

We have been unable to locate files which would

contain logs of all take-offs and landings of the U-2

aircraft

assigned to Detachment C. In addition to

the mission flights stated above we must assume
