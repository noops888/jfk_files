Dear Mr, Levi:

I would like to thank you for the courtesy you extended
by promptly responding to my request to see you. Your action
exemplified the spirit of cooperation between the Executive
and Congress which prompted my request.

I do feel that my concern that the FBI clear for release
the documents with which I was concerned deserves your seri-
ous attention, While I am aware that the release of the docu-
ments may confirm the identity of a former FBI informant, I
feel the posture the Bureau has taken in publicly denying that
the events described in the documents ever took place neces-
sitates their release, if only to set the record straight, It
should be noted that the Bureau's public position in this situ-
ation, as well as in others, has been taken in direct response
to public statements I have made critical of past improper FBI
activities, Accordingly, it is the confirmation of improper
FBI activity, instead of the identity of the informant, with
which I am concerned. Further, it is my feeling that, based
on information I have received, the identity of the informant
is already common knowledge.

The other group of documents for which I sought release
concern FBI actions taken against the Black Panther Party in
North Carolina. These in no way involve a confidential source,
and I anticipate no problems with their clearance. Under sep-
arate cover I am furnishing Mr. Steve Blackhurst copies of the
documents for which I seek clearance.

Again, let me_express my appreciation to you for your as-

Sincerely,

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62116395

DETAILS: An Appendix to the SSC's Final Report on the

FBI's domestic intelligence work, entitled "Dr, Martin Luther
King, Jr., Case Study," was publicly released 5/5/76. On
page 146 appears information concerning the FBI's attempt

to determine the validity of an allegation in 1965 that

King had a numbered account in a foreign bank with a balance
of over $1,000,000, The information, as reported by the

SSC, indicates that the allegation was received by the

King case supervisor (writer) at the time and that he conceived
the plan to check out the allegation, Four footnotes
relating to this information (#289-292) appear at the bottom
of page 146. Three of the footnotes identify specific FBI
documents, copies of which we had furnished to the SSC,

One of the footnotes, #289, states, "I£ should be noted

that the Supervisor in charge of the King case is still in

a high position with the FBI and handled the committee's
documents requests in the King case investigation.”

The 5/6/76 issue of the "Los Angles Times" contains
an article on page 1 headed, "FBI Supervisor Who Sought to
Discredit King Still There." (Attached to the original
and to each copy of this memorandum is a Xerox of the article.)
The article reports rather fully the information on this
matter contained on page 146 and quotes almost in its
entirety the footnote quoted above, The article outlines
the author's (writer not identified in article but believed
to principally be Ron Ostrow) efforts to identify the
supervisor in charge of the King case and includes his
contacts with the SSC and Assistant Attorney General
J, Stanley Pottinger, It appears that the author's interest
prompting such a highlighted story stems from mearlier-
released statement by Pottinger that '"'the top nine persons
responsible for the FBI campaign all are either dead or
retired," When this statement of Pottinger is compared with
the footnote quoted above, the inconsistency is glaring.

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

This memorandum and the recommended action is
prompted by a deep concern of the writer for his own
personal safety, Without being theatrical or exaggerating,
the writer recognizes that walking the streets today are
individuals mentally or otherwise so affected that they
might attempt some act of violence in what they would
consider retaliation for the death of a martyred hero.
While this is a personal concern, there is an obvious
simultaneous impact on the Bureau should anything impair
the safety of the writer. While the writer's name is not
yet a matter of public record, it is certainly not unlikely
that the footnote in question will serve as the springboard
for such media or other investigation which will finally
result in an exposure of the writer, by name, as the King
case supervisor,

Two principal derelictions on the part of the
SSC are noted in relation to this matter, (1) The statement
that the writer is in a high position with the FBI is an
absolute falsehood, At the time the writer assumed
supervision of the King case, he held the lowest ranking
Special Agent position at FBIHQ, that of a Supervisor,
During the supervision of that case, he was elevated to
the position of Unit Chief and has never risen above that
position since supervising the King case, Significantly,
of nine position ranks at FBIHQ, from the Director to a
Supervisor, the Unit Chief is the next to lowest rank,
(2) By agreements between the SSC, the Department and the
Bureau, we were permitted to review drafts of the SSC's
reports so that we might call to its notice necessary changes
relating to classification, sensitivity of wmaterial, and
identities of personnel below rank of Section Chief. When
the draft of this Appendix was reviewed by the writer,

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

it did not contain the quoted footnote, Not only is
there considerable question as to the validity of the

quoted portion as a footnote rather than as being included
in the details of the material, but its mere post-review
addition raises considerable questions,

The writer hesitates to become accusatory as to
motive but is hard put to be dissuadedfrom belief that
this addition of the footnote was a deliberate act with
intention to eventual public uncovering of the writer's
name, The SSC has been furnished documents and the
writer, upon interview by the SSC Staff, furnished infor-
mation fully revealing of the positions which the writer
has held in the Bureau since his supervision of the King
case. In short, the SSC knows full well that the claim
that the writer is in a high position is a falsehood.

As the Director and other Bureau officials are
aware, an abuse by the SSC is nothing new to us, The
Department is also similarly aware, The current instance
is just the latest of many SSC abuses and, notwithstanding
the writer's personal feelings and involvement, he must
consider this as an extreme abuse,

I am, therefore, requesting that the Bureau,
through the Department, personally bring this matter to attention of
Senator Church and make crystal clear to him that the
Bureau, and I personally, consider this action by the SSC
with deep concern, dismay and that the Bureau and TI
protest the SSC's action, Under normal circumstances, as
head of our Senstudy 75 Project, I would handle this aspect
insofar as necessary correspondence and arrangements are
concerned, However, for obvious personal considerations,

I belie¥e this should be handled by our Legal Counsel

The purpose of this memorandum is to record contact with
Ron Ostrow, reporter for the "Los Angeles Times," and his agreement
to not pursue the identity of the FBI Supervisor mentioned in his
article of 5/6/76.

DETATLS On the evening of 5/5/76 Ron Ostrow, reporter for the
“Los Angeles Times," contacted Deputy Assistant Director Homer
Boynton of the External Affairs Division. Ostrow stated that the
Senate Select Committee (SSC) case study on Dr. Martin Luther King,
\ page 1467 Footnote F289, indicates that "the supervisor in charg
K of the King case is still in a high position with the FBI De

handled the Committee's documents request in the King case esti-
gation." Ostrow stated that this statement appeared to contradict
the comments of Assistant Attorney General J. Stanley Pottinger who
indicated approximately one week ago that the top 9 persons respon-
sible for the FBI campaign against Dr. King were all either dead

\ or retired.

Ostrow was advised that the individual alluded to in the
report was not a high official of the FBI and in the order of rank
of investigative employees at FBIHQ was near the bottom. Ostrow was
informed that this gentlemen in no way had anything to do with
policy-making or direction of activities against Dr. King. Ostrow
stated that he was most anxious to determine the identity of this
individual and had been in contact with Mr. Pottinger at the
Department of Justice.

the possibility that a deranged or warped-minded individual

might decide to make amends for what might be considered to

be an affront to Dr. King and attempt to do bodily harm to

Bureau employees responsible for these actions. The Director
agreed with this assessment of the problem and instructed that
Boynton contact Ostrow and ask him if he would be willing to desist
in his efforts to identity the FBI Supervisor.

On the afternoon of 5/6/76 Boynton met with Ron Ostrow
and conveyed the aforementioned concerns. Ostrow indicated that
he did not intend to pursue this matter any further unless he
received pressure to do so, in which case he would immediately
notify Boynton. In accordance with the Director's instructions,
if Ostrow is to proceed further, consideration will be given to
contacting higher level officials at the "Los Angeles Times" up
to and including the publisher in order to protect the identity
of Mr. Seymor Phillips in this matter.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: SENSTUDY 75
62=116395

At 3:10 p.m., 5/5/76, writer telephonically contacted
vissell Gray, Jr., Chicago, who advised as follows:

ody... Archbishop_of Chicago Diocese, Roman Catholic

# Ch; ‘who is just being released from hospital after surgery,
contacted Chicago Office to advise that "eastern press" has been
calling him about appearance of his name.in SSC report.on
Martin Luther King, Jr., investigation. Report reveals that
he had discussed King with an FBI Agent in 1966 and Cody

had little recollection of matter; could not even recall name
of contacting Agent. Gray referred writer to Chicago letter

to FBIHQ 2/24/66, re King written by then SAC Marlin Johnson
which reported a Johnson conversation with Cody concerning

King and other matters. Gray requested advice on two specific
matters: (1) Guidance for press inquiries; (2) What may
Chicago Office tell Cody and may it give him a_copy of the
Johnson letter to FBIHQ?

Page 172 of the Ssc report on King case entitled
"Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., Case Study," contains the
following two pertinent paragraphs mentioning Cody:

"In February 1966 Dr. King held a press
conference following a meeting with the Reverend
John P. Cody, Archbishop of the Chicago
Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, and
announced that he and Cody were in agreement
on general civil rights goals and that he
hoped priests and nuns in Chicago would
participate in SCLC programs. The Domestic
Intelligence Division subsequently .
recommended that a special agent acquainted
with the Archbishop brief him about Dr. King
to aid ‘the Archbishop in determining the degree
of cooperation his archdiocese will extend to King's
program,in Chicago and (to) result in a lessening
of King's influence in Chicago.'

"The Archbishop was briefed on February 24,

1966, ‘along the lines discussed with

Assistant Director Sullivan.’ The agent who
conducted the briefing wrote that he felt "certain |
that (Cody) will do everything possible to neutralize
King's effect in this area,'"

ayer se

NW 55172 DocTd:32989591 Page 23



Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: SENSTUDY 75
62=116395

The two paragraphs were supported by three
footnotes, two of which, #394 and 395 are to the
aforementioned Chicago letter (memorandum) of 2/24/66.

Files relating to our SENSTUDY 75 Project reveal that
we have furnished to the SSC a copy of 2/24/66 letter with some
excisions but which did reveal Johnson's conversation with Cody
about King. We also had furnished the SSC a copy of an internal
FBIHQ memorandum which documented the first paragraph
quoted above from the King report.

All of the above was discussed with Mr. J. B. Adams
who directed the following action be taken. Bureau (HQ and
Chicago Office) to respond to press inquiries on this
matter strictly, “no comment." Chicago Office to permit Cody
to read exactly what is in the SSC report (two paragraphs

. quoted above). It is Adams’ belief that onee Cody sees these
excerpts he will likely be less concerned. Most significant
on this point, and it should be specifically pointed out to Cody,
is the portion of Johnson's letter which states, "...he felt
certain that (Cody) will do everything possible to neutralize
King's effect in this area." This excerpt reveals that it was
Johnson's feeling that Cody.would neutralize King's effect and
jot an expressed statement by Cody on this point. Cody
will be told that Bureau's responses to any press inquiries will
be "no comment."' Also, Cody to be told that our files reveal
he did have a meeting with Johnson and that the 2/24/66 letter
reported the results thereof to FBIHQ, but that we are unable to
permit his seeing that letter. It should be tactfully pointed
out to Cody that by his not seeing the Johnson letter which would
refresh his memory, he would be in a better position in answering
any press inquiries, to be abhbe to truthfully claim "no
recollection." It should be made clear to Cody that.the FBI is not
advising him in any way as to whether or not he should answer
press inquiries and if he does, what he should say. ~

Deputy Assistant Director Boynton, External Affairs
Division, was briefed on this matter and advised of Mr. Adams
instructions as to "no comment" to press.

At 5:40 Dem, 5/5/76; writer telephonically contacted

ASAC Gray in Chicago and dictated to his secretary the two
pertinent paragraphs from the SSC report. Gray was then

PURPOSE: This is to advise of status of our review of 6

activities and observations concerning possible Bureau

SYNOPSTS: . In February, 1976, Director asked that we

gather material for possible response to the SSC report on

our security work. Date for issuance of report extended

from 3/15 to 4/30/76; Committee's life ends 5/31/76. Report
dealing primarily with FBI released 4/26/76; approximately a
15 separate supplements (Appendices) to be released this Der
month. INID is making detailed review of the Report and a
will do same with supplements. This being done by approxifiately
20 Supervisors having most expertise in specific areas.

They are pinpointing SSCs inaccuracies, distortions, slantings,
ete. Believed we should withhold decision on response to

SSC Report until after review of all of SSC's releases
(Appendices). Also to be noted is position expressed by CIA
Director Bush on release of SSC Report on CIA; namely, say

little and attempt to end public debate on U. S. intelligence,

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

DETAILS: The Director's memorandum to Messrs, Jenkins

and Moore 2/24/76, "Re: Senate Select Committee Report,"
directed that we then start gathering material for use

in any response we might make when the SSC releases its
report on the FBI's security work, such as press release or
similar action defending ourselves, The original date the
report was to be released was 3/15/76, but the SSC received
some date extensions, last one to 4/30/76. Life of the
Committee to cease 5/31/76. Memorandum from D. W. Moore, Jr.,
to Mr. Jenkins 3/16/76, "Senate Select Committee Report,"
advised of the INID review of the SSC's draft reports and
observed that it would be premature to prepare a public
statement at that time,

For the past two months we have been reviewing
drafts of various portions of the SSC report and its
appendices (exhibits, case studies, and the like) and, in

| addition to negotiating some changes and corrections in
these drafts with the SSC Staff, we have, where appropriate,
submitted memoranda to the Department, with copies for the
White House, containing our critique of the various drafts.
This has encompassed such matters as what we felt to be
distortions, slantings inaccuracies, reporting out of context,
and similar reporting abuses.

On 4/28/76, the SSC made public its Final Report
entitled 'Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans -
Book II," which deals primarily with the FBI - domestic
intelligence activities, (Book I dealt with foreign and
military intelligence matters, is primarily of concern to
CIA. and was released 4/26/76.) We immediately launched a
substantivé review effort of the Report in the INTD. This
involves approximately 20 Supervisors, Section Chiefs and
their Number One Men reviewing the portions of the Report

where they have the most expertise and responsibility.
This effort is presently under way and the personnel are
preparing material for consideration where they recognize
inaccuracies and other delinquencies in the Report. It
should be significantly noted, however, that during the
remaining life of the Committee this month, it will be
publishing approximately 15 separate documents in the form
of Appendices to the already-released Report. They will
cover such specific matters as Martin Luther King, Jr.,
investigation:,, COINTELPRO, electronic surveillances,
surreptitious entries and a variety of other subjects.

OBSERVATIONS: ‘It is believed that full consideration to any
response the Bureau may decide to make on the SSC's Report
(including Appendices) should not be given until after the
review of the some 15 Appendices due for release this month,
We will, of course, review each of these as we are reviewing
the basie Report, It should be of more than mild interest
to us that when Book I of the SSC Report relating primarily
to CIA was released, CIA Director George Bush was reported
as indicating that neither he nor his Agency would say

much about the report after it is released. Bush made clear
that one thing he wants is an end to the public debate over
U. S. intelligence ("Washington Star," 4/26/76, article by
Vernon A, Guidry, Jr.). Although Bush was apparently
speaking as head of the CIA, we should recognize that he

is also Director of Central Intelligence and thus his
thoughts should impact on the entire intelligence community,
including the FBI.

When all the reviews are completed, we will more
precisely address ourselves to the matter of possible response.
For your additional information, there is attached a statement
prepared by the External Affairs Division which it is using
to answer press inquiries on this matter,

findings can be informative and provide constructive assistance
to the Nation, to the Congress, to the Executive Branch, and
to the Government's intelligence agencies.

We need a balanced approach in fashioning today's
reforms and hopefully this report will help bring about such a
result. Rather than endless rumination over the past, we are
examining our activities precisely and will take corrective
action wherever warranted. We have guidelines now and aev hapa
more may be needed. At the same time, we must make certain
that the PBI's important functions are not impaired through
inattention. They can be maintained within a framework of
both fairness and efficiency.
i I have not read the entire report but I am doing so.
My review will not be directed toward uncovering errors or
misinterpretations of the thrust of the deliberations. I
intend to keep foremost not what is good for the FBI but what
is bgst for the Nation. Hopefully we can together assure that

both are served to make them mutually compatible.

RECOMMENDATION: None. For information.

DETAILS: Book 2 of the Final Keport of the SC, released 4/28/76,
sets forth the resuits of the Committee's investigation

Approximately one-fifth of the text of this Book discusses
or refers to the discontinued Cointelpros and emphasis is placed on
the programs targeting black extremists and the New Left, The
Report makes frequent reference to the "perceived threat" and
‘Umprecise targeting." Examples of particularly sensational
Cointelpro actions are used to illustrate alleged abuses in other areas,
and statements of former and present Bureau personnel regarding other
areas of our intelligence responsibilities are used to emphasize alleged
Cointelpre abuses.

Approximately 63 pages of the 341-page text deal with or
refer to Cointelpro, and the acronym is utilized in uppercase type
approximately 127 times. Pages 65-67, 86-89 and 211-219 detail

Memorandura to ui, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Cointelpros
62-116009

Under the title "Using Covert Action to Disrupt and Dis-
eredit Domestic Groups, ' a major finding of the Committce, "that
covert action programs have been used to disrupt the lawful political
activities of individual Avaericans and groups and to discredit them,
using dangerous and degrading tactics which are abhorrent in a free
and decent society, " the following findings are set forth:

a, Although the claimed purposes of the programs were
to protect national security and to prevent violence, many of the
victims were nonviolent, were not controlled by a foreign power and
posed no threat to national security.

b. The acts taken interfered with the First Amendment
rights of many citizens.

¢. The tactics used often risked and sometimes caused
serious emotional, econoraic, or physical damage. It is indicated
the sustained use of such tactics in an attempt to destroy
Dr. itartin Luther King, Jr., violated the law and fundamental
human decency. (Page 211)

Kecocamendation 40 (page 317) states the £31 should be
prohibited from (a) disseminating inforiaation ior improper purposes
(0) interfering with lawful speech, publication, assembly, organiza-
tional activity or association; and (c) harassing individuals through
unnecessary overt investigative techniques, it would appear the latter
is in support of past allegations of the SSC that our aggressive inves-
tigation in itself amounted to Cointelpro-type action,

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Cointelpros
62~116009

Recommendation 90 (page 336) indicates the Freedom of
Information and Federal Privacy Acts should continue to be vigorously
enforced and, in addition, recommends "the Department of Justice
should notify all readily identifiable targets of past iNegal surveil~
lance techniques, and all Cointelpro victims, and third parties who
had received anonymous Cointelpro communications, of the nature of
the activities directed against them, or the source of the anonymous
communications to them," It would appear this recommendation
would include other areas of past alleged abuse, as well as Cointelpro.
44so the inclusion of third parties is an expansion upon previous noli-
fication suggested,

Although the Final Report contains no «ew or surprise
allegations, the identification of targets by name, or of circumstances
which would enable ready identification, may be expected ta present
an increase in FOIA inquiries, For example, documents are fooi-
noted outlining Cointelpro actions directed against Leonard Boudin.
{attorney in the Elisberg case and currently in the Trotskyite suit)
and Dr. Benjarain Spock, former minority Presidential candidate
who in the past had been indicted for conspiring to violate the Selective
Service Act, (Page 246) Also references are set forth to original
FBI documents ond details set out regarding an action conducted
against "a Viidwest lawyer running for city council who was defeated
and who later ran successfully for a judgeship. Five FSI communi-+
cations to or from the Detroit Office are cited. (Page 248) Anyone
familiar with political or subversive activities in the Detroit area
would be readily able to identify the target in this instance as the
current iviayor of Detroit,

Also the following paragraph in the Washington Post:

In addition to the estimate of more than 200

has installed more than 500 bugs without warrant
since 1960 “against intelligence and internal
security targets," a technique which "the

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

DETAILS:

At 9:38 a.m. on April 23, 1976, George Tucker, formerly a
supervisor at Washington Field Office, now retired, whose address is
Post Office Box 246, Harwich Port, Massachusetts, 02646, telephone
number 617-432-3691, telephonically advised me that he had been contacted
by Mike Epstein of the Senate Select Committee, who asked him to be
available for an interview concerning a memorandum he had prepared
following an interview by Tucker on March_21,1967, of Ed Morgan.
Mr. Tucker told Epstein that he first desired to discuss this matter with
the Bureau and that Epstein should call him later during the day.

Mr. Tucker told me that he could recall having conducted the
interview of Ed Morgan and having prepared an FD 302, but he could not
recall the name of the Agent who accompanied him on the occasion of that
interview. He said he has no recollection of any information beyond that
which was recorded in the FD 302. Mr. Tucker asked whether he was
authorized to submit to an interview by Epstein.

Iadvised Mr. Tucker that the secrecy agreement which he
may have signed while an Agent of the Bureau was waived for purposes of an
interview that might be conducted by Epstein. However, I told Mr. Tucker
that the decision whether he would submit to an interview was entirely his.
I explained that the Bureau was cooperating with the Senate Select Committee
by waiving the secrecy agreements. I also explained that if Mr. Tucker
felt that he needed the assistance of counsel in such an interview, he could
request the appointment of counsel and his request would be forwarded to the
Department where such counsel would be provided. Mr. Tucker said that he
did not feel that it was necessary for him to have counsel as he recalls
his only participation in this matter was that he conducted an interview.

At 4:20 p.m. on April 23rd, Mr. Tucker called me again and
said that Epstein had called him to determine whether he would submit to an
interview and Tucker hdd refused. Epstein told him that the Committee might
issue a subpoena for Mr. Tucker to require his appearance and testimony at
which time his testimony would be taken under oath and made a matter of record.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

Tucker responded to Epstein by saying that he thought that his testimony
would be recorded anyway. He said that he explained to Epstein that he
had no knowledge beyond that which was recorded in the Bureau files
and he referred Epstein to the Bureau.

PURPOSE: To record comments of Senate Select Committee (sscy""**”’—
Staff Member explaining seemingly critical remark about FBI in
SSC report on foreign intelligence.

DETAILS: "The New York Times'4/27/76 printed portions of SSC

"final" report on foreign counterintelligence (CI), released by SSC
4/26/76 (copy attached). It included a statement that "recent
evidence suggests that F.B.I. counterespionage results have been

less than satisfactory." On 4/27/76, Supervisor J. P. Thomas,
Senstudy Project Unit, contacted John E1liff, Director of the SSC
Task Force on the FBI, called this statement to his attention and
asked whether this statement was based on any specific information
which the FBI could use to improve its counterespionage effectiveness.
E1Liff£ replied that he did not write this statement, but could say
that it was definitely not based on any specific FBI activity or
nonperformance; it was a reflection of testimony of past and present
CIA personnel; it related to past problems, mentioned in the
paragraph above the one quoted, which spoke of some old differences
between the FBI and CIA. It was also based, in part, on testimony of
former Assistant Director C, D. Brennan who said that, in his time,

a lower priority was given to CI matters than to domestic int (Ghee

Foreign Cannterinteiligence
Counterintelligence is defined quite
broadly by the C.LA. It includes the
knowledge needed for the protection
and preservation of the militezy, eco-
nome and productive strength of the
United States, as well as the Govern-
menv’s security in domestic and foreign
affairs, against or from espicnage,
sabotage and subversion designed lo
weaken or destroy the United States.
Counterinteiligence is a special form
aimed at dis-
intelligence

: operations and destroying their effec-

tiveness. Jt involves protecting the
United States Government against in-
tration by foreign agenis, as well as

4

55172 DocId:32989591

e

Page 68

controling and mnanipelating adversary
intelligence operations. An effort is
made to discern the plans and intentions
of enemy intelligence services and to
deceive them about our own.

The committee finds that the threat
from hostile intelligence services is real.
In the United States alone, well over
thousand Soviet officiais are on per
manent assignment. Among these, over
40 percent have been identified as mem-
bers of the KGB or GRU, the Sovict
civilian and military intefligence units,
respectively. Estimates’ for the number
of unidentified Soviet intelligence of-
ficers raise this figure to over 60 per-
cent and some -defector sources have
estimated that .70 percent to 80 percent

' of Soviet officials in the United States

have some intelligence connection.

Furthermore, the number of Sovicts
with access to the United States has
tripled since 1960, and is still increas-
ing. In 1974, for example, over 200
Soviet ships with a total crew comple-
ment of 13,000 officers and men visited
this country, Some 4,000 Soviets entered
the United States as commercial or ex-
chanee vi in 1974, In 1972-1973,
for era oproximaicly one-third of
the Soxiet exchange students here for
the academic year under the East-West
Student Exchange Program were co-
operaiing with the KGB, according to
the Central Intelligence Agency.

Other areas of counterintelligence
concern include the sharp increase in
the number of Soviet immigrants to the
United States (4,000 in 1974 compared
to fewer than 500 in i972): the rise in
East-West commercial exchange visitors
fi S41 in 1972 to 1,500 in 1974); and
the growing number of officials in this

\ country rom other Communist block

nations (from 416 in 1960 to 798 in
1975).
Coordination between CLA. and F.BI.
counterintelligence units is especially
al. The history of C.LA-FB.
liaison has been turbulent, though a
stvong undercurrent of cooperation ‘tas
usuaily existed at the staff level since
1952 when the bureau began sending a
mm person to the C.1.A. on a regular
basis. The sources of friclion between
the C.LA. and F.B.1. in the early days
revolved around such matters as the
frequent unwillingness of the bureau to
colicct positive intelligence for the C.LA,
within the United States or to help
recruit foreign officials in this country.
The committee believes that counter-
intelligence requires the direct attention
of Congress and the executive for three
reasons: (1) two inct and partly
incompatible approaches to counterin-
teliigence have emerged and demand
reconciliation; (2) recent evidence sug-
gests that F.B.1, counterespionage results

“ hawe been less than satisfactory; and

Dear Mike:

The Select Committee requests access.at FBI Head-
quarters to all summaries of information obtained from
electronic surveillance of Frank A. Capell and Robert
Manuel in 1965, which were disseminated by the FBI to
the White House and/or the Attorney General. This
request specifically encompasses, but is not limited to,
summaries which contain information pertaining to
attempts of the subjects to “smear or discredit high-
ranking Government officials" and summaries which
contain information pertaining to a book then being
written about the President. This type of information
is referred to in a memorandum from Mr. R. D. Cotter
to’ Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated November 3, 1965,
captioned: "Frank A. Capell -- Espionage-x." |

Sincerely yours,

PURPOSE: This informative memorandum advises of |
negotiations with Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff
resulting in radical change. in its draft report on
Martin Luther King, Jr., which was to contain a highly
erroneous statement adverse to the Bureau,

SYNOPSIS: Draft of SSC report on King contained statement:
"The Committee, to avoid furthering the violations of

privacy already perpetuated by the Bureau, has a

ye be

the FBI to excise from all documents submitted to the
Committee any reference to Dr, King's personal life."
This is highly inaccurate and in SSC's effort to appear
sanctimonious, it twisted facts to reflect adversely on
Bureau. On our condemnation of the statement, SSC changed
draft to read: "The Committee did not investigate

Dr, King's personal life, The issue is raised here only
because it apparently played some part in forming the
attitudes of certain FBI officials towards Dr. King.
Moreover, in order to preclude further dissemination, the
Committee requested that the FBI excise from all documents
any information obtained as a result of an electronic
surveillance of Dr. King.'' The revision thus eliminated
inaccuracies and aaa the reflection on the

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

DETAILS: SSC's final draft of its "Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Case Study" contained a statement, "The Committee, to

avoid furthering the violations of privacy already perpet-
tated. by the Bureau, has requested the FBI to excise from
all documents submitted to the Committee any reference to
Dr. King's personal life," On review, writer noted
statement's inaccuracy. SSC did not ask us to excise from
documents furnished it information as to King's personal
life. Only information we were asked to excise was that.
from electronic surveillances (elsurs) on King with no
mention made by SSC as to content of products of elsurs,

We followed such SSC stipulation as religiously as possible,
Most significantly, we did furnish documents containing
"personal life" data on King when the documents were
responsive to SSC requests and the information was not a
product of King elsurs. Review also highlighted SSC's
Sanctimony in accusing Bureau of violating King's privacy
whereas SSC avoided same.

In reviewing the many drafts of SSC's reports
to soon be published; we have by prearrangements addressed
ourselves back to the SSC concerning changes involving
only classification and privacy of Bureau personnel problems
and generally not concerning its warped presentations,
editorializing, slanting and other similar objectionable
features, These latter-type situations are being included
in letterhead memoranda which we are furnishing to the
Department and White House.

In the instance cited above, it was decided,
after writer conferred with Deputy Assistant Director W. 0.
Cregar, that it would be in the Bureau's best interest if
we could negotiate with the SSC to make changes which would
correct the statement and at the same time remove the

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75

adverse reflection on the Bureau. In arriving at this
decision, we recognize that, if the statement was reported
as is, we could counter it in a manner which would not
only set the record straight but also make look foolish
the SSC for its inaccuracy, However, we all recdgnize
that a "denial," "correction," or the like never quite
catches up with the original statement nor has near the
impact of the original statement. This is especially true
when one must depend on our media for "corrections," In
this light, therefore, decision to attempt to have statement
changed was Launched,

On 4/20/76, writer discussed matter with SSC
Staff Member Thomas Dawson at which time it was determined
that, since we had last seen the draft, there had been
added at the very end of the challenged statement:
", acquired through electronic surveillance of King,"
While the addition of this phrase made the original statement
more complete, it did not lessen in any way the basic
objectionable features of the statement, Dawson was told
fully and candidly why we objected to the statement, He
was shown several SSC reqiéSts which make it clear we were
asked to excise as to source (elsurs on King) not as to
content (private activities of King). He was also told of
instances where we had furnished the SSC documents with
private life information when the documents were responsive
to SSC requests and data therein did not originate with
King elsurs. Dawson appeared to accept our arguments and
said he would check back with the SSC Staff and advise,

Dawson telephoned on 4/21/76 and offered to
replace the original statement with one reading as follows:
"The Committee did not investigate Dr, King's personal life,

some part in forming the attitudes of certain FBI officials
towards Dr, King. Moreover, in order to preclude further
dissemination, the Committee insisted that the FBI excise
from all requested documents any information obtained as

a result of an electronic surveillance of Dr. King." He

was told that the change was a vast improvement over the
original version in that it was no longer an erroneous
statement and also eliminated the SSC's sanctimony which

was also unfavorable to the Bureau. It was pointed out,
however, that the statement in its revised version did not
track, and it was suggested for it to have meaning there
needed to be added at the end something such as is indi-~
cated by the underlined portion as follows: ". .. any
information obtained as a result of an electronic surveillance
of Dr. King, inasmuch as such electronic surveillances
produced information on King's personal life." Dawson was also
told that the use of the word "insisted," though a minor
matter, was viewed as not accurately describing the situation.
The SSC had "asked" or "requested" the excisions, not
insisted we make them, Dawson agreed to change "insisted"

to '"requested.'"'- However, after conferring with the SSC
Staff, he declined to add anything as suggested, No further
effort was made to urge him on the matter of the addition

we suggested as it was believed that the essential point

had been made; namely, change statement so it was no longer
inaccurate or adverse to the Bureau,

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination of the Department, was kept up
to date of our actions in this matter, He fully agreed
with our objections and the efforts we made to effect the
changes,

The Attorney General

As I indicated in my previous memoranda I
consider this disclosure of an FBI informant allegedly by the
SSG and now by Senator Morgan a most serious breach of the
confidentiality that must be afforded the material and
information that this Bureau has furnished te the ssc.
It is noted that Mr. Dorsett experienced harassment following
the December, 1975, disclosures concerning his informant
relationship with the FBI. It is felt that Senator Morgan's
present disclosure creates a very real danger of further
harassment and possible physical harm to Mir. Dorsett or
members of his family. This situation would prevail in the
event of the disclosure of any informant. It is
respectfully requested that this matter be brought
to the attention of Senator Church, the Chairman of this
committee. It is neted that Dorsett's identity as an
informant has not been publicly acknowledged either by
Dorsett or this Bureau.

Please advise what action is taken concerning
this matter.

He also cited the FBI's writing of an- ”

Qn Harch 22 and 23, 1976, representatives of ‘this
Bureau reviewed the SSC"s draft report entitled “Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jc., Case Study." The purpose of the review was to
recognize and bring to the attention of the §SC Staff any
information the FRE believes to be classified or otherwise
sensitive to the extent that it should not be made public, as
well as the identities of any FBI personnel below the vank of
Section Chief which, by prior ement. between the SSC and
the FBI, would not be included in the report.

Set forth below are the instances noted where
deletions or changes are suggested. An enumeration of thesa
instances was informally furnished to Mr. Dan Mccorkle of the
SSC Staff on March 23, 1976. ;

There were also noted during the review several
instances where names of individuals (or descriptive information
identifying individuals) were set forth. As it was our under-
standing that the SSC did not intend to include such names in the
report for reasons of privacy and as it appeared such inclusion
may have been inadvertent, the specific instances of reference
were orally brought to the attertion of Mr. Thomas Dawson of the
SSC Staff on March 22, 1976.

Moore to Jenkins Memorandum
Re: Information Obtained by "New York Times"

DETAILS

John Crewdson, reporter, "New York Times," contacted a
representative of this Division on 4/20/76 to advise that the
"New York Times" had obtained information which was to be disclosed
in the forthcoming report of the Senate Select Committee (Church
Committee). Crewdson advised that the "New York Times" was
planning to publish this information within the next several days
and desired to inform the FBI of the information that it had in
order that the FBI might either respond to this information or
provide the "New York Times" with guidance in the event some of
the information was not accurate.

The following items were provided by Crewdson, all of
which reportedly come from the soon to be released Church Com-
mittee report.

1) That during the period 1958 to 1966 Congressman John
Rooney of the House Appropriations Committee was continuously
informed in detail by the late Director Hoover and other officials
regarding COINTEL operations directed against the Communist Party
and the Ku Klux Klan. Rooney, as well as other members of the
Subcommittee, knew more about the FBI's COINTEL operations than
Attorneys General.

2) That the 14 "bugs" that were installed in the hotel
and motel rooms of Dr. Martin Luther King during his travels were
for the purpose of obtaining information on his personal life and
were not installed to ascertain his degree of affiliation with the
Communist Party.

3) That the Church Committee was furnished names of FBI
informants in the news media. While the identity of these informants
was disclosed to the Church Committee the FBI through the Attorney
General prevented the Church Committee from interviewing these
individuals and also restricted the disclosing of their identities
by the Church Committee.

Moore to Jenkins Memorandum
Re: Information Obtained by "New York Times"

Crewdson advised that the identities of the individuals
referred to are as follows:

Peter Khiss, New York Times

Jerry O'Leary, Washington Star

Edward Montgomery, San Francisco Examiner
George Putnam, Los Angeles TV news announcer
Theo Wilson, New York Daily News

“Fulton Lewis, Jr.

Jimmy Ward, Jackson, Mississippi, newsman
Shirley Uhl, UPI, Pittsburgh

Ralph McGill, Atlantic Constitution

Name unknown - news director, Channel 7, Miami

4) The FBI maintained a network of sources in educational
institutions, as well as in nonprofit foundations. Richard Larry
of the Mellon Foundation in Pittsburgh was one of these sources who.
did several favors for the FBI by dismissing individuals in the
Foundation that the FBI disliked and withheld funds that the
Foundation was providing to organizations that the FBI disliked.

5) That the wiretap which the late Congressman Hale Boggs
claimed to be installed on his telephone by the FBI was actually
placed on his telephone by his wife (now Congresswoman Lindy Boggs)
who believed that Boggs had a girlfriend in Alexandria. This wire-
tap was placed by a private detective and the details concerning
this matter came to the attention of the FBI.

The Church Committee report is scheduled to be released
sometime toward the end of April. It is obvious that someone who
has knowledge of the contents of that report is disclosing infor-
mation to the "New York Times." Inasmuch as the report has not
been made public it would be most inappropriate for the Bureau to
comment on the information obtained by the "New York Times" or
authenticate the veracity of the information set forth above.
