It is noted the Cardinal was released from the

hospital on 5/5/76 where he had been recovering from the

removal of his gall bladder.

SA HART has been the liaison

between the Chicago Office and the Cardinal since 1966

and has developed a

friendly personal working relationship

with him.

Attached as the last page of this airtel is a

copy of an article which appeared in the 5.6/76 edition

of the Chicago Daily News.

In view of the quality of the

xeroxing the last sentences at

the bottom of the first two

columns are repeated hereafter:

Column 1

"Cardinal Cody is convalescing in Chicago's

Columbus Hospital after April 25 gall bladder surgery

and couldn't be reached directly for comment, but a

spokesman for the archdiocese quoted the Cardinal as

saying the committee's report is "absolutely untrue.'"

Column 2

"Wednesday to accompany its monumental two

volumes released last week on the nation's domestic and

foreign intelligence operations.

"The supplement is the second of 13 such

volumes of detail on the committee's schedule."

Dear Mr. Levi:

I would like to thank you for the courtesy you extended

by promptly responding to my request to see you.

Your action

exemplified the

spirit of cooperation between the Executive

and Congress which prompted my request.

I do feel that my concern that the FBI clear for release

the documents with which I was concerned deserves your seri-

ous attention.

While I am aware that the release of the docu

ments may confirm the identity of a former FBI informant, I

feel the posture the Bureau has taken in publicly denying that

the events described in the documents ever took place neces-

sitates their release, if only to set the record straight. It

should be noted that the Bureau's public position in this situ-

ation,

as well as in others, has been taken in direct response

to public statements I have

made critical of past improper FBI

activities. Accordingly, it is the confirmation of improper

which I am concerned. Further, it is my feeling that,

FBI activity, instead of the identity of the informant, ased

on information I have received, the identity of the informant

is already common knowledge.

The other group of documents for which I sought release

concern FBI actions taken against the Black Panther Party in

North Carolina.

These in no way involve a confidential source,

and I anticipate no problems with their clearance.

Under sep-

arate cover I

am furnishing Mr. Steve Blackhurst copies of the

documents for which I seek clearance.

Again, let me express my appreciation to you for your as-

sistance in

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

DETAILS: An Appendix to the SSC's Final Report on the

FBI's domestic intelligence work, entitled "Dr. Martin Luther

King, JI., Case Study," was publicly released 5/5/76. On

page 146 appears information concerning the FBI's attempt

to determine the validity of an allegation in 1965 that

King had a numbered account in a foreign bank with a balance

of over $1,000,000. The information, as reported by the

SSC, indicates that the allegation was received by the

King case supervisor (writer) at the time and that he conceived

the plan to check out the allegation. Four footnotes

relating to this information (#289-292) appear at the bottom.

of page 146. Three of the footnotes identify specific FBI

documents, copies of which we had furnished to the SSC.

One of the footnotes, #289, states, "If should be noted

that the Supervisor in charge of the King case is still in

a high position with the FBI and handled the committee's

documents requests in the King case investigation."

The 5/6/76 issue of the "Los Angles Times" contains

an article on page 1 headed,

"FBI Supervisor Who Sought to

Discredit King Still There." (Attached to the original

and to each copy of this memorandum is a Xerox of the article.

The article reports rather fully the information on this

matter contained on page 146 and quotes almost in its

entirety the footnote quoted above. The article outlines

the author's (writer not identified in article but believed

to principally be Ron Ostrow) efforts to identify the

supervisor in charge of the King case and includes his

contacts with the SSC and Assistant Attorney General

J. Stanley Pottinger. It appears that the author's interest

prompting such a highlighted story stems from anearlier-

released statement by Pottinger that "the top nine persons

responsible for the FBI Campaign all are either dead or

retired." When this statement of Pottinger is compared with

the footnote quoted above, the inconsistency is glaring.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

This memorandum and the recommended action is

prompted by a deep concern of the writer for his own

personal safety.

Without being theatrical or exaggerating,

the writer recognizes that walking the streets today are

individuals mentally or otherwise so affected that they

might attempt some act of violence in what they would

consider retaliation for the death of a martyred hero.

While this is

a personal concern, there is an obvious

simultaneous impact on the Bureau should anything impair

the safety of the writer. While the writer's name is not

yet a matter of public record, it is certainly not unlikely

that the footnote in question will serve as the springboard

for such media or other investigation which will finally

result in an exposure of the writer, by name, as the King

case supervisor.

Two principal derelictions on the part of the

SSC are noted in relation to this matter. (1) The statement

that the writer is in a high position with the FBI is an

absolute falsehood. At the time the writer assumed

supervision of the King case, he held the lowest ranking

Special Agent position at FBIHQ, that of a Supervisor.

During the supervision of that case, he was elevated to

the position of Unit Chief and has never risen above that

position since supervising the King case. Significantly,

of nine position ranks at FBIHQ, from the Director to a

Supervisor, the Unit Chief is the next to lowest rank.

(2) By agreements between the SSC, the Department and the

Bureau, we were permitted to review drafts of the SSC's

reports so that we might call to its notice necessary changes

relating to classification, sensitivity of material, and

identities of personnel below rank of Section Chief. When

the draft of this Appendix was reviewed by the writer,

Re:

it did not contain the quoted footnote. Not only is

there considerable question as to the validity of the

quoted portion as a footnote rather than as being included

in the details of the material, but its mere post-review

addition raises considerable questions.

The writer hesitates to become accusatory as to

motive but is hard put to be dissuaded from belief that

this addition of the footnote was a deliberate act with

intention to eventual public uncovering of the writer's

name. The SSC has been furnished documents and the

writer, upon interview by the SSC Staff, furnished infor-

mation fully revealing of the positions

which the writer

has held in the Bureau since his supervision of the King

case. In short, the SSC knows full well that the claim

that the writer

is in a high position is a falsehood.

As the Director and other Bureau officials are

aware, an abuse by the SSC is nothing new to us.

The

Department is also similarly aware. The current instance

is just the latest of many SSC abuses and, notwithstanding

the writer's personal feelings and involvement, he must

consider this as an extreme abuse.

I am, therefore, requesting that the Bureau,

through the Department, personally bring this matter to attention of

Senator Church and make crystal clear to him that the

Bureau, and I personally, consider this action by the SSC

with deep concern, dismay and that the Bureau and I

protest the SSC's action. Under normal circumstances, as

head of our Senstudy 75 Project, I would handle this aspect

insofar as necessary correspondence and arrangements are

concerned. However, for obvious personal considerations,

I believe this should be handled by our Legal Counsel

Division.

The purpose of this memorandum is to record contact with

Ron Ostrow, reporter for the "Los Angeles Times," and his agreement

to not pursue the identity of the FBI Supervisor mentioned in his

article of 5/6/76.

DETAILS

On the evening of 5/5/76 Ron Ostrow, reporter for the

"Los Angeles Times," contacted Deputy Assistant Director Homer

Boynton of the External Affairs Division. Ostrow stated that the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) case study

on DI. Martin Luther King,

page 146, Lootnote 1289, indicates that "the supervisor in charge

of the King case is still in a high position with the FBI and

handled the Committee's documents request in the King case investi-

gation." Ostrow stated that this statement appeared to contradict

the comments of Assistant Attorney General J. Stanley Pottinger who

ART TAHORITAIION (

HARRIN IS UNCLASSITIL

DATE

indicated approximately one week ago that the top 9 persons respon-

sible for the FBI campaign against Dr. King were all either dead

or retired.

Ostrow was advised that the individual alluded to in the

report was not a high official of the FBI and in the order of rank

of investigative employees at FBIHQ was near the bottom. Ostrow was

informed that this gentlemen in no way had anything to do with

policy-making or direction of activities against Dr. King.

Ostrow

stated that he was most anxious to determine the identity of this

individual and had been in contact with Mr. Pottinger at the

Department of Justice.

Subsequent to the release of the article (attached) on

5/6/76 Mr. Seymor Phillips and Mr. Boynton met with the Director

the possibility that a deranged or warped-minded individual

might decide to make amends for what might be considered to

be an affront to Dr. King and attempt to do bodily harm to

Bureau employees responsible for these actions. The Director

agreed with this assessment of the problem and instructed that

Boynton contact Ostrow and ask him if he would be willing to desist

in his efforts to identity the FBI Supervisor.

On the afternoon of 5/6/76 Boynton met with Ron Ostrow

and conveyed the aforementioned concerns. Ostrow indicated that

he did not intend to pursue this matter any further unless he

received pressure to do so, in which case he would immediately

notify Boynton. In accordance with the Director's instructions,

if Ostrow is to proceed further, consideration will be given to

contacting higher level officials at the "Los Angeles Times" up

to and including the publisher in order to protect the identity

of Mr. Seymor Phillips in this matter.

our security work.

Date for issuance of report extended

from 3/15 to 4/30/76; Committee's life ends 5/31/76. Report

dealing primarily with FBI released 4/26/76; approximately

15 separate supplements (Appendices) to be released this

month. INTD is making detailed review of the Report and

will do same with supplements. This being done by approximately

20 Supervisors having most expertise in specific areas.

They are pinpointing SS's inaccuracies, distortions, slantings,

etc. Believed we should withhold decision on response to

SSC Report until after review of all of SSC's releases

(Appendices). Also to be noted is position expressed by CIA

Director Bush on release of SSC Report on CIA; namely, say

little and attempt to end public debate on U. S. intelligence.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

DETAILS: The Director's memorandum to Messrs. Jenkins

and Moore 2/24/76, "Re:

Senate Select Committee Report,"

directed that we then start gathering material for use

in any response we might make when the SSC releases its

report on the FBI's security work, such as press release or

similar action defending ourselves. The original date the

report was to be released was 3/15/76, but the SSC received

some date extensions, last one to 4/30/76. Life of the

advised of the INTD review of the SSC's draft reports and

observed that it would be premature to prepare a public

statement at that time.

For the past two months we have been reviewing

drafts of various portions of the SSC report

and its

appendices (exhibits, case studies, and the like) and, in

addition to negotiating some changes and corrections in

these drafts with the SSC Staff, we have, where appropriate,

submitted memoranda to the Department, with copies for the

White House, containing our critique of the various drafts.

This has encompassed such matters as what we felt to be

distortions, slantings inaccuracies, reporting out of context,

and similar reporting abuses.

On 4/28/76, the SSC made public its Final Report

entitled "Intelligence Activities and the Rights of Americans -

Book II," which deals primarily with the FBI - domestic

intelligence activities.

(Book I dealt with foreign and

military intelligence matters, is primarily of concern to

CIA and was released 4/26/76.) We immediately launched a

substantivé review effort of the Report in the INTD. This

should be significantly noted, however, that during the

remaining life of the Committee this month, it will be

publishing approximately 15 separate documents in the form

of Appendices to the already-released Report. They will

cover such specific matters as Martin Luther King, Jx.,

investigation,: COINTELPRO, electronic surveillances,

surreptitious entries and a variety of other subjects.

OBSERVATIONS: It is believed that full consideration to any

response the Bureau may decide to make on the SSC's Report

(including Appendices) should not be given until after the

review of the some 15 Appendices due for release this month.

We will, of course, review each of these as we are reviewing

the basie Report.

It should be of more than mild interest

to us that when Book I of the SSC Report relating primarily

to CIA was released, CIA Director George Bush was reported

as indicating that neither he nor his Agency would say

much about the report after it is released. Bush made clear

that intelling hee antashing to, ella debate ver

Vernon A. Guidry, Jr.): Although Bush was apparently

speaking as head of the CIA, we should recognize that he

is also Director of Central

Intelligence and thus his

thoughts should impact on the entire intelligence community,

including the FBI.

When all the reviews are completed, we will more

precisely address ourselves to the matter of possible response.

For your additional information, there is attached a statement

prepared by the External Affairs Division which it is using

to answer press inquiries on this matter.

findings can be informative and provide constructive assistance

to the Nation, to the Congress, to

the Executive Branch, and

to the Government's intelligence agencies.

We need a balanced approach in fashioning today's

reforms and hopefully this report will help bring about such a

result. Rather than endless rumination over the past, we are

examining our activities precisely and will take corrective

action wherever warranted. We have guidelines now and perhaps.

more may be needed. At the same time, we must make certain

that the FBI's important functions are not impaired through

inattention. They can be maintained within a

framework of

both fairness and efficiency.

I have not read the entire report but I am doing so.

My review will not be directed toward uncovering errors or

misinterpretations of the thrust of the deliberations. I

intend to keep foremost not what is good for the FBI but what

is best for the Nation.. Hopefully we can together assure that

both are served to make them mutually compatible.

(Cointelpros), as set forth in the Final Report of the Senate Select

Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelli-

Re: Cointelpros

62-116009

ELCONVENDATION: None. For information.

DETAILS: Book 2 of the Final Report of the SSC, released 4/28/76,

sets forth the results of the Committee's investigation

into Federal domestic intelligence activities.

Approximately one-fifth of the text of this Book discusses

or refers to the discontinued Cointelpros and emphasis is placed on

the programs targeting black extremists and the New Left. The

Report makes frequent reference to the "perceived threat" and

'Imprecise targeting. " Examples of particularly sensational

Cointelpro actions are used to illustrate alleged abuses in other areas,

and statements of former and present Bureau personnel regarding other

areas of our intelligence responsibilities are used to emphasize alleged

Cointelpro abuses.

Approximately 63 pages of the 341-page text deal with or

refer to Cointelpro, and the acronym is utilized in uppercase type

approximately 127 times. Pages 65-67, 86-89 and 211-219 detail

Cointelpro activities.

Memorandum to vir. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Cointelpros

62-116009

Under the title "Using Covert Action to Disrupt and Dis-

credit Domestic Groups, " a major finding of the Committce, "that

covert action programs have been used to disrupt the lawful political

activities of individual Americans and groups and to discredit them,

using dangerous and degrading tactics which are abhorrent in a free

and decent society, " the following findings are set forth:

a. Although the claimed purposes of the programs were

to protect national security and to prevent violence, many of the

victims were nonviolent, were not controlled by a foreign power and

posed no threat to national security.

i. The acts taken interfered with the First Amendment

rights of many citizens.

c. The tactics used often risked and sometimes caused

serious emotional, econoraic, or physical damage. It is indicated

the sustained use of such tactics in an attempt to destroy

Dr. iartin Luther Ising, Jr., violated the law and fundamental

human decency. (Page 211)

Recommendation 40 (page 317) states the f3l should be

prohibited from (a) disseminating information for improper purposes;

(b) interfering with lawiul speech, publication, assembly, organiza-

tional activity or association; and (c) harassing individuals through

unnecessary overt investigative techniques. It would appear the latter

is in support of past allegations of the SSC that our ageressive inves-

tigation in itself amounted to Cointelpro-type action.

Memorandum to Vir. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Cointelpros

62-116009

Fecommendation 90 (page 336) indicates the Freedom of

Information and Federal Privacy Acts should continue to be vigorously

enforced and, in addition, recommends "the Department of Justice

should notify all readily identifiable targets of past illegal surveil-

lance techniques, and all Cointelpro victims, and third parties who

had received anonymous Cointelpro communications, of the nature of

the activities directed against them, or the source of the anonymous

communications to them." It would appear this reco mendation

would include other areas of past alleged abuse, as well as Cointelpro.

Also the inclusion of third parties is an expansion upon previous noti-

fication suggested.

Although the Final Report contains no new or surprise

allegations, the identification of targets by name, or of circumstances

which would enable ready identification, may be expected to present

an increase in FOlA inquiries. For example, documents are foot-

noted outlining Cointelpro actions directed against Leonard Boudin

(attorney in the Ellsberg case and currently in the Trotskyite suit)

and Dr. Benjamin Spock, former minority Presidential candidate

who in the past had been indicted for conspiring to violate the Selective

Service Act. (Page 246) Also references are set forth to original

FBI documents and details set out regarding an action conducted

against "a Midwest lawyer running for city council" who was defeated

and who later ran successfully for a judgeship. Five FBI communi-

cations to or from the Detroit Office are cited. (Page 248) Anyone

familiar with political or subversive activities in the Detroit area

would be readily able to identily the target in this instance as the

current Mayor of Detroit.

I note the following paragraph in the New York Times for

today:

Also

The committee staff also reported that the

bureau had made at least 491 surreptitious

entries between 1960 and 1975 to install

listening devices in the homes or offices

of criminal suspects, and that 509 microphones

had been surreptitiously installed by the

bureau in domestic intelligence cases during

the same period.

the following paragraph in the Washington Post:

In addition to the estimate of more than 200

"black bag jobs," the report said the FBI

has installed more than 500 bugs without warrant

since 1960 "against intelligence and internal

security targets,"

a technique which "the

Justice Department still permits."

These paragraphs give the impression that entries without

a warrant are still being made or are still "permitted"

for internal security targets.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

DETAILS:

At 9:38 a.m. on April 23, 1976, George Tucker, formerly a

supervisor at Washington Field Office, now retired, whose address is

Post Office Box 246, Harwich Port, Massachusetts, 02646, telephone

number 617-432-3691, telephonically advised me that he had been contacted

by Mike Epstein of the Senate Select Committee, who asked him to be

available for an interview concerning a memorandum he had prepared

following an interview by Tucker on March 21, 1967, of Ed Morgan.

Mr. Tucker told Epstein that he first desired to discuss this matter with

the Bureau and that Epstein should call him later during the day.

Mr. Tucker told me that he could recall having conducted the

interview of Ed Morgan and having prepared an FD 302, but he could not

recall the name of the Agent who accompanied him on the occasion of that

interview. He said he has no recollection of any information beyond that

which was recorded in the FD 302. Mr. Tucker asked whether he was

authorized to submit to an interview by Epstein.

I advised Mr. Tucker that the secrecy agreement which he

may have signed while an Agent of the Bureau was waived for purposes of an

interview that might be conducted by Epstein. However, I told Mr. Tucker

that the decision whether he would submit to an interview was entirely his.

I explained that the Bureau was cooperating with the Senate Select Committee

by waiving the secrecy agreements. I also explained that if Mr. Tucker

felt that he needed the assistance of counsel in such an interview, he could

request the appointment of counsel and his request would be forwarded to the

Department where such counsel would be provided. Mr. Tucker said that he

did not feel that it was necessary for him to have counsel as he recalls

his only participation in this matter was that he conducted an interview.

At 4:20 p.m. on April 23rd, Mr. Tucker called me again and

said that Epstein had called him to determine whether he would submit to an

interview and Tucker had refused. Epstein told him that the Committee might

issue a subpoena for Mr. Tucker to require his appearance and testimony at

which time his testimony would be taken under oath and made a matter of record.

SSC report on foreign intelligence.

DETAILS: "The New York Times"4/27/76 printed portions of SSC

"final" report on foreign counterintelligence (CI), released by SSC

4/26/76 (copy attached).

It included a statement that "recent

evidence suggests that F.B.I. counterespionage results have been

less than satisfactory."

On 4/27/76, Supervisor J. P. Thomas,

Senstudy Project Unit, contacted John Elliff, Director of the

• SSC

Task Force on the FBI, called this statement

to his attention and

asked whether this statement was based on any specific information

which the FBI could use to improve its counterespionage effectiveness.

Elliff replied that he did not write this statement, but could say

that it was definitely not based on any specific FBI activity or

nonperformance; it was a reflection of testimony of past and present

CIA personnel; it related to past problems, mentioned in the

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINE

paragraph above the one quoted, which spoke of some old differences

between the FBI and CIA.

It was also based, in part, on testimony of

placed on CI training, etc. Elliff added "informally" that we should

recognize that there was a conflict within the SSC between the group

working with CIA, which naturally expressed pro-CIA sentiments to

the detriment of CIA's "opposition"' and those, such as Elliff, who

have more knowledge of FBI accomplishments; the report is

necessarily a compromise between these two groups.

PURPOSE: This informative memorandum advises of

negotiations with Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff

resulting in radical change, in its draft report on

Martin Luther King, JI., which was to contain a highly

erroneous statement adverse to the Bureau.

$ GMAY Boc19762989591

SYNOPS IS :

Draft of SSC repott on King contained statement:

"The Committee, to avoid furthering the violations of

privacy already perpetuated by the Bureau, has requested

the FBI to excise from all documents submitted to the

Committee any reference to Dr. King's personal life."

This is highly inaccurate and in SSC's effort to appear

sanctimonious, it twisted facts to reflect adversely on

Bureau.

On our condemnation of the statement, SSC changed

draft to read: "The Committee did not investigate

DI. King's personal life. The issue is raised here only

because it apparently played some part in forming the

attitudes of certain FBI officials towards DI. King.

UNRECORDED COPY FILED IN

100-106

Moreover, in order to preclude further dissemination, the

Committee requested that the FBI excise from all documents

any information obtained as a result of an electronic

surveillance of: Dr. King." The revision thus eliminated

inaccuracles and removed the ax 95 RECta2 -1 12 3 75-

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

DETAILS: SSC's final draft of its "Martin Luther King, JI.,

Case Study" contained a statement,

"The Committee, to

avoid furthering the violations of privacy already perpet-

uated by the Bureau, has requested the FBI to excise from

all documents submitted to the Committee any reference to

Dr. King's personal life." On review, writer noted

statement's inaccuracy. SSC did not ask us to excise from

documents furnished it information as to King's personal

life. Only information we were asked to excise was that.

from electronic surveillances (elsurs) on King with no

mention made by SSC as to content of products of elsurs.

We followed such SSC stipulation as religiously as possible.

Most significantly, we did furnish documents containing

"personal life" data on King when the documents were

responsive to SSC requests and the information was not

product of King elsurs. Review also highlighted SSC's

sanctimony in accusing

¡ Bureau of violating King's privacy

whereas SSC avoided same.

In reviewing the many drafts of SSC's reports

to soon be published, we have by prearrangements addressed

ourselves back to the SSC concerning changes involving

only classification and privacy of Bureau personnel problems

and generally not concerning its warped presentations,

editorializing, slanting and other similar objectionable

features.

These latter-type situations are being included

in letterhead memoranda which we are furnishing to the

Department and White House.

In the instance cited above, it was decided,

after writer conferred with Deputy Assistant Director W. O.

Gregar, that it would be in the Bureau's best interest if

we could negotiate with the SSC to make changes which would

correct the statement and at the same time remove the

Re:

adverse reflection on the Bureau. In arriving at this

decision, we recognize that, if the statement was reported

as is, we could counter it in a manner which would not

only set the record straight but also make look foolish

the SSC for its inaccuracy. However, we all recognize

that a "denial," "correction," or the like never quite

catches up with the original

statement nor has near the

impact of the original statement. This is especially true

when one must depend on our media for "corrections." In

this light, therefore, decision to attempt to have statement

changed was launched.

On 4/20/76, writer discussed matter with SSC

Staff Member Thomas Dawson at which time it was determined

that, since we had last seen the draft, there had been

added at the very end of the challenged statement:

", acquired through electronic surveillance of King."

While the addition of this phrase made the original

statement

more complete, it did not lessen in any way the basic

objectionable features of the statement. Dawson was told

fully and candidly why we objected to the statement. He

was shown several SSC requests which make it clear we were

asked to excise as to source (elsurs on King) not as to

content (private activities of King). He was also told of

instances where we had furnished the SSC documents with

private life information when the documents were responsive

to SSC requests and data therein did not originate with

Dawson telephoned on 4/21/76 and offered to

replace the original

statement with one reading as follows:

some part in forming the attitudes of certain FBI officials

owards Dr. King. Moreover,, in order to preclude further

dissemination, the Committee insisted that the FBI excise

from all requested documents any information obtained as

a result of an electronic surveillance of Dr. King." He

was told that the change was a vast improvement over the

original version in that it was no longer an erroneous

statement and also eliminated the SSC's sanctimony which

was also unfavorable to the Bureau.

It was pointed out,

however, that the statement in its revised version did not

track, and it was suggested for it to have meaning there

needed to be added at the end something such as is indi-

cated by the underlined portion as follows: "

• • any

information obtained as a result of an electronic surveillance

of Dr. King, inasmuch as such electronic surveillances

produced information on King's personal life." Dawson was also

told that the use of the word "insisted," though a minor

matter,

was viewed as not accurately describing the situation.

The SSC had "asked" or "requested" the excisions, not

insisted we make them. Dawson agreed to change "insisted"

to "requested.". However, after conferring with the SSC

Staff, he declined to add anything as suggested. No further

effort was made to urge him on the matter of the addition

we suggested as it was believed that the essential point

had been made; namely, change statement so it was no longer

inaccurate or adverse to the Bureau.

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination of the Department, was kept up

to date of our actions in this matter. He fully agreed

with our objections and the efforts we made to effect the

changes.

As I indicated in my previous memoranda I

consider this disclosure of an FSI informant allegedly by the

SSC and now by Senator Morgan a most serious breach of the

confidentiality that must be afforded the material and

infornation that this Bureau has furnished to the SSC.

It is noted that Nr. Dorsett experienced harassment following

the December, 1975, disclosures conceming his infornant

relationship with the FBI. It is felt that Senator logan's

present disclosuce creates a very real danger of further

harassment and possible physical harm to lix. Dorsett or

members of his family.

This situation would prevail in the

event of the disclosure of any informant. It is

respectfully requested that this matter be brought

to the attention of Senator Church, the Chairman of this

committee.

It is noted that Dorsett's identity as an

informant has not becn publicly acknowledged either by

Dorsett or this Bureau.

Please advise what action is taken concerning

this matter.

Morgan Confirms

Spy Within KKK

ot

CREENSBORO DAILY NEWS

Greensboro, N. C.

BY JACK BETTS

Dally News Staff Writer

Sen., Robert Morgan, D-N:C., has pub-

icly identified a Greensboro man as a

paid informant on the Ku Klux Klan for

the Federal Bureau of Investigation dur-

ling the FBI's campaign of intiltrating

left-and-right-wing, hate groups during

the later Sixties. •.

In remarks prepared for delivery Sat-

urday night in Winston-Salem, Morgan

identified the man as

"the Rev. Mr.

Dorsett" and-said that at the same time

Dorsett was on the fBl payroll, he was

speaking in "a most inflammatory man-

ner" at Ku Klux Kian rallies in North

• Carolina.

Morgan press aide Neil Hill said the

reference was to George Dorsett of

Greerisboro, a long time participant in

/ KKK affairs and the chaplain of the

state Klan.

Dorsett was identified by the Greens-

bord Daily News in

ecember as the

FBI's principal 'contact in the state

KKK, but until now his identity has not

been officially confirmed by Morgan, the

iFBI or the Senate Intelligence Commit-

Jee, of which Morgan is a member.

In a speech prepared for delivery be

fore an audience at Wake Forest Univer-

sity's Law Day

observance,

Morgan

detailed several instances of what he

called the federal government's "law-

"morally reprehensible" and "shows a

lack of respect for law."

He cited the break-ins of homes of:

Socialists Workers Party members. by

the FBI without warrants, and of the re-

ported "organizing of Klaverns of the

Ku Klux Klan" in North Carolina in ar

attempt to weaken the influence of exist..

:ing Klan groups.

But, said Morgan, many were not

aware that the Res, dir. Dorsett, wis

was on the FBI payroll at tne time,

spoke in a most inflammatory. manner at

one of the largest Klan rallies in the

state."

The Senator quoted Dorsett as saying.

at a Raleigh Klan meeting in 1966

"We

don't intend to have any violence if we

* have to kill every nigger in America.

Commerted Morgan, "For an FBI in-

formant to act in this way is most im-

moral. It sets race against race and is a :

prelude to lawlessness."

He also cited the FBI's writing of an-

• onymous letters to individuals "in an ef-

fort to break up their marriages."

In one such case, he said, '

the FBI

wrote the wife of a Klansman that her

husband "had taken the flesh of another

unto himself," and in another letter to

the husband of a peace activist, wrote

that "your vid lady duesn't get enough

at home or she wouldn't be shucking

(see Spying: D-2, (ol. 1)

Page

Spying Confirmed

From D-1

fand jiving with our black men:"

.. Both letters, Morgan said, were "fa-

brications." and the FBI reported the

"only "Langible result" was that the hus.

band and wife in one care separated.

Said Morgan, "Apparently our FBI

has forgotten the maxim, 'What God has.

joined together, let no man put assur

i del.

Morgan was critical of the FBI's ac-

Stions in these cases; saying, "All of this

gimmoral and illegal activity was carried

fout.with the excuse that it was in the in-

terest of national security. National se-

Acurity became the catch-all for illegal

Hactivity."

But the Constitution, said Morgan,

"gives no one, not even the president,

i the right to break the law.... We must

* make it clear that everyone, from the

• president to the nost common clizen,

must obey the jaw, that no one is ex-

¿empt for any yeason. Only then can we

• be certain of preserving our freedom."

On 4/27/76, former U. S. Ambassador Theodore Gus

„now a vice-chairman of the Atlantic Council of

and 12esed st q S (Acus), contacted Supervisor J. P. Thomas

regarding a Bureau investigation of a former ACUS employee.

During the conversation, the Ambassador said that, although

he did not seek any comment from the Bureau, he felt obliged

to express his views

to Supervisor Thomas regarding leaks

by members of Congressional staffs.

He said that he felt

that the leaks of security information by Congressional

staffs, and particularly the disclosures made by the Church MB

Committee (Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities)

regarding national security matters and the attacks made

by the Church Committee on the CIA and the FBI, were

"the most insidious" forms of "sabotage" of our intelligence

efforts.

REC-LL

The Ambassador was informed that we

the concern of individuals such as him for national Securtty. D

He assured Supervisor Thomas that he and his coLleague$PR 29 1976

protect this country.

met with Charles I. Lombard, Senator Goldwater's designee on

captioned Committee, at which time Lombard inquired as to the

possibility of the Director meeting with Senator Goldwater to

discuss Soviet activities against Capitol Hill.

Senator

Goldwater's concern in this area has been heightened by recent

public allegations concerning the activities of an aide to

Senator James O. Eastland on behalf of the soviets and other

and the Ku Klux Klan.

Rooney, as well as other members of the

2) That the 14 "bugs" that were installed in the hotel

and motel rooms of Dr. Martin

were not installed to ascertain his degree of affiliation with the

Communist Party.

Richard Larry

That the wiretap which the late Congressman Hale Boggs

claimed to be installed on his telephone by the FBI was actually

placed on his telephone by his wife (now Congresswoman Lindy Boggs)

this matter came to the attention of the FBI.

The Church Committee report is scheduled to be released

sometime toward the end of April. It is obvious that someone who

has knowledge of the contents of that report is disclosing infor-

mation to the "New York Times."

Inasmuch as the report has not

been made public it would be most inappropriate for the Bureau to

comment on the information obtained by the "New York Times" or

authenticate the veracity of the information set forth above.
