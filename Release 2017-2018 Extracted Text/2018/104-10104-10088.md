MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

‘SUBJECT: Orlando Avila y Bosch

03

te rl ep Haiti Desk called on
25 May 1967 and « had been advised by an asset
im Now York that Rene Jusres Leon had been arrested by tho
FBI in New York City on that date. A
arrest of Leon had been issued by the District Court for the
Southern District of Fleride since he failed to appear for his
arraignment in March 1967. He was indicted along with °3
Rolando Masferrer for plotting an invasion of Haiti. Mr.
oaid that they had ne operational interest in Leon, but their sources
had indicated Leon might be,considered a political ascet in the post
Duvallier era ia Haiti. Mr. asked my opinion as to
whether or net this possible use of Leon might have an
effect on ges being dropped against him. I teld
Mr. that it seemed highly unlikely that the Judge or
the United States Attorney would consider dropping the charges
since Leon had failed to appear before the court when ao ordered.

2. called Mr. Morris, Internal Security Divisien,
Department of Justice, the attorney handling both the Macferrer
and Bosch prosecutions, and teld him that Leen had been arrested.
it was in a previous conversation with Mr. Morris that he told
me that the United States Attorney expected to obtain the indictment
against Besch on 31 May 1967. Myr. Morrie said that both the
United States Attorney and the Department of Justice were
censidering postpening the date of bringing the indictment against
Bosch because of the problems which had develeped in Miami after
@ Cuban refugee named Rivero had been arrested, The information
available indicates that Orlando Besch has been the leader of the
protest demonstrations against Rivero’s arrest. I would therefore
seem prudent to delay the indictment rather than precipitate
greater demonstrations in the Cuban community of Miami.

CONFIDENTIAL


jury will convict Bosch of the current Arms Centsol

charges, A separaie problem which may tafluence postpenement

of the indictment is the continuing publicity generated by the New
Orleans District Attorney with hie tavestigation of the assassination
. Of President Kennedy and his continuing references te the involvement
ef Cubans both.in New Orleans and Miami in the conspiracy. j
