Win m a clay after

El Loco's determ

(lottor undated)

(29 June 1955 - translation)

Suave: (a nickname for UNS:AFU/s)

Today I spoke to a friend in the inistry of Forsign Relations. He explained

• your situation well enough (or, it any be, correctly enough): ho told me that

to anyone

they had sent your Cuban passports back, goething that has never been dore/before.

(He also said) that you both can cone back when ever you want to, to your country.

This made me very happy because your situation has been completely claritied.

I should be happy to hear fron jou as soon as you receive this letter.

"'El loco" Alberto arrived tho days ago, to evezyone's surprise, but goodness,

that's the way he is.

It seems that he was nostalgic for his country.

This letter was delayed a long time in recent so beau ve atal nolared

(his return) a long time here - because the CHEKA/scares him.

Best, Rolando
