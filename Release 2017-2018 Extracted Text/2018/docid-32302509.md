Naturally, in view of the above-stated proposals, the Volunteers

for: Good Government, are receiving opposition Irom the

racketeering element in New Kensington, dominated by the

MANNARINOS and according to rumor, the incumbents are

receiving considerable sums from the racketeers as campaign

funds.

BOMBIK will be alert for any info of pertinence to the

FBI and will cooperate in any manner possible, especially.

If his group

is successful in its efforts

to unseat the

current New Kensington political machine.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
