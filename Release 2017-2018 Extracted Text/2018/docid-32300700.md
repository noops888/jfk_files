ZERVIS, a numbers writer himself, stated that he knows from

personal knowledge that everyone who.is. writing numbers in

the New Kensington area are turning into the MANNARINO

brothers. and have been instructed that if they are raided

and arrested they should consider themselves on their own

and that the MANNARINO brothers would not provide bond or 1
attorneys for them. ‘

In 1953, TOM TANNAS, City Clerk, Arnold, Pa., the adjoining
community to New Kensington, Pa., advised that the top
echelon-of the MANNARINO organization was composed of SAM
MANNARINO;. GABRIEL MANNARINO, wa., KELLY; WILLIAM.SAMS;-and

oe did not offer him any money, and that “in. order to provide
V/ ramselt with legal representation and bond money, he borrowed
$1,000 from MIKE-HAJADAKOS.

ZERVIS stated that in conversation with KELLY MANNARINO

about one month or two months ago, KELLY told him that he - i
considers MIKE HAJADAKOS as a trusted assistant because MIKE

keeps the books. for. the dice games, acts as cashier in the

dice games, and always maintains completely accurate records.

ZERVIS pointed out 6 in conversation with HAJADAKOS he
learned that J fFONTANA receives $125 a week from the
Qe MANNARINO operatioi us ‘Six percent commission of the ‘take

a the dice tables which according. to ZERVIS can run as \high

as $1,000 a week. \

-12-

HW 45854 DocId:32300700 Page 6


NW 45854

PG 92-228

learned that people. who. come. to the dice tables in New Kensington
lose .on occasion as. much as $20,000 and $30,000 in one night.

ZERVIS: said that. HAJADAKOS. recently. mentioned a young man
from Youngstown, Olio,. that was. described as a wealthy and
avid barbout player, who'on many occasions has lost as much
as $15,000 and $20,000, while on other occasions has won the
same amount.

ZERVIS. remarked that HAJADAKOS has become a wealthy man as
a-result of his association with the: MANNARINO ‘brothers and

has made several trips to-his hometown “in Peraia, Greece, located
near the Port of Athens. ZERVIS. explained that.HAJADAKOS

has been using his money to put up apartment and office buildings
in his home town and’ that: one particular piece of ‘property in
Peraia brings HAJADAKOS ‘a rental of $1,150 in a month, ZERVIS
said he believed this piece of property was an office building.

ZERVIS pointed out that the poolroom,located next door to ‘the
Laetus Club.in New Kensington. with. entrance. on Barnes. Street,
is the. location.where. the: big dice games.take place, ZERVIS
stated that the location is rented under the name.of ‘AL ROSS,
also known -as.AL ZEID or SEID, who GABRIEL MANNARINO. describes
as a:"cool:man" whenever he. is. given.an.assignment..

ZERVIS explained that it is rumored that GABRIEL MANNARINO
is very friendly with AL ROSS because ROSS supposedly served
time for a crime that GABRIEL MANNARINO committed. |

ZERVIS stated he would attempt. to determine further ‘information
about the rumor, : but doubted that he would. be able to, adding
that he personally believes the rumor has no basis and fact..

ZERVIS ‘continued that GABRIEL MAMNARINO has.a-young Syrian Cx
boy working for him naméd SP. IA, (phonetic) who runs one eal
of the barbout tables for EL MANNARINO and that approx-
imately six weeks ago SPIRO won $30,000 in‘a barbout game and
a few.weeks later lost his entire winnings. ZERVIS described
SPIRO HANNA as a rough boy used by the MANNARINO brothers to
collect: gambling debts.

ZERVIS pointed out that although many people may not be aware

PG 92-228

-of it that. re is actually some ill feelings between SAMUEL
and GABRIEF(MANNARINO as a result of a venture into the juke
‘pox business several years ago in which they lost a hugh amount

of cash. According to ZERVIS, the business was located in
Chicago, Illinois, and connected in some way with the Wurletizer -
‘Company, and that Attorney CHARLES MARGIOTTI, now deceased,

was involved in the-deal and also lost a considerable amount

of money.

ZERVIS explained that during the time the MANNARINO brothers
were attempting to set up this business in Chicago, SAM
MANNARINO actually took charge of the enterprise and ‘spent

a great deal of time in Chicago. ZERVIS said. that when things
began to go wrong, SAM would write to GABRIEL for additional
money and that GABRIEL was forced ‘to borrow money, but instead
of sending SAM the full sum he borrowed, he would send.only
half of it and retain the other half. :

ZERVIS said that after the business venture in Chicago
failed, GABRIELTMANNARINO seemed to control the purse strings.
and has continued to do so since that time.

ZERVIS said that GABRIEL MANNARINO has told him personally
that he was forced to push his brother, SAMUEL, in the back-
ground because he could not resist the temptation of spending
four and five: thousand dollars in.one- night like he did in ‘the
days they had the slot machines going ‘in Westmoreland County.

AZ

ERVIS remarked that he recently had a -conferSation with DAN

pen Chief of Police, New Kensington / about the ralage

<a by the Internal Revenue Service in New Kensington

on.January 6, 1958. ZERVIS stated that ZELOYLE told him that
he is. sick and tired of being embarrassed-because of GABRIEL
MANNARION and added that on the day of the raids an Agent of
the Internal Revenue Service came -to the Police Station to
notify him that a raiding party was in town and at that time
were raiding various clubs in the city. ZERVIS stated ‘that
ZELOYLE indicated that this action on ‘the part of the Internal.
Revenue Service embarrassed him because he had the very definite
feeling that the Internal Revenue Service did not trust him
with any advance warnings of the raids.

ZERVIS stated that he-does not believe ZELOYLE will break with
the MANNARINO brothers over this issue, but he desired to
point out there appears to be some ill feeling in iedniemi to
grow between them.

ZERVIS stated that in his judgment Saeco GABRIEL
MANNARINO's most trusted lieutenant an erson who will
some day inherit GABRIEL MANNARINO's gambling interests in
New Kensington. ZERVIS remarked that FONTANA spends almost
every day at the dice tables in New Kensington looking out
for the MANNARINOS'! oe from. approximately 1:00 PM
until closing time.

meeting of hoodlums at Apalachin, New York, stated that during
March, 1950, the MANNARINO brothers showed up in Los Angeles,
California, where they attempted to set.up operations, but
were forced to return to New Kensington, Pa., because their
" presence in the city created so much action on the part of
the local police.-

Greensburg, Pa., on February 6, 1958, advised SA WILLIAM J.
MYERS that he recalled making an investigation with-Captain
