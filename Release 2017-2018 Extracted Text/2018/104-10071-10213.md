II. Politics:

Ao In sugust of 1951 it was reported thet, the Cormuniat would

attempt to penetrate the Partido Accion Renovadora (PAR) to

such an oxtint that they would have cuntrol, whereby they could

elect Conmuniate to the National Assemuly®

The Communists did

Infiltrate PAR, but they became so numorous and so vociferous

that the members of PAR finally realised what had happened and

printed leafluts dennouncing the Communists within the Party.

PAR practically dissolved thereafter and again the Communists

voro left without a political front group.

The Coumnists dir

ing this time did a lot of talking and planning, but thoy admit

ted that it was difficult "under the OSORIO regime" to make pol-

lucas strides, but that they were maling great advatices in the

labor movement. It can be written that the Communist Party to-

day has had no

success in either establianing itself as a strong

political force nor has 1t buun able to use another polladeal par

ty as its tool.

most intelloctual Corumunist. le recently returned from Chile

where he was Counselor in the Salvadoran Embassy• He was accused

of smuggling in tax free cigarettes and atealing government doc-

unonts.

Upon his return to Salvador he vindicated himself with

both the foreign anistor and the Prosident. On 31 January, 1953

FAUSTO FERNANDEZ spoke at the National University at which time

he dinnounced Mardam and declared that he had returned to the

Catholie faith. The consensus of opinion among Commniets, stu-

dents, the Any, and the Prieste is that he, FAUSTO FERNAlDEZ,

has not renounced Comnunism, but is using another tactic (and the

only one that would per.it him to remain in the good graces of the

Government) to further the Conmunist cause. On or about 16 Feb

* ruary, 1953 thure appeared on the streets a clandestine Communist

leaflet, which is belleved by several sources to have been written

by FAUSTO FER'ANDER. It can be said that at the present FAUSTO

FERNANDIZ is boing disoreet and only the future will prove or dis

prove his own statements.

propaganda campaign; consequently, 1t 10 lenwon that Labor, In

IV. Propaganda

A.

communist propaganda 18 neglible.

Since the State of Siege was

declared the 27th of September,

1952 there have been enly tho

Instances in which communiat propaganda has appeared on theatreets

al San Salvador.

In both cases the propaganda was mimeographed

and did not appear to have a large circulation as persona

_re-

celving much propaganda were diffioult to find (not even (JUGULAR

could find a copy among hia Cominiat friends) and there were 02

no editorial conments on the appearance of the propaganda. The

Law in Dafense of the Constitution passed by the lational Assembly

in Decembar, 1952 males 1t 1llogal to bo a Communiet, to parti-

cipate in ary Camunist activity, or to wort on ball of Commun

ian in any minar.

thie law and the fairly rigid'application of

it by the loverment has undoubtedly deterred may fron presoting

in ary fashion Commnist propaganda. (The Govertment has in the

past falled to recognined the right of Habeue Corpun In those cases

al Jailed Communista).

Bo

Recently there have been two newspaper artioles which may have been

Commandst Inspired but this is pure speculation and nothing more. The

uparto da Occidente of Santa Ana which i8 edited by one Airude →

PARADA (once exiled for oppoition to President OSORIO) published

an artiole that the United States Marina had landed In Quatemala

to protect the United Frult Compary. No source of by-line mas given.

Another artiole published by several of the nonspapere but which

seemad to have originated in Honduras, Costs Rica, or Managua stat-

ed that the HENRY FORD III Foundation had given five illion dal-

Jare to fight Communism In Central America.

and in all modia of propaganda. Editoriale, cartoons, anci

newspaper articlos deploting Communion in its worse light

appear every day in the five dally newspapers. The radio

does 1ts share of anti-Communiat propaganda. There has been

emphasis on Cormnian.

V.

Summary

In cumation, the PCS 10 inoffective as a political force at

the present time. It has not been a political force in the

last twenty years, but it has/made progress in labor matters

and probably at one time controlled more than one half of the

syndicatos.

This 18 no longet true, however, and the PCS has

loat most of 1ta influence among labor by a strong govertment

polloy againat Communim. In acidttion, anti-Commnist propa-

ganda, by both the lovernment and private intereate, has been

offeotive in waning labor away from Comunlat influence.

Bo

The new polloy of the PCS 1a to to be lesa overt and moro

clandestine.

The PCS alma to "planta 1ta mambers in atrategic

unions and governuent officon, to "cooperate", and to await

the opportane tina bafore they announce thenselves as Commnists.

It appears that the PCS 1a almoat completoly dependent upon the

Communist Party of Quatonala for 1ta Inatructions and directives,

consequently the succesa or failure of the Conmuniate in Quate-

mala will dotermine the futaro polloins of the PCS. (This 1a

also the bollel and tho fear of the Salvadoran Goverment).

The PCs till produce anti-uS propaganda at every opportunity,

but at the presont thoy have no organ of propaganda and the two

leaflete they have produced since September, 1952 are coneider

od ineffective. The peoplo of El salvador appear to completely

support President OSORIO whom they recognise as dedicated to 1n-

creasing wagos, raising the standard of living, granting better

ecucation, and obtaining bettor food and living quarters for all
