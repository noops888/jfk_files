Appratsal of Content: 3e

Tho militla is no longer regarded by the Cuban Goverment as a sorious

faotor in internal or external defense.

Instead, it 18 used as a recruiting

ground for the Armed Foroes, which are now thoroughly professional and

well-trained.

2. Armed clashes between opposition groups and goverment forces have occurred

In several provinoes, Inaluding Matanzas,. Canaguey, and PInar del AlO.

3. There has been a notable increase in sabotage since February or March 1962.

Buildings and fastories have been blown up or burned, cane fiolds set on

fire, and above all, passive reistance has grown in certain industries,

espoolally the sugar refining industry. A different pattern of sabotage

has emerged. Instead of setting off explosive or incendiary bombs ihare

they night cause loss of life or injury, thus arousing popular resentment

against the opposition, targets are chosen for the maximum financtal damage

or dislocation.
