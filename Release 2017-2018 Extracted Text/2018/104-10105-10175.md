MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Gordon NOVEL

On 23 May Mr. Papich left with us a copy of attached

FBI teletype.

FBI will confirm this information by formal

menorandum.

Mr. Papich requested information on two points with

permission to make our reply available to the Attorney General:

a) nature and extent of CIA intorest in the

Double-chek Corporation®

our comments and

observations on the draft

letter purportedly prepared by Gordon NOVEL.

03 3. After consultation with Mr. Jacob Esterline, DC/WH,

SOD, and Mr. Lawrence Houston, OGC, the following

reply was given Mr. Papich:

"Double-chek is a "shell" corporation used

in the past by CIA to recruit pilots.

It was

also used as a front for the payment of the

"Birminghan widows". No individual bearing

the name of Gordon NOVEL had any connection with

Double-chek nor with CIA.

Mr. Lawrence Houston is in constant touch

with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General,

Nathaniel Cossack, on this matter, and will

tell him about present developments.

Mr. Houston comments that anyone could

have propared the letter but it really does

sound like NOVEL's cock-eyed approach rather

There is a fair chance that

NOVEL might have written it. This will probably

make another headline for Garrison but we

don't feel it could do the Agency much damage".

On the question of the alleged gunshot fired at NOVEL,

Mr.

Papich advised that the FBI is not investigating the matter.

It has not been confirmed as yet that anyone did shoot at NoVEL.
