MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : Gordon NOVEL

1, On 23 May Mr. Papich left with us a copy of attached
FBI teletype. FBI will confirm this information by formal
memorandum. :

2. Mr. Papich requested information on two points with
permission to make our reply available to the Attorney General:

a) nature and extent of CIA interest in the
Double-chek Corporation,

b) our comments and observations on the draft
letter purportedly prepared by Gordon NOVEL.

nsultation with Mr. Jacob Esterline, DC/WH,
SOD, and Mr. Lawrence Houston, OGC, the following
Yeply was given Mr. Papich:
“Double-chek is a "shell" corporation used
in the past by CIA to recruit pilots, It was
also used as a front for the payment of the
“Birmingham widows", No individual bearing

the name of Gordon NOVEL had any connection with
Double-chek nor with CIA.

Mr. Lawrence Houston is in constant touch
with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General,
Nathaniel Cossack, on this matter, and will
tell him about present developments.

Mr. Houston comments that anyone could
have prepared the letter but it really does
sound like NOVEL's cock-eyed approach rather
than Garrison. There is a fair chance thet

NOVEL might have written it, This will probably
make another headline for Garrison but we
don't feel it could do the Agency much damage".

4, On the question of the alleged gunshot fired at NOVEL,

Mr, Papich advised that the FBI is not investigating the matter.
It has not been confirmed as yet that anyone did shoot at NOVEL.
