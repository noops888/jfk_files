MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

VIA: Director, Center for the Study of
Intelligence
FROM: John F. Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT: Appointment of Directorate Focal Points
for JFK Assassination Board Requests (AIUO)

_1. Action Requested: It is recommended that you request
the Directorates to appoint focal point officers for purposes of

responding to requests from the (President Kennedy) Assassination
Records Review Board. (AIUO)

2. Background: President Clinton appointed the Board to
oversee the release of records related to both the assassination
of President Kennedy and the investigations into the assassination.
The Board has forwarded to us the first (attached) of what are
likely to be many requests for additional information from CIA
records. The Board will not complete its work until late 1997
at the earliest. (AIUO)

The Historical Review Group (HRG) has reviewed more than
400,000 pages of JFK-related records, most of which were contained
in the “sequestered records” that were collected for the House
Assassination Committee's investigation and in the Oswald 201 file.
Up to now, no new searches have been required. Now that the Board
has begun to generate requests for additional information, the
Agency needs to create a mechanism for processing the requests and
for tasking components to conduct records searches. (AIUO)

3. Recommendation: That you request each Directorate to
appoint a focal point to work with HRG as the principal liaison
with the Board, and that you name someone to perform the same
function for the DCI Area. Attached is a proposed memorandum
for your signature. (AIUO)

Administrative Officer, DCI

FROM: Executive Director

SUBJECT: Appointment of Directorate Focal Points
for JFK Assassination Board Requests

1. I would like each of you to appoint a focal point
officer for your Directorate who would be responsible for
responding to requests for information from the (President
Kennedy) Assassination Records Review Board. (AIUO)

2. The Agency has received the first (attached) of what
are likely to be many requests from the Board for information
related to the assassination of President Kennedy and to the
investigations into the assassination. Up to now, the Board
has focused on the "sequestered" records CIA had collected
for the House Assassination Committee's investigation and
documents that had been part of the Oswald 201 file. It is
expected that the new requests will require records searches
to be done for additional information. (AIUO)

3. The Historical Review Group (HRG) of the Center for
the Study of Intelligence (CSI), which has been the Agency's
principal liaison with the JFK Board, will continue in that
role. HRG will receive requests from the Board, and then
forward them to the Directorate focal points for action.
Responses from the Directorates will be coordinated by HRG
which will make the responses available to the Board. (AIUO)

4. Please provide the name of your focal point officer to
John Pereira, Chief, HRG (x80373>secure) by 13 April. (AIUO)
