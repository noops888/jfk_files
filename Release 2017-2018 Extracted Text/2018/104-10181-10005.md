1.0816 January:-1969 QUTINID reported a discussion
between Subject ‘and-the Chief of the,‘Rumanian Trade. delegation
in Spain, during which. the Rumanian asked when they could meet:
Subject invited the Rumanian-to Wis ‘home where, he said, he
has'set up-a-small office and: was beginning to work more at
home thah inthe office, because of the addéd comfort.’ (We
.!wouldn't be surprised if this was suggested by his wife-who ~
~< 4s very ‘jealous of hér husband.) ‘The meeting was arranged

for 1130 hours on 17 January. -ANAUTO-1 commented that he is

up quite.early in the morning, presumably ‘to begin work in

his. office. : ;

2, The-above report is the first we have received on.
Subject's use of his honie as an office. The invitation to'”
the Rumanian, of course, casts suspicion on the nature of the

conversation,

3, Since his move to new quarters, AMAUTO-1's home is
about. 50: yards from two WOFIRM staffers - Martin B. CRYMM and
Conrad B. FALAGIARO. (See attached sketch). Edwin B, RATTEREE
lives: approximately 200 yards ‘from the AMAUTO hume. This
proximity to AMAUTO-1's home by three staffers brings up the
question of the use of an RF device to monitor conversations
in AMAUTO's office at home, assuming at this time, that he
has a phone in the office, most likely an extension of the
home phone. ‘For planning purposes, we would appreciate from.
MKNOVA a.list of requirements for a target study in the use.”
of an RF device. If other means are available for external
penetration of his home we would welcome your suggestions
and comments. Please advise us also if the RF device is still
a controlled item, which cannot be discussed with or released
toliaison, Your earliest reply would be appreciated,

In the four ‘month period. since the forwarding of ref B, .
the’ QUDOZE “and ‘QUT MID Opérations ‘have continued. te provide insights
into the program of the PBRUMEN official establishment in Spain, the
requiremen' laid-on it and the-evolution in the thinking of
AMAUTO=1 and his staff as they work toward expanding their contacts
and influence in the. political, ecdzosic and cultural-propsganda
ficlds; ‘These developments ¥ provide the subject matter for
subsequent dispatches, However, in addition to such conventional -
"public relations"; the QUDOZ® Reports have recently carried evi=
dence ‘of MRCUILE activity, . Decaus uch activity automatically
means SUMEN involvement in Spain's internal affairs, QUOTA has
taken an even greater than usual. interest in these developments.
Translations of the transcripts detailing this inforgation are given

below,

2, The earliest and certainly the most striking MHGUILE in-
formation was forvarded under ref A describing AMAUTO-1's advice
to-AMADIEU-1' on the techniques of living a, clandestine life, on
the use of disguise and'on the necessity for good organization for
“with. bad" organization we are"lest". Then, 8 QUDOZE Report of
30 April 68 summarized a discussion on the 1sck of personrel in

th@:Enbassy to make scientific and technical contacts, at which

tise AMAUTO-1 digressed into describing the cover for a ney member
of the staff whom he apparently expected to arrive in the near,
future. "..,.,what is lacking 1s a comrade who could take care

of the cultural and apparently the technical aspect also. Who
could also ascertain who are the Americans, their addresses, in .
vhat streets are located their,..." He adds that this comrade will
have to move about, to make contacts, to be up on everything, and
4f time remains to do other things. He added that he resesbers the
President (of PBRUNEN) gave much importance. to this as a matter of
honor for all the wissions abroad. He repeated that the technical
aspect (i.e.collecting technics) information) required a comrade, o

collect informition for thes as AMAUTO-1 1s heard to coment’ that
they have to “invent” the vork of this comrade in order that he

via PBRUWEN national flight, after home ieave in PBRUMEN, the Qupoz§

AMAUTO=1 on future plans. Tro were of MHGUILE interes

“As | -QUDOZE Rport of 13. Warch 68. AMAUTO-1 says, "this is...
with the American movément.in Spain-and with the monopoly
that they lave here", He ssya,: "In ay judgement our -
“fundamental problem ip Spain from the political potat of
view is to ascertain t there is behind all this, what
there here, wé must get ourselves in notion”, “That is a
very ‘important point for us, to ascertain what are their
names, who are those who are. here, how they (the Americans:
are moving", ‘He adds tat, "If-we are able to find out,
will be able to stop then completely.”

B.. QUDOZE Report uf 14 Mar 68. AMAUTO-1 says that they have

.- to find out "what are the forces in Spain, vith the pos-

°- -gibility of our having access (to thea)", fe comments that
Spain, is'at"a crossroads internaily and externally. - He
says they have to find out what ie happeniag in Spain,
whether thoy give the workers liberty to strike, etc.
He again repeats all they have to fiud out, mentions find-
ing out "who are the sonarchists, what forces they repre-
sent, to what forces are they inited, who are the elezents
that are being finaaced| by the American
Embassy", "Which are those acattered elements that the
pewapaper of the Movement has accused of being backed by

i

the Awerican Embassy, what financial pover do they have?" i

4. AMAUTO-1 had apparently set great hope on the 1 May 68
anti-government demonstration by workers and students which, as
Headquarters is aware, the police effectively handled, Ina 2 i
May QUDOZE Report, AMAUTO-1 repeatedly commented on what a tremen- |
dous failure the demonstration had been; be kept asking AMADRIFT-1 |
what had happened, why the Spanish people had not responded, why
the workers had not, and finally said "The next demonstretion we
are going to name here a member of the Enbassy",

“| -not-send, messages but this seemed acceptable.

. : On Wonday, ‘4, December 1967, the day oftér his arrival,
RUIZ ordered the Cubaa consuls in Barcelona, Sevilla and
Vigo to Madrid for-.a-meéting, The order: was couched in terns
of “wanting ‘to meet". thom, but-after their arrival on
Wednesday, éeibér, &11 partics settled down to a detailed
meetiag in ch prinary:attentiom was given to adainistrative
matters, t¥ade and propaganda, Thé latte: two subjects will
be dealt with in separate dispatches. On the administrative
side, RUIZ listéned sympathetically to complaints about low
salaries, old buildings ahd inadequate operating budgets and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and a-report on the.consuls’ current needs, their
monthly. balances-and their administrative activities. The
printing and telephone bills wero the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions,

4, By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission
in. general for forwarding to Havana and which he first
discussed with his subordinates, He started by assuring
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was
complete. Apparently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel
changes and who had previously beén
mosteager to return PCS to Havana, now has gone to Havana
on vacation. He left Madrid on the 20 December 1967 Iberia

flight.

5, The Cuban mission has certain financial problems
since the present budget dates from previous yer’s and does
not cover current expenses, However, the “new economic
activities of the consulate" are expected to assist with the
problem, Here RUIZ is presumably referring to the pressure
brought to bear in November. 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigration. Office to force Cuban exiles to register
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22.50 fee for a valid
passport. Enough exiles have responced to this pressure to
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission.
Thia source of income will Jast!as long as the Cubans’ friends
in the Foreign Ministry are able to assist then.

6. The reception of Cuban official travelers at the
_airport and the handling of Embassy pouches poses a
continuing adrinistrative problem for the Embassy.
who is in charge of this airport work has to
devote himself exclusivaly to taking care of the courters
and their pouches when any come in, leaving visitors to fend
for themselves, This situation has been alleviated by
other Embassy staff members jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes. Now, RUIZ has declared
‘that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy because
they have a work plan to fulfill, Thus, he has leit himself
with an uiresolved problem he’ sust face in the very near

future... —— seareseseses

on the t. that-Cuba is practically Unknown .in Spain,
that Cuban products are: never scen in the local stores
and that the view \of Cuba of the average Spaniard has
‘cone fron ‘the éxiles. He has continued-to discuss the
need for advertising Cuban products and considered
» decorating his office and his home with Cuban items and
furniture so he could show a little bit of Cuba to his
Spanish..and foreign contacts. Another consequence of -
this desire to put Cuba's best foot forward is a certain
harshness in dealing with the shortcomings of his -
colleaxucs and fellow Cubans outside the mission, calling
attention to ai¥-deficiencies in their conduct and ways
of. dealing with the persons they moet: As recently as
in ‘a QUDOZE ‘r¢port ‘of 13 July he was complaining that the
Cubans seem, to! have lost ‘the elegant touch in their

public functions,

3...RUIZ's attitude toward money follows logically
fron his desire. that Cuba's prestige increase and he is
quite willing’ to spend money where it will show. The
Embassy's 6 January reception was an expensive affair,
the Embassy -and ‘Commercial officers take their Spanish
contacts to the best restaurants, he and his wife pay
30,000 pesetas (approximately $430.00) rent per month
for a house deemed suitable to his position and buy new
clothes without ‘hesitation for tae various diplomatic
functions. “ Before he went on home leave on 6 August 1968,
he was encouraging his staf? to rent better apartments

enough for sfiall receptions of as many as 40 People,
All uf this is qiilte in accord with RUIZ's own hourgdisa@

} tastes, reflected more than any thing-@Tse—in his Eren
‘Titetest in clothes and in being well dressed. Yet the
Cuban mission operates on a slim budget and the salaries
are pot high, Station Madrid has no information on
whether Cuban mission personnel receive a housing
allowance but assumes they must as otherwise RUIZ, at
least, could never make ends meet, RUIZ earns a gross
salary of $681.50 per month and all his living expenses
including clothes, food, medical expenses, education for
the couple's 5 children and perhaps utilitics must come
from this sum, RUIZ also expects to be able’to invite
Cuban officitls transiting Madrid and his Spanish and
foreign contacts home for Lunch or dinner at any time,
There is no indication that he receives a representation

RUIZ is plainly ‘cautious th his dealings with Havana over

in Madrid. Whe difference in the couple's manner of
Jiving between Havana and Madrid must be striking since
RUIZ hada good position in the Ministry of Foréign Commerce

a compulsive talker and apparently uses his long,
conversations-and his consultations over some course
of action as a means of psychological reinforcement.
He has given the impression of being insecure in his
-hosition and when faced with an accumulation Of — "~~
problems in the office prior to home leave, was talking
of resigning and returning to Cuba. This insecurity
may. account: for his touchiness over the way he is |;
treated by the Spaniards, especially those in government
Positions.” “He has been noted describing several of his
interviews .with, Spanish Ministers or people holding
important government positions at great length, going”
into much detail on the length of the meeting, Af they
“shook hands, if the person smiled, if he had anything
nice to sdy-about Cuba or ‘the Cubans, etc. As the
addressees know, /RUIZ came to his post as a. transfer
from the Ministry of Foreign Commerce. On numerous
occasions he has’ said that his life interest is in
commerce and industry and prior. to his vacation in Cuba;
he was increasingly depressed over his present position
and his ability to fill it, which may account for some
of this sense of personal uncertainty. He has scemed
a hard worker and a man with good ideas on the work of
the ‘Embassy and how it should be organized, ideas which
he has repeated endlessly, but he has been unable to

inspire in his subordinates. In his disputes with

in June he complained about the lack’ of team spirit In

the office,

§. RUIZ's political ideas are centered in the Cuban

revolution and the Station considers him as an
4unquestioned regime supporter. . However, his approach

is different tron that of the younger, less. intelligent
men who-have known nothing else, RUIZ has hada

; Sufficient breadth of education and experience to make
[a choice, to have reached his own decision that the
Castro regime is good for Cuba and that Marxism as
interpreted by the Cubans is an adequate intellectual
foundation for life. A QUDOZE Report of 13 December 1967
included a discussion with a Spanish enployce of the
Embassy during which RUIZ explained that the Cuban
revolution is different from any other revolution there
has ever been in the world, that it has different
characteristics and trajectories, that in spite of having
a mark of Marxist principles it has many. variations

which make it different. ‘These variations are unknown
cven to some of the comrades themselves. In a QUDOZE
Report of 23 June, he commented on certain features of
the Cuban system as “very difficult to understand unless
one is of the left". The QUDOZE Report of 4 July quoted
extensively in OSMA-24,112 of 9 August 1968 showed

most clearly RUIZ's view of Cuba and the revolution as
one entity and to sce himse} hi ructure, a
part of it and serving it. Beyond t, his nd runs

in business and public relations -rather than political
channels and he_ has shown less interest in the policies

6. RUIZ seems to have little time for his wife,

Milda, and their children and, at least in public, hig ;
‘attitude toward his wife has been quite curt. He has 1 :

Re: claims is incapable of doing. Finally, this

pagticular argument ende forin of compromise with
agreeing to call the following day and remind

“« “fim that- he “should ca inister",

3. On-4 July, the battle was renewed over the
distribution of Che's Diary, At that time the Embassy
only had G or 7 copics. which were being loaned out on an
overnight basis, RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary
"to a- mountain of people" while Clas also offering
-it freely and without consulting about. the action or
his ‘list of recipients, RUIZ scolded him roundly for this
and,. ignoring attempts at self-justification, told
him he had to respect the instructions he received, At
one point in his tirade, RUIZ even went so far as to
suggest it would be better for one of them to leave and go
to work in another country, for example Rumania, Several
interesting items emerged from this’ long quarrel:

¥ lias“ Sone indefineat problemiwhichyStation’
Madrid assumes is related'to his personality and his

approach to his. fellow workers, Ruiz said, "Look,

hete-everyone. knows the problem you have, It
1

“know of the problem..." Ruiz thén' insisted ‘on th
importance of discussing problems’ among the comrades
and said "for example in your case, you have been
foolish in not outlining t + I was waiting
and was waiting and

B, RUIZ commented that now he can understand
the attitude of CALZADILLA, Before, he had thought
CALZADILLA was in crror but'now he feels the same way,
He mentions “an ambivalence” and says he will not i
react the same way, “that CALZADILLA. was: wrong -in - -.
limiting liimsel£ ‘duced. group ‘oft persons: whereas.
Tiwild: continues-to<g h.everyone, not: ~
just’ a few.” .

~Cy ~RUIZ- takes a -broader. view..of. Party membership : .
than his contémporaries.’ In commenting on the weekly ~ iediiane =
study circle for members of the Party, he set forth
his opinion that, all the comrades of the local Cuban
Mission should participate even though they may not
be members because in his eyes it is as if they all
really were members.

D. RUIZ repeated a statement he has made on
previdus occasions - the great interest of his life
is foreign commerce. However, in this 4 July QUDOZE
Report, he added the interesting detail that he had
not wanted to come to Madrid as Charge and, in affect,
had been persuaded to come against his will, He
believes he is vest able to serve in the control of

ustry and that is where he could perform a
as every revolutionary

to do the mast, "Until now, [ have always done

with my present limitation of criteria, [ should i
not ‘be here”. He repeated his canviction that-he :
is wasting his talents and doing ncthing for Cuba

he could do elsewhere, "! believe that with which

I am best able to serve my country-is in the

are being done badly because I have knowledge and
because. I arrive at. my conclusions through the
accounting,,,look, here I am wasting my presence

and my resources when I am able to be useful to
production in another position,”

By the-end ot this 4 July report, RUIZ had exhdusted all
his combativeness and appeared very. depressed,

‘4, RUIZ ‘is due for home leave in Ilavana the first
Part’ of August: There have been indications scattered

1. On 10 January 1968, AMAUTO-1, ‘in one of ‘his ‘many daily
discussions with his subordinates, reflected on the international
position of his country, and among the things he said, we quote
the following which may -be"of possible interest to addressees,

Although ‘part’ of the discussion was’ not heard because of the

emotional inflection of the’ speaker, we feel. that the jist of
the discussion clear and understandable, 7

“We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba...is
favorably disposed to’ do whatever... (AMAUTO=1 begins
to talk against the United States) that when the
Americans have to raise. the whité flag...because the
first. plane that appears on radar... (ANAUTO-1 is
speaking excitedly and itis very difficult to understand
each word but it appears that he is talking about the
positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and
Camaguey and:that with these missiles, we can cover
Miami, New York, and all their bases and all of their
"mierda", , ,if the Americans say they are going to
s@i them (misuiles? planes?), we will send them; if
they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the
first plane that comes to invade... (AMAUTO-1's sub-
ordinate remarked that 15 October 62 marked a point

in international politics, when the Yankees ordered
the. Soviets to withdraw their missiles), . .(AMAUTO=1
injected) "they (the Soviets) presented them (the
Cubans) with ten bombs",

2, Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is
that AMAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive is~

siles in Cuba,

given to administrative matters, trade and propaganda, The

2, The:Castro regime has always attached great
importance td. propaganda activities of all kinds and when the
new Cuban Charge d'Affaires began to re-organize the work of

: his subordinates, propaganda matters were not overlooked,
According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations, the
provincial consulates have been receiving four types of
propaganda for distribution, two of which were identified.
One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created
by the Castro regime, for example "The Voice of Vietnam",
The other is newspapers, PACHECO, Consul in Sevilla,
mentioned Granma, which he claimed many people read, and
added that Intely he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde,

3, RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and
the distribution of propaganda, He asked the consuls to
make a list of all the institutes and all the scientific
centers in their territories including the special positions
of these centers and any other relevant information, They
are to use these lists to develop a systematic work plan

+ \of visiting each one, making friends, trying to obtain
scholarships for Cuba, trying to obtain publications and

11 December 1967, had been “ordered
to prepare-a work plan for cultural ac ivity, In this
context cultural activity is not limited to~art;—music and
literature-but miso includes public information media, The
Cubiin’ Embassy ‘has already built up a series of press contacts
over the past years and the Cuban Revolution seems to draw
a ready response in Spanish intellectual circles as
evidenced by the Spanish deicgates attending the Cultural
Congréss held ‘in Havana from 4-11 January 1968, An expense-
paid trip is always attractive to be sure but the delegates,
many of whom were not communists, were also,sympathetic to

Spanish government, Station Madrid expects an increase in
the propaganda and political action activities, of the Cuban
official ‘establishment. pea

1, . The new Cuban Ambassador to Spain, Orestes
Guillermo RUIZ.Perez arrived in Madrid onthe Iberia flight
of 3 December 1967 accompanied by. his wife, Nilda, and three
sons, CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor liad not .been a strong °

_administrator and’had let the various components of the - ~
Cuban, official establishment in Spain run their own affairs,
This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a new chief to be
a “new broom" and rearrange things according. to his own
lights, led Station Wadrid to expect some ‘changes particularly
within the Embassy, However, the QUDOZE and QUTINID operations

“-have shown RUIZ at least initially to be an aggressive and
well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly
reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to
make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial
sweeping of a new broom, Underlying RUIZ's actions and
proposais is the clear implication that he came to Madrid
with the specific task of upgrading the Cuban mission in
Spain both in terms of prestige and effectiveness, Station
Madrid will transmit to the addressees the relevant
information on this program as it becomes available from the
QUDOZE and QUTINID operations along with information on the
official Cuban personalities administering the program,

2.. A striking difference between RUIZ and his
predecessor was noted in. the QUDOZE and QUTINID reports of
that first week, RUIZ has no inhibitions over spending
money, One of the Embassy cars, a Peugeot was replaced with:
a new model and there was discussion of replacing the other  ,
two Peugeots with new ones, Nilda, RUIZ's wife, was picked
up by the wife of Iwho turned $200 over to her to go

deputy, on the proper clothes for diplomatic Tunetions in :
Madrid and’ an appointment was to be made witha tailor,
Nilda.declared that the apartment where CALZADILLA’ and his
fariily had Lived-cconomically was Inadequate and they

decided to look for a chalet, something very spacious and <
well-priced, ‘They subsequently seriously constécred ene

known to rent for 30,000 pesctas ($500) per month and then
‘turned it down, apparently for reasons other than price, A

new telex machine was ordered for the Embassy. The technician
stated they could install-a-telctype that could only receive,

not send, messages but this seemed acceptable,

5 3... On Slonday, 4 December, 1967, the day.after his arrival,
RUIZ ordered the Cuban consuls in Barcelona, Sevilla and
Vigo to Madrid fora meeting, The ‘order. was couched in terms
of "wanting to meet" then; but after their arrival on
Wednesday, 6 Decembér, all parties scttled down to a detailed
meeting in which primary attention was given to administrative
matters, trade.and propaganda, The latter two subjects-will, eyaniitisticet
gous be dealt-with in separate dispatches, On the administrative
iarued side, RUIZ listened sympathetically to complaints about low
salaries, old buildings and inadequat> operating budgets. and
concluded by asking for a monthly report on receipts and
expenses and a report on the consuts' cur.ent needs, their
monthly balances and their administrative activities.. The
printing and telephone bills were the two items of expense
that kept recurring throughout the discussions,

4, By the end of the week, RUIZ had prepared a report
on the situation he found in the Chancerry and the mission
in general for forwarding to Havana and which he first tee

-- discussed with his subordinates, lie started by assuring 2
them that he had "found great co-operation among all the
comrades in this mission" and declared that the staff was i

complete. ently, RUIZ intends to make no personnel

5, The Cuban mission hos certain financial problems
since the present budget dates from previous years and does
not cover current expenses. lowéver, the "new, economic
activities of the consulate” are expected to assist with the
problem, Here RUIZ isi presumably referring to the pressure
brought to bear in November 1967 by Cuban sympathizers in
the Spanish Foreign Office working through the Customs and
the Immigrazion Office’ to force Cuban exiles to register
with the Cuban consulate and pay the $22,590 fee for a valid
passport, Enough exiles have responded to this pressure to
relieve some of the financial problems of the Cuban mission
This source of income will last as long as the Cvbans' friends
in the Foreign. Ministry are able to assist them,

6. The reception’ of Cuban official travelers at the
airport and the handling of Embassy pouches poses a
continuing administrative problem for the Embassy, Jose

_- DIAZ Puga, who is in charge of this airport work has to
“aévote himself exclusively to taking care of the cou
Snd their pouches when any cone in, leaving visitors to fend
for themselves, This situation has been alleviated by
ther. Embassy staff members jaunting out to the airport at
will to meet the incoming planes, Now, RUIZ has declared
that the rest of the Staff must stay in the Embassy because
they have a work planito fulfill, Thus, he has left himself
with an unresolved problem he must face in the very near

future.

7... The new. Ambassador ‘concluded his report with three
recommendations:

a. Ret another building where. the Chancillary,
the Commercial Office, the Constilate and the
7 _ Cubana Offices can all be housed instead of
0. being- dispersed in separate buildings as they’
i are now;

b. .Rent or preferably buy a residence for the Chief
of Mission, The one they now -have is. not
adequate; .

¢.. Send another person from Cuba who has the.
background’ to take’care of scientific work plus
: continuing. thé contacts the Mission will ‘have
peeecceestenese ~ 025) already:made, In view of RUIZ's previous
i statement on the ;compseteness of the staff, such
a person would likely. be a "non-official"
representative of one of Cuba's cultural fronts
such as the Casa de las Americas,

8, ‘RUIZ concluded his remarks by saying that in Spain
there is a tremendous field for the Cubans, they have no
language problem and they can doa great work, Such is the
goal ‘RUIZ has, proclaimed and that Station Madrid believes
he was ‘sent to attain. -

munications with RUIZ through Antonio VECIANA, an uncle of RUIZ"

were in correspondence with RUIZ, and that he was unvilling to act
as a "go-between," (UFGA-19006, dated 21 Decexber 1964.)
