On the administrative

since Cuba was

on thie: fact that Cuba is practically unknown in Spain,

that Cubal moduets are never soon in the local stoics

and that the viewlof Cuba of the average Spaniard has

lie has .continued to discuss the

need for advertising

Cuban products and considered

decorating his office and his home with Cuban items and

furnitüro

so he could show a little bit of Cuba to his

Spanish and forcign contacts.

Another conscquence of

this desire to put Cuba's

best foot forward is a certain

harshness in dealing with the shortcomings of his

colleagues

and fellow Cubans outside the mission, calling

Cubans seem to' have lost:the elegant touch in their

public functions.

3. RUIZ's attitude toward money follows logically

from his desire that Cuba's prestige increase and he is

quite willing to spend money where it will show.

Embassy's 6 January reception was an expensive

the Embassy-and Commercial officers take their

contacts to the best restaurants,

he and his wife pay

30,000 pesetas (approximately $ 130.00) rent per month

for a house deemed suitable to his position and buy new

clothes without hesitation for the various diplomatic

functions.

Before he went on home leave on 6 August 1968,

he was encouraging his stafi to rent better apartments

that would more nearly match their status as diplomats

and his wifo

was looking for a different house for them,

one with fewer maintenance headaches and with rooms large

-enough for amal receptions of as many

as 10 people.

/ All uf. this

is quite in accord with Ruiz's own bourgoise

tastes, reflected more than any thing else in his great

Interest in

Cuban mission opcrates on a slim budget and the salaries

Station Madrid has no information on

whether Cuban mission personnel reccive a housing

allowince but assumes they

must as otherwise RUIZ, at

least, could never make ends meot.

RUIZ earns a gross

salary of $681.50 per month and all his living expenses

including clothes, food, medical expenses, education for

the couple's 5 children and perhaps utilities must come

from this sum.

RUIZ also expects to be able to invite

Cuban officials transiting Madrid and his Spanish and

foreign contacts home for lunch or dinner at any time.

There

is no

indication that he receives a representation

allowance yet he will allow his wife to charge nothing

except

the saiaries of two maids to the Embassy and she

can't economize on food when they are alone because he

will no out to a restaurant rather than eat rice and beans.

RUIZ is plainly cautious in his dealings with Havana over

money. even while wanting to live as well as possible

in Madrid. The difference in the couple's manner of

Jiving between Havana

and Madrid must be striking since

RUIZ had i good position in the Ministry of Foreign Commerce

prior to becoming Charge d'Affaires and yet his wife told

Veri, the Embassy secretary and her closest friend,

she did not have a refrigerator in Cuba and would like

to take one back

These variations are unknown

even to some of the comrades themselves.

In a QUDOZE

Report of 23 June, he commented on certain features of

the Cuban system

as "very difficult to understand unless

one is of the left".

The QUDOZE Report of 4 July quoted

extensively in OSNA-24,112 of 9 August 1968 showed

most clearly RUIZ's view of Cuba and the revolution as

one entity and to see himself within that structure, a

part of it and serving it.

Bejond that, his mind runs

in business and public relations rather than political

channels and he has shown less interest in the policies

that he,

just as

bluntly disagreed. l

Dylew was that RUTZ lad come in

in a bad humor and rothing pleased hin

whercas RUIZ felt

should try putting himself 1i RUIZ's place, something

hc. claims

is incapable of doing.

Finally,

this

particular argument ended in a form of compromise with

Jagreeing to call

the following day and remind

him that he "should call the sinister".

3. ..

On 4 July the battle was renewed over

the

distribution of Che's Diary.

At that time the Embassy

only had 6 or 7 copies which were being loaned out on an

overnight basis.

RUIZ said he wanted to send the Diary

"to a mountain of people" while

was also offering

-It freely and without consulting RUlL about the action or

his list of recipients®

RUIZ scolded him roundly for this

and, ignoring L

him he had to respect the instructions he received.

att instruct sons fus recededo told

one point in his

tirade, RUIZ even went so far as to

suggest it would be better for one of them to leave and go

to work

in another country,

for example Rumania.

Several

interesting items emerged from this long quarrel:

has some undefined problem which Station

Madrid assumes is related to his personality and his

approach to his fellow workers.

Ruiz said,

There everyone knows

the problem you

"Look,

have.

It

Is necessary to be hard, because unfortunately all

the comrades that have come here through many soars

the problem...

Rutz then insisted on the

importance of discussing problems among the comrades

and

said "for example in your case, you have been

foolish in not outlining the problem.

I was waiting

and

was waiting and

RUIZ commented that now he can understand

the attitude of CALZADILLA:

Before, he had thought

CALZADILLA was in error but now he feels the same way.

He mentions "an ambivalence" and says he will not

react the same way, "that CALZADILLA was wrong in

limiting limself to a reduced group of persons: whereas:

I will continue to go forward but with everyone, not

just a few."

C. -RUIZ takes a-broader view of Party membership

than his contemporaries.

In commenting on the weekly

study circle for members of the Party, he set forth

his opinion that all the comrades of

Mission should participate even

though. they may not

be members because

in his eyes it is as if they all

really were members.

D.

RUIZ repeated a statement he has made.

On

prerious occasions

- the great interest of his life

is foreign commerce.

However, in this 4 July QUOZE

Report,

he added the interesting detail that he had

not wanted to

come to Madrid as Charge and, in affect,

had been persuaded

to come against his will.

He

believes he is vest able

However, the forner

On 10 January 1968, AMAUTO elected on the international

in one of his many daily

with his

subordinates,

position of his countis, and among the things he said, we quote

the following which may be of possible interest to addressees.

Although part

of the discussion

was not heard because of the

emot tonal inflection of and spearstanda feel that the fist. or

the discussion is clear and understandable.

"We are demonstrating to the world that Cuba..•is

favorably disposed to do whatever... (AMAUTO-1 begins

to talk against the United States) that when the

Americans have to raise the white flag. because the

first plane that appears on radar... (AMAUTO1 1s

speaking excitedly and itis very

difficult to understand

each word but it appears that he is talking about the

positions of missiles in Cuba), Havana, Las Villas and

camaguey and: that with these missiles,

we can cover

Maml, New York, and all their bases and all of their

"mierda".

• • if

the Americans say they are going to

sad them (misuiles? planes?), we will send

them; if

they (Americans) say they are going to invade us, the

first plane that comes to invade... (AHAUTOl's sub-

ordinate remarked that 15 October

62 marked a point

in international politics, when the Yankees ordered

the. Soviets to withdraw

their missiles). • •(AMAUTO1

injected) "they (the Soviets) presented

them (the

Cubans) with ten bombs".

Our reason for reporting this fragmentary information is

that ANAUTO-1 might be confirming the presence of offensive mis-

siles in Cuba.

following his arrival in Spain, the

Due mic five o annist ate matter, pro and artened vas,

subject of propaganda will be dealt with in this dispatch.

2.

The Castro regime has always attached great

importance to propaganda activities of all kinds and when the

new Cuban Charge d'Affaires began to re-organize the work of

his subordinates, propaganda matters were not overlooked.

According to the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations,

the

provincial consulates have been receiving four

types of

propaganda for distribution,

two of which were identified.

One was the propaganda put out by the organizations created

by the Castro regine,

for example "The Voice of Vietnam".

The other is newspapers.

PACHECO, Consul in Sevilla,

mentioned Granma,

which

he claimed many people read,

and

added that lately he had been receiving Juventude Rebelde.

RUIZ's ideas apparently go beyond hand-shaking and

the distribution of propaganda.

He asked the consuls to

make & list of all the institutes and all the scientific

centers in their territories including the special positions

of these centers and any other relevant information. They

are to use these lists to develop a systematic work

• Of visiting each one, making friends,

CALZADILLA, RUIZ's predecessor had not been a strong

administrator and had let the various components of the

Cuban official establishment in Spain run their own affairs.

This fact plus the inevitable tendency of a new chief to be

"new broom" and rearrange things according to his own

led Station Madrid to expect some changes particularly

the Embassy.

the QUDOZE and QUTIMID operations

have shown RUIZ at

least initially to be an aggressive and

well organized individual with ideas of his own that clearly

reflect his background in commercial affairs and prepared to

make changes that promise to go beyond the superficial

sweeping of a new broom.

Underlying RUIZ's actions and

proposals is the clear implication that he came to Madrid

with the specific task of upgrading the cuban mission in

Spain both in terms of prestige and eftectiveness.

Madrid will transmit to the addressees the relevant

information on this program as it becomes available from the

and QUTINID operations along with information on the

official Cuban personalities administering the program.

A striking difference between RUIZ and his

predecessor was noted in the QUDOZE and QUTIMID reports of

This situation has been alleviated by

staff members jaunting out to the airport at

will to meet the incoming planes.

RUIZ has declared

that the rest of the staff must stay in the Embassy

because

they have a

work plan to fulfill.

Thus, he has left himself

with an unresolved

problem he must face

in the very near

future.

The new Ambassador concluded his report with three

recommendations:

3. Reit another building where the Chancillary,

the Commercial Office,

the Consulate and

the

Cubana Offices can all be housed instead

of

being dispersed in separate buildings as they

are now;

b.

Rent or preferably buy a residence for the Chief

of Mission.

The one they now have is not

adequate;

C.

Send another person from Cuba who has the.

background to take care of scientific work plus

continuing the contacts the Mission will 'have

already made

In view of RUIZ's provious

statement on the completeness of the staff, such

a person would likely be a

"non-official"

representative of one of Cuba's cultural fronts

such as the Casa de las Americas.

RUIZ concluded his remarks

by saying that in Spain

there is a tremendous field

for the Cubans,

they have no

language problem and they can do a great work.

Such is the

goal RUIZ has proclaimed and that Station Madrid believes

he was sent to attain.
