SUBJECT: Richard E, SNYDER
: (born 10 Dec, 1919, Passaic, N.J.}

r

1. ‘You advised me that Robert KENNEDY of OP had called
you, asking:about Subject's file (apparently he retired as
a Foreign Service Officer (20.years, age 50) on 30 April
1970; he would like to do some work, on project or part-
time basis). You asked if I knew of any reason why Mr.
BURNES had requestéd flagging of OP file “to be sure in-
quirics would be referred to CD/Pers for further check with

RI files"?

2, Subject is the subject of CS file 201-748009, re-
stricted to CI/R&A (Paul HARTMAN)... From the file it is
noted that Subject worked for CIA 27 Mar. ‘50-26 Sept.

"SO, resigning for personal reasons. The file was restricted
because of involvement with Lee Harvey OSWALD, assassin of
the.late President John Kennedy. While Subject was 2nd
Secretary at the US Embassy in Moscow , on 31 Oct. 1959, he
interviewed Lee Harvey OSWALD, when OSWALD appeared at the
US-Embassy, stating that he wished to renounce his US
citizenship and become a citizen of the USSR. (“y revi
shows nothing reflecting adversely on Subject in connection
with that episode). An article in the 26 Feb. 1964 edition
of’ the Northern Virginia Sun, written by Robert S. ALLEN and
and Paul SCOTT, alleged that "State Department records show
that OSWALD had several meetings with the CIA representative
in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. .+.One State Department
cable, No. 234, dated Nov. 2, 1959, reports that OSWALD was
interviewed by the CIA and other embassy officials." Ina
memorandum dated 18 March 1964, addressed to Mr, J, Lee
RANKIN, subject "Article Alleging that OSWALD Was Interviewed
by CIA in Moscow", Mr. Richard Helms, then Deputy Director
for Plans, commented on the allegation as follows: "I desire
to state for the record that the allegation carried in this
press report is utterly unfounded as far as CIA is concerned,
