IIL. WHAT TARGETS WAS THE AGENCY ABLE TO COVER AND WITH WHAT
FREQUENCY AND CONTINUITY? an

The following remarks apply to agent coverage only, that is,
coverage by means of individuals on the island of Cuba, or elsewhere
in the world. Audio devices or telephone taps on Cuban installations
abroad or Cubans living abroad have produced intelligence which hag
served operational ends, in other words, information which has pro~
vided critical data used in the spotting, assessment and recruit-
ment of agents. Due to the standard security measures taken in
most official installations, these technical operations have been
able to provide only a limited amount of positive intelligence. In
general, agents have produces information essentially in accordance
with their known access at the time of recruitment. Responsibility
for many of the agents dealt with during the present reporting period
was simply assumed by TFW from past efforts against Cuba. In many
instances, these agents had been recruited strictly on an “availa-
bility" basis, and indeed had no particular access. A major effort
was made at the inception of TFW to winnow out those persons who —
could make no contribution and to redirect those who could. This
process of redirection, which was conducted via time consuming and
generally inefficient S/W channels, resulted in the conversion of
a number of heretofore unusable agents into sound, pertinent report-
ing sources. Though, in most instances, TFW operations officers
had never had personal contact with these agents, they succeeded
in inducing many of them to spot, develop and recruit sub-agents.
This technique succeeded, despite the obstacles involved in
vetting candidates and advising agents via S/W means. In regard
to the recruitment of new agent assets during the reporting period,

- {FW was able to be guided by specific, priority needs. Accordingly,

the many new assets acquired were chosen because of specific access
to target personalities or institutions. The assigned targets and
extent of coverage are indicated below.

A. Military

During the reporting period, in the latter half, the Agency's
major effort to obtain intelligence from agent sources, centered
on Cuban military affairs. The reporting obtained covered matters
ranging from military policy to detailed OB. Almost every agent
contributed to this effort, with the consequence that the coverage
of military matters was wide-spread and continuous. Despite the
fact that 95% of this information was provided via S/W (much of it

‘from totally untrained sub-sources who had no military experience),

such was the detail and volume of the data, that our agents were
able to give us highly significant information on troop and materiel’
movements, location and nature of military sites, etc. The follow-
ing agents served as the major sources of military iffformation
during the reporting period:

-net, provided intelligence in late June 1962 which specifically
anticipated the massive Soviet military build-up which ultimately - wee
took place in Cuba. Throughout ‘the build-up itself this agent -
provided an almost continuous stream of OB intelligence on errs
i maritime and air phases of the build-up. He provided the initial
che “ yeporting on delivery of IL-28's to the island.

b. Political. Throughout the reporting period, the Agency was
able to produce intelligence on Cuban political affairs at the
ministerial level and above. This intelligence was derived
essentially from sources who had but limited access to persons of .
high rank or in key positions. This type of access placed a premium
on Agent elictation skills and the ability to distinguish between
rumor and fact, plus an aptitude for remaining afloat in dangerous
waters, The most significant political information was provided

by the following agents: of
1. An official Gn the of )who, (in the
capacity of advisor to Ernesto RA) was able to glean informa-

tion on Cuban political affairs.

c. Economic. The Agency was able to produce a continuous amount
of intelligence from Agent sources on the Cuban sugar, oil and trang-
portation industries, much of which was in the form-of statistical
summaries, Ina number of instances, this intelligence was pro-
vided by agents who had direct access to this information by virtue
of their jobs.. We also have been able to get continued reporting
on general economic conditions and foreign trade. Among the most
significant agents aay cast economic information were;

dad. Sociological and General Conditions. The Agency has
provided a steady and relatively heavy flow of intelligence -
covering such matters as tho state of resistance activities, mood
of the populace, living conditions, etc., from agents in nearly
every Cuban province. A survey of agents reporting this type
of information has not been completed, because almost all of our
agents have reported on this low priority topic from time to time,

4, Within the Terms of the Agency's Mission, What Target '
Was It Unable to Cover and Way?

a. Paragraph 3 above sets forth in general the degree to
which the major Cuban targets were covered during the reporting



24

3lny

period, The key military, political and economic targets were
clearly defined and assiduously pursued by TIW. The immense
pressure of time must continuously be borne in mind if the attack
on the Cuban problem is to be granted its. full perspective... Even
before TFW assumed responsibility for collection against Cuba,

it was clear that intelligence on Soviet, Satellite and Chinese
Communist Cuban policy and maneuvers would be formulated and
planned at.the highest level in the respective governments.
Equally clear was the fact that the clandestine search for in-
sights into the Cuban policies of these governments would enjoy
only as much success as the clandestine search for any intelligence
regarding any policies of these governments. Time restrictions
alone ruled out the hope that adequate coverage of these key
denied area targets could be achieved. As a consequence, every
facet of the TFW collection program was geared to the search for
top priority Cuban intelligence; from sources in the free world
and on the island every agent or agent candidate was evaluated in
terms of his access. to such intelligence. Translated into
espionage terms, this meant that every agent or candidate was
examined sharply to determine whether and how he could help
penetrate the GOC, the Cuban armed forces or the managerial and
policy levels of the Cuban economy. Below is an account of the
success of this effort; it will be seen that most major target
areas were under direct, specific assault.

b. Political.

candidate provided highly valuable information throughout the
sunmer of 1962, Though the information was obtained indirectly
by the agent it was but a portion of what he could produce. Thus
the ultimate aim of the operation was to effect the candidate's
direct recruitment. The drive toward this goal continues, and
though we are optimistic that the 6 months effort thus far in-
1_result in the direct recruitment of a high-level
member, it would be in: e@ to say that as of
e close 0. @ reporting period, thet [had been penetrated
at a significant level. 29 :

2. GOC Ruling Circle.

(a) .In May 1962 TFW spotted a Cuban legal
traveller whose brother-in-law has been a member of the GOCC
from its inception. The agent was recruited under specific
instructions to attempt to induce his relative to report on GOC
policy matters. Though TFW had only 12 hours with the agent

Uf ws



cenantiel

py

C

before dispatching him to Cuba, he has attempted to carry out .

his instructions. By October he had succeeded in eliciting
significant information from the target, and was confident his i ees
full recruitment was simply a matter of time, One inhibiting

feature affecting the pace of this operation is the fact that

the agent lives in Santiago while his relative, the target, is

o resident of Havana. Unquestion:bly the full recruitment of

the target could help fill an important gap in our reporting ~

on GOC activities.

(b) In June 1962 TFW obtained a lead to a
person very closely related to Fidel CASTRO. Throughout the
summer extensive but necessarily circumspent negotiations were
conducted to bring this person to Mexico where full recruitment,
training and briefing would be possible. The negotiations
culminated in success, The agent was met and trained by Agency
personnel in September and early October and dispatched to Cuba f
on 15 October with the specific mission of reporting on the t wa
thoughts, plans and activities of the CASTROS and other leading

' GOC figures. Since the target, prior to recruitment did not \

possess the kind of political awareness which would have led him
systematically to observe those GOC personalities to whom he

had matural access, the Agency was denied any prime political
intelligence from this source during the. reporting period.

(c) Throughout the summer 1962, TFW
received various reports, the tenor of which were that Ernesto
*Che' GUEVARA would like to defect from.Cuba. Each report proved,
upon closer inquiry, to bé groundless, until we learned in late
September that a Mexican industrialist had claimed GUEVARA had
asked him in 1961 for assistance in leaving Cuba. Though many
of the facets of this disclosure tallied with other known data,
exploitation of this exceedingly important lead was hamstrung by
the inability to aline a qualified agency officer with the widely:
travelling Mexican. This lead illustrates well the frustrations
involved in pursuing high-level targets within a rigid time
framework, and with a limited number of available personnel,

It also illustrated the need to persist, when the target is of
sufficient importance, in the follow up of "“far-out" leads.

to develop the target and was able to provide significant OB -
at the same time. Neither this, nor the other efforts to
penetrate the Cuban military at high-level, however, had met
with full suceess by the end of the reports period.

ob (b) The Cuban lawyer recruited in May 1962
(see paragraph above) developed a second target in September,
a former member(of the [ now awaiting reassigne
ment, The agent was instructed to recruit and train this |
military Officer in S/W. At the end of the reporting period
it was not possible to determine the success of this note
excellent operational devolopment.

(c) Included in this discussion is the
partially successful recruitment of a Cuban army engineer who.
is stationed in Santiago. The agent cited in (2b above) has
beon in contact with this target, a captain, since July 1962,
but has not succeeded in completing the full recruitment. He
has obtained OB from the captain, but we feel the operation
will not have reached its full potential until the captain has
been trained in S/W and is reporting directly to us. .

(d) Since mid-August the Agency has been
pursuing a lead to the G-3 of the Cuban Army. The basis of this
pursuit was fitted together from innumerable reports, and finally
centered, in early October, on a plan to try to effect the reoruit-
ment using a letter from a former army and prison comrade. By
cut-off date, the developmental activity had reached the point
where the only remaining matter was to deliver the letter into
the hands of the Officer.

3. Economic. The Agency has striven to identify key
figures in the Cuban 6conomy and to develop agSess to them as
rapidly as possible, wherever the opportunity has arisen. Oil,

no exception. Numerous well-meaning persons in the U.S. have
attempted to help us obtain access to this critical target. Yet
not until late September was the Agency able to turn up (by
virtue of a Now Orleans recruitment) a source of viable leads
to key personnel. By cut-off date, however, we had not been able
to bring any lead to function. Most promising is a lead to the

To illustrate the results of this opecational data, we have
recently been preparing the recruitment in place or defection of
one of the principal officers of the Cuban Foreign Service in
Europe. We have been able to develop the proposals through an
already defected diplomat and the effectiveness of his approach
and a reading on the diplomats reactions can be provided to us
independently by three other agents in close contact with him as
well as through a technical surveillance operation.

v. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, EITNER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN
THE AGENCY'S COVERAGE CAPABILITY, WHICH TOOX PLACE DURING THE

PERIOD.

The initial, significant change effected by the Agency to
increase and improve its Cuban intelligence coverage capability
was to establish a Cuban Task Force at Headquarters and to
staff it with experienced intelligence officers. These officers
were selected from other operating Divisions within the Agency.
Many of them spoxe Spanish and all of them have had extensive
experience in various intelligence assignments both at Headquarters
and in the Field. This newly created Task Force was charged with
the responsibility to direct, advise, support, and/or coordinate
all phases of the Agency’ s intelligence operations directed
against Cuba.

At the same time, the Task Force Field Station in Miami was
strengthened considerably with increased. numbers of experienced
staff officers and facilities for mounting intelligence operations
against the Cuban target. This concentration of experienced
personnel into the Cuban Task Force, both at Headquarters and at
the Miami Field Station, was a positive and significant effort to
increase the Agency's intelligence coverage capability -in order.
to satisfactorily fulfill the priority requirements and tasks
which had been levied on the Agency as a result of the Comnunist .
takeover in Cuba. ;

In addition to setting up within the Agency an organization
whose primary mission is concerned with all phases of intelligence
operations directed against Cuba, all other operating Divisions
within the Agency wére directed to give top priority attention to
the development of intelligence operations against Cuba. This_has
resulted in the diversion of certain assets who had the requisite
access to Cuban targets as well as the experience or capability.

Tip/ -


The response of the various Agency components, both by Head-
quarters Desks and by the Field Stations, has been most satis-
factory and has aided the Task Force considerably in the perform=-
ance of its assigned mission. Within the Task Force, selected
officers have been designated to assist, advise, and coordinate
on all phases of Cuban intelligence operations with the various
geographic division desks. This arrangement has provided for a
continued, increased coverage capability of the Cuban target by
insuring a regular review of current, developmental, and planned
intelligence operations of all available Agency intelligence
assets which could be directed against Cuba.

The above points are ones that reflect significant changes
which have taken place during this period. In addition, it
should be pointed out that there has been an intensification
and concentration of all operational techniques applicable to
the particular type and character of the Cuban target. There
has been a substantial increase in the recruitment and training
of agent assets. There has been an extensive increase in the
establishment and use of clandestine communications methods and
channels. The use of SW, one way voice radio, and WT as. methods

of communicating ts insi: ap Cuba has been greatly expandéd.
And ‘singe certain till maintain Embassies in -
Havana’, channels for the delivery Of and

by the have been developed and are being usad_

. extensively.?4The above points are discussed elsewhere in this

paper but they are mentioned here briefly in the context of being
closely related to significant changes in the Agency's intelligence
capability.

VI. WHAT SUPPORT FOR COLLECTION FACILITIES-WAS REQUIRED

“ FROM OTHER AGENCIES? HOW WAS IT SECURED FROM THEM? WAS IT TIMELY

AND EFFECTIVE? WHAT, IF ANYTHING, WAS LACKING?

The conduct of intelligence collection operations often
has depended on timely and effective support from other U.S. govern=
ment agencies. Several government agencies provided support to
intelligence operations directed against the Cuban target on both a
regular and a standby basis. In fact, each and every request for
policy approved support was granted and carried out rapidly and
effectively. For example, the Department of State has expedited the |
issuance of visas on selected cases at our request as well as granting
visa waivers to individuals of operational interest to the Agency.
In addition, Foreign Service personnel interview, debrief, and attempt

“to establish the bona-fides of potential intelligence assets who

voluntarily contact a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. This is often done
alone and some times in collaboration with an agency officer prior
to introducing the agency officer for further development and ex
ploitation as the case may require. These types of support are
provided regularly by the Department of State and contribute consid~
erably to the effectiveness of many complex intelligence operations.

Another U.S. government agency which has given invaluable
support to the Agency's intelligence collection operations is the FBI.
The FBI has provided biographic data, investigative reports, and
operational leads to individuals of known or potential operational ' -
interest. This support has been maintained on a regular and continuing
basis. Close liaison relations between the FBI and this agency are
maintained at Headquarters and at various Field Stations. This close
liaison has resulted-in a better understanding of the needs and

. requirements of each Agency in the successful accomplishments of

their separate responsibilities as well as providing a rapid channel
for providing support and assistance when requested.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has facil=
itated the entry into the U.S. of persons of operational interest
to the Agency; and has provided guidance and support for cases which
involve unusual alien residence and/or naturalization proceedings.
Liaison with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service is
particularly close and harmonious at the Miami Field installation
where the bulk of the cases involving persons of operational interest
to us originates.

Reports provided on a regular basis by the National Security
Agency have been a source of operational leads which have been followed

Liaison with the aforementioned U.S. government agencies
is maintained.on a Gdmtinuing and regular basis both at the Headquarters
level in Washington, D.C. and at appropriate field installations by
designated Agency components. It has been our pleasurable experience
that these agencies, in addition to others such as the Department of
Agriculture where specific operations required guidance in their par-
ticular fields of competence, have provided timely, effective, and
professional support and guidance, in support of policy approved

Without such support, the task of.intelligence collection would tave
been in many instances much more difficult and, in many cases, impossible

VII. AGENT SUMMARIES

The scope and nature of the Agency's Foreign Intelli-
gence operations 1s most clearly seen in the character, personal
ambition and caprice of the human material present, namely the
agents involved. The following sketches of the individual agents
engaged in these operations have been compiled in recognition of
the vital ingredient which these human beings bring to an apprecia-
tion of the Agency's FI operations. It will be noted that a
majority of the agents work, or have been worked, out of Miami,
the city which has been the center of anti-Castro Cubans, the
major pool of potential agents, since 1959.

Other geographical areas are represented in mathematical
sequence, in fact according to the number of Cuban exiles in
residence at a given place, This same mathematical order applies
with reference to the jobs these agents hold. Thus, if a Cuban
has a function, the performance of which is important in sustain-
ing the island, hence important to the Cuban Regime, the Agency

“has sought the services of this man as ny 24 For n,
_several agents are in the employ of the and of| Pf
businesses. So too, wi iplomacy. Every foreign

diplomat now ac¢redited to the Regime in Havana has been examined
by the Agency as'a prospective agent. Forty percent of these diplo-
mats were approached. Of this number about one half took our bait
and have accepted assignments which range from marginal involvement
in "intelligence" (e.g., using their diplomatic immunity to carry
our materials), to active participation in our operations.

Finally, one type of Cuban who played an influential,
though limited, role during the past six months was the defector
(who is not méntioned elsewhere in this paper). The defector is
the official who for one reason or another cannot remain in or be
persuaded to-remain in place and report on his job. Owing to the
nature of this particular person, it is difficult to draw hard
lines between those who genuinely reject their Government and those
who merely quit in self-interest, but during the past six months,
the Agency tapped in on the defections of atout ten Cubans of
consequence, prvfiting from their information in all cases and
from their psychological exploitation when circumstance would permit,
