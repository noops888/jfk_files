under the escort of revel guides, Inthe course of approximately twenty
daye' stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headduarters, during which
time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied

Manzanillo on 26 March 1958. At Manzanillo, Vaiveda broke off contact with :
2 the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana. 7

3. During his relatively short stay in the Sierra Maestra mountains, :
Vaivada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational : 1
information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic
coverage of his trip. '

past performances of Arthur G, Vaivada, who has always shown a deep devotion.

MEMORANDUM

Ay the Warvadae

SUBJECT: subject of our letter miiser 4U25; interest in Assignment
in U. 5,

1. In recent conversations with both JRP and ROS; Subject has
broachea tne prospect of a possible assignment within the U.S, follow-
ing completion of nis Habana assignrent. He says ne would not wat his
Statements re reassignment which wore recently forwarded to Headquartars
to be interproted to mean tnat he is not interested inau. 5S, tour. He
says that he mas been giving micn thought to his future career, as well
a5 to the needs of nis family, He points out that ne personally nas now
Spent approximately lo years, excepting vacations and short training
perioas, living ma working outside tne U. S., that nis two cnilaren
have never lived tnere, and that vota he and his wile are concerned
that too mich time will elajse before they can provide their children
witn a period in the U. 3, during their formative years,

2. It is the opinion of both KUS and JkP that Subject is at a
Point in his career development wnere a tour at Heaiquarters would
be extremly beneficial, The Station lacks knowledge conceming the
Specific Heaaquarters jobs to which a person of Subjects status might
be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR soretines employs
these persons as instructors. ie believe that a tour with OTK would
not only remedy in great measure deficiencies in Sudjest’s backyround
caused by lack of iieadquarters experience, but would at the same time
afford Ui excellent instructor material,

3. In view of Subject’s own interest in sucn am assignment, and
our estimate of tas potential value to him and to the Organization
that would accrue from it, we recomend that Heaiquarters arrange such
am assignment if at all possible,

Ue In view of the likelihood of Subject’s transfer in the near
future, a prompt decision is requested.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

SUBJECT t Request for Conversion cf Arthur Gs YATPADA From
Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE, + HXH-A-2577

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion
of contract, agent arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents
4 strong case for such conversion. VAIViDA has served CUA in a con=
tract capacity since 1949, wita a continuous high level of perzor-
mance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. ie is cure
rently assigned to Cuba and is expected to remain there indefinitely.
VAIVADA ts 3h years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent
of @ GS-10 rating. His expressed cereer interests lie in eontimued
employment by CIA, more especially in the area ofunofficial cover
assignments, for which he is highly suited.

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) 4s a Costa Rican
citizen, a eituation which complicates his proposed conversion som=
what. She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, hovever,
and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the next
Several months, barring unforeseen developaents. She will be required

“to spend most of this period in the U.S. and 4s currently making

plans, to do.so.

3. In view of VAIVADAts oatstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications, and his excressed desire for a
career with CIA, it is recomended that he be eranted staff status
at grade GS-11, contingent uron his wife's first becoming a U.S.
citizen, and providing he can meet Security and-other requirements.
There is available in #H Division a staf!. position (BAF-09) to
which VAIVADA can be assigned.

4, WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for
covert training in the near future.

5. Approval for the conversion ‘of VAIVADA from contract to
staff status, as indicated above, is hereby requested,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 2 Proposed Staff Status for arthur. G. VAIVADA
REFERENCE 1 HEH-A-2577, 17 April 1956

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recomeenis the conversion
of contract ‘agent Arthur C. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a
good case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract
capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of performance; first
in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is°3h years old and
was promoted recently to the equivalent. of a grade GS-10. His ex-
pressed career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more
specially in the area of unofficial cover assignments, for which
he is highly suited.

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 19h5) 1s a Costa:

Rican citizen. Prelininary investigation at Headquarters bas revealed
that Subject's conversion to staff status is virtually out of the
question so long as hia wife remains an alien. It has also been de~
termined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizensip withia
@ span of h5 days if ehe so desires and is willing to. come to the
U.S. for that period of tine, This would remove the major. stumbling
block to acquisition of staff status for VAIVADA. “4

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a ca-
reer with CIA, it is recommended that (a) VAIVADA's wife be encoursged
to seek U.S. citizenship under the terms outlined above (b) VAIVADA
be granted staff status, contingent upon his wife's first becoming
a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other requirements
C/WH/TII has endorsed the récomendation for staff status and a sug-
gestion by C/WH/Admin that BAF-L09, & new position currently alloted
to San Jose, be: transferred to Habana to'be filled by VAIVADA.

kh, It is further reccamenied that WH Division consider bring-

“ing VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincide with his wife's

stay (at Headquarters! convenience). This would. facilitate acquisi-
tion of citizenship for the wife and at thé same time afford VAIVADA : fie
a chance for additional Headquarters training. . Subject previously . a

1. Enclosed herewith is the outline of an idea in xeering with the
nature of this notional cover plan‘of a temporary nature, Careful
consideration has been given to a number of i any ait of which were
rejected because vossible local conflicts. This idea is still general
enough (and I hope convincing) to leave opportunity for enanges and/or
improvexent at Headquarters. The idea, and the terminology, was
gleaned from the pages of "Investrent in Cuba", a July 1956 study
published by the U.S. Department of Comerce,

2. As I understand this cover arrangement, the P31 should mail ne
a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed information, This
should "hold us" for a couple of vonths, with possibly some queries from
me occasionally, Then when our operational picture requires investigation
in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to
request a survey or poll in that field.

3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and
allied materials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration
of this “Agency” and then advise PSI as to the legal requirezent,
