METORANDUX POR: Ciel, FI/Staff

SUBJECT:

Arthur Go VAIVADA - Request for Frozotion....

1. •It is requested that Arthur G. Vaivada, a Career Agent, be promoted

from GS-11 to grade GS-12 for his outstanding performance in carrying out a

precarious mission in line with the objectives of Profect AMPHODARCH, In

which he is the Principal igent.

2.

In early January 1958, Vaivada volunteered to undertake a mission to

contact Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro Ruz in the Sierra Maestra mountains

In south-eastern Cuba.

He arranged for his free passage into the Sierras

through contacts within the 26 July Movement which he and the Station.

developed earlier.

After the necessary arrangements, Vaivada left La Habana

on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras

under the escort of rebel guides. In the course of approximately twenty

days' stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquarters, during which

time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied

Castro and a force of about 200 rebels on their dawn attack on the town of

Manzanillo on 26 March 1958. At Manzanillo, Vaivada broke off contact with

the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana.

3. During his relatively short stay in the Sierra Maestra mountaing,

Valvada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational

information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographie

coverage of his trip.

This exploit is another achievement to be added to the impressive

past performances of Arthur G. Vairada, who has always shown a deep devotion.

to his work and to the igency.

5. Valvada has born on I

and has been dth CIA since 1949.

He has been a career agent since i June 1957, ana was promoted to the grade

of GS-1l on 1 June 1957 His tour of duty in Cuba was from August 195% until

31 March 1958.

MEMORA DUM

SUBJECT:

Hollers

Veivara

subject of our letter nuber 4025; interest in Assignment

in U.s.

1.

In recent conversations with both JRe and ROS, Subject hag

broached the prospect of a possible assignment within the U.s. follow-

ine completion of his Mabana assignrent.

He says he would not want his

statenents

re reassignment which were recently forwarded to Headquarters

to be interprated to nean that he is not interested in a u.S. tour.

ile

sajs that he has been giving mich thought to his future career, as well

as to the needs of his family.

no points out that he personally has now

spent approximately. 16 years, excepting

vacations and short training

periods, living ma working

outside the U. So, that nis two chilaren

have never lived there, and that doth he and his wile are concerned

that

too much time will elapse before they can provide their children

with a period in the U.S. auring their forkative years.

2.

It is the opinion of both KUS and JHP that Subject is at a

point in his carser developtent where a tour at Headquarters would

be extremely beneficial.

The Station lacks knowledge concering the

specific readquarters jobs to which a person of subject's status might

be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR soretimes employs

these persons as instructors. le believe that a tour with UTh would

not only renedy in great measure deficiencies in Subjest's background

caused by Lack of Headquarters experience, but would at the sane time

afford ViR excellent instructor material.

3. In view of Subject's own interest in such an assignment, and

our estinate of tos potential value to him and to the Organization

that would accrue from it, we recommend tnat Headquarters arrange such

an assignment 1f at all possible.

4o In view of the likelihood of Subject's transfer in the near

future, a prompt decision is requested.

SUBJECT

8 Request for conversion of Arthur GoATNADA FrOM

Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE

: HKH-A-2577

1.

Referenced dispatch fron the field recormands the conversion

of contract, agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status,

and presents

& strong case for

such conversion.

VAlVADA has served CIA in a con-

tract capacity since 1949, witia a continuous high lavel of perfor-

mance; first in Costa Rica,

later in Guatenald and Cuba.

he is cur-

rently assigned to Cuba and is expectat to remain there indefinitely.

VAIVADA Is 34 years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent

of & GS-10 rating.

His expressed career interests lie in contired

employment by CIA, more especially in the area ofunofficial cover

assignments, for which he is highly suited.

2.

Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1915) 1s a Costa Pican

citizen, a situation which complicates his proposed conversion sone-

what.

She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, hovever,

and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the zext

several months, barring unforeseen developaents. She will be required

to spend most of this period in the U.S. and is currently saling

plans. to do. so.

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,

his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a

career with CIA, it is recommended that he be granted staff status

at grade CS-11,

contingent upon his wife's first beconing a U.S.

citizen, and providing he can meet Security and other requirements.

There 1s available in iH Division a staff position (BAF-409) to

which VAIVADA can be assigned.

4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for

covert training in the near future.

5.

Approval for the conversion of VAIVADi from contract to

staff status, as indicated above, 18 hereby requested.

Considering the possibility that such a reavest might be

turned down, the undersigned discussed with

the proce-

dures for acquisition of citizenship for Mrs. VAIVADA, and deter-

minad that this should be relatively simple.

The requirements were!

presence in the U.3. (vicinity of Washington) for approxinately

forty-live days with some additional time to acquire passport.. So

long as we have nothing that would make her inadmissable to the U.S.,

the basic requiremente would be: ability to speak English and to

pass a relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be given

to her for study.

Security would presumably handle her case when

she arrives in the States.

3. It has occurred to the undersigned that perhaps, 1f 1t 18

necessary for Mrs, VAIVADA to acquire citizenship, VAIVADA hisself

could be brougas to the washingio vicinity for irmining purposes

In order to facilitate the visit of his wife, expenses,. etc. This

would at the sane time afford an opportunity to provide VAIVADA

8 Proposed Staff Status for Arthur. G. VAIVADA

HKH-4-2577, 17 April 1956

lo Referenced dispatch from the field recoumends the conversion

of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a

good case for such convergion.

VAIVADA has served CIA 10 & contract

capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of parformance; firat

1n Costs Rica, later in Guatenala and Cuba. He 1a 3u years old and

was pronoted recently to the equivalent of a grade GS-10. His ex-

proased career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more

especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments; for which

he is highly suited.

2.

Unfortung tely Subject's spouse (since 1945) 15 a Costa:

Rican citizen.

Prelininary investigation at Headquarters bas revealed

that subject's conversion to staff status is virtually out of the

question so long as his vife remains an alien... It has also been de

termined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizenghip vithin

& span of 15 days If she so desires and 18 willing to come to the

J.S. for that period of time.

This would remove the major stumbling

block to acquisition of staff status for VAIVADA.

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract ageat,

his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a ca-

reer vito CIA, it 18 recomended that (a) VAIVADA*s wife be encourszed

so seek U.S. Citizensbip under the terme outlined above (b) VAIVADA

be granted staff status, contingent upon his wife's first becoming

a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other requiremente.

C,WH/III has endorsed the récommendation for staff status and a sug-

gestion by C/WH/Adinin that BAP-409, a new position currently alloted

to San Jose, be transferred to Habana to be filled by VAIVADA.

I. It is further recomended tbat i Division consider bring

1ng VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincide with bis mife's

This would facilitate acquisi

a chance for additional Headguarters training. Subject previously

received covert training at Headquarters fron 5 October through 25

Hovember 1953.

Careful

consideration has been given to a mumber of ideas, all of which vere

rejected because possible local conflicts.. This idea is still general

enough (and I hope contincing) to leave opportunity for changes ard/or

improvenent at Headquarters.

The idea, and the terrinology, was

gleaned from the pages of "Investrent in Cuba", a July 1955 study

published by the U.S. Department of Commerce,

As I understand this cover arrengement, the isi should mail me

a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed infornation.

should "hold us" for a couple of months, with possibly some queries fron

me occasionally.

Then when our operational picture requires investigation

in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to

request a survey of poll

in that field..

3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and

allied naterials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration

of this "Agency" and ther advise PSI as to the legal requirement.

NEHORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Vaivada

Lo During the morning of 30 April Mr.

phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508.

r. los cover taie-

said that

he would be meeting with Vairada at 1500 hours today and proposed

providing him with a temporary rather than permanent cover with

the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range

development. Ur.

reasoning was that he did not wish

to place Vaivade under the new company with the chance that the

triai perioi approved for the Station might cause Vaivada to be

pulled out from that.cover in short order.

kro

said that

the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.

2. I concurred with the above proposal.

visional covert security approsal is granted for the use of the

Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph #l,

3.

a request for approval to cover pny proposed change should bo subaiitad

to this office.
