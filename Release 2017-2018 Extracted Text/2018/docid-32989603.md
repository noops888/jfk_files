MEVORANDUM FOR MR. FOOTER;

DIRECTOR,

FEDERAL BUREAU CE INESCICANTON

This will refer to your menorandun of November 2? with

reference to the harwis Childs column appearing in The Hashington

Post on Novenber 19, 1947 and to your letters of Lovember 21, the

one addressed to lix. Childs and the other addressed to tir. Paul A.

walker, Acting Chairman, Federal Cormunications Commission.

It 1s my view that the Bureau's practice of passing along

to the various Government departments and agencies information

which comes to its attention in connection with the conduct of

Investigations normally and regularly within the Bureau's juris-

diction is entirely appropriate and correct. Indeei, ii vould

appear that the Bureau would be remiss in its duty if it falled

to pess alone incormation coming to li which might prove to be

In the interest of the general welfare. It is not the Bureau's

responsibility to determine whether the information is or is not

of importance to the particular agency in the carrying out of its

current activities and responsibilitins and whether on not any

action is taken by the department of agency is not, of course, a

principal concern of the Bureau.

I believe, therefore, that the Bureau should continue its

practice o1 passing along infornation which it is believed might

be of interest to the various departments ana agencies.

sane time I believe that it would be appropriate either (a) to

prepare a circular to the various departments and agencies explain-

Ing the Bureau's purpose in furnishing information fron time to

tine, or (b) to make a particular effort for a tine when trans

nitting indiridual-items of infornation to explain in the trans

mittal menorandun the Bureau's purpose in making such transmittal.

Mr. Paul A. Walker

•Acting Chairman

Federal Cormunications Cormission

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mc. Walkes:

Under date of November 18, 1947, there appeared in the column of

Mr. Marquis Childs in the Washington Post the following statement attributed

to Mc. Clifford J. Durr of the Federal Communications Cormission:

the FBI is funishing to the commission unsolicited serosts on individuals

connected with radio, and I can assure you that if you should be told the

kind of things contained in many of these reports you would dismiss the infor-

mation as baseless gossip."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has referred to the Federal

Communications Cormission from time to time information which it has received

in the course of its regular investigations which appeared pertinent or raterial

to matters within the jurisdiction of the Cormission.

It is the policy and

practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid any atiempts to eval-

vate the significance of information relating to matters without its juris-

"diction or the effect of such information upon the contemporary policies and

programs of other agencies. As a resuli, the Bureau furnishes to the

various

Government departments such information as it receives which appears pertinent

to the operations of those Government departments. In so far as is practicale,

the Bureau attempts to evaluate the reliability of the source of this infor-

mation. tithoud atiempting to make

any suggestions as to the use which should

"or should not be made of the information itself.

Mr. Childs, in his colum quoting Mr. Durr's statement, adds the

'unsolicited'.

It indicates that the FBI initiated investigations and sought io influence

ECC decisions by sending reports on certain individuals to the commission.

I desire to advise you that this Bureau has not at any time attempted

In any manner of degree to influence FCC decisions.

The naterial wich has

Information, it vas believed; might be of interest to the official activities.

In the light of the statements made by Mr. Durr, and since these

statements have not been repudiated by any other members of the Federal

Conmunications Commsssion, I must assume that the material which the Bureau

has been funishing io the Cormission is not desired by the Cormission. I

• am consequen ily discontinuing the transmittal of such data to the Cormission

upon the assumption that the material is of no interest to the Commission.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

MI. J. Edgar Hoover

Director; FBI

DATE: Jung 25,. 1953_

220684:

FROM.

Wiliam P. Rogers,

Deputy Attorney General

-SUBJECTS

Executive Order 10450.

Security Réquirements for Government Employment:

.......0.11

This is with reference to your memoranda of May 1änd

May I4, 1953, relating to the administration of Executive Order

10÷50.

1. Your opinion that there should be no abuse of the

privilege granted by section 3(3) of the order in filling sensitivel

positions in emergency cases prior to the completion of fill fieia

pre-appointment investigations is well taken.

So, also, isyour

suggestion that the Civil Service Commission, in respect to sec-

tion 3(a), should utilize extreme care in permitting less than

the minimum investigation with résuect to per diem, intermittent,

temporary, or seasonable employees and aliens employed outside

the United

States.

2.

I agree with your assumption that the coverage of

the order is limited to the Executive Branch of the Government.

However, I do not believe it will be necessary to make specific

provision in the regulations to that effect.

Inasmuch as they

are to be issued separately by and in the name of each executive

branch,department or agency, it will be made clear that they relate

only to the administration of the particular department or agency

concerned.

You also make reference to the tact that centain of the

non-executive branch agencies,

such as the General Accounting Cifice

and the Government: Printing Office, participated in the procedures

prescribed iy Executive Order 9835.

I under-tand this resulted,

not because that order was necessarily applicable to those agencies,

but because they voluntarily adopted procedures similar to those

prescribed by the order.

Executive Order 10450 does not prevent

then from adocting a similar policy in relation to it. The main

question is whether the appropriations of the F2I are sufficient

tọ pay for the investigations. reguired by such agencies.: 1 under-

stand that the appropriations are sufficient with respect to söme

the agencies whose employees are part of the classified civn

service,

such as the General Accounting Cffice,

but not for others hid

such as the Library of Congress:

In the past a system of reimburse

ment was worked out with respect to investigations for agencies not 3rd

covered by existing appropriations.

I would suggest that the Bureau

stood

???e

MH 55015 DooId: 32989603

## Page 33

work out similar procedures with the Civil.Service .Commission and

other interested agencies with respect to Executive Order 10450v Mornin

3. In reference to the problem of the responsibility of

??"

conducting investigations abroad; the Departments of State and Army

were requested by letter date June oto instan

abroad as existed under Execütive Gider No. 9835. The letter stated

that in the absence of any indication of disagreement with this plan,

it would be assumed that the existing arrangement would remain in

effect. To date no expressions of disagreement have come from

either Department.

4. In respect to the re-adjudication question arising

under section 1, I agree that the Bureau should conduct additional

investigations only when their purpose is to develop information

of the type described in section 3(d). However, I believe the

Civil Service Commission, rather than this Department, should

issue direct instructions to all departments and agencies as to proper

procedures in connection with requests for investigation. I would

accordingly recommend that you work out a plan with the Civil Service

Commission tọ so advise the interested departments and agencies.

5.. As you point out, the last sentence of section 9(k)

of the sample security regulations is subject to possible interpre-

tation requiring the employee to be given a copy of the investigative

reporis in connection with his case.

In order to preclude this

•, possibility, an appropriate amendment has been transmitted to

.jlall.departments and.agencies...Many.of them. have.also-been.

informally advised of the matter.

In addition, since they are

supposed to submit their regulations to this Department before

issuance, proper precautions will be taken at thai time.

w"6. lagree that your existing policy of sending all Bureau

reports to the Commission for dissemination to the appropriate depart-

ments and agencies should be continued:

You note that the sample security regulations do not

state whether the hearings are to be open or closed and that under

Executive Order 9835 the Loyalty Review Board issued a directive to

all departments and agencies requiring hearings under that order to

be private. In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to

thät effect.has been.transmitted to all executive departments and

agencies.

1043

You point out that the sample security regulations

provide in section 9(c)(4) that each employee shall have the right

"to cross-examine any witness offered in support of the charges!

whereas under Executive Crder 9835 the Loyalty Review Loard issued

-2-

•...

a directive permitting Loyalty Hearing Boards to hear witnesses in

the absence of the employee and his counsel, it the witness so

requested.

I understand the provision of section 9(6)(4) to be

terate halesment to its seaminat th coordingisl

persons giving testimony will not have the choices set forth in

your memorandum. I therefore suggest that you advise prospective

witnesses that their testimony will have to be in the presence of

the employee and his counsel and will be subject to cross-examina-

tion.

9. I consider the Bureau's policy of permitting Special

Agents to testify at the hearings only "where they are in a position

to furnish competent evidence," to be sound and suggest that you

undertake through the Civil Service Commission to advise the agencies

the tense e c

concerned that this policy will be continued.

Serious consideration has been given to your suggestion

that dismissals without prejudice to applicants in cases before the

Regional Loyalty Boards may effect the Civil Service Commission's

register of eligibles.

The Commission has already advised that it

believes that, under the basic Civil Service Act, it can establish

criteria with respect to the register of eligibles similar to those

set out in the order.

The Department has advised the Commission

that the order does not preclude it from so acting under the authority

of the Civil Service Act if it is satsified as io the existence of

such authority.

11. I also go along with your view that it will be

necessary that agencies use. a standard form containing sufficient

identlying data in checling individuals!

names through the Bureau'

tiles and in connection with investrgations conducted under the

Executive Order,

and suggest that you worl out a procedure for

jestablishing such a form with the Civil Service Commission.

12.

With relation io section 5 of the order you state that

the Bureau, on receipt of information of a nature necessitating

investigation by it, intends to foliow the -olicy of immediaiely

initiating the investigation rather than avaiting a request from

the department or agency concerned, but notifying the head of the

department or agency that information ot a nature requiring investi-

gation by the Dureau has been received and an investigation is being

conducted You also mention that unon request the interested agency

will be furnished with the basis for the investigation.. I do not

believe this policy to be in conflict with any provision of the order

and see no reason why you should not fotlow the policy you suggeste

candition:

13. You point out that

section 3(a) of the order requires

"a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation", but that section 4(b) of the sample security regulations

dealing with the same subject matter omits the quoted language.

In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to the regula-

tions along the lines you suggest has been transmitted to all executive

departments and agencies.

14. You note that the abolition of Regional Loyalty

Boards and the Loyalty Review Board will affect procedures pursuant

to Executive Order 10422 relating to United States citizens who

are United Nations employees. As you suggested, amendments to

cover this situation have been promulgated to all executive depart-

ments and agencies.

Your attention is invited to the letter from

Mr. Peter Campbell Brown,

then the ecting Assistant to the

Attorney General, to the honorable seth ". Richardson, then

the Chairman of the Loyalty Review Board, dated way 5, 19498

Therein It. Broun requested NT. Richardson to clarify Reuleu

Board instructions to the various departments and agencies

Investigation will testify before Hearing Boards where chey

are in a

position to furnish comnetent evidence. they will not,

however, participate otherwise in the proceedings or will they

be made available merely to interpret information aspearing in

their investigative reports." This policy will continue io be

the polley of this bureau under Executive Order 10450 and it has

been concurred in by the Department of justice.

The lepartment

has further suggested that the commission so advise the various.

departments and agencies that this policy ill be continuede

These points are being called to your attention in order

that you may furnish

Dear Mr. Hoover:

You will recall that several agencies of the Legislative Branch of

the Government participated in the loyalty progran prescribed in Execu-

tive Order 9835. These same agencies have made requests of the Cormis-

sion that they be vermitted to participate in a similar manner under

the program prescribed in Executive Order 10450. By letter dated June 29,

1553, the DeDucy Attorney Caneral davised the Comission that in these

agencies are oi the view that they con adont procedures mich would nake

it possible for them to carvicinate in the progran by virtue of authority

conferred under the acus under which they operate, it would be entirely

appropriate for

them to participate in the progran on

Toluntary basis.

It was sussested in this letter that the Cormission worn out with your

Bureau the question relating toteinomsement oy the agencies involved.

Bezause of the above opinion I have attached for jour consideration

During a current study of tea jurisdiction by this Bureau, le

questions nave arien: uns the autority to docignate organizations been

taken from the Attornay General and given to the SACE by Executive

Order 11608, or is this nuthority concurrent; and at this time, what are

the responsibilities and euthority of the FEI under Executive Order 10450,

This is in sefezence to your menoranaun dated

March 20, 1973 in which you requested to be advised

regarding the Department's position relating to the

above executive orders.

In the event the subversive Activities Control

Board ceases to function after july 1, 1973, the

designation program as authorind by E. O. 10450, as

amendea, will continue to remain in effect. The

'Board's demise will, however, eliminate it as the

boây which at this time has the exclusive authority

to conduct, upon petition of the Attorney General,

the evidentiary hearings and make the determinations

as to whether an organization should be designated

within the criteria and standaras specifiea by

•E. O. 10450, as amendea by e. 0. 11605.

The question of revising E. O. 10450 to overcome

any deficiency which arises as a result of the demise

of the Boara is currently under study in the Depart-

ment.

There is also legislation pending to afford

Congressional approval to E. 0. 11605. Until such

time as these matters are resolved, it is requested

that the Bureau continue to conduct the investi

gations which it has carriea out under. E. 0. 10450

which is, of course, stiïl in effect.

EXECUTIVE ORDER 10150

Executive Order (EO) 10150 in currently being amcided

by the Department and representatives of this Bureau have mrticipatca

in a task force hearied by Mr. Oran Waierman, Diroctor, I'opartment

Socurity Staff, which is recommending certain changes be made in

ED 10450.

During the course of discussions within the task force, it was

pointed out to Mir. Waterman the Bureau's authority to corduct investigations

in the domestic cubversion fiold has come under considerabls scrutiny.

Thir. Burcau is now conducting investigations of comestie cubercion

on the beris of emisting Ecderni statutes. This Invectigalive pollay may

not adequately meet the necds of an eifoctive security of Corernment

cinployeus program under EO 10150..

The Assistant Attorney Ceneral, Office of Loral Counsel,

prevlously solietted our views

on abolition of the Attorney (encrai's Lift.

In our response captioned "Abolition of the Attorney General's List,"

dated April 11, 1071, our comments included advice that under our

current statutory bogie for domestic subversion investinations may not

adcuately meet the necao of 1o 10450 and the obcorvaton tie rei

has never received succiiic instructions from the Attornay Cencral to •

conduct intelligence-type investigations to identily and determine the

activities of organizations deceribed in Fection 8 (a) (5) ci EJ 10150.

We also requestud to be advised as to the instructions of the Atlorney

Concrol relating to the fBI conducting intelligence-type investigations

under 2010150, as well as the scope and parameters within which such

investigations should be.conducted.

Our current practice of concucting subversive-type.

Invesdigations based on rederal stalutes may tend to restrict our

intoligonce gathering concerning organientions, associations, incyemente,

so of come form ci Lepartmental inatruction or order

establishing firm guldellnes for intolligence-type investigntions

wiich would define our authority in this rcgard. It is believed this

would put the felon a dim curdation to corduct intellirenes-type

support BO 10450. We have prevlously recommended that the l'enrtment

scek s comprehensive Executive Order, and furnished suggeated incruage,

which would provide a firm basis for FBI Intelligence-type investigationg

in the gecurity fiold. This recommendation is still under study by the

Executive Order 10450

DATE: NOV ,I 1974

•"':

This is in response to your memoranda, entitled as above,

dated May 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy

Attorney General, Criminal Division, and referring to pro-

blems which have

arisen as a result of the promulgation of

Executive Order I1785 which amends Executive Order 10450.

In

view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I will

undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the

Criminal Division.

As you know this matter has been under continuing'review

both in the Task Fosce, chaired by a representative of this

office, of working level representatives of various agencies

• in the security field and is now under study to a lesser degree

in Project #10 of the "Domestic Council on Privacy",

You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instruc-

itions to the bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations

to identity and determine the activities of organizations now

described in the amended Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order

10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in ini-

tiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter

pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to

be utilized in determining whether available information is a

sufficient basis for investigation.

Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order

10450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those

which unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts:

of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their

rights under the constitution or laws of the nited states or.

3243

## Page 57

any State, (2) or which seek to overthrow the Government of

the United States, or any State os subdivision thereof, by

unlawful means. (Emphasis added).

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate

that the investigation should be initially based on a possible

violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute

prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful

act of force. or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to

detect organizations with a potential' of the above nature, it

is important that the investigation proceed on the basis of in-

formation indicating that the organization may be of the nature

mentioned. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the

investigation is initiated, but only that a reasonable evaluation

of the available information suggests that the activities of the

organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The

most recent example of the type of organization, that you have

advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated

to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) • Organizations of

this nature would clearly fall within the Order and should be

investigated as soon as information is available indicating their

potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to

the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior

communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations

and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the

investigations of such organizations if their programs call for

acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the com-

mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these

programs.

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the

initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling

within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that

offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in

nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi-

gation suggests a determination that the organization is engaged

in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should

continue.

It follows in answer to your second question that indivia-

The

mining whether the investigation should continue, should apply

concerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably

be made that the individuals activities, either within the

Your menorandun of November 1, 1974, in part,

which anked for guidolines to be usod by the fBI in

1n1tiating

investigations of applicants aud employees 11

the Exccutive Branch of the Governuent pursuant to section

8(d) Of EO 10450. This Section specifically instructs

other agencies to promptly refer to the ICE for investi

gation those cases which dovelop information indicating

that an individual may have been subjecied to coercion,

Influence or prossure to act contrary to the intorests of

the national socurity, or inforuation relating to any of

the other matters described therein..

Since the guidelines furnished byyou are

concerned pricarily with possible violation of law, &

docision to be mde by the Department, lt will be

appreciated 11 you will furneh additional guidelines

to cover "sympathetic association" and other standards

mentioned

in Section 3(a) (3) through (S) when the

Investigation concorns an applicant or employee in the

Executive Branch of the Goverzment.

In considering the foregoing, it should be noted

the FBI has another rosponsibility under to 10450 which ig

'set forth in Section 5.

This Section provides that

whenever there is developed or received by any dapartment

or agency intormation indicating that the retontion in

employnent of any officer or employee of the Goverment

may not be clearly consistent with the intorests.of the

national security, such infornation shall be forvarded to

the head of the

enploying deparinent or agency of his

representative.

Your attention is also juvited to Chapter 736.o1

the Federal Personnel Manual, which instructs agencies to

prompily refer to the FBI for investigation cases 'which

develop information indicating that a percon my have been

subject to coorcion, influence or pressuro to act contrary

to the interests ot

Scotion I of tO 10450 requests the

Available information indicates that difficulties

..

An early response in this natter will be

appreciated.

NOTE:

We have corresponded with the Department concerning

amendments to EO 10450 by EO 117S5 and requested guidelines

as to our investigations of subversive matiers defined in

EO I0450 as amended by FO 11785 as none have been previously

furnished by the Department. This is necessary because the

Federal Imployee Security Program depends on subversive

information originating with.our subversive investigations.

The foregoing requests clarification in conflicting language

in the Departnent's response as to subversive investigations

and response to questions concerning the FBI's investigative

role in the above Program.

Although our original inquiry vas directed to

Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the Department

memorandun notes Assistant

We are, therefore, directing our request for clarification to

Section 8 lists the conditions for developing infor

mation which is of investigative and, by inference, adjudicative

interest.

Section 11 states:

"The Attorney General ig requested

to render to the heads of departments and agencies such advice

as may be requisite to enable them to establish and maintain

an appropriate employee security progran."

Chapter 73ª of the Federal Personnel Manual Instructs

that before an agency lasues a letter of charges under BO 10450,

the Department of justice shall be consulted to assure that the

rights of the employees are fully considered.

The Governent Printing Office, General Accounting

Office, and Library of Congress, all in the Legislative

Branch, voluntarily participated in the loyalty program

prescribed by EO 9835.. The same agencies desiren to participate

in the program set up by tO 10450. These agencies again,

with the approval of the Department of Justice, worked out

Commission

procedures for their participation in EO 10450. The results

Of FBI investigations under BO. 10450 concerning applicante

and employees of these agencies in the Legislative Branch are

furnished to the Civil Service Commission, which in turn

furnishes the results to the designated officials in the

specific agency.

Available information indicates that aifficulties.

of proof imposed by the courts in loyalty and security

cases are considered almost insurnountable and as a result

no removal

or other adverse actions have been taken on

these grounds for several years and the adjudicative

basis has shifted from loyalty and security to suitability.

Thus, favorable determinations are said to be based on

GO 10450 while unfavorable decisions almost always rely on

the suitability provisions of Civil Service Regulations.

Volume II, which contains instructions to be followed for

investigations carried out pursuant to no 10450, as amended.

This should be referred to for an understanding

of the FBI's

policy and procedures.

Section 8(ä) reads as follows:

There shall be referred promptly to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation all investigations

being conducted by any other agencies which

develop information indicating that an indivi-

qual may have been subjected to coercion,

influence, or pressure

to act contrary to

the interests of the national security. or

information relating to any of the matters

described in subdivisions (2) through (8)

of subsection (a) of this section..

In савей

so referred to it, the Federal Bureau of

Investigation shall make a full field investigation.

Chapter 736 of the Federal Personnel Manual

instructs agencies to promptly refer to the fal for

Investigation cases "which develop information indicating

that a person may have been subject to coercion, influence,

or pressure to act contrary to the interests of the national

security, or information on possible disloyalty to the

United States." This Chapter also requires that "information

as to subversive activity on the part of employees in the

Executive Branch...is referred by the employing agency....

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation" so that necessary

investigation li conducted by the FBI.

In a memorandum dated August 19, 1974, (enclosed),

to the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,

with a copy for the Director, Department Security Staff,

Department of Justice, reference vas made to EO 11795 dated

June 4,

as well as in evaluating requests for investigations of

individuals received from other agencies and departments

pursuant to Section 8(a) of EO 10450. Guidelines were

roquested for the use of the FBI in initiating investigations

of individuals pursuant to EO 10450 and specifically criteria

to be utilized in determining whether available information

is sufficient basis for investigation under So 10450.

A response to these inguiries was made by the

Assistant Attorney General for Administration on November 1,

1974, (enclosed), advising that the FBI should continue to

conduct investigations to identify organizatione coning

within the purview of Section B(a) (5) of sO 10450, i.e..

organizations which: (1) unlawfully advocate or practice

the comnission of acts of force or violence to prevent

others from exercising their rights under the Constitution

or laws of the United States of any State, or (2) which seek

to overthrow the Government of the United

States or any

State or subdivision thereof by unlawful means.

The Depart

ment advised that if the investigation of an organization

"suggests a determination that the organization is engaged

in illegal activities or potentially illegal activitles. it

should continue.

Regarding the investigation of indiviauals, the

Department advised that members or affiliates of organizations

described above should be investigated and the sane yardstick

should be utilized as was indicated for organizations in

determining whether the Investigation should continue. The

Department added, however, that "when a determination can

reasonably be made that the individual's activities, elther

within the oxganization or as an Individual,

sepcar t

be In violation of any law.

then the Investigation should cease."

In a memorandum dated Decenber 11, 1974, (enclosed) •

to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration, clarifi

cation was requested of the guidelines for investigations by

the FBI of applicants and

employees

In the Executive Branch

under BO 10450 since the Department's atatement that the same

yardstick should be utilised in the case of organizations and

individuals appears to

be at varlance with that used concerning

Order 3464, signed by the Attorney General on January 13,

1953, provides that all files, documents, records and reports

in the Department of Justice shall be regarded as of a

confidential nature.

The Attorney General by memorandum dated December 5,

1947, advised the Bureau that the practice in passing along

to the various government departmente and agencies information

which comes to its attention in connection with the conducting

of investigations, normally and regularly ulthin the Bureau's

jurisdiction,

is entirely appropriate and correct.

The Attorney

General added

that it would appear that the Bureau would be

rentes in its duty if it failed to pass along information

coning to it which might prove in the interest of the general

welfare.

He added that it is not the Bureau's rasponsibility

to determine whether the information is or is not of importance

to the particular agency in the carrying out of its current

activities and responsibility, and whether or not any action

1s taken by the department of

agency is not, of course, a

principal concern of the Bureau.

The Attorney General advised,

therefore, that in his opinion the Bureau should continue

Dear Concerned Citizen:

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me regarding the woric üi the

Select Conmittee on Intelligence Activities. I am sorry to learn that

you are unable to endorse the Conmittee's investigation and the efforts

which have been undertaken to strengthen the Nation's intelligence agen-

cies through closer definitions of their legal authority and areas of •

legitimate operation.

One of the possible abuses under investigation is the violation of the

First and Fourth Amendment rights of Americans under the Constitucion

and Bill of Rights. The American system of govenment is unique in that

it not only permits, but encourages, its citizens to voice their views

on important issues. One of the rights we are. trying to protect is your

right to express your thoughts to me, either over the telephone of through

the mails, without having your message intercepted or recorded uy nauthor-

ized persons. Highly sophisticated equipment now makes it possible to tum

our surveillance techniques, which were originally designed to inlercept

foreign transmissions, inward against ourselves.

It is important that pro-

vision be made for the lawful use of this capability, and that protection

be assured our own. citizens who could become the unwitting victims of this

unconstitutional but nevertheless powerful surveillance technology.

I want to take this opportunity to assure you that the Conmittee's purpose

is not, as sone have suggested, to destroy, degrade, or even castint the

legitimate functions of the intelligence gathering and law entorcement agen-

cies of the United States.

On the contrary, its purpose is to fortity these

valid and vital arcas of operation.

However, we do intend to.Identity abuses

or patterns of abuses which aré clearly unlawful and take action to prevent

their recurrence, whether they involve individuals or nations. •We as indi-

viduals must live within the law; so must our Government and its agencies.

I appreciate your taking the time to write to me, and trust that the

ultimate outcome of this investigation will strengthen the faith of out

people in the integrity of their Govemment.

With all kind wishes.

Reference is made to SSC letter dated February 5,

1976, as modified during a meeting on February 12, 1976,

between John I. silift, SSC Staff Member, and Steven K.

Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination, Department of Justice.

In accordance with the agreement between Messis.

Elliff and Blackhurst, the SSC request of February 5, 1976,

has been limited only to documents pertaining to Attorney

General authorization for electronic surveillance directed

of 1969 "March on Washington."

A review of Bureau files indicated three organiza-

tions were targeted for such coverage. These organizations

were the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam

(NMC) , the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in

Vietnam (SMC) , and the Vietnam Moratorium Cormittee (VMC) •

Attached are unexcised copies of the Attorney

General authorizations, with the exception of the authoriza

tion dated November 7, 1969, for these eleatronic

surveillances.

Page two of the November 7, 1969, communication

contains a deletion pertaining to the identity of targets of

electronic surveillance not concerned with this

subject matter.

This deletion was approved during the

meeting February 12, 1976, mentioned above.

FALL OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM

NOVEMBER 12-16, 1969

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in

Vietnam (NMC) is coordinating efforts for a massive antiwar

manifestation to take place in Washington, D. C.,

November 12-16, 1969•

• This group maintains a Washington, D. C.,

Office at 1029

Vermont Avenue, Northwest, where the planning

takes place.

This demonstration could possibly attract the

largest number of demonstrators ever to assemble in

Washington, D. C.

The large number is cause for major

concern should violence of any type break out. It is

necessary for this Bureau to keep abreast of events as

they occur, and we feel that in this instance advance

knowledge of plans and possible areas of confrontation

would be most advantageous to our coverage and to the

safety of individuals and property. Accordingly, we are

requesting authorization to install a telephone surveillance

on the Washington office of the NIC.

Interception will be made without trespass and

maximum security will be guaranteed. Because of extensive.

contacts of the organization involved, it cannot be'

anticipated whether individuals who are or may be placed

under an active investigation for possible criminal

violations will be overheard by this coverage.

Hon. Frank Church

U.S. Senate

Washington, D.C.

Dear Sen. Church:

621232132

Sy way of background, I served honorably with both the Federal Bureau of Inve

igation and the Central Intelligence Agency for a combined total of over 3:

years. I am proud of my service with each agency and I feel that my activities

were quite worthwhile and in the national interest. I am a graduate of George

washington University Law School and a member of the bar. I am now retired.

As an interested and intellectually curious cktizen, I have been reading

accounts in the public press concerning the activities of the committee which

you happen to chair and of the House Committee which Rep. Otis Pike happens to

both dealing with the U.S. investigative and intelligence programs.Brief-

ly stated, I am totally nauseated by the irresponsible way in which both of you

demand highly sensitive and classified data which seems to be publicized soon

after you get it.

It is my opinion and that of many friends that your committees

are effectively destroying the credibility of these agencies and making impos-

sible their effective performance in the future.

Before going further, let me state that I do not condone irregularities, im-

or illegalities by either agency in their normal, routine activities

out 1 do see the justification, in serious security or Mafia like criminal acti-

vities,for certain "'extracurricular" activities to achieve needed ends and I

think that the Congress should quietly recognize such,with reasonable controls.

You should be proud and complimentary, for instance in my opinion, about the

highly publicized and often misrepresented mail intercept program when you

stop to realize that it was confined to mail to and from Russia and, insofar as

I read, the results were given appropriate safeguards.

I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these

agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to

having appropriate administrative action taken against offending employees and

officials,if their rights are protected. What I do strongly object to is the

pathetically inept and horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inquiries

on sensitive matters are regularly reported, sometimes incompletely and for

apparent political reasons. It just seems to me that someone connected with your

committees is afflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels

them to babble without regard to common sense or the welfare of our intelligence

programs and, as I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.

I am sure that the intelligence organizations of all major nations make some

mistakes.But have you ever seen the British, the French, the

Germans, the Israeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring

on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discredit?

I am sure also that we are the laughing stock of all the above enumerated

nations. What foreign official will entrust sensitive and confidential data to

U.S. intelligence agents in the foreseeable future when he knows that he may soon

see his data publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? I very

sincerely feel that strong administrative and/or criminal action should be taken

In order that there be no misunderstanding, this letter represents nothing!

nore than my very sincere conviction of great personal contempt and disguso witt

he way in which you and your committees have done a

great disservice to th

Inited States by sadly mishandling your responsibilities to these agencies anc

to our nation.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITILS (SSC)

RE: REQUEST FOR MATERIAL, RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

OF "KISSINGER-17"

NOTE:

The above agreement referred to in referenced

Department letter states that material in FBI files

relating to the "Kissinger-17" surveillance would be made

available for review to SSC personnel at FBIHQ. These

personnel may take such notes as deemed appropriate which

notes were to be left in secure location at FBIHQ during

the time the SSC study was in progress. When the study

was completed, the SSC was to prepare a summary of the

information considered appropriate for Committee use.

The

summary would be checked to ensure the protection of

national security matters, protection of confidential

sources of information and observation of privacy consider-

ations,

Thereafter, the approved summary would be

furnished to the Committee and Staff notes destroyed.

Mr. Dick on July 16 and 17, 1975, reviewed the material

relating to the "Kissinger-17"

and left his notes in

possession of Bureau personnel. On 2/17/76, Mr. Dick

requested permission to return to FBIHQ to review the

above notes and prepare his summary which he did on

2/18/76. The summary prepared by Mr. Dick can be placed

into two categories: (a) Political or personal information

obtained from the tesurs which was disseminated to

individuals at the White House and (b) a list of the

targets and the dates the coverage was in operation for

each target comprising the 'Kissinger-17." Review of

this summary indicates that no confidential sources of

this Bureau are jeopardized, and there appears to be no

jeopardy to national security matters.

Regarding the

latter, however, it is felt that the White House would be

in the best position to pass final judgement in this matter.

It is to be noted that the matter of tesur coverage

of some members of the "Kissinger-17" is currently in

litigation.

investigation was not in any way connected with the

dissapcarance of Thonas Riha, a currently missing

Assistant professor of Alstory at the University of

"This statement was nade to interviewees

because the Denver Office has roccived inguiries by

news media concerning liba's disappcarance and they

have been specifically advised there is no evidence

rolating to his disappcoranco showing any violation of

Federal law over which this Burean has jurisdiction.

The circumstances of his disappearance suggest a missing

person situation and that investigation is being bandled

by tho Boulder Police Department.

"Becauso of the close personal relationship

betwech Tannenbaum and Riha, it would be possible,

vathout the above sittemont

by interviewing Agents, that

interviewees could gain the impression the FBI is

investigating the disappearance instead of the

impersonation of i Fedcral officci by Tannchbaum.

He was advised by NiHA

what, if anything, TANNENBAUM actually did in connection with his

being admitted: to the United States; as the matter, to his knowledge

was handled:by. a Czechoslovakian Refugee Connittee. in New. York City

;alo

CERVENY went on te state that after he moved to Denver

he did not see TANNENBAUM again until March 13, 1969, when she

called him on the telephone and suggested he come to

at 248 Logan Street, where his uncle was also visiting her.

stated when he arrived at her house, his uncle

seemed depressed

and upset over the fact that he was

having marital difficulties

with HANA, and that the marriage would probably terminate in

divorce.

He stated the purpose of his being invited to

TANNENBAUM's residence appeared to emanate fron a desire of his

uncle to see him, but that nothing of inportance occurred during

the visit.

Following the disappearance of his uncle on March 15,

1969, he stated TANNENBAUM commenced asking him over to her house

on the pretense of checking up on his innigrant status; towever,

it became innediately apparent that the principal purpose of these

ately apparent te

invitations was an attempt on the part of TANNENBAUM to have sexual

relations with him.

He pointed out there were tines when he

entered her residence when she would be partially unclothed, would

attempt to sit on his lap, sit close to him while watching tele-

vision, or would openly suggest that they go to her bedroom for

the purpose of having sexual intercourse. CERVENY stated TANNENBAUM

was physically repulsive to him, and that he would find an innediate

excuse to leave when she commenced making sexual advances to him.

Juring the period when he was visiting the TANNENBAUM

residence, CERVENY advised she suggested that she copt him, and

actually started adoption proceedings through an attorney in

Denver, STEPHEN L. R. MC NICHoLS, UR:; however, he stated he hac

no desire whatsoever to go through with this, and told IANNENBAUM

He stated it was about this time that he began to suspect that

TANNENBAUM had no connection with Military Intelligence or had any

influence over his immigration status.

He stated that in May, 1969, he desired to go to Toronto,

Canada, to attent a wedding of some Czechoslovakian friends, and

he inquired of TANNENBAUll if such would be legal for him to do.

He stated she told him there was nothing for him to worry about;

however, she suggested

he consult with Inmigration authorities

in Denver resarding this trip.

the United States

for Canada, he would not be able to return.

When he informed. TANNENBAUM of this,

told him tirat she had nore

authority thai

the Innigration officials; and advised: hin to go to

•Canada regardless, as she outranked the officials in Denver.

CERVENY then made the trip to Carada without incident, and learned

later: that: he was actually just.fortunate that. he was not required

Ita.produce. citizenship/papers.at. any.tine".1

In addition; CERVENY stated that in May, 1969, he met

a Czechoslovakian girl in Colorado Springs by the name of MICHEL

BDLIKOVA, who was working at the Broadnoor Hotel, and whom he

eventually introduced to TANNENBAUM.

He stated that TANNENB..UM

immediately told the girl of her Military Intelligence and

Immigration connections, and advised her that she could arrange

to get her a passport. to visit relatives in Czechoslovakia.

stated that in October, 1969, BDLIKOVA told him that TANNENBAUM

had recently approached her with a letter written in English

purportedly from THOMAS PIHA to CERVENY. He stated BDLIKOVA was

asked by TANNENBAUM to rewrite the letter in Czechoslovakian, and

that he eventually received this letter

postmarked from somewhere

He felt at the time he received the letter that it had

not been written by his uncle, and when he was advised by BDLIKOVA

He stated that immeidately

after being told of the letter by BDLIKOVA in Ostober, 1969, he

filed a missing persons notice with the Boulder, Colorado Police

Department the following day. He stated the last time he saw

TANNENBAUM was just before or after he made this report to the

Boulder Police Department.

With regard to CERVENY's association with GALYA

TANNENBAUM, he recalled that on several occasions she tud him

that she would like to recruit him into Military Intelligence, as

his engineering background and language ability would be "extremely

useful to us."

She also told him that if he were in the United

States "working for the other side," she would shoot hin.

TANNEN-

BAUM also told CERVENY that she had origirally net THOMAS RIFiA in

Chicago, and that after she came to Colorado, he followed her for the

purpose

of marrying her; however, the marriage did not take place

as RIHA was unable to get along with her children.

He stated that

upon reflection, he feels that his uncle actually believed that

TANNENBAUM was connected in some official capacity with the United

States Government, and that there was sonething in their relation-

ship which he feels gave TANNENBAUM sore type of influence over the

actions of his uncle; however, in conversation with born his uncle

CERVENY also recalled. that in December,: 1968; his

father visited him, and during the visit, showed hin a diamond

bräce let which he had snuggled into: the United States for the

purpose.of:selling:.forarelative.in.Czechoslovakia.He-statedpr.r../.

his father had previously cornesponded with another individual

by the name of RIHA in San Antonio, Texas, who was no relation

to his uncle, but whom his father had known in Czechoslovakia.

According to CERVENY, his father made a trip to San Antonio to

leave this bracelet with the RIHA in San Antonio for him to

attempt to sell; however, the bracelet was eventually returned

to CERVENY from the RIHA in San Antonio, who advised him he could

locate no buyer.

Thereafter, he showed the bracelet to TANNEN-

BAUM, who indicated a desire to buy it. Both went to a jeweler

in the Denver Hilton Hotel, who appriased the bracelet at $350.

TANNENBAUM, however, offered him $500 for the bracelet, and

actually paid him $400 in cash with a promise to pay him an

additional $100 later, which he never received.

CERVENY recalled another incident which furthered

his suspicions of TANNENBAUM in regard to a will which he

witnessed at her insistence. By way of background,

he explained

that in the spring of 1969, TANNENBAUM introduced him to an

elderly man by the name of GUSTAV FREDERICH INGWERSEN, a plastics

engineer and a native of Germany, who owned some type of plasties

plant in Denver, Colorado.

He stated he had formerly done some

work in plastics, and TANNENBAUM suggested that INGWERSEN might

help him get established in this field.

As a result of this

meeting, CERVENY became friendly with INGWERSEN, and in the

company of TANNENBAUM and her two children, made two vacation

trips to New Mexico with him. He stated these trips were in

either April or May, 1969, and in June, 1969, TANNENBAUM advised

ham that INGWERSEN had died. Then on July 5, 1969, TANNENBAUM

had him visit her residence where she told him that INGWERSEN

had drawn up

a will and

signed it prior to his death, but had

neglected to have two witnesses sign it in accordance with

Colorado law.

She said that INGWERSEN liked CERVENY and had

intended to ask him to witness the will, but had died before this

could be accomplished. She then coaxed him for over an hour to

witness this docunent, and still believing she was a bona fide

official in some Governmental capacity, he affixed his signature

to the will.

CERVENY concluded by stating that TANNENBAUM had never

obteined anvthing of value

At this time TANNENBAUM told her that she was a Colonel

in Military Intelligence, and was soon to be promoted to the

rank of General.

She told Mrs. STEIN that she could utilize

some influence in securing an FHA loan for her; that she had the

authority to deport her at any time; and intimated to Mrs. STEIN

that for a percentage of the loan obtained,

she would obtain

same; and if Mrs. STEIN did not agree to this arangement, she would

her deported.

Mrs. STEIN again pointed out

she considered

TANNENBAUM a "nut," and told her that all of immigration and

business dealings

were handled through her attorney.

Mrs. STEIN stated that to the best of her recollection,

the above was the last time she saw TANNENBAUM, and in February,

1969, she made a trip to Columbia, South America, where she had

resided for approximately ten years before coming to the united

and did not again return to Lyons until March 18, 1969,

Stitosing the disappearance of RIllA from Boulder, Colorado, on

March 15: 1969.

stated

that

January 29.g. 1970

STEPTEN FISCHER-GALATI, ProfesSor,

Department. öf

History, University of Colorado, -advised that he had. just retürned

fron a European trip. He recalled first meeting Professor THOMAS

RIHA-sometime in 1966 at a meeting of the American Historical

Society. in San Francisco. He advised he larso had heard of RIHA:

prior to their meeting. He advised that after RIHA came to the

University of Colorado he knew hin as a fellow faculty member of

the Department of History and had dinner with him on two or three

occasions. He advised their relationship was casual and could not

have been considered a profound relationship.

FISCHER-GALATI advised he first me: GALYA TANNINDAUM

sometime in May, 1969, after the disappearance of trofessor RIMA.

He advised his

object

in meeting TANNENBAUM was to determine if she

were a

"colonel" as described in hearsay.

He advised he was con-

vinced she was not connected with any kind of intelligence work

and knew nothing of Eastern European history. He recalled that

TANNENBAUM

stated she had known RIHA for nany years and indicated

she had helped RIHA come to the United States but gave no further

explanation.

He also recalled that TANNENBAUM displayed a

Power

Of Attorney" document which was contained in a letter allegedly

signed by ToM RiHA.

He advised the most

significant part of the

document to hin was the date of sane, which he easily recalled

January 5. 1968.

FISCHER-GALATI pointed out that January Es 1969,

Is the date of the overthron of the Czechoslovakiar Government: at

which time novOloNy was replaced by duelax, and at this sare tire

the official who was in control of passports disappeared and aub

sequently showed up in Montreal, Canada.

He recalled that TARNENBAUN

•indicated she carried a gun in her purse and that her car ha

Scms

special equipment, but TANNENBAUM did not elaborate further.

fe

advised that

TANNENBAUM

was extremely careful in her conversations

with hin and made no allegations.

FISCHER-GALATI advised his second meeting with TANMERBAUM

occured on October 1, 1969, at 2:15 p.m., same obtained fron his

notebook. He recalled that

and

TANNINBAUM called hin on the telephone

arranged to meet him in front of the colorado Book Stone in

Boulder.

He recalled that her car vas parked legally at the

aforementioned location. He recalled that she was anxious to

determine

why a check had "bounced" in RitA's bank account.

recalled she

wanted to know if the Universily was

continuing to

deposit RIHA's salary to his bank account, as all University faculty

are paid, and she also wanted to see the receipt for the deposit

of his salary per University records,: He advised he had determined:

a discrepancy. existed. between. what: the University claimed to.put

into the account and what. they

He advised at this meeting TANNENBAUM did

agtually.put into RIlAls.account-

not discuss RIHA's

•Whereabouts:

He recalled his third meeting with IANNENBAUM occured

about five days later at the same location, although this time

TANNENBAUM was accompanied by a small female child about three

years of age.

He advised her of the amount the University had

deposited to RIHA's accrunt..

At this time TANNENBAUM told him

her real name was not GALY; TANNENBAUM, but something else which

she did not disclose, and added that she was about ready to leave

He advised of

no contact with IANNENBAUM since their last

meeting.

STEPHEN FISCHER-GALATI advised that the date of the

document mentioned above of January 5, 1968, and its historical

significance disturbs him. He stated if RIHA was not "bumped

off" by TANNENBAUM: then he assumes that RIHA's disappearance

nay have been connected with an unknown intelligence matter,

which is pure conjecture on his part.

FISCHER-GALATI also recalled

that in September, 1968, PrOfESSOr RIHA requested that

‚an advertise-

ment for a travel

bureau be run in the

• "Eastern Europeán Quarterly,"

which GALATI described as an international journal to pronote cui-

tural contact with

Eastern European Countries.

He advisea NIhA

did not indicate if the advertisement was run for a friend or if

RIHA had any financial interest in the travel agency named Ireasure

l'ours, 1010 St. Catherine way, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. FISCHER-

GALATI advised that because of the reasons mentioned, he sometines

believes that RIHA could be in Canada.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI advised that in April, 1969:

he contacted a Mir. FRIIZ of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),

Denver, Colorado,

regarding the sudden leaving of Professor THOMAS

RIHA of the University of Colorado.

Mr. FRITZ advised him that he

had no knowledge of the matter but

would check into same. Professon

FISCHER-GA-ATI. stated he was later recontacted by FRITZ, who stated

the disappearance had

nothing

to do

with the CIA and that RikA's

leaving was a personal matter

connected

with personal problems.

""?.

Professor FISCHER-CALATI explained that. in the absence

of a complete denial by Mr: FRIZ that the CIA had

any

dealings

with RIHA at any time, he,

therefore, concluded and was convinced

the information furnished by Mr fRIll did not represent a

personal opinion but must have come rrom within the cia

added that inasnuch as it then appeared to him that RIHA had left

voluntarily, he also concluded he had io reason to fear for the

safety of RIHA.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI said that if he had

been subsequently quoted in the "Colorado Daily" or any other

newspaper as saying that RIHA had left voluntarily and was safe,

such quotation would have been correct.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI continued that he did not

feel, however, that the explanation about RiHA was adequate and

for that reason subsequently directed a letter to the Chief of

the Foreign Agenis Registration section within the justice Depart-

ment, whom he inew well. He thereafter received a reply that the

Chief to whom he directed the letter was deceased.

He stated he thereafter directed a second letter to

the same section mentioned above within the Justice Department in

mid-December, 1969, again inquiring about RIHA, but as yet has

received no reply.

He stated he did not know of anything of value ever

received by TANNENBAUM as a result of any representation.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to memorandum of Steven R.

Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination, to John A. Mintz, Assistant Director, Legal

counsel Division, FBI, dated February 20, 1976, enclosing

SSC letter dated Tebruary 18, 1976.

Referenced letter requests interviews with FBI

Agents of the Chicago Office who prepared memoranda con-

cerning the Black Panther Party.

In view of current civil litigation Involving

members of the Black Panther Party, and Agerts of the FBI,

it 1s felt that it would not be proper to make these Agents

available for interview by the SSC at this time.

The FBI 1s in

agreement with the Department's view

that a proper response would be to allow the ssc to review

transcripts of the Agents' testimony at the trial, conceming

these memoranda.

SUBJECI: SSG Letter Dated February 18, 1976

Attached is a letter from the Senate Selact

Committee dated February 18, 1976, which requests

interviews with IBI agents who wrote various nem-

•oranda concerning the Black Panther Party in Chicago.

Because such interviews might impair the Department's

ability to conduct a defense in the Hampton trial, in

Chicago, I have asked the Department attorneys hand-

ling that case to give us their views on an appropriate

response to Senator Church's letter.

One possible re-

sponse would be to provide the SSC with the transcripts

of the FBI agents testimony at the trial concerning

these memoranda,

instead of allowing the

SSC to inter-

view these agents. We would appreciate it if the FBI

would also consider what response would be appropriate

-to this letter.

It was brought to the attention of the Legal Counsel

Division that in the Senate Select Committee report concerning

COINTELPRO the identities of Agents were contained which are

below the level of Section Chief.

The prior procedure and policy

of the Senate Select Committee was not to include anybody below

a policymaking position which it equated with Section Chief or

above.

F. A. 0. Schwartz, Counsel to captioned Committee, was

contacted concerning this matter and Schwartz stated that he

wanted to assure the Bureau that there would be no names of Agent

personnel included in the report under the title of Section Chief.

He indicated that their procedures and policies concerning utili-

zation of the identity of Agent personnel will be consistent with

the policies established by their Bureau mail opening report.

This

report was written by James Dick of the Committee and contains the

identity of only one Section Chief and that is William A. Branigan.

No one below the rank of Section Chief was identified. In fact,

Dick did not identify SACs involved in this operation.

NOTE:

This is the first instance wherein the SSC has

made available for review a proposed rough draft of a seg-

ment of the upcoming SSC report.

It is expected that other

segments will be made available by the Committee Staff

Members, It was necessary to review this proposed draft

in the offices of the SSC since they do not contemplate

permitting proposed drafts to leave their premises. The

approval for the use of information from the 2 classified

documents has been coordinated with the IS-2 Section of

On February 19, 1976, at the invitation of

Staff Member Robert Rellay of the SSE, Supervisors

Idward P. Grigalus and Homer A. Newmen, Jr:, reviewed

the proposed draft of the Committee'& report as it

pertains to Informants in the domestic security field.

This review was conducted for the purpose of deter-

mining if the report contatned any Information which

would expose our informants of jeopardize any ongoing

Investigations or investigative techniques in the

domestic internal security field as it pertains to

informants. This revlew did not detect any such

Instances.

Two instances were noted, however, where

Information was set forth taken from classified docu-

ments.

(1) In connection with Internal security -

Intelligence program supports, through the use of

informants, a figure of $7,401,000 was used in the

Committee's draft. This figure was taken from material

captioned "Federal Bureau of Investigation Overall

Intelligence Frogram, FY 77 Budget Compared to FY 76

(Dollars in Thousands)," classified "Secret," which

was made available to the SSC by the Department:

Although the document described above cannot be declags1-

fied, the FBI interposes no objection to the upe of the

above figure in the SSC report providing, the, report.

so reflects that this figure not only includes payments

made to domestic internal security informants for ser-

vices and expenses but also includes the cost of

in Vietnam War

•(1.965)

"Informers were used extensively in FBI investigations of

possible Communist links to the antiwar movement. An example is

the FBI's coverage of

various antiwar teach-ins and conferences

sponsored by the Universities Committee on Problems of War and

Peace. A forty-one page report from the Philadelphia office--based

on coverage by thirteen informants and confidential sources--described

in complete detail a "public hearing on Vietnam." A Communist Party

official had "urged all CP members" in the area to attend, and one

of the organizers was

alleged to have been a Communist in the early

1950's. Upon receipt from an informant of a list of the speakers,

the FBI culled its files for data on their backgrounds. One was

described by a source as a Young Socialist Alliance "sympathizer."

Another was

a conscientious objector to military service.

A third

had contributed $5.000 to the National Committee to Abolish the

House Committee on Un-American Activities. A speaker representing

the W.E.B. DuBois Club was identified as a Communist. The FBI

covered the meeting with an informant who reported practically

verbatim the remarks. of all the speakers, including the following:

•The Chairman of the Philadelphia Ethical Society

A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union

A representative of the United Electrical Workers

A spokesman for the Young Americans for Freedom

A member of the staff of the "Catholic Worker"

A minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church

A minister of the Episcopal Church

A representative of the Philadelphia Area Committee to

End the War in Vietnam

répresentative of the Inter-University Committee for

Debate on Foreign Policy

A member of women's Strike for Peace who had traveled to

North Vietnam

A member of Women's International League for Peace and

Freedom who had visited South Vietnam

A chaplin from Rutgers University

A professor of political science from Villanova University

Another member of Young Americans: for Freedom

The former Charge d'Affaires in the South Vietnamese Embassy

This informant's report was so extensive as to be the equivalent of

a tape recording, although the FBI report does not indicate that the

informant was "wired." Another informant reported the remarks of

additional participants.

An official of the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy

A minister of the church of the Brethren

A Unitarian minister

A representative of United World Federalists

A member of Students for a Democratic Society

A member of the Socialist Workers Party

A spokesman

for the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs

copies for possible dissemination by the FBI to other Executive

Branch agencies. Copies were disseminated to military intelligence

DATE IS UECLASSIVED

This Informative memorandum to advise of status

of lepartmental review of FBI files concerning Martin iuther

King, JI., and related matters.

You will recall that, commencing 12/6/75,

personnel of the Civil Rights Division revlewed portions

of our files concerning King and ralated matters. The

last date such review was conducted in 1975 was on 12/19/75.

On 2/9/76, Crintnal Section Chief Robert A. Murphy resumed

review of the king file.

He worked on this for less than

four hours on that day and vas to return the norning of

2/10/76 but had not returned as of the dictation or this

memorandum at 3:00 p.II., 2/10/76.

Murphy had been reviewing the King file to the

exclusion of other files of interest. The King file is

94 sections in size and, as of 2/9/76, only about 25 sections

leved e and, a

had been reviewed. On that date, Murphy told Supervisor

J. I. Aldhizer that, when he resumed the review the next

day, he wanted to start with the portion of the file

conmencing 1/1/68. This would be Section 77, and thus

Murphy would be skipping approximately 50 sections of

little over half of the file.

Murphy has given no indication, and neither has

there been an indication from any other lepartmental source,

as to the true status of the lepartmant's overall review
