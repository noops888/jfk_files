Mr. Paul A. Walker
"Acting ‘Chaiman:

ions Commission

Dear Mr. Walker;

Under date of November 18, 1947,-there appeared in the column of
Mr. Marquis Childs in the Washington Post the following statement attributed
to Mc. Clifford J. Durr of the Federal Communications Commission; "Already
the FBI is furnishing to the commission unsolicited reports on individuals
connected with radio, dnd I can assure you that if you should be told the
kind of things contained in many of these reports you would dismiss the infor-
mation as baseless gssip."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has referred to the Federal
Commmications- Cormission from time to time infoimation which it has received
in the course of its regular investigations wi h appeared pertinent or material
to matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission. It is the policy and
practice of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid any attempts to eval-
vate the simificance of information relating tc matters without its juris-
“diction or the effect of such information upon the contemporary policies and
programs of other agencies. As a result, the Bureau furnishes tothe various
Government departments such information as it receives which appears pertinent
to'the operations of those Government departments. In so far as is practicable,
the Bureau attempts to evaluate the reliability of the source of this infor-

* mabion. without attempting to maké ‘any suggestions as to the use- vhieh should -
“or should not be made of the information itself.

Mr. Childs, in his column quoting Mr. Durr's statement, adds the
following observation upon Mr. Durr's statement: "Note the word 'wnsolicited'.
It indicates that the FBI initiated investigations and sought to influence
FCC decisions by sending reports on certain individuals to the commission.

If this is hapyening, it is something Congress should Imow about."

I desire to advise you that this Bureau has Suda at any time attempted
. in any manner or degree to influence FCC decisions. ne materi

In the light of the statements made by Mr. Durr and since these
statements have not been repudiated by any other members) of the Federal

Communications Conmsssion, I must assume that the material which the Bureau
has been fwmishing to the Cormission is not desired by jthe Cormission. I

. am consequently discontinuing the transmittal of such to the Commission

This is with reference to your memoranda of May id
May 14, 1953, relating to the administration of Executive Order }_
10450. .

1. Your opinion that there should be no abuse of the j
privilege granted’ by section 3(b) of the order in filling sensitive \
positions in emergency cases prior to the completion of full fie!
pre-appointment investigations is well taken. So, also, is¢your

| suggestion that the Civil Service Commission, in respect to sec-
tion 3(a), should utilizé extreme care in permitting less than
the minimum investigation with respect to per diem, intermittent,
temporary, or seasonable employees and aliens employed outside
the United States.

“2. Lagree with ycur assumption that the coverage of 1

‘the order is limited to the Executive Branch of the Government.

However, I do not believe it will be necessary to make specific

provision in the regulations to that effect. Inasmuch as they

are to be issued separately by and in the name of each executive
‘|\pranchdepartinént of agency, it will be’ made clear that they relate

only to the administration of the particular department or agency

concerned. i

not because that order was necessarily applicable to those agencies,
but because they voluntarily adopted zrocedures wimilar to these
{prescribed by the order, Executive Crder 10450 does not prevent
them from adogting a-similar policy in relation to it. The main
question is whether the approp priations of thé FEI are sufficient

were requested by: letter dated June 5

Frangerie’ dér Executive Order No:"10:
‘abroad as existed under Executive Crder No. 9835. The letter stated
that in the absence of any indication of disagreement with this plan, i
it would be assumed that the existing arrangement would remain in i
effect. To date no expressions of disagreement have come from i
either Department, 5

4. In respect to the re-adjudication question arising :
under section 4, I agree that the Bureau should conduct additional
investigations only when their purpose is to develop information
of the type described in section 8{d). However, I believe the
Civil Service Commission, rather than this Department, should

; issue direct instructions to all departments and agencies as to proper
| procedures in connection with requests for investigation. I would
v ‘f accordingly recommend that you work out a plan with the Civil Service sg
A Commission to so advise the interested departments and agencies,
: 5. As you point out, the last sentence of section ‘90
of the sample security regulations is subject to possible interpre-
tation requiring the emyloyee to be given a copy of the investigative
reports in connection with his case. In order to preclude this
>; possibility, an appropriate amendment has teen transmitted to {
; yall departments. and agencies... Many.of them have:also’been .~--! teeta
informally advised of the matter. In addition, since they are
supposed to submit their regulations to this Department before
issuance, proper precautions will be taken at that

ropriate dezart-

Ss
reports to the Commission for di emination to the ai
| ments and’ agencies should be continued.

7. You note that the sample security regulations do not
state whether the hearings are to be ogen or closed and that under
Executive Order 9835 the Loyalty Review Board issued a directive to j
all departments and agencies requiring hearings under that order to
be private. In accordance with your suggestion,. an amendment to 7

, “secordingly: ft
‘pérsons giving eae will not have the choices set forth-in ~~

: | your memorandum. I therefore suggest that you advise prospective
! | witnesses that their testimony will have to be in the presence of

; | the employee and his counsel and will be subject to cross-examina-
2, | tion.

i : q a 9. Iconsider the Bureau's policy of permitting Special
Agents to testify at the hearings only ''where they are in a position
to furnish competent evidence," to be sound and suggest that you
undertake through the Civil Service Commission to advise the agencies
: concerned that this policy will be continued,

10. Serious consideration has been given to your suggestion
that dismissals without prejudice to applicants in cases before the
Regional Loyalty Boards may effect the Civil Service Commission's
register of eligibles. The Commission has already advised that it
believes that, under the basic Civil Service Act, it can establish
criteria with respect to the register of eligibles similar to those

7 set out in the order. The Department has advised the Commission

a that the order does not preclude it from so acting under the authority

the Bureau, on receipt of information of a nature necessitating
investigation by it, intends to foliow the zolicy of immediately

i "a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation", but that section 4(b) of the sample security regulations

: dealing with the same subject matter omits the quoted language.

In accordance with your suggestion, an amendment to the regula-

of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their



any State, (2) ox which seek to overthrow the dovernment of
the United States, or any State or subdivision jthereof, by
unlawful means. (Emphasis added). : 7 :

O£ course, the key words which are underlined indicate
that the investigation should be initially based on a possible
violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute
prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful
act of force.or violence. However, in order for the Bureau ‘Lo
detect organizations with a potential’ of. the above-nature, it
is important that the investigation proceed on the basis of in-
formation indicating that the organization may be of the nature
mentioned. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the
investigation is initiated, but only that a reasonable evaluation
of the available information suggests that the activities of the
organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The
most recent example of the type of organization, that you have
advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated
to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Organizations of
this nature would clearly fall within the Order and should be
investigated as soon as information is available indicating their
potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to
the fulfillment of their purposes. :

Poors. It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior
communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations
ana definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the
investigations of such organizations if their programs call for
acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the com~

‘ mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these
" programs. : aoe oe

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the
-initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling
within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that
offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in
nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi-
gation suggests a determination that the organization is engaged
in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should
*“ eontinue. : :

It follows in answer to your sdcond question that individ-
vals'who are active either as members of or as affiliates of

.

organizations described above should be investigated when
information is received indicating their involvement. The
same yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-

mining whether the investigation should concent should apply

- concerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably
i be made that the individuals activities, either within the

‘ erganization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio-

lation of any law, then the investigation should ceasé.

7 Your memorandum of November 1, 1574, in part,
responded to this Burcau's memorandum of August 19, 1974,
which anked for guidelines to bo used by the FBI in
initinting investigations of applicants and employees in
the Exccutive Branch of the Governucnt pursuant to Ecctioen
8(d) of £0 16450. This Section snecifically instructs
other agencies to promptly refer to the #22 for investi~
gation thoss cases which develop information indicating
that an individual may have been subjeeted to coercion,
influence or prossure to act contrary to the interests of
the national sccurity, or information relating to any of
the other matters described therein. :

Since the guidelines furnished by you are
concerned primarily with possible violation of law, a
‘decision to be made by the Department, it will be
appreciated if you will furnish additional suidelines
to corer’ “sympathetic ‘nesociation" and other standards
‘mentioned in geetion S{2) (2) through (8) when the
investigation concerns an applicant or employee in the
Executive Branch of the Government.

“In considering the foregoing, it should be noted
the FRI bas another responsibility under “oO 10450 which is
, Bet forth in Section 5. This Section provides that
. Whenever there is developed or received by any department
‘ or agency information indicating that the retontion in

employment of any officer or employee of the Government
may not be clearly consistent with the intorests.of the
national security, such information shail be forwarded to
the head of the employing department or agency or his
representative.

Your attention is also invited to Chapter 736. of
the Federal Personnes] Hanual, which instructs agencics to
promptly refer to the FBI for investigation cases "which

develop information indicating that a person may have been
subject to coercion, influence or pressure te act contrary
to the interests of the national security, or informaticn on
possible disloyalty to the United States."

NOTE: ere 7

We have corresvonded with the Department concerning

_ amendments to EO 10450 by EO 11785 and requested guidelines
as to our investigations of subversive matters defined in

EO 10450 as amended by EO 11785 as none have been previously
furnished by the Department. This is necessary because the
Federal Eaployee Security Program depends on subversive
information originating with our subversive investigations.
The foregoing requests clarification in conflicting language
in the Department's response as to subversive investigations

‘ and response to questions concerning the FBI's aiaimeahcaisiescanie

role in the above Program.

Although our original inquiry was directed to
Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, the Department
memorandum notes Assistant Attorney General, Administrative
Division, answered with concurrence of the Criminal Division.
We are, therefore, directing our request for clarification to
casitanatcaaa Attorney General for Administration. 7

Section 8 lists the conditions for developing infor-
mation which is of investigative and, by inference, adjudicative

‘ interest.

Section 13 states: “The Attorney General is requested
to render to the heads of departments and agencies such advice
as may be requisite to enable them to establish and maintain
an appropriate employee security program."

7 Chapter 732 of the Federal Personnel Manual instructs
that before an agency issues 4 letter of charges under BO 10450, -
the Department of Justice shall be consulted to assure that the
rights. of the employees are fully considered. : :

The Government Printing Office, General Accounting
Office, and Library of Congress, all in the Legislative ;
Branch, voluntarily participated in the loyalty program
prescribed by £O 9835.. The same agencies desired to participate
in the program set up by FO 10450. These agencies, again,
with the approval of the Department of Justice, worked out

with the Department and with the Civil Service Commission;

procedures for their participation in EO 10450. The results
of FBI investigations under EO. 10450 concerning. applicants .-
and employees of these agencies in the Legislative Branch are
furnished to the Civil Service Commission, which in turn
furnishes the results to the designated officials in the .
specific agency. 7

available information indicates that difficulties
of proof imposed by the courts in loyalty and security
cases are considered almost insurmountable and as a result
no removal orother adverse actions have been taken on.
these grounds for several years and the! adjudicative
basis has shifted from leyalty and security to suitability.

‘phus, favorable determinations are said to be based on

BO 10450 while unfavorable decisions almost always rely on

“the suitability provisions of Civil Service Regulations.

investigation cases "which develop information indicating
that a person may have been subject to coercion, influence,

as well as in evaluating requests for investigations of
individuals received from other agencies and departments
pursuant to Section 8(d) of EO 10450, “Guidelines were
requested for the use of the FBI in initiating investigations
of individuals pursuant to EO 10450 and specifically criteria
to be utilized in determining whether available information
is sufficient basis for investigation under EO 10450.

A xvesponse to these inquiries was made by the
Assistant Attorney Gerieral for Administration on November 1,
1974, (enclosed), advising that the FBI should continue to
conduct investigations to identify organizations’ coming
within the purview of Section 6(a) (5) of EO 10450, i.e.,
organizations which: (l)unlawfully advocate or practice
the commission of acts of force or violence to prevent
others from exercising their rights under the Constitution
or laws of the United States or any State; or (2})which seek
to overthrow the Government of the United States or any
State ox subdivision thereof by unlawful means. The Depart~
ment advised that if the investigation of an organization
eases a determination that the organization is engaged

in illegal activities or potentially fiiegal activities. it
should continue. :

Regarding the investigation of individuals, the
Department advised that members or affiliates of organizations
described above should be investigated and the same yardstick
should be utilized as was indicated for organizations in
detexmining whether the investigation should continue. The

. Department added, however, that “when a determination can

reasonably be made that the individual's activities, efther
within the organization or as an individua: ; iO not appear to
be in violation of any law, then the investigation should cease.”

In a memorandum dated Deéembez ll, 1974, fenalosed) ,

_ to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration, clarifi-

cation was requested of the guidelines for investigations “by
the PBI of applicants and employees in the Executive Branch
under EO 10450 since the Department's statement that the same
yardstick should be utilized in the case of organizations and
individuals appears to be at variance with that used concerning
organizations. 7

Supplement Number 4 (zevised) of Departmental
Order 3464, signed by the Attorney General on January 13,
1953, provides that all files, documents, records and reports
in the Department of Justice shall be regarded as of a-
confidential nature. : :

The Attorney General by memorandum dated December 5,
1947, advised the Bureau that the practice in passing along
to the various government departments and agencias information
which comes to its attention in connection with the conducting
of investigations, normally and regularly within the Bureau's
jurisdiction, is entirely appropriate and correct. The Attorney
General added that it would appear that the Bureau would be
remiss in its duty if it failed to pass along information
coming to it which might prove in the interest of the general
welfare, He added that it is not the Bureau's responsibility
to determine whether the information is or is not of importance
to the partioular agency in the carrying out of its current
activities and responsibility, and whether or not any action
is taken by the department or agency is not, of course, a
principal concern of the Bureau. The Attorney General advised,
therefore, that in hie opinion the Bureau should continue to
pasa along information, which it is believed might be of ©
‘intexest to the various departments and agencies.

It shoulda be noted that our FBI reports distributed
to outside agencies are stamped as the property of the FBI with
this additional notation," This document contains neither
recommendations nor. conclusions of the PBI and ie leaned to your

The memorandum pointed out that, as in the past,
these reports are furnished te the Department in order that
consideration may be given as to whether any Federal laws
have been violated and for information concerning possible
subversive infiltration into the Executive Branch of the
Government.

With regard to a determination as to whether any
Federal laws have been violated, it was noted the violations
generally involve Title 18, U.S, Code 1001, and a response is
received from the Criminal Division.

Information concerning subversive infiltration
into the Executive Branch igs furnished for the Department's
assistance in discharging its responsibilities under
Section 13 of EO 10450,

The Assistant Attorney General for Administration,

the practice as outlined in the memorandum of August 14, 1974,
satisfies the needs of the Department. : :

As the result of reorganization in the Department,
these reports are now sent to the Director, Security and

CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE FBI WILL CONDUCT ITS

With regard to Sectiens 5 and 6(d), supra, the FBI
sent a memorandum dated May 1, 1953, (enclosed), to the :
Deputy Attoxney General pointing cut that the FEI contemplated
following the policy in existence under EO 9835 (Federal
Employee Loyalty Program) of initiating an investigation based
on available information rather than awaiting a request for
auch an investigation under EO 10450 from the interested
department or agency. It was stated that if this practice
was in conflict with the provisions of BO 10450, consideration
could be given to clarification. in subsequent regulations.



SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

In reply the Deputy Attorney General on June 25,
1953, (enelosed), advised he did not believe the policy
cutlined in the memorandum dated May 1, 1953, to be in
conflict with any provision of £0 10450 and saw no reason
why the FBI should not continue this policy.

@he FBI has continued the practice approved in
the Department's memorandum of June 25, 1953, and by memorandum
dated January 23, 1976, to the Deputy Attorney General, the
Department was advised that this policy still continves

preparation of in-depth position papers for an Executive Con-
ference which led to the above-mentioned paper by Thomas J. Smith.
Thereafter Section 87 was revamped and security investigations
were to be based on Federal statutes.

As indicated above, extensive file reviews were con-
ducted to locate various communications referred to in documents
being provided SSC and these efforts were negative. Additionally,
some documents being provided SSC contain information of interest
regarding the manual change; however, enclosures and attached
letters with these documents did not pertain to the manual change
and therefore these items were not furnished SSC.

Dear Concemed Citizen:

Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me regarding the work of
Select Conmittee on Intelligence Activities. I am sorry to
you are‘unable to endorse the Committee's investigation aad
which have been undertaken to strengthen the Nation's intelli, gence agen-
cies through closer definitions of their legal authority ad areas of -
legitimate operation.

One of the possible abuses wider investigation is the violation of the
First. and Fourth Amendient rights of Americans under the Constiturion
and Bill of Rights. Thé American system of govensnent is unique in that
it not only pemnits, but encourages, its citizens to voice their views
oa importemt issues. One of the rights we are, trying to protect is vour

right to express your thoughts to me, either ‘over | a telep! or through
the mails, without having your message intercepted x ecorded by unauthor-

ized persons. Highly sophisticated equipment new makes it possible to tum
our sutveillance techniques, wiich were originally. designed to intercept
foreign transmissions, inward against ourselves. It is important that*pro-
vision be made for the lawful use of this capability, and that protect
be assured our own. citizens who’ could becom the unwitting victims of this
unconstitutional but nevertheless powerful surveillance technology.

IT want to take inis opportunity to assure. you that ‘the Conmi.tvce" s purpose
is not, as some have suggested, to- ‘degtroy, ‘degrade, or even disrupt the

legitinate functions of the. intelligence gathering and law enforcem:
cies of the United States. On’ the contrary, “its purpose is to y
valid and Mae axeas of operation. ‘However, we do intend to-identify
ox patterns of cbuses which are. clearly unlawful and take action to prevent
their recurrence, whether they involve individuals or nations. «We as indi-
viduals must Live within the law; so must our Government and its agencies.

Bich

I appreciate your taking the time to write to me, and trust that the
ultimate outcome of this investigation will strengthen the faith of our
people in the integrity of their Government.

With all tcind wishes. ; f?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL .
RE: FALL OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE WAR IN VIETNAM
NOVEMBER 12-16, 1989
INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

The New Mobilization Committee to End the War in
Vietnam (NHC) is sponsoring a massive antiwar manifestation
to take place in Washington, D. C., on November 12-16, 1969.
The Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam
(SMC) and the Vietnam Moratorium Committee (VMC) are closely
coordinating their efforts with NMC in organizing the
demonstration, NC, SMC and VMC occupy adjoining office
space at 1029 Vermont Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C.

SMC is completely dominated and controlled by the

Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party: (SWP) and its youth affiliate,

the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA). The VMC has recently
endorsed fully the activities of NMC concerning the upcoming
antiwar demonstration, 7

This demonstration could possibly attract the
largest number of demonstrators ever to assemble in
Washington, D. C., which is cause for major concern should
violence of any type break out. It is necessary for this
Bureau to keep abreast of events as they occur, and we feel
advance knowledge of plans and possible areas of confrontation
during the demohstration would be most advantageous to our
coverage and to the safety of individuals and property.

We have separately requested authorization to install
a telephone surveillance on the office of NMC. To further
implement our coverage, we are requesting authorization to
install telephone surveillances on the offices of SMC and VMC,

Hon. Frank Church

U.S. Senate _
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sen. Church:

By way of background, I served honorably with both the Federal Buresy of Inv
igation_and the Central Intelligence Agency for a combined total of ove 33
years. I am proud of my service with each agency and I feel that my activities
were quite worthwhile and in the national interest. I sm a graduate of George
Washington University Law School and a member of the bar. I am now retiréd.

As an interested and intellectually curious .cktizen, I have been reading
accounts in the public press concerning the activities of the committee which
you happen to chair and of the House Committee which Rep. Otis Pike happens to
chair, both dealing with the U.S. investigative and intelligence programs.Brief-
ly stated, I am totally nauseated by the irresponsible way in which both of you
demand highly sensitive snd clessified data which seems to be publicized soon
after you get it. It is my opinion and that of many ffiends that your committe
are effectively destroying the credibility of these sgencies and making impos-
sible their effective performance in the future.

Before going further, let me state that I do not condone irregularities, im-

"* proprieties or illegalities by either agency in their normel,routine activitie
but I do see the justification,in serious security or Mafia like criminal acti-
vities,for certain "extracurricular" activities to achieve needed ends and I
think that the Congress should quietly recognize such,with reasonable controls,
You should be proud and complimentery,for instance in my opinion,sbout the
highly publicized and often misrepresented mail intercept program when you
stop to realize that it wes confined to mail to and from Russia and,insofer as
I read, the results were given appropriate safeguards,

I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these
agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to
having appropriate administrative action taken against offending employees and
officials,if their rights are protected. What I do strongly object to is the
pathetically inept and horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inquiries
on sensitive matters are regularly reported,sometimes incompletely and for

~ apparent political reasons, It just seems to me that someone connected with your
committees is afflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels
them to babble without regard to common sense or the welfare of our intelligence
progrems and, as I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.

I am sure that the intelligence organizations of all major nations make some
mistakes.But have you ever seen the British,the French,the Russians,the
Germans,the Israeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring
circus" on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discredit?
I am sure also thet we are the laughing stock of all the above enumerated
nations. What foreign official will entrust sensitive und confidential data to
U.S. intelligence agents in the foreseeable future when he knows that he may soo.
see his date publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? I very
sincerely feel that strong administrative and/or criminal action should be taken

» in any cases where either or both of your committees and/or their person:
been the vehicle for embarrassing or damaging the U.S. by action
in confidential data being reported.

In order that there be no misunderstanding,this letter represents ae
more then my very sincere conviction of great personal contem| ith
the way in which you and your committees have done a great disservice to the
United States by sadly mishandling your responsibilities to these agencies and
to our nation.

Sincerely,

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (ssc)

RE: REQUEST FOR MATERIAL RELATING TO ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE
OF "KISSINGER-17"

NOTE:

The above agreement referred to in referenced
Department letter states that material in FBI files
relating to the "Kissinger-17" surveillance would be made
available for review to SSC personnel at FBIHQ. These
personnel may take such notes as deemed appropriate which
notes were to be left in secure location at FBIHQ during
the time the SSC study was in progress, When the study
was completed, the SSC was to prepare a summary of the
information considered appropriate for Committee use, The
summary would be checked to ensure the protection of
national security matters, protection of confidential
sources of information and observation of privacy consider-
ations, Thereafter, the approved summary would be
furnished to the Committee and Staff notes destroyed.

Mr. Dick on July 16 and 17, 1975, reviewed the material
relating to the 'Kissinger-17" and left his notes in
possession of Bureau personnel, On 2/17/76, Mr. Dick
requested permission to return to FBIHQ to review the
above notes and prepare his summary which he did on
2/18/76. The summary prepared by Mr. Dick can be placed
into two categories: (a) Political or personal information
obtained from the tesurs which was disseminated to
individuals at the White House and (b) a list of the
targets and the dates the coverage was in operation for
each target comprising the "Kissinger-17,"" Review of

this summary indicates that no confidential sources of
this Bureau are jeopardized, and there appears to be no
jeopardy to national security matters, Regarding the
latter, however, it is felt that the White House would be
in the best position to pass final judgement in this matter.

It is to be noted that the matter of tesur coverage
of some members of the "Kissinger-17" is currently in
Litigation.

ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Le lestion: Does the FBI know the whereabouts of
Riha-~whether he is alive or dead? Where?

Answer: ‘The FBI does not know the whereabouts
of Riha or Whether he is alive or dead.

2. Question: Was Riha known to the Agency? If
so, when £irst known and why?

Answer: A11 information relating to the FBI's
knowledge of Rika has been previously furnished to the
SSC. The first communication pertaining to Riha was a
memorandum from CIA dated October 27, 1958. This
memorandum was furnished the SSC on June 13, 1975.

3. Question: Was Riha employed by FBI? If so,
in what capacity? Pates of omployment?

Answer: Riha was not employed by the FBI.

4. Question: In March or April 1°69 or thereafter,
did Mrs. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum of Denver and Boulder,
Colorado, contact the FBI in Colorado or Washington to
assure the FBI that missing University of Colorado
Professor Thomas Riha was alive and woll and had left his
home for personal reasons on March 15, 1969? Ef so, who
in the FBI received this information and to whom was this
anformation passed on in the FBI and the CIA? When was
this done?

Answer: Mrs. Gloria (Galya) Tannenbaum did
not contact the FBI in March or April, 1969, for any
reason. On May 14, 1969, she was contacted by Special
Agents of the FBI at her residence in Denver, Colorado, in
connection with an investigation involving charges that

U. 8. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 10

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC)

she had impersonated an officer of the U. S. Immigration
and Naturaiization Service. There is no record that
Riha was discussed during this contact. A letter from
the Denver Office of the FBI dated February 12, 1970,
reported that on January 28, 1970, she was interviewed
by Special Agents of the FBI at Boulder City Jail, Boulder,
Colorado, at which time sho offered the opinion that Riha
had decided to leave Doulder due to marital difficulties
and personal clashes with other members of the faculty at
the University of Colorado. She listed a number of
telephonic and personal contacts she had had with him
subsequent to March, 1269,

the communication reporting the May 14, 1669,
contact docs not list the names of the Special Agents who
contacted her, however, the communication was prepared by
Special Agent Merrill R. Smith. At that time Special Agent
Snith and Special Agent J, Hale McMenamin were the only
Ageuts assigned at Boulder, Colorado. As the SSC was
previously advised on November 21, 1975, the January 22,
1970, communication from Denver FBI to FBIHQ could not be
located and therefore it cannot be determined who at FBIHQ
received it or if the information was passed to CIA.

Tho letter fvom the Donver Office to FBIM on
Fobruary 12, 1970, was initialed by a case supervisor in
the General Investigative Division and a case supervisor
in the Intelligence Division. Other than the information
following in response to question number 5, there is no
indication that the information was passed to CIA.

5. Question: Was this or other information passed
on by the FBI to the CIA or to other agencies and the
Denver and Boulder police? what was the information
conveyed? When was this done?

7 NW 55015 DocId:32989603 Page 148



U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Answer: The report of the interview of
Tannenbaum Gn January 28, 1970, was included in a
memorandum which was furnished to FBIHQ by communication
from Denver dated February 12, 1970, captioned
‘"Galya Tanenbaum, aka, Impersonation.” The memorandum
was disseminated at FBIHQ to CIA, Secret Service, State
Department, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and
Defense Intelligence Agency. ‘The memorandum was
furnished to the BU, S&S. Attorney, Denver, Colorado, by
the Denver FBI Office. There is no indication that the
information was passed to the Denver or Boulder police.

6. Question: Why did FBI say in 1969 and 1970--
and continues to say now--that it conducted no
investigation of Riha'ts disappearance when it is known
that FBI agents taiked in 1969 and 1970 with friends of
Riha about hia disappearance?

Answer: The FBI said in 2969 and 1970 and
continues ta say now that it conducted no investigation
of Riha's disappearance because from the outset of his
disappearance to now, the FBI has never conducted any
investigation into the disappearance of Thomas Riha.
Reference is made to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth
paragraphs of Denver FBI letter to the Director dated
February 12, 1970, supra, previously furnished to the
SSC on November 21, 1975, which read as follows: “A111
persons interviewed in this investigation were specifically
advised by interviewing Agents that the purpose of this
investigation was to ascertain whether Galya Tannenbaum
had in any way violated Federal statutes concerning
impersonation. Interviewees were specifically advised

7 NW 55015 DocId:32989603 Page 149

ACTIVITIES (SSC}

investigation was not in any way cannectcd with the
dissapearance of Thomas Riha, a currently missing
Assistant Professor of History at the University of
Colorado, Boulder, Colorado.

"this statement was made to interviewees
beeause the Denver Office has rcccived inquiries by
news media concerning Riha's disappcarance and they
have beon specifically advised there in no cvidence
relating to his disappcaranca showing any violation of
Federal law over which this Bureav has jurisdiction.

The circumstances of his disappoarance suggest a missing
person situation and that investigation is being handled
by the Boulder Police Department.

“Because of the close personal relationship
hbotween Tannenbaum and Riha, it would be nossible,
without the above statcnent by interviewing Agents, that
interviewees could gain the impression the FBI is
investigating the disappearance instead of the
impersonation of a Federal officer by Tanncibaun.

“puxsuant to curront Bureau iustructions, this
office is not and has not conducted any investigation

did an Fis zt x office refuse to accompany
CIA Agent trom Boulder to sce then
Tenver DIT F MeKevittyY Was it made known

by the CIA agent that the purpose of the visit was to casa
the pressure on issuance of 2 subpoena to Dr. Joseph Smiley,

such a subpoena, Eniloy might have been reduired to reveal
the agency that had siven him the April L°Om report that
Riba was alive and weli at that time.)

ACTIVITIES (SSC)

NOTE:

Zdenek Cerveny and Francesca Stein were
interviewed at Lyons, Colorado, 1/21/70, by Special
Agents Merrill R. Smith and J. Hale McMenamin.
Joyce Lebra was interviewed by the same Agents on
1/21/70 at Boulder, Colorado.

Professor Donald Fanger is the subject of
Security Matter - C, Bureau file 100-408465, opened
in January, 1954, when there was indication he supported
Communist Party policies and closed 1964 when investigation
indicated he did not qualify under Bureau's criteria for
inclusion on the Security Index and his activities did not
appear to warrant investigation. The only known connection
between Fanger and Riha is that they were both included in
a group of American graduate students selected to attend
Moscow or Lenigrad University in 195°-1959 in exchange for
twenty Soviet graduate students.

Professor Oldrich Leska is the subject of
Internal Security - Czechoslovakia, Bureau file 105~19779.
Leska, born 6/16/27 Czechoslovakia, was in the U. 8S. from
7/17/68 to 9/5/68 and again from 10/15/68 until 6/8/70
when he returned to Czechoslovakia. He was in the U. &.
under the East-West Exchange Program. During the earlier
visit and from October, 1968, until the Summer of 1969, he
was at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, and
from the Summer of 1969 until June, 1970, he was at the
University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois. ‘The file was
opened on the basis of an unusual telephone call received
by a third party from Ljubo Majhanovich. Apparently
Majhanovich, then living in Toronto, Canada, had attended
the University of Colorado from 1966-69 where he had beco:
friendly with Leska. Majhanovich was born in qugostavia,(5)

Aceording to CERVENY, he came to the United States on
November §, 196¢, from Vienna, Austria, destined for the residence
of his uncle in Boulder, Colorado. He stated that upon arrival in
New York City, he spent several days at the residence of Mr. and
Mrs. R. V. GROSSMAN in Brooklyn, New York, who are the aunt and
unole of HANA RIHA, the former wife of THOMAS RIHA,.

CERVENY continved that he arrived in Denver, Colorado, :
via Greyhound Bus on November 16, 1968, and immediately called -
THOMAS RIHA at his residence in Boulder He was advised by RIHA
that he would be unable to come t9 Denver to drive him back to

Company where he had secured employment in the Research and

“ Development Laboratory. During the period he resided with his

being - admitted: to the. United ‘States, as. the matter, to his -knowledge
handled: by.. a beahiartnarhreveerrey Refugee~Committee pies New. York City,

‘ : te.
he’ did not seé TANNENBAUM again uritil March 13, "1969, when “ghe
called him on the telephone and suggested he come to her residence
at 248 Logan Street, where his uncle was also visiting her. He
stated when he arrived at her house, his uncle seemed depressed
and upset over the fact that he was having marital difficulties
with HANA, and that the marriage would probably terminate in
divorce. He stated the purpose of his being invited to
TANNENBAUM's residence appeared to emanate from a desire of his
meets see him, but that nothing of importance occurred during
the visit.

Following the disappearance of his uncle on Merch 15,
1968, he stated TANNENBAUM commenced asking him over to her house
on the pretense of checking up on his immigrant status; however,
it became immediately apparent that the principal purpose of these
invitations was an attempt on the part of TANNENBAUM to have sexual
relations with him. He pointed out there were times when he
entered her residence when she would be partially unclothed, would
attempt to sit on his lap, sit close to him while watching tele-
vision, or would openly suggest that they go to her bedroom for
the purpose of having sexual intercourse. CERVENY stated TANNENBAUM
was physically repulsive to him, and that he would find an immediate
excuse to leave when she commenced making sexual advances to him.

buring the period when he was visiting the TANNENBAUM
residence, CERVENY advised she suggested that she cdopt him, and
actually started adoption proceedings through an attorney in
Denver, STEPHEN L. R. MC NICHOLS, JR.; however, he stated he had
no desire whatsoever to go through with this, and told TANNENBAUM
so. He stated it was about this time that he began to suspect that
TANNENBAUM had no connection with Military Intelligence or had any
influence over his immigration status.

He stated that ‘in May, 1969, he desired to go to Toronto,
Canada, to ettent a wedding of some Czechoslovakian friends, and
he inquired of TANNENBAUM if such would be legal for him to do.
He stated she told him there was nothing for him to worry about;
however, she suggested he consult with Immigration authorities
in Denver rezarding this trip. i iy



Er United States for Canada, he would not be able to return. :
he informed. TANNENBAUM .of ‘this,."she told him.tlrat’ she. had more’
mutnontey” than the Immigration officials; and advised. him: to-go: ‘to.
- Canada ‘regardiess, as. she outranked' the officials in Denver. oe
CERVENY then made the-trip to Cariada without incident, and -learned.
ter: thathe was actually just. fortunate ‘that he vequire i
ari ac ea citizenship papers: ‘at: “any: ‘ting

: ‘tn addition; - “CERVENY stated that in May, 1969, he met
a Czechoslovakian girl in Colorado Springs by the name of MICHEL
BDLIKOVA, who was working at the Broadmoor Hotel, and whom he : ’
eventually introduced to TANNENBAUM. He stated that TANNENBAUM ‘
immediately told the girl of her Military Intelligence and
Immigration connections,-and advised her that she could arrange
to get her a passport. to visit relatives in Czechoslovakia. He
stated that in October, 1969, BDLIKOVA told him that ‘TANNENBAUM
. had recently approached her with a letter written in English
purportedly from THOMAS RIHA to CERVENY. He stated BDLIKOVA was
asked by TANNENBAUM to rewrite the letter in Czechoslovakien, and
that he eventually received this letter postmarked from somewhere
in Canada. He felt at the time he received the letter that it had
not been written by his uncle, and when he was advised by BDLIKOVA
that the letter was a hoax, he began to feel that TANNENBAUM was
a fraud and that his uncle's disappearance could have been for
reasons other than marital discord. He stated that immeidately
after being told of the letter by BDLIKOVA in October, 1969, he
filed a missing persons notice with the Boulder, Colorado Police
Department the following day. He stated the last time he saw
TANNENBAUM was just before or after he made this report to the
Boulder Police Department.

With regard to CERVENY's association with GALYA
TANNENBAUM, he recalled that on several occasions she tuid him
that she would like to recruit him into Military Intelligence, as
his engineering background and language ability would be "extremely
useful to us." She also told him that if he were in the United
States "working for the other side," she would shoot him. TANNEN-
BAUM also told CERVENY that she had originally met THOMAS RiHA in
Chicago, and that after she came to Colorado, he followed her for the
purpose of marrying her; however, the marriage did not teke place
as RIHA was unable to get along with her children. He stated that
upon reflection, he feels that his uncle actually believed that
TANNENBAUM was connected in some official capacity with the United
States Government, and that there was something in their relation-—
ship which he feels gave TANNENBAUM some type of influence over the
actions of his une te; vomever in conversation with b.

RVENY also. recalled. that. -in December,- 1s 8, his:

: father visited ‘him, and during the visit,‘ showed hima ‘Semone -
brace let which he -had smuggiedinto:the United States for the: -
purpose “of. selling -for® Tatiye!in’-Czechoslovakia.:

Pie father had previously corresponded with another indiy ‘idual -~

“by ‘the name‘of RIHA‘in San Antonio, Texas, who was no relation
to his uncle, but whom his father had known in Czechoslovakia.
According to CERVENY, his father made a trip to San Antenio to
leave this bracelet with the RIHA in San Antonio for him to
attempt to sell; however, the bracelet was eventually returned
to CERVENY from the RIHA in San Antonio, who advised him he could
locate no buyer. Thereafter, he showed the bracelet to TANNEN~
BAUM, who indicated a desire to buy it. Both went to a jeweler
in the Denver Hilton Hotel, who appriased the bracelet at $350.
TANNENBAUM, however, offered him $500 for the bracelet, and
actually paid him $400 in cash with a promise to pay him an
additional $100 later, which he never received.

CERVENY recalled another incident which furthered
his suspicions of TANNENBAUM in regard to a will which he
witnessed at her insistence. By way of background, he explained
that in the spring of 1969, TANNENBAUM introduced him to an
elderly man by the name of GUSTAV FREDERICH INGWERSEN, a plastics
engineer and a native of Germany, who owned some type of plastics
plant in Denver, Colorado. He stated he had formerly done some
work in plastics, and TANNENBAUM suggested that INGWERSEN might
help him get established in this field. As a result of this
meeting, CERVENY became friendly with INGWERSEN, and in the
company of TANNENBAUM and her two children, made two vacation
trips to New Mexico with him. He stated these trips were in
either April or May, 1969, and in June, 1969, TANNENBAUM advised
him that INGWERSEN had died. Then on July 5, 1969, TANNENBAUM
had him visit her residence where she told him that INGWERSEN
had drawn up a will and signed it prior to his death, but had
neglected to have two witnesses sign it in accordance with
Colorado law. She said that INGWERSEN liked CERVENY and had
intended to ask him to witness the will, but had died before this
could be accomplished. She then coaxed him for over an hour to
witness this document, and still believing she was a bona fide
official in some Governmental capacity, he aia his signature
to the will.

CERVENY concluded by stating that TANNENBAUM had never
obteined anything resuit of her represen=

Boulder, Colorado; 7 ‘the Black Bear. inn,”
“introduced her to a Professor of History at the University of
Colorado by the name of THOMAS RIHA, also a native of Czechosio-
vakia, and that thereafter she and her husband became friendly
with RIHA. : .

Mrs. STEIN advised that in April, 1968, RIHA visited SEeSEEES
the restaurant in the company of a Czechoslovakian eitizen by the
name of JIRI CERVENY, who advised her that he had a son, ZDENEK
CERVENY, who had recently escaped from Czechoslovakia into Vienna,
Austria. She stated JIRI CERVENY was from Prague and that ZDENEK
CERVERY is a nephew of RIHA. They inquired if Mrs. STEIN would be
able to assist his son in coming to the United States, particularly,
gwith regard to obtaining employment for him. Mps. STEIN advised
both RIHA and CERVENY that she would attempt to assist in this
endeavor through her attorney, PAUL MORRIS, in Bo vr, Colorade. EEE]

Mes. STEIN recalled that in Septe:

HRUSKOVA,, and that. subsequent ‘to the maryiage,..a reception w.
held at the Black Bear Inn. She stated that while the reception
was in progress, TANNENBAUM appeared, uninvited, and immediately
sought out RIHA, took him to the bar section of the restaurant,
and commenced a long, serious conversation with him which lasted
for approximately one hour. She stated that RIHA's bride became
extremely upset over this, as TANNENBAUM would not allow anyone
to interrupt their conversation. Mrs. STEIN advised that on one
occasion she went into the bar to tell RIHA that his bride was
becoming very upset, and was answered in an angry manner by
TANNENBAUM to "leave them alone." Following this conversation,
the content of which is unknown to Mrs. STEIN, she stated RIHA
appeared to be extremely upset, and although TANNENBAUM left
immediately, RIHA seemed to have lost all interest in the
reception.

Following the incident during the wedding reception,
Mrs. STEIN advised that TANNENBAUM again visited her at the
Black Bear Inn concerning the immigration case of ZDENEK CERVENY,
during which she mentioned to TANNENBAUM that she owned some
property in Lyons on which she. desired to build an apartment
house. At this time TANNENBAUM told her that she was a Colonel
in Military Intelligence, and was soon to be promoted to the
rank of General. She told Mrs. STEIN that she could utilize
some influence in securing an FHA loan for her; that she had the
authority to deport her at any time; and intimated to Mrs. STEIN
that for a percentage of the loan obtained, she would obtain
same; and if Mrs, STEIN did not agree to this arangement, she wouid
have her deported. Mrs. STEIN again pointed out that she considered
TANNENBAUM a "nut," and told her thet all of immigration and
business dealings were handled through her attorney.

Mrs. STEIN stated that to the best of her recollection,
the above was the last time she saw TANNENBAUM, and in February,
1869, she made a trip to Columbia, Scuth America, where she had
resided for approximately ten years befcre coming to the United
States, and did not again return to Lyons until March 18, 1969,
following the disappearance of RIHA from Boulder, Colorado, on
March 15, 1968.

friend.

At the outset of the interview, it was explained to
LEBRA that the purpose of the interview was to ascertain any
available information from her concerning Mrs. GALYA TANNENBAUM
on whom this Bureau is conducting an investigation under the
Federal Impersonation Statute.

Miss LEBRA advised that to the best of her recollection
RIHA never did mention anyone to her by the name of TANNENBAUM or
any individual connected with Military Intelligence or the United
States Immigration and Naturalization Service. She stated that
if TANNENBAUM had been a close friend of RIHA's, this. fact would
probably have been known to her, as she and RIHA generally asso-
ciated with the same circle of friends in the University community.

“prior ‘to theiy meeting. He advised ‘that ar er RIHA ‘came to the - + o4
‘University of Celorado he knew him as a fellow faculty menber of :
the Department of History and had dinner with him on two cr three
occasions. He advised their relationship was casual and could net
have been considered a profound relationship. : :

FISCHER-GALATI advised he first met GALYA TANNENBAUM
sometime in May, 1969, after the disappearance of rrofessor RIHA.
Hé advised his object in meeting TANNENBAUM was -to determine if she
were a "colonel" as described in hearsay. He advised he was con~-
vinced she was not connected with any kind of intelligence work
and knew nothing of Eastern Eurepean history. He recalled that
TANNENBAUM stated she had known RIHA for many years and indicated
she had helped RIHA come to the United States but gave no further
explanation, He also recalled that TANNENBAUM displayed 2a “Power
£ Attorney" document which was contained in a let
Signed by TOM RIHA. He advised the most signi
document to him was the date of same, which y rece
January 5. 1368. FISCHER-GALATI pointed out that January Ss,
is the date of the overthrow of the Czechosiovakian Neubert

which time NOVOTONY was replaced by DUBCEK, and at this
the official who was in control of passports disappeared ar
sequently showed up in Montreal, Canada. He reealled that TA
-indicated she carried a gun in her purse and that her car had some
special equipment, but TANNENBAUM did not elaborate further. Ke
advised that TANNENBAUM was extremely careful jn her conversatiozis
with him and made no allegations.

FISCHER-GALATI advised his second meeting with TANNENBs
oceured on October 1, 1969, at 2:15 p.m., same obtained from his
notebook. He recalled that TANNENBAUM called him on the telephone
and arranged to meet him in front cf thie Colorado Book Store
Boulder. He recalled that her car was parked legaily the
aforementioned location. He recalled that sie was anxious to
determine why a check had “bounced” in RIEA's bank account. He
recalled she wanted to know if t University was continuing to
deposit RIHA's salary to his hank account, as all University faculty

“whereabouts:

He recalled his third meeting with TANNENBAUM occured
about five days later at the same location, although this time
TANNENBAUM was accompanied by a small female child about three
years of age. He advised her of the amount the University had
deposited to RIHA's acccunt.. At this time TANNENBAUM told him
her real name was not GALY. TANNENBAUM, but something else which
she did not disclose, and added that she was about ready to leave
town. .He advised of no contact with TANNENBAUM since their last
meeting. .

STEPHEN FISCHER-GALATI advised that the date of the
document mentioned above of January 5, 1968, and its historical
significance disturbs him. He stated if RIHA was not "bumped
off" by TANNENBAUM, then he assumes that RIHA's disappearance
may have been connected with an unknown intelligence matter,
which is pure conjecture on his part FISCHER-GALATI also receiled
that in September, 1968, Professor RIHA requested that an adverti
ment for a travel bureau be run in the "Eastern European Quarter}
which GALATI described as an international journal to promote cul-
tural contact with Eastern European Countries. He advised RIHA
did not indicate if the advertisement was run for a friend or if
RIHA had any financial interest in the travel agency named Treasure
Tours, 1010 St. Catherine Way, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. FISCH
GALATI advised that because of the reasons mentioned, he sometime
believes that RIHA could be in Canada.

Professor FISCHER~GALATI advised that in April, 1969,
he contacted a Mr. FRITZ of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
Denver, Colorado, regarding the sudden leaving of Professor THOMAS
RIHA of the University of Colorado. Hr. FRITZ advised him that he
had no knowledge of the matter but would check into same. Profe
FISCHER-GALATI stated he was later recontacted by FRITZ, who statec

the disappearance had nothing to do with the CIA and that RIHA's
leaving was a personal matter connected with personal problems.

dded ‘that -inasmuch ds-it’ then
voluntarily, he also concluded he hed no reason to fear for the
safety of RIHA. Professor FISCHER-GALATI said that if he had
been subsequentiy quoted in the "Cclorado Daily" or any other
newspaper as saying that RIHA had left voluntarily and was safe,
such quotation would have been correct.

Professor FISCHER-GALATI continued that he did not
feel, however, that the explanation about RIHA was adequate and
for that reason subsequently directed a letter to the Chief of
the Foreign Agents Registration section within the Justice Depart-
ment, whom he knew well. He thereafter received a reply that the
Chief to whom he directed the letter was deceased.

He stated he thereafter directed a second letter to
the same section mentioned above within the Justice Department in
mid-December, 1963, again inquiring about RIHA, but as yet has
received no reply.

He stated he did not know of anything of value ever
. received by TANNENBAUM as a result of any representation.

FROM: Steven K.. Blackhurst
Assistant Special Counsel for

SUBJECT: SSC Letter Dated February 18, 1976

Attached is a letter from the Senate Select
Committee dated February 18, 1976, which requests
interviews with FBI agents who wrote various men-
-oranda concerning the Black Panther Party in Chicago.
Because such interviews might impair the Department's
ability to conduct a defense in the Hampton trial, in
Chicago, I have asked the Department attorneys hand-
ling that case to give us their views on an appropriate
Yesponse to Senator Church's letter. One possible re-
sponse would be te provide the SSC with the transcripts
of the FBI agents testimony at the trial concerning

these memoranda, instead of allowing the SSC te inter-
view these agents. We wovld appreciate it if the FBI
would also consider what response would be appropriate
-to this letter.

a discussion ensued between Bureau representatives and
SSC Staff Members as to what effect the enactment of the
Privacy Act of 1974 ha@ on investigations conducted by
the FBI relative to domestic subversive grovps. On this
occasion, one of the Staff Members present requested that
this Bureau furnish the SSC with a copy of all instructions
sent to Bureau field divisions by PBI Headquarters, which
instructions would have a bearing on the conduct of this
Bureau's "Domestic Intelligence Investigations.”

Attached, in response to the above request, are
copies of three Headquarters communications sent to Bureau
field divisions containing instructions responsive to the
above request. Also attached is one copy of a communication

Director Sec'y __

It was brought to the attention of the Legal Counsel
Division that in the Senate Select Committee report concerning
COINTELPRO the identities of Agents were contained which are
below the level of Section Chief. The prior procedure and policy
of the Senate Select Committee was not to include anybody below
a policymaking position which it equated with Section Chief or oo
above.

F. A. O. Schwartz, Counsel to captioned Committee, was
contacted concerning this matter and Schwartz stated that he
wanted to assure the Bureau that there would be no names of Agent
personnel included in the report under the title of Section Chief.
He indicated that their procedures and policies concerning utili-
zation of the idéntity of Agent personnel will be consistent. with
the policies established by their Bureau mail opening report. This
report was written by James Dick of the Committee and contains the
identity of only one Section Chief and that is William A. Branigan.
No one below the rank of Section Chief was identified. In fact,
Dick did not identify SACs

NOTE:

This is the first instance wherein the SSC has
made available for review a proposed rough draft of a seg-
ment of the upcoming SSC report. It is expected that other
segments will be made available by the Committee Staff
Members. It was necessary to review this proposed draft
in the offices of the SSC since they do not contemplate
permitting proposed drafts to leave their premises. The
approval for the use of information from the 2 classified
documents has been coordinated with the IS-2 Section of
the Intelligence Division and with the Budget and Accounting
Section of the Administrative Division. The handling of

the budget figure as set forth has been approved by Asst.

or : : " Informers were used extensively in FBI investigations of *
possible Communist links to the antiwar movement. An example is

the FBI's coverage of various antiwar teach-ins and conferences |
sponsored by the Universities Committee on Problems of War and

Peace. A forty-one page report from the Philadelphia office-~-based |
on coverage by thirteen informants and confidential sources--described
in complete detail a “public hearing on Vietnam." A Communist Party

official had “urged all CP members" in the area to attend, and one

of the organizers was alleged to have been a Communist in the early
1950's. Upon receipt from an informant of a list of the speakers,
the FBI culled its files for data on their backgrounds. One was

described by a source as a Young Socialist Alliance "sympathizer."

Another’ was ‘a conscientious objector to military service. A third
had contributed $5.000 to the National Committee to Abolish the
House Committee on Un-American Activities. A speaker representing
the W.E.B. DuBois Club was identified as a Commmist. The*FBI
covered the meeting with an informant who reported practically
verbatim the remarks of all the speakers, including the following:

The Chairman of the Philadelphia Ethical Society
