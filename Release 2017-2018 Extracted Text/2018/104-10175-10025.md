The Station feels that perhaps ve understated the degree

of concealment as outlined in reference B.

It is agreed that a

sophisticated echnical search would probably find the device we

planted but all personnel at the Station involved alri this operation

agreed that such a search wos most unlikely.

The case officer

dealing directly with LIRINGo3 also minimized the possibility of

-IRING"3 making any kind or a search...

all of these points were

considered before makinn the installation.

2a At the moment, be do not feel there is inaunh reason po

justily the rises involved in anoder surreptitious entry.

will hoever remain alert and be prepared

to take corrective action.

Forwarded herowith are two reports dated 28 April

dealing with the activities of tirING-3.

Although LIRING-3 and his wife moved back to their old

apartment on Tacubaya in early May, LIRING-3 uses the apart

mont covered by LIFEAT for "bucinose" purpesos.

apparently felt that the apartment covered by LIFEAT was

much above what they can really afford and was afraid that the

local Cubans might ask questions in this connection. LIRING-A's

father, incidentally finally succeeded in getting a

visa and is coming to Mexico City in the near iuture to

spend two or three weeks with his daughter.

The attached report dated 8 May indicates that

LIRING 3 may have found another local channel to the Guatemalan

FAR guerrillas.

Station traces on Silvia Conzalcz Irin and

Raul. Moreno were negative.

28 April, 1967

Subject:

Analysis of LIFEAT Iraiiic kelating. to IIRING/3. fOI

the Feriod 19-26 April, 1957.

1. In revlewing the traffic for the period indicated Porton fuzzé

valuaule confirmation of LIRING/3 and IIRING/4 contact with Rames

Abreu, indicating that both persons complied vith Rowton's suggertions.

LIRING/3'g telephonic contacts with Ebrique Morales In Guatemale City

confirmed reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the eve.

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 1s a dinner enezze-

ment which Enrique Morales bad in Guatemala City on 25/4/67 wits "Iriends"

of Morales' wife, Esperanza. SAN-10 (17.5) also reveals that IT Q/3

and Horules are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of parses

or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatemala or San Cristóbal for -egale

in Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIRTU3/3

mentioned the opportunities in this line to Rowton previously, t= Row-

ton did not react favorably).

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of tze take

which will serve to clarify them in relationship to reports made to him

by LIRING/3 and IIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Raniro Abreu: On 22/4/67, shortly aftze gowton

suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect taroug

him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephazed the

Embassy and attampted to reach Abreu. From the content and toze of ber

questions and remarks, it appears obvious that LIRING/4 has not had re-

cent contact with the Cuban mission. She asks when Abreu is leaving for

Havana, but is given no information. She tries sgain at aboit 1900 and

2000, but there is no answer. She finallt gets through to abrea on

14-13-26

who promises to come to her home between 1000 and 1100 the

following day (23/4/67). She has to give Abreu the address, indicaiing

that he 1s not fauiliar with the home add.ess of LIRING/3 or/.

SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that Abreu called or talked to IFING/4

on the telephone three times on 24/4/67. LIRNG/4 makes referezce to

"so much analysis, so many theories and ideas" which apparently vere dis

cussed between ber and Abreu at their 23/4/67 conversation. inner re-

maris made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu indicate that Abreu 15, or watna

1a substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet had a chance

to talk directly with LIRING/, to get ber version of the conversations

with Aureu. Apparently in order to put Abreu off (in his amonous de-

signs) LIPING/4 teals him on 25/4/67 that her husband suspocts that

sorething is going on between shen. In roply to Abreu's anxious ques

tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husband asked her whether she liked

Abreu and wether Abreu like her, to which she said that the replied it

the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off

without alienating bin). Abreu's visit to the ppartment ind his pro

poed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confimmed by the latter in his

report to Rowton on 27/4/67.

Conversations Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) IIRING/3 asks

his Guatemalan friend (Jacobo Fodriguez Padilla?) whether it matters 11

the harth cantificate to for a person 10 years older? Jacohe replied

In the negative, but would prefer it of a person ten years younger-LI-.

RDIG/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his possession by

25-26/4/67. This is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state-

ment made to him some two weeks previously that when he wont to pick us

the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of bis

half-brother (and the lawyer Folando Riojas) he discoverid that it was

for a person born in 1916 and hence useless for himself. LIRING/3 also

reported to Rowton that Jacobo had contacted bim recently and asked for

help in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation

therefore would indicate that IIRING/3 plans to sive Jacobo the false

document originally procured for himself through his half-brother. LI

RING/3, horever, has not revezled this plan to Rowton.

SAI-11 (16.0) reveals that LIrING/3 informed his brother two days later

that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but 1t la "impossible

to get the birth certificate. Ibe book no longer exiests." He adds that

he has written his half-brother a lotter explaining everything. IIRING/3

reportod to Rowton that he had asked his balf-brother to obtain an

"acta notorial" in lieu of brita certificate and hoped to have the doci

ment soon.

1. Rowton met with IIRING/3 at the safebouse at 1800 on 4 Nay, 1957.

LIRING/3 reported that he bad been working with the Secretarait of

Commerce and Industry to obtaintho license for the importation of the

plastic flowers and that he had told Sorique Korales Guerra to stand

by until the formalities of the license were completed. He added that

as a matter of fact he had not made any commitment to Morales and did

not feel under any obligation to continue to use him, even in the flower

business, especially if Roston had any further reservations about bin.

2. Regarding his friend Sergio González Marin of the Secretariat of

Commerce and Industry, LIRING/3 comented that, as he had reported pre

viously to Rowtor, the latter had formerly been a member of the Comnunist

Party of Mexico, but was no longer active. LIRING/3 added that his sis-

ter, bonever, calria

Conafled Marin, was a very active nember of the

Party and married tol a Raúl Moreno, who was also most probably a jember

of the Communist Party. LINING/3 continued that both Raúl loreno and

Silva and himself (LIRING/3) had a iutual friend Sergialtaldez who had

excellent contacts in extreme leftist circles. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez was the son of the Siempre correspondent and associate of Alberto

Domingo, as well as fico Galán. According to LIRING/3, Sergio Valdez 18

not a formal party member and still a student uf art at the University.

LIRINE/3 stated that he knew nim farily well since be had been one of

his (LIRING/3's) students for several years. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez' teiephone number is 20-90-10, ext. 12.

3. In addition to the above, LIRINJ/3 recounted that about 2 Nay, 1967, in

a conversation with Raúl Moreno, he bad learned that Moreno is friendly

with the FAR responsible for Propaganda at the National University. iI-

RING/3 commented that such a person would surely know "Garcia" of FAR,

and that therefore he planned to arrange a meeting with him through Rall

Moreno at the first opportunity.

4. In preparation for a possible ICFLUTTER examination of LIRING/3 on

9 or 10 May, Rowton stated to him at the end of the meeting that be was

prepariug a number of questions that still bothered him so that LIRING/3

could sive a definitive reply that would close the matter for once and

all. LIRIKG/3 replied that he was anxious to answer any questions Rowton

might have and hoped that this would resolve any problem and dispell ang

lingering doubts that Rowton

might still have concerning his bona fidea.

for the Period 1-30 April, 1967.

1. During the month of April, Rowton was able, through valuable leads

furnished by LIfEAT intercepts, to put strong pressure on IIRING/3 to

present acceptable proof of a number of staterents that be had made to

Rowton. At his meeting with LIRISG/3 on 19 April, Rowton confronted II-

RING/3 with suspicions be entertained concernig

the proposed acquisi

tion of a false birth certificate as well as the identity of "Garcia",

the FAR representative. The session, which lasted over two hours, shook

IIRING/3 so much emotionally that LIRING/4 became alarmed and telephoned

Rowton's answering service the folloring morning. Rowton was able to ex-

ploit this opportunity to talk privately with LIRING/4 and to lay the

foundation for an independent working relationship with her against tar-

gets of interest in the local mission.

2. In addition to initiating a positive effort to verify LIRING/3's bona

fides and reliability, Rowton's confrontation paved the way toward a

closer and more productive relationship with hin in the future. LIRING/3

assured Rowton that be considered his work for Rowton the most important

thing in his life and was willing to do anything to prove that his in-

tuetions were nonorable and dis reporting reliaule. As a rasult Ronton is

currently in a position to challenge any or all of LIRING/3's statements,

and to give him much more specific direction than was possible in the

past.

3. The following are Rowton's comments on specific developments during the

month in summary form:

a) Developments with respect to Cuba: On 19 April, LIFEAl intercept

SAN-7(9.0) revealed that both LIPING/3 and LIRING/4 were virtually

Isolated from the Cubars. In the conversation with the Mexican Rojas

LIRING/3 stated that "he and his wife no longer have anything to do

with those people", and LIRING/4, in conversation with the same person,

added that she "feels like vomiting when sbe sees them". Botu LIRING/3

and 14 admitted this situation to Rowton on 22 April when he talked to

each privately. LIRING/4 explained her dislike for the Cuban employees

of the mission originated in the "rude manner in which she was thrown

out into the street" some six monthe previously. LIRING/3 confessed,

that he could not explain why his close frieads Arnol Rodriguez and

Rene Ochoa had not communicated with him over the past month, despite

his messages and telephone calls. He felt an uneasy suspicion that the

Julian Lopez alfair, as well as the Rico Galán letter, had caused certain

elements localiy and in Havana to become hostile toward hin.. ITniHG/3

noted that Eepeda had been present when LIRIlG/4 had blown her top in

the Ambassador's office and that he (LIRING/3) had turned down Cepeda'a

invitation to accompany him to Havana shortly after the return of Julian

Lopez. In any case LIRING/3 agreed that the best, or, nore candidly, the

only course of action opez to him was to play a waiting game and continue

his work with the Guatemalans in the hope that the Cubans, sooner or later

would recontact him. He stressed that only after he has established firm

and viable cover through the plastic flower business will be be able to

face a thorough interrogation by the DSE in Havana (which he expects,

dealt with

should he return at this time). He feels that he

wak enough Greeks

to date ( Econonou, Frevolis, Batsakis, Gasdaglis, Arvanitis) in both Mexico

City and Guatesala City, to justify his relationship with Rowton on a

purely commercial level, should that become necessary.

LIR NG/3 accepted

'Rowton'

s recommendation that LIRING/4 overcone her

apparent visceral dislike for the Cubang in the mission and effect a re-

conciliation with them as soon as possible. Arter Rowton's personal appeal

to her, she succeeded in recontacting Ramiro Abreu on 22 April, and re-

mained in almost daily contact with him until he left Mexico on 30 April.

Through Abreu she re-established contact witz Curbelo, Cepeda, and other

employees of the Consulate, inciuding Inrique Cicard. This gave LIRING/3

an opportunity to chat with Abreu concerning his own situation with the

result that breu promised to get sone word out to LIRILG/3 concerning

the attitude of bis friends in Havana. Abreu invited LIRING/3 back to

Havana, but the latter turned this down diplomatically (for the reasons

mentioned above•

b) Developsents with Respect to Guatemala: The identity of "Garcia",

the FAR represestative, has continued to occupy the attention of Rowton.

An attempt by the Station team to surveilt Garcia when he allegedly picked

up the medicine from IIRING/3 on 28 March was unsuccessful (Rowton spotter

LIRING/3 leaving his house at about 0815, just as the team was taking pos1-

ticns and before they could tdentify LIRING/3). Another opportunity to

survell LIRIiG/3, Garcia,as woll as Enrique Morales, was lost on the even

Matters, however, have been simplified after.

the confrontation of LIRING/3

by Boston on 22 April, inasnuch as LIRING/3 promised to notify Rowton 1n

advance of the next neeting with Garcia, explicitly for the purpose of

Rowton's getting a look at Garcia to identify bin. In addition on 1 lay,

LIRDG/3 infored Rowton that Garcia had telephoned him the preceding day

to set a date for their next neeting on 18 lej, when Garcia stated he

would be back from Guatenala. LIziT take for 30 April should confirm or

refute this statement.

During the month LIRING,3 maintained contact with Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla

Alicia Echeverría as well as Carsen Carrasco. LIFTAT Intercepts confimmed

LIRING/3 reports, at least as far as actual contact was concerned.

c) Developments with Respect to the False Birth Certificate: Uppa his re-

turo from northern Nexico on 6 April, LIKING/3 reported that he had made

arrangements to obtain a false birth certificate for luture use through

his half-brother and a certain lawyer named Folando Riojas(for & 2,000

peso cool, II221n intercoate arouged Pawton's suspicions concerning the

role, if any, played by Riojas, and served as a biasis for Ronton's heart-

to-heart talk with LIRING/3 on 22 ipril, LIRING/3 clained that the false

birth certificate produced by his half-brother and Riojas was not suitable

since it applied to a person born in 1916. This appears to bave been the

tauth, as indicated in LIRING/3's conversatica with Jacobo Rodriguez Pa-

dilla on 23 April (SAN-1C(2.5), although Rowtin still has doubts concern-

ting the existence and role plajed by Rolando riojas. Ilkewise, LIRING/3'3

report that his half-brother was to provide hin with an affidavit in lieu

of birth certificate in the nane of Alberto Zérate Vidal, (a name chosen

by LIRING/3 himself), was proved to be true wben LIRTuG/i gave Riwton the

originalin of the court papers on 29 April.

d) Covor hspects of the IIRING/3 Operation: Iuring the first week of April

KIRING/3 traveled to northern Mexico (Sabines, juevo Loredo) and Del Rio, :

Texas, and, in collaboration with his half-brother and a certain Sergio.

Arche of V1lla Acuña, established a notional company ("Floriex") in Del

Rio as a buger for the plastic flowers assembled in San Cristóbal. This

Wallace B. Roston Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton met with LIkIlG/3 at the sa'ehouse (Tacubaya, briefly at

1000 on 1 May, 1967. LIRIIG/3 reported that "Garcia" had telephoned

him on the preceding day to tell bin that he had to made another trip,

this time to Guatenala and that he would be returning on 18 May, 1967.

IIRING/3 added that Garcia Indicated that he would see I.RING/3 on that

date or a few days thereafter, and planned to introduce him to a

friend who would be in a position to see bin nore frequently in the

future. LIRIlG/3 told Rowton be again mentioned the payment for the

medicines and Garcia assured him that it would be settled at their

next meeting.

2. LIRING/3 also reported that Abreu departed on 30 April, rather than

on 29 April,as anticipates. He said that he had therefore had achance to

meet siüh nureù again, me latter encouraged bim to keep in touch with

him and promised to set some sort of message to LIRE:G/3 from Arnol

Rodriguez and/or Clenfuego. According to LIRING/3 Abreu asked him whether

he would be willing to visli his friends in avana again in the near

future to discuss his situation personally, indicatize that be would

arrange for an invitation as soon as he returned. IJAIiG/3 told Rowton

he thanked Abreu but stated that at the moment he was very busy with his

commercial obligations and could not find the time. Ze assured Abreu that

as soon as he got things rolling in San Cristóbal and Guatemala, be

would welcome the chance to visit ravana again.

3. LIRING/3 then stated that he and LIRING/i had talised over the matter

of her father's visit at length, and bad also talked again to bim by tele-

phone In response to his two calls), and had come to the conclusion that

It was more practical tzat LIRING/4's father come to Mexico City after all,

since a trip to Montreal was too costly and it appeared impossible to con-

vince LIRING/4'g father that he should not come to visit his daughter at

her hone. LIPING/3 added that he planned to have LIZING/4 take ner fatber

on as many excursions as possible outside lexico City to keep his visit

•as quiet as possible. He said that in any event lIAING/4's father could

not make the trip befora 20 May, 1967, when bis vacation would begin.

4. IIRING/3 then mentioned that both he and LIRING/4 felt that they should

returu to the Tacubaya spartment to live. le explained that LIRING/4 had

originally moved into the former safehouse at his request to satiofy the

bees accomplished and sna Sanchez was not likely to ask any further

questions. Also both he and TIRilG/4 were worried about suspiciong that

they continued to reside there. Abreu had already raised his eyebrows

slightly and appeared satisfied wiia LIRING/3's explenation that he bad

rented the apartment for sone friends who were out of the country tempor

arily. LIRING/4 is not comfortable in the apartment, especially since she

may have to face her former colleagues frequently is she resumes her work

In the Consulate. According to LIRING/3, she feels they are better off

in relatively nodest surroundings, since they bave fewer questicas to ans

wer and explanations to give. Their old apartment (tacubaga) also has

two separate bedrooms and would be more convenient when her father cones

to visit tuem. IRING/3 stated that he could, of course, continue to

use the Atoyae apartment to soe forton and weet discreetly wits thailan

tacts, as previously.

bagged.

5. In view of the above, Rokton suggested that LIRING/3 infor is friends,

particularly the Cubans, that the Atoyac apartnent had been rented for

his Greek friends from Guatemala and Venezuela who planned to establish

a plastics factory here in Mesico and needed a place to stay during their

visits. LIRING/3 felt this would be acceptable, since by now he had good

working contacts with Batsakis and Gasdaglis in Guatemala City and would

Boon be seeing irvanitis and possibly others. Rowton also suggested that

If it became necessary to explain his contacts with the Greeks to the Cu

bans, he should say that his original contact was with Pandelis Econonou

re the importa lin of Meteras cognac (this is true) and that he had met

Stylianos Prevolis and continued to work through him on the recommendation

of Economou (when the latter returned to Atbens)•

6. LIRING/3 stated thit he planned to revisit his friends in the Secreta-

riat of Commerce (particularly a señor Llamas of the Plastics Committee)

to obtain the import license for the first shipment of disassembled

flowers to San Cristóbal.

and his wife. He indicated thet Esperanza Morales knows

Subject:

Wallace 3. Rowton Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton net with LIRING/3 at the safehouse at 1800 on 27 April,

and at 0845 on 29 April, 1967. It the first meeting LIRING/3 gave

Rowton the new letterhead paper of the Plastifor de San Cristóbal

company and report:] that he had been in telephonic contact with

Enrique fiorales in Guatenala City and has passed on to him Rowton's

message instructing him, (as per LIRING/?'s suggestion) to contact

Mr. Constantinos Gasdaglis of the Metaloplástica Guatenalteca to be

shown through the factory and given some unassembled amaples of the

plastic flowers. This had been suggested by LIRIiG/7 inasruch as MI.

Angelo Arvaritis had not arrived in Guatenala City from Caracas as

anticipated.

2. At both meetines LIRING/3 reported almost daily contact with Ramiro

Abreu either pessonally or by phone. He stated that he had had a private

talk with Abreu, in wich the latter attempted to snooth over the ap

parent difficulties liring/3 was having with the Cubans, by stating that

nobody really had anything against LIRING/3. When the latter showed bis

dissatisfaction with such

a brush-off, Abreu mumbled sonetbibg about

the Julian Lopez affair and added that there were "certain thiugs he

was not in a position to discuss". Abreu insinutated that Cepeda was

more or less hostile. although he himself did not share Cepeda's atti-

tude. At this point IIRING/3 inserted the comment that when LIRING/4

blew up some six months aga(on the day that sue was fired, in the An

bassador's office, Cepeda was present, and he apparently resented the

action even more than the Ambassador. LIMING/3. agreed with Routon that

in light of the current situation the best course of action vould be to

give LIRING/4 a chance to re-establish cordial relationg with her forzer

collesgues, particularly Cepeda, since she had the advantage of being a

Cuban and former employee herself.

3. with regard to other comments made by Abreu, LIRING/3 stated that be

defiaitely felt that Abreu was naking a pitch for direct and continuing

contact with him, even after Abreu returned to Havssa. LIRING/3 stated

to Rowton that he gently brushed this off, stating to Abreu that he had

certain understaddings with Arnol Rodriguez and snant Cienfuego and for

that reason did not feel free to enter into any operational relatioship

with anyone olse. He concluded this discussion with a comment that if

Abrou could somehow get a message to bim from either Arnol Rouriguez or

Cienfuego designating Abreu as their liaison, IIRI'GY3 would be glad to

accommodate. LIRING/3 added to Rowton that he gave Abreu a sketchy idea

of what he was doing in establishing co-nercial ties with both Guate=ala

Abreu appeared intensely interested and when LIRING/3 showed

him the letterhead of the new"cospany" in San Cristóbal, Abreu snapped

up the paper and envelope and slipped tien into his pocket. LIRING/3 told

Rowton that he expressed to Abreu his intention of continuing his efforts

along the commercial lines, regardless of the lack of enthusiann shorn to

him by the Cubans.

4. At the 29 April reeting LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that Enrique Morales

had returned safely from Guatenala City, after having met with Constantine

Gasdaglis and obtained from hin samples of the flowers. Since Ro::ton had

almost reached the conclusion that LIRIlC/3 has known Enrique Morales for

several years (contrary to his story thet he met him through "Garcia")Bow-

ton threw in at this point the comment toat e had been checking oi su

rales, through a Mexican Dunn and Bradstreet type firm he uses in business,

and found that Morales has a poor dredit rating, is married, and is an

artist by profession ( actual source of this info is LIFEAT intercepts).

IIFING/3 appeared surprised at the accuracy of Rowton's report and adaittee

that Morales was a painter, although he did not earn enough from his work

to live. IIRING/3 olso stated that Morales had used the 500 pesos pajzent

he had made to him to liquidate an overdue loan at a bank, but that he was

currently out of debt and in good credit standing.

So At the same meeting IIRING/3 reported that he had been in touch with

his half-brother regarding the false birthcertificate and informed his

half-brother that the one presented to him was for a man born in 1916 and

hence useless for his own ax purposes. according to LIRING/3, his bother

proposed an even better idea, the procurement of an "acta notorial" in

which it would state that the person named therein had never been regis-.

tered. LIRING/3 pointed out that this would be more valid legally even

than a birthcertificate since it would be isnued by a court rather than

simply by the Rigistro Civil. He then added that he might fortunately

Kill two birds with one atone, but using the aifidavit in lieu of birth

certificate for himself and give the fals birthcertificate to his friend

Jacobo (Rodriguez Radilla) who had asked bim to help procure a false docu

ment. Rowton agreed that this would be the best solution and ask wben LI

RING/3 hored to have the papers. He replied that his half-brother had al-

ready sent the acta notorial on the norning bus from Sabinas (Coah.) and

that he was to pick it up from the bus driver early that sane afternoon.

6. LIRING/3 then reported to Roston that the Consulate had asked LIRIiG/4

to come back to work on a part-time basis. According to IIRIiG/3, bota

he and IInIlG/4 dragsed their feet on any connitment until they could re-

fer the matter to Rowton. LIRING/3 commented that the thought of LIRING/4

being again in such close contact with such types did not make him happy

but he agreed with Rowton that this perhaps would serve to re-establish

his own relationship with then. LIRING/3 ad-itted that it had been very

convenient to bave LIRING/4 inside the establishment, especially since

she could pick up messages for him and keep her ear to the ground and ber

eyes open for gossip. Rowton replied that in view of this development he

felt that te should have another private chat with IIRING/4 and asked II-

RIFG/3 to inform her that he would be calling on her that afternoon at

about 1700. LIRING/3 discreetly stated that he planned to be out at that

time in any case seeing his chiären (by his ex-wiie).

7. Rowton spent sone 90 minutes with

LIRITG/4 at ber home that afternoon.

She reported that she

had made out much better that expected with Abreu,

who came running when

she telephoned him shortly after Rowton left her on

the evening of 22 April. She added that be came to the house that evering

in the compary of Curbelo aml made a date to see her againthe mxt norning.

Sue commented that Abreu, who had always had a sort of crush on her, was

delighted and pleasantly surprised by her initiative. He confessed that

he thought LIRING/4 wanted a visa to go back home, and was relieved to

find that she was not in any difficulty. ITRING/4, in her typical candia

manner, aditted that Abreu's interest in ber was probably personal, but

ahe felt that she had accomplished what Fowton wanted in her own feminine

Way. Rowton congratualted her and asked her to continue ber efforts, parti

cularly with Cepeda and the others in the nission.

8. LIRING/4 then explained that on her visit to the inbassy, Abreu, in the

presence of Cepeda and others, almost Hokingly said they were understaffed

and why didn't LIRING/4 come back to help them out in the office. LIFING/4

told Rowton that she immediately showed interest but did everything sbe

could Iron appearing overenthusiastic. Ste commented to Rowton that one

must not run after such people, but make them dance a bit first so that

they would appreciate: anything they get. IIRIlG/4 continued that ske

replied to ibreu that

she would think it over, but in any case would not

want a repetition of the treatment she received last timte. All sorts of

assurances were given to her, but, despite this she made do commitment

since she wished to talk the offer over with LIRING/3 and kowton.

9. WIRING/* also reported that she had set the new consul, Earique

Cicard, and found hin rather pleasant. She said that she piarned to

invite him to dinner on evening soon so that LIIING/3 could chat with

bIn. LIRING/4 then commented that the only problem with Kara Cicard

could be Stall in the Press Office (as Rowton recalla) who was Cleara's

roomnate. She explained that Sarambu was a nember of the Corrunist Parüy

and appeared to be a toug" nut to crack. She surprised Routon by adding

that Cepede appeared easier to her, the only problem with him was how to

find an opening - some common interest she could exploit. Also regard

ing the part-tine work, she said that she did not take it too seriously,

since Aracell and Mirabal were coming back from levana and hence they

woald not bo so short-bandod. Rowton mentioned she micht also offer to

help the Mexican Rojas who had telephoned her recently. She agreed and

cormented that Rojas had told her that he had finally been invited into Ha

vana for a brief visit...

10. Rowtor then brought up the problem of LIRING/4's father. LIRING/4 con-

firned what LIRING/3 had told Rowton that vorning, i.e. that her father

had just announced that he had succeeded in obtaining the visitor's visa

from New Jork and that when she had telepkoned him suggesting they meet

In San Antonio (to avoid his appearing in Mexico Vity at this time), ber

father had balked, saying that if he were coming all the way to San An-

tonio be mught as well continue on a littie more and go to lezico City.

IIRING/4 explained to Rowton that she could not possibly get across to

ber father the real

reason she wanted to neet him in the U.s. (to avoid

arousing suspicions on the

aprt of such types as Cepeda) and she had to

let the matter drop. She added that there was also the problen of the

visa to the U.S. which she did not want in her passport. Roston offerred

to obtain the visa through business frieads in Houston ra:ber painlessly,

but LIRI G/4 insisted that this would be a needless rick in the eyes of

Copda just at a time when she night be recired. She concluded that the

only solution appeared to be kontreal where she could go without arousing

suspicion (sbe commented that Cepeda had told her that be intended to

visit Canada in the near future). She felt she could reduce some of the

expenss by traveling part way by bus. (hother tho ght that has occurred

to kowton is that she night travel via Havana, although he bas

not as yet

mentioned this to either LIRING/4 or WIRIRG/3).

11. During the meeting LIRING/4 presented Rowton with the "Acta Notorial"

which LIRING/3 had mentioned to Rowton that same morning. She said that

IIFING/3 had asked her to show the document to Rowton whiche he already

knew about. Roston took one of the thrce copies and told LIRING/4 that

he would study it at his leasure. The document is issued in apparently

proper legal form by Judge Rogelio Sanchez F., secretary of the Civil Court

of the Third Iribunal of the First Insteone of the Judicial Distrcit of

Monclava, Sabinas, Coshulla, and representa an aifidavit of Flias Piña

Diaz and Antonio Rodriguez Lozano to the effect that a certain Alberto

Zarate Vidal was born 7 September, 1929 in Ejido Puente Negro of Sabinas,

the son of forique Zarate Reyes and Bertha Vidal de Zárate, but that bis

birth was not previously registered by the parents. The witnesses, Piña

and Rodriguez, stated under oath that they knew this to be a fact from

personal knowledge of the parents. In the document Ilias Piña Diaz was

described as a Monican, married, native i abasole boat gumpioged rea-

dent of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Col. San Luisite 179, Coah. Antonio Rodri

guez Lozano is described as a "exican, widower, municipal employee, native

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

Forwarded herewith as Attachment One are five reports

prepared by lallace B. ROWTON on the LIRING-3

operation.

These

repurts are dated 13, 19, 22 (two reports) and 24 April 1967.

2. LIFEAT coverage of LIRING-3's apartment vas started on

6 April. A review of the LIFEAT take

for the period of 6

April indicated to ROWTON that LIRING-3 may not have been telling

him the truth on a number of minor points.

One of these was

rathor or not Rolantn !TOINS,

the Morgun tarado lamper who can

provide false birth certificates (on the basis of which Mexican

passports can later be obtained), exists.

ROWTON took up the question

of the lawyer and other points dealing with Enrique MORALES

and "GARCIA" with LIRING-3.

The latter appeared crushed that

ROWTON had doubts about the sincerity of some of his statements.

He swore that the lawyer really

exists and offered to give

ROWTON all pertinent details of his next meeting with "GARCIA"

can have a look at the Guatemalan "from a distance."

Such an arrangement should greatly simplity

LIENDRACE team,

"GARCIA" and LIRING meet.

LIRING-3 also admitted that his wife was becoming core and more

upset about his "clandestine" activities, and that his relations

with the Cubans were at a low point.

After his meeting with

RONTON on 19 April, when the above was discussed, the LIEMBRACE

team followed LIRING=3 from his old house (row used for his

meetings with ROWTON) directly to the Cuban Embassy.. LIRING-3

however,

and

later volunteered

the fact that he briefly visited the Enbassy to ROWTON, giving a

satisfactory explanation.

A review of the LIFENT take from 12 to 19 April showed

that LIRING-3 had deceived ROWTON on a couple of additional

points.

One of these

was that LIRING-3 called his Honduran friend

Rene OCHOA in Cuba,

when he told ROWTON that he phoned Arnol

RODRIGUEZ.

Faced with

the fact that the number he called was not

Arnol's (ROWTON pays LIRING-3's phone bills), LIRING-3 said that

OCHOA was the best friend he had in Cuba and

admitted that he

bad not been in contact with RODRIGUEZ for some time.

As can

be

seen from his reports, a major effort was made by ROWTON to

convince LIRING-3 and

especially his wife that the two should

take the initiative and make an effort to improve their relations

with the Cubans in general and the personnel of the local Cuban

Embassy in particular.

It became evident in the process that

his lack of good relations with the Cubans has been bothering

LIRING-3 and has been partly responsible for his depressed moods

upset his wife.

The latter is particularly

which, in turf the people in the Cuban Embassy for what she con-

disgusted with

siders

the poor treatment they

gave her husband prior to the

latter's last trio

to Cuba (Headquarters will recall that she was

fired at that time for telling off the Cuban Ambassador).

There is little question that ROWTON played his cards

well with LIRING-3 and especially his wife who agreed to reestablish

contact with the local Cubans to help RONTON and her husband.

can be seen from ROWTON's last report, the Cubans were quick to

seize the opportunity to develop better relations with LIRING 3'g

wife and, through her, LIRING-3.

The latter was having

lunch with

Ramiro Abreau Padron on 26 April as this dispate.: was being

He carried with him a letter of introduction written

rebels, to use LIRING-7 to vouch for LIRING-3 with Angelo

in dealing with LIRING 3.

The only points in the conversations with lorales not already known to

Rowton are references to a camera, which liorales, syparently at LIRING/3

request, looked at and checked the price ($600) in Sears Roebuck. and

to "Handbags" (Bolsas). These are probably items that üIkING/3 and

Morales are arranging to purchase in san Crlutóbal at loir cost and sell

in rexico City (IIKINC/3 mentioned this to Rowton at one podnt). Rowton

cannot. explain the refcrence to the carera, but thinks it may be for

to sorethino like the "Casa de las Americas" rather than a safenouse.

B) Conversation concerning the (valse) Birtace sificate: 1I.NG/3

naned Folando Ricias, recommonded ard intorauced to him by his hali-

brother, to obtain a birthcertificate with which he could apply for

a false rassport. This had been urged on hir or both ismail Sucres

de la Paz and Garcia himself to conceal travel into Cuba and Guate-

mala. IIRIiG/3 stated to Howton that he had seen instructed by fiojas

to appear at the Recistro Civile of lexico Üity and the birthcertifi-

cate would be civen to hia by an orficial iuertified to zim only by

number. _ IRING/3 adced that no name had as yet been detormined, since

it would be necessary for the lavyer to find an unused birtacertificate.

IIrING/3 reportea that the lawyer had demanded a 2,000 peso fee and

that, since he had only 500 pesos to space, his half-brother loaned

him 1,500 pesos en

che spot. IIIIG/3 asked Forton for this amount

on 7/4/5? so that ne could reimburse his half-brother, and tier on

secord thought, since it was a bit urgent, assed Rowton ninself to

cable the noney with the messale "I'a repayi:; the loar. Thank you".

There nay be decaption here inasmuch as in bis conversation with his

half-brother LInmic/3 stales "Don't pay any attention to the text,

which is 'I thai you for the loan'", lo reference is nade to a laryer

Rolando Riojas. Furthermore IIXINC/3 teils zis half-orother that

he went to Recistro Civil but the certificate had not as jet arrived.

He asks the two nimes of the parents. is bali-brother roplies civing

1. Rowton met with iI2ING/3 on 19 April, 9567, fron about 1810 until

1930 in the ratubaja apartuent. Roston case to the meetine prepared

to question ilulle/3 in deteil concernir: certain apparent discrepancies

2. During the first part of the moeting fo:ton persisted IInI:G/3 to

nake his usual report of developments since the last meeting. IIRIüG/3

stated

Five hin final instructions. It was agreed that IIRIC/3 ould reture to

Mezico vity on 22 or 23 April, 1937, and Sint Morales iould stand by in

San Cristobal until he received word fron :IXlG/3 by phone that he could

proceed on to Guatenala City to contact agelos Arvanisis. -IRING/3 esked

Roton's permission to give Morales 1,200 resos wiich are required on er-

tering Guaterala and which he could use co living expenses ior the

ten or

trelve day trip. joutos agreed that this sould be necessary and promisea

to let IJA01G/3 Iow of Arvanitis' SlA in Guatemala itty as soon as pos-

sicle, so that lorales would not have to waste time and morey starning bi

in San Cristsbal. Louton then gave LIRI: 313 the letter of introduction

to Arvanitis witten at bis request by IlinG/? the previous evening.

3. At this point Roston opened un with his questioning. lie prefaced his

remarks with a statement that he felt his experience over nary years had

•siven him a strong intuitive sense and accustoned him to looking carefully

at all angles of busan nature. He then staved that the affair of the birth

certificate (false) did not ring true for sone reason. ie staïed frankly

that he did not think that the lawyer Rolando kiojas existed and was in-

clined to believe that IIRING/3's half-brother invented this personage to

collect the fee of 2,000 pesos himself (despite the presence of a receipt

signed by Riojas). LIRING/3 appeared crusaed it this, commenting that what

that rowton could doubt his reliablity and even think

that he could act in any way dishonestly riuh regara to loxton. ile then

for both minaeli and LIntic/? for their ou arctaction.

4. Ro:ton then proceedsd to ancther matter that he stated vas bothering hia.

He explaired that neither he nor LIn: 0/3 iner almost notadug about Garcia

mid be ch wab saalute that same, con instance. a DSS arent working with

the Guadesalans. LI.: C/3 excluded this, but acroed that as much date on

Carcia nust be collected and/or elicited as poseible. He asked kowton

nether be had succeeded in finding Carcia's photograph erong the suspect

Guatemalans in the Sobernación roues' gallery ! Rowton had alleged tait he

had access to this brough crionds in Governacion, then torton replied that

he hai nos as get seen able to find ine right moment, Ilancis stated thet

such a central struet as dan juán de latrár shere there are street photo-

aiscourased this expisining that it would be transparent to Carcia, ard

adding that it was not in fact necessary. He soid that it would be suffi-

cient if be could it a loor it farcia at the next meeting so that he could

spot his roto without difficulty. 1 LunG/3 appeared relieved at this sug

• sestion and assured oution that he would arrange his next neeting in such

a way that Rowton could set = good look at Carcia.

5. Rowton then turned the spotlight on inrique iorales, conmenting that ne

did not believe the st-tement by Garcia that lorales was unritting of fiR

operations. IINIlG/3 again protested but added quickly that ic as prepared

7. Another confession LIRIN$/3 felt consüraired to make as that during bis

"excursions"

in Cuba arranged by the 282 on his last trip, he was aware

that every effort was being nade by the escorts to break him down physically

for sone reason not quite clear to hin as yet. He stated that during the

"escursions" he was not fives food or water (although both were consumed

by the escorts in nis

presence rather frequenily) and he iner that they

were waiting for him to ask forsuch necessities. He did not do so out of

stubbornness and rride, just to show the DiD tast he could "take it" when

requirea. IIRING/3 again explained that a strong sense of shame had pre-

on his trip to northern Mexico to find on outlet for the plastic flovers

to be purchased from l'etalonlástica de Cuatemala. IIVING/3 had called

Bouton's telephone ansvering service both from juevo loredo and from

his home shortly after his return to lexico on 6 April, 1907. (As usual

II: ING/3 used the assumed name Juarez in leaving the message).

2. IINING/3 stated that he had left lie:ico City by train on the evening

0? 31 Marcis, 1957, and arrived in Saltillo the folloring day. Le toch a

bus fron there to his destivation, Sabinas, and met his hali-brother at

his home. He reviened with his half-brother the problem of octaining a

jiuenou fiu dho Cechutralad of Connoras and Trasetry as Sittinod 49

kis by his friend Sergio Gonzalez liarin. His half-orother suggested that

trey both contact a close friond of his, a certain jercio Arche, in

Villa Acuña, ibo, he explained, workea as an electrical enzineer in the

local radio station and knew all the ins and outs of trade, both legal

end illegal, with the U.S. He then drove IIRING/3 to Villa icuña and they

continued their discussions in the presence of Arche. the latter finally

recommended that be set up a fictitious company at once in Del Rio, Texas,

that could issue a letter guaranteeing purchase of the complete pro

duction of the factory in Jan Cristóbal ( Plastiflor de San Cristóbal)

to satisiy the requirements of the Secretariat of Commerce and Industry.

Ee made it clear to iIRIlG/3 that be, with the help of LIRING/3's half-

brother, would really sell the flowers through legitimate companies in

both del Rio and ilouston, Texas, but this would take time and some bar-

faining. iccording to LIRING/3 all three agreed to the sussestion of

Arche and the latter proceeded immedistely to Del Rio to carry out his

plan. He returned the folloring day and reported that he had ithout

difficulty recistered the fictitioua copany, baptized "Floriex Co., in

Del kio by paying a snall (,20.00) fee, and at the same time obtained a

Fost Office Box (739) in the same city as the mailing address. 1IRII3/3

nore impressive and to provide for the letter forthe secretariat of con-

merce.

letter, since be trusted that Forton's command of inglish was better that

irche's, ard for this purpose bed broucht along with him a supply of

letterbead paper. He sided that de expected to received via irche any

future ennuiries concerning the Floriex Co. and would be able to reply

after consultation with Rowton. Atlached is a copy of toc final floriex

friend Serio Gonzalez liarin in order to proceed with the fornalities of

the license.

4. LIRING/3 then reported that he rissueced tita tie croucà anuüher

problem that had to be solved - the obtaining of a false passport wich

he explained be might beed for travel in Central ierica and Cuba. II-

RING/3 Inserved here parenthetically that ooth his half-brother and ser-

gio Arche were progressives and would not object io any insinuation that

his travel had political notives. His balf-brother, thom IIkING/3 des-

cribed as a "aan of action"

, irrediately sugcested that they consult a

lawyer friend of his in Nuevo Icrado who he was sure coula handle such

a problem. They then soth drove in uIRIlie/3's half-brother's car to

nuevo Loredo

and met sith the lauyer, si. Rolando 2iojas, who after some

discussion stated

that he coula provide IaRINg/3 wild a "valid" birth

certificate of a lexican born in northern Mexico, on the basis of which

LIRINC/3 could obtain a military service card and passport in lexico City.

He added that the "fee" would unfortunately be 2,000

pesos, since he would

bave to pay off a nuncer of persons in the vital statistics record office.

and obtained ü hand- riüten receipt. (On his return to Mexico, IIRING/3

cable the 1,500 pesos he had borrowed to his half-brother).

MEHORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT : Tape Recording of LIRING-3/ROWTON Meeting

REFERENCE: EDIA 31310, 8 Scptember 1967

27 March 1967

1. Subject tape consists of a 75-minute recording of

a meeting between Wallace B. ROWTON and LIRING-3 at the

LIRING3 safehouse on 20 January 1967 (this safehouse is now

no longer being used as such but rather is a residence for

LIFING-3 and his wife.

2. Following are facts extracted from a quick run

through of the tape:

a. LIRING-3 made a long distance telephone call

to kuby SUAREZ de Rodrasucz at telephone 30-67-04 in Havana, befal

He placed the call from the safehouse phone 14-18-56.

EHXKK* The call was made in

connection with a possible

forthcoming trip of LIRING-3 to Hevena. It was

developed

during the call that Ruby was the wife of Arnol Rodriguez

Camp!

and that their daughter was seriously ill. This information

regh

apparently was previously known to LIRING-3. who used the

Illness as a pretext for the call. Ruby had asked

LIRING-3 to obtain medicine for the daughter which was

LIRING - 3.

sent

201-798381

## Page 126

known

as NECCRAM. LIRING-3 advised Ruby that he was unable

to locate any medicine by this name and asked for the

laborAtary

formula dif the medicine or the name of the

label producing

1t.

During the conversation LIRING-3 said that he expected

trade

to be in

Havana within 15 to 20 days.

During this neeting

ROwTON set up a 5, 000 peas rushing fand

LIRING-3.

c. During the conversation the names

Navarrete

(Carlos) and Jacobo ere mentioned. It is believed that

there names referred to carlos Nonsente and Jeels Raestuct Palla,

artists and leftist friends of LIRING-3.

d. Another name was

mentioned, that of dax

SANTANA although themeing of the reference was unclear.

(Max Santand is

a well-known Cuban exile in Mexico City

who was formerly a labor leader in the pre-Castro era.

He is sonewhat of a lehistle

_ rascal and has to make

his living the best he can, but he is also the representative

of Carlos

PRIO, a former president of Cuba, in Nexico.

The CUIS has several times expressed interest in Max

SANTANA to double agents handled by the Station.)

e. An interesting item was dropped by LIRING-3

in connection with an alleged statement by Fidel Castro

that the young Mexican Communist Party members working

In Cuba were "algo burgues". The remark was interesting

in view of the strained relations

between PCM and PC.

secret

---

## Page 127

Secret

f. Another interesting remark dropped by LIRING-3

was that the Cuban leaders are highly unhappy "con el embagaon"!

This is interesting in light of independent reports we have

had that the Cuban Ambassador was anything but a happy man

when he returned a few days ago from his two month vacation

1n Cuba.

g. Several telephone calls occurred during the

course of the seeting or just afterwards. One of these

Involved an apparent inquiry by the person calling in as

to the name in which the phone was registered because

LIRING-3 said that the telephone was in the name of Naria

Sanch@z. Another telephone call of interest occured during

the meeting. It was apparently made by a young lady

calling in connection with an

anticipated meeting. with

LIRING-3. As the tape ran out LIRING-3

apparently was

waiting for the young lady's arrival.

promise of possibly producing inportant Information on

Cuban/Soviet subversion-support mechanisms operating in

This is particularly

There is a very real concern felt here about our involve

speculate on their motives for encouraging the creation

of the supply channel, we can be certain those notivea are

inimical to the interests of the United States.

So far it has not been posaible to confirm bIRING-3'a

contacts with the FAR or PGT in Guatemala or in Hexico,

the nature of his contacts with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico,

or with Cuban officials in Cuba.

We know that he bas

traveled to Guatemala, to Cuba, and has visited the Cuban

Embassy, but have only his word on what transpired after be

arrived.

at these places.

On the other hand, we bave confirmed

that he has withheld information from us, e.ß.,

the fact

that his wife worked in the Cuban Embassy and

father-in-law resides in the United States.

It is partially for this reason therefore, that

Headquarters is particularly anxious that LIRING 3'a

with "Garcia" should be confirmed and "Garcia"

"Garcia" is the FAR

representative iu Mexico

is in contact with the Soviets,.

thon 1a0rt1fging him

te an Important objective in itself,

apart from the establishment of LIRING 3'8 bonafides.

Given the difficulty of confiruing LIBING-3'g

sccounts of contacts inside Cuba, inside Guatemala, or

even inside the Cuban Embassy,

Headquarters sees the

LIRING-3 - Garcia contact, in the favorable operational

climate of Mexico City, as providing the opportunity to

obtain the confirmation which is so much needed in this

operation.

B.

appreciative as 1s Headquarters of the importance of

identifying Garcia, we wish by this dispatch to emphasize

the sense

of urgency which we consider proper for this

identification

ailort.

We urge that the Station cousider

survelllance of

the earliest possible meeting of which

it has sufficient advance knowledge to mount coverage.

It

is also suggested, siuce Garcia may travel to the Soviet

Union and this next neeting with LIRING 3 may be quite some

time in the future, that the Station explore all possible

Investigative means to identify Garcia which could be

Initlated without waiting for a surveillable meeting.

Possibilittes which have been discussed here include:

periodic surveillance of LIRING 3; LIFEAT and LINUD

coverage of LIRING 3; passage of photos of Guatemalang

who could possibly be Garcia to Rowton who, 1f a suitable

explanation for his possession of the photos could be

devised, could show them to LIRING3 for identification;

Including "Garcia" in a listing of aliases known

to be

used by

FAR members, and asking bIREBELl to identify

the user; or, obtaining a detailed phyalcal description

of Garcia for possible identification by LIREBEll,

Guatemala Station, or Guatemala Station assets.

false-flag

recruitment are appreciated by Headquarters and

Subject: Yonthly Report of Develogments

in LI-I:C/3 Cperation.

1. During the month kowton continued to meet with iIkINd/3 regularly,

on an average of three times per week, for about one hour, =: the safe-

house and (later in the month; at IInlhG/3's pernasent residence. LI-

RING/3 continued to accept Roston's guidance and diriction virtually

without obestion. Cr 15 February Poton prepared the draft of a project

outlining targets and objectives in order to soliäify lubaris's relation-

ship with iIRING/3. In order to facilitate financial arrangements with

LIRING/3 a revolving fund of 5,000 pesos was given to him by rowton to

be accounted for periodically against receipts.

2o bevejo bents milo respecü ic Guva:

During the reporting period IlRINGI3's relationship with the Cubans

deterioratedfor reasons not as yet

fully understood either by Roton

or LIRLiG/3 himself. It wiil be recalled that, following his passing

of sensitive information on the lopez arrest, LIRIiG/3 was invited

to lavana to discuss further collaboration.

Eis subsequent visit,

however, wag not as fruitful as exrected, despite the fact that he

finally net with Cienfuego, through the intervention of his friend

Arnol Rodriguez. In lieu of a specific nissicn for the Cubans, as

both Il IiG/3 and Rovton hoped, he was brushed off on an apparently

unimportant commercial assignment. LIKING/3 felt strongly that he

should establish relationsnips nitb the Guatemalan rebels on his

own ( torough Jacobo Rodriguez), more or less ignoring the Cubans,

and particularly the DSE, in the hore that the Cubans would inevi-

tably recognize the merit of his efforts and take him into their

confidence. At howton's urging, however, LInIiG/3 agreed to write

his friend Arnol Rodriguez a letter explaining nore fully his posi-

tion and inforning him that he was in any case moving ahead with this

plan to selp the Guatenala: rebels. This apparently did the trick,

since lodriquez rassed a message to him through the Cuban Ambassador

that he as invited back to lavana for further discussions. LINILG/3

expressed a treat deal of self-satisfiction at this development, but

felt be should continue with the FiR representatives in order to have

more concrete data to discuss with the Cubans when he did return to

Havana. He therefore returned to Guatemala in order to advise the

PAR ropresentatives that he had succeeied In obteining the medicine

and radio tubes they bad ori .ally asred for.

In February, however, he received word from irnol rodriguez throuzo

a diploatic courier that he should not return to Havana until be bad

received further Instructing from Arool Rodriguez himself. Subse-

quently, on 15 February, LIXING/3 learned from the chauffeur of the

Cuban Loassador that Julian Lopez had alleged taat LIRIIiC/3 bad o3-

tained the information regarding his arrest from the Mexican police,

and, by insinuation,

vas collaborating with the texican authorities.

The cueuffeur added that. LIAI G/3 should be aware that there were cer

tain elesents, including Cepeda, in the local imbassy hostile to bim.

This report led IIRING/3 to check with the Cuban Consulate re the

statuo so bio visa fauthorizo? in curio canual, lj irnol cuiriguero auù

to his surprise he learned that the visa had "run out" and would have

to be renewed in the event he desired to travel to Cuba again.

This devslopment left IIRIIS/3 perplexed and disturbed, as well as more

annoyed than ever with the bureaucratic shenanigans of the DSE. LIKiNG/3

felt genuinely outrsted since he in his own mind had only the best of

intentions in his offer to help the Cubans and in general the revolu-

tion in Sentral imerica. IIR:NG/3's first reaction was to ignore the

Cubans completely and proceed unilaterally with tis collaboration sith

the Guatemalans. He was encouraged in this by corments made by the

FAR contact in Mexico City to the uffect that the Cubang vere difficult

people to deal with and somntimes even FAR found it best to ignore then.

kowton, however, urged IINIiC/3 to redevelop more cordial relatiors

with the local mission, since any hostile elements there coula cause

him endless embarassment and annoyance. Rowton also advised LIRING/3

to continue his development of Ismail suarez de la Paz, who appears

to have a direct channel to irnol Rodriguez, and who himself has often

complained of the inefficiency and ineptness of the Cuban bureaucrats.

vuring the latter half of the month LIFJNG/3 made more frequent visits

to the mbassy and chatled cordially with abreu. As of 28 February, bow

ever, no further messuge has been received from irnol Rodriguez to

clarify LIRING/3'g current relationship with the Cubans.

Developeents with respect to Guatemala:

Durine the month LIxlNG/3's relaiionship with tir was strengthened by

direct contact with the FAR representative n Mexico City. Cn 13 rebruary

a Guatezalan telephoned IIPIlG/3 at iis residence and at the meeting

arranced for 20 February, idcutified himself is the lAR liaison ibo

would be seeing him nore or less reularly in the future. The FAR

liaisos, who stated his nine was Garcia, explained that he was plan-

nug a trip to the Soviet Urion in the near future, and was ansious

prior to his departure to have LIRllio/3 meet with three other comrades

preferably in San Cristobal when the redicine and radio tubes were

being delivered. IIRI:G/3 agreed to make the trip, since at the sere

time be could arrange the rental of a suitable nouse in the area for

future contacts. LIRING/3 therefore made plans to iepart with the

supplies for San Cristóbal on 1 liarch.

LIRING/3 had not informed the Cuban ambassy of his newly developed

liaison with FAR, but has indicate in a general way to irnol Rod-

riruez that he is engaged in support activities for the revolution in

Guatemala. He hopes to clarify vito the FiR more precisely what sis

own relationship with the Jubans should be with regard to their activi-

ties, especially in light of the fact that the fAk representative has

informed him that direct aid is now being received from the soviets and

certain of his activities are not being nade known to the Jubans.

In general in his dealings with the Cuatemalans, LIninG/s feels more

comfortable since his rclationship with them is uncomplicated at the

moment by such antecedents as the jopez affair. He is inpressed by the.

efficiency and professional approach of PAR and in undoubtedly. In.

fluenced by the relative ease with which he can roforn for them in

Mexico.

Cover ispects Of IINI:C/3's Unerations:

Дріії

?

During the month of february, LIRING/3 presented s formal request to

the Dirreción General de Comercio torough his friend Sergio Gonzalez

Pandere Cal à5

mhre1s%.- Marin for the establishnent of a sall fuctory to asierble the plastic

flowers produced by the Metaloplastica de Guaterala. In anticipation

of a request by the Secretariat for details and assurances that the

flowers will be exported to the U.S. and not compete with local pro-

Who

duction, IIRI G/3 re-established contact with his half-brother who

lives in Sabenas and has excullent connurcial contacts with firms in

San Antonio, in the hope of sollloiting his help in finding an American!

importer who will contract to purchase the entire pooduction of the

factory once it is set up in lexico. At the same time LIRING/3, on

Rowton's suggestion, will investigate the possibility of establishing

---

## Page 158

a modest factory in the house he plans to rent in San Uristóbal.

Negotiations with local

authorities in that area would be much simpler

than in lexico üity and at the same time the factory would provide

excellent cover for the sufehouse.

If and when the flower project materializes, arrangements can easily

be made by IIRING/7 to have the first shigment sent from Guatcuala

City by truck to San Cristóbal. A qualified l'exican can likenise be

sent to learn the technical details of assembly at the retuloplastica

plant in Guetenala City.

The entire commercial cover plan has been accepted enthusiastically by

FAR since it presents to them the inviting prospect of a viable legal

network operating from exas to Guatemala City. LixiNG/3 reazizes the

delicacy of the future relationship with retaloplastica and IIRING/7

and has jirioci ic coiurtaont as nuch se pnesible. at least for the

present, his activities on benalf of FiR from those of a purely com-

mercial nautare.

3.. During the month it was necessary for IIRING/3 to nove his funily itio

the safehouse, which he had rented in bis orn name, in order to disabuse

the landlady of her crowing suspicions that the apartment was being used

for some unorthodox purpose. IINING/3 explained to the landlady that be

had been having some domestic problems vith his iife, but that things had

been patched up and that tbey were now able to resume their married life

together. This has apparently satisfied the curiosity of the landlady.

Anotber safchouse, under cover of an art studio, will ve located for fu-

ture meetings between iIRINC/3 and Rowton. The oricinal plan to noritor

the safehouse from the apartment below has been abandoned in view of the

undesirubility if the couple currently residing in the proposed IP.

LIRING/ 3 - Norris K. UTHLETT Chronology

Carlos JURADO Delmar, a Nexican artist and existentialist,

is an unwitting ifformant who has Mexican far leftist political

convictions.. He has been assessed by his handler as unfriendly to

the U.S. and not a candidate for recruitsent. JURADO's wife, Miriam

CHICHAY, a Chinese-Cuban, worked in the Cuban Embassy in l'exico City

until November 1966 for LIPING/1 and LIRING/2. RONTON /retends to

be a Greak businessnan interested in developiling lucrative, semi-legal

husiness with Cuba. JRAND may have the impression that prime is

really somehow connected with Soviet intelligence - a notion ROTTON

lotties.

has not attempted to disabna

He has convinced JURADO

that to be successful the two of them mist be fully avare of all the

realities of Cuban politics and commerce. JURADO, who lived in Cuba

for a couple of years following CASTRO's accession, has maintainod

friendships with some well-placed contacts in Cuba. He has made

three trips to Havana in connection with his relationships with

RONTON, Who obtains information from JRADO by eliciting and direct

questioning.

As 'à result of the injection of UTADO by Station Mexico

City into the sensational JULIAN LOPEZ Diaz/Guatemalan Arms Suggling

case, JURADO was asked by the Cuban Embassy to help the GOC with their

sensitive astivitées in Mexico and to go to llavana for

a briefing

on shat he cAuld do. To inject JURADO into the case, Station Mexico

City furnished him with some theretofore undisclosed information on

## Page 189

the arrest by ''exican authorities of LOPEZ Diab, a Cuban diplomat, Thi

jeralles

• allegedly esses from a Cuatemalan reporter who had obtained it fros

a member of the Guatemalan Communist party. In Havana, JRADO

discussed the case at length with his friend and contact, Arnol

RODRIGUEZ Camps, a forner Vice-Vinister in the cuban Foreign Ministry.

He also told RODRIGUEZ details of a plan to form his l'exican and

Central American contacts into a network which could support clandestined

abate, Cuban operations. RODRIGUEZ appeared to be impressed, according

tO JURADO's story, and introduced JURADO to Osmani CIENFLECOS, Chairran

of the Foreign Affairs Conmittee of the Central Carmittee of the Cuban

Carmunist Party (the body charged with the responsibility for

impianenting Cuban subversion in latin morier.).

rupan romarted

that CIENFUECOS expressed appreciation for JRADO's offer of assistance and

stated that Cuba is interested in exporting subversion to Central

America to harass the thited States. I

CIENFUEGOS reportedly went on to say that the libanstrustral JURADO

but not his contacts about whon they knoir nothing. He further.

explained that one untrustvorthy link could blow the entire effortt

and and then suggested that JIPADO be given the opportinity to test the

sincerity of his contects. RODRIGUEZ reportedly suggested that

JURADO arrange a deal to barter Cuban Nickel ore for weed killer.

(Cuban Nickel ore is already being offered in Nexico by other dealers and

Nexican-made weed killer is readily available

on the open market

in Mexico) •

## Page 190

Despite Headquarters suggestions that JURADO go slowly in setting

up his support net to the Guatemalan guerrillas, Eas RONTON sett him

to establish contact isiut with them on the !lerican/Guatemalan border

in early December 1966. JURADO established contact with a mah in

Mexico City who gave him a letter ci introduction to a woman in (uatemala

City. The wonan was to carry the letter to Cesar MONTES, Guatenalan

guerrilla leader and explain thut he could wif trust JURADO and should

take advantage of his offer. At the same time JURADO sent a letter to

RODRIGUEZ in lavana explaining that he boald not nake his comercial

contact witting of any arms passed through the proposed channel.

lie also sent innomation on weed jiliors and roquestéd details

for possibly consumating the deal.

In mid-December JURADO again traveled to a town on the

Mexicana side of the Guatemalan border and contacted the guerrilla

representatives. le reported that he was taken "black" across the

border to Cuatemala City where the guerrillas told him of some of

their problems in obtaining material, specifically & mentioning their

need for

some radio tubes and mecical supplies. JURADO cormitted

himself to providing those items along with a concrete proposal for

regular contact. The guerrillas reportedly told JURADO that they

could handle the goods from the Mexican side of the border to their base

camp in Guatemala.

At this point the 'exico City Station proposed to mount a

paralles operation involving Norris K.UMILETT, a 33 year old Greek

who was recruited in 1952 by ECYTON to penetrate the U.S., Creek, and

Cuban Communist Parties. UPHLETT perfoemed adequately inthese tasks

PONTON sent IMPHLITT to quatemala in late February 1966 on a

"Business development" trip to estahlish contact with 'elements who

an EDA deputy in Athens. U'MILETT is to exploit this relationship

in an effort to land a job in the husiness as a cover to assist the

Creek in clandestine activity.

In nid-January 1967 JURADO reported that the Cuban Arrassador had

called him aside at a party to teil hin that RoRICE? cabled the

Embassy to request JRADO's presence in Cuba for additional discussions.

Rather than jump on Havana's cormand, JURADO called RODRICEZ tO

infom him he would have to make another trip to Cuatemala first.

JURADO reported that he was approached by another Cuatemala Commist

iho claimed, in confidence, that he was part of the FAR netork

in Mexico and had been advised that massive Soriet aid (in excess

of: $200,000) was available to the FAR "directly" but with qualifications

that would in effect place the FAR under complete Soviet cortrol. He

explained that it was for this reason that the FAR was raising funds

on its own by such neans as bank and train rotheries, in Central America,

At the end of Janumay JPADO reported he had made contact

with the FAR representatives in ruatemala City and had rade arrangements

for permanent liaison in 'lexico City and Havana. He was given contact

instructiors, which would ho initiated by the FAR repsesentatives, and was told

matt to passthe suppleis (that he had comitted hinself to

providing) to the contact man in 'exico City.

A special enoy from Cuba visited JURADO the day after he

returned from Guatenala for the ostensible purpose of passing on

some advise and guidance of a security nature. RO:TN speculated that the

Cubans - particularly RODRICUEZ - were afraad JURADO had taken offense

at their treatment of him on his last ixited visit to Auha, and sent

someone to salve his feelings. The envoy gave JURADO a lot of advice on how

to handle himself with respect to the Cuban Embassy personnel,

American intelligence, and on security and tracecraft in general.

On 15 February lIEDRERA, the Cuban Embassy chauffeur anda

friend of JUFADD, met with the agent to tell him some rumors he

had heard involving JURADO including the statement that there were

certain "hostile elements" toward JURADO in the Embassy. RETON

cautioned JURADO not to be too aloof with the Embassy causing them

to react unfavorabley toard him for no reason fiter its than

that they were out of touch with him.

On 20 February "Carcia" the FAR representative in lexicg,

set up a beeting with JADO but agred that RAms plan to taken pianend in

City because of "zhe incredible network of agents run by the Vorth

Americars throughout the city." He said that the FAR didn't have an

urgent need for the supplies because they were adequately suppleed

by the Soviets and Cubans but that the FAP. had no objections to

JURADO dealing with Yon Sosa's 5-13 Noverker which is not so well

supplied. "Garcia" said he tias scheduled to travel to the soviet

Union and wanted to discuss fall the aspects of Jaila support

operation so that aftivies could move ahead in his absence. "Carcia"

contrasted the "bother" of dealing with the Cubans with the seethiece of

relations with the Soviets.

On 2 March JURADO traveled tothe Mexico/Guatemala border

part of

town of San Cristobal to deliver/the on supplies to the representatives

of the FAR guerrillas. "Garcia" showed up and he and JURADO went

to a than nearet-the Guatemalan border where. they transferred the

goods, "Garcia" said he would take possession of the refrigerated

drugs in 'exico City after returing from the USSR. The FAR rep-

resentatives explained they had a fairly godi setwork in Texas for.

the acquisition of as but were having trouble transporting them.

They indicated JURADO's plan was better than arything they have going

and would probably acopt it. Before he left for ISSR, "Garcia"

called JRADO to tell him that Cesar MONTES and Yon SOSA had patched

up their differences and the Guatemalan guerrilal movement could move ahead

faster now.

AXLYSIS AND COgENTS

INTENT OF TIE OPERATION: To provide inforantion: * Cuatemalan

insurgency; Cuban - and perhaps - Soviet support of subversion

in Guatenala; the use of Mexico by the Cubans and Soviets

to support Guatemalan insurgency; identify people, pin-point

locations, and estahlish metliods of operation of insurgents

and their support nteworks in fuatemala and Mexico.

i. ESTABLISIMENT OF SUPPLY NETORK - PATON is having

LIRING/3 establish a supply network in l'exico and fuaichala to pass

materiel to the insurgents in fuatemala. The supplies could

originate in either the U.S., Cu:a, or by sea from any countrie

In doing this, members of existing support networks are not being

idertified - only the aliases of some of LIRIlf/3's contacts.

This network could tery well operate parallel to other such channels

and he would not learn any nore than we are learning now. In fact,

we could conceivably assist fuatemalan insurgency and get little

or nothing in rethrn -- and should the operation go aury this agency

would be hard put toexplain the circunstances. You can be sure the

leftists would have a field day.

We are not adverse to providing

some material as long as we get something in return.

## Page 195

20. ¿IRING/3'8 REPORTINE - None of the ifformation LIRINF/3

has reported has been corroborated by other sources. Only the

existence and presence of some of the contacts has been coffirmed by

technical operations at the Station, but not the infomation. So

far we, and RONTON, have no choice but to beléeve most of what

LIRING/3 tells us. /forrov's capability in the Spanish language is

only adequate and one taped meeting showed that LIRIN/3 spole right

ovor ROMON and dominated the conversation. / It is conceivable that

LIRING/3 is controlling the entrie operation and that PAtION

is not able to discern this. Also, because of the unusual nature of

their relationship and Ramuse ever pro is not able to question

LIRING/3 too deeply in some areas and not at all in others. And

we are assuming that ROWTON's cover is effective.

art: this

may nee

orrectio

3. SURVEILLANCT: - The LIRING/3 operation has been going

for over a year now and the only surveillance of the agent has been

an abortive attempt at tapping his telephone and an audio device

in the safehouse in which he. and his wife are now living. His phone

should be tapped constantly, his mail should be intercepted and read, he

should be survéilled for a couple of weeks to establish his pattern

of activities, photographs should be taken of him and his contacts,

and he should be investigated to find out where his money comes

from, where it goes, what his wife does all day, etc.

14-00000

4. SUMARY - After a ye, the operation is oot paying off

as it should and the agency and ROWTON

are cormitted to a situation

that could hackfire in

several ways, Steps should be taken soon to confirm

LIRINC/3's access and information and to establish beyond the

shadow of a douht his bona fide. Headquarters is not at all convinced

that 1) LIRIN^/3 believes ROTON's cover story, 2)

That LTRINC/3

is in contact wilith the FAR, 3)

that the opposition is not playing

WOTACT for a sucker.
