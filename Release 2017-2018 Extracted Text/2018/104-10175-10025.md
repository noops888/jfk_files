1. The Station feels that perhaps we understated the degree
of concealment as outlined In reference B. It Is ayreed that a
sophisticated technical search would probably find the device we
planted but al! personnel at the Station involved with this operation

‘ egreed that such a search wes most unlikely. The case officer

dealing directly with LIRING?3 also minimized the possibility of
LIRING*3 meking any kind of a search. All of these points were
considered before making the Installation.

2. At the moment, we do not feel there is enauoh reason to
jusctity the ris«s invoiveo in anotiier surreptitious entry. We
will however remaln alert and be prepared to take corrective action.

the Period 19-26 April,19€7.

1. In reviewing the traffic for the period indicated Rowton found

valuable confirmation of LIRING/3 and LIRING/4 contact with Ramizs teeter
Abreu, indicating that both persons complied with. Rowton's suggezsions. :
LIRING/3'a telephonic contacts. with Enrique Morales in Guatemate City ;
confirmed reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the eve=t.

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 is a dinner engeze-

ment which Enrique Morales had in Guatemala City on 25/4/67 with "friends"

of Morales' wife, Zsperanze. SAN-10 (47.5) also reveals that L :
‘nd Morales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of purses
or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatemala or San Cristébal for resale
in Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIRIES,
mentioned the opportunities in this line to Rowton previously, <3 Row-
ton did not react favorably). i

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of the take
which will serve to clarify them iu relationship to reports made to him
vy LIRING/3 and LIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Ramiro Abreu: On 22/4/67, shortly aftaz 2owton
suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect tarovgh
him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephczed the
Embassy and attmmpted to reach Abreu. From. the content and tone ef her
Questions and remarks, it appears obvious thet 11. ‘4 has net had re-

Havana, but is given no information. She tries sgain at abozt 1900 and
2000, but there is no answer. She finally cets through to Abrew on
44-13-26 who promises to come to her home between 1CO0O and 1700 the
following day (23/4/67). She has to give Abreu the address, indicating <
that hé is not fawiliar with the home addzess of LINING/3 orf%.

SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that Abreu called or talked to ESEIG/4&

t on the telephone three times on 24/4/67, LIRNG/4 makes referezce to
al "so much analysis,so many theories and ideas" which apparentiy vere dis-
i

in substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet had a chance
to talk directly with LIRING/S to get her version of the conversations
with Abreu. Apparently in order to put Abreu off (in bis amopous de~
signa) LIRING/4 tedle him on 25/4/67 that her husband suspects that
sorething is going on between them. In roply to Abreu's anxious ques~
tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husband asked her whether she liked
Abreu and whether Abreu like her, to which she said that she replied in
the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off
without alicnating him). Abreu's visit to the ppartment ond his pro-
posd luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confimmed by the latter in his
report to Rowton on 27/4/67.

Conversations Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) IIRING/3 asks
his Guatemalan friend (Jacobo icdriguez Padilla?) whethor it matters if
the Hirth cortificate ts for a person 10 years older? Jacobo replied
in the ‘negative, but would prefer it of a person ten years younger.LI-
RING/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his possession by
25-26/4/67. This is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state-
ment made to him some two weeks previously that when he went to pick up
the (false) birth certizicate at Registro Civil on instructions of his
half-brother (and the lawyer Rolendo Riojas) he discoveréd that it was
for a person born in 1916 and hence useless for bimself. LIKING/3 also
reported to Rowton that Jacobo had contacted bim recently and asked for
help in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation

“therefore vould indicate thet LIRING/3 plans to sive Jacobo the false

document originally procured Zor himself through his half-brother. LI-
RING/3, however, has not revealed this plan to Rowton.

SAN-11 (16.0) reveals that LIAING/3 informed his brother two days later
that he bas spent over ten days at Registro Civil but it 4s “impossible
to get the birth certificate. The book no longer exigsts." He adds that
he hes written his half-brother a letter explaining everything. LIRING/3
reporsed to Rowton that he had asked his half-brother to obtain an
"acta notorial" in lieu of brita certificate and hoped to have the doca-

ment soon.

* TDY REFORT FOR
Joscpa 4. RESCIGKO
11-20 May 1967

Site: Mexico City, Mexico
Dates: 11-20 May 1967

Objective: The purpose of the trip by RESCIGNO was to
provide support to the station on two priority audio
operations (set up the LIRING/3 LP and the LIRUSTIC/1
installation). This support was provided in addition
to the TDY support being rendered by Reginald 3S. JEMHON
a Feplacement for CORNBURY who wes on sick leave.

Chronology:

RESCIGNO departed Kational Airport for Mexico City
via American Airlincs at 0800, 11 May 1€67 and arrived
Ain Mexico City at 1400, 11 May 1967 (all times local).
After checking into the Palace Hotel, R. reported to
the Station by telephone. Station contact was made
through SLINKARD who advised R. to come into the Station.
R. discussed relative target priorities and then met
with the respective case officers concerned with the
operations. The rest of the day was spent checking out
equipment for possible use on the LIRUSTIC/1 operation.
The following dey was spent planning and becoming familiar
with the LIRUSTIC/1 operational situntion, infiltrating
equipment into the base/LP and setting up a cover story.

No operational work was planned for the above
operation for the weekend; therefore, the LIRING/3 LP
equipsient was checked out and the LP equipment set up
in the LP on Saturday. The equipment used was a T+204
Revere Recorder (110 VAC, 50 cycle) and an SPR-2A
carrier current receiver. The occupant of the LP was
briefed in the operation of the equipment. There was
ho conversation in the LP during the briefing; consequently,
R. planned to return the following week to determine :
relative reference levels of nll control settings to
assist the LP operator in making his recordings, Entry
into the target to inspect the installation was not
vonsidered operationnlly possible over the weekend and
the case officer made plans with the LP operator for @ y
meeting later in the week.

Monday through Thursday of the following week was
devoted to the LIRUSTIC/2 installztion which is the
subject cf a separate report.

RESCIGKO purchased 2 telephore locally to be used
ass replacenent for 9 cefective instrument in the LP
for the DMARGO operation. The existing telephone
extension was malfunctioning aud would ring only inter-
mittently. Since the LP had some extra telephone cnbiea
terminating at the house, the case officer did not want
to request a normal telephone company service call,

Thursday evening, 18 May 1967, was scheduled for
testing the two installations that were completed on
the LISAMPAN operation; however, tpon reporting the
successful installation io the LIZUSTIC/1 target,
RESCIGNO was informed that the telephone company was to
be working th: 44etesbution box where the loop
connections were to be nade. Consequently, the testing
of the installetions was postponed until the telephone
company personnel complete their work in the aren.

On Friday morning, the LISING/3 LP was again
visited to check the operation of the equipment and
to establish relative reference levels for the operator
to obtain cptimum results. The target was occupied and
a recording vas made of a telephone cal. and a discussion
with a book salcaman, The operation of the equipment
wos satisfactory, The technical details of the target
installation were thoroughly reviewed in consideration
of the operational situation. The case officer was
pletely satisfied that the type of installation was
ae: dtely adequate {zon 2 security standpoint in this
particular situation. The target equipment was
functioning normally with no technical problems; there-
fore, a re-entry into the target was not considered
necessary, CORNBURY expressed a similar view when the
operation was discussed vith him that afternoon.

‘The page-boy systen was discussed with the Station
and RESCIGNO was informed that tests had been made and
4t was decided to install a higher gain antenna to
reach outlying areas. The Station plans to put the
system into operation as soon as tha antenna is received
and installed.

The LP for the LIRUSTIC/1 installation was set up
on Friday on the trip frou the Station to the airport.
CORNBURY returned to the Station on Friday afternoon

----- at 1430, RESCIGNO departed the same evening at 1800

because he was unable to obtain reservations for the
return trip on Saturday or Sunday. This was caused by
the holiday rush and RESCIGNO had been requested to be
available at Hendquarters tke next week for another
Operation where his participation had been tentatively
@iscussed,

RESCIGNO arrived in Washingtcn on Saturday,
20 May 1967, at 1000.

sine Bet tine 4 hay 1967 i
Subject: Monthly Report of Developments in the LIRING/3 Operation,
for the Period 1-30 April,1967.

1. During the month of April, Rowton was able, through valuable leads
furnished by LIFZAT intercepta, to put strong pressure on LIRING/3 to
present acceptable proof of a number of statements that he had made to
Rowton. At his meeting with LIRING/3 on 19 April, Rowton confronted LI-
RING/3 with suspicions be entertained concerning the proposed acquisi-
tion of a false birth certificate as well as the identity of "Garcia",
the FAR representative. The session, which lasted over two hours, shook
LIRING/3 s0 much emotionally that LIRING/4 became alarmed and telephoned
Rowton's answering service the following morning. Rowton was able to ex~
ploit this opportunity to talk privetely with LIRING/4 end to lay the
foundation for an independent working relationship with her against tar-
gets of interest in the local mission.

2. In addition to initiating a positive effort to verify LIRING/3's bona
fides and reliability, Rowton's confrontation paved the way toward a
closer and more productive relationship with hin in the future. LIRING/3
assured Rowton taat he considered bis work for Rowton the most important
thing in hie life and was willing to do anything to prove that his in-
tnetions were honorable and his reporting reliable. As a result Rowten is
currently in a position to challenge any or all of LIRING/3's statements,
end to give him much more specific direction than was possible in the
port | Pareensisiens

3. The following are Rowton's comments on specific developments during the
month in summary form:

a) Developments with respect to Cuba: On 19 April, LIFSAL intercept

-| SAN-7(9.0) revealed that both LIRING/3' and LIRING/4 were virtually

Art

Asolated from the Cubans. In the conversation with the Mexican Rojas
LIRING/3 stated that "he and his wife no longer have anything to do
with those people", and LIRING/4,° in conversation with the same perscn,
added that she "feels like vomiting when she sees thea". Both LIRING/3
and /4 admitted this situation to Rowton on 22 April when he talked to
each privately, LIRING/& explained her dislike for the Cuban employees
of the mission originated in the "rude manner in which she was thrown
out into the street" some six months previously. LIRING/3 confessed,

Vo HMMA 31423 GS copy


aay
.

2,
that he could not expkain why his close friends Arnol Rodriguez and
: René Cchoa had not commusicated with him over the past month,despite
‘ his messages and telephone calls. He felt an uneasy suspicion that the
.- Julian Lopez affair, as well as the Rico Gal4n letter, had caused certain
elements locally and in Havana to become hostile toward him, LininG/3
noted that Cepeda had been present when LIRING/4 had blown her top in
the Ambassador's office and that he (LIRING/3) had turned down Cepeda's
invitation to accompany hin to Havana shortly after the return of Julian
Lopez. In any case LIRING/3 agreed that the best, or, more candidly, the
only course of action open to him was to play a waiting game and continue
his work with the Guatemalans in the hope that the Cubans, sooner or later
would recontact him. He stressed that only after he has established firm
end viable cover through the plastic flower business will he be able to
face a thorough interrogation by the DSE in Eavana (which he expects,
should he return at this time). He feels that he has max enouch Greeks
to dete ( Econonou, Frevolis,Batsakis, Gasdaglis,Arvanitis) in both Mexico
City and Guatenala City, to justify his relationship with Rowton on a
purely commercial level, should that become necessary.
LIRLNG/3 accepted. Rowton's recommendation that LIRING/4 overcome her
apparent visceral dislike for the Cubans in the mission and effect a re-
conciliation 4 them as soon as possible. After Rowton's personal appeal
to her, she succeeded in recontacting Ramiro Abreu on 22 April, and re=
mained in almost daily contact with him until he left Mexico on 30 April.
Through Abreu sae re-established contact wite Curbelo, Cepeda, and other
= employees of the Consulate, inciuding Enrique Cicard. This gave LIRING/3
an opportunity to chat with Abreu concerning his own situation with the
result that Abreu promised to get some word out to LIRIKG/3 concerning
the attitude of bis friends in Havana. Abreu invited LIRING/3 back to
Havena, but the latter turned this down diplomatically (for the reasons’
mentioned above).

: et b) Developments with Respect to Guatemela: The identity of "Garcia",
y the FAR represestative, has continued to occupy the attention of Rowton.

v An attempt by the Station team to surveilt Garcia when he allegedly picked

: MA ° up the medicine from LIRING/3 on 28 March was unsuccessful ( Rowton spottec

Wy LIRING/3 leaving bis house at about 0815,just as the team was taking posi-
tions and before they could identify LIRING/3), Another opportunity to

surveil LIRING/3 ‘Garciajas well as Enrique “orales, was lost on the even-

-dng of 8 April, becasue of the short notice Rowton has of the mecting.



ats oe ou: a
Matters, however, have been simplified after the confrontation of LIRING/3
by Rgwton on 22 April, inasmuch as LIRING/3 promised to notify Rowton in
advance of the next meeting with Gercia, explicitly for the purpose of
Rowten's getting a look at Garcia to identify hin. In addition on 1 May,
LIRIKG/3, inforned Rowton that Garcia had telephoned him the preceding day
to set a date for their next meeting on 18 Kay, when Garcia stated he
would be back from Guatemala. LIFiaT take for 30 April should confirm or
refute this statement.
During the month LIRING/3 maintained contact with Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla
Alicia Echeverrfa as well as Carnen Carrasco. LIFEAT intercepts confinmed
LIRING/3 reports, at least as far as actual contact was concerned.

c) Developments with Respect to the False Birth Certificate: Uppn his re-
turn from northern Mexico on 6 April, LIKING/3 reported that he hed made

q arrangements to obtain a false birte certificate for future use through
: bis half-brother and a certain lawyer named Zolando Riojas(for a 2,000
quaed Rowton's auspicions concerning the

te 2

role, if any,played by Riojas, and served es e bxasis for Rowton's heart-
to-heart talk with LIRING/3 on 22 April, LIR1G/3 clained that the false
birth certificete produced by bis half-brother and Riojas was not suitable
since it applied to a person born in 1916. This appears to have been the
tnuth, as indicated in LIRING/3's conversatica with Jacobo Rodriguez Pa-
: - dilla on 23 April (SAN-10(2.5), although Row’ still has doubts concern-
i aang the existence and role played by Rolando xiojas. Likewise, LIRING/3's
i report that his half-brother was to provide bia with an affidavit in lieu
i of birth certificate in the name of Alberto Zérate Vidal,(a name chosen
by LIRING/3 himself), was proved to be teve woen LIRING/4 gave Rgwton the
originalax of the court papers on 29 April.

d)_Cover Aspects of the LIRING/3 Coeration:

LIRING/3 traveled to northern Mexico (Sabines,ituevo Loredo) ‘and Del Rio, os
Texas, and, in collaboration with his half-brother ‘and a certain Sergio
NX Arche of Villa Acufis, establisheé a notional company ("Floriex") in Del
Rio as a buyer for the plastic flowers assembled in San Cristébal. This

 SHnBer Bett : 4 Hay 1967

Subject: Wallace B. Roston Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton met with LIKING/3 at the safehouse(Tacubeya} briefly at we)
4000 on 1 May ,1967~ LIRING/3 reported that "Garcia" bec telephoned at
him on the preceding day to tell biz that *he had to sake another trip}
this time to Guatemala ané that he would be returning on 18 May 51967.
LIRING/3 added that Garcia indicated that he would see LIRING/3 on that
date or a few days thercefter, and planned to introduce him to a

friend who would be ina position to see him nore frequently in the
future. LIRING/3 told Rowton he. again mentioned the payment for the
medicines and Garcia assured him that it would be settled at their

next meeting.

2, LIRING/3 also reported thet Abreu departed on 30 April, rather than
on 29 April,es anticipates. He said thet he had therefore had achance to
meet wita Alceu again, The latter exconraged bim to keep in touch with
jim and promised to get some sort of message to LEYRISG/3 from Arnol
Rodriguez and/or Cienfuego. Accordicg to LIRING/3 sbreu asked bin whether
he would be willing to visi his friends in “avana agein in the near
future to discuss his situation personally, indicating that be would
arrange for an invitation as soon 8s he returned. IIRING/3 told Rowton
he thenked Abreu but stated thet at the moment he was very busy with his
conmertiel obligations end could not find the time. Fe gesured Abreu that

. ag soon as he got things rolling in San Gristébal and Guatemala, he

would welcome the chance to visit Havana again.

3. LIRING/3 then stated that he and LIRING/4 had talked over the matter

of her father's visit at Length, end hed also talked again to him by tele-
ptione(}n response to his two cails),and hed come +o the conclusion that

4t was more practical that LIRING/4's father come to Mexico City after all,
since a trip to Montreal was too costly and it appeared impossible to con~
vince LIRING/4's father that he should not come to visit his daughter at
her howe. LIRING/3 added that be planned to have LIRING/4 take per father
on as tiany excursions 83 possible outside Mexico City to keep his visit

-as quiet as possible. He said that in any event lIRING/4's father could

not make. the trip before 20 Nay, 1967, when hés vacation would begin.

4, LIRENG/3 then menticsed that both he and LIRING/& felt that they should
return to the Tacubaya apartment to live. He explained that LIRING/4 bed
originally moved into tue former safehouse at his request to satisfy the


curiosity of the landlady, sra. Sanchez. He felt that this had already
been accomplished and. sna Sanchez was not likely to ask eny further
questions. Also both he and LIRIEG/4 were worried about suspicions that
night be aroused on the part of tne local Embassy “and Consular staff if
they continued to reside there. Abreu had already raised his eyebrows
slightly and appeared satisfied wiva LIRING/3's explenation tnat he had
rented the apartment for some friends who were out of the country tempor-
arily. LIRING/4 is not comfortable in the apartment, especially since she
may have to face her fcrzer colleagues frequently is she resumes her work
in the Consulete. According to LIRI#G/3, she feels they are better off
in relatively modest surroundings,since they have fewer questicns to ans-
wer and explanations to give. Their old apartment (tacubaya) also has
two separate bedrooms and would be more convenient when her Father comes
to visit tuem, LIRING/3 stated that he could, of course, cogtinue to

suse the Atoyac apartment to see Rowton and meet discreetly wits bis con-

tacts, as previously. hb

5. In view of the above, Rowton suggested that LIRING/3 infors tis friends,
particularly the Cubans, that the stoyac apartment had been rented for

his Greek friends from Guatemala and Venezuela who planned to establish

a plastics factory here in iiemico and needed a place to stay during their
visits. LIRING/3 felt this would be acceptable, since by now he had good
working contects with Batsakis and Gasdaglis in Guatemala City ard would
soon be seeing swvanitis and possibly others. Rowton also suggested that
if it became necessary to explain his contacts with the Greeks to the Gu-
bans, he should say that his original contact was with Pandelis Economou
re the importa:icn of Metaxas cognac (this is true) and that he had met
Stylianos Prevolis and continued to work through him oa the recommendation
of Economou (when the-latter returned to Athens). i

6. LIRING/3 stated thut he planned to revisit his friends in the Secreta-
riat of Comserce (particularly a sefior Llamas of the Plastics Committee)
to obtain the import license for the first shipment of disassenbled

flowers to San Cristébal. f :

‘Wallace B. Rowton
P.S. LIRING/3 also gave: Rowton the attached data on Mrique Norales
and his wife. Ue indicated that Esperanza Morales knows havarrette
as well as Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla because of her work at the Museum.

tee 7 _ : 29 April,1967
"subject: Wallece 3. Rowton Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton met with LIRING/3 at the safehouse at 1800 on 27 April,
and at 0845 on 29 April,1967. At the first meeting LIRING/3 gave
Rowton the new letterhead paper of the Plastifor de San Cristébal
company and report::i that he had been in telephonic contact with
Enrique HKorales in Guatemala City end has passed on to him Rowton's
message instructing him,(as per LIRING/?'s suggestion) to contact
Mr. Constantinos Gasdeglis of the Metaloplastica Guatemalteca to be
shown through the factory and given some unassembled smaples of the
plastic flowers. This had been suggested by LIRING/7 inasmuch as Mr.
Angelo Arvanitis had not arrived in Guatenala City from Caracas as
anticipated.

2. At both meetings LIRING/3 revorted almost daily contact with Ramiro
Abreu either pessonally or by phone. He stated that he had had a private
talk wita Abreu, in which the latter attempted to smoot over the ap-
parent difficulties liming/3 was having with the Cubans, by stating that
nobody really had anything against LIRING/3. When the latter showed his
dissatisfaction with such a brush-off, Abreu mumbled sozethibg about

the Julian Lopez affair and added that there were “certain things he

Was not in a position te discuss", Abreu insinutated that Cepeda was
more or less hostile. although he himself did not share Cepeda's atti-
tude. At this point LIRING/3 inserted the comment that when LIRING/4
blew up some six months aga(on the day that she was fired) in the Am-
bassador's office, Cepeda was present, and he appereatly resented the
action even more than the Ambassador. LIXING/3 agreed with Rowton that

_ in light of the current situetion the best course. of action would be to

give LIRING/4 a chance to re-establish cordial reletions with her forner

collesgues, particularly Cepeda, since she had the advantage of being a
Cuben and former employee herself.

3. with regard to other comments made by Abreu, LIRING/3 stated that he

“definitely felt that Abreu was naking a pitch for direct and continuing

contact with him, even after Abreu returied to Havana. LIRING/3. stated
to Rowton that he gently brushed this off, stating to Abreu that he hed
certain underétandings with Arcol Rodriguez and Samani Cienfuego and for
that reason did not feel free to enter into any operational relatioship.
with anyone else. He concluded this discussion with a comment that if
Abreu could somehow get a message to bim from either Arnol Rodriguez or



ae.

Cienfuego designating Abreu as their liaison, LIxING/3 would be glad to
accommodate, LIRING/3 added to Howton that he gave Abreu a sketchy idea
of what he was doing in establishing commercial ties with both Guatezala
and Texas, Abreu appeared intensely interested and when LIRING/3 showed
him the letterhead of the new"conpany" in San Cristébel, Abreu snapped
up the paper and envelope and. slipped ttém into his pocket. LIRING/3 told
Rowton that he expressed to Abreu his intention cf continuing hie efforts
along the commercial lines, regardless of the leck of enthusiaam shown to
him by the Cubans.

4, At the 29 April zeeting LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that @arique Horales
had returned safely from Guatemala City, after having met with Constantine
Gasdaglis and obtained from him samples of the flowers. Since Rowton had
almost reached the.conclusion that LISING/3 has known Enrique Morales for
several yeers (contrary to his story thet he met bim through "Garcia" )How=
ton threw in at this point the comment that ne aad veen coeds
rales,through a Mexican Dunn and Bradstreet type firm he uses ih. business,
and found that Morales has a poor dredit rating, is married, and is an
artist by profession ( actual source of this info is LIFEAT intercepts).
LIKING/3 appeared surprised at the accuracy of Rovton's report and adaitteé
that Morales was a painter, although he did not earn enough from his work
to live. LIRING/3 elso stated that Morales had used the 500 pesos payzent
he had made to him to liquidate an overdue loan at a bank, but that he was
currently out of debt and in good credit standing.

ing ou iio

5. At the same meeting LIRING/3 reported that he had been in touch with
his half-brother regarding the false birthcertificate and informed his
half-brother that the one presented to him was for a man born in 1916 and
hence useless for his own mx purposes. According to LIRING/3, his pother
proposed an even better idea, the procurement of an “acta notorial" in
which it would state that the person named therein had never been regis-.
tered. LIRING/3 pointed out that this would be more valid legally even
then a birthcertificate since it would be issued by a court rather than
simply by the Rigistro Civil. He then added that he might f ortunately
Rill two birds with one stone, but using the affidavit in lieu of birth
certificate for himseif and give the fals birthcertificate to his friend
Jacobo (Rodriguez Radilla) who had asked bim to help procure a false docu~
ment. Rowton agreed that this would be the best eolution and ask when LI-
RING/3 hoped to have the papers. He replied that his half-brother had al-
ready sent the acta notorial on the morning bus from Sabinas (Coah.) and”



i fae 3.

that he was to pick it up from the bus driver early that same afternoon.

6. LIRING/3 then reported to Rowton that the Consulexe had asked LIRDIG/4
to come back to work on a part-time basis. According to 1IRING/3, bota
he and LIRING/4 dragged their feet on any connitment until they could re-
fer the matter to Rowton. LIRING/3 commented thet the thought of LIRING/4
being again in euch close contact with such types did not make bim happy.
but he agreed with Xowton that this perhaps would serve to re-establisa
his own relationship with then. LIRING/3 eazitted that it had been very
convenient to have LIRING/4 inside the estedlishment, especially since
ahe could pick up messages for him and keep her ear to the ground and her
eyes open for gossip. 2owton replied that im view of this development he
felt that té should have another private chat with LIRING/4 and asked LI-
RING/3 to inform her that he would be calling on her that afternoon at
about 1700, LIRING/3 discreetly stated thet he planned to be out at that
time in any case seeing bis chisdren (oy Sis ex-wiley.

7. Rowton spent some 90 minutes with LIRING/4 at her home that afternnon.
She reported thet she had made out much better then expected with Abreu,
who came running when she telephoned bin shortly after Rowton left her on
the evening of 22 April. She added that be came to the house that evering
in the cozpamy of Curbelo auf nade a date to see her againthe next morning.
She commented that Abreu, who had always had a sort of crush on her, was
delighted and pleasantly surprised by her. initiative. iie confessed that

he thought LIRING/4 wanted a visa to go beck home, and was relieved to
find that she was sot in any difficulty. iG/4, in her typical candid
manner, sdzitted that abreu's interest in ber was probably personal, but
she felt that she had accomplished what Rowton wanted in her own feminine
way. Rowton congratualted her and asked her to continue her efforts,parti-~
cularly with Cepeda and the others in the mission.

8. LIRING/& then explained that on her wisit to the Eubassy, Abreu, in the
presence of Cepeda and others, almost Yokingly said they were understaffed
and why didn't LIRING/& come back to help them out in the office. LIRING/4&
told Rowton that she immediately showed interest put did everything she
could fron appearing overenthusiastic. Ste commented to Rowton that one
must not run after such people, but make them cance a bit first so that
thay would appreciate: anything they get. LIRING/4& continued that she
replied to Abreu that she would think it over, but in any case would not
want a repetition of the treatment she received last timte- All sorts of



ee ite he \

assurances were given to her, but,despite this she made ao commitment
since she wished to talk the offer over with LIRING/3 and Howton.

9, LIRING/% also reported that she hed net the new consul, Enrique ,
Cicard, and found him rather pleasant. She said that she plenned to
invite him to dinner on evening soon so that LIKING/3 could chat with
him. LI: EL then commented that the only problem with EIZIM Cicard
would be Sesesei in the Phess Office (as Zowton recalls) who was Cicard's
roommate. She explained that Sarambu was a member of the Cotmunist Party
and appeared to be a tougs nut to crack. She surprised Rowton by adding
that Cepeda appeared easier to her, the only problem with him was how to
find an opening - some common interest she could exploit. Also regard-
ing the pert-tine work, she said that she did not take it too seriousiy,
since Araceli and Mirabal were coming back from Hsvana and hence they
would net be os s! a, Rowton mentioned she might also offer to
help the Mexican Rojas who hed telephoned her recently. She agreed and
commented that Rojas had told her that he had finally been invited into ia-
vana for a brief visit.

40. Rowtor then brought up the problem of LIRING/4's father. LIRING/4 con-
firmea whet LIRING/3 had told Rowton that morning, i.e. that her father
had just announced thet he had succeeded in obtaining the visitor's visa
from New York and that when she had telerkoned him suggesting they meet
in San‘ Antonio (to avoid his appearing in Hexico City at this time),her
father had balked, saying that if he were coming all the way to San An-
tonio he mught as well continue on @ little more and go to itexico City.
LIRING/4 explained to Rowton that she could not possibly ges across to
her father the real reason she wanted to meet him in the U.S. (to avoid
arousing suspiciéns on the aprt of such types as Cepeda) and she had to
let the matter drop. She added that there was also the problem of the
wisa to the U.S. which she did not want in her passport. Kowton offerred
to obtain the visa through business friends in Houston re-be> painlessly,
but LIRI G/# insisted that this would be a needless risk in the eyes of
Cepda just at a time when she might be resired. She concluced that the
only solution appeared to be Montreal where she could go without arousing
suspicion (she commented that Cepeda hed told her that he intended to
visit Caneda in the near future). She felt she could reduce ‘some of the
expenss by traveling part way by bus. (Another thought that has occurred

- to Rowton is that she might travel via Ravana,alth: e has pt as yet
mentioned this to either LIRING/4 or LIRING/3).



: 5.

41. During the meeting LIRING/4 presented Rowton with the "Acta Notorial"
which LIRING/3 hed mentioned to Rowton thet same morning. She said thet .
LIRING/3 had asked her to show the document to Rowtcn whiche he already
krew about. Royton took one of the three copies and told LIRING/4 that

he would study it at his leasure. The document is assued in apparently
proper legal form by Judge Rogelio Sanchez F.,Secretary of the Civil Court
of the Third Tribunal of the First Instecne of the Judicial Distrcit of
Monclava, Sabinas, Coshuila, and representa an affidavit of Elias Pifle
Diaz and Antonio Rodriguez Lozano to the effect that a certain Alberto
Zarate Videl was born 7 September,1929 in Ljido Puente Negro of Sabinas,
the son of Enrique Zarate Reyes and Bertha Vidal de Z&rate, but that his
birth was not previously registered by the parents. The witnesses, Pifia
ané Rodriguez, stated under oath that they knew this to. be a fact from
personal knowledge of the parents. In the document Zlias Pifia Diaz was
escrived as &
dent of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Col.Sen Luisité 179,Coah. Antonio Rodri~
guez Lozano is described as a itexican, widower,municipal euployee,native
cr Buenaventura,Coah.,resident of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Celle Dos Ge
Abril CK-825. Attached herewith is a copy of the affidavit for station
and Headquarters files.

Reference + HMMA-231721, 3 April 1967

Headquarters notes in reference that the method of
concealuent used in bugging LIRING-3's apartment, i.e,
accomodating the SPT-2A in a hole below the wall outlet box
and taping the microphone to the outlet itself, is

2 ty the tin view af the
lack of sophistication of the target personalities. We
are somewhat surprised by this since we had thought that one
of the reasons for waking the installation was to determine
just how sopiisticated and reliable LIRING-3 and company
were, that is, whether or not LIRING-2 might be working for
the opposition. This point might not have come through
clearly in H!MW¥-15227, 20 March 1967, and if 80, we would
like to take this opportunity to emphasize that one of the
reasons we have been following this involved case so closely
is to guard ayaiust the possibility that LIRING-3 is more
sophisticated than is apparent on the surface (or is himself
being handled by a sophisticated opposition case officer).
If so, we obviously cannot afford to assume that reference
installation is adequate since it would appear to be quite
easily discoverabie by superficial exaaination by someone
with some degree of sophistication and a screwdriver and
flashlight. The Station acted correctly in MEXICO CITY 0881
in describing and seeking approval for the installation, and
we must confess that it just never occurred to us that LIRING-3
et. al. might be considered to lack sophistication in this
regard. We would therefore welcome further Station comments

KAPOK/PBRUMEN - The LIRING@3 | Operation

TETION REQUPED REFERENCES

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachzent One are five reports
prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON on the LIRING-3 operation. These
reports are dated 13, 19, 22 (two reports) and 24 April 1967.

2, LIFEAT coverage of LIRING-3's apartment was started on
6 April. A review of the LIFEAT take for the period of 6 to 12
April indicated to ROWTON that LIRING-3 may not have been telling
him the truth on a number of minor points, One of these was

or not Bolende NLOTAS, the Lareda lawyer who can

provide false birta certificates (on the basis of vhich Mexican
passports can later be obtained), exists. ROWTON took up the questipa
of the lawyer and other points dealing with Enrique MORALES
and "GARCIA" with LIRING-3. The latter appeared crushed that
ROWTON. had doubts about the sincerity of some of his statements.
He swore that the lawyer really exists and offerce to give
ROWTON all pertinent details of his next meeting with "GARCIA”
so that ROWION can have a look at the Guatemalan "from a distance.”
Such an arrangement should greatly sinplify the ta&of the
LIEMBRACE team, the next timc "GARCIA" and LIRING-3 meet.
LIRING-3 also admitted that his wife was becoming tore and more
upset about his "clandestine" activities, and that his relations
with the Cubans were at a low point. After his meeting with
ROWTON on 19 April, when the above was discussed, the LIENBRACE.
team followed LIRING=3 from his old house (now used for his
meetings with ROWION) directly to the Cuban Embassy. LIRING-3

only stayed there about five minutes, however, and later volunteered
the fact that he briefly visited the Embassy to ROWTON, giving a
satisfactory explanation. : :
3. A review of the LIFEAT take fron 12 to 19 April showed
that LIRING-3 had deceived RO#TON on a couple of additional
points. One of these was that LIRING-3 called his Honduran friend
Rene OCHOA in Cuba, when he told ROWTON that he phoned Arnol
RODRIGUEZ. Faced with the fact that the number he called was not
Arnal's (ROWTON pays LIRING-3's phone bills), LIRING-3 said that
OCHOA was the best friend he had in Cuba and admitted that he
had not been in contact with RODRIGUEZ for some time. As can be
seen from hig reports, a major effort was made by ROWTON to
convince LIRING-3 and especially his wife that the two should
take the initiative and make an effort to improve their relations
with the Cubans in general and the personnel of the local Cuban
Embassy in particular. It became evident in the process that
his lack of good relations with the Cubans has been bothering
LIRING-3 and has been partly responsible for his depressed moods
which, in turn, upset his wife. The latter is particularly
disgusted with the people in the Cuban Embassy for what she con~
siders the poor treatment they gave her husband prior to the
latter's last trin to Cuba (Headquarters will recall that she was
fired at that time for telling otf the Cuban Ambassador).

4. There is little question that ROWTON played his cards
well with LIRING-3 and especially his wife who agreed to reestablish
contact with the local Cubans to help ROWION and her husband. As
can be seen from ROWION's last report, the Cubans were quick to
seize the opportunity to develop better relations, with LIRING-3's
wife and, through her, LIRING-3. ‘The latter was aaving lunch with
Ramiro Abregu Padron on 26 April as this dispatci: was being
written. i

5. Enrique MORALES, meanwhile, is in Guatemala to receive

instruction in the art of making plastic flowers from Angelo :
ARVANITIS. He carried with him a letter of introduction written
by LIRING-7, It was necessary to clinch the plastic flower deal
which will serve to cover LIRING-3's activities with the Guatemalan
rebels, to use LIRING-7 to vouch for LIRING-3 with Angelo
ARVANITIS, ROWTON has been instructed, however, not to bring
LIRING-3 and LIRING~7 together and to pass LIRING-7 off simply
as a friend in the Embassy of the nationality which ROWTON uses
in dealing§ with LIRING-3.

6. Forwarded As Attachment Two, under separate cover, is
a photocopy of a document from the Mexican Secretariat of
Gobernacion notifying LIRING-3's wife that the visa application
for her father, now in the United States, has been denied. This
is not too surprising in view of the father's current nationality
and racial background,

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment {| are the following
reports written by Wallace B,. ROWTON:

A. Report dated 7 April 1967 describes the trip which L-3
made to Northern Mexco to explore the possibility of obtaining
a US customer for L-3's planned plastic.flower business. All
L-3 needed was a letter from a potential US customer, real or
Ficticious to obtain a license for his business from the Mexican
secretariat Gi vumerce and inaustry., For 4 yZd.ue fee a friend
of L-3's half brother registered a firm in Del Rio, Texas.
This firm would, on paper at least, import L-3's flowers into
the United States.

Mexican lawyer, Rolando RLOJAS, in Nuevo Laredo "valid" birth
certificates can be! purchased with which Mexican ‘passports can
be obtained. L-3 who wants another passport to travel to Centra!
America (his own tears PBRUMEN entry and exit stamps) immediately
“ordered” a birth certificate.

C. Report dated 8 April gives more details on the men
L-3 was introduced to by his half-brother, who certainly
seems to know his way around tha U.S, Mexican border area.
Station had no treces on SH or Eloy %GONZALEZ,

D. Report dated 12 April covars meetings: with "GARCIA"
of, the FAR and Enrique MORALES Guerra recently introduced
to L=3 by GARCIA to help\him with the plastic flower business.
The Station did not have kufficient advance notice to have
GARCIA and MORALES surveilled. In connection with paragraph
5 of that report dealing with Alicia ECHEVARRIA, ROWTON has

been trying to have L-3 meet Alicia to use her with the PBRUMENers

as a "source" for some items of information passed L=3 by
ROWTON. Ali » who drinks like a fish and is frequently
under the weather, seems to have a difficult time remembering
what she tells people.

E.
ECHEVARRIA, GARCIA and Jacobo ¥RODR'GUEZ Padilla, RODRIGUEZ's
comments on the relations betwéen t:'z FAR and the Yon Sosa
guerrilla groups in Guatemala were cabled separately. The
Station is examining the desirability of having L-3 obtain a
birth certificate for RODRIGUEZ (via the lawyer in Nuevo Laredo)
with which the latter could obtain a Mexican passport,

Report dated 13 April ise: meétings with Alicia

F, The same report contains a detailed description of
"GARCIA" and a sketch of him drawn by L=3. The Station is
currently exploring via LIREBEL the possibility that "GARCIA"
may be identical with fnu CASASOLA, known to LIREBEL as the
new PGT representative in Mexico City.

2, Forwarded as Attachment Two, under separate cover, is the
text of the letter (later typed on "Floriex Co,“' letterhead) which
L-3 intends to present to the Mexican authorities to obtain a
license for his plastic Flower business.

. Headquarters traces on Rolando RIOJAS, Sergio ARCHE and
Eloy GONZALEZ would be appreciated, Station traces vere negative.
This Station would also appreciate knowing Headquarter's interest
in the Mexican birth certificate - passport mill discovered by

He made it clear to LIRING/3 that he, with the help of LIRING/3's half-
brother, would really sell the flowers throuzh legitimate companies in
both del Rio and Houston, Texas, but this would take time and some bar-
gaining. According to LIRING/3 all three agreed to the suggestion of
arche and the latter proceeded immedictely to Del Rio to carry out his
plan. He returned the following day and reported that he had without

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD °7 March 1967

SUBJECT : Tape Recording of LIRING-3/ROWTON Meeting

REFERENCE: HMMA 31310, 8 Scptember 1967

“1. Subject tape consists of a 75-minute recording of
a meeting between Wallace B. ROWTON and LIRING-3 at the
LIRING-3 safehouse on 20 January 1967 (this safehouse is now
no longer being used as such but rather as a residence for

LIFING-3 and his wife).

2. Following are facts extracted from a quick run

through of the tape: :
a. LIRING-3 sade a long distance telephone call
to ub} suaREZ de Rodrpgucz at telephone 30-67-04 in Havana. bf ff
He placed the call from the safehouse phone 14-18-56.
BHEXKK The call was made in connection with a possible
te beralomnalr,

forthcoming trip of LIRING-3 +e—Hevena, It was developed
during the call that Ruby was the wife of Arnol Rodrgguez Compt
and that their daughter was seriously ill. This information fig,
apparently was previously known to LIRING-3 who used the Qe
illness as a pretext for the call. Ruby had asked Bent.

LIRING-3 to obtain medicine for the daughter which was

yen an

emt yr



~ Sead a

known as NECCRAM. LIRING-3 advised Ruby that he was unable :
to locate any medicine by this name and asked for the Bee
fornula uf the medicine or the name of ene ET ‘producing
it. During the conversation LIRING-3 said that he expected
to be tn tebeel’ within 15 to 20 days, During this meeting
ROWTON set up a 5,000 peges tersbnens fut with
LIRING-3.
ce. During the conversation the names Nawarrete
(Carlos) and Jacobe were mentioned. It is believed that

these nanes referred to (Carlos Homamute ani eere Rapartuce bble

articts and Yeftist (riends of LIRING-3.
: d. Another name was mentioned, that of Max
SANTANA although themesaing of the reference was unclear.
“(Max Santang is a well-known Cuban exile in Mexico City
who was formerly a labor leader in the pre-Castro era.
He-is somewhat of a Light rascal and has to make
his living the best he can, but he is also the representative
of Carlos PRIO, a former president of Cuba, in Mexico.
The CUIS has several times expressed interest in Max
SANTANA, to double agents handled by the Station.)
e. An interesting item was dropped by LIRING-3
in connection with an alleged statement by Fidel Castro
that the young Mexican Communist Party members working
in Cuba were “algo burgues”. The remark was interesting

in view of the strained relations between PCM and PC,

keuf



: 2 eat

es : f, Another interesting remark dropped by !IRING-3

was that the Cuban leaders are highly unhappy "con el embai

This is interesting in light of independent reports we have
had that the Cuban Ambassador was anything but a happy man
when. he returned a few days ago from his two month vacation
in Cuba,

8. Several telephone calls occurred during the
course of the meeting or just afterwards. One of these
involved an apparent inquiry by the person calling in as
to the name in which the phone was registered because
LIRING-3 said that the telephone was in the name of Waria
Sanch@z. Another telephone call of interest occured during
the meeting. It was apparently made by a young lady
calling in connection with an anticipated meeting. with
LIRING-3. As the tape ran out LIRING-3 apparently was

waiting for the young lady's arrival.

1. ‘The LINING-3- operation, because of its scope,
davolving information bearing on Cuba, Mexico, Guateuala,
and now possibly the Soviet Union, and because of its
promise of possibly producing important iniormation on
Cuban/Soviet subversion-support mechanisms operating in
and through Mexico, has naturally been closely followed
by All Headquarters components concerned with these
areas,

2, Because of the recent developments in the
opera:ion:, auu beCHuse Od bie impowiauey od Lhe Lavget,
Headquarters “is anxiovs to establish, as precisely as
possible and aa goon 2s possible, a basis for judging
LIRING-3's reliability and access, This is particularly
important in view of the apparently rapid progress
LIRING-3 is making in creating a channel for the movement
of arms and supplies from the United States to Guatemala,
There is a very real concern felt here about our involve-
went in the creation of this channel while we have not yet
clearly established how we could control it. We do not
wish to find ourselves in the position of having aided tie
guerrillas to receive cven a small amount of weapons or
supplies. And we must guard against the possibility that
the CUIS has not been taken in, and that it is monitoring
this entire operation. If this is true, while we can only

'

speculate on their motives for encouraging the ereation
of the supply channel, we can be certain those uotives are
inimical to the interests of the United States.

3. So far it bas not been possible to confirm LIRING-3's
contacts with the FAR or PGT in Guatemala or in Hexico,
the nature of his contacts with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico,
or with Cuban officials in Cuba. We know that he bas
traveled to Guatemala, to Cuba, and has visited the Cuban
Embassy, but have only his word on what transpired after he
arrived. at these places. On the other hand, we have confirmed
that he has withheld information from us, e.g., the fact
that his wife worked in the Cuban Embassy and that his
father-in-law resides in the United States.

4. Yt is partially for this reason therefore, that
Headquarters is particularly anxious that LIRING-3's
contact with "Garcia" should be confirmed and "Garcia"
identified. Algo, of course, if "Garcia" is the FAR
representative in Mexico and is in contact with the Soviets,
thon fying Mr ta an imvortant objective in itself,

apart from the establishment of LIRING-3's: bonafides.

5. Given the difficulty of confirming LIRING-3's
accounts of contacts inside Cuba, inside Guatemala, or
even inside the Cuban Embassy, Headquarters sees the
LIRING-3 - Garcia contact, in the favorable operational
climate of Mexico City, as providing the opportunity to
obtain the confirmation which is so much needed in this
operation.

6. While it is understood that Station is as
appreciative as is Headquarters of the importance of
identifying Garcia, we wish by this dispatch to emphasize
the sense of urgency which we consider proper for this
identification eifort. He ge that the Station consider
surveillance of the earliest possible meeting of which
it has sufficient advance knowledge to mount coverage. It
is also suggested, stuce Garcia may travel to the Soviet
Union and this next meeting with LIRING-3 may be quite some
time in the future, that the Station explore: all possible
investigative means to identify Garcia which could be
initiated without waiting for a surveillable meeting.
Possibilities which have been discussed here include:
periodic surveillance of LIRING-3; LIFEAT. and LIMUD
coverage of LIRING-3; passage ot photos of Guatemalans

. who could possibly be Garcia to Rowton who, if & suitable
explanation tor his possession of the photos could be sot
devised, could show them to LIRING-3 for identification;
including "Garcia" in a listing of aliases known to be
used by FAR members, and asking LIREDEL-1 to identify
the user; or, obtaining a detaiied physical description
of Garcia for possible identification by LIREBEL-1,
Guatemala Station, or Guatemala Station assets.

7. The special difficultics inherent in a falee-flag
recruitment are appreciated by lcadquarters and it is

understood that in many situations only the case officer
himself can determine how far and how fast he can go

in pressing the agent for information or details on’ any

above suggestions to be not feasible or may be able

to suggest other investigative means which would offer
greater prospects for success, Headquarters, of course,

Subject: Monthly Report of Develomnents ie LIn1:3/3 Cperaticn.

1, During the month kowton continucd to meet with iIMING/3 regulerly,

on an avererse of three times per week,for about cae hour, s+ the safe-
house and (leter in the month) at 1 /3's permasent residence. LI-
RING/3 continued to accept Rowton's cuidsnce and cirsction virtually.
without ofestion, Cx 15 February “ovton prepared the draft of a project
outlining targets and objectives in order to solidify Kuberk's relation-
ship with LIRING/3. In order to facilitate financial arrengements with
LIRING/3 a revolvinz fund of 5,0CO pesos was given to him by Rowton to
be uccounted for periodically against receipts.

2. bevelornents Wilh resvecé Lo Cuba:

During the reporting period i1XINGs/3's reletionsnip with the Cubans
deterioratedfor reasons not as yet fully understood either by Rowton
or LIRING/3 himself. It wiil de recalled that,following his passing
of sensitive information on the Lopez arrest, LIRING/3 was invited
to iixvena to discuss further collaboration. Eis subsequent visit,
however, was not as fruitfyl 2s expected, despite the fact that he
finally net with Cienfuegos throush the intervention of bis friend
Arnol Rodriguez. In lieu of a specific nissicn for the Cubans, as
both Ll /3 and Rowton hoped, he was brushed off on an apparently
unimportant conzercial assiznment. LIKING/3 felt strongly that he
should establish relationships wita the Guatemalan rebels on his

own ( tarough Jacobo Rodri:uez), more or less ignoring the Cubans,
“and particularly the D3E, in the hope that the Cubans would inevi-
tably recognize the merit of his efforts and take him into’ their
conficence. At Kowton's urging, however, LIKING/3 agreed to write
bis friend Arnol Rodriguez a letter explaining more fully his posi-
tion ant informing him that he was in any case moving ahead with xhis
plan‘te aelp the Guatemalan revels, This apparently did the trick,
since Rodriguez passed e nessage to him through the Cuban Ambussador
that he was invited back to Savana for further discussions. L1aTsG/3
expressed a great deal of self-satisfuction at this development, but
felt he should continue with the FAR representatives in order to have
more conerete data to discuss with the Cubans when he did return to
Havana. He tticrefore returned to Guatemala in order to advise the

ath. /h Pinna 314 ea cs cor Jo1- 79GFSZ0l

; = 2.

FAR representatives tat he had succeeéed in obtzining the medicine
and radio tubes they had ori-isally asxed for.

In Februery, however, he received word from arnol Rodriguez throuca

a diplozatic courier that he should not return to Havana until he had
received further instructicns from Arncl Rodriguez himself. Subse-
quently, on 15 February, iG/3 learned from the chauffeur of the
Cuban Arbassador that Julien Lopez had alleged t LIRING/3 had ob-
tained the information regarding his arrest fror. the Mexican police,
and, by insinuation, as collaborating with the hexican authorities.
The cheuffour added that 1Ii1.G/3 should be aware that there were cer-
tain elexents, including Ceveda, in the local unbassy hostile to him.
This report’ led LIRING/3 to check with the Cubszn Consulate re the

2 in early Cumuary Ly Aruol <
to his surprise he learned that the visa had "run out" and would have

to be renewed in the event he desired to travel to Cuba again.

This dev2lopment left LIXING/3 perplexed and disturbed, as well as more
annoyed than ever with the bureaucratic shenanigens of the DSS. LIniNG/3
felt genuinely outrQyed since he in his own mind had only the best of
intentions in his offer to help the Cubans and in general the revolu-
tion in Central America, IIX.NG/3's first reacticn was to ignore the
Cubans cozpletely and proceed unilaterclly with tis collaboration sith
the Guatesalans. lie was encouraged in this by cerments made by the

FAR contact in Mexico Cit
people to deal with and sometimes even FAR found it best to ignore them.
kowton, however, urged LIXI:G/3 to redevelop more cordial relations
with the lecal mission, si any hostile elements there could cause
him endless embarassment and annoyance. Rowton also advised LIRING/3

to continue his developdment of Ismail Suarez de la Paz, who appears

to have a direct channel to Arnol Rodriguez, and who himself has often
complained of the inefficiency ond ineptness of the Cuban bureaucrats.
buring the latter half of the month L1ZiUG/3 made more frequent visits
to the Zabassy and chatted cordially with Abreu. as of 25 February,bow~
ever, no further mess:ye has been received from .rnol Rodriguez to
clarify LIXING/3's current relationship with the Cubans.

y to the effect that Subans were difficult

Developrents with respect to Guatemale:

During the month LIKING/3's relavionship with FAR was strengthened by
direct contact with the FAR representative n Mexico City. Cn 13 February



a : as ch im

a Guatezalan telephoned LIRilii/3 at ais residence ond at the neeting
arranged for 20 Feoruary, idcitified himself as the AR liaison who
would be seeing him-more or less re‘ularly in the future. The FAR
liaison, who stated his name was Garcia, explained that he was plan-
ning @ trip to the Soviet Urion in the near future, end was anzious
prior to his departure to have LIRING/3 meet with three other comrades
prefersdly in San Cristéoal when the 1edicine and radio tubes were
being; delivered. LIRING/3 asreed to make the trip, since at the sexe
time he could arranje the rental of a suitable aouse in the area for
future contacts. LIRING/3 therefore nade plans to depart with the
supplies for San Cristébal on 1 March. :

LIRING/3 had not informed the Cuban Snbassy of his newly developed
liaison with FAR, but has indicateu in a general way to zrnol Rod-
riguez taat ne is engaged in support activities for the revoluticn in
Guatemala. He hopes to clarify with the FAR more precisely what cis
own relationship th the dubans should be with recard to their activi-
ties, especially in light of the fact that the Fax representative has
informed him that direct aid is now being received from the Soviets and
certain of bis activities are not being made known to the Gubans. ee
In general in his dealinss «ith the Cuatemalans, LINIUG/2 feels more
ship with them is uncomplicated at ‘the

comfortable since his relati
moment dy such antecedents as the Lopez affair. He is impressed by. the.
efficiency and professional approach of FAR and in undoubtedly in-.
fluenced by the relative ease with ch he can vepforn for them in

Mexico.
Cover Aspects of LIRING/3's Operations: i

During the moath of February, LIRING/3 presented a formal request to
the Dirrecién General de Comercio tarough his friend Sergio Gonzélez
Marin for the establishment of a stall fuctor¥ to assemble the plastic
flowers produced by the Metaloplastica de Guatemala. in anticipation

of a request by the Secretariat for details and assurances that the
flowers will be exported to the U.S, and not compete with local pro- A
duction, LIRI.G/3 re-established contact with his _half-brether who :
lives in Sabenas and has excellent conmercial contacts with firms in |

\ San Antonio, in the hope of solliciting his help in finding an American:

importer who will contract to purchase the entire pooduction of the
factory once it is set-up in Kexico. At the seme tine LIRING/3, on
Rowton's suggestion, will investigate the possibility of establishing


setts ae
a’modest factory in the house he plans to rent in San Cristéval.
Negotiations with local authorities in that area would be such simpler
than in Mexico City and at the same time the factory would provide
excellent cover for the safehouse.
If and when the flower project materializes, arrangements can easily
be made by LIAING/7 to have the first shizment sent from Guatenala
City by truck to San cristébal. A qualified Nexican can likewise be
sent to learn the technical cetails of assembly at the Ketaloplastica ~

plant in Guetemale City.
The entire commercial cover plan has been accepted enthusiastically by
PAR since it presents to them the iuv: ospect of a viable legal
network operating from Texas to Guatemala City. L G/3 reslizes the
delicacy of the future relationsnip with Netaloplestica and LIRING/7

Total. LIRING-3 expenses 1 May 1966-28 Fetruary 1967 = $4,000 +
Total vill exceed $10,000 by now (1 May 67)., ,

Realistically, much of LIRING-7 expense should be added to this total, since
1-7 sain funotion bas been to support LIRING-3 op.

«+ £@
LIRING-3 op has occupied ‘esse portion RBWTON tine oves post year. Plus time
from other Station and Headquarters personnel in support. It de an expensive op.

Has produced five dissems, Tvo of these later proven false, one proven to
be basically true (by LIENVOY), on other tvo have no furthur info either way.

LIRIEG-3 has also reported condiderable other info which cones under heading
of positive intel, but was not dissemed because at the tine he reported it
4t vas doubtful, known to be false, fragrentary, etc.

Over the past year it has not been possible to verify even one mfctimowaryx =|
important statement or clain of the many made by L63(persons he has talked toy}
actions he has.taken, information he has obtained, etc.). L-3 has claimed b
sections and convacts ranging from Mexico City to Havana, to Wuatenala City, i
to Texas, and pointe in betveos. While we know he traveled through these t
areas, nothing really conclusi-ve or key is confirmad. On the other hand,
several of his claizs are known to be false. SePratazeseeate a ——

Given o-r inability to check-out 1-3 statenents, na sélid conclusion or

evaluation of op 48 possible. 4 good bet would be that 1-3 has completely
fabricated 90% of his information and claired actions. Ris motive woubd be
money, since this op has paid off vary well eo far for him. SHH

A good bet would be that he suspects Rowton is US Intelligence, based on
the requirements levied on hix, the ready supply of money, the clandestinity
of the viole relationship, the Lopez Disz-Rico Galen info Rewton gave him.

Either looking for more money, favors, or out pf political inclination,
ho protebly vould have inforred the Cubans of his relationship with Rowton,
4f he suspects Rovton is US Intelligence,

Cubans could very possibly have not beliewdd 1-3 story. It is a wild one.
Or they could have been afraid of Mexican or US provocation, Certainly they
would be doubly esutdous on arze smggling after the embarresing Lopez affair.

Or they could be monitoring the vhole op, It doubtful they directing it, given
L-3's careless use of the telephone and involved story which too easy to
check, if ve peally made the effort) A good Cutan Intel officer, telling 1-3
what to do and say, should be able to do better, Or maybe L-3 doesn't follow
Guben instructions any better than he follows Rowton's,

co : i 7S April 1967

LIRING/3 - Norris Kk, UDHLETT Chronolopy

Carlos JURADO Delmar, a Mexican artist and existentialist,
is an unwitting ifformant who has exicen far leftist political
convictions, He has been assessed by his handler as unfriendly to
the U.S, and not a candidate for recruitzent, JURADO's wife, ‘arian
CHICHAY, a Chineee-Cuban, worked in the Cuban Embasgy’ in “exico City
until Novenber 1966 for LIPSNG/1 and LIRING/2. SOVTON:Fretends to
be a Greek businessman interested in developifisg lucrative, seni-legal
business with Quha. JURADO may have the immression that ROUT fe
Teally somehow connected vith Soviet intelligence - a notion RONTON
has not attempted to ek acemmase ia has convinced JURADO
that to be successful the two of then mst be fully aware of all the
realities of Cuban politics and commerce, JURADO, who lived: in Cuba
for a couple of years following CASTPO's accession, has maintained
friendships with some well-placed contacts in Cuba. He has made
three trips to Havana in connection with his relationship with
ROVTON, Who obtains information from JIRADO by elicitang and direct
questioning,

Asa result of the injection of .7TADO by Station Mexico

City into the sensational JULIAN LOPEZ Diaz/Guatemalan Arms Scuggling
case, JURADO was asked by the Cuban Embassy to Relp the GOC with their
sensitive adtivitées in Mexico and to go to Havana for a briefing

on what he cAuld do, To inject JURAD0 into the case, Station Mexico

City furnished him with some theretofore undisclosed information on



~ . ~

the arrest by ‘exican autborities of LOPEZ Diaby a Cuban diplomat, 77+

dager sTebt

allegedly aes fron a Guatemalan reporter who had obtainéd it fros

a member of the Guatemalan Cormunist party. In Havana, JUR*DO

discussed the case at length withd his friend and contact, Arnol

RODRIGUEZ Camps, a former Vice-Minister in the cuban Foreign Ministry.

He also told RODRIGUEZ details of a plan to form his Mexican and

Central Anerican contacts into a network which could support clandestine 5
sedunemt@mm, Cuban operations, RODRIGUEZ appeared to be. impressed, according
to DURADO's story, and introduced JURADO to Osmani CIENFUECOS, Chaircan

of the Foreign Affairs Comittee of the Central Comittee of the Cuban
Commmist Party (the body charged with the responsibility for

implementing Cuban subversion in 2). TIDAM renarted : :
that CIENFUECOS expressed appreciation for JURADO's offer of assistance and
statéd that Cuba is ‘interested in exporting subversion to Central :
fmerica to hargss the United States Saeco TET

CIENFUEGOS reportedly went on to say that the Osdanstrustee JURADO

but not his onntacts about wion they know nothéng. He furthe:

explained that one untrustuorthy Link could blow the entire effort=

and and then suggested that JiADO be given the opportunity to test the
sincerity of his contacts. RODRIGUEZ reportedly suggested that

MURADO arrange a deal to barter Cuban Nickel ore for weed killer.

(Cuban Nickel ore is already being offered in Mexico by other dealers and
Mexican-made weed killer is readily available on the open narket

in Mexico).



oo ; ae

Despite Ileadquarters su” apaieba et = go slowly in setting

BIS B fecvine TRE:

up his support net to the Guatenalan “qurtitas, ‘$85- ROVTON sett him

to establish contact istkm with them on the “ecican/Cuatenalan border
in early Decenber 1966, JURADO established contact with a mah in
Hexico Gity who gave him a letter cf introduction toa wonan in Cuatemala
City. The wonan was to carry the letter to Cesar MONTES, Guatemalan
guerrilla leader and explain thet he cculd mfif trust JURADO and should
take advantage of his offer, At the same time JURADO sent a letter to
RODRUGUEZ in Havana explaining that he wonld not make his comercial
contact witting of any arms passed through the proposed channel.
Hie also sent ifgiomnation on weed killers and requested Jetails
for possibly consumating the deal.

In mid-December JURADO again traveled to a town on the
Mexican side of the Guatemalan border and oantacted the guerrilla
representatives, tle reported’ that he was taken "black" — the
border to Guatemala City where the guerrillas told him of some of
theit problens in obtaining material, specifically © mentioning their
need for some radio tubes and mecical supplies. JURADO committed
himself to providing those items along with.a concrete proposal for
regular contact. The guerrillas reportedly told JURADO that they
could handle the goods from the Mexican side of the border to their base
camp in Guatemala.

At this point the “exico City Station proposed to: mount a

- paralle’ operation involving Norris K.UMPHLETT,. a 33 year old Greek

who was recruited in 1952 by BCVION to penetrate the U.S., Creek, and
Cuban Communist Parties, UMPHLETT performed adequately inthese tasks

ge ceqete,



including aif but the last two years of aver five spent in (uba.
POYTON sent UMPHLIAT to Guatemala in late February 1966 ona
“pusiness development” trip to establish contact with ‘etenents who

could be used as support élements for subversion including clandestine

resupply of guerrilla groups. It was propsoed that these clenents would

in fe fhe, po ln Ein Hime

be offered to the CUIS @

City where ne has harbored Lf
an EDA deputy in Athens. UMPHLETT is to exploit this relationship
tn an effort to land a job in the business as a cover to assist the
Creek in clandestine activity.

In nid-January 1967 JURADO reported that the Cuban Arbassador hak
called him aside at a party to teil him that ROORICUEZ cabled the
Enbassy to request JURANO's presence in Cuba for additional céscussions.
Rather than jump on Havana's cormand, JURADO called RODRICIEZ to
infdn him he would have to make encther trip te Cuatemala first.
JURADO reported that he was approached by another Cuaterala Communist
‘ho cdaimed, in confidence, that he was part of the FAR network
a Mexico and had been advised that massive Soviet aid (in excess
of: $200,000) was available to the FAR "directly" but with qualifications
that would in effect place the FAR under complete Soviet control. He
explained that it was for this reason that the FAR was raising funds

‘on its own by subh means as bank and train robberies, in Central America,

ar



fan i es

At the end of Janugay JU400 reported he had made contact ;
with the FAR representatives in Cuatenala City and had riade errangenents
for permanent liaison in ‘fexico City and Havana, He was given contact
instructions which ould he initiated by the FAR representatives, and ~a> “ele!
agstecacé to passthe supplejs (that he had committed hinself to
providing) to the contact man in “exico City.

A special envoy from Cuba visited JURADO the day after he
returned fron Cuatenala for the ostensible purpose of passing on
some advise and guidance of a security nature, RO'TON speculated that the
Qubanw - particularly ROORICUEZ - were afradd JURADO had taken offense
at their treatment of him on his last snixitkel visit to Cuba, and sent
someone to salve his feelings, The envoy gave JURADO a lot of advice on how

to handle himself with respect to the Cuban Embassy persoriel,

ral,
eee ec cE PA EE SY Ne er he earns eel TE,

American intelligence, and on security and tradecraft in ge

On 15 February HEPPERA, the Cuban Erbassy chauffeur anda
friend of JURADO, met with the agent to tell him some rumors he
had heard involving JURADO including the statement that there were
certain “hostile elements" toward JURADO in the Embassv, SCWTON
cautéoned JURADO not to be too aloof with the Enbassy causing then
to react unfavorabley toward him for no reason ter hkhxtx than
that they were out of touch with him. .

On 20 February "Carcia" the FAR representative in seniel
set up a seeting with JUPANO but agredd that JIRAMMs plan.te take

at ane then slawench tie
the goods to the “exican/Cuatemalan border was better than’ “exico

—



a: an

City because of “the incredibie network of agents run by the North
Anericars throughout the city." He said that the FAR didn’t have an
urgent need for the supplies because they were adequately suppléed
by the Soviets and Cubans but that the FAR had no objections to
JURADO dealing with Yon Sosa's !R-13"Novecber which is not so well
supplied. "Garcia" said he > aS 5 scheduled to traval to me Soviet
Union and wanted to discuss 17 thes aspects of BEB suport
operation so that adftivies could move ahead in his absence, “Carcia"
contrasted the "bother" of dealing with the Cbans with the ita A of
Telations with the Soviets,

Gn 2 March JURADO traveled tothe Mexico/Cuatemala border
town of San Cristobal to deliver /the ow supplies to the representatives

Of the FAR guerrillas. “Carcia™ showed up and he and JURADO went

to a tidn neareé-the Guatemalan border where they transferred the

goods. "Garcia" said he would take’ possession.of the refrigerated

drugs in ‘'exico City after Teturming from the USSR, ‘The FAR Tep-
Tesentatives explained’ they had a fairly good network in Texas for

the acquisition of ams but were having troubie transporting them.

They indicated JURADO'’s plan vas better than anything they have going

and would probably adopt it. Yefore he left for USSR, "Garcia"

called JURADO to tell him that Cesar MONTES and Yon SOSA had patched

up their differences and the Cuztemalan guerrilaa riovement could move shead
faster now,


ANALYSIS AND CO @ENTS

INTENT OF THE OPERATION: To provide inforantior Cuatemalan
insurgency; Cuban - and perhaps - Soviet support of subversion
in Guatemala; the use of Mexico by the Cubans and Soviets
to support Guatemalan insurgency; identify people, pin-point

1 locations, and establish metiiods of operation of insurgents

i and their support ntevorks in Cuatemala and Mexico.

| 2. ESTABLISIMENT OF SUPPLY NETWORK ~ furton is having

| LIRING/3 establish a supply network in "exico ait Guatewale.to 7235
i materiel to the insurgents in Cuatemala, The Supplies could

1 originate in cibher the U.S,, Cu:a, or by:sea from any countrye

In doing this, menbers of existing support networks are not being

i jdertified - only the aliases of some of LIRINC/3's contacts.

‘This network could very well operate parallel to other such channels
and we would not learn any nore than we are learning now. In fact,

we could conceivably assist Cuatemalan insurgency and get Little

“or nothing in rethrn -- and should the operation go awry this agency
would be hard put toexplain the circumstances, You can be sure the
leftists would have a field day. We are not adverse to providing

some materiel as long as we get something in return.



2. LIRING/3'B REPORTING + None of the iffornation LIRING/3.
has reported has been corrobotated by other sources. Only the
existence and presence of some of the contacts has been cofifirmed by
technical operations at the Station, but not the information. So
far we, and ROWTON, have no choice but to belégeve most of what
LiRING/S tolis us. (Govrowis capability in the Spanish language is
only adequate and one taped meeting showed that LIRING/3 ‘Spole Tight

v" a)
Qvor ROWTON and dominated the conversation, | It is conceivable that

LIRING/3 is controlling the entiie operation and that °°WTON
is not able to discern this, Also, because of the umssual nature of
their relationship and ROWTOWS< cover DrWT $6

shle te question

LIRING/3 toof deeply in some areas and not at all in others, And

we are assuming thet ROWTON's cover is effective,

3. SURVEILLANCE ~ The LIRTNC/3 cperation has been going
for over a year now and the only surveillance of the agent has been
an abortive attempt at tapping his telephone and an audio device
in the safehouse in which he. and his wife are now living. His phone
should be tapped constantly, his mail should be intercepted and read, he
should be survéilled for a couple of weeks to establish his pattern
of activities, photographs should be taken of him and his contacts,
and he should be investigated to find out where his money comes
from, where it goes, what his wife does all day, ete,



t

iad tad “

4, “SUMARY - After a ye: the operation is not paying off
as it should and the agency and ROTON are committed to a stituaticn
that could backfire in several ways. Steps should be taken soon to confirm
LIRING/3's access and information and to establish beyond the
shadow of a doubt his bona fide, Headquarters is not at all convinced
that 1) LIRINC/3 believes ROVTON's cover story, 2) That LIRINC/3
is in contact with the FAR, 3) that the opposition is not playing
