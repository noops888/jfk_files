:

NO INDEXING BEGUINED

ONLY QUALIFIED DESA

CAN JUDGE INDEXING

1o This dispatch is simply to record for the AMLASH/1 Ille Station

notiun en certain aspects of the case.

No action by Headquarters 18 required.

2. Paul I. STOCKWOOD gIve AMIASH/1 5000 franes on 17 February in :

accordance with reference.

AMLASH/1 earlier had stressed to STOCKWOOD that he was

completely without funds folloving his return from Madrid, adding the thought that

he was completely "in our hands" and thus dependent upon us for help. The receipt

of the requested assistance seemed to encourage him personally.

3. The safebcuse meeting at which the money was passed vas brief because

AMLASH/1 had an appointment for lunch at the PERUMEN mission with UNSNAFU/19.

There was time, however, for STOCKWOOD to go over each of the questions which

was broached in reference. With the exception of Information regarding personnel

shifts resulting from the recent PBRUMEN chiefs of mission meeting in Madrid,

ANTASH/1 had nothing to offer in response to paragraph tro of DIR 65502. His

material on persornel changes reached the Station, as he said 1t would, via

UNSNAPU/9 and was duly reported. Other Items which remained on Matthew H. ONTRICil'S

debrief list and which drew responses from AMLASH/1 have been incerporated in

subsequeut Station traffic on the points in question.

4. AMIASH/1 noted that IDENTITY 1 of the PERUMaN establishment In Madrid

has received three months? "grace" with respeet to his ordered return to the home

land. AMIASH/1 said that IDENTITY 1 has been completely won over to the AMLASH

cause. He noted that IDENTITY l has on at least one occasion in the past talked

with a representative of KUBARK in Madrid. (This point has been diseussed with

Chief of Station, Madrid, who is personally aware of the background of IDENTITY I,

whose Information reached the Station via QUOTA).

AMLASH/1 also mentioned that AMLASH/3 1s a very close friend of

IDENTITY /2.

Their friendship plus IDENTITY 2's definite anti-regime attitude

makes IDENTITY 2 a likely collaborator with the AMLASH group although not

necessarily sith KUBARK.

AMLASH/1 added that AMLASH/3 was going to the Dominican

Republie In February. He reported that AMHIP/1 was to speak with "B111" about

this particular case.
