Dear Mr. Blakey:

..

In re: James Braden

SSN

JFK Act 6 (3)

Thank you

for your letters of June 19 and 21, 1978,

requesting copies of documents pertaining to the assassination

of President John F. Kennedy, and asking that a member of

your staff be allowed to meet

and speak with a Service employee

concerning Mr. James Braden.

We

are enclosing edited copies of documents which may

relate to the assassination of President Kennedy and which

were provided to the Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence

in 1977. However, a Los Angeles memorandum report prepared

by Special Agent John P. Daley and dated November 17, 1970,

was not included. It is our understanding that this document,

appropriately deleted, is included in material available in

Los Angeles.

Information deleted from the documents consists

of third party tax information.

I have asked our District Director in Dallas to permit

Special Agent Gene Boren to meet with your designated staff

member and to discuss with him the enclosed documents.

Any

discussions relative to the tax affairs of Mr. James Braden

will, of course, be limited

• to that information covered by

Mr. Braden's waivers.

K11l Squad

¿Allegations have

been made that BUNKER IUNT purchased

a ranch in

Southern California to be used in training "kill squads" to help rid the

world of communists. Also, the squads were to be used in foreign coun-

crles to protect the HUNTS'

foreign operations. This allegation is

based on conversations overheard and there

15 only a small

amount of

documentation supporting this statement.

We know that BUNKER owns

property in Southern California, and BUNKER,

together with LAMAR, has had unknown connections with a man in

California named EUGENE BRADING (alias JIM BRADEN,

JAMES BRADLEY LEE,

and JAMES LEE COLE). According to his "wrap sheet" in the available

files, BRADING has a record of burglary, operating a gambling housc,

bookmaking, mall fraud conspiracy, and

embezzlement dating back. to 1934.

BRADING was allegedly arrested in Dallas, Texas, on the date of JOHN F.

KENNEDY's assassination, questioned and released.

Also, he reportedly

was in the HUNTS' offices on the day before the assassination. He was

said to be fifteen minutes away from the point of the assassination of

ROBERT KENNEDY shortly before his shooting.

BRADING is said to be a member of the LA COSTA COUNTRY CLUB near San

Clemente, California, and he spends a great deal of time there.

of Investigation had taps on the telephones of CURINGTON, PAUL ROTHERMEL

California people who think that there was a conspiracy involving these

parties, including LAMAR and BUNKER, in the assassination. A CBS news

Commentator by the name of PETER NOYES has a large file on this allegation.

WILSON said it would be interesting to know just what the exact tie-in

between BUNKER, LAMAR, BRADEN and the California police characters toQe:

He said that all of BUNKER'S land would be shown on the real property

blue shects and in additional to those offices where we could locate those,

there is another office, the ad valorem, which would have copies.

be taken from BEEMAN and CUNYUS, and copies of these depositions will be

forwarded tö us. He stated that on February 26 they plan to take a

deposition from FLOYD DANELS and they will question him concerning, for

BROWN to the Wolves and state that he had no ideal that these three people

were making money on the side. HUNT denied that his signature was on the

letters which were allegedly given to Mr. CURINGTON promising lifetime

employment, et ceteria.

21. In connection with Mr. HUNT's mislabeling and misbranding food items,

Mr. WILSON mentioned an!

amazeaid"

which took the place of the old gastro

magic! He stated that the federal government about six months ago had

filed suit for the discontinued use of the amazeaid and, therefore, the

sales stopped. He said that there were no criminal charges dropped; that

Mr. HUNT just agreed not to sell any more of the product. He stated this

amazeaid was stemmed from a formula which was furnished to Mi. KUNT by

his doctor in New York--DI. KING. The formula called for the aíd to be

in liquid form; however, MI. HUNT nade it into a powdered tablet and

without naking any lab or clinic test of any test on human beings begin

selling it in 1963. This suit was filed by the government in 1970;

therefore, he had seven years of sales. The product was to cure stomach-

aches, diarrhea, overindulgence and hangovers, among other things.

LIVINGSTON, CUNYUS and all of the label people had told Mi. HUNT that

this product and the method of advertising it was violating the laws;

however, Mr. HUNT said he was willing to take the chance.

22.

In another instance, the Pure Food and Drug Administration filed suit

against HLH FOOD PRODUCTS for selling contaminated pepper which contained

rat droppings. The plant manager, JAMES WOODARD, received a two to five-

year probated

sentence for this violation. Mr. HUNT was not included in

this particular allegation. This occurred within the last two years:

WOODARD is presently working for MARY KAY COSMETICS. GEORGE CUNYUS told

MT. WILSON

that TIM TIMINS

Jin order to keep Mr. HUNT out of this particular violation.

23.

Another area of mislabeling and violation of Pure Food and Drug Acts

was the sale of ALAVERA.. Mr. Wilson stated that when this ALAVERA was

made into a jell that it tested to have a high bacteria count caused by

the process of making it into the form of jell. He said that Mr. HUNT

had been advised on several occaions by his laboratory that this jell did

contain such a high count; however, it is still on the shelves and still

selling.. He said files on these particular violations would be in the

laboratory records under the care of DI. CARL RAU. He said that Dr. RAU

would testify and tell us anything that HUNT instructed him to do. RAU

is a PHD and would be a competent witness. to testify in behalf of HLI

FOOD PRODUCTS on the testing of the bacteria count.

24. Another area of selling and mislabeling foods would be the bottle

water which Mr. WILSON discussed having cone fIon INDIANS HOI SPRINGS..

On all of these violations Mr. HUNT gave his personal instructions that
