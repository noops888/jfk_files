corresponds to JFK Exhibit No. 94 in the Committee's hearing

Have you had a chance to read that letter?

Mr. Shaw. I read it justnow.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you understand it?

Mr. Shaw. I understand it.

Mr. Goldsmith. I also would like to hand you the

Committee's rules and resolutions and ask you at this time

to read Rule No. 4 to yourself.

Mr. Shaw. I do not need counsel.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you understand that, under the

Committee rules, that you have a right to receive a copy of

the statement you are going to give us at this deposition?

MI. Shaw. I should hope so, to check it for accuracy.

Mr. Goldsmith. However, by virtue of the arrangement

that the Committee has worked out with the Central Intelligence

Agency, we have been asked

to request of Agency employees that

they waive their right to receive a copy of the deposition

for their own retention. By that, I mean we would certainly

be willing to grant you access to the deposition, to correct

it in any way necessary, but the Agency has requested that

we ask you to waive your right to receive an actualy copy of

the deposition.

Mr. Shaw. I have no problem with that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thank you.

For the record, I would like to say that the Committee's

mandate is to investigate the assassination of the President.

The scope of the mandate

includes who killed the President,

was there a conspiracy?

We are also required to evaluate

Mr. Goldsmith. Would your State Department file, if

reviewed by a member of this Committee, indicate that you were

actually a CIA employee?

MI. Shaw. I have no idea.

Mr. Goldsmith. You do not understand how the cover

arrangement would work between the Agency and the Department

of State?

Mr. Shaw.. I have never had anything to do with the

setting up of such cover. It would well be that there might

be some sort of an indicator of flag, or something in that

file that would indicate to a person who knew the ropes that

I was not bona fide.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would there be a personnel file on you

at the Central Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Shaw.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. As a matter of procédure, in terms of

how you get paid, do you get paid by the Department of State?

Mr. Shaw.

No. I am under, at the present time, nominal

state cover.. I actually, as far as the Department of State

is concerned, resigned over there in 1973, I believe. At

the present time, I am paid by the. Agency.

Mr. "Goldsmith. When you were working under cover, were

you being paid by State at that time?

Mr. Shaw.

Yes, I was.

Mr: Goldsmith. Are you familiar at all with the

literature that has been generated by the assassination of

the President and the work done by the Warren Commission?

Mr. Shaw. Very little. I just noticed that green book

there a minute ago. I have never read that thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. Book 5, for the record, of the Senate

Committee Report.

Mr. Shaw. I have

seen copies of the Warren Commission

Report in various places around the government, but I never

read it.

MI. Goldsmith. Did you ever work as a consular officer?

Mr. Shaw. Yes, I did.

Mr. Goldsmith. When you worked as a consular officer,

were you required to fulfill both responsibilities as a con-

sular officer and as a CIA employee?

MI. Shaw. To a certain extent.

For example, I have never issued a visa. I have issued

a passport for another consular officer who accepted the

application and I would be on the road in northwestern Mexico

and issued the passport to the American citizen concerned.

I have done a modicum of what we call protection and

welfare work. This would usually involve being again on the

road, stopping in, for example, in a prison to see if there

was an American citizen there, to find out what the story

was, why he was there, how he was being treated and that sort

of thing, and relay that information to the consular when I

got back.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long have you been working for the

Office of the Inspector General?

Mr. Shaw.

Since August of 1976.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you have any responsibility in the

writing of the 1977 Inspector General Report pertaining to

the CIA's handling of the investigation of the Kennedy

assassination?

Mr. Shaw. None whatever.

• Mr. Goldsmith.

Has anyone ever interviewed you before

pertaining to the Mexico City situation as far as it pertained

to Oswald?

Mr. Shaw.

Yes. It was about that time of '76,

some

body interviewed me in the CIA Headquarters building, and I

think it was a Senate Committee, but I aminot sure.

They had

some files.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you give your testimony under oath

at that time?

Mt. Shaw.

No, not that I remember.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did any CIA person ever interview you

concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City and

the operations of the Mexico City station?

Mr. Shaw. I would have to qualify that. We discussed

the subject, of course, in Mexico City at the time of the

assassination, of immediately after the assassination.

to your knowledge, in Mexico City in 1963?

MI. Shaw. No. I would not have known anything about

Oswald's activities anyway.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are you familiar with the photograph

that was taken in 1963 that was

reportedly linked to Oswald

and which subsequently turned out not to be a picture of

Oswald?

MI. Shaw. I am familiar with a photograph that was

identified by people at the station in Mexico City as possibly

being an American-appearing person. I do not know that it

was every considered to be Oswald.

I think, if I remember correctly, what they were doing -

Mr. Goldsmith. We will get into that. My question is,

did anybody from Headquarters ever ask you about that parti-

cular photograph or the circumstances surrounding it?

Mr. Shaw. Negative.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did anybody from Headquarters ever ask

you to give a statement or report as to the manner in which

the surveillance operation in Mexico City were underatken in

1963?

Mr. Goldsmith.

Would you give us your assessment of

his competence?

Mr. Shaw. Competence. It is difficult, because I was

not looking from on high. He was a brilliant man. He was

reputed to have a doctorate in mathematics. He had an uncanny

ability to remember numbers and he carried in his head the

file numbers of what we called P-files in Mexico City. P

stood, I think, for personality. A P number usually was four

digits or so, maybe five digits.

And he carried all these numbers in his head and he could

mark something for such and such a file in black ink -- he

always wrote in black ink -- putting the number down. He had

a very good memory for numbers.

Winn and I were friendly. We were not close.

We were

not on the same level at all.

effective, Chief of Station.

Mr. Goldsmith. What type of file-keeping system did

he have in effect, without asking you to describe it in detail?

By that, my question is directed towards his thoroughness and

comprehensiveness.

MI. Shaw. I would say that he probably had one of the

most -- let me see -- complete file systems in being in the

Agency. I think that he, my personal opinion is that he went

overboard, and we had so much stuff back in our files, it

was hard to believe the amount of paper we had in there.

His tendency was not to rely on cross-indexing. If

you have a document, this piece of paper means something to

you and you want to keep it and it has 15 names on it, he

was quite capable of setting up 15 files for the same piece

of paper. And we had a tremendous file room.

I often wondered if we needed that much paper. It was

very thorough. I am not a technician as far as managing

files, but I do know that the people who worked in the file

room were kept very, very busy.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who were Mr. Scott's chief deputies?

Let me rephrase the question. Upon which individuals did he

tend to rely the most?

MI. Shaw. He had one Deputy who was Allen White.

AS

far as reliance on other people, I would say he relied very

heavily on Annie Goodpasture -- not in any way in a command

function, but as a Girl Friday.

He also seemed to think rather highly of a former one-time!

FBI agent named George Monroe.

Mr. Goldsmith. What about David Phillips?

Mr. Shaw.

Yes. Dave Phillips ran the, what we called the

CA side of the shop, covert action, mostly propaganda. I came

to Mexico City with the understanding that I was going to head

up the Cuban shop. Very soon after I arrived there, Dave

Phillips was tapped - it was while we were still in the old

Embassy building.

He was tapped and named the new Cuban Office Chief.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did that happen in October '63?

Mr. Shaw.. I don't know. I do not remember.. But it was

not too long after I was there, and I was asked, I think by

Dave; I don't remember - if I had any objections to continuing

to serve in Cuba.

I liked Dave, I respected him. I did not feel that I

was being hurt, hurt careerwise, to step back and I was very

interested

in Cuban operations, so I did willingly, let us say,

relinquish command, if you want to, of Cuban Ops and I served

Dave as one more officer.

Later on, after Dave left, a year or two later, I once

¡again took over the Cuban Ops group.

Mr. Goldsmith. You were in charge of Cuban Operations at

the beginning. Then Phillips took it over at some point and

then, after Phillips left, you went back to that position?

Mr Shaw. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Our review of Agency records indicates

that Phillips would have assumed that position on October of

'63. Would that be consistent with your recollection?

Mr. Shaw. My recollection would have been, had you not

told me this based on your review of the files, that it took

place earlier than October, but I do not know. I really do not

know.

Mr. Goldsmith. My questions are going to be confined,

unless I indicate to the contrary, to the period up to the

end of 1963. So, from the time of your arrival in Mexico City

until the end of 1963, prior to the time that Mr. Phillips

assumed the position of Cuban operations -

Mr. Shaw. Chief.

Mr. Goldsmith. Chief would be the word, and you had those

responsibilities, what did those responsibilities include?

Mr. : : Shaw."i.

Since it was not ratified to me upon my

arrival that I was, indeed, Chief of Cuban Ops, I simply con-

sidered myself to be one more case officer working against

the Cuban target. Our basic interest was in effecting pene-

trations of the Cuban government.

What we wanted most of all were effective penetrations

of the Cuban Embassy, the Cuban Intelligence Service, and some

possible line-in to their communications

setup.

There were two. I did not place either one,

have been normal for me, for example, to see any information

Mr. Goldsmith. In light of that, do you know what infor-

MI. Shaw. I do not recall, and I do not recall the

specifics of anything. You may have something in your files

with my name on it; I do not know what LITAMII-9 produced.

I do have the recollection of the sense of feeling on the

part of those people that there was no exultation or jubila-

tion or happiness whatsoever inside the Cuban Embassy at the

assassination of President Kennedy•

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the penetration agents ever indicate

that Oswald had been to the Embassy and had stated that he was

going to attempt to kill the President?

Mr. Shaw. No, not that I know of.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did any of those agents

ever indicate that

Oswald had had contact with the Agency - with the Embassy,

contacting the appropriate people at the Agency.

Mr. Shaw. I think if you requested the Agency for those

two names, it would probably produce them. I wouldn't want to!

Goldsmith. I understand your position perfectly.

I hope you understand mine.

Mr. Goldsmith. I would not want you to go back to the

compel an answer out of you.

Mr. Shaw.

I will not say any such thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. Fine.

For the record, would you spell the cryptonyms of these

penetration agents?

Mr. Shaw. One of them was LITAMII-7 -- I-I-T-A-M-I-I - 7.

The other was LITAMII-9.

MI. Goldsmith. Are these two agents still active?

Mr.

Shaw. Neither one is active. I am quite sure that

neither one is active.

Mr. Goldsmith. For purposes of clarification, LITAMII-7,

was that agent working out of the consulate?

Mr. Shaw. That agent was an employee of the consular

section of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. LITAMIL-9 was an

officer of the Embassy.

Mr. Goldsmith. MI. Shaw, on the question of the identity

of these two agents, when you go back to the Agency, could you

raise this question with the appropriate individual, appropri-

ate superior authority, and we will do the same so that some

"time this week we can get together on that?

Mr. Shaw. I do not see any reason for us to get together.

You can get it from them, I am sure. It is just that I have

rather strong feeling about protecting anybody who has

cooperated with us.

It is not that I consider you do not have a right to that

information, if you feel that you need it. It is just that I

cannot bring myself to reveal the true name of an agent unless

I am required to do so.

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that concern. I certainly

respect it.

(Pause)

I have been informed by my researcher, Dan Hardway, that

the Agency is in the process of looking into this issue.

Mr. Shaw.

Okay.

Mr. Goldsmith. At this time, I would like to get into

the area of the telephone taps that were in operation in 1963

against the Cuban Embassy and consulate. My first question is,

what responsibility, if any, did you have with regard to the

telephone tap operation?

Mr. Shaw. No responsibility. I saw the product,

usually:

Mr. Goldsmith. Who was the individual who was in charge

of that tap?

Mr. Shaw. I do not know whose responsibility it was.

"I rather suspect that it may have been Ann Goodpasture's, but

I do not know for sure. I do not remember.

OT..

There were two telephone operations, two tap operations.

One of them was unilateral and one of them was joint with the

Mexican government.

Mr. Goldsmith. Which one was the unilateral one? By

that, I mean which phones were covered by the unilateral one?

Mr. Shaw. There was a mix, and I cannot recall which

were which. It may well have been that we were tapping some

Cuban Embassy phones unilaterally, and some of them were being

tapped jointly.

I know that there was coverage on the joint tap

operation, which I believe was called LIENVOY. I am not sure.

Mr. Goldsmith. That is correct.

You indicated that you think Ann Goodpasture may have been

responsible for the telephone tap operation against the Cuban

operation. What basis do you have for that?

Mr. Shaw. Responsible in the sense of picking up the take.

I am not sure of that, because I know she did some of that kind

of work. I am not sure who did it. We used to get copies of

the transcripts and I remember - I am sure I saw some of the

Cuban stuff on joint taps. And then, of course, taps that

were run by the Mexican government.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you review the transcripts that came

in as a matter of regular routine?

Mr. Shaw.

Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you read all of them?.

Mr. Shaw. NO.

Mr. Goldsmith. Which ones would you read?

Mr. Shaw. I would have been interested primarily in the

Cuban ones, and what they called the resuma -- it was sort of

a Spanish word for resume - the resuma was a distillation,

if you will, of the digest of the joint tap that was prepared

You look at the resuma,

which may be two pages, and you may have the gist of what might

be a whole bunch of pages of tap.

Mr. Goldsmith. Normally, you read transcripts of conver-

sations that took place on telephones of the Cuban Embassy,

is that correct?

Mr. Shaw. Normally, I read some of that stuff. I do not

remember whether I saw it all or not, because quite a bit of

it was processed by other people. I do not know who they were,

people on the outside, I suppose. And I read summaries of

what appeared on these things, but I remember also, at times,

seeing the verbatim - Man Outside says so and so; Person

Inside, Woman Inside, says such and such.

Mr. Goldsmith. Sometimes you would get summary trans-

criptions of the summary conversations or English and sometimes

you would get verbatim translations, is that correct?

Mr. Shaw. Yes. I would see them, I would not get them.

They would go past me. I would see them.

Mr. Goldsmith. Was it more likely that what you would see

in verbatim form, conversations that took place, for example,

in Russian and had to be translated before you received them?

Mr. Shaw. I certainly would not see any conversations

in Russian, because the Cuban Embassy did not have any Russian

conversations. I cannot really answer that question. I am

not really sure I fully understand it. I do remember seeing

variety of take, what we call take, from the various tap

operations.

This take

sometimes was processed into English.

The stuff that appeared in the resuma was in Spanish. Sometimes

the conversations were typed out in Spanish and translated into

English. I prefer them in Spanish, because I am at home in

Spanish.

Mr. Goldsmith. How many people reviewed the take from

the surveillance operation of the Cuban Embassy and consular

telephones?

Mr. Shaw.

I have no idea. I assume there were quite a

few.

The stuff was widely passed around.

Mr. Goldsmith. As a matter of routine, how many people

would review them?

MI. Shaw. I have no idea.

Mr. Goldsmith. How many people were in Cuban operations?

Mr. Shaw. I would quess five or six.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who were they?

Mr. Shaw. Däve Phillips.

Mr. Goldsmith. We are talking now about the period 1963?

Mr. Shaw. That is right. Dave Phillips, myself,

I am trying to think of the girl's name. We had

various secretaries in there. I do not know who was the secre-

¡tary in '63.

Mr. Goldsmith. They would not review every transcript

Mr. Shaw.

I imagine Winn Scott; I do not know about

Allen White.

Winn was pretty much, he tended to review almost

all of the paper that came in and out of the station.

Mr. Goldsmith. Are you saying that there was no routine

procedure established for who was to review the take from the

Cuban telephone surveillance operations?

Mr. Shaw. I am saying that, when I got there, the case

officers in Cuban Ops saw this stuff that was routed around

through the station and that persisted during the time that

I was there.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am not sure that the answer -

Mr. Shaw. How that was routed, I am not sure.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you customarily see every conversa-

picked up the tapes - don't consider this gospel, but this

is my understanding - picked up tapes from the various listen-

ing posts, some

of which had been processed by people in the

listening post;

some of which had not. But they, in turn,

either processed those tapes or took them to people to continue

the processing in case they had a foreign lanquage in them, or

something, and then turn them over to the station.

Somebody went out from the station, probably with a little

attache case or something, and picked up takes again. It is

my understanding that the person primarily involved in that

was Ann Goodpasture, but I do not know for sure.

Mr. Goldsmith.

Who was the first person that the trans

cripts would go to upon their arrival at the Embassy?

Mr. Shaw. I rather suspect Winn Scott, because I remember

great numbers of those white pages that came across our desk:

had P numbers written on them in black ink by winn Scott.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know how many lines were being

tapped at the Cuban consulate?and Embassy?

Mr. Shaw. I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. You reviewed the transcripts and summaries

of these conversations for two years and you have no idea how

many lines were tapped?

Mr. Shaw. No. This was fifteen years aço. I can give

you a guess.

Mr. Goldsmith. Sure. A best quess would be helpful.

Mr. Shaw. I would quess three or four lines. The primary

interest was in the Soviets. You had far more converage.

That is a guess.

MI. Goldsmith. Understood.

Mr. Shaw. I would quess, off-hand, two lines in the

Embassy, one line in the consulate.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know if the Cuban consul's telephone

was tapped?

Mr. Shaw.

If the consulate line was tapped --

Mr. Goldsmith. It would have been his?

MI. Shaw.

Probably it would have been his, but they may

have had a direct line in there. I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. How would a telephone tap actually work?

I am talking now about the actual mechanics of the tap.

Mr. Shaw.

I do not know. I never had anything do do

with them. I know they used to take some of their taps at

what. they call the junction boxes. These would be the boxes

out in the street where lines came in to be fed into this

central -- I would rather suspect that the joint operations

were mostly done at the central, since the Mexican government

simply could have issued orders, you will tap such and such a

phone.

Mr. Goldsmith. My question is oriented towards the

following. Once a tap has been placed on a line, would that

mean that all calls, ingoing or outgoing, on that phone would

be picked up, so long as the tap is in effect?

Mr. Shaw.

So long as it is in effect, yes. Whether those

would appear in the transcripts is another matter. If it

was like

a wrong number, or somebody saying pick up three rolls

and bring them home for lunch, probably it would not appear on

the transcript.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who would make that decision?

Mr. Shaw. Whoever transcribed the tapes.

Mr. Goldsmith. How much time would pass from the moment

that a call came in until the transcription passed across your

desk?

Mr. Shaw.

I cannot answer your question with any preci-

sion. There was a system in the Embassy whereby if you had

a

fast-breaking situation, or something like that, you could --

I sure would like to get the transcripts of such and such a

line fast, and that information would be processed and funneled

back in to the Embassy or into the station on a priority

basis.

I would quess, offhand, that it ran -- again, this is a

guess -- five, six, seven days.

Mr. Goldsmith. What about the high priority cases?

Mr. Shaw.

Sometimes you can get that pretty fast.

Mr. Goldsmith. Within a day?

Yes.

certain call, and I do not recall ever doing that. But it

was my understanding that if you expected some situation, that

you could levy a requirement - for example, let me give you

a for instance here.

Let us suppose that we, the station, someone in the sta-

tion was going to make a

recruitment pitch to a Soviet officer.

It would have been possible for the station to have organized

things so that there was a live body and not just a machine

hanging over phone calls coming in to the Soviet Embassy in

case the guy called up and said, let me tell you the discus-

sion I just had, or something like that.

This would be a little far-fetched, because a Soviet

would not be likely to handle it by phone. But in a case

where you are looking for something fast-breaking to protect

yourself, being on top of the situation -- it would not apply

much to Mexico, but if you had a revolutionary situation

breaking

out someplace, surely there is a possibility of

getting information very quickly off any given line.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would the transcripts be reviewed by .

you in chronological order?

Mr. Shaw. I got them in batches and I would review them

just in the order in which they came.

I might have shuffled

them in chronological order, yes. Quite often they came in

four or five or six pages stapled together.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would they tend to come in chrolological

order so you read a transcript from the 15th before the 16th?

MI. Shaw. Generally yes, right.

Mr. Goldsmith. What happened to the transcripts after

they were reviewed by you?

Mr. Shaw. They were usually routed. They had a routing

sheet on it, and they would go on to somewhere else. Where

they went, I do not know. Sometimes we would mark them for

files. Of course, if there were a transcript in there that

had specific information on somebody that we were interested

in, we would mark a copy for the files and it would go into

that person's - either their P-file, which was their personnel

"file, or into any operational self-file that would we make,

building up background information on a person, the little

"things like whether an officer's wife was unhappy with the maid

or with living conditions of the cost or what have you of the

drugstore. These little bits and pieces were built up and

those came from transcripts.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would these transcripts eventually get

sent to headquarters?

Mr. Shaw. I do not know. I will say that it was unlikely!

that Winn Scott ever threw anything away. It was somewhere,

probably, in the file room.

Mr. Goldsmith. What about the tapes? What would happen

with the tapes after a conversation had been transcribed?

that tapes were erased and reused, and they were used over

Now I would like you to take a look at CIA No. 197, the

second paragraph.

Mr. Shaw.

Okay.

Mr. Goldsmith. The second paragraph indicates that the

station is unable to compare the voices, as the first tape was

erased prior to the receipt of the second call.

Mr. Shaw. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Does that suggest to you that at least

one tape was still in existence on November 23rd, the date

that this cable was sent? Otherwise, the second paragraph would

have said the tapes had been erased, routinely, whatever.

Mr. Shaw.

It could indicate that. It does not definitely

state that. That is an interpretation, certainly.

Mr. Goldsmith. Does that refresh your memory as to whether

for not there was a taping system?

Mr. Shaw. I do not have anything in writing. This did

not refresh my memory at all. This probably would have been

considered. Was this after the assassination?

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Mr. Shaw. No, I do not think it necessarily indicates,

but. I am surppised that it does not say that they were both

destroyed, or both erased.

Mr. Shaw. That is what it seems to say, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is that consistent with your memory now,

at the time?

Mr. Shaw.. No, I do not have any idea.

I was not involved

in tape pick-ups or tape erasures.

Mr. Goldsmith. The Oswald telephone calls, as we will see

later on, came in within approximately four days of each other,

if, as CIA 239 indicates, the tapes were normally retained for

two weeks prior to being routinely erased. Does

that suggest

I to you that the Oswald tape was, for some reason, treated in

an unusual manner, because either the first call came in, let's

say September 27th. By the time the second call came in, the

first tape had already been erased..

Mr, Shaw.:

No, it does not suggest that to me. = what is this nur

ber here:- because thismessage came out 9 December 63.

What it

suggests to me is that, subsequent to the assassination, is

that the station was to hold tapes for a minimum of two weeks.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please read into the record what 239 says.

that the tapes were routinely erásed and used over again.

far as the time lag, you know as much about it, and probably

more than I do, by now.

Mr. Goldsmith. What responsibility, if any, did you have

with regard to the photo-surveillance operation against the

Cuban Embassy and consulate?

Mr. Shaw. I had no responsibility for that operation

until after I reassumed the Cuban Ops section which would have

been the day Phillips left for Mexico, probably a year or

two down the road. I do know, however, that the operation --

there was a Cuban photo, or a photo operation against the

Cuban Enbassy•

I do not remember why, but I think that observation was

not active in the period when Oswald was in Mexico. If I

remember correctly, the man, to the best of my knowledge who

handled that, who was actually the inside case officer, if

you will, was the little guy who was snapping the pictures,

was a fellow by the name of Robert Zambarnadi, and I believe

he is retired and living in Mexico. I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who was the station case officer responsible

for running the photo-surveillance operation against the

Cubans?

Mr. Shaw. As far as I know, it was Robert Zambarnardi,

We used to get batches of pictures. One of the

I who was that? And he'disay, that's a courier, of that's the

new officer

who just arrived, or I do not know who this guy

was, but he came in and talked to so and so, that sort of

thing.

We used to try to identify people with those pictures.

Mr. Goldsmith. How many photo bases were there taking

pictures of the Cuban consulate and Embassy?

Mr. Shaw.

Io the best of my knowledge, there was only

one photo base. At times, the consulate was not covered and

¡the Embassy was. If I may draw you a picture, this would be

the block, the compound block. The Cuban Embassy was the

big building up here, and there was a little gatehouse down

here. I do not remember whether it was in or out.

This was the consulate, on the corner. People who would

want to get visas would routinely appear here and they would

send them down the street and they would go into the consulate.

Sometimes they knew where they were going and they came in here,

or they asked a cab, take me to the Cuban consulate, they

would probably be delivered here.

This is a block, a city block. The house from which the

photographs were taken is over here on this corner. The

photographs were taken long distance down here and here. This

was not always covered. This was considered more important,

because it was routine - either there was a lot of routine

visa stuff here.

Later on, subsequent - gosh, it must have been a year

later. I do not remember just when -- we developed a system,

or somebody up here in the states who developed a system

whereby the camera would be triggered automatically. That is

movement - sort of like a photo-electric cell or something

movement up here in the picture that the camera was to cover

would cause a series of photos to be taken, maybe four or

five, zap, zap, zap, something like that.

But I believe that, at the time Oswald was in Mexico City,

not only was this down for some reason and not functioning,

but I believe, had it been functioning, that it would have

been individual picture snapping. I do not think that auto=

matic equipment was in Mexico at that time.

I could be

"wrong.

Mr. Goldsmith. I am not going to be able to introduce

this diagram into the record, so I am just going to describe

it as best as I can.

Excuse me, if I may interject. There was another building back

Yes.

that most of the people of interest would have been entering

the Embassy, not the consulaté?

Mr. Shaw. That is correct

Mr. Shaw. No, no way.

Mr. Goldsmith. Whose picture would be taken?

Mr. Shaw. For example, that you would normally in an

You would be limited by daylight. You would

not photograph a milkman, or a mailman or somebody who would

the Embassy if once you knew who he was, unless he was walking

with somebody.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you photograph all foreigners?

Mr. Shaw. I do not know. I would have to say the answer

is no. I never photographed any of them. Do you mean would

all foreigners be photographed? I would say, given the

¡limitations that I have enumerate, namely how long a person

can sit there and watch, and they have to take a break now

because there is little activity.. I am sure there were consider-

My question is, while surveillance base was in operation,

would a primary purpose of it be to take pictures of foreigners?

Mr. Shaw.::":. Yes. That would have been a primary

purpose. Not necessarily foreigners, but people you do not

recognize. Foreigners or Mexicans; Mexicans are foreigners

¡to us, of course.

Another thing they did, by the way, was they tried to

photograph the license plates of automobiles that came to these

I embassies.

Mr. Goldsmith. During what hours were these photo bases

in operation?

Mr. Shaw. I do not know. I would say most likely during

business hours and proper daylight conditions, when the

photographer was available to do the job.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would you read back that answer?

Answer: "I do not know. I would say most likely during

Mr. Goldsmith. What were your primary responsibilities

when you were down there? You were not involved in the photo-

surveillance operation; you were not involved - excuse me

for interrupting you.

Mr. Shaw.

Go ahead.

Mr. Goldsmith. You were not involved in the photo

surveillance operation and you were not involved in the wire

tap operation, so, my question is, what was your primary

responsibility?

Mr. Shaw•

My primary responsibility was to try to

effect penetrations of the Cuban government. I spent a good

bit of time with Cubans of the

non-Castro persuasion, attempt-

ing to identify Cubans of

the Castro persuasion that we might

go after.

By "go after," I mean attempt to recruit.

I spent a lot of time collecting information from the

Cuban asset on the outside to process into the intelligence

reports on what was happening in Cuba.

We had a system set up in Mexico City under an agent

called AMSATE who was the representative of the exile commun

ity. He would arrange to meet, help, debrief, Cubans who were

arriving constantly from Cuba on the way to the United States

or to Mexico or to

somewhere else in the world, people who

were exiting Cuba.

Mexico did not break relations with Cuba as did the other

So, when the refugee flow dried up in Florida, we probably

had one of the most productive operations there in Mexico

City regarding information on what was going on in Cuba.

I spent a lot of time with AMSAIL on that.

because Mr.

Mr. Shaw, do you recall who delivered the photographs

Mr. Shaw. It was my understanding that the technician

picked them up. Bob Zambernardi would have picked them up

from the agent.

You are talking of the Cuban Embassy now?

Mr. Shaw. It is my understanding that he would have

picked them up from the agent who took the photographs. The

agent who took the photographs developed them, printed them,

and turned the prints over to Mr. Zambernardi. That is the way

I think it worked.

Mr. Goldsmith. How would you actually get to review the

But I would get a batch of photographs to go through.

Mr. Goldsmith. Who had reporting responsibility for

passing along the information that had been obtained from the

photographs and the transcripts?

Mr. Shaw. There was little reporting that came out of

the photographs. Usually, it yielded what we called operational

information rather than intelligence information, to enable us

to develop a better understanding of who was in the area, of

who was in the Cuban Embassy, and what they were up to.

As far as reporting intelligence that came from those,

it probably was reported by the reports section of the Embassy!

Next to Winn Scott's office was the CA Chief's office

and,

next to that -- I'm getting in the new embassy now. I don

not remember where the report section was in the old embassy.

We had reports officers who actually repaired most of the

reports from raw reports, if you will, reported by the case

officers.

Again, I would like to point out that these photographs

yielded very little reportable intelligence. It was mostly

operational intelligence.

Mr. Goldsmith. Understood.

Who was George Monroe?

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who retired or resigned,

Mr. Goldsmith. What was

Embassy?

Mr. Shaw. He was not at the Embassy then. He was at

the Embassy back in 1965.. I do not know, for a number of years.

At that time, Charlie had gone back to Headquarters and he

was involved in Cuban operations from Headquarters, the details

of which were not made known to me. Whether they were made

known to Winn Scott or Dave Phillips or others, I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. When would he have made an effort, if

he did, to recruit Teresa Proenza?

MI. Shaw.

I am not sure that he ever tried to recruit.

I am merely saying that he had a lot of interest. *I do not

think anybody ever tried to recruit her. If they did, they

were wasting their time.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why were they wasting their time?

Mr. Shaw.

She was a pretty tough nut. I never saw -- if

I canuremember -- I do not remember any vulnerability of

Mr. Goldsmith. When did he spend time in Mexico City that

Mr. Shaw. He visited Mexico City quite often.

Mr. Goldsmith. Even though he was not stationed down

there, he visited often?

Mr. Shaw. That is correct. He madé trips in and out of

Mexico City.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what Teresa Proenza's position

was at the Cuban Embassy or Consulate?

Mr. Shaw. I think by that time she was out of the Embassy,

was she not? I do not remember. She left.

Teresa Proenza was a Mexican. She was not a Cuban. And

"I am under the impression that by the time I got there,

i Teresa had left the Embassy. I may be wrong. I think that

she was involved in cultural activities.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether Mexican intelligence

would have had any penetration agents at the Cuban Embassy of

Mr. Shaw.

I think they would have tried. I do not know

how effective Mexican intelligence was. I did not deal with

it.

It would be assumed that they made every attempt, the

Cubans were gradually removing Mexicans from their employee,

from the Cuban Embassy. I think it highly unlikely that the

Mexican government, given its position, was the only government

in the Western Hemisphere which maintained relations with

them to have tried to pitch a Cuban national.

On the other hand, I think it would have been likely,

Mr. Goldsmith. Why do you make that distinction between

Mr. Shaw. I make that distinction because of the flap

i potential If the Mexicans had attempted to pitch a Cuban and

the Cuban had not accepted that pitch and had reported it

to his superiors, the Mexican Foreign Office then would have

had a problem with the Cuban Foreign Ministry.

Mr. Goldsmith. Of course, the Mexican government was

also taking a risk by being involved in the liaison operation

or the Agency as well.

MI. Shaw. One could assume that they had measured their

risk, yes, certainly. There is an element of risk in every

operation. Do not get me wrong. I do not know whether they

had anything going or not. I would assume, just based on my

experience, that they would not have tried to pitch Cubans,

Mr. Goldsmith. Who would have been in a position to know

Mr. Shaw.

"The chief or chiefs of the Mexican service or services.

Mr. Goldsmith. Any American?

Mr. Shaw. Not that I know of.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether there was any coordina-

tion between the telephone tap operations and the photo

operations.. For example, if a conversation of interest came

up on the tap operation, would the people monitoring the call

I be able to contact through an intermediary the photo bases

to warn them or indicate to them that someone is coming of

interest?

Mr. Shaw. It is my understanding that such a system did

not exist, and I do not believe that the quys monitoring the

telephone tap intercept bases were made aware of photograph

coverage.

However, I would assume that a man running a technical

operation, if he heard something exciting on the line, as

opposed to a tape several days later, would notify his case

officer right away and then it might be possible for the case

officer, assuming a quick reaction capability, to crank up

the people at the photo house to take pictures. This was in

the most perfect of all worlds. Usually things did not work

that way and you end up out on the street, in the middle of

the night two days later, contacting whoever it is taking

photographs.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether the Mexico City

station ever obtained a photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald?

Mr. Shaw. To my understanding, they did not. I never

saw anything down there that looked like Lee Harvey Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever hear an allegation that

...

Charlotte Bustos, at CIA Headquarters in Washington, found a

photograph of Oswald, or someone she thought to be Oswald,

in the Headquarters files shortly after the assassination?

Mr. Shaw. No, I have never heard such a story. Knowing

Charlotte -- not knowing her well, but having known her over

the years, I would assume that had she found such a thing

she would have rung a big loud bell and say, hey, look what

I found.

MI. Goldsmith. With regard to the photo operation, let

us assume for a moment that you come across a picture of

interest. Did you have any way of determining on what day and

approximately what time the picture would have been taken?

Mr. Shaw. Very definitely.

Mr. Goldsmith. How would you have done that?

Mr. Shaw. The photographs were squared off and were

annotated. We knew the day. We knew, usually, morning of

afternoon, a.m. or p.m. Sometimes you could judge by the

sequence.

Furthermore, sometimes the actual time of the person going

in and going out was actually annotated, if the person operating

was operating manually, he would no doubt, the guy with the

red-checkered Hawaiian

shirt went in at 10:05. He would note'

that in a little log.

I do not know whether he would note it on the photograph

or submit the log with the number keyed to the log in the

Mr. Goldsmith. Who would make the notations on the back of

Mr. Shaw. In our case, I believe it was the man taking

the photographs, printed them and turned them over.

I can't remember her married name.

And they said something about the police said it was Lee

Harvey Oswald, or something.

I do not remember. That was the

Mr. Goldsmith. I would like you now to take a look at

CIA No. 13 which is a transcript of the conversation allegedly

involving Oswald, a conversation taking place on 1 October '63.

not, but I may well have. I was aware that he had called the

Soviet Embassy, was made aware after the notoriety of the man

was established, but I do not recall ever seeing this before

that.

Normally, I would not.

Mr. Shaw. Yes, this is typical where they try to identify

somebody that was in the Embassy at the same time. Of course,

that does not sound like it.

Mr. Goldsmith. This was the famous cable that has given

rise to some of the issues that the Committee was concerned

with. My first question is, did you have anything to do with

the writing of this cable?

Mr. Shaw. No, I did not. I would not have had.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know how the photograph referred

to in paragraph number two of that cable was in some way linked

to Oswald?

Mr. Shaw. I would assume, my answer to your question is

I would assume that this was an effort on the patt of

the person drafting the cable to help Headquarters identify.

Lee Oswald, the man who had made the call.

Mx. Goldsmith. Do you know how she made that conclusion

that the photograph reflected Oswald?

Mr. Shaw.

No. I do not think she did. I think she

merely says that we got a guy who looks like he might be an

American going in, and maybe this is the fellow. I do not

see from this cable any conclusion that that is Oswald. I

rather suspect they never got a picture of Oswald. This is

the one that appeared there, that looked like it could be

an American. Therefore, an effort was made to help Headquarters

by saying a man who looked like he might be an American

entered the Soviet Embassy at that time.

Mr. Goldsmith. I agree with you, Mr. Shaw. Certainly,

the cable does not say that the photograph is a photograph of

Oswald. At the same time, though, it gives the information

in paragraph 1 on Oswald and the second paragraph makes a

reference to a photograph taken of someone who appears to be

North American.

Certainly they would not have sent to Headquarters simply

a cable indicating the existence of a photograph, so by putting

the photograph in paragraph 2 immediately below the information

1 Oswald, although the cable

does not say that the photograph

is one of Oswald, it does in some way suggest that they are

related.

Mr. Shaw. It suggests to me that they know an American

who claimed to be Lee Oswald called at a certain time, and

then they went to the photographs to see if they could find

anybody who looked like he might be an American, and the

photo they found was of a man apparently 35, athletic build,

about 6 feet tall, receding hair line and so forth; and they

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand your answer. I am hopeful

That is what it looks like to me.

Mr. Goldsmith. The fifth paragraph of that cable requests

that the station keep Headquarters advised of any further

contacts or positive identification of Oswald?

Yes.

the arrow it says "sic," s-i-c.

What do you think MI. Scott was intending to indicate

when he wrote "sic" next to the "Henry" in "Lee Henry Oswald"?

here subsequent to the assassination when the word came out it was

"Harvey Oswald" rather than "Henry Oswald" unless there is

something in here that says "Harvey." Is there any?

Mr. Goldsmith. Nö, there is none.

Mr. Shaw. I would imagine that is something he wrote

on later so that they would get the file in the right name.

wards, because I know Sylvia Duran was a person who had dealt

with Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. When was the first time. that this trans-

cript was linked to Oswald?

Mr. Shaw. I have no idea.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let us backstep for a moment. The

transcript that appears at CIA No. 13 contains a notation in

brackets by the transcriber that this is the same person who

called a day or so ago.

Mr. Shaw.

To the Soviet Embassy.

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes.

Oswald also said I was there last Saturday. The trans-

cript you just looked at, September 28th, was for a Saturday.

Do you recall whether anyone ever came to you and asked

you whether you were aware of a contact by Oswald?

Mr. Shaw. I do not recall that anybody ever came to me,

and I do not think that they did. This sounds familiar. I

would have heard about this after the assassination, because

I remember Sylvia Duran was the person being a Mexican citizen

inside the Cuban Embassy who I dealt with.

corner.

Mr. Shaw. My name appears there. However, it is not

crossed out. If you turn over a couple of pages, you will see

my initials on another thing which deals with the same period.

Mr. Goldsmith. I will do that in a minute.

Do you know whether this transcript was linked to Oswald

prior to the assassination?

Mr. Shaw. I do not know whether it was or not. I

gather it was not.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why is that?

MI. Shaw. It does not say. There is no mark on it,

Oswald on here anywhere.

Mr. Goldsmith. What are these numbers on the bottom

right-hand

Mr. Shaw. That is the file number.

Mr. Goldsmith. What file would that be?

Mr. Shaw. That says subject file. 50-8-10-6. I do not

know off-hand what that is. I think the 50 stands for

i Mexico.

8-10-6 would be a subject file.

Probably, possibly someplace where they putlinformation

on people where they are trying to travel to the soviet Union.

¡I do not know; that is a guess.

Mr. Goldsmith. Let's take a look at CIA No. 19.

Mr. Shaw.

Okay. CIA No. 19, 27 September, that looks

like my initial. It is very similar.

Mr. Goldsmith. In the upper right-hand corner?

Mr. Shaw. I cannot imagine anyone else putting it there.

Mr. Goldsmith. This is the conversation that took place

later in the day, is that correct?

MI. Shaw. 27 September 63, right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say that this conversation

took place sometime around 4:26 in the afternoon, according to

Mr. Shaw. There is an indication there.

Mr. Shaw. I havenno idea, because there is no date up

there. I do not know when it was circulated or anything.

Oswald?

Mr. Shaw. I do not.

Mr. Shaw. Not that I remember.

Mr. Goldsmith. At the bottom of CIA No. 19, it says

copy Oswald P-file. Essentially, do you know when that nota-

tion was put on?

MI. Shaw.

I do not know.

Mr. Goldsmith. Turning back to CIA-177, there is a

notation on the left-hand side of the page. It says, D:200-5-41.

Do you know what that would refer to?

Mr. Shaw. I have no idea what the D stands for. The

200-5-41 sounds like a file number.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know for what?

Mr. Shaw. No, I do not, but I would assume, again, that

maybe that would be - if it is in the 50 series, it would be

Mr. Goldsmith. This is a Headquarters

document.

MI. Shaw. That is a Headquarters file number. I have no

idea what the D stands for. It does not look right.

Mr. Goldsmith. I have asked this question before, but

for the record and purposes of clarification, I would like to

ask you again, to your knowledge, after the Mexico City sta-

tion received the cable from Headquarters dated October 10th

of 1lth, did the Mexico City Station ever send any additional

information concerning Oswald to Headquarters?

Mr. Shaw.

To my knowledge, they did not, but I would

have no way of knowing.

I do remember sending a message to Winn Scott suggesting

that, right after the assassination, that the Mexicans put in

a ring of quards around the Cuban Embassy and question everybody

going in and out. I remember that idea coming out of my

head.

Inknow that Sylvia Duran was arrested.. She was fair game

because she was a Mexican national and the Cubans - she did.

not have any Cuban diplomatic immunity.

I would have thought it would have been a good idea to

question here very closely. As to whether I said that she

should be arrested or I had anything to do with that, I do

not know.

I was perfectly capable of making such a suggestion.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why Headquarters was upset

about that arrest?

Mr. Shaw.

I have no idea.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know why Headquarters did not want

any Americans to confront

her or to interview her?

Mr. Shaw.

NO.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you have any reason to believe that

Oswald may have been an agent of the KGB?

MI. Shaw. I have no reason to believe it.

Mr. Goldsmith. How about an agent, asset or source of

the CIA?

Mr. Shaw. I would think that that would be completely

out of the question.

Mr. Goldsmith. For purposes of the record, could you

explain why you think that would be out of the question?

Mr. Shaw.

Because I thihk it would have come to light

immediately had he had any CIA connections.

Mr. Goldsmith. In what manner?

MI. Shaw.

Somebody would have revealed this fact.

Mr. Goldsmith. Had he been an agent of the CIA, asset or

employee, is it possible that someone would have been able to

cover that fact up?

Mr. Shaw. I do not think anyone could have covered up.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why not?

Mr. Shaw. Had he been an agent, then it would have been

on the record somewhere.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it possible that the record could have

been erased or-purged in some way?

Mr. Shaw. I seriously doubt it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Could you give a reason?

MI. Shaw. Just my belief in the integrity of the organiza-

tion. It stands on that, and the people in it.

Mr. Goldsmith.. Does the Agency, to your knowledge, have

¡any safeguards to prevent records from being erased or purged?

Mr. Shaw. Nowadays, of course, we have laws which say

I'you can't destroy material. I would say that the safeguards

again come back to the basic integrity of the people in the

organization. When you lose a President, you do not mess

I know I would have. I was a Kennedy man, and I imagine

there were a lot of us in the outfit who identified very

closely with the President.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever know anybody by the name of

Maurice Bishop?

Mr. Shaw. No.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether David Phillips, or

anyone else, ever used the name Maurice Bishop as an operational

alias of some kind?

Mr.. Shaw. I am not aware that they did, but I would

have to answer your question no. Dave Phillips does not seem

like a Maurice type, somehow.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did Headquarters ever criticize the

" Mexico City station in any way for its handling of the Oswald

matter prior to the assassination?

Mr. Shaw•

Not

that I am aware of.

Mr. Goläsmith. For that matter, after the assassination?

MI. Shaw.

Not that I am aware of. I must add that

criticism would have been conveyed to the Chief of Station

rather than to the case officers.

from the Soviet Union, would it have been standard operating

procedure for the Agency to have interviewed him or debriefed

him in some way?

Mr. Shaw. No. I think that it would have been more

likely for the FBI to interview him.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why is that?

Mr. Shaw. Because he was an American citizen in the

United States. That was the FBI's territory.

Mr. Goldsmith. Even though Oswald worked for several

years - not for several years, but for some time - in a

radio factory while he was in Russia?

Mr. Shaw.

I was not aware that he worked in a radio

factory, but the fact that he had been in the Soviet Union,

the fact that he had been in the United States Marine Corps,

would indicate to me that if he had been interviewed, he

would have been interviewed by the FBI.

Mr. Goldsmith. Does not the Agency have a Domestic

Contacts Division, or service, which customarily interviews

people who have been abroad in Communist countries?

Mr. Shaw. The Agency has the Domestic Contacts Division.

It used to be called 0/0 Contacts.

I never worked with those

people.

It is my understanding that what they do is routinely

debrief, if the person is willing, businessmen -- in the old

days, tourists - who had visited the Soviet Union, or to

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you have any knowledge of the opera-

Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Shaw, I would like to thank you for

your testimony today. I especially would. like to thank you

for spending all of this time with us. I know that you have

been here since approximately 3:00 o'clock or so and it is

now about 7:30. You have been very patient.

Customarily, whenever a witness testifies before the

Committee, the witness is given an opportunity to make a

statement for the record. This is not a hearing, but I would

like to give you the same opportunity, if you would like to

take advantage of it.

Mr. Shaw.

Well, I might take advantage of it. I had not

thought about it until you mentioned it, but harkening back

to what I said a little while ago, I do believe that our

organization was made up of, like Bill Colby has on the cover

of his book over there on the next table, of honorable men,

and I do not think that anyone in the organization would have

shed some light on the assassination of President Kennedy.

I might add a little vignette. We had what it called a

I book that the people signed when

they come to a funeral or something. You may have run into

something like this in the states, when you go in and sign

We had a book down in the lobby of the Embassy building

and when I came out one day shortly after the assassination

somebody in the crowd yelled Spanish for Bob, and I went over

a big state up in northwestern Mexico. I had known him some

years earlier.

He was the son of the General who was the

outstanding military leader of the Mexican Revolution from

about 1913 to about 1920.

His father had been President of Mexico... His father was

assassinated, having been elected to a second term. He was

already elected; he had not taken office.

I was profoundly touched by the presence of this son of

an assassinated President in the lobby of our Embassy to, in

turn, express his sorrow to us for the assassination of our

President.

That does not prove anything one way of another, but it

made a tremendous effect on me.

As

I mentioned very early in our session today, I am not

aware that there was any exultation, satisfaction, or happi-

ness inside the Cuban Embassy over the assassination of the

President. And I think, and my personal belief is, that

everything points to Lee Harvey Oswald having done it, and

done it alone.

There is nothing I have ever seen or heard which would

lead me to accept, for one moment, any complicity on the part

of my Agency or any other agency of the United States

government.

MI. Goldsmith. Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

I would like to add that as soon as the transcript of

this deposition is available, we will be in touch with you

so that you can have an opportunity to review it for accuracy

and again, I would like to thank you for your time and help

today.
