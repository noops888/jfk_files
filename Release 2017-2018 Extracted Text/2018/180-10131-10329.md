Have you had a chance to read that letter?

Mr. Goldsmith. I also would like to hand you the

Mr. Shaw. I understand it.

Mr. Shaw. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you waive that right to counsel?

Mr. Shaw. I do not need counsel.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do yourunderstand that, under the
Committee rules, that you have a right to receive a copy of 1

the statement: you.are going to give us at this deposition?

Mr. Shaw. I should hope so, to check it for accuracy. |

|
Mr. Goldsmith. However, by virtue of the arrangement
H

that the Committee has worked out with the Central Intelligence
i

Agency, we have been asked to request of Agency employees that
they waive their right to receive a copy of the deposition
for their own retention. By that, I mean we would certainly
be willing to grant you access to the deposition, to correct |
it in any way necessary, but the Agency has requested that

we ask you to waive your right to receive an actualy copy of
the deposition. H

Mr; Shaw. I have no problem with that.

Mx. Goldsmith. Thank you.

For the record, I would like to say that the Committee's

i
mandate is to investigate the assassination of the President. :

The scope of the mandate includes who killed the President,

Mr. Goldsmith. Would your State Department file, if
reviewed by a member of this Committee, indicate that you were
actually a CIA employee?

Mr. Shaw. I have no idea.

Mr. Goldsmith. You do not understand how the cover
arrangement would work between the Agency and the Department
of State?

Mr. Shaw.. I have never had anything to do with the
setting up of such cover, It would well be that there might
be some sort of an indicator or flag, or something in that
file that would indicate to a person who knew the ropes that
I was not bona fide.

Mr. Goldsmith. Would there be a personnel file on you
at the Central Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Shaw. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. As a matter of procédure, in terms of

how you get. paid, do you get paid by the Department of State?

Mr.:Shaw. No. Iam under, at the present time, nominal!

state cover. I actually, as. far as the Department of State
is concerned, resigned over there in 1973, I believe. At
the present time, I am paid by the Agency.

Mr.@Goldsmith. When you were working under cover, were
you being paid by State at that time?

and issued the passport to the American citizen concerned.

Mr. Shaw. Since August of 1976. Hl

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you have any responsibility in the
writing of the 1977 Inspector General Report pertaining to
the CIA's handling of the investigation of the Kennedy
assassination?

Mr, Shaw. None whatever.

-Mr. Goldsmith. Has anyone ever interviewed you before
pertaining to the Mexico City situation as far as it pertained |
to Oswald?

Mr. Shaw. Yes. It was about that time of '76, some-
body interviewed me in the CIA Headquarters building, and I

think it was a Senate Committee, but I amnnot sure. They had

some files. asset

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you give your testimony under oath
at that time?

{ Mr. Shaw. No, not that I remember.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did any CIA person ever interview you
concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City and
the operations of the Mexico City station?

Mr. Shaw.. I would have to qualify that. We discussed

the subject, of course, in Mexico City at the time of the

assassination, or immediately after the assassination. i

Mr. Shaw. From about the middle of April, I was serving

Mr. Shaw. Competence. It is difficult, because

comprehensiveness.

Mr. Shaw. I would say that he probably had one of the

most -- let me see -~ complete file systems in being in the

Agency. I think that he, my personal opinion is that he went

His tendency was not to rely on cross-indexing. If

you and you want to keep it and it has 15 names on it, he i

was quite capablé of setting up 15 files for the same piece

Let me’rephrase the question. Upon which individuals did he

Mr.. Shaw. He had one Deputy who-was Allen White. As
far as reliance on other people, I would say he relied very

heavily on Annie Goodpasture ~~ not in any way in a command

| FBI agent named George Monroe.
Mr. Goldsmith. What about David Phillips?
Mr. Shaw. Yes. Dave Phillips ran the what we called the

|| CA side of the shop, covert action, mostly propaganda. I came

{up the Cuban shop. Very soon after I arrived there, Dave

| Phillips was tapped -- it was while we were still in the old
|| Embassy building.

He was tapped and named the new Cuban Office Chief.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did that happen in October '63?

Mr. Shaw. I don't know. I do not remember. But it was
|not too long after I was there, and I was asked, I think by

| pave; I don't remember -- if I had any objections to continuing
' to serve in Cuba.

I liked Dave, I respected him. I did not feel that I
jwas being hurt, hurt careerwise, to step back and I was very

interested in Cuban operations, so I did willingly, let us say,

relinquish command, if you want to, of Cuban Ops and I served
Dave as one more officer.

Later on, after Dave left, a year or two later, I once
again took over the Cuban Ops group.

Mr. Goldsmith. You were in charge of Cuban Operations at

(the beginning. Then Phillips took it over at some point and

to Mexico City with the understanding that I was going to head

\then, after Phillips left, you went back to that position?

Mr. Goldsmith. Our review of Agency records indicates i

that Phillips would have assumed that position on October of

Mr. Goldsmith. My questions are going to be confined,

sidered myself to be one more case officer working against
the Cuban target. Our basic interest was in effecting pene-

of the Cuban Embassy, the Cuban Intelligence Service, and some:

Mr. Shaw. Did I?

Mr. Goldsmith. Did the station?

Mrs Shaw. There were two. I did not place either one,

jand I think they both pre-dated 1963.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were those two penetration agents within

the Cuban consulate or Embassy at the time of the President's

Mr. Shaw. Yes. One was in the consulate -- LITAMIL-7

Mx. Goldsmith. What were your primary responsibilities

for interrupting you.

Mr. Shaw. Go ahead.

: Mr. Goldsmith. You were not involved in the photo~

'tap operation, so,’ MY question is, what was your primary

responsibility?

Mr. Shaw. My primary responsibility was to try to

bit of time with Cubans of the non-Castro persuasion, attempt-
ing to identify Cubans of the Castro persuasion that we might
Igo after.

By "go after," I mean attempt to recruit.

I spent a lot of time collecting information from the

Mr. Shaw. One could assume that they had measured their

be able to-contact through an intermediary the photo bases

to warn them or indicate to them that someone is coming of

interest?

Mr. Shaw. It is my understanding that such a system did
not exist, and I do not believe that the guys monitoring the

| telephone tap intercept bases were made aware of photograph

' coverage.

However, I. would assume that a man running a technical

with Oswald.

Mr. Goldsmith. When was the first time that this trans-

Mr. Goldsmith. In other words, the point I was making
on the October lst transcript, it refers back to something
that happened a day or two earlier, possibly Saturday, and
I wondered if Herb Minnell, when they were discussing this,
came to you to discuss this matter?
Mr. Shaw. I do not believe they did. Barbara probably

would have processed this, but I do not recall that anybody

procedure for the Agency to have interviewed him or debriefed
him in some way?

Mr. Shaw. No. I think that it would have been more
likely for the FBI to interview him.

Mr. Goldsmith. Why is that?

Mr. Shaw. Because he was an American citizen in the
United States. That was the FBI's territory.

Mr.<Goldsmith. Even though Oswald worked for several
years -- not for several years, but for sometime -- in a
radio factory while he was in Russia?

Mr. Shaw. I was not aware that he worked in a radio

would have been interviewed by the FBI.
