THE PROBLIM IN SUMMARYS

1) The exile group wants finanoing from ua but wants to control thelr

menbors and pay $he.moembors,-.-- ~~

2) WAVE vanta us to control and pay the individual members and bag joined

the Lesue with the group.

3) ¥AVS recommended cutting off relations with the group unless thoy gone

to heel, Eowever, WAVE fears that the croup micht retaliate by publishing

some doa which the group hints at having snd vhich could cnbarrass us.

4) The proposal to enter the exile building 18 suggested in order to got

any incrirdnating
°

COMMENT: i

1) Action te for Seymour Bolten and George Ladner in their respective
fislds,

2) Obvious questions are

&) Yore ve trusting enough or sloppy enough to let the group get
docs which can-hurt us to any extent?

If. 904, vhy would they be tn the group building rather than in
@ number of other safe places, including homes of group leaders?

¢) Can'we find s solution which will avoid total animosity from
€voup menders and their friends among the exiles?

-4) Ie the probability of finding the docs, if they extet, strong
enough to merit the risk of the proposed breaking Job and possible bad
political consequences,not only from the exiles but fron sone U.S, types
who'd like to second guesses us?

e) Can ve mike token’ payment tarough the group to ite menbders to lot
the group leaders save face and still make our own arrangezente with such
Andiv{idual ne gem as aro worthwhile for ops of interest to us?
