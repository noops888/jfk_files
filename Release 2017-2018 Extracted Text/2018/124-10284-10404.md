On’ Oébober 23, 1959, our representative | in Havana he Bruretice
advised the United States Air Attache reported that the aircraft MK
dropping leaflets on October 21, 1959, were identified bya | 26-8
sergeant of his office as a B-25 and C47. No B-25 is known to
be in Cuba and only one is known to be in Florida. This is the \
property of Frank Anthony Sturgis, also known as Frank Fiorini. s
His plane was last based at North Perry Airport, Miami. The C-47
reportedly had yellow stripes painted on its tail. WNo aircraft so
marked was known to be based in Cuba. The planes flew over the
Hilton Hotel, headquarters of the American Society of Travel
eae haaid Convention, dropping leaflets. Their purpose allegedly
bas to show that thé present Cuban Government is incompetent to
maintain law and order. No bombs were dropped. There was no
 Gstrazing from the air, but some Cuban planes were damaged by
i misdirected Cuban Army and police ground fire.

An informant with whom insufficient contact has been
had to determine his reliability, on October 23, 1959, learned
that the Cuban Air Force had instructions to have two Fighters
ready to intercept any returning invaders. :

With reference to the B-25 mentioned above, our Miami
Office advised on October 23, 1959, that the B-25 flown by
Diaz Lanz, according to Diaz Lanz, was owned by Sturgis. Wiami ig
sources had no information concerning the C-47. United States
Border Patrol representatives in Miami advised that there were
very few C-47's in the Miami area and none were knoum to have
gone to Havana on October 21, 1959. The Border Patrol] suspects }
that the C-47 mentioned above is based in Mexico but has no |

On October 24, 1959, a source who is in a position to
furnish reliable information advised that at about 3:15 pemey
October 24, 1959, Jose Ramos, Vice Consul acting in charge of
the Cuban Consulate, Miami, stated that the Cuban Government
wanted to file extradition proceedings immediately against a
Cuban exile in Miami. The informant surmised that the subject
of the extradition proceedings would be Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz.

October 24, 1959.

It is noted that the press on October 25, 1959, reported
that Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa publicly stated that the Cuban
Government was asking the United States for the provisional arrest
of Diaz Lanz and would request his extradition. In this connection
the above source, on October 25, 1959, advised that Ramos had ,
consulted an attorney in Miami and had brought data alleging two
charges against Diaz Lanz. The first charged Diaz Lanz with murder
and the second charged him with attempted murder and were based on.
two cases, allegedly pending in Havana. The first case allegedly
is pending in the Fourth District, Court of Instructions, Case
Wumber 4452. The second case is allegedly pending in the Sixth |
District, Court of Instructions, Case Number 3007. Reportedly,
the Court_of Instructions is similar to a magistrate's court where
original complaints are filed. No dates or details were furnished
by Ramos covering the circumstances surrounding the alleged
offenses. The attorney reportedly drew up the necessary extra~
dition papers including a warrant for the arrest of Diaz Lanz.

a However, the attorney is uncertain as to whether he should continue.
with this matter since it is obviously a device seeking to eee
Diaz Lanz to Cuba for political reasonse

On October 24, 1959, the informant mene eonee on page
two of the enclosure to the referenced communication and who has
furnished reliable information in the past reported that a leaflet
in the ‘Spanish language was being distributed in the Cuban colony '
in Miami» The recipients of the leaflet were invited to attend a
meeting at 8 peme, October 25, 1959, at the Circulo Cubano (Cuban
Circle), Miami, Florida, a social club, to protest and condemn
the activities which occurred over Havana on October 21, 1959.
It was indicated in the leaflets that the meeting was being
sponsored by the July 26 Movement (Castro's movement), Miami. The
informant learned. that individuals representing various anti-castro|
groups in Miami were planning to attend the meeting, some of whom
indicated they would carry guns, thus giving rise to bloodshed
between the pro~ and anti-Castro factions. The Miami Police
Department and the Dade County Department of Public Safety have
been notified and these agencies plan to take whatever steps are

necessary to insure that no violence will be carried out. fe
The informant mentioned in the foregoing paragraph
iH learned that, because of the furor raised in Cuba during the |
‘ past-few days, the air sabotage which had been scheduled to

It was also furnished to Major Cyrus Timmons, Department
of the Air Force; Major Gains Hawkins, Department of the Army;
and Lieutenant Commander Francis T. Reardon, Department of the
Navy, by Mr. C. B. Peck of this Bureau and to Mr. Chester A. Emerick,
Bureau of Customs, by Mr. J. F. Wacks of this Bureau. All the
disseminations were made on October 24, 1959.

On October 23, 1959, Deputy Al Tarabochia, Public Safety
Department, Dade County, Miami, advised our Miami Office that Jose
Ramos, Vice Consul, acting in charge, Cuban Consulate, Miami,
claimed to have received information from a source whose reliability
is unknoum that a two-engine gray airplane was scheduled to drop
leaflets and probably bombs over Havana on October 24, 1959, and
that possibly Diaz Lanz or his plane would be involved. Reportedly
the same plane was to fly over Havana on October 26, 1959, and drop
leaflets and generally try to disrupt a large Castro rally planned
for October 26; 1959. Diaz Lanz, according to Ramos, may fly the
leaflet-dropping mission on October 26, 1959. The United States
Border Patrol and United States Customs in Miami were advised.
These data were orally furnished to Mr. Charles Hammond, Department
of State; Major Cobb, Department of the Army; Commander R. Lyon,
Department of the i in.D. K. Harrelson, Department of the
Air Force; and Se ey ome Be the Central Intelligence Agency
by Mr. Jo Je O'CO reau on October 24, 1959.

On October 25, 1959, our Miami Office advised that on
October 24, 1959, Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz; his brother, Marcos Diaz
Lanz, former Inspector General and.Pedro's assistant in the Cuban
Air Force; Ricardo Lorie Valls, former July 26 Movement under-
ground leader in Miami; Frank Anthony Sturgis, also known as
Frank Fiorini, a United States citizen and former underground
member of the July 26 Movement in Miami; and Carlos Echogoyen,
former member of the Cuban Air Force, were interviewed.

Pedro Diaz Lanz. confirmed the data he furnished on
October 22, 1959. He stated in addition that the leaflet-dropping
flight of October 21, 1959, was a joint enterprise of the above~
named persons under his leadership in behalf of the July 26 Anti-
Communist Movement, but without the specific knowledge of the
movement. Diaz Lanz stated he planned the incident. The receipt
of the data concerning the arrest of Hubert Matos, Castro
military leader in Camaguey, caused Diaz Lanz to move up the date
and change the target from Camaguey to Havana. The purpose of the

An informant who has furnished reliable information in
the past has provided the following datas: In September,’ 1959, the -
informant learned that. Fernando Coba, a Cuban police sergeant in
Havana, had_been given $1,000 by his chief, Efigenio Almejeiras,
for his part in enticing Rafae] del Pino to Cuba from the United
States. It is noted that Del Pine, a publicly admitted anti~Castro
leader in Miami, was seized by Cuban authorities on July 25, 19595

\ The above-mentioned informant has also learned that
Almejetras was attempting to find someone who would lead an armed
L00-man expedition to Cuba from Miami and then turn the members
of the expedition over to Cuban authorities in much the same fashion
as William Alexander Morgan, American soldier of fortune, and Castro
official, had done in August, 1959, when he acted as,a double |
agent for Castro in exposing a plot against Castro from bases in
the Dominican Republic. According to the informant, Raul Castro,
newly named minister of the Cuban armed forces, approved of this
venture and was greatly interested in seeing it carried oute
Reportedly Raul Castro and Almejeiras expressed an interest in i
