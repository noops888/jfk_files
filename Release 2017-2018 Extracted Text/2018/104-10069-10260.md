2. We have been in recent contact with Edward Scannell’ Butler, Executive

Vice President and Staff Director, and have received his assurances of whole-
hearted cooperation in our agency's mission. (Yesterday we examined all of the
files of correspondence between Hr. Butler and personnel of various radio-
stations in 16 Latin American countries.| In order to build up a market for
the Truth Tapes program in Latin America, Mr. Butler first obtained from the
appropriate cansul in New Orleans a list of the radio stations in operatisn in
his country. He next wrote the administrative personnel of these stations
about the anti-Communist purpose of INCA and offered to supply each station
with Truth Tapes. Those stations requesting them were then provided with a
series of the tapes. One or two years later, Mr. Sutter sent the participating
station a questionnaire designed to elicit information. about audience response
to the Truth Tapes program, Copies of the first questionnaire and of a revised
one are attached for your information. Judging by the responses we read, the
INCA correspondence files will provide a limited amount of information, dated
ijo4 and 1355, on the identification of radio stations in Latin America which
are broadcasting Truth Tapes, their addresses, the names of key personnel, the
atification of stations not respan: offer, sizes of sudiences,

Rutter mentioned yester

re, he would welcone o tions about addit

gned to eli nical information about ‘the station
and its equipment, such as descriptions (manufacturer, type, model) of trans-
mitter, receiver, antenna type and power, frequencies and frequency range, reli-
ability of equipment, normal and emergency power sources, remote pick-up arrange-
ments, etc. We stressed of course that none of these topics should be introduced
into the questionnaire unless Mr. Butler was convinced of their suitability for
his immediate purpose as well as for the long-temn propaganda aim of his organi-
zation. He stated that our suzgestions were entireiy proper and, in his opinion,
were reasonable requests that would not arouse the station manager's curiosity.
We pointed out to Mr. Butler that, while Information /about key personnel and
their political orientation) about the statlon'’s administrative policies, etc.,
was of prime importance tous, these subjects obviously could not be introduced

into the questtonnaire. He agreed that It would be be r_to elicit such infor~
mation in another manner, as he had done wit Pout because
of his very heavy responsibilities, he did not me-to-develop similar

sources of information in each of the other 15 countries.

4, tt occurs to us that you or a possible consumer could assist us by
suggesting other appropriate topics for Mr. Butler's consideration in the revision
of the questionnaire. We shall appreciate whatever help you can give us In this
regard.

5. $n the meantime, as soon as all of Mr. Butler's current correspondence

has been properly filed, we expect ta extract the upprooriate information from
the folders and to present the material in a series of 09-3 reports.
