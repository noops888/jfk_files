OSWALD

1.

Much has been written about the delay (by the Mexico

Station) ins ending the first cable reques ting traces

on the

name Lee OSWALD.

It was dis cussed in Dave Phillips

book as

case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (wich

in my

view was

unjust and unnecess ary

• and indicates that Dave

didn't know what he

was talking about).

Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October

convers ation

would have been picked up on

the morning of. the

2nd of October.

The Russian language portion

would have gone

to the Russ ian/English transcriber on the 3rd

trans lation would have

been returned the following day

(4th )

at hich time,

the Soviet case officer would have as ked for

the photographic coverage.

That coverage nuld not have been

day which would have been Marr

Coctober.

Later the film was

aken out of the camera every

but at that time,

the film stayed in the camera until a

roil was completed which might take three or four days.

4. A name trace could have been reques ted on

the bas is

of the name alone

but that wasn't the way

Win Scott ran that

Station.

He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with

the

teleph one coverage

• sometimes there was..a U.S. automobile

licers e number.

It

was also part of the "numbers

game" of

justifying a project by the number of dis patches, cables or

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

inited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had

sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of' that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bi

e middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of th

gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

Esthe Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

arden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel.

The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED

and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral mai

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wish Tell, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control.. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, becane the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

conversations of interest which were then included in

a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag

of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

Station started screening all photographs. However, here agado,

• were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

team and a mail intercept operation.

The number of lines

taped was linted by avallability of a listening post zearty

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech,

etc)

transcribers. Generally

those agents (nostly 0 l

for Mexican American) were related

(which the sle

that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites were handled by Arderson with the help

of Harry Vahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA). LITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet time vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Ramon Alvarez Mexican citizen of U.S. nother who taught elecentary level at

the American School). Ranon collected the film pellentmisti

for Ramon's brother-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus Ranon became

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez lateos. During this period, the J.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn". One of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former lexi President), acting

for Lopez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIEVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.

The Mexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

2 Polish, and 1 Iugoslav line. The basehouse listening

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which rad

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manall and his wife Berbera

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an American. However, here again there was a backlag because the

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat

a call was made to the

first listing for the Sovzet. Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned out to be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN)

who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

Short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call. DURAN gives her nane and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

SILVIA DURAN, ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION STILL PUZZLES US-

WHEN LEE

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTIMBER AREARLY OGTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBAN ERI

NSIT VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL.

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT.

20 PLEASE RESTUDY POUR LIENVOY MATERIAL AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION,

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including

some.

from the White House Staff, have revealed that,

though CIA and

the

FEL have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DCID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans shose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition rould not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and It would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand thia list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh So Cumming,

Jr.

had apperently visited the Cuban Inisany and its Consular offices

on a number of occasions and he correctly identified some twenty

Cuban Embassy and Consular employees.

showed that OSWAID could not possibly have been in Vesica
