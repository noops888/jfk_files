SU"JECT: "elay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the delay (ty. the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book a a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in wy view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was’ talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October
convers ation would have been picked up on the morning-~6' e
2nd of October. ‘The Russian language portion would:have\gone
to the Russ ian/English transcriber on the 3rd ofeOttober. ‘the
trans lation would have been returned the follawing:.day (4th)
at which time, the Soviet case officer wyhd haves ked for
the photographic coverage. ‘hat coverage wuld not have been
in the station before the 7th since tha ‘fijm was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and ‘picked up probably on
the 4th, processed and passed ation on the next work
day which would have been M Ictober.

3. . Later the film was en out of the camera every da
but at that time, the filmstayed in the camera until a full
rotl was completed which might take three or four das.

4. A name trace could have been requested on the bas is
of the name alone but that wasn't the way Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage ..s ometimes_there_was..a U.S..automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of
jus tify ing a project ly the number of dis patches, cables or
Teports produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage: we |
From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 uneit
2 the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
" "Mexico City. This umbrella type project (upstaged of multiline

telephone company wi ‘ed by a Station case officer. The number {

of lines tapped wa! ted only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
; Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
- American recruited agents.
‘ Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer
: assisted: by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southéast corner of’ that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site wee middle of .
> the block south. It had a planted view of t! ger the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photogra as : located in one of a
row of four houses on the ming Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked th ykden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this iS is to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed. by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

foreigners. Their agents were sieceTal | and corrupt. A Station
officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In
1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-
cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post.

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa heyé{in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly this man
(the American), ~: showed him a letter imwhich:he”(the
American) is a member of an organizatiéh in favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not ¢ive*

et ‘the visa without
the Russian visa and now the Seyiet sn't know what to do
with him, because he has Wa the answer from
Washington. we Ws
DURAN: .,with them also, begaljSa'tip problem with him (the Anerican)
is that he doesnigAgmysanyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very diféj give him a visa, because he was
thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take wlong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.
SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were
~" now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is’ going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.
DURAN: conan and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.
SOVIET: They can only give the visa according to instructions.
DURAN: | Then that is what she will put on his application.
SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
T don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.
DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

‘An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Enbassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

Just after 1600 hours, ‘the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her, name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPIBEER ‘oreany OCTOBER TO

GET A SOVIET’VISA AND A cusave tas we, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL
TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, oR ‘AVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST
AND THEN LEAVE LATER. ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK
ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENTe

Dear Dick: a

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some
“from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the
FHL have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited
as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be 5 oe,

‘a complete listing of thosc Americans now living in Bloc countries ale
who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCD /2, °: i"
these. porsons might be described as those who have either been ae
capable of providing useful intelligencé to the Bloc or those whose
gesire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited -/
for communist propaganda purposes. ‘Tais would mean that no attention
need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular +. :
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual ; ne
US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the
homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into
/ the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18
months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
possibly expand this List for the use of interested Bureaus ofthe a
Departwents mee ec
