This source also reported that IRVING

PEARLMAN, a dealer in dice games, arrived in Miami

Vegas, Nevada, stayed less than a week,

then went to Freeport, where he reportedly will be

a dice dealer and one

of the few American employees.

MICHAEL MCLANEY, PCI, advised DINO CELLINI

MM 166-1 will be one of

supervisors in this

casino.

CELLINI, he learned, operated the schoot in

London, England, where gambling instructions were issuea

to prospective employees.

He also reported that the

Bahamian law does not permit coin operated machines,

where more than two coins are returned and as a

result no slot machines will be located in the gambling

casino.

MM 509-C-TE reported that RUTH GASSENHEIMER,

co-owner of the

Patio Bridge Club, Miami Beach, is

generally disliked by the bookmakers and gamblers,

but due to the fact that there are very few hangouts

avallable for the card sharks, bookmakers, gamblers, etc.,

to hang out, her place has been overflowing at night.

As a result

of the increased activity and because there

are generally 25 to 35 persons who watch a card game

and bet anywhere from $10.00 to $200.00 a game,

themselves, she has

started to charge all those

who bet

on card games a fee of $1.50 per game, which 1s the regular

card fee for those who play in the game.
