base by radio on 31 December 1964, but no message was ever received,
Plans called for another group of about seven men to infiltrate into
Cuba at Baracoa on or before 40 January 1665, The group left the
Dominican Republic on 20 January according to plan. Near the Cuban
coast, they were pursued by three Cuban patrol boats and one airplans
but managed to escape, The boat used in both infiltration attempts
was called the “Betrand" which may moan a Bortram boat.

3. AMRAZZ-1 reported on 1 February that be had spoke on 31 Jan
1965 to Reynaldo ABREU in charge of GUTIZBREZ' affairs in Miami who

Dominican Republic by telephone on 30 January 1965, VAZCUEZ stated
he could not come to Miani at that time as he was taking charge of
@issantliog the base there, Be also needed about $10,000.00 to clear
up back bills owed by the group. However, on 3 February 1965, AMDELL=-1

members of GUTIERREZ’ group in the Dominican Republic intended to go
akead with the plan to infiltrate Cuba. To his knowledge a leader had
