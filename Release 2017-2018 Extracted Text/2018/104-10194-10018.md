uo} Cuban Oil Raid

THE SUPPRESSED STONY
can now be teid of how the
Central Intellizence Agency
organized 2 Cudaa exile raid
fon Cuba's key oil refinery in
1963 but aborted It after the
aswassination of President
Kennedy.

to recover their property in

We have learned the dra
matic details from Bradley
Ayer, a S6yczrold” former

‘Atmy" captain, who was se-
fected by the CIA to train
Cuban exiles for infiltration
and aseault missions Includ-
Ing the refinery fald in Ma-
tanzas province.

We, have checked out
Ayers’ story with our own
Sources, who confirm he is
correct about names, places
and dates. From a group of
pictures, Ayers aso wes able
to pick out finmediarely a
CIA undercover operative
who we knew had been In+
Yoived in the CIA ralds
against Cuba.

"The rugged Ayers, a for-
mer Army ranzer Instructor,

Ayers, “were bank ‘clerks,
pushers, walters, musicians,
laborers, men who had Ged
to the United States. Many
had never fired a weapon.
They were disorganized and
undisciplined. I got the job
of reorganizing the training
program.”
