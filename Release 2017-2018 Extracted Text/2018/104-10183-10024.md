numerous new friends I gathered from Subject that he was a
bit too much in this°direction to suit gw his (Subject's) tastes,
but that he saat celica) for the abijity to pull off these
stunts, Subject inferred that boceue lis a short,

slight maa, he felt obliged to act in ner. His personality
is pleasant, however, and is apparently a good mixer on the
cocktail circuit. He speaks French, Spanish, end English, all
very well. He is able still to return to Cuba for, 106
should this be found desirable. Subject felt vane pbaes
money at the present time, a factor to be consider

recruitment pitch, Whether or not his dissatisfaction with

Castro would be any incentive for his cooperating with KUBARK

is problimatical, probably negative. Money, and perhaps the
adventure of the proposition would be the strongest motivations.

The rest of the inform ded by Subject at this meeting
is already reflected i file.

KUBARK, we did not press for details, but told AMWHIP/1 that
we would check the matter. (Upon consulting with jae it was
