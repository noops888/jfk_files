that Mr. Hunt was referred to his office for placement

assistance through the Office of the Executive Director,

then Colonel L. K. White.

Mr. O'Mallay stated that in

view of Mr.. Hunt's interests

in the public relations

field, it was thought advisable to put Mr. Hunt in touch

after the initial neeting, Mr. Mullen mentioned having

met Mr. Hunt

some years previously in Paris, France.

organizations including Readei's Digest and the Kennacoit

Copper Company. Through the offices of the Muilen Company

disappointment that ir. Hunt had been unsuccessful in

"selling hinself" during any of these interviews and that

no job offers had resulted.

io whether or not executive level interest was still

being

shown in Mi. Hunt's posi-enployment placement,

Mr. O'Palley recalled that ir. Richard Heins, then

Director of Central Intelligence, was listed as a charac-

ter reference on Mr. Hunt's resume and that Mr. Helms

signed a letter of recommendation to the Kennecott Copper

basis, becaus ir. O'Malley was interesis in dit. Hurt

for possible referral of other agency rctirees.

MT.

mercial Stest interest in the Mullen Conpany, and that

Mir. Huni became instrumental in discussing several aspecis

of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of

the company. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various

Agency officers to Mir. Hunt for guidance when these indi-

viduals expressed an interest in entering the public.

in feeling Mir. Hunt had generally been less helpful on

these occasions.

5.

Mr. Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several occasions.

requesting referral of retiring ligency enployees with

specific qualifications. These instances occurred apparent-

ly after Mr. Hunt had assuned his responsibilities vith

the White House.

In one

instance Mr. Hunt requested re-

: fertal of a recently retired Agency secretary.. As in

previous memoranda and ciscussions, ix. O'Malley was unabic

¿o recail the name of this

individual: He did, however,

state thai he is quite certain Mi. Hunt turned down the

she previously worked

for hin in any capacity. Mi. C'"alley also recalled a

request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having skills in

O'Malley occalied that Mr. Hunt expressed dissatisfaction

with that suggestion in part boccuse of tai tr..

fieved as that firm's political

oriontation.

Mir- O'Dalley

did not elaborate further on that renars.

Hi. O'Malley

then suggested the use of anderson security consultanes,

incorporated, l

the Offica oi

security.

Mr. O'Malley stated thai insofax as this

organization was advertised in the yello: pages ind that

Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the sei-

vices, he feli this to be a reasonable suggestion.

tiT-

O'Malley stated that during a subsequent phone call wen

vir. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worked out,

MI. Hunt responded,

"Yes, they had done a fine job."

At this point Mr. O'Malley was asked whether of not iron

his associations

with Mx. Hunt he felt Mir. Hunt was in

the habit of making glib connents which were not neces-

sarily accurate in oider to pass over a subject Mr.

O'Malley stated that this was categorically so. He said

he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied io hin on a numbet of

occasions and that, therefore, he was in no position to

be sure that Mr. Hunt had actuaily,

in faci, used the

services of Anderson Security Consultants.

Mr. O'Nalley

volunteered the opinion thai he suspected the electronic

counterneasures "sweep" was to be carried out in the citices

of the Conmittee io Re-elect the President-

7.

In response to a question as to whether he had

ever referred anyone to McCord

Associates, Mr. O'valley,

replied thai ha remembered having referred Walter Brayden.

MIT.

Brayden for a tine acied as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha

Mitchell.

As an aside Mir.. O'Malley mentioned that Mr:

Brayden had refused to carry a firearm in spile of the

fact that vir. NcCord told him he could do so on the author-

ity of the Attorney General. Asked specifically if he hau

ever referred

either Willian Shea or Teresa Shea

to Mr.

ricCord, Mi. O'Malley stated that he did not recall specie-

ically referring Teresa Shea and thai he was sure that he

had not referred Willian Shea to hin..

So, contrary to

previous statenents, it is now vir. O'Pialley's belief that

in all probability Mrs. Shea was not referred by this

Agency to Mr. McCord.
