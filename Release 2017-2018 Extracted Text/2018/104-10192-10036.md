On 8 April 1965, Mike Rafferty, an associate of Bill Johnson,
an American pilot who arranges the support aspects of bombing
missions for Orlando Bosch Avila's Movimiento Insurreccional de
Recuporacion Revolucionaria’ (HIRR, Inmsurrectioual Movemon. for -
Revolutionary Rocovery), said that Bosch claimed to have beea in
touch with Molvin Hayes, a pilot from Arkansas who has been en=
gagod in crop dusting, On 8 April Frank Swanner, s friend of.
Hayes, allegedly told Bill Johnson that ho had reecived a phone
call from Rayes from Avkansas saying that ee hee would be in the
Miami area within a week,

Rafferty said he bolioves that Hayes’ arrival in Miamt is related:
to plans for a raid on a Cuban sugar mill, Bosch has temporarily
discarded his plan to use.a B-26 in a bombing mission of Habana
because of tho high cost of such an operation, However, Bosci
bas raised enough monay to finance the bombing of a sugar mill.

Contacts betwoon Hayes and Bosch’ are handled through "Mino," a
Cuban exile who had been manufacturing bomba for Bosch's raids,
"Mimo" ig believed, to reside in the general area of NW 19th
Avenuo and 31st Streot, Miauwi,t

Hayes first becamo axysociated with.Bosch through Frank Svannor,
a fellow crop dustor., Swanmer had advised ilayes that there was
money to be mado in tho Cuban raid business,

Rifforty has alleged that Hayes piloted the plane which made
the air strike over the Niagara sugar mill in northemPinar

del Rio Provinco-on 17 January 1968, Hayes rented an aircraft
in Orlando and flew to Immokaleo, Florida, noar Naples, whore
ho knows a man who owns a motol close to a landing strip, The
strip is equipped with night-landing lights but no tower,

Thore thd plane was rofucled and loaded with bombs supplied by

"Mimo," It then took off for Cuba,

‘The. MIRR's 12 - 13 February raid of the Bahia Honda sugar mill,
also in Pinar del Rio Province, was handled directly between
Hayes and Bosch, -Johngon was eliminated when Hayes reported
Johnson's failure to turn over all of Hayes’ fee. for the Niagara
raid. . Hayes was supposed to receive $600 in advance, $1,000
after the flight, to be followed by anothor $1,000, Bosch gave
Johnson $700 to cover Hayes and an additional $100 for expenses,
Of this, Johnson gave Hayes only $300 and kept the rest. When
Hayes informdd Bosch tmt he bad only received $300, Bosch paid
bim $1,000 and arranged for the second flight which took place

without Johnson's knowledge.

Hayes is divorced from his first wife but is in tho process of
re-marrying her. He and his ex-wife are from Brinkley, Arkansas,
Hayes, who has been working as a crop duster for Roddel (fnu)

in Arkansas,’ was recently jailed for using his employer's credit
card, He was later released when he agreed to pay or work off

the debt,

A Texan named Dennis Overstreet, who claims to know Hayes since
childhood, said that Hayes is a tough customer who would traffic
in.anything. He is a very good pilot and can fly a B-26,

Field Comments:

"Mimo" may be identical with Daniel Orlando Ramirez Denis,
an explosives specialist, ornare

This is probably Carl Riddel of Riddel's Flying Service,
