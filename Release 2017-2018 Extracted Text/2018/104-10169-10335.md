functioning a3 an actual Vice consul, Costille recalls tat omof Urigorly Yeo
GOLUB's chief complaints when h» was consul was that he was overworsed as the

Phoned Costille on official consular business. He was very friendly on tie. paces
and stated that he hoped Costille and he could mest soon,

2. At the 20 December function, Costille and KLIAOV were part of about 40
Consular Corps manbers touring the AGA factory in Helsinci, a Finnish subsidiary
of a Swedish company making beacon liphts, television sets, etc, after a short
while Costille was introduced to. KLIMV, and later quite by coincidence the two
sat next to one anothur at lunch, following the luncu Uostille offered to drive

XLINOV back to the Joviet smbasay, Cu the trip to the Subassy Costille suggested

the two stop for coffee and cognic at a nearby restaurant, to which KLINOV reably
agreed. .

3. Bhographic information: KLINOV. appears to be. in the neighborhood of 35.
years old, spesks alow but goo! Uislish, fe -is approximately 5'9® tall, stocky
‘but not stout, has a broad face and brom cair, (He does not presently have a
moustache, althourh the RSUCAI Notabock picture shows him with one.) He has @
Pleasant face with a natural amile, le is friendly, polite, soft spoken, but
gives the impression of Leing q-ite sure of himself. His personality svewa to be
just the opposite from his superior in the Consula’ , vonsul Ivan Yerimovioh
SERCEYEV. SERGLYSV waa not present at this particular fiction, but Lostille
has met him once cr twice at previous Consular Corps functions. SSeGsY.V is
polite but has never shown any aigns of friendliness. He is somoxiat pompous
and frankly a cold fish, KLINOV atated that he (KLINOV) was from Noscow,. (Coss
taille is not sért.dn if he was born there.) He waa educated at tv University
of Moscow and lis stated that nia major subject was the United Stales, KLINOY
is married—and he made a point of telling Costille that he is quite happily
marriedeeand has ona duughter about eight years old, The dsughter is in sbhvel
in the Soviet Union; however, she occasionally visits Helsinki. At the Consular
Corps luncheon KLLii0V appeared to enjoy himself, was friendly to everyone, and
made & point of shaking everyone! s hand upon his departure,

4, When Coatille and KLINOV were alone in the bar, KLINOV fairly quickly
burned the conversation to a comparison of soviet and Western systems. ilowver,
at all times he remained polite and Listened closely to costille's slide of the
discussion, KLIWOV started the conve tution by stating that he thought Mniche
life" (i.e, nivht oluba, duneing,. atc.) was-a waste of tixe and tilat he paraonalir
preferred reading and the arta, lio et ited that in the United States thers suaned

Union had any control over tne satellite countkies. KLUGY criticized american
jazz, rovies, Juvenile deling-ency, etc. .aituougi wuite definite in ais om
baliers, *Lin'V listened attentively to wat Costiile haa to say and took eriticiszs
of his own country in striue. as tne two were leaving tie restaurant, KLINOV
told Costilis that in answer to Costille's earlier auestion on the availability
of Nestern literature in the Soviet Union he could only state that ie did not

as mucn access during nis studies as ue wuld have iiked.

5e Costille received the impression that Helsinki was Xlinov's first post
and probably the first time ne nud bean out of tue Soviet union, He repeated
a number. of cimes during the conversation his fondness for coscow and that he
found Helsinid to be lacking in cultural life. He appeared to be ajpreciative
for tne ride back to the cubassy and upon departing told Costille how much he
enjoyed the ufternoon and hoped that they cight meet again. about two days
before Chtistmas «LIMOV sent via a Soviet imbassy chauffeur two bottles of soviet
vodka to Ccotille's apartment with a lew Year's card attached.

6 Nothing further was heard from KLUOV until 3 Karch. At this time he
Phoned Coatille to ask if Costille could obtain two tickets to the premiere of

“Bon Hur® for him and hia wife. This was impossible and Costille told him he
would try for tickets at a later date,

7. He, Amon HWYOHANAN, Vice Consul at the Israeli Legation, told Costille
that shortly after the first of the year KLIMOV piioned him and asked him to have
& drink and dinner sous evening after work: B&i-YOHANAN had also met KLINOV at
the same Consular Corps function. During the evening aLIsOV told Ba-YOHANAN
that algthough not Jewish himself, he had a number of Jewish friends in roacow.
KLIMOV’ etoted that wreatly aduired Jewish people for their intellect. ‘The
two had dinner at a local night club, the Klaus Kurki, which catera to young
Finnish girls who come alone on the prowl. HSV-JOHANAN suggested that he and
KLOV spot two likely prospect and ask them to dance. KLINOV became quite
embarrassed and said that he had rather not as-his wife was quite jealous.
BS/=YOHANAN ‘remarked that his wife would never rind out if KLIAOY Just. danced
wath the girl, However, KLIOV atill refusod stating that his wife sonenow
could just "feel when he had even danced wita another girl,"

&. It will be noted that KLIMOV is listed on the latest Diplomatic Corps

List as an attache, However, he was introduced at the Consular Corps as the
"new Soviet Vice Consul",
