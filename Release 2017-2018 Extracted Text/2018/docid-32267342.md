GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF HEARING

This first session with Marcello has the

limited purpose of obtaining Marcello's direct testimony

in each of the areas in which he may have been involved

or of which he may have knowledge. No detailed cross-

examination will be attempted. If deemed appropriate,

Marcello's answers will then be tested by further

investigation over the course of the next six months.

At that time, Marcello may be recalled to probe the

veracity and accuracy of his testimony at the first

session.

GENERAL BACKGROUND ON CARLOS MARCELLO

Carlos Marcello is reputed to be, as he was at

the time of both the Kennedy and King assassinations,

the head of organized crime in the New Orleans area.

The bulk of Marcello's income during the period of the

assassination derived from gambling and real estate

investments. Marcello is also alleged to have had

substantial control over state and local government

officials in Louisiana. A number of law enforcement

officers in Jefferson

Parish are considered to be on

his payroll.

DocId:32267342 Page 7

---

## Page 8

=2..

Marcello was born on February 6, 1910 at Tunis,

Africa.

The failure of his parents to have Carlos

naturalized when they arrived in New Orleans on October 11,

1910 has left Marcello vulnerable to possible deportation,

a battle he has been fighting since 1952. Marcello grew

up in Jefferson Parish, on the outskirts of New Orleans,.

as a petty hoodlum. He was convicted of assault and

robbery in 1929 and of the sale of marijuana in

1938.

Since that time, Marcello has not been convicted of a

crime except for 1968 when he was convicted of assaulting

an FBI agent.

It has been alleged that Marcello received his

first opportunities in organized crime from Meyer Lansky,

who gave him a percentage of the slot machines in New

Orleans. In the forties, Marcello used the Jefferson

Music Co. as a front for handling the distribution of

slot and pinball machines. Along with Mafia members

Lansky, Phil Kastel, and Frank Costello, he also obtained

an interest in the Beverly Club, a plush gambling casino

in Jefferson Parish. In 1947, when New Orleans Mafia

boss Sam Corollo was deported, Marcello acceded to Corollo's

throne.

FBI files indicate that Marcello's primary source

of illegal revenue was a local gambling network operated

DocId: 32267342 Page 8

## Page 9

= 3 -

by his six younger brothers - primarily Joseph and

Vincent - and lieutenants Joe Porretto and Nofio

Pecora. Surprisingly, however, the preponderance of

material in the FBI files on Marcello in the late fifties

and the sixties pertains to Marcello's ostensibly legitimate

real estate transactions. The files reflect relatively

little organized crime activity,although it is alleged

his investments in real estate are a method of "laundering"

money for other mafia families.

When Robert Kennedy became Attorney General in

1961 under his brother's administration, Marcello was

targeted as one of the organized crime figures against

which the Justice Department was to launch an unprecedented

onslaught. On April 4, 1961, Marcello was deported to

Guatemala in a manner which he allegedly described to

associates as

a "kidnapping." Approximately 2 to 3 months

later, he clandestinely re-entered the United States.

The crackdown of the Kennedy Justice Department allegedly

infuriated

Marcello.

At his retreat at Churchill Farms

in September of 1962, Marcello is alleged to have complained

to a meeting of his associates that Bobby Kennedy was a

"stone" in his shoe and to have assured the group that

both Kennedys would be killed.

OBJECTIVE I. To determine whether Carlos Marcello and

other Organized Crime Figures, because of their

business interests in Cuba prior to the rise

of Castro, were involved in killing the President

in order to reverse American policy towards

Cuba.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A.

Organized Crime Interests in Pre-Castro Cuba

Although there are numerous rumors to the contrary,

there is no firm evidence that Marcello had any sub-

stantial business interests in Cuba. If Marcello had

business interests in Cuba, they would most likely

involve gambling or narcotics. It is known that two.

of his closest associates in the Mafia, Meyer Lansky

and Santos Trafficante, had substantial Cuban business

interests. It will be necessary to probe Marcello's

relationship with them to determine both whether

Marcello had Cuban business interests or whether they

solicited Marcello's aid in an attempt to recover their

financial losses in Cuba.

B.

Marcello's Participation In or Awareness of

Assassination Plots Against Castro

The Schweiker Report emphasizes that the

Mafia-CIA plots against Castro suggest the possibilities

DocId:32267342 Page 10

---

## Page 11

-2 -

that either (1). Castro used organized crime in the

assassination of President Kennedy as a form of

retaliation or (2) that organized crime was

motivated to assassinate President Kennedy as an

alternative method to effect a change in the Cuban

government.

To probe hypothesis number 1, Marcello

will be questioned about his relationship, if any,

with Castro.

To probe hypothesis number 2, Marcello

will be questioned to determine whether he was involved

or knew of CIA-Mafia plots to assassinate Castro.

There is

no firm evidence that Marcello had a relation-

ship with Castro or participated in the Mafia-CIA

plots.

C. Marcello's Participation In or Knowledge of

Anti-Castro Groups Based in New Orleans

New Orleans was a center of anti-Castro activity.

Several groups of anti-Castro Cubans trained at Lake

Ponchartrain for raids on Cuba.. Marcello's close

friend, Nick Popich, owned land along the lake which

was used as a training camp. Furthermore, it is

alleged that organized crime supplied guns to many

of the anti-castro groups.

It is rumored that Marcello's

criminal attorney at that time, G. Wray Gill, SI. supplied

funds to some of these groups. In addition to the

DocId: 32267342

---

## Page 12

- 3-

groups actively training at Lake Ponchartrain,

Marcello appears to have associates who have ties

to New Orleans Cuban exiles.

Marcello should be

questioned about his relationship with these individuals

and organizations. :

OBJECTIVE

II. To determine whether Marcello, either alone or with

other organized crime figures, killed the President

because of a crackdown against Organized Crime

initiated by the Kennedy Administration?

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. Organized Criminal Activity

The Kennedy Administration crackdown on organized

crime was focused on targeting particular individuals

for investigation and prosecution. To evaluate Marcello's

reaction to being made a "target" of the Kennedy Adminis-

tration, it is necessary to determine what the loss to

Marcello and other organized crime leaders would have

been had Kennedy succeeded..'

Marcello's illegal activities

were allegedly centered around gambling and possibly

narcotics.

He is alleged to have said he could close

down

"50 - 75%" of the handbooks in Jefferson Parrish

if he so desired.. FBI informants indicate he may have

extensive dealings in narcotics, particularly from

Guatemala and Honduras.

B. Marcello Deportation Case and David Ferrie

The aspect of the Justice Department's crackdown

on organized crime which would have most obviously

raised the ire of Marcello towards the Kennedys was

DocId: 32267342 Page 16

---

## Page 17

- 2-

Marcello's deportation to Guatemala. The Immigration

and Naturalization Service in 1952 first began its

efforts to deport Marcello as an undesirable on the basis

of his 1938 marijuana conviction. The dilatory legal

tactics of Marcello's attorney, Jack Wasserman, enabled

Marcello to remain in the United States until 1961.

Since the status of "deportability" requires that a

country be willing to accept a deportee, Marcello

directed much of his delaying tactics to assuring

that no country would accept him. He initiated legal

proceedings in Italy, bribed Italian attorneys and

officials, and

allegedly submitted a forged Guatemalan

birth certificate to the Italian Counsul in New Orleans

as a last-ditch

effort to forestall deportation to

Italy.

When Robert Kennedy became Attorney General at

the outset of 1961, stories appeared in the New Orleans

press that Kennedy would act to expedite Marcello's

deportation. INS finally seized on the forged

Guatemalan birth certificate to effect his deportation

to Guatemala.. On April 4, 1961, Marcello was driven

by his attorney, Phil Smith, to the New Orleans INS

office to make his required quarterly report on his

whereabouts.

When Marcello entered the office, he

was handcuffed by two agents, driven to the airport,

DocId: 32267342 PagÃ© 17

---

## Page 18

- 3 -

placed alone on an INS plane, and flown to Guatemala.

Although his attorney was permitted to accompany

Marcello to the airport, Marcello's plane took off

while the attorney was running across the runway

in an effort to make a phone call to set in motion

legal proceedings.

Marcello re-entered the United States approximately

two

months after his deportation; his method of

re-entry remains a mystery. Marcello alleges he took

a commercial flight through Miami, but INS officials

doubt this. It is alleged he may have been flown in

from Guatemala by David Ferrie in a private plane.

Ferrie did work as an investigator for Marcello's

attorney on Marcello's case after he re-entered the

country.

David Ferrie has been a central figure in the

assassination case. Two days after the assassination,

he was arrested in New Orleans based upon allegations

that he knew Oswald, trained him for the assassination,

and was to fly Oswald out of the country after the

assassination. Oswald had David Ferrie's library card

in his possession when he was arrested.

Ferrie also has been linked to Jack Ruby. On

DocId: 32267342 Page

18

---

## Page 19

- 4 -

September 24, 1963, Ferrie called Jean West in Chicago.

On November 21, 1963, Ruby met Jean West and Lawrence

Mayers in Dallas.

Ferrie also has significant ties to the Cuban

groups in New Orleans.

He worked as an investigator

for Guy Bannister at 544 Camp Street.. Bannister had

substantial involvement with Cuban groups.

544 Camp

Street was the headquarters for several Cuban groups,

including FRD, CRC and others. It also was the address

listed on the Cuban literature Oswald distributed in

New Orleans.

C. Financing of Marcello's Real Estate Transactions

Through Teamster Pension Funds

A major aspect of the Kennedy Justice Department's

offensive against organized crime was Robert Kennedy's

indefatigable effort to prosecute Jimmy Hoffa.. The

Teamster Pension Fund was a primary source of capital

for projects constructed by organized crime,

and it was

Hoffa who controlled the diversion of those funds.

If organized crime was motivated to order the assassina-

tion as a response to the Justice Department crackdown,

Bobby Kennedy's drive against Hoffa to deprive the

Mafia of its source of funds would have been a component

element of that motive.

DocId:32267342 Page 19

---

## Page 20

-5 =

There is some reason to suspect that Marcello

participated in an organized crime effort to save

Hoffa.

First, there are allegations that Marcello

spearheaded a massive effort in the mid-to-late

sixties to free Hoffa, including offering a million

dollar bribe to Edward Grady Partin, the main witness

against Hoffa, to change Partin's testimony.

second,

Marcello, with his many investments in motels, clubs

and restaurants, is alleged to be organized crime's

"real estate man." It is likely that when Teamster

Funds were channeled to organized crime, Marcello

would have received a piece of the action, especially

in New Orleans projects. While the FBI files do not

reflect an influx of Teamster money behind Marcello

acquisitions prior to the assassination, there are

isolated reports that Marcello obtained a piece of

the

Fontainebleu Hotel in New Orleans with a $2,000,000

Pension Fund loan.

To evaluate this hypothesis, it is necessary to

ascertain Marcello's relationship with Hoffa and his

lieutenants, examine a sample of his real estate holdings

prior to the assassination, determine whether he received

Teamster funds to obtain those holdings and probe

Marcello's machinations to save Hoffa subsequent

DocId: 32267342 Page

## Page 21

to the assassination. It may also be fruitful to

determine whether Marcello knew the myriad of

Teamster lieutenants who were associated with Jack

Ruby, particularly those with whom Ruby was in

telephonic communication a month before the assassination.
