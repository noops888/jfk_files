Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

Re:

Activities of Top Hoodlums

Chicago Area

Foreman telephonically contacted a Chicago Agent November 13, 1963,

stating he had heard of an FBI inquiry as to whether Smith was

involved with counterfeit checks and that he desired that he be

contacted if any further information was desired. No arrangements

were made to interview Foreman as a result of this call.

Chicago advised that Municipal Judge Cecil Corbett Smith

was removed from his bench November 21, 1963, by Chief Jutice Bowe.

Bove took this action following a telephone call from Destefan about

who, according to Judge Bowe, furnished derogatory information

Judge Smith.

Donald Sullivan, a representative of "The Chicago American"

newspaper, telephonically contacted the Special Agent in Charge (SAC)

at Memphis late in the evening of November 20, 1963, and requested

the identify of a polygraph operator in the Memphis area, indicating

that he was in the company of a judge in Chicago who was not identified.

The SAC advised sullivan that he could make no recommendation and

knew of no polygraph operator in Memphis.

Reporter Sullivan also

inquired about a detective agency in Memphis and was advised that

the FBI was not familiar with any such agencies and could make no

comment.

Memphis advises that Chief of Police J. C. MacDonald received

similar requests from Sullivan and had refused to make a recommendation.

Memphis received information subsequently that the judge involved

was named Smith and that he was currently mentioned in the murder

matter in Chicago.

Following the contact with our Memphis SAC, "The Chicago

American" newspaper indicated that Chief of Police MacDonald and the

SAC recommended a polygraph operator.

As a result of this, Chief

MacDonald said he was conferring with the City Attorney, as

possible action against "The Chicago American" for false reporting.

On November 22, 1963, reporter Sullivan telephonically contacted

the Memphis Office and denied having indicated that the SAC or the

Chief of Police had recommended

a polygraph operator or a detective

Chicago received information November 21, 1963, from JOe

Waz, who has

furnished reliable information in the

past, to the effect

that Waz had been talking to an

individual known as "pix," an associate

of DeStefano and Foreman.

"Pix" reportedly indicated he was aware

prior to Foreman's death

that he was to be killed and heard about

his death about two hours after the killing and before the body was

found.

"Pix" allegedly said that DeStefano had asked him for Carol
