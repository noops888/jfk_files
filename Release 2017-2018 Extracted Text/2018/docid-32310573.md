ascertained from a source, which he refused to disclose,

information concerning an individual who acted as a 'front

man" for the subject and GEORGE LEVINE, close associate of

, the subject.

The Informant

related that his source refused

to divulge the name of the "front man", but elected to

call him "TONY"

• The following information was supplied

by the informant concerning TONY's assoclation with the subject:

In approximately July, 1957, TONY was introduced

to the subjects who used the name SALLY. BURNS, and GEORGE

LEVINE, his partner, by one JOE GENNA.

The subject and LEVINE

requested TONY to cooperate with them in setting up a ready-

mix cement business in Havana, Cuba.

Their suggestion was

that TONY "front" the enterprise, which they indicated would

necessarily be successful due to political connectiong

which these individuals had in Havana.

This venture did

not ultimately materialize due to difficulties which arose

In obtaining & second-hand ready-mix plant from the United

States.

However, during the time plans were being made for

setting up this buginess, TONY made three trips to cuba,

between July, 1957 and November 1, 1957.

TONY made each trip with TENNA, and on one

occasion they conferred with GEORGE LEVINE, who at that time

resided at the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo in Havana.. On

the first trip LEVINE took them to a proposed plant site

and assured them that they would have no difficulty obtaining

an option on this land or any problems during the setting-up

stages of the plant due to his excellent connections In

the Cuban Government.

on the second trip LEVINE, GENNA,

and TONY arranged for corporation papers to be drawn up

In order that the business could be instituted when they

appeared to own or manage Tony Pastor's Night Club in the

A short time after TONY had completed his

payments to SALLY BURNS, aggregating $10,000.00, he was

apartment BURNS explained to him that he was taking over an

interest in a New York night club, the Cafe de Paris at

53rd Street and Broadway, New York City, a club featuring

a big name entertainment policy. It was explained that

LOU WALTERS, well known New York City night club impresario,

was in a financial jam in this club which he had opened,

and

weeks until the club folded and went into bankruptcy.

During this period, SALLY BURNS contributed a total of

about $13,000.00 to the operation of the club and he,

TONY, personally contributed close to $30,000.00 which he

had been able to borrow from close friends.

While the club was in operation BURNS gave the

an investment in this venture. However, when the club went

into bankruptcy, BURNS Informed TONY that he was responsible

for the $13,000.00 as a personal loan from BURNS.

principal

$13,000.00, but for exhorbitant interest on

this"loan" which, to date, amounts to a total of

approximately $16,000.00.

this club he was often there during the evening hours, as

were some of his underlings, specifically the individual

referred to previously as BABE, CHICK, and BUDDY.

Part of the $13,000.00 contributed by BURNS was,

according to TONY, raised in the following manner:

At a particular time when TONY was having

difficulty making the payroll, BURNS instructed him to

accompany JOE QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey, where they were

to pick up $2500.00 from RAY (previously mentioned as
