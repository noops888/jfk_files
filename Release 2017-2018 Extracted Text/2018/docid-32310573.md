IV. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

NY T-2 advised on September 10, 1958, that he had
ascertained from a source, whichhe refused to disclose,
information concerning an individual who acted as a "front
man" for the subject and GEORGE LEVINE, close associate of
.the subject. The informant related that his source refused
to divulge the name of the "front man", but elected to
eall him "TONY", The foliowing information was supplied
by the informant concerning TONY's association with the subject:

In approximately July, 1957, TONY was introduced
to the subjects who used the name SALLY. BURNS, and GEORGE
LEVINE, his partner, by one JOE GENNA, The subject and LEVINE
requested TONY to cooperate with them in setting up a Fready-
mix cement business in Havana, Cuba. Their suggestion was
that TONY "front" the enterprise, which they indicated would
necessarily be successful due to political connections
which these individuals had in Havana, This venture did

oe not ultimately materialize due to difficulties which arose
in obtaining a second-hand ready-mix plant from the United
States. However, during the time plans were being made for
setting up this business, TONY made three trips to Cuba,
between July, 1957 and November 1, 1957.

TONY made each trip with GENNA, and on one
occasion they conferred with GEORGE LEVINE, who at that time
resided at the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo in Havana, On
the first trip LEVINE took them to a proposed plant site
and assured them that they would have.no difficulty obtaining
an option on this land or any problems during the setting-up
stages of the plant due to his excellent connections in
the Cuban Government. On the second trip LEVINE, GENNA,
and TONY arranged for corporation papers to be drawn up
in order that the business could be instituted when they

Informant stated he later learned that "JOHNNY
THE BUG" ,referred to above, 1s JOHN STOPPELLI,known as
@ close associate of ANTHONY STROLLO and VITO GENOVESE.

On one occasion,when TONY was told to proceed
to the above-mentioned. unmarked office at 40 Exchange
Place, New York City, he observed VITO GENOVESE leaving
the office as he entered, He had no conversation with
GENOVESE and GENOVESE did not acknowledge his presence at
the time.

Another individual TONY met through contact with
SALLY BURNS was a hoodlum from Greenwich Village referred
to only as "JOZ THE wop" or JOE C, This individual
appeared to own or manage Tony Pastor's Night Club in the
Greenwich Village section of New York City. Informant
stated he later learned that "JOE THE WOP” 1s JOSEPH
CATALDO.

A short time after TONY had completed his
payments to SALLY BURNS, aggregating $10,000.00, he was
contacted by BURNS and instructed to come to BURNS!
apartment on @ business matter. Upon arrival at his
apartment BURNS explained to him that he was taking over an
interest in a New York night club, the Cafe de Paris at
53rd Street and Broadway, New York City, a club featuring
a big name entertainment policy. It was explained that
LOU WALTERS, well known New York City night club impresario,
was in a financial jam in this club which he had opened,
and BURNS told TONY that he, TONY, was to assume the duties
as "front man" in the club. When TONY complained to BURNS
that he had no particular interest in entering such a
venture, BURNS reportedly instructed him in no uncertain
terms that he was to take the job and that he had no choice
in the matter, In view of the physical violence inflicted
on TONY during previous contacts with BURNS and his group,
TONY saw no alternative but to follow BURNS' instructions.

He served as manager at this club for about four or five
weeks until the club folded and went into bankruptcy.
During this period, SALLY BURNS contributed a total of
about $13,000.00 to the operation of the club and he,
TONY, personally contributed close to $30,000.00 which he
had been able to borrow from close friends.

While the club was in operation BURNS gave the
Andication that the $13,000.00 BURNS contributed was as
an investment in this venture. However, when the club went
into bankruptcy, BURNS informed TONY that he was responsible
for the $13,000.00 as a personal loan from BURNS. BURNS,
therefore,once again began demands on TONY not only for the
principal $13,000.00, but for exhorbitant interest on
this"loan" which, to date,amounts to a total of

‘ approximately $16,000.00,

Though BURNS took no active part in managing
this club he was often there during the evening hours, as
were some of his underlings, specifically the individuals
referred to previously as BABE, CHICK, and BUDDY.

Part of the $13,000.00 contributed by BURNS was,
according to TONY, raised in the following manner:

At a particular time when TONY was having
difficulty making the payroll, BURNS instructed him to
accompany JOE QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey, where they were
to pick up $2500.00 from RAY (previously mentioned as
having been in the office of VITO GENOVESE on Thompson
Street). TONY accompanied QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey to
a roadsideclub where they met RAY, who turned over the
$2500.00 to QUAGLIARELLO, The RAY referred to above,
according to NY T-2, is ANGELO DE CARLO. NY T-2 further
advised that the roadside club where the meeting was held
was the Martinique Restaurant, operated by DE CARLO in
Mountainside, New Jersey. :

Following the closing of the Cafe de Paris, TONY's
only contacts with BURNS and his element have been at
. times when BURNS has demanded payment, plus interest,on the
$13,000.00 he put into this club.

At one time during early 1958, while TONY was
with BURNS at a tavern in Atlantic Beach, Long Island,
New York, an individual identified by BURNS as Mr. JOHN
ORMENTO came over to their table and said“hello'to BURNS
on his way out of the tavern, This appeared to be a
chance meeting and there was no discussion between BURNS
and this individual.

While in Havana, Cuba, on one of his visits to GEORGE
LEVINE, LEVINE introduced TONY to a casino manager identified
@s JOE RIVERS,with whom LEVINE seemed to be very friendly.

7 NY T-2 was recontacted on October 15, 1958, and
advised that during one of TONY's visits to Havana, Cuba,
during 1957, previously discussed, TONY met an American
named LOWELL BIRRELL, who frequented tne Oriente Park
"ace Track near Havana, operated by GRANELLO and GEORGE
LEVINE, The informant related that BIRRELL was a New York
City lawyer who was in trouble with the United States
Government in connection with large scale stock manipulations
and BIRRELL was reportedly in Havana at that time to

avoid investigation or prosecution in connection with the
stock manipulations.

The informant related that it was his impression
that BIRRELL seemed to be in close contact with the
interests of LEVINE and GRANELLO in Cuba. He stated that,
in relation to stock issued in the Oriente Park Race Track
in Havana, originally this stock had been placed on the
market at around 20 cents per share and that during a

TRIAY y ESCOBAR,better known as "MIKE" TRIAY,operated the
Sans Souci Night Club in Havana for a number of years.

stated that a deal had been closed whereby a group headed by
LOWELL M, BIRRELL, described as an insurance executive of
New York and Pennsylvania, purchased the Oriente Park Race
Track in Havana. GEORGE LEVINE and SALVATORE GRANELLO were
said to be involved in the deal. At that time also LEVINE
and GRANELLO operated the bar and restaurant in the Hotel
Sevilla Biltmore in Havana, and also leased the rather smail
Hotel Victoria in Havana, They also held the gambling
concession in the casino located in the Jockey Club of

and a close associate of the owner of this club, one SALVATORE

of hijacked whiskey at that time and that this whiskey was
supposed to be shipped to Miami Beach, Florida.

through December 28, 1956, that at various meetings held in
the home of SALVATORE GRANELLQ some of the persons
