MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM - : John H. Waller
Inspector General

Jack Anderson Reference to 28 November
1963 CIA Cable

SUBJECT

1. The Operations Group of CI Staff has provided a copy
of the cable about which you inquired. A copy is attached at
Tab A. It is a dissemination of a report by a British journalist
stating that a man named Ruby was in Cuba in 1959, where he
visited an American gangster-gambler named "Santos, '' who
was living luxuriously in jail, This dissemination was based
on a 27 November 1963 cable from London, a copy of which is
attached at Tab B. A follow-up cable from London on
29 November commented. on the source of the storv, raising
a question as to his reliability. A copy is at Tab C. A more
detailed statement about the man is contained in a report
passed to the FBI on 12 December 1963, a copy of which is
at Tab D.

2. On 7 January 1964 the FBI provided CIA with a report
that Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in 1959; a copy is af Tab E.
On 30 January CIA provided additional information to the
Bureau on this subject; a copy is at Tab F.

3. The following points of coincidence are probably of
interest to Senator Baker: Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in
1959, as stated in the report that gave rise to the present
query; the name "Santos" is also the given name of Trafficante,
although it is not clear that these are the same persons, While
there are reservations about the reliability of the source of
the report which gave rise to the present question, we are not
in a position at this time to evaluate it definitively. It is noted
that the description of ''Santos'' as living in luxury in a Cuban
prison is similar to a version also reported in a 16 May 1974
story in the Outlook Section of the Washington Post,

4, As you may know, an Agency task force has been
conducting an in-depth study of all information relating to
issues surrounding the Agency's support for the Warren
Commission investigation. This study has been underway
since early July and, because of the detailed nature of the
review, may require as much as another two months if it
is to be completed with the thoroughness that we believe
necessary.

5. OLC on 2 August called Liebengood of Senator Baker's
staff in response to a query concerning Jack Ruby's alleged
trip to Cuba. Unfortunately, on the basis of inadequately
researched information given OLC, that staff admitted to
kmowing only about an allegation of a 1963 trip to Cuba by
Ruby put out as propaganda by an anti-Castro Cuban group.
The information did not include information in CIA's possession
on the 1959 trip by Ruby contained in the 1963 (Tab A) cable,
Madigan finally received from OLC a copy of the 1963 cable
on September 15, when the matter was straightened out and
the files properly researched.

6, As a relevant note on the question on whether or not
the Agency was purposely withholding the 1963 cable on Ruby's
1959 visit, we have been informed by the FOIA staff that at
least the following persons have been provided copies of the
cable:

Mark Lane

Paul Hoch

Bernard Fensterwald
David Belin

Walker & Buchanan Carrollton Press
Harold Weisberg :
George Lardner | Washington Post
David Martin Associated Press
Norman Kempster L.A. Times
Christie Basham NBC
Pamela Butler Readers Digest
Mel Elfin - Newsweek
Dan Schwartz National Inquirer
Robert L. Terpstra National Inquirer
Robert Anson New Times Magazine
ae


7. As discussed with you, I think it would be useful for
my staff, specifically Breckinridge, to get Madigan out here,
describe to him our task force approach to the problem and
otherwise convince him that we are cooperating to the fullest
on this problem, We will coordinate this with OLC,

Lelie

following information concerning one Carl John WILSON Budson,

_ Be “WILSON, a Spanish citizen of British descent
residing in Chile, was 2 contact of one Bert SUCHAROY, ~
a suspected Soviet agent, in Santiago, Chile.

de It had been ascertained that WILSON had
exrrvived in Chile on 28 January 1939 from EPuenos Aires,
bearing Spanish passport No. 7, issued in Buenos Aires
on 4 January 1939 and visaed (tourist) by the Chilean
Consul in that city on 25 January 1939. He held

In July 1936 he had left his studies at Ozford Univer~

Eubassy, issued 2 decree (No. 2344) ordering his
expuision from Chile. Later, however, the decree was
rescinded as 2 result of WILSON's pleas, his state of
health and his promise to discontinue hig misrepresenta~_
tion and other illegal activities.

-  @e In spite of his promises, WILSON had continued
these activities, numbering among others an anti~
Fascist campaign which he had associated with o "Uni-,
versal Peace Movement" to be brought about by the
elimination of all leading world powers. WILSON also
had frequently posed as a British RAY captain and had
worn the corresponding uniform.

: R. The strange mannerisms exhibited by WILSON
wére attributed to a mental iliness, and golloving
WELSON'’s second outburst, the British Ambassador pre-
sented another request for his expulsion. Again,
However, following various explanstinns by WILSON to
the British Embassy and on the renewal of his promise
to refrain from further activities of a si: imilar nature,
tae case was dropped.

2. On 7 Cctober 1952, a usually reliable source,. whose
information was evaluated 2s "possibly true," submitted the
following report eoncerning one Carlos John WILSON, who is

in 1547 and had worked on a special mission for ths
British Government in Germany, Egypt, and Turkey at
the close or World War II. Ee stated that he hed
fought with the Spanish Republican forces against Franco.
He was violently anti-United States and constantly :
condemned United States policy. WILSON was of the

‘ opinion that England and France would eventually join.
with the USSR te form a pact aimed at the complete
destruction of the United States. He claimed to be an
huthority on the Balkans, and was a strong supporter :
of Tito. Tito, WILSON stated, wovld eventually Line up
the entire Balkan area with England and Erance to assist
Russia in crushing the United States.

CiVIG RIGHTS

Mey. Carlos Villa, 1450 Coral Way, Miami, Florida,
furnished to the FBI on December 21, 1963, a letter which
had been forwarded to a friend of his named Jose Antonio
Juan, lir., Juan had received the letter from his son living ©
in Cuba.

In the letter received by Mr. Juan from his son
the statement was made, "it is known here that Rubinstein
was here a little less than a year ago visiting a Mr. Pranski,
owner of a shop dealing in tourist articles, located on
Prado Street between Animas and Trocadero, opposite the
Sevilla Biltmore.” The reference to Rubinstein appears to
refer to Jack L. Ruby who is presently in custody, Dallas,
Texas, on charges of shooting Lee Harvey Oswald.

¥or your information this Bureau's investigation
’ concerning Jack L. Ruby has developed no information that
“ Ruby has ever been in Cuba except on one occasion in 1959
when he visited there briefly on a vacation trip. Ruby
himself readily admits to this trip but has denied any other
trips to Cuba or contacts with persons there. 7

It is xequested that, through available sources of
your Agency, you develop any information possible relating
to. the above-quoted statement in an effort to resolve the
allegation that Jack L. Ruby has possibly visited Cuba since
1959 and has connections there.

buildings in the Metropolitan Washington area so that he would have’a better
understanding of the Agency's size, ‘deployment, and activities. I told Epstein

SUBJECT : SSCI Requests

Attached in order to ensure a bright holiday for you, are
some new SSCI requests.

1. Rick Inderfurth asked for an Agency report on
the 20 December 1976 Jack Anderson column and the
article entitled, "Mr. Death" in the January 1977 Playboy
magazine. Regarding the Anderson article, ] think we
should particularly comment on the statement in the first
column that Letelier carried the sensitive papers in his
briefcase in order to prevent their theft by CIA.

‘2. Mike Madigan called to inquire about the status
of the 13 December 1976 request to see files on six Cubans, ~
I said we were in the process of gathering materials. He
added that the Committee would also like access to Agency
materials on two Cuban exile organizations: Alpha 66, and
SFNE (Second Front National Escamrey).

SUBJECT: Fact Sheet re Fidel Castro's Allegation that
CIA is Responsible for the 6 October Crash
of a Cuban Airplane near Barbados and Other
Terrorist Acts

1. In his speech of 15 October 1976 in honor of the
Cubans killed in the 6 October crash of the Cuban airplane
near Barbados, Fidel Castro said that he intended to abrogate
the anti-hijacking agreement between Cuba and the United
States because, he said, the CIA was responsible for the
destruction of the aircraft and that CIA is backing a
terrorist campaign against Cuba. Castro also charged that
CIA is planning to assassinate him. In the speech Castro
said that Cuba has controlled a CIA agent over the past ten
years who had been asked by CIA to install an audio device
in the office of Osmani Cienfuegos, Cienfuegos is Secretary
of the Executive Committee of the Cuban Council of Ministers,
is the member of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist
Party responsible for Africa and the Middle East, and is Fidel
Castro's principal advisor on African affairs.

2. Three people have been accused of responsibility for
the crash of the Cuban airplane. They are Hernan Ricardo
LOZANO, Freddy LUGO, and Luis POSADA Carriles. CIA has no
information on LOZANO or LUGO, At one time we had a relation-

ship with POSADA, but it was terminated in early 1974. Our
/6 “(7 had occasional contact with him after that, ~~
Tr e Las me he was. met by an Agency officer was in June

1976, at which time he asked us for help regarding a visa
matter. His request for help was turned down. The FBI and

the Department of State have been informed of the above
regarding LOZANO, LUGO, and POSADA. There is no CIA connection
with any of the other terrorist incidents cited by Castro in
his 15 October speech.

3. In regard to Castro's announcement that the Cuban
government has had control over a CIA agent for ten years and
that this agent had been ordered to install an audio device
in the office of Osmani Cienfuegos, Castro was evidently

referring to an intelligence collection operation begun by

this Agency in 1967 when we asked the agent to report on
Cuban military, economic, and political. matters. From 1967
until the present, we have met him a number of times when

he traveled out of Cuba and have communicated with him via
coded radio message and secret writing while he was in Cuba.
We gave him an audio device in January 1975 which he told us
he installed in Cienfuegos' office in March 1976. Obviously
he did not do so. We have attempted on two or three occasions
to actuate the device and being unable to do so we concluded
that, either the device had never been installed or that it
had malfunctioned.

4. We asked the agent in early October to inform us
regarding the possibility that Castro might travel to Angola
to participate in that country's independence celebration.
Castro insinuated-in his 15 October speech that we had asked
about his travel plans in an attempt to assassinate him. This,
of course, is absolutely untrue. We continually follow the
travels of Fidel Castro and other high-level Cuban officials
as part of our standing objective to cover the Cuban leadership.
On this specific occasion we were particularly interested in
whether Castro would visit Algeria, Somalia, Mozambique or
other African countries if he traveled to Angola.

5. Castro also quoted an earlier, undated message
attributed to CIA which asked the agent a series of questions
about Cuban government reaction to terrorist acts against
Cuba. Such a mesSage was actually sent to the agent in May ~~”
1974, The purpose of this message was to develop intelligence
on how terrorist attacks against Cuba by anti-Castro exiles a
affect relations between the United States and Cuba. CIA is
not repeat not engaged in Cuban exile terrorism against Castro's
Cuba.
