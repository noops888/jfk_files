MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM

SUBJECT

: John H. Waller

Inspector General

: Jack Anderson Reference to 28 November

1963 CIA Cable

The Operations Group of CI Staff has provided a copy

of the cable about which you inquired. A copy is attached at

Tab A. It is a dissemination of a report by a British journalist

stating that a man named Ruby was in Cuba in 1959, where he

visited an American gangster-gambler named "Santos, " who

was living luxuriously in jail. This dissemination was based

on a 27 November 1963 cable from London, a copy of which is

attached at Tab B. A follow-up cable from London on

29 November commented on the source of the storv, raising

a question as to his reliability • A copy is at Tab C. A more

detailed statement about the man is contained in a report

passed to the FBI on 12 December 1963, a copy of which is

at Tab D.

2. On 7 January 1964 the FBI provided CIA with a report

that Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in 1959; a copy is at Tab E.

On 30 January CIA provided additional information to the

Bureau on this subject; a copy is at Tab F.

3. The following points of coincidence are probably of

interest to Senator Baker: Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in

1959, as stated in the report that gave rise to the present

query; the name "Santos" is also the given name of Trafficante,

although it is not clear that these are the same persons. While

there are reservations about the reliability of the source of

the report which gave rise to the present question, we are not

in a position at this time to evaluate it definitively. It is noted

that the description of "Santos" as living in luxury in a Cuban

prison is similar to a version also reported in a 16 May 1974

story in the Outlook Section of the Washington Post.

4. As you may know, an Agency task force has been

conducting an in-depth study of all information relating to

issues surrounding the Agency's support for the Warren

Commission investigation. This study has been underway

since early July and, because of the detailed nature of the

review, may require as much as another two months if it

is to be completed with the thoroughness that we believe

necessary.

5. OLC on 2 August called Liebengood of Senator Baker's

staff in response to a query concerning Jack Ruby's alleged

trip to Cuba. Unfortunately, on the basis of inadequately

researched information given OLC, that staff admitted to

knowing only about an allegation of a 1963 trip to Cuba by

Ruby put out as propaganda by an anti-Castro Cuban group.

The information did not include information in CIA's possession

on the 1959 trip by Ruby contained in the 1963 (Tab A) cable.

Madigan finally received from OLC a copy of the 1963 cable

on September 15, when the matter was straightened out and

the files properly researched.

6. As a relevant note on the question on whether or not

the Agency was purposely withholding the 1963 cable on Ruby's

1959 visit, we have been informed by the FOIA staff that at

least the following persons have been provided copies of the

cable:

Mark Lane

7. As discussed with you, I think it would be useful for

my staff, specifically Breckinridge, to get Madigan out here,

describe to him our task force approach to the problem and

otherwise convince him that we are cooperating to the fullest

on this problem. We will coordinate this with OLC.

TILSON alSO

had freguently posed as a British RAP captain and had

the Bitish Inbassy and on the reneral of his promise

In the letter received by Mr. Juan from his son

the statement was made,:

"It is known here that Hubinstein

The reference to Rubinstein appears to

For your information this Bureau's investigation

concerning Jack I. Ruby has developed no information

that

Ruby has ever been in Cuba except on one occasion in 1959

when he visited there briefly on a vacation trip.

Ruby

himself readily admits to this trip but has denied any other

trips to Cuba or contacts with persons there.

It is requested that, through avallable sources of

your Agency, you develop any information possible relating

to the above quoted statement in an effort to resolve the

allegation that Jack I. Ruby has possibly visited Cuba since

McWillie corroborated this story except that he stated only that Ruby

visited Tarana "sometime in 19a9."4r Three Chicagoans reported

VI. There is no reliable eridence that Ruby went to Tarana subse-

quent to September 10.50,12n

Although Ruby denied ever being in Irari, E there is some evi-

dence that during the summer of 1961 he was in Ilonolula sooking

While it is unlikely thar Ruby would forget a trip

to Honolulu in 1961, there is no other indication that such a trip, if

it occurred, had any sinister motires.

this would be quite an extensive plan and I would bring him a list of all

77-0072/2

Attached in order to ensure a bright holiday for you, are

some new SSCI requests.

1. Rick Inderfurth asked for an Agency report on

the 20 December 1976 Jack Anderson column and the

article entitled, "Mr. Death" in the January 1977 Playboy

magazine.

Regarding the Anderson article, I think we

should particularly comment on the statement in the first

column that Letelier carried the sensitive papers in his

bricfcase in order to prevent their theft by CIA.

2. Mike Madigan called to inquire about the status

of the 13 December 1976 request to see files on six Cubans.

I said we were in the process of gathering materials. He

added that the Committee would also like access to Agency

materials on two Cuban exile organizations: Alpha 66, and

SENE (Second Front National Escamrey).

SUBJECT: Fact Sheet re Fidel Castro's Allegation that

CIA is Responsible for the 6 October Crash

of a Cuban Airplane near Barbados and Other

Terrorist Acts

16-17

1.

In his speech of 15 October 1976 in honor of the

Cubans killed in the 6 October crash of the Cuban airplane

near Barbados, Fidel Castro said that he intended to abrogate

the anti-hijacking agreement between Cuba and the United

States because, he said, the CIA was responsible for the

destruction of

the aircraft and that CIA is backing a

terrorist campaign against Cuba.

CIA is planning to assassinate him. In the speech Castro

said that Cuba has controlled a CIA agent over the past

years who had been asked by CIA to install an audio device

in the office of Osmani Cienfuegos.

Cienfuegos is Secretary

of the Executive Committee of the Cuban Council of Ministers,

is the member of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist

Party responsible for Africa and the Middle East, and is Fidel

Castro's principal advisor on African affairs.

2.

Three people have been accused of responsibility for

the crash of the Cuban airplane.

They are Hernan Ricardo

LOZANO, Freddy LUGO, and Luis POSADA Carriles.

CIA has no

information on LOZANO or LUGO. At one time we had a relation-

SAID WIth POSADA, but it was

terminated in early 1974. Our

nad occasional contact with him after

that,

and the last time he was met by an Agency officer was in June

1976, at which time he asked us for help regarding a visa

matter.

His request for help was turned down.

The FBI and

the Department of State have been informed of the above

regarding LOZANO, LUGO, and POSADA.

There is no CIA connection

with any of the

other terrorist incidents cited by Castro

in

his 15 October speech.

3.

In

regard to Castro's announcement that the Cuban

government has had control over a CIA agent for ten years and

that this agent had been ordered to install an audio device

in the office of Osmani Cienfuegos, Castro was evidently.

he did not do so.

We have attempted on two or three occasions

to actuate the device and being unable to do so we concluded

that either the device had never been installed or that it

had malfunctioned.

4.

We asked the agent in early October to inform us

regarding the possibility that Castro might travel to Angola

to participate in that country's independence celebration.

Castro insinuated in his 15 October speech that we had asked

about his travel plans in an attempt to assassinate him.

This,

of course, is absolutely untrue.

On this specific occasion we were particularly interested in

whether Castro would visit Algeria, Somalia, Mozambique or

other African countries if he traveled to Angola.

Castro also quoted an earlier, undated message

attributed to CIA which asked the agent a series of questions

about Cuban government reaction to terrorist acts against

Cuba.

Such a message was actually sent to the agent in May,

The purpose of this message was to develop intelligence

Response:

A search has been made for the files of the Chief, WH

at Langley where he had retained some personal files;

his files are no longer identifiable.

Other materials, reviewed by the Inspectors in 1967 were

limited in nature, some of which have been made available

to SSC Staff members in envelopes in which they have been
