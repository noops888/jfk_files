Forwarded under

Attachment A are two LIENVOY

transcripts of 12 November 1963 and two LITNVOY transcripts of 17 Movember

1963 which Headquarters may consider for transmittal to Station

Forwarded under separate cover an Ailachment B is a pilotocraph of

an unidentified male (who was accompanied by an unidentified female whose

photopraph the Station assot did not obtain) who vinited the sovict Ambassy

at 1400 hours on 12 November 1963.

The Station believes this male is iden-

tical with Subject since the male in the photocraph is the only miientifie

male who was also accompanied by a woman an, secondly, this male appears

to be a nordic type.

The Station recognizes,

that Subject may have

only claimed to be a Swede for cover purposes.

The following is the comment made ly Douglas J. FRINGLASS, the

Station's LILVOY translator, coucorning Aütachment A:

"The exact spelling of this neme could not be determined.

He

slarted by saying that it is -W-1 - Il.. and then stopped, emphasizim

the two dots above A.

It is very strange that he,

beins a Swole did to'

sock the aid of his Swedish Consulase,

but applied to the Sovict Im-

bossy and acked for a man, Mion he me: by chance (?) in ? restaurant.

Tut stranger still is the response of ne Embasay officials, who woni.

oilt of their way to find a ship for him.

Usually requents of hic

nacure nie wrushed aside and quite oflen in a very rude manner.

trom his non-British accent and almost flawless English,

he must, have

lived in ine United States or Canada for quite some time.

(The Station

REDHOUD officci agrees with FEINGIASS' connent regarding

the 1.nal re-

luctance oi Soviet Embassy officials ln Help in a maitor of this lapo.)

4. Station Mexico has no rocord of any member of the Soviet alibassy

travelling to Caxaca during this period.
