in) 1, Porwarded under separate cover as Attachment A are two LIENVOY

transcripts of 12 November 1963 and two LIFMVOY transcripts of 14
1963 which Headquarters may consider for transmittal to Staton

2, Vorwarded under separate cover an Attachment Bis a photog:caph of
en unidentified male (vho was accompanied by an unifentificd temele whose
Photoyreph the Station asset did not obtain) who visited the Goviei Tnba
at 1400 hours on 12 November 1963, The Station believes this sale is iden-
tical with Subject since the male in the photograph is the only uniJeniified
male who was also accompanied by a woman and, secondly, this male appears

to be a nordic type, The Station recognizes, however, that Subject may have
only claimed to he a Swede for cover purposes.

Station's LIEWOY translator, concerning Avtachment: A:

SLASS, tthe

“Phe exact spelling of this neme could not be determined, He
started by soying that it is - WV - A - Il,. and then stopped, cmphasizin:
the, two dots above A, It is very strange that he, being a Gweie did “o’
seck the aid of his Swedish Consulate, but applied to the Sovicl mm
hassy ond asked for a man, whom he wei by chanee (7) in > restuarant.
Tt, strenger still is the response of the Embassy offici
out of their way to find a ship for him, Usually reques!,
nature are brushed aside and quite often in a very rude manner, Jnayy
from his non-British accent and almost flawless English, he mst have
lived in \.ne United States or Caneda for quite some time,” (Tne Station
REDUOUD offLeer agrees with FEINGLASS' comment regarding ‘he wna) re-
luctance of Swiet Nmbassy officials to lelp in a maitier of this type. )
