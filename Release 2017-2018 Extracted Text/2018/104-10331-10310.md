ARRB Proposed Interpretive Regulation

joins me in sending this response to your invitation to comment on the subject document. We have focused particularly on

subsections 1400.2 (page 3) and 1400.7 (page 4).

The requirement therein for release of all materials that contain names, cryptonyms, code names, pseudonyms, and aliases needs some

qualification consistent with the DCI's responsibility to protect assets of continuing national security value, liaison equities, and privacy

of U.S. citizens.

Beyond the above statutory concerns of the DCI, there is one that seemingly should be countenanced by the ARRB as a prospective

administrative burden on the CIA. That is the likely flow of FOlA requests from full release of such identification detail.

rest instin

Why cant these considerations be recognized in the ARAB document as proper subjects of productive, responsible dialoque with the CIA?
