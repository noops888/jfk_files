ATTACKS AGAINST BUREAU (MEXICO CITY AND FRANCE - 1951)

Iicant differences with CIA which culminated in a serious

and Paris reported that CIA representatives were attacking the

Bureau, were endeavoring to place us in an unfavorable light,

were questioning our jurisdiction, and were making disparaging

remarks concerning the Bureau.

Some of this was summed up by

characterizing it as covert hostility within CIA, stemming

largely from disgruntled former employees of the FBI.

In October, 1951, General Walter Beddil Smith, then

Director of CIA, asked to meet with the Director and other

Bureau representatives for the purpose of discussing the

existing differences. General Smith denied that there was any

covort hostility ageinst the Bureau and maintained that there

He admitted that

there had been isolated instances of friction for which CIA

must accept its share of responsibility.

It is my recollection that the Director and other

Bureau officials did meet with General Smith, at which time

guidelines were set forth for maintaining future relations

between the two agencies.

I was not able to find a memorandum

of record covering

this meeting. (62-80750-1712, 1715, 1716,

1726, 1728, 1748, 1750)

2. PROSELYTING OF BUREAU PERSONNEL BY CIA

The Agent clearly recalls that early in the 1950's

we encountered difficulties with CIA because the Agency allegedly

was recruiting Bureau-employed personnel.

We vigorously pro

tested, and subsequently, the Agency advised that it would follow

& policy of not having any contact with a Bureau employee until

the Individual had been separated from the Bureau for a period

of at least thirty days.

The Agent could not locate the back

ground of this matter in the files reviewed by him.

It is pos-

sible that the pertinent information lies in the personnel file

of some former Bureau Agent.

In February, 1954, we complained to CIA because the

Agency had evaluated information coming fron the key source

in the captioned case as emanating fron a fabricator. We had

disseminated certain foreign intelligence information originat-

ALLEGED BELITTLING OF COMMUNISM BY ALLEN DULLES

In July, 1959, Allen Dulles of CIA spoke at the

• National Strategy

Seminar of the National Far College.

One

of the professors handling the Seminar was critical of Dulles.

He claimed that Dulles had belittled the importance of the

communist problem.

The above is' being cited in the event we desire to

utilize the information in justifying a position that it was

necessary to be circumspect with CIA.

On June 5, 1969, information was received indicating

that Richard Helms had sent Senator Sam Ervin three proposed

amendments to the legislation being proposed by the senator,

all dealing with the protection of the constitutional rights

of Government employees.

We had been following developments

relating to this proposed legislation because the provisions

had a very definite bearing' on Bureau operations.

The proposed

amendments made by Helms included exemptions from certain

provisions of the Bill for FBI, CIA, and the National Security

Agency.

These amendments. were

suggested by CIA without prior

consultation with the Bureau.

"This presumptuous action of

Helms' is astounding." (M. A. Jones

not thousands, leads.

To develop all

of the evidence to explain these delays would require an inspection

of CIA operations. CIA has given the following types of responses:

countries.

Although CIA has not ventured to emphasize the

point, It

is believed that in many instances it has not pro

duced

satisfactorily and efficiently because of the absence

of reliable sources.

72. LACK OF PROPER ORIENTATION OF BUREAU

RESPONSIBILITIES AND JURISDICTION.

Although there has been decided improvement in

recent years,

the Liaison Agent continues to note a definite

lack of knowledge of FBI responsibilities and jurisdiction on

the part of CIA employees.

They do receive some training in

this regard, but the impression is left that such training

could be much more extensive.

The Bureau's Liaison Agent has

lectured to hundreds of CIA employees in the last few years

and this has produced significant signs of concrete benefits.

CIA employees encountered the Liaison Agent on a very regular

basis and asked questions pertaining to our responsibilities.

Nevertheless, there is room for much improvement.

There has been a sore spot in connection with cla

policy relating to its dissemination of information at a loca

is in the immediate jurisdiction of a particular agency, it

will only disseminate at the

Seat of Government.

example,

if CIA received information concerning the existence of a U.S.

criminal fugitive in a foreign country, it would disseminate

to the Legal Attache.

However, if the

information falls within

the area of intelligence, which includes subversive activities,

the Agency has stated that under its system the information is

considered to be "raw material" and that it must be evaluated

at

headquarters and reviewed in the context of what has been

received from other countries, and then disseminated to inter-

ested customers. We have not
