SH:

We'll go back to the beginning of MONGOOSE, we're talking 1961

the last part of 1961 through ‘63 to some extent.

MONGOOSE actually finished at the end of the Missile Crisis in
1962 and lasted exactly one year. ‘From October '61:to January
‘62 I was Deputy Chief of what was then called "Branch 4" of
the Western Hemisphere Division. Branch 4 consisted of Cuba
and all. the Caribbean Islands. When we started into MONGOOSE,
by the time January came around it was quite clear that that
couldn't exist any, longer in that particular organizational

eput:
bureaucratic setup, and’Dick Helms, who was then the DDP, I

guess it was, or Chief of REERTY guess, decided to ‘take
Cuba, at least, out of WH4 and set it up whe a separate branch
within WH, still under the Division Chief, a Col. J. C.

King. In January of '62, because things were getting hot and
heavy with the Kennedys on our tail, and I kept screaming--oh,
by the way, the man who was the Branch Chief was Ghosn Zogby
(of Lebanese extraction), who was a long time Agency employee
(he's now dead, unfortunately)--he was Branch Chief, I was his
Deputy) pt so-called Branch 4, When Cuba was taken out and
made a separate branch under J. C. King, Zog (nickname)
continued aeqStanch Chief, and I continued as his Deputy until
I was screaming loud and long to Dick Helms: that this is
crazy. MONGOOSE, because it was called MONGOOSE as of

196, :
ec I'm the guy who came up with the name ,—I'11 give

SH:

—SRORET™

called MONGOOSE as of October 196l1--and I'm the guy who came
up with the namée--I'll give you that background later--which,
by the way was never used in the Agency. It was never an
Agency crypt. It was an Agency-supplied cryptonym, but we

never used it.

What did you use in the Agency? Was that where "Caribbean

Survey Group" came in?

No. That was a bunch of nonsense. The Caribbean Survey Group
was something totally different. I'11 get into that later.
Anyway, I kept screaming to Helms that the likes of a Zogby
and a Halpern are not what this operation needs, because this
was not a CIA operation, it was a political operation, in the
city of Washington, D.C. And, being a political operation,
you have to have a big name in charge, you have to have some
political power. And I started off with Helms, and he said,
"OK, who do you want, smart guy?" So I started off saying, "I
think we need Des Fitzgerald," who was then Chief of FE
Division (and I'd been his Executive Officer in FE years ago,
now called EA Division). But he said "No, he's fighting a war
in Vietnam, can't use him." I said, “OK, my second choice is
Al Ulmer," who was then Chief of Station in Paris. I had been
Al's Exec in FE Division when he was Chief of FE in '56 or
'57, '58, I guess, And he said, "No, can't spare him." My
third choice was Tom Karamessines, who was then either Chief

Ta

in Vienna or Chief in Rome, I'm not quite sure. I think Chief
in Rome. Again, Dick said, "Nope, can't spare him." I said,
“My fourth choice is Bill Harvey," who was then Chief, FI
Staff/Division D, and I thought he could be spared. Anyway,
Dick said, "I'll think about it." A few weeks later, still
January of 1962, Bill Harvey came over to a meeting we were
holding, Zog and I were holding, in terms of what do we do to
answer some of. the pressure from the White House. How do we
write papers which in effect says to the President "You're
just full of it, it isn't going to work, you've got no assets,
you wanted it all done by mirrors, and we can't do it, but
we'll try." Well, that is not a forward looking paper. And
Zog and I had to have some kind of help in terms of how do you
draft. in the English language something which says: "It isn't
going to work, boss, but we'll try." And make it sound good!
Anyway, Bill came over one day to one of these meetings, and I
thought to myself then, “Whoops, maybe we're going to get Bill
to take over." Because this is a political operation inside
the bureaucracy of Washington, DC; it's got nothing to do
with Castro. Bill came over, and shortly after that
particular meeting, which was then in the old Quarters Eye
Building, where we were still stationed in the old Bay of Pigs
offices-~shortly after that, Bill became the Chief of what
later became Task Force W. And when Bill came over and Task
Force W was created, it was quite clear that Bill could not be
subordinate to J. C. King, so Cuba was taken away from WH”

Division and made a completely separate task force all of its
own. So, from being Deputy Chief of Branch 4 in WH Division,
I became the Executive Assistant to the Chief of the Task
Force, TFW, in January '62. I presume that answers your

question.

Yes, very completely. Thank you. My next one will be a broad
sort of one. What, as an Agency historian, do you think I
should know about Operation MONGOOSE that I might not

know--that is not known or has been misrepresented?

Oh, that's easy. Let me start off--I happen to have this by
accident, sheer accident--Bill Buckley's new book, called
MONGOOSE, RIP. He says it's fiction, but he also says, on
pages 319 and 320, in something he calls "Booknotes," he says,
“This is a work of fiction. The most conspicuous historical
characters are obviously characters in history. And some of
the episodes are drawn from official and non-official, but
creditable sources." I'm still reading. I'll take this apart
bit by bit as we go and you'll understand why I'm doing it.
"Operation MONGOOSE was the name given by the CIA to the
attempt to assassinate Castro from 1961 to 1962 and to related
questions." Period. End of Quote. That is a bald-face lie
from beginning to end. The name MONGOOSE was not a name given
by CIA to any operations. Ed Lansdale, General Lansdale, as
the Chief of Operations for what became known as Operation

4
Sherr?”


13-00000

General of the United States, who we'll presume reported to
the President, his brother. Lansdale asked CIA--and I was the
officer involved--for a cryptonym he could use for this
national--I use the word, "national"--operation. All agencies
were involved. It was not a CIA operation. I went to the
cryptic reference officer--I forget her name, Mrs. Gilbert, I
think--at the time, and I said, "Give me a cryptonym with a
digraph on the other side of the world--away from WH Division
or Latin America." I said, “This is going to get all over the
building anyway, let's confuse them as much as we can for at
least five minutes. And when the cryptonym gets all over the
world, let's confuse the Russians for a while, because their

penetrations abroad will pick it up faster than we will."

But, being an old Far East hand, I said, “How about

See what they've got in the MO digraphs." She came up with a
whole list of digraphs, and I remember telling this to Fritz
Schwartz of the Church Committee Staff. He thought I..was
playing games. when I picked MONGOOSE, because of the old story
about the mongoose and the snake--an old Indian proverb or
legend. I said, “Nope, I'm not that smart. Totally

ignorant. The word MONGOOSE just sounded good." So I picked
MONGOOSE, and I gave it to Ed Lansdale. It was his cryptonym,
his operation. It was @ across-the-board Army, Navy, Air
Force, State Department, Commerce Department, Treasury
Department--every agency in ‘the government was involved in

this one. It was not just temetisery simply a CIA operation.


13-00000

And we never, never, never used MONGOOSE inside the Agency as
a cryptonym to refer to TFW. We had our own action indicator
for cables and dispatches, and we had our own info indicator,
and that's what we used. We never referred to it as
MONGOOSE. I had one rubber stamp made, just for fun and
games. tI had one rubber stamp made--MONGOOSE. It never saw
an inkpad. To this day, it's as clean as a bell. It's never
been used. The reason I can say that is because I have it.
As a souvenir. So, people talking about MONGOOSE as a CIA
operation are just talking through their hat, they're dead
wrong. And even looking at the Church Committee reports, you
will find that they don't refer to MONGOOSE as a CIA
operation. CIA was part of it, no question of that. But so
was the Army, so was the Navy, So was everybody else,
including the State'Department. And that's where you get that
reference to the Caribbean Survey Group. That's a State
Department, was a State Department-run coordination committee
of sorts. It had a fancy title, that's all. It was part of
the MONGOOSE activities, but that was State's share of the
operation. So, let me keep on going here. He [Buckley]
says: "MONGOOSE was a name given by CIA to the attempted
assassination of Castro." Not true. MONGOOSE was never an
operation designed to assassinate Castro per se. MONGOOSE was
an operation to change the government of Cuba, and there were
no holds barred, that's true. And if that meant

assassination, or if somebody felt that meant assassination,


13-00000

*

so be it. But it was not started out as an assassination
operation. It was not meant to be an assassination operation
per se. The idea was to somehow change the government of
Cuba. Even as Lansdale's stupid memorandum talking about
assassination, or Ave: e not using the word,. -
a (3 beheve dale used I gutdatien of leaders” or
_ “assassination "*--that was an afterthought. x at came much some
A Sek
later in the game. Ohrase!

MSM: “In: August of '62.

SH: Yes. And we'd been operating since October ‘61, for God's
sakes. So, for Buckley or anybody else to label MONGOOSE a)
as a CIA operation and, b) as an attempt to assassinate
Castro,.is crazy. It's. just absolutely false. Let me go on
to the next one he’s got here. All of which he's trying to
prove that everything he's got in here, while it's fiction, is
based upon fact. It's not. He says: "The attempt to
assassinate Castro via a wet suit to be given to Fidel Castro
by James Donovan without his knowledge was made." Not true.
The wet abeh ti taaN even bought. We never even had a wet

~
n suit Sinovan went ahead and did it on his own without
referring to anybody, as a gift in terms of his negotiations
about freeing the Bay of Pigs prisoners. The business of a
wet suit was somebody's brainchild. The name of the man who
thought of the idea was George McManus. I don't think George

is alive anymore, but anyway, George came up with the idea,


13-00000

“Look let's give Jim a present to give to Castro." And the
idea was not to assassinate Castro via the wet suit, anyway.
It was to disable him, make him sick. But the thing never got
LZ _dowt 4
off the grou fho-aeee even bought the wet suit. Didn't
need to, because by the time we were thinking about it and
discussing it and wondering what the devil to put into the wet
suit to make him sick, Jim had already given him the wet
suit. So we dropped it. And that brings me to another point
that's in the beginning of the book here, by the way. Very
fortuitous. Buckley starts off the book, in an unnumbered
page right in the beginning, quoting from the Church Committee
Report, which says, "We have found concrete evidence of at
least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel
Castro from 1960 to 1965." That's totally false. There were
no eight plots, because among the plots~-thes®e so-called
alleged eight plots--one is the wet suit, which never went off
the drawing board. Another one was Des FitzGerald's idea of
that exploding seashell. And that one never got off the
drawing board; it never even got on the drawing board. Des
came in one morning and said he had come up with an idea while
he was shaving. “Let's make up a fancy seashell, fill it with
explosives, put it on the ground, on the seabed, and when
Castro sees it he's bound to go for it, and it will blow up in
his face." I looked at Des and I said, “you're crazy. It'll
never work." He says, “You're always negative. Go talk to

TSD." It's now called OTS. I said, "Okay, I'll talk to them,


13-00000

but it's crazy. How the hell are you going to control that
thing? How are you going to make him go for that one shell
among a lot of others on the seabed? In the first place, how
the hell are we going to get it onto the seabed?" And he
says, “Go find out." Okay, I dutifully went and talked to the
TSD people. They looked at me and said, “Is Des kidding?" I
said, "No, he wants to know what's the chances." “tell him
it's zero.” So I went back and told Des it was zero. That, P
my opinion, is not a plot. And neither is it an attempt to do
something. It never got off the ground. And among these
eight that they've listed--and I remember making the same

notations on the report when I wrote it and made my comments

on it...
MSM: This is indeed a quote from the Church Committee?

SH: This is a quote from the Church Committee Report. Among those

eight plots are things like this which never got off the

ground.} We sat around and thought of all kinds of crazy

because those were the requirements--to think of all

things,
inds of crazy things, and we did. But they weren't plots;
hey weren't attempted. There were a few that were, and we
an get into those later. So, what is being said as fact is
not. It's just not true. And, let me go on. OK, the top of
Ypage 320: "The attempt to poison Castro by poison pills

hrough his mistress is factual (e.g., Paul Meskil, ‘CIA Sent


13-00000

Bedmate to Kill Castro,' New York Daily News, June 13,
1976)." he woman--and I remember the story though I don't
have the clipping. I remember the story. The woman may have

actually felt that she was recruited and working for cra A We

never, never, never, never sent a mistress or a bedmate or
whatever you want to call it as one of the activities to try
to undo Castro. We just didn't. Other people may have used
CIA in terms of a false flag recruitment and convinced her
they were working for CIA, and that happened many a time. We
know, for example, that the US Army, Army Intelligence, used
CIA for cover in some of its activities in support of
Operation MONGOOSE, down in Miami, but we didn't know a damn
thing about it. And they were claiming they were CIA
operators, and recruiting people. And-I think there is pretty
good circumstantial evidence, if not hard evidence, that the
carcthyebtieerteiting plan, for which they went to prison--he
and a brother, or he and a son, went to prison for
counterfeiting Cuban pesos--I think the poor people were just
taken down a garden path. They thought they were
counterfeiting for the CIA. And they weren't. We never got
into that. The Army did, I think. And the army, I think
again, used CIA as part of a false flag recruitment for a lot
of people. So, I think this poor woman, and she may very well
have gone to Cuba for all I know, but she didn't do it for

CIA.” And we've tried, but there is no way you can correct %

Gt blicces record. It's impossible. It just won't wash.

Aa

13-00000

Even if you got all the files out, nobody is going to believe
you. But that never happened. We did not use the woman to
try to get close to Castro. No way. So that's a phony one,
Let me think. No, we did try to give him a rifle.

MSM: Which ones are correct in there? In his list.

SH: Well, I'll give them to you. “The allegation to the effect
that the Soviet Union had left in hiding in Cuba one or more
nuclear missiles, were made by Cuban refugee sources and later
by Senator Keating." That's true. Allegations to that effect
were made. So that part is true. And Keating was one of the
ones making it. But he. [Buckley] goes on to say, "These
charges were denied by Robert McNamara and John McCone on
February 6, 1963." And that's also true. But there was never
any evidence that any of the missiles were ever left behind in
Cuba. And there wasn't enough geological evidence--and I use ta

nx chat “Carefully, because the idea was that these missiles were

being hidden in caves.
MSM: McCone worried about. it extensively.

SH: Oh yeah, and we had cave experts up the gazoo going into this
whole thing in terms of the size and shape and configuration
of the caves of Cuba, and there was lots of information about
it, believe me. Nonpolitical stuff. Purely measurements and

A what have you, A lot of SHC RIN a lot of work on that.

N

13-00000

He
ae

And the DDI people in those days were able to dig it all up
and prove that you couldn't put those missiles in any of the
caves in Cuba. Not unless they built special caves for them.
And there was no indication that they had ever done anything
like that. So, true; allegations were made, and, true, the
allegations were denied. He's right about that. I don't know
anything about the assassination of Bianco Rico by Rolando
Cubela, and that I presume he got from the sources he lists
here, as well as I'm sure ¥Granmag%, the Cuban newspaper, had a
lot about Cubela at the time of Cubela's trial. And so a lot
of it may have ‘come out there. That I just don't know. The
next one is true. The attempt to expedite the assassination
of Castro by providing Cubela with an appropriate sniper's
rifle is factual. That part is true.-cghe-enty trouble was;
he-rever—accepted—it., He never took the pen, the hypodermic

pen, that we prepared for him. And the rifle, I don't think ~
he ever took, either. Although we were authorized to give it
to him. Or, rather, Des had. authorized us to give it to

him. The next one is the statement by Castro threatening
retaliation against political assassination--that's factual.
Yeah, he uses an awful source for that. There's no reason to
use George Sue on that as a source, pmashingtonibost article
of May a"Bee Castro's statement was made in September of 1963,
and Tad Szulc used it quite a bit, FBIS had it, so there is no

Crile :
reason to use George Keagre as a source on this. And this one

is a queer one: “The sponsorship of Operation MONGOOSE by

12


13-00000

President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy is
asserted by Thomas Powers and John Ranelagh." Why use Powers
and Ranelagh as sources for that? The Church Committee will
tell you that right there. That's crazy. The next one is:
“Although any*direct knowledge of the plan to assassinate
Castro was denied by CIA director John McCone, (Church
Committee, Powers, Ranelagh) it is widely questioned that he
was in fact ignorant of the operation." He was ignorant of
the operation, believe me, He didn't know a bloody thing
about it. McCone was literally ignorant of the operation,
Nobody was about to go check with him on this one. And,
again, the Church Committee report is. very clear that
depending upon which activity you were talking about, McCone
never knew about the Rosselli business; without question he

knew nothing. about the the Rosselli. business. tbrbheet

far as the AM/LASH or the Cubela activity is concerned, I

doubt if even Helms knew about it at the time. Des was
keeping this close to his chest. And, as I reported to the
House Assassinations Committee under Congressman Stokes
several years later, there were four people who knew about the
attempt to assassinate Castro using Cubela, and the four

were: me, the case officer involved dealing with Cubela, Des
FitzGerald, and the doctor who provided us with the fountain
pen made into a hypodermic and told us what to use. Four

people in the Agency. Those were the days when you could

still maintain some kind of limited activity, or limited
knowledge rather than activity. As I said, I don't think Des
even told Helms about it, let alone McCone.
Why not McCone?
It's the same as you don't tell the President the details.
The job of the Agency is to carry out orders. The details are
something else.
And the orders came from...? This is the old question.
As far as I'm concerned, it came from John F. Kennedy.
Through Bobby?
Through Bobby.
Through Lansdale? Or just directed?

Directed. Des and ,Kennedys were pretty close.

Do you know that for a fact, or is that just simply the way

you assume it must have been?

I think it's the way he reacted, the way he talked, the way
Des talked. The pressures Des relayed. His attitude when the
President was killed. And the conversations he had with his
wife, Barbara, in terms of going over to the house, the
Kennedy house. Things like that. There's no question in my
mind, they were close. Now, how close, I don't know. First
name basis, sure, no problem. Whether they talked to each
other about investments or whether they went on vacations
together or not, I don't know. But as far as this particular
activity is concerned, there is no question in my mind. Des
wasn't just doing these things out of his own mind. The
pressures that he relayed practically every morning when we
got into the office were just unbelievable. I've never been
on an operation like that ‘before in my’ life, and I have been
in some fairly sensitive ones. It was just different. It was
just an attitude. We were all under the gun to do something
and do it fast. And there were no excuses accepted of any
kind.

“you," meaning you, Helms, FitzGerald, Harvey...?

Well, there are two different periods

Yes, I realize I'm mixing two periods.

And I happened to be in both periods, unfortunately.

Pre-Missile Crisis, post-Missile Crisis...
Yes.

By “under the gun," you mean the pressure that was being

exerted by Bobby?
By Bobby and by the President.
By Bobby on behalf of the President?

Oh yeah. Bobby was on the phone to case officers on the Task
Force, and later the Task Force became cebted SAS. And
Bobby's secretary--Angie, or Angela--she was on the phone
relaying orders from Bobby, as well. To case officers, right
down in the--we were in the basement, cg. whatever it was--and
I remember we had to have a case officer, for example, whose
sole job was to carry out Bobby's wishes vis-a-vis the
underworld--let me call it the gangster world. This case_
officer was given--and I'm not trying to be racial on this
thing, or ethnic--was given an Italian-sounding name. The guy
looked like he belonged on the Redskins' line. Huge, big,
hulking guy. Lovely fellow, marvelous guy. And his sole job
in life was to. go to the various people that Bobby sent him
to, all underworld types, all across the United States,

because Bobby had the idea that since the underworld had had

16


13-00000

2

lots of connections inside of pre-Castro Cuba, that they must
have left their own staybehinds behind there. And therefore
they knew the place, and had the place pretty well wired for
information. Knew how to survive. And why the hell wasn't
CIA tapping this resource, this marvelous resource? And we
had to tap it. So we assigned one guy full time, and the
telephone calls he got from Bobby, right out in the--we had a
big front area, the only way we could devise it: there was
the Chief's office, the Deputy Chief's office, my office, and
then what they called the "big arena," where we had Sigetloe
secretaries out. in a big bullpen kind of thing. We had a
couple of phones, the outside lines, out in that bullpen. And
thebatirbes=Charlie was always answering the phone or being
called to the phone,, because his boss was calling--namely,
Bobby. And, "OK," Charlie would say, "Guess I got another
trip to make." And so, the pressure was direct. It didn't go
through channels, believe me. McCone didn't even know about
all this. Helms didn't know about this, except for what Des
told him. Charlie would stick his head in to me--he wasn't
going to bother, first Bill Harvey, and then later Des--he
wasn't going to bother them with all those details. “I'm
going off on a trip." You don't bother the boss with, "I'm
going off to Denver, I'm going off to Las vegas, I'm going. off
to Miami, or whatever. He would stick his head in and say,
"I'm off again, Sam, good-bye.“ I'd say, “See you when you

get back." What else can you do? And the whole idea was to

17


13-00000

MSM:

SH:

MSM:

SH:

go out and talk to these people, whoever they were, and bring
back all these wonderful ideas on how to get rid of Castro.
And that was the phraseology--"get rid of Castro." It didn't
mean assassinate him, per se, just meant change the

government. But if it meant assassination, fine, too.

Bobby used that phrase extensively in meetings, and it can be

taken either way.

Take it exactly what the phrase is--"get rid of." He didn't
say, "get rid of, except don't have him break a leg," or “get
rid of, but don't have him catch a cold"--just "get rid of."
You can take it any way you want. There were no holds
barred.

Most of the activity, the assassination attempts, you seem to

indicate took place under Des FitzGerald rather than...

' Not true, not true. The ones I knew about. There's only one

basically, the AM/LASH operation. The only one I was directly
involved in. I say these four people were the only ones
involved in that one. Under Harvey, Harvey being a good old
bureau man, kept his own counsel, and all of his dealings with
Rosselli were unknown to me and unknown to his deputy. (Pause
for telephone call). I was commenting about the fact that

under Harvey, his dealings with Rosselli were not known to

18

anybody. They weren't known to Ted Shackley as Chief of Miami
(JMWAVE in Miami, the station). They were not known to Bruce
Cheever, who was Harvey's deputy. They were not known to me,
Harvey's Exec. Harvey kept his own counsel. And I guess
about the only one who even knew that Harvey had been in touch
with Rosselli may have been Shef Edwards, but Shef would never
know the details. Shef maybe put Rosselli and Harvey
together, or at least his Office of Security did, originally,
but Harvey wouldn't tell anybody a bloody thing, I'm sure. So

McCone wouldn't know about that, and that's what I was

referring to here. I think McCone's an honest guy, and when

he said he didn't know that there was an assassination going
?
on or : what have you, I believe him. Every

second of the way.

How come Helms didn't?

What Harvey told Helms, I have no way of knowing. On the

AM/LASH?

No, I mean Helms didn't seem to believe that McCone could not

have known.
Well, the only thing I think with McCone is the same, and he
said it in the Church Committee report, is that he couldn't

have gone along with any kind of assassination because he

19

would have been excommunicated from the Church, and he is a
very devout Catholic. and so, I take the man at his word.
Why Helms thought that McCone had to know something, I don't

know.

Because he did indicate this again and again throughout the

“hearings. It's an interesting mystery.

I don't know. He had better relationships with McCone than I
ever did, that's for sure. So I don't know. I didn't know
McCone from a Whole in a wall. First time I really got to see
McCone in action was when I was @ DDP representative to the
inter-agency committee doing the after-action report on the
Cuban missile crisis, which McCone chaired. And I saw him
first time in action, in real action, with coat off any
shirtsleeves, into the wee hours of the morning--and it was
quite a session, several sessions. And McCone was a rough
taskmaster, very rough. And at the time I thought he was an
awful DCI, but in retrospect, I think he was the best one we

ever had.

For what reasons?

fe e. sé
The guy knew how to manage. He had sheets the President,

which is the first job of any DCI--at least in our days, that

was the. first thing. We didn't have to worry about Congress

new,
so much in those days. And maybe it Moin the world now, and

you have to divide your loyalty, which I think is wrong.
Because as far as I'm concerned, CIA is a part of the
Executive Branch, and the head of the Executive Branch is the
President, and not the Congress. And I think there's a
division, of labor there which Congress steps over the line too
often on all kinds of things, not just intelligence. Anyway,
McCone had good relations with the President, both Kennedy and
then Lyndon Johnson, and when he lost that good connection
with the President, Johnson, he quit. And that was the right
thing to do. And he quit in '65. He wasn't asked to leave,
he quit. And I think McCone knew how to get things done, knew
how to manage, knew how to delegate, and did not confuse
himself with all kinds of minutiae, as~some of our Presidents

have done. Like Carter and Kennedy.
Kennedy, too?

Oh, Kennedy was awful on minutiae. As I testified to the
Church Committee--Bobby, particularly, and the Special Group
(Augmented), which was the group that oversaw or had the
oversight for the Operation MONGOOSE--when we presented plans
to them for sabotage operations into Cuba, the questions were,
“What kind of shoelaces are the men going to wear?," and
“what's the gradient of the beach?," and “what kind of sand is

there?" Now that's ridiculous for a man at that level to

21

MSM:

SH:

worry about that kind of stuff. That's the same thing that
happened during the missile crisis itself, when the White
House was trying to tell the Navy commanders at sea, the
Atlantic

Admiral of the Fleet, how to load his guns. In what order to
put the armour piercing, the tracers, what have you, bullets
in the machine guns, in the airplanes. Now that's nonsense,
And this is why, I think, George Anderson finally ended up as
Ambassador to Portugal... He got kicked out of the CNO job
because he tried to tell the White House, “Hey look, the Navy
knows how to run a ship at sea, for God sakes." And that's
why I say McCone was a good officer, a good director--I think

he's the best. So anyway, that digresses from MONGOOSE.
Can we go-back to the beginning of MONGOOSE?

We can go back. I just took this [Buckley book] as a text. I
got so mad when I.read that. Because people will believe it.

That's the trouble.

you were talking about MONGOOSE's origins in October of '61.
The first document I find in DCI papers is the first meeting
McCone attends. It appears to be an early meeting, if not the
first. As I recall, it is about November 21st in ‘61.

Richard Goodwin is there, I believe, Lansdale, Bobby, the
President and McCone. Very small group. And they are

discussing things, and it is very much at the beginning.

It's not really the beginning

It's after the beginning, okay. And McCone says, "Okay, this
is fine, but all this activity, all these operations, are
going to have to come under the oversight of the 5412
Committee. The President agrees, and Bobby agrees. Somewhere
along the line we seem to get a Special Group (Augmented). It
is never quite clear. Is Special Group (Augmented) the

Special Group 5412 plus Bobby?

Yes. And Taylor, General Taylor. That's the augmentation.

You've got it, right there.

I've read it a different way. I think Powers, Ranelagh and
those have described it as coming out of Special Group (CI),

which was a much larger...
Much larger.

And CI seemed to have nothing to do with Cuba. It was

everything but.

That's correct. I think the Church Committee history of that,
I think Karalek&s got this particular part of it right. She
got a lot of things wrong. As a matter of fact, when her
history came out, in '75 or '76, I sent her :something like

23


13-00000

twenty-odd pages of handwritten corrections of things that I
new about, so she didn't get itvright, either. But I think
in this particular aspect...[comment on. Church Committee
report]. Oh, there's tons of stuff that's wrong with that.
You should see my copy of the thing, it's all marked up. Of
things that I know about. God knows there's lots of things I
don't know about. And I know more than I need to know, I
suppose anyway. But anyway, coming back to the Special Group
(Augmented) and the origins of Operation MONGOOSE, I think
that the creation of the Augmented, I think it's fairly
accurate if my memory serves me, in the Church Committee
Report itself--and you can check that, look at it. I don't
want to take the time now; we can if you want to. But let me
give you.a little bit of background on-this. I came back from
Saigon in October '61. And after giving my report to both
Des, who was then chief of FE Division, and to Bissell, and to
(I guess) Helms, as to what I thought about the situation in
vietnam at: the time--and this was when there was a grand total
of 3,000 Americans--men, women, and children--in Saigon, if
you can’ imagine what it was like. It was beautiful. Still a
little old French city, except that the VC, the Viet Cong,
were all-over the place. After giving my report about how bad
I thought the situation was and some recommendations as to
what should be done, I was told to take a few days off, go
home and relax, forget about it. And I didn't have any

assignment at the time as to what I was going to do next. I

24


13-00000

was sitting out in the back yard here and had the radio on and
a beer in hand, and suddenly they announced that Walt Rostow

and two guys from the White House were going out a a mission
to look at the situation in Vietnam. I said, “Well, my report

had some effect, anyway. They won't believe me, but at least

_ they're going to go check me out." I went back into the

office in October '61, and I was told to go see Bissell.
Bissell, whose career had been ruined by the Bay of Pigs, and
everybody knew it, and he didn't know how long he was going to
be around anyway--he allowed as how he had a job for me. And
the job was Cuba. And I said, “Where the hell is that?" And
so, he sent me over to see Zog. And that was the first time
I'd ever met Zog. And then, that same day Bissell called for
both Zog and me to come back and talk to him. And it was at
that time, early October ‘61 (and I can look it up on my old
calendar to see just what day it was, if necessary), he
said--and this is actually quoted in the Church Committee
report, because I'm the guy who told them--Bissell said he had
been in the Cabinet Room at the White House, and he was told

by both the President and by Bobby to get off his ass and get

_xid of Castro. That's the beginning of MONGOOSE, as far as I

know it. And then he said that Ed Lansdale was probably going
to be in charge of the operation. It was going to be a
government-wide operation, under tight control, and that Ed
would probably come over to get a briefing from us. Well, Ed

came over--this was before MONGOOSE itself was actually

25

formalized, because I don't think that was formalized until
sometime in November--McCone wasn't even on the scene yet.
McCone may have been a gleam in Kennedy's eye, but he sure as
hell wasn't in charge yet. He wasn deck. I don't think
McCone came around until November, sometime, Ed came over and
sta@}ed all kinds of screwball ideas and laid out his plan for
the operation. All the agencies of the government,
particularly CIA, State Department and sg aspects of the
Defense Department were going to detail men, money and
materiel plus space, to what amounts to a new agency headed by
Lansdale. “And these people and. the money and everything else
was going to be taken away from these agencies,on detail, and
Ed was going to run a new agency against Castro. This was

Ed's idea. No other way to do it. Well, we thought it was

crazy.
McCone thought it was crazy.

You're damn right, because we sent out papers right away
saying, “Whoops, what's going on here?" McCone, Rusk and
MacNamara, not only said "No," they said "Hell, no. The money
is appropriated to the respective agencies by the Congress of
the United States; we're responsible to the Congress of the
United States for that money, etc. etc. You can't take the |
stuff away from us. We'll do all we can to help, but through

the normal chains of command." So in effect, Lansdale became

26


13-00000

Chief of Operations, technically and theoretically through the
various Secretaries--the two Secretaries and the DCI plus
whatever other agencies he needed help from. In practice, Ed
dealt directly, for example, with views Bil] Harvey after Bill
was named.in January of '62. Before then, Lansdale dealt

«tals withas a
directly with Zogby and me. And he used as his.y- i

man named Frank Hand,
re ttst at v7. and Frank was the guy
who was actually the legman between Lansdale and Zog and me,
I knew Frank from way back--he was an old Agency guy, and he
had been sent to the Pentagon on detail. As a matter of fact
on it was Frank's suggestion that got me thinking about Blew
something bigger than a Zogby and a Halpern. at this level,
you need some political weight in this town, and that's when I
went through that whole business about’ getting somebody else.
And I remember ‘Frank saying, when Bill Harvey was picked in
January, he said to me, “Now, Sam, the Agency is showing good
sense. They finally put a real top-notch operator in
charge." That was the attitude of Bill as a rough tough
s.o.b. On the outside. Inside, he was soft as melted
butter. A wonderful guy to work for. If you didn't mind
having a loaded gun pointed at you. So MONGOOSE began in
October '61, shortly after I got back from Saigon, and didn't
become formalized until I think it was, November '61, and
that's when you had your meetings that you probably have

records of.

Right. Right. There's a Presidential Directive that appears

at the end of the month.

Okay, as you well know, by the time a Presidential Directive
gets put together and signed, a hell of a lot of stuff has
happened before. And, while theoretically that's the formal
beginning of an activity, its genesis is long before that.
It's just like the Church Committee. It didn't,spring up out
of nothing in January of '75, it began months and months and
months before, by other people who were looking into
destroying CIA, and they succeeded. Anyway, that's the
beginning of MONGOOSE. And, as I say, I didn't even give that
the cryptonym until sometime in '62. So, you didn't even have
aname for it. But he was looking for it. That's the

beginning of it.

A period that I find terribly interesting in respect to
MONGOOSE is the Cuban missile crisis. During the crisis, the
Agency has been portrayed as being a rogue elephant in Cuba,

and...

And Garthoff's latest articles about the teams that Bill sent

in?

The teams that Bill sent in were not sabotage teams, contrary
to what Garthoff says. They were, in effect, pathfinder
teams. Intelligence teams, reconnaissance teams--whatever
phraseology you want to use. They were not, repeat not,
sabotage teams. And you don't have to accept my word for it:
go talk to the guys involved who were down in Miami at the
time. Talk to Ted Shackley--that's unfthe teams left from,
from Florida. And Ted is in town somewhere. But those were
pathfinder teams. Reconnaissance teams. Bill's idea was,
that if the US forces were going in--and everything looked
like they were going to go in (they sure as hell were getting
ready for an invasion, and they were making no secret of it,
they wanted the Russians to know)--they were going to need
some kind of help getting in. And it is always nice to have
somebody on the beach waving you in, telling you that's the
way to go. Rather than go stumbling across some landmines or

something.

Was this his idea alone?
Bill's? That I don't know.

This is what I need to find out.

I don't know if, you'll ever find out. Maybe you'll find out

by talking to Ted, but it's possible even Ted wouldn't know.

Bill was a man who kept his own counsel. I don't think Bruce
Cheever would know either, if you talked to Bruce-~Harvey's

My question really comes down to, when did the President call

a. halt to MONGOOSE operations?
It was long after the Missile Crisis.

Okay. Because it has been claimed that the intent of and the
direction from Bobby and the President was to call a halt to

operations. in Cuba during the Missile Crisis.

We never got any word. At least I never saw any orders to
that effect. MONGOOSE was a hell of a lot more than just an
assassination plot, as I tried to explain. All of our
activities around the world, in terms of intelligence
collection--all of our assets inside the island of Cuba, on
the island of Cuba, were still being tasked for collection of
intelligence, no matter what’ the hell was going on. And in
that regard, MONGOOSE didn't shut down. Until after the

missile crisis.

And as far as you know, no one told or gave the direction to

shut it down?

Never saw it. Never heard of it.

Was Harvey fired or removed from Task Force W during the

middle of this missile crisis? And, if so, what happened?

I think it was right after--well,. the Missile Crisis only

lasted about what--ten days?
It was over by October 28.

Yes, 14 days, two weeks. What happened, as far as I know
it--and this differs from what you're going to get from Walt
Elder, if you talk to Walt (Walt was McCone's Exec., and
sometimes I think he forgot (he) tha was an Exec. and not the
Director, but that's between Walt and me, and we've had this
over the years--we're old buddies). Harvey, at the White
House, told the President and Bobby what he thought of them in
no uncertain gutter language, in McCone's presence. He just
let himself go. The exact words I'll never know--I don't
think anybody will ever know unless McCone remembers them.
But Bill was so mad, so angry at the whole effort (I guess
maybe even starting with the Bay of Pigs, for all I know)--at
the attitude and the way the Kennedys handled themselves, in
that they were more concerned about the Kennedy escutcheon
than they were about the security and safety of the United

States. The Kennedy name meant more to them than anything

had to remove him and couldn't let him go back to the White
House again.

This was during the missile crisis?

During the Missile Crisis.

Do you know when?

I'd have to really think about that one. I just don't know.
Where did you hear this? I'm curious.

From Bill.

From Bill:

And from Bruce Cheever, who also heard it from Bill, Bill
just let himself go. He told President Kennedy what the hell
he thought of him, that's all. It's very hard to do that to
any President and survive, let alone with the Kennedys. And
McCone had no choice but to remove him. And then, when that
happened, somehow Helms got into the act (Helms was then DDP),

and Helms saved Bill's ass, and didn't fire him. ' And he kept

him out of McCone's- view. And not so many weeks or a couple

of months later, he sent Bill off be ekice of Station, Rome.
Just to get him the hell out of the way, so he wouldn't be
around the building and all that kind of stuff. And Bill went
off in early '63 to Rome. And Des came down (I say "down,"
because we were still in the basement), he came from FE
Division to head up the Task Force, because Des had already
blotted his copybook with MacNamara, anyway, about VietNam.

We had some strong characters in those days. Guys who didn't
give a good goddamn about anything except getting the job done
right. And Des came down to take over from Harvey. And
changed the name from TFW to SAS. So that's where Harvey, in

terms of his See And he was saved by Helms.

So this account, this report that at the height of the missile
crisis, the Kennedys ordered a complete halt of operations
against Cuba, but despite these instructions Harvey approved
the landings, and as a result of that, McCone so livid with
Harvey that he removed him from Task Force W--that is just not

true at all?
Not as far as I know.
Not as far as you know. Okay.

And I was there. If such an order had come through, I would

have had to have seen it. Bruce Cheever would have had to

have seen it. In order to transmit it down to the troops.
Somebody would have had to send a message to JM/WAVE. There's
no other place. M/WAVE was our station in Miami, actually
south of Miami. But anyway, you have to find such a message
in the cable files, and go through the cable registry and see
if you can find it. And you won't find it. As far as I know,
you won't find it. There was no such standdown, as far as I

know.

That's very interesting.

Not during the missile crisis. By jingo, we were looking for
information everywhere you could find it, and there was only
one way to get intelligence--that's from agents. And so we

were looking and looking and looking.

Could it possibly be the other way entirely-~that, instead,
during the missile crisis, the Kennedys were putting the
pressure on Task Force W, putting the pressure on for

operations?

The only pressure I remember is pressure for information.
Information, information, information. They wanted to know
what was going on.

How about sabotage?

No, that. had stopped anyway. Simply because we couldn't, you
couldn't put together an operational plan that was going to
satisfy the Special Group (Augmented) well enough to get it
going. Every one of our plans, every single one, had to be
presented to the Special Group (Augmented), so they could ask
about things like shoelaces. It took months, literally
months, to put that kind of stuff together. Like the
Matahambre mine, for example. And it was kind of crazy. So
when you talk about sabotage operations, they weren't going
off like clockwork every hour on the hour, every day on the
day, every week on the week. It took weeks and months of

planning to get even one going.

But the Kennedys--I've found some evidence that Bobby was
demanding an increase in sabotage operations right into the
early part of the missile crisis. That he was putting

pressure on.

You may have found, I don't remember that particular...

You don't have any...

No¥ recollection. If I saw a piece of paper, I might remember
a piece of paper I might have looked at. But there definitely
was not a standdown as far as I know--not on intelligence

collection or propaganda or anything like that. But the

35


13-00000

MSM:

sabotage operations--we didn't need to have Bobby keep on
pushing us. .By that time we had enough of the whiplash to
keep looking for new plans--"How do you blow up this or blow
up that, or cause some other problem?," and those were
intrained all the time in terms of the guys on the PM staff.
fe had our own PM section working on plans for “what do we go
for next?," “what are the targets?," and “how do you do it?"

And that never stopped. We kept. doing that all along.
What was the relationship between Lansdale and the Agency?

Let me put it in terms of a fighting relationship. How about
that? That's a fair summation. Most of us thought that Ed
was for the birds. I knew Ed from way~back in AY early
incarnation of the Philippines. When he made his name. He
fell flat on his face in Vietnam because he and Diem never hit
it off. With Diem, he pulled out, because Diem couldn't stand
him any more. It was counterproductive to keep Ed in

Vietnam. (This was in '54). He did very well with Magsaysay,
no question about that. But we always thought he was kind of
a kook. Most of the guys, in the old FE days, anyway. When
he was put in charge of the Cuban thing, we thought he was
even kookier. Even before it became MONGOOSE as MONGOOSE,
when he came over for his first briefings in the old Quarters
Eye Building (we were using the old Bay of Pigs war room, as a

matter of fact, and they had a huge map of Cuba on the wall),

36


13-00000

and he saw the Isle of Pines, and he said, “What's that?" So
we told him--what little we knew. This was the blind leading
the blind (I was just barely learning where Cuba was myself).
So we had some other guys around from the old days that were

still there from the Bay of Pigs, and he said, “what's on the
island?" So we told him, including the Modela Prison and so

on. And he said “Whoops, that's it." And I said, “Whoops,

what's what, Ed?" He said, “We'll take the island, we'll make

“that our headquarters command post, and we'll operate off the

island down to Cuba." I said, “Ed, are you serious? You've
got to have rocks in your head. You couldn't get within miles
of that place, let alone take the island." He said, “Oh,
that's no problem. We'll just take it." I said, “Ed, you've
got to get-your feet on the ground. It won't work. You can't
do it." He said, "Oh, we did worse things than that in
vietnam and the Philippines." I said, “Ed; I know about the
Philippines, I know about vietnam, I know what you did, and
this isn't going to work." But that's how flakey he was. In
addition to, I think you've seen the Church Committee
Report--this business about the Jesus Christ superstar.

That's Ed. So we had a fighting relationship, and everything
was done at arm's length, and I think that's one of the
reasons he used Frank Hand as a go-between--at least at my
level and, to some extent, Bill Harvey's level. But Harvey
wasn't going to take any crud from a guy like Ed. He'd call
it like it was, and if he didn't like it, Ed seco complain

to the Director.

Were things getting particularly bad with Lansdale, relations
with him, during the missile crisis? There appears to have
been a major organizational disruption of some sort. I can't

figure out what it was.

I don't know just what you're referring to. I don't remember
anything as such. Things were hot and heavy, and people's
tempers during the missile crisis were very short, let me tell
you that. Including mine being short with some of our own
case officers, some of our own personnel in the Agency. I
needed some money, for example--I needed cash one night at
about one in the morning. I needed all the cash the Agency
had in the building to send people out with’ neutron counters,
to find out if the nuclear warheads were coming in. And some
poor little guy, some finance officer, couldn't understand
this at all. And he wouldn't do it. I called the Director of
Finance and, with no by your leave, I said, “If you don't
believe me, that I've got the authority to do this, then you
call the Director. But I want that cash down here in jig
time, now!" So people's tempers were short, very short, and
nobody was being polite to anybody during those fourteen days,

believe me. On any subject. And it was rough.

After the missile crisis. Everything just dead in the water.
We continued to try to collect some intelligence, we weren't
planning any sabotage operations, everybody knew that Bill was
leaving, the new boss had not been appointed. You can get a
much better feel by talking to Bruce Cheever on this than you
can from me, because he was the guy who was really holding the
fort together, and I was helping him. But it was Bruce who
was in charge, technically. And things didn't start perking
up until January of '63, when Des was appointed. And Des came
down, and we went back into business. And all these stories
that have appeared over and over again by the Kennedy
clan--that CIA went off on its own after the Cuban missile
crisis, and the Kennedys wanted to be friends with Castro and
all that kind of nonsense--is nonsense. It is sheer, utter
nonsense, because we started back up again under Des
FitzGerald, because the Kennedys were saying, "What the hell,"
you know. "Castro is still there. Do something. Do

something!" So that's when we started all over again.

mistake. And then don't ever darken his eyes again. It was

rough. I remember, for example, during one session of his

41


13-00000

post-mortem on the missile crisis, poor Pat Carter, General
Carter, was cut to ribbons by McCone. Literally cut to
ribbons. You could almost feel the blood flow. The way
McCone just tonguelashed him in front of the entire USIB and

all of the hangers-on, including me.
MSM: For what?

SH: On the Cuban missile crisis, the beginnings of the Cuban
missile Crisis. On the handling of the SNIE, that famous SNIE

which said the Russians have never put missiles abroad, there fore.
nw “~
they'll never do it in Cuba. And McCone, of course, sitting

off in Nice knew goddamn right they will.
MSM: And he sent back..honeymoon cables
SH: Yes, and Carter didn't buy them at all.

MSM: And that was what McCone was cutting Carter up for? I've

never had any record of that, that's marvelous.

SH: You won't find any record. It was all oral. I don't think

they taped it.

MSM: This was after the missile crisis?

Oh yes. This was the post-mortem.

When would this have been? November, December?

Yes. Something like that. And I was the DDP rep. Bill

Harvey--let me give you a little bit on this...

Yes. I'm very interested.

Jack Earman was IG. Ken Greer was one of his officers on the
IG staff and Ken, I think, is living in Minnesota or something
like that. Oh, there was another guy, a nice young fellow. I
can't think of his name. Anyway, Jack and his staff were told
to do, in effect, a post-mortem, And they started doing it.
And Jack apparently called Bill Harvey and said (Bill was
still sitting there in charge) to assign somebody to help him

on this thing from the operator's point of view.
Harvey was still on Task Force W at this time?

Yes. This is right after the missile crisis. He kept sitting
there until he left, went off to Rome. ‘As a matter of fact,

when bes came down, he was still there in January of ‘63. He
was sitting, not in the--we called this the bullpen, which was
a big room across from the secretaries' rooms (I could sketch

it out for you if you're interested sometime). He kept sitting

43


13-00000

there anyway. As a place for quarters and rations until he
went to the Italian desk. Jack wanted somebody (and Jack's
dead also, unfortudtely) « He wanted somebody to represent
the pperator aon this thing, because everybody was there, from
the State Department, the DDI types, the Defense people from
all the various services, etc. And I was detailed, and Bill,
I remember, saying to Jack, “How long is this going to take?"
And Jack said, "Oh, about a day or so." Well, it lasted a
couple of weeks. But anyway, it was quite a session. And one
of the sessions I'll never forget was when we got into this
detail, and I was surprised at McCone doing this. It's one
thing to whiplash your deputy or a subordinate in private.
It's another thing to do it in what I call public,
particularly when there are a bunch of- junior officers

around. And, hell, I was a 15 or 16 in those days, and that
to me is a junior officer compared to the people sitting
around the table. Roger Hilsman was there, Kirk was sitting
there, and poor Pat Carter. Every time he opened his mouth he

was browbeaten by McCone. Over and over again. In not polite

44


13-00000

MSM:

SH:

language, which I was surprised at from McCone. ‘I never heard
him use--it wasn't gutter language, it wasn't barracks-room
language, but it wasn't polite, gentlemanly language. And I
don't remember the exact words, but the feeling I had was, in
effect, saying, "Well you dumb ninny, what the hell did you do
that kind of thing for?," you know, and that kind of stuff. I
cringed, literally cringed, sitting up ‘there. Poor Pat
Carter. I would have cringed for anybody being given that

kind of treatment.

Do you think that was typical of the relationship between the

two?

I don't know. I have no idea. Walt Elder would give you a
better feel for that than I can. Apparently, it wasn't good.
No matter what it was. It couldn't have been good. Not to
get that kind of a treatment. And this was only in one
session, and we had numerous sessions. First we had our
working group sessions, and those went on interminably. I
remember Bill McAfee, the State Department representative from
INR. Bill and I were old friends, and we got to be better
friends as a result of being on this committee. Bill and I
exchanged glances, I remember, at this particular session, and
we wondered what the hell was going on. It is unlike senior
officers to do that. So when you talk about relationships
during the missile crisis, and even afterwards, it was touch

and go for a lot of people.

What were the real sensitive issues you had to deal with

during this post-mortem?

In the post-mortem? The information that we collected--I mean
that we, the operators, collected. The uses made of the
information by the intelligence analysts. Not just CIA, but
all the analysts. How they downgraded all the information
that we provided. Some of it was our own fault, the
operators' fault, because--let me give you an example of what
I mean there. On some of the most significant (there were
about eight, if I remember correctly--six or eight really
significant reports) about missile sightings, which were
downgraded by the entire community (the analytical side of the
community), and on one or two of them (I'll never forget this,
because it was our fault and I had to admit it at the meeting)
the headquarters comment (we had headquarters comments in
those days, I don't know if they still do), the report itself
said that the agent reported to have seen something that was
30 meters long. Headquarters comment “S4& that the source
probably meant 30 feet long. And I hadn't seen this. Jack
King--gobn Kerry King--was the Chief of Reports for the Task
Force, and he was the guy who saw it and OK'd it and put it
out. I didn't see it until much later, That in effect cut
the feet off of the report. So it was that kind of sensitive
issue in terms of collection capability, the sourcing, the

reports writing of it, the headquarters dissemination of it,

46


13-00000.

72 7

and what was done with it by the analysts. And everybody was
fighting for turf. And everybody was sensitive as to whether
they did anything right or wrong. That was one of the
issues. Another issue was the mechanics on handling
oeverflight photos. The Navy took some pictures, for example,
of one Soviet merchant ship at sea bringing stuff in with big
nolds, big hatch covers. It took ten days for those photos,
ten days, to show up somewhere @n the analyst's desk. What
happened to the pictures for ten bloody days? And you're
sitting on the Soviet side, you see the plane overhead coming
down low in a swoop and taking a picture, Navy markings and
all (it was a Navy plane), and you report back to Moscow, you
know, "Plane overhead, I'm still heading for Havana." And
nothing. The US government doesn't do-a thing for ten whole
days. So, if you're sitting in Moscow on their version of a
National Security Council, you're thinking “Well, maybe they
don't care. So, okay, we'll keep on going." That was a
sensitive issue. What happened in those ten days. The Navy
couldn't figure--I don't know to this day that they ever
figured out what the hell happened to those bloody pictures
for ten whole days. Whether they were sitting in some chief
petty officer's in-basket or what, nobody knows. Sensitive
issue #3 that I remember: NSA in summer of '62, July or
August, I believe, put out an analysis (theoretically, they
weren't supposed to, but they did) of what all these Soviet

ships coming to Cuba and leaving Cuba--you know, we were

47


13-00000

“/

counting all these ships coming back and forth. It was a
regular parade. And NSA put# out an analysis saying the ships
are there to remove from Cuba all of the excess military
hardware the Soviets have put inf Well, obviously, at the
time of the missile crisis, NSA immediately asked everybody to
return this Top Secret’ COMINT-handled HVCCO and all that kind
of stuff. And all copies being recalled. Well, as good
officers, everybody always made copies of everything being
recalled. But there was another issue. What the hell was NSA
doing,doing analysis? And the question was whether they
should be prohibited in the future from doing analysis. There
were a lot of turf battles of this kind going on. I can go on
in terms of what was being kicked around in terms of
problems. You know, us operation guys; for example. Were we
concentrating on the right targets in terms of getting our
assets? The whole missile crisis began with a fluke, a pure
and utter fluke. And again, it took time because of the
method of getting the report. We had an agent in the Finan de!

precisely where it was, so he gave usjlittle towns. We

plotted the towns, and it turned out to be a trapezoidal
shape. But that report, which is the one which targetted the
U-2 and led to the overflight (and we in tee Operations
couldn't ask for the overflight. We had to ask our MONGOOSE

compatriots in G-2 who were involved in this thing and cleared

48


13-00000

for MONGOOSE, they had to ask for the overflight. We
couldn't. Don't ask me why, but those were the ground rules.
We couldn't ask for it. So we had to ask them). They came
over to our war room and I was in the.room when they plotted
the damn thing, and there was a trapezoid. But that report
took ten days to get to us. It was ae SW, secret writing, I
don't know what type of secret writing techniques he had--it
could have been lemon juice for all I know. It took ten days
for that to get to our chémists to develop the bloody paper.
To get the report. Before we could even see it. Now, why did
it take ten days? Well, international mail. I forget whether
he was mailing it to Spain or mailing it to Mexico, or what
have you, but anyway, that was the only route ‘that we had

out. Why didn't he have a radio? Big-argument, you know.
What about the size of the radios? You can't get the radios
in, and etc. etc. etc. But those were big arguments that
were going on. So there were those kinds of problems in terms
of the operators. Were we doing our job properly? Why didn't
we do it sooner, faster? Why didn't we learn about the
missiles coming in before this particular report?’ Well, you
had all kinds of reports about missiles. But where do you
draw the line? And the analysts of course were defending
themselves ‘in terms of; “you cut off your own report by
telling us it's 'feet' not ‘meters,' so we couldn't take that
on face value," etc., etc. So you keep on fighting about

these things. The Defense Department guys were being slammed

around, the G-2 guys particularly, for not cooperating better
with us in terms of combined assets on the island to find out
about these military pieces of hardware, and so on and so
forth, You name the problem and we were kicking it around.
And each time it was related to the Cuban missile crisis
itself. and it was a handy tool, if you wanted to hit
somebody over the head, to hit them with, and it was hard to
defend on a. lot of things. And all you could end up with was
saying, as I think the Senate Armed Services Committee ended
up with its report saying, that in retrospect, the
intelligence community as a community worked well, we
discovered the bloody missiles beforehand, before they were
ready to use, etc., etc. And the important thing about
this--and people keep forgetting it--is the worldwide
intelligence effort. -It's not just on one island of Cuba.
Even in the missile crisis. People forget about Penkovskiy.
Without Penkovskiy's 5,000 francs, we wouldn't have known what
the hell they were doing on the island. And I remember
talking to the photo man, and you can talk to--do you know

Brugioni?
No, I do not.

Well, talk to Dino. He's retired, and he's around here, and

he's a great guy.

I've read his article on this.

Well, without that report, without first of all the
trapezoidal report, we wouldn't have known where the hell to
send the U-2. Because even with the report--1I'll give you
another example, part of the fight of the port-mortem. During
the COMIREX approval, the overflights and all the flights had
to be approved. At that time, in October of "6a, the
overflights were limited to four flights a month. By whose
decree? State Department, I guess. But somebody had decreed
four flights maximum. And if weather. or mechanical failure,
or what have you, canceled any one of the flights, you didn't
save that flight for the next month. You had four a month,
whether you flew them or not. And so,-when the report of this
trapezoid came in and the G-2 people at our instigation asked
for an overflight of this particular spot on the western part
of Cuba, I'm told it took more than 10 days to get that
approved, to get the flight approved, because the State
Department representative--I don't know who he was, and I
never want to find out because I'd go shoot him--he said,
“No. We've been flying that part of the island all the time,
We haven't flown the eastern part for a long time. Let's fly
the east." And it took 10 days for the bureaucracy to argue
that out, so the flight could go where it's supposed to go.
So all of this was being kicked around at the missile crisis

post-mortem. I learned a lot sitting there. I was the junior

51


13-00000

officer present. You learn a lot listening to all this
stuff. As to what was going on in the bureaucracy, it was
fierce. I hope they've made changes. But anyway, all of
these things were surfaced on the table. Everybody was
arguing pros and cons. Some things were done, and approvals
and changes were made, stuff like that. One big change that
was made after that had nothing to do with that particular
committee.When Des took over from Harvey, because of this
reporting problem and the headquarters comments that were on
there and the fact that a lot of the reports that we had
provided from human sources were downgraded by the analysts
because a) it wasn't a picture, and b) it wasn't COMINT, so
without the two nothing else matters. Des had, and over the
objections of me, Bruce Cheever, and a-hell of a lot of other
officers in the Task Force (SAS by this time), asked for a
senior officer from DDI (I forget his name now but I think: you
can find it in the record) to come down and Des would make
available to him all-source information of each and every one
of our sources. True names, true positions, the whole
business. Never been done before. At least I'd never heard
of it. And Des wanted this very senior, well respected
officer, had been around years, to just sit. and look at who
our sources were. And to tell him frankly, are they worth
anything or not? As I say, we fought it and we argued with ~
Des and I think he didn't even ask--he was the kind of a guy

who wouldn't even ask--he didn't even ask Helms’ permission.

52


13-00000

He told Helms he was doing it, period. Helms said, “Okay,
give it a try." When this guy finished, he was amazed, and he
said, "You're downgrading your own sources by not putting in
better bylines to tell the analyst a little bit more if you
can." He said, “You've got some wonderful sources." And he
went back to his own people and told them that. And I must
say, he never, never, never, never once divulged a source. So
things like that came out of the missile crisis and came out
of the post-mortem committee. Of course Des heard a lot of
this stuff, he'd looked at a lot of this stuff, and he was
flabbergasted. So I hope other things were done the same.

The COMIREX thing got reorganized somewhat. And the State
Department didn't have that final clobber on it any more,

From four a month we went to practically four a day if we
could fly. We flew as a missions as we could fly. And
then of course the big fight between. the CIA flying it and the
Air Force flying it. And there was more sweat back and

forth. All of which was kicked around. I don't think anybody
kept any notes, I don't think anybody kept any minutes. A
final report was written and had more bloody cryptonyms on
that report than you can shake a stick at. I wasn't cleared
for half of them at the time, and I said that to sombody. And
they said, "Don't worry. At this stage of the game it doesn't
matter." The bulk of that report was actually then sanitized
and given to the Senate Committee--I think it was the Armed
Services~~and they used a good bit of that final report in

their final paper.

MSM: That's the Earman report.

SH: No, it was after the Earman report. The Earman report was the
first draft, kind of. And then we went to the USIB, the
conference, the big conference where poor Pat Carter got
clobbered. Then after that, we had to sit and make a final
report that McCone could give to the President. And also a

copy went to PFIAB. And that you ought to be able to find.
