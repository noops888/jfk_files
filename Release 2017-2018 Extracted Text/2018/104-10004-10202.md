We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA afa@ produce one very aignificant piece of information on Lee ~

OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico

City Station intereepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD made from someplace

in Mexico City to the Soviet Eubassy there, using his own naze. Speaking
broken Russian an& using his true name, OSWALD vas talking te the Esbassy

guard, OBYEDROY, who often answers the phone. OSWALD said he be@ visited

_ the Eubsssy the previous Saturday (26 Septenber 1963) and epoken to a

este! EN
gram for him to Washington. He wanted to know if there were “anything

new." The guard said if the conml wes dark it was (Valeriy Viedetrovich)

had gone out but no anewer had been received. He then hemg up.

messes ef telephone intercepts which are transexibed and reviewed by our

@mall staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone converaa-
tion of 1 Getober had been transoribed and a summary of it cabled to

Washington. ‘The name Lee OSWALD meant nothing special to our Mexico

City Station, but in their report they did judge him to be an American

male.

The cabled report was received in Weshingten on 9 October and checked

the Soviet Embassy in Nexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD who had
defected te the Soviet Union in 1959 end returned to the USA in 1962. On
10 Octever 1963, the day after the repart from Mexico City, CIA Headquarters
sent out a cabled report shout Lee OSWALD's phone call to the Boviet

Eubasay; the report went to the PBL, the Department of State (because .

OSWALD vas a US citizen), and to the Mavy Departuwent (because he wee a

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these egencies hizhlighted the

oe



13-00000

liklikeod that the Lec OSHALD mentioned was probably the former defectar.
A copy of this same cable was delivered by hand to the Dmiyration and
Haturelization Service, with which ve have no cable Link. ‘The same day

a leng cable went out to Mexico City informing our Station of the back-
ground of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for more information. Our Station
was instructed to pass its informtion on the phone call to the Mexico
City offices of the FBI, the Exbassy, the Reval Attache, and the Inuigra-
tion an? Returalization Service. This was done.

In its original report of 9 October, Mexico City hed seid it had 9

1 October 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A vary sensitive seperation
in Mexico City provides us with secretly taken photographs of many but not
all visitors to the Soviet Subassy there, taken with telephoto Lenses.
Accordingly, ve cabled the Navy Departuent on 24 October 1963 asking for

@ photograph of Lee OSWALD fram his Marine Corps days so we could compare ®

photes. We hed not received this photegraph by 22 November 1963, but in

any event, it turned out that the man photographed outside the Soviet

Eubessy was not OSWALD enyway. As chance woulé have it, cone of our

i several photo ebsezation points in Mexico City had ever taken an identi-
zl fiable pieture of Lee OSWALD,

to whom it will be passed. Only in absolute emergencies is the Mexico City
Station authorized to pass euch information directly to the FBI office in e
the U.S, Bubassy.

At this writing (13 December 1963) we do not know what action the FBI



13-00000

and other agencies may have taken based on our report. We surmise thet the

FRI may have made local checks through Mexican autherities te see if

Lee OSWALD was actually in Mexico City on 1 October. Indsed, Later in-

vestigation has confirsed all the details of bis trip, where he stayed,

end whet he did. fo avoid crogsing Lines with the FBI, cur Mexico Station

When worl ef the shooting of President Kennedy reached the offices
of cur operating divisions and steffs on the afternoon of Fridey 22 Hovea-
ber 1963, transistor radios were turned on everywhere to follow the a
tragedy. When the name of Lee OSWALD was beard, the effect was electric.

A phone meseage from the FAI came at about the same time, nawting OSMALD


13-00000

as the possible assassin and asking for traces. The message wes passed
on at onow by the Chief CI, Mr. Angleton, to Mr. Birch O'Neal of his
Special Investigations Unit. Mrs. Betty Egater of this Usit immediately
recoguized the name of Lee OSHALD and went for his file. At the case
‘time, Mre. Bustes of the Maxteo Desk, vho had written our first feport on
OSWALD on 10 Ooteber necognized the name frou radie reports end vent

our overness stations, and many pieces of information on OSWALD and his
wife had been received back. ‘The Mexico City Station researched its

were arrested and questioned about his activities, giving @ good picture

OGWALD's name was not actually mentioned in these edditfenal calls,
but similarity of speech end various plain points of content link then

A particularly sinister aspect ef CSWALD's dealings with the Soviets
in Mexice City erises from the liklikcod that he met with Soviet Consul
Velerfy Viedisirovich KOSTIMOV. In his 1 October phone call to the
Soviet Eabasay, the guard OBYEDKOV suzgests that the Consul OSWALD had
talked ta was KOSTIKOV if he was dark. OSWALD seems to agree with this,

but the identification is very casual. In his 9 Novesber letter te the

soit Re

Conmalate in Weskingten, OOMALD gives the neme of the man be dealt

with as “KOSTIN,” but there is no persen of that exact name in the Soviet
Babassy in Mexico City. KOSTIKOY fs accredited as a Consular Attache and
doen actually do « lot of consular work, but be is believed te be a
Soviet KGS officer, and it is believed thet he works fer Department 13 of
the KCB, the Department charged with sabotage and assassinations. ‘the
suspicion that KOSTIKOY is @ KGB officer arese from his work hebits, and

his association with other KGB officers. It wes haréeneé when it was

a8



13-00000

found that he handled a Soviet egent whe was trained to do sabotage
work and thet he turned this agent over te another KGB officer who is
definitely know te work for the 13th Department. It is generally true
in KGB work that sabotage agents are handled only by 13"Departuent
officers.

Embassy querd Ivan Ivanovich OBYEDKOY is himself believed to be a
EGE wan from previous assignments as a bodyguard and sureflleat. But
unless some direct evidence of Eoviet complicity is discovered, it is

most Likely thet OSWALD's dealing with KOR men OBYSDKOV end KOSTIROY was

‘aan in’ part Go
Seviet habit ef placing intelligence sen in the Embassies in positions
where they receive a large portion of the visitors and phone calla. All

of the five consular officers in the Seviet Embassy are know or suspected

intelligence officers. Certainly if GSWALD bad been a Soviet agent in :
training far an assassination assigment or even for sabotage work, the ®
Seviets would have stopped him from making open visits ané phone calls te

the Soviet Enbasay in Mexico after he tried it a couple of times. Our


experience in Mexico, stulying the Soviet intelligence service at clese
Yenge, indicates that they do make soue mistekss and are sometimes insecure

|
a in their methods, but that they do not persist in such glaring errors.

Some insight on the Cuban attitude toward the arrest of Silvie DUBAN
and the involvement of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained freu two intercepted phane calle made between Cuban President
Osvelée DORTICOS and Coben Ambassador to Mexico Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas on
26 -Hoveaber 1963, the day efter Silvia DURAN was released from her first

arrest. At O9:hO A that morning, President DORTICOS phoned the Ambassador

Anbases@or had sent in en the arrest of Silvia DURAN and the Lee OSWALD
ease. Tae whole conversation ie consistent with the theory that OSWALD
merely wanted a vies. The Ambassador did mention the altercation which
OSMALD had with Consul AZCIR, and he says that exican police bruised
Silvia DUPAN's arms a Little skaking her to impress her with the importance -
of their questions. They he@ asked her if she bad been intimate with

OSWALD and she had denied it. President DORTICOS twice asked Ambassador


SEGRET i

BERHAMDRZ whether the Mextaan police kad asked Silvia DURAN questions
about “mosey,” and the President apparently wanted te know whether the |
Merleants thought the Cubans bad paté OSWALD money. HERNANDEZ insisted
the Mexicans had not offered Silvia DURAN money, and DORTICOS gave
ws trying to put ecross his point. Presigent DORTICGS instructed
RERWANDEZ, to keep on questioning Silvia DURAN and ta phene him back.

At 7:39 FM that evening Ambassador HERRAMORZ did call President
DORTICOS back, saying he bad questioned “that person” again and she bas

nothing now te add. President DORTICOS returns to the issue of whether

ie ge ee eee

Consulate bed given money to the mant"that American.” But Aubassager
HERNANDRZ peraists in misunderstanéing DORTICOS, ensues in the usgative,
ané ssyst “Abselutely nothing was given te her.“ DORTICOS seems to give
up, end the conversation dies out efter a few more general recarks.

We de not know for sure stmt unde President DOBTICOS press for informe
tion about Cuben money passed te OSWALD, but rusors were current in Mexico

ané even, we understand, in the USA, that OSWALD had returned from Mexico

CGhty with about $5,000. Perhaps DORTICOS was trying te learn whether

the Kextoan police believed that the Cubaus kad finsnced OSWALD. In any

7 event, the Catan Goverment sent the Mexicans a stiff note of protest
over the arrest and detention of Silvie DUBAH, but the Mexicans

rejected the uote.
