According to these articles, the surety

company handling the master bond of the Teamsters has cancelled

it, effective 2/8/63, and numerous bonding companies contacted

allegations that Hoffa,

through Allen M. Dorfman (a close friend

insurance programs of the Teamsters Union.

We have now dis

continued these investigations on advice received from the

Criminal Division.
