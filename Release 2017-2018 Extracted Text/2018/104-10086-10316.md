‘RGTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

1. We would like to take time out in our investigation of the President's
assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.
Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only
major overseas reporter in the case. While this 1s partly dictated by the
facts of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked tHe¥eally outstanding per-
formance of Mexico City's major assets and the speed’, ‘peécision, and perception
with which the data was forwarded. Here it was.reldyéd within minutes to the
White House, ODACID, and ODENYY. ERY

2. Your LIBNYOY data, the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses
were major factors in the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really
ominous spectre of foreign bacicin age

——_—_ ee

3. We regret that we have beet able to send you so little information in
return, but we have not beemgivap ituch yet. We do know that Lee OSWALD denied
he had ever been to Mexico except for a jump to Ta Juana, We have quickly
screened the FBI reportg 6: the whole case but we do not yet have a copy for

retention. It does romise your sources. Basically, what the New Yo:
Times has printed about\pife report is all true.

3. We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO
L story was the most troublesome. They are still coming in.

+ DISPATCH

4, You have had good support from your liaison, but as usual the really
outstanding features were Mexico Station's famous generalship and the skill and
@evotion of its personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,
down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work
your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this trageay

with particular keenness, as did we.
