ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

We would like to take

time out in our investigation of the President's

assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.

the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only

overseas reporter in the case.

While this 1s partly dictated by the

of Lee OSWALD's life, we have not overlooked the really outstanding per-

formance of Mexico City's major assets and the speed, precision, and perception

with which the data was forwarded.

Here it was relayed within minutes to the

White House, ODACID, and ODENVY.

Your LIENVOY data, the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses

were major factors in the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really

ominous spectre of foreign backing.:

We regret

that we have been able to send you so little information in

return, but we have not been given nuch yet.

We do know that Lee OSWALD denied

ne had ever been to Mexico excopt for a jump to Tia Juana.

We have quickly

screened the FBI report on the whole case but we do not yet have a copy for

retention. It does not

promise your sources. Basically, what the New Yor

limes has printed about the report is all true.

3.

We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO

story was the most troublesome.

They are still coming in.

HMMW-12193

You have had good support

from your llaison, but as usual the really

outstanding features were Mexico Station's Lamous generalship and the skill and

devotion of its personnel.

Please convey our admiration to

all who participated,

down to the last technician, translator,

and monitor.

We know that

your station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy

with particular keenness, as did we.
