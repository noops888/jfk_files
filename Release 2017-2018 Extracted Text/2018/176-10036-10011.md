MAIN TRAFFIC ROUTE BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN AND THE AFRICAN CITY. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

ARMORED CARS AND COMBAT-READY TROOPS. THESE, TOGETHER WITH THE LONG-EXISTING

ROAD BLOCK WHICH HAS NOW BEEN STRENGTHENED BY TUNISIAN U.N. TROOPS ON THE AI

TERNATE ROAD TO THE COMMUNES, HAVE VIRTUALLY SEALED OFF THE NATIVE CITY. TRAFFIC
