Dear Mr. Carpentier:

In connection with its investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the death of President Kennedy, the Select Committee
on Assassinations requests access to all files and index refer-
ences pertaining to the following individuals:

1) MAURICE BISHOP, aka JOHN BISHOP, JIM BISHOP, and FNU
FIRGAULT. This name is most likely an alias and this
individual's true name is not known to the Committee.
Bishop was working in anti-Castro operations in the
early 1960s. He was also allegedly involved in a plot
to assassinate Fidel Castro in Chile in 1971 with An-
tonio Veciana and Luis Posada.

2) WIROGUE - CIA agent involved in the ZRRIFLE program.
Further identifying information on the following individuals

will be given orally, pursuant to an agreement between Bob Genzman
of our staff and Roger Gabrielson of your staff.

Whether or not any of the individuals listed below had
any relationship with the CIA, they may believe that actions
they have taken were at the direction of responsible persons
in the Central Intelligence Agency. Accordingly, in order for
the Select Committee to obtain truthful statements and ulti-
mately testimony from these individuals, it would be most use-
ful for the Committee to have a letter from your office re-
leasing these persons of any obligations of secrecy they may
have made to the CIA, or to anyone whom these individuals may
believe was affiliated with the CIA.
