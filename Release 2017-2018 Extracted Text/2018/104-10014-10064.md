WHICH MIGHT BE RAISED, NIKONOV PERSONALLY RE 498 FILES TO
DETERMINE IF LEE HARVEY ((OSWALD)) HAD BEEN A KGB AGENT. HE
REVIEWED FIVE THICK VOLUMES OF FILES GN GSWALD. NIKONCY IS Now
CONFIOENT THAT ZSWALO WAS AT NO TIME AN AGENT CONTROLLED BY THE
KG3. FROM THE GESCRIPTION OF OSWALD IN THE FILES HE DOUBTED
THAT ANYONE COULD CONTROL OSWALD, BUT NOTED THAT THE KBG
WATCHED HIM CLOSELY ANC CONSTANTLY WHILE HE WAS IN THE USSR.

HE COMMENTED THAT OSWALO HAO A STORMY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS
SOVIET WIFE, WHO RODE HIM INCESSANTLY. THE FILE ALSO REFLECTES
THAT OSwA.0 WAS A POGR SHCT WHEN HE TRIEO TARGET FIRING IN THE
USSR.

NIKONGV
PERSONALLY PERFORMED AN INQUIRY FOR BAKATIN INTO THE FATE OF
SWEDISH DIPLOMAT RAQUL ((WALLENSERG)). THERE IS STILL PRESSURE |
FROM THE SWEOISH SIOE TO HAVE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON THIS

MATTER BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING IMPORTANCE OF THE WALLENBERG i

EXECUTED LATE IN 1947, THERE WERE INCICATIONS THAT WALLENBERS
WAS SUSPECTEO OF HAVING CONTACTS WITH OTHERS WHO WERE ACCUSED

OF PROVIOING FALSE OIPLOMATIC IDENTITY DOCUMENTS TO OTHERS

BEYOND JEWS SAVEO FROM THE HOLOCAUST. AMONG THESE WERE NAZI

WAR CRIMINALS WHO WERE ALLOWED TO ESCAPE. THERE WAS NO PROGF

OF WALLENBERG'S GUILT IN ANY OF THESE CHARGES.
