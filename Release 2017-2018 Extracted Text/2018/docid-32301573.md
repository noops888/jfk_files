MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL
DE RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIO

On December 12; 1963, our source in this matter who
has furnished reliable information in the past learned that
William Johnson, a United States citizen, pilet and businessman
whe hes been previously involved in’ anti-Castro activities,
rented a twin-engine Beecheraft which {s scheduled to be used
in the bombing raid, This airplane is lorated at Broward ;
International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, rather than ;
at Orlando, Florida, as previously indicated. Some consideration
is being given, however, te using an Area Commander airplane
located at Broward International Airport instead of the Beechcraft. \

Orlando Bosch Avila, head of the Movimiento Hl
Insurrecioaal de Recuperacion Revolueionario (MIER), has |
indicated that there may ba some slight postponement of this
operation but he has not made any definite of a
change of schedule.
