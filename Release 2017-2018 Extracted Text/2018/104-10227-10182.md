Payments to Dependents of "Heroes_and

Ration GIN HEFT

See Paragraph.3

DIR 06846

1, Forwarded under separate cover {5 a Leting of all payments
presently being made by AMIRON to dependents of heroes and martyrs. In addition
to the AMIRON payments JMMAVE 10 directly payinz the widow of AMGLAD-1 (seo
reference) and #300 per month to the widew of AMCUSP-L.

2. It 18 considered most inadvisable to terminate benefits to theao
dependents especially so long as subsistence payments are ‘continued to dependents
of captured, missing and-deceased strike force personnel. If these fow payments
were discontiriued while the large group remained in a "pay" status the local
repercussions would-be loud and most’ embarrassing.

: 3. In any event it is difficult to arrive at a dollar figure that
would constitute an cquitable lump-sum settlement in such tases, © Instead it
1s ouggested that these payments be continued until such time as a decieton 1
reached on dependents of deceased strike force personnel and final -acttlements
be patterned after thoue decided on- for the sttike force group.
