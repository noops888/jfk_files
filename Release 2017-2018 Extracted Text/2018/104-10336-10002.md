Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board’s Requests for
Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

1am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA’s responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered — including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be __
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998,

The remainder of this letter is divided into two ro parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the”
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

- TAs identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,-
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CLA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CLA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic “take” from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE
Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 “A” Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

Informal Requests

Each of the following informal requests was previously made to CIA. For future
reference, they will be referred to by the “Informal Request” (IR) number provided

” below.

CIAIR-01 Personnel Assigned to Post from 1959-64 (see RIF 104-10065-10199).
This request is complete.

CIA-IR-02 Location of Cable Identified in JFK 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630.
This request is complete.

*“CIAIR-03 Full Computer Search for List of Documents in HTLINGUAL File.

‘CIA agreed to undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents in.
April 1997. To date, no response has been received by ARRB. All computer
searches for these documents should be documented in a formal letter for the
record.

“*CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton’s Files.

The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to
account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton’s files, the Review Board
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to
explore any subjects in Angleton’s files beyond those that may have pertained to
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided
by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any

_ additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the
disposition of Angleton’s files.

In addition, the ARRB staff’s review of the Mangold v. CIA files designated.
additional documents from those files as assassination records. These documents
are: Tab D, documents Nos. 95, 109-116, 120, and 121; and from the Denied

(C) Fixst, as an outcome of the Pike and Church Committees, all
HTLINGUAL files were destroyed. Copies that may have been made and put
into individual's files surface as the files are reviewed. The DO ran’a
search on the term “HTLINGUAL.” Some records were -identified as
destroyed. Some were not so marked but are not locatable under the job
number identified; however, given that there is no requirement to record
destroyed records under the federal statutes for disposition programs
and given limited resources for noting files destroyed, this is not
uncommon. The HTLINGUAL search further identified files because of
Freedom of Information Act queries; however, these were not HTLINGUAL
files per se, but files which contained the FOIA requester queries for
HTLINGUAL information. :

SUBJECT: Destruction of MHCHAOS and HTLINGUAL Records
ry

1. With regards to the MHCHAOS records, it is my und
standing that a Protective Order was placed on all MHCHAOS files
in June 1976 due to their involvement in the Halkin vs. Helms
Litigation. You advised that Mark Lynch, the attorney representing
Plaintiff in the case had recently narrowed the class action
definition to include only those individuals cited in the case meds,
as plaintiffs. It was your belief that the protect. erder could <
be amended to permit destruction of all other Spee YS Seser sould ry oe
MHCHAOS record system. Please undertake whatever action is re-
quired as soon as poseseaS so that the DO may destroy records under
an amended protective order.

ee In further discussion, you advised that the DO could
procede with the destruction of its HTLINGUAL records. Attached
please find five copies of Form 141, oech pertuining to a separate
phase of the HTLINGUAL file system. Please inctudle your con-
scurrence with the Geta hrelatdarcs of these files by signing in block 12
on all copies.

MEMORANDUM

September 19, 1998

To: Laura Denk
Executive Director
cc: Bob Skwirot
CIA Team Leader

From: Michelle Combs Pathe (Povo

Associate Director for Research and Review
Subject: CIA-IR-03 HTLINGUAL Records

The Review Board’s Informal Request for Additional Records and Information asked
the CIA to locate any extant records from the HTLINGUAL mail cover and mail
opening project. Most of the HTLINGUAL files held by the Directorate of Operations
were destroyed in 1990 at the order of the CIA’s Office of the General Counsel. A
memorandum for the record found in volume seven of Lee Harvey Oswald’s Office of
Security file states that the Office of Security destroyed its SRPOINTER/HTLINGUAL
files in April 1994 in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Record’s control
schedule and the Office of General Counsel.

The Review Board staff examined an index, provided by the CIA, to the remaining
HTLINGUAL records and marked folders for closer review. The Review Board staff
reviewed the HTLINGUAL project files for 1955-1990. These project files consist of
monthly statistical reports and administrative records. The more recent documents in
the files pertain to law suits, court orders, or destruction records. These files were not
designated as assassination records. The extant HTLINGUAL records for Lee Harvey
Oswald and several project “soft” or working files are included in the CLA sequestered
collection and have been processed as a part of that collection for inclusion in the JFK
Collection at the National Archives. Additional HTLINGUAL documents were located
in the archived files of the Deputy Director for Plans. Any documents relevant to the
assassination were designated assassination records and will be processed for inclusion
in the JFK Collection at the National Archives.
