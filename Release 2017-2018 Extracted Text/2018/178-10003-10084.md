Report to Policy Group, 11 April 1962
By Brig. Gen. Lansdale

We are in the fourth week of the Special Group's revised plan
for Operation Mongoose. There are fifteen more weeks of Phase I, : if
which is essentially intelligence collection with low U.S. visibility, Gq j

| Intelligence collection is reaching a point where the U.S. is

! starting to get a firmer fix in detail on order of battle, the political
structure, the economy, and internal resistance groups. Our Center

fe in Miami processed 1,309 refugees last week, The refugee debrief-

ing center in Max zidtis now in operation, Means for debriefing

visitors to Cuba, at a number of free world ports, have been estab-

lished. Mr. McCone can provide details.

& In the more dramatic sector, the infiltration of teams into Cuba,
CIA reports one team in place, a second team on the way, and two
~more ready-for-next-week, . “Lhe..pace.was.adjusted.to.ensure.that
i really competent personnel go in, It should be noted that this is
only one sector of the collection effort inside Cuba. Again, I defer
to Mr. McCone for details.
i
CIA has identified seven resistance organizations inside Cuba,
as realistically potential. A hard assessment, up close, is still to
come. Under the revised plan for Operation Mongoose, proposals
for supplying arms and equipment to these groups will _be submitted Av
to the Special Group for decision, ad hoc. No proposals have bee: have been
received,

On political activities, State reports that the Cuban government
was made aware that a deal for the prisoners could be made, through
the Italian UN mission. Also, as reported in the press, a refugee
delegation is seeing the Cuban government, to negotiate a deal. State-
ments calling for a fair trial and humanitarian treatment of the pri-
soners were stimulated from 9 Western Hemisphere chiefs of state
or foreign ministers, and in an OAS council resolution.
