Miami, Florida, advised on February 6-and 14, 1962, that
‘ he is a neuro-surgeon, presently working at the Jackson
Memorial Hospital in Miami. He said he received his
medical education in the United States, and that he re-
turned to Cuba in the summer of 1960 to begin his practice,
DEL CASTILLO advised that upon his return to Cuba he soon
became aware of the extent of the Communist domination
over the Cuban government, Soon after returning he took
steps to put himself in contact with the anti-CASTRO
underground groups operating in Havana, where he lived.

DEL CASTILLO DAVID/SALVAD in the fall of 1960 he

became acquainted with DAVIBASALVADOR, the founder of the 0 BA
C eee.

30th of November Movement. ‘Through SALVADOR he was able
to become a member of the group, and was placed in the
Professional Section. He said he continued his anti-
CASTRO activity with the 30th of November Movement until
November 3, 1961, when he was forced to seek asylum in
the Brazilian Embassy in Havana. He said he remained at
the Embassy for 51 days, when he was able to obtain
permission to come to the U.S., where he arrived just be-
fore Christmas.

Regarding the activity of the 30th of November
Movement in Cuba, DEL CASTILLO advised that it was divided
into 4 groups, namely: The Workers Section, the Profession-
al Section, the Student Section and the Farmers Section.
There was a coordinator supervising each section, and the
leader of the entire group was designated General Coordin-
ator. In addition, there was a coordinator for each

. being composed of individuals living in proximity to
each other. Each of the 4 groups was subdivided into
areas of operation, such as action and sabotage,
finance, Propaganda, supply and military. DEL
CASTILLO stated that the action and sabotage groups were
usually caught, and it was seldom that an individual could
remain in this activity more than 3 or 4 months.

A
At the time that he was active, the finance group *-

was charged with the responsibility of obtaining funds,
which was usually accomplished by the sale of bonds to
members or sympathizers, The propaganda activity, which
was handled on a cell basis, consisted mainly of the dis-
tribution of mimeographed sheets exposing the Communist
nature of the CASTRO government.

He stated that the supply activity was almost
nil in the last months of his activity, since there were
no supplies.

He stated that the military group consisted of
those designated to go to the hills and mountains, but
that very little act wity of such a nature actually took
place, due to the lack of resources,

DEL CASTILLO mentioned that the Farmers Section
of the 30th of November Movement was the weakest, since

He stated that the Workers, Students and Professional
Sections were well organized and that the 30th of November
Movement had groups in all 33 of the Labor confederations
of Cuba,

DEL CASTILLO stated that prior to the invasion
of April 17, 1961 by anti-CASTRO forces, the 30th of
November Movement in Cuba was very well organized in-all
Provinces. — In addition, prior to April 17, 1961, alliances
with other underground organizations had been made,

particularly among the préiftesionals,

DEL CASTILLO advised, however, that the under-
ground movement suffered a Severe setback following the
unsuccessful invasion of April 17, 1961. As a result
of mass arrests which followed the invasion, the 30th
of November Movement was seriously disorganized, and
there followed a period of almost total inactivity.

DEL CASTILLO stated that the movement was re-
covering its strength and reorganizing during the summer
and fall of 1961. “at this time, however, there were
several arrests made by the CASTRO government, including
the arrest of the General Coordinator of the Movimiento
Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP), described by DEL
CASTILLO as probably the strongest of the underground

organizations. He stated that following the arrest of REYNOL

GONZALEZ, the MRP disintegrated and as of the time he
left Cuba in December, 1961, it was of moO consequence,

DEL CASTILLO said that the 30th of November
Movement suffered a similar disaster shortly after the
arrest of GONZALEZ, when JULIAN REYES, @ young student
who had worked his way to the top echelon of the Student
Section of the 30th of November Movement , proved to be
an agent of the Cuban government. in the last days of
October, REYES turned in the names of many of the leaders
of the 30th of November Movement, including all of the
leadership of the Student Section, and consequently
many leaders and members of the 30th of November Move-
ment were arrested. Others were able to escape to
asylum in some of the Embassies in Havana, but the acti-
vitles of the organization were almost eliminated. DEL
CASTILLO stated that at the time this happened, he himself
was Vice Coordinator of the Professional Section of the
30th of November,

DEL CASTILLO advised that while he was in the
Embassy, he was able to maintain contact with the 30th
of November Movement in Havana by telephone, and that he

learned that despite the setback caused by REYES, meet=
ings were still being held, although no activity was
permitted for security reasons. He said that at the time
he left, the organization was inactive.

DEL CASTILLO stated he had received a letter from
a friend im the 30ch of November Mov t in Cuba, about
3 weeks ago, which indicated that e1 ts to reorganize
~the movement: were proceeding.

DEL CASTILLO advised that. the principal diffi-
culties encountered by the underground, during the last
few months of his act: Js were those imposed by the
vighlance committe ach block which made it impossible
to meet, and mpossible to plam. He said that
every movement viewed with suspicion and tl i
only because of hia position as a physictal
able to operate as a dinator in the Pro :
Section, He stated, however, that he was surveilied from
time to time, and was quently asked to exp]
had spent certain periods ‘of time.

DEL CASTILLO also menti i that another serious
problem for the underground was ¢ fioances, AS an
example, he pointed out that certai people whe devoted
their entire activity to underground work had to be
supported by the underground. He recal that during the
year and a half he was in the 30th of November Movement, the
group lost in one fashion or another, 82 automobiles. He
said that automobiles were vital to the éffective ‘operation
of the underground in the cities.

DEL CASTILLO stated that fear and the threat of
infiltration by CASTRO agents had serio ly paralyzed the
activities of the underground organizations, including the
30th of November Movement in Cuba, —

Que Regarding the operations of the 30th of November
Movement insthe U.S., DEL CASTILLO advised that CARLOS.

by the movement in Cuba as the General Coordinator, despite
the fact that others in Miami have differed with him and
tended to go their own way. DEL CASTILLO stated that
JESUS FERNANDEZ HERNANDEZ and ORLANDO RODRIGUEZ have been
at odds with RODRIGUEZ QUESADA for some months now. He
Stated, however, that during the last 2 weeks some definite
steps have been taken to resolve the differences between
them and to reunite the organization.

DEL CASTILLO advised that RODRIGUEZ QUESADA was
a_ strong anti-Communist labor leader in Cuba for about
15 years. He is not a well educated Person, but is a
persuasive speaker who commands great respect from labor-
ing people in Cuba. Despite his lack of education, DEL
CASTILLO described him as a person having a keen mind,
a good understanding of the Communist threat, and a
staunch friend of the U.S.
