MM: 92-88

Some time shortly before Christmas,

1968 when

TRAFFICANTE was visiting the home of EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL,

he received a telephone call from somewhere in New York

advising him that a respected member of the National Commission

of the La Cosa Nostra (LCN), an old man with a heart condition,

had been arrested in Canada.

On February 1,

1969, MM T-8 Stated that on Thursday

night, January 30, 1969, TRAFFICANTE met personally with

EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL and they spoke about the continuing FBI

harassment of EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL and the continuing interviews

of associates of EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL. They discussed the

possibilities of obtaining subpoenas. for all persons interviewed

in an attempt to obtain an injunction for harassment against

the FBI. TRAFFICANTE also advised EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL

that he would do whatever possible to get the Agent assigned

to the case reassigned

The LAZARO MILIAN DID trial has been set for

April 4, 1969. ARTHUR HUTTOE, local judge and

head of the

local Crime Commission has been a long time advisor and

confidant of TRAFFICANTE in criminal matters, HUTTOE has

advised EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL that Judge TURNER is in no

position to deny any request he may make but HUTTOE has

stated that he cannot publicly be seen with EVARISTO GARCIA

VIDaL and therefore suggested that PAUL LOUIS handle the

case He also suggested that any "political donations" for

him be made to LOUIS. HUTTOE has stated that he has access

to law enforcement files as well as many highly-placed

political contacts.

On February 3, 1969, MM T-8 advised that CARMEN

MARIA CARRIO visited the home of EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL several

nights previously and was accompanied by a girl friend,

MARIA: DEL CARMEN PEREZ, also known as CARMEN PEREZ. PEREZ iS

in her

early twenties, has long dark hair, straight, shoulder

length

and.

wears the latest style mod clothes and boots.
