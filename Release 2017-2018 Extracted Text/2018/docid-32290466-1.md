ADMINISTRATIVE:

Kok into and on te and that noy had on o

In New York for about four days and that they had had an

appointment with someone outside of New York City.

on 1-18-68, SD 1064-C-TE advised that subject

had been in Los Angeles during early part of Jan. , and

had

talked with ICN member, JOHN ROSELLI, and learned from

ROSELLI that TRAFFICANTE had been in touch with ROSELLI

while in the Los Angeles area.

Informant stated TRAFFICANTE

was traveling with an unknown male and that they were on

their way to Japan and Hong Kong, and according to ROSELLI,

TRAFFICANTE suggested that ROSELLI "take over" LCN leader-

ship for the entire state of California, as the present

leaders in the Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose

families were ineffectual.

CG 6588-C-TE advised that PHIL ALDERISIO had

supposedly contacted TRAFFICANTE telephonically at Tampa,

indicating that ALDERISIO would be in Tampa in the near

future and would contact TRAFFICANTE. ALDERISIO has

mentioned that he will be in Miami on Feb. 27, for the

opening of the Parkinson Disease Drive and plans to be in:

Tampa before going to Miami.

TP 120-C has advised that, although did not

actually personally see SANTO TRAFFICANTE, from Jan. 3,

until Jan. 24, informant knows, for several reasons,

that TRAFFICANTE was actually in Tampa sometime between

the night of Jan. 6 and the afternoon of Jan. 8. Informant

has stated that when SANTO returned to Tampa on Jan. 23-24,

he spent the next several days at the house, suffering

from the flu and did not leave the house until Tuesday,

Jan. 30; when he and Mrs. TRAFFICANTE left

indicating

would be gone for several days.

TP 120-C stated that TRAFFICANTE's daughter,

MARY JO,

and her husband, AUGIE, left Tampa, Thursday,

Jan., 11;

to attend the Super Bowl in Miami on Jan. 14, -

and that theywent to the Bahama Islands, New Orleans,

back to Miami, and then to Tampa. Informant stated that

during the entire time MARY JO and her husband were gone

on their trip, Mrs. TRAFFICANTE remained at the Tampa

residence and that, apparently the original plans were for

Mrs. TRAFFICANTE to be off on a trip with SANTO, while

J0 and her husband were in the Miami area. Informant

MARY

mentioned that, during the time Mrs. TRAFFICANTE was in

Tampa while the rest of the family

were away, she spent

much of the time crying and seemed to be in a very depressed

state of mind. Informant stated that SANTO's brother, SAM's,

wife, ELSIE, came to the house on several occasions to

talk with Mrs. TRAFFICANTE over some family problem and that

ICANTE

on, at least one such occasion, SAM's wife had been accompanied

by JIMMY LONGO's wife.

On 2-10-68, TP 120-C advised that TRAFFICANTE

returned to Tampa on

2-5-68, in the evening and remained

in Tampa until 2-8-68.

•: Information from the records of General Telephone

Co., of Florida,

Tampa, Fla., was made available by Mr.

JAMES E. MCMAHON.

Investigative period of this report extends beyond

the date of last report due to desire to include results

of investigation conducted by an auxiliary office, which
