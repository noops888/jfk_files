Findings:

3. There is voluminous material on Mr. de Mohrenschildt in CIA
files, most of it dating from the post-Kennédy assassination period

5. Hr. Helms' 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the liarren Commission on
the de Mohrenschiidts is attached at C, It describes the Agency's --
interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now
Domestic Coliection Division - DCD) had its resident agent in Dallas,
Mr. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschildt at that time. The
history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt from 1957
to 1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested
traces on fir. de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached at D) con-
tained.sufficient derogatory information to preclude further, extensive
contact with the de Mohrenschildts. (An OS summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt
prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

6. Our files shaw that a mail cover was ‘placed on letters addressed
to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to
1966. (This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-
vestigations.) This included opening and photographing the contents of
some letters by the CIA there. The results of this operation
were shared with the FBIT

7. Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during
the Rockefeller Commission investigations. We were asked to respond to a
memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA
Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for
an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and
asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de
Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is
attached at E.

8. The most recent information we have on Mr. de Nohrenschildt comes
from Mr.-J. Walton Moore wha was contacted in May and duiy 1976 by writers
connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell
Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and
Mr. de Mohrenschildt. lr. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached
at F.

ad poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have
aised serious questions. Certainly his relationship with the
swalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this
gency and the FBI to spend more time and energy.on him in the past
han was necessary.

10. Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their
nterests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late
960's. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could
ither be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-
ives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination
# President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond
ir. Moore's reports attached at F. What we can say is that we have
ound no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active
nterest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.
