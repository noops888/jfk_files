6. Our files show that a mail cover was placed on letters addressed

to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to

1966:

•(This was probably not uncovered

at the time of the external in-

vestigations.) This included opening and photographing the contents of

some letters by the CIA

there. The results of this operation

were shared with the FBI. a4

de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during

the Rockefeller Commission investigations.

We were asked to respond to a

memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA

Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for

an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and

asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de

Mohrenschildt about him.

Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission

8. The most recent information we have on Mr. de. Mohrenschildt comes

from Mr. J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers

connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell

Publishing Company.

Both writers questioned Mr.

about Oswald and

Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mir. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached

at F.

Mir. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an

adventurous and

colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman.

Both the Fbl and this Agency, however, had dropped their

We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond

Ir. Moore's reports attached at F.

What we can say is that we have

ound no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

nterest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.
