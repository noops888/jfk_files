MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT

: Australian Press Reguest Regarding:

Anonymous Telephone Calls to United States

Embassy in Canberra, Australia, Relative to

Planned Assassination of President Fennedy

(Warren Commission Document 971)

Background

VI. Peter Michelmore, an Australian newspaper representative,

has requested that we declassify CD971. This consists

of a memoran.-

dum from you to Mr. Rankin dated 22 May 1964 and an attachment dated

29 November 1963. Both relate to "crank" calls received by the U.S.

Naval Attache in Canberra on 15 October 1962 and 23 November 1963.

CIA first was told about these calls on 24 November 1963 by the Depart-

ment of the Navy - after the assassination of President Kennedy. A

copy of CD971 is attached for your information.

Recommendation

1. CD971 should not be released at this time. Mr. Goodwin says

he can handle the reply by phone.

2. We will initiate preparatory steps toward releasing CD971. This

intails clearance with U.S, naval intelligence and the Australian securit

service (the latter as a matter of courtesy).

3. Upon completion of step 2, 've will submit an appropriate rec-

ommendation.
