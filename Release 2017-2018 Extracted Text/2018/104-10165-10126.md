CITATION
CAPTAIN LUCIEN E CONEIN, ©2336769, Enfertry, Ammy-of~tte~Uribed-Gboveonieewerced

the cessation of hostilities cn 15 August 1945, when he commanded a commando

team composed of smerican, Prench and Chinese:personnel with the mission of
gsthering intelligence aud harassing the enemy in French Indo-China. Captain
Cooein was responsible for the selecting, training and organizing of thisteam

as well as the plaming cf the attacks on Japanese headquarters and garrisons t
of French Indo China, and the successful execution of the mission. Captain :

:
Conein An planning the mission made, seven days prior ‘to the operation, a |
reconnaissance of the route to be taken by his team through territory heavily |
covered:b; Japanese patrois int garrisons. The intelligence which he gathered !
on this reconnaissance was of inestimable value to the success-of the mission :
and in the minimizing of casualities in his forces. ‘hen he was threatened by

attack from Japanese forces and advised to abandon this area by local military

camanders, he chose to remain 2nd defend his position against advancing colums. |
of Japanese comming from the north and west. His achievements reflect great
¢redit. upon himself andthe Armed Forces of the United States.
