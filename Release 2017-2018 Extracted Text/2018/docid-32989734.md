\seueae a I have considered this matter, diseussed it with”
appropriate ‘a-ent and supervisory personnel of tha Mobile
Offlee and the Pollowings is proposed as a counterinte Lituence
move on KING 'g Washington Spring Project.

KING has quite a following in and around the etna,
Ala, area and has appeared ber anered in Selma on one aceagion
at the church of Reverand L. L. ANDERSON, who, at vhe time of
i KING's apgearance, uas running for mayor of Selma. ANDERSON,
was tentatively endorsed by KING and was subsequently defeated
in his race for mayor of Selina.

i Reverend FREDERICK DOUGLAS REESE, who is head of

i : the [nllas County Voters Leazue and is quite influential among
the Nesro community in the Selm area, did not endovse ANDERSON
for mayor and informed sources indicate he more or less con-
tributed to the defeat of ANDERSON. REESE has keen knoyn to

| make cerozatory remarks concerning KING and was alleredly

i miffed that KING did not advise him, REESE, or Bad KING s,

i gontempla ted visit to Selma.

i : In ylew of the above, “4% ds felt that if some
method can be devised whereby REESE can be advised of certain
items rélative to the Washington Spring Project, he would take
action to Giscoweage individuals from participating therein.

i - Bureau REGISTERED

Eb is not believed that REBSE could be contacted
by a Bureau Agent, although he his on oecasion furnished us
information which has proven to be reliabie. ‘

It is, therefore, proposed that an anonymous letter
be directed to REESE at his home address, 1566 Ranpe, Selma,
Alabama 35701, wherein it is called to the attention or REESE
that KING is merely using the Negroes of the Selma area for
his own personal aggrandisxement; that he is not genuinely
interested in their welfare, but only in their donations; that
in all probability the individuals going to Washington for
the Spring Project will be left stranded without suitable
housing or food. The letter should also play up the possibili-
_ty of violence, particularly the fact that althouch CARMICHAEL
and BROWN of SNCC have a so-called gentlemens' agreement with
KING not ta take over this action, there exists a strong
possibility that such will occur, There is also the possibili-
ty of RAM and NOI taking over the project since it lacks
organization and direction, The letter should also peint out
that KING was in Alabama on about 3/21/68, and did not make
‘his schedule in the Selma and adjoining counties area, which
was another indication that KING was talking out of both sides
of his mouth.

It is felt that this letter should be mailed from
either Washington or Baltimore since, if the letter is mailed
from anywhere in the south, REESE may feel it is the work of
the Klan or some other racist sroup. It is felt that Baltimore
would probably be the best since a letter from Washington would
indicate the possibility of the government doing this.

Simultaneous with mailing the letter from Baltimore 7
it is proposed that a copy of the detter to REESE. together
with a cover letter, be mailed to ROSWELL FALKENBERRY,_ Editor
and Publisher, Selma Times-Journal, Selma, Alabama. ‘he cover
letter should indicate that attached was a letter directed to
REESE and that he, FALKENBERRY, might want to contact REESE
relative to REESE's receipt oft the letter and what it said.

The thought behind this is to glve FALKENBERRY a
chance to interview REESE concerning receipt of the letter ~
and thereby create a nevs story whi ch could legitimately be
published and read by the Nero community inthe Selua area,

It is known that the Selma Times-Journal has a large circula-
tion amon; the Negro community in Dallas and adjoining counties
and has taken a rather liberal attitude in connection with
elivil rights movements.



~ NW.54987 Docld: 32989734 Page 7

By pandling as above, we would eliminate the
possibility of thege rumors being attrkbuted to the FBI.

Consideration has been given to some method of
discouracinz ALBERT TURNER, who is vPleld Secretary for KING s
project, “and is spsareheading the recruitment throughout our
territory and other portions oi Alabama. From our contact
with TURNER, who is a linison source, it is the opinion of
contactin: agents that he is so sold on the project that it
is almost impossible to disillusion hin.

Tt is algo felt that some method of _pettang an
article in the “Southern Courier* along the lines of the above.
would have a discouraging effect on the Negro community in
and around Montzomery, Ala,, since the courier is very widely
read, Consideration is being given to the method of accom
ae this. :

Piantanssenaar Reference is made to Burean airtel to aban,

ies ’ SA JOSEPH T. “BOSTON has been ee to
coordinate this program in the Mobile Division. :

‘As the Bureau has been separately advised, in-
vestigation has not been developed that any militant Black.
Nationalist group has been in existence in the Nobile
territory. ‘There has been no activity of The Revolutionary
Action Movement (RAH), Congress of Racial Equality (CORS),
or Nation of Islam (NOL). The Southern Christian Leadership
7 Conference (SCLC) has representatives in this division, but

no organizational headquarters or office, The Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) has representatives
coming to the Mobile Division periodically, particularly

coming to Selma, Tuskegee or Hontgomery, ala, but investi~ :
gation has not shown that Succ has any offices in this territory.

The Lowndes County Freedom Organization (LC¥O),

- which is also known as the Lowndes Sounty Freedom Party and
the Black Panther Party, is a Hegro civil _ rights organization
established in Alabama November, "1965. % is a political
party, designed to: run candidates for pubis office. It. has
received publicity as the Black Panther Party, but is not
affiliated with the Black Panther Party established in New

: There has been no information developed to show
that violence is Sevres or expected by persons active in
the racial and civil rights matters.

: There is only one person on the agitator index
who might be the subject of future counterintellizence by
this office. This individual is JOHN EDVJIN JACKSON, Route 7 7
1, Box 191, Hayneville, Alabama. He is a Negro male, born
2/7/48, and is employed as a farmer. Kuch of the militant
Civil rixhts activity in Lownjes County, Ala., is believed

traceable to JACKS i, and he is a contact of STOXOLY
CARMIGHARL when CARMICHAEL eomes to Lowndes Gunty.

Investigation is being conducted at the present
time to determine If SNCC reopens an office at Selma, Ala.,
which was maintained by SNCC. in the past. If this office
is reopened to direct SNCC activities, then that office would |
be a logical tarket for counterintelligence activities.

Concerning suggestions for the over all counter-~

. intelligence action, it is felt that the Bureau might consider
. the creation of a paper Nezro nationalist group for the

--- purpose of drawing together militant Teaders and militant
g@roups in order to plant seeds of dissension among such leaders. ‘It
also should be considered that counterintellisence action
‘ gould be aimed against radical racial leaders in any organization
, '.. by the use of reliable press contacts being given information
" which would serve to discredit these leaders. Such infor-
mation, indicating that leaders are using the civil rizots
movenent for their ow gain and are not instituting programs
aimed at encouraping a Negro to help himself, could be used
throush reliable press contacts or responsible national
Negro leaders. This type of action might serve to bring about
a feeling of distruct among radical Nexro leaders.

Specific suggestions, as may be developed for
. possible use in the counterintelligence field, will be sent to
‘the Bureau by separate letter. Guarterly letters will be
submitted as suggested. ©

Re Mobile letter to Bureau, '3/27/68.

1. Operations Under Consideration

Since submission of referenced letter, a
new organization has developed at Montgomery,
Alabama, which could be a primary target of
counterintelligence action, The Young Mens
Progressive Committee (the organization is in
the process of changing its name to Youth
Progressive Committee), was started at Mortgomery,
with about 15 members at the present time and is
reliably reported as an affiliate of SNCC. It
is opening a bookstore as a memorial to Dr.
MARTIN LUTHER KING and is setting up a bar, both
: of which are reportedly means to raise money for
SNCC. It is contemplated that action against
this group can be taken through local police
authorities and state liquor authorities concerning
the operation of the bar and concerning reported
information that some members of this group carry:

RE; COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM
100-448006

The Bureau authorized furnishing the source data

on a confidential basis and the show appeared 7/7/68. A
great deal of research was done by Miami Agents and it
resui’ed in an excellent program. The show, which ended
with quotes from the Director on the nature of the New
Left, was so well received that the television station
received requests for a film of the show by local civic
groups. 7

As you are aware publicity about New Left
and black nationalist groups, especially television
coverage, sometimes enhances the stature of these groups. |
At the same time, Miami has demonstrated that a carefully
planned television show can be extremely effective in
showing these extremists for what they are. Local New
Left and black nationalist leaders were interviewed on

_ the show and seemed to have been chosen for either their

inability to articulate or their simpering and stupid
appearance,

Miami furnished a film of ‘thisshow for Bureau
review and it was apparent that the television source
used the very best judgment in editing comments by
these extremists. He brought out that they- were in
favor of violent revolution without their explaining
why. But he also brought out that they, personally,’
would be afraid to lead a violent revolution, making
them appear to be cowards. The interview of black
nationalist leaders on the show had the leaders seated,
ill at ease, in hard chairs. Full-length camera shots
shawed each movement as they squirmed about in their
chairs, resembling rats trapped under scientific
observation.

Each counterintelligence office should be
alert to exploit this technique both for black nationalists
and New Left types. Miami learned from sources that those
who appeared on the show realized that it presented them
in a most unfavorable light., One even complained to the
television station about it. This counterintelligence
operation will be of great value in the South Florida area

and the Bureau hopes these results can be duplicated in
other offices. Success in this case resulted from hard
work and acumen on the part of the Agents who handled
‘the matter. Especially important was the choice of
individuals interviewed as they did not have the ability
to stand up to a professional newsman, The fine job of

was also most important.

Re Mobile letter to Miami dated 8/23/68.

Enclosed for Mobile is a copy of an article
which appeared in the August, 1968, edition of "The Liber-
tarian Watchdog", an underground "“hippie-type" newspaper
published in Miami, Florida. ROBERT E, SCHWARTZ, the editor
of this publication was one of those interviewed on the
television program referred to in referenced letter.

The July 9, 1968, issue of "The Atlantic Sun",
a student publication at Florida Atlantic University,
Boca Raton, Florida, contained an article concerning this
television program. It quoted JAMES AGUT, also interviewed
on this program, as complaining of the editing of this pro-
gram. He claimed the program's bias was clearly shown by
the Director's remarks at the end of the program.

The television producer said the response to this
program was so good that they went to the expense of repro-
ducing it so it could be made available to a number of
eivic organizations who have requested it for local showing.
They gave one copy of the film to the Miami Office, at no
cost, and this has been sent to the Bureau.

This program was given considerable advance publi-
city and was shown at 6:30 PM on a Sunday evening which is
considered "prime time",

oa Other specific reactions of a positive nature on
a program of this type are difficult to assess, and probably
cannot be fully assessed for a considerable time.

Four staff members of HSCA recently completed
interviewing a number of RCMP personnel at RCMP Headquarters who
had been associated with the James Earl Ray investigation in
Canada. According to RCMP sources, nothing unusual was discussed
and the members were not asked any questions that would indicate
that any new material had been uncovered by the staff members,
who were very amiable and courteous throughout the contacts.

The RCMP is now in the process of contacting approxi-
mately 50 residents of Canada,who were interviewed by the RCMP
during the course of the investigation, to determine if they would
be willing to be interviewed in Canada by HSCA staff members.

The Canadian Government has taken the position that
no federal employee, with exception of RCMP personnel, can be
made available for interview and, therefore, people such as the
person(s) who accepted application for and issued Canadian

passport cannot be interviewed.

office is not being operated very effectively. From our
sources, as well as the Police Department in Baltimore, the
entire project has simply not been making any headway. For
this reason, it is felt that at this time it would not be
desirable to give KING and the Washington Spring Project
any publicity of any kind which might reflect reaction in
his favor. Baltimore, therefore, recommends that this
possibility be kept in mind and if at a later date, the
Washington Spring Project does get off the ground, then
consideration would be given to the suggestions as set out
in these referenced communications.

RACIAL INTELLIGRICE

(UASHINGZON SFRING PROJECT) ; :

Sources of this office connected with the
Washington Spring Project (WSP) in Baltimore have indicated
that the VSP has not gotten off the ground yet. These
sources have reported in general terme that it was their
impression that one of the recsons for this failure to make
adequate progress is the lack of assurance of MARTIN LUTHER
EXNG in particular, that if any arrests are made during
the project, bails money and attorneys will be promptly
furnished. This wag confirmed by the Intelligence Unit
ef the Baltimore City Police Department.

Hore sopacifieally, a source reported that the
v5 Tetlouxl Acsoclation Yor The Advancement of
Colored People here in Baltimore contacted the WSP with
this specific question in ming, No adequate assurance
was given by the WSP office.

It is not know by Baltimore that this is a
‘unique situation for this office. It is suggested that
if a similar situation exists in other divisions that some
considcration be giver for a counterintelligence operation.

Re Bureau airtel to Albany dated 3/4/68.

7 1. The identity of the Special Agent assigned to
coordinate the captioned program in the Baltimore Office
is SA FRANCIS J. WALSH.

2. The black nationalist movement in the territory
of the Baltimore Office consists of the following:

The Cambridge Black Action Federation (CBAF)
was organized in 9/67 at the suggestion of General GEORGE
GELSTON, Adjutant General, Maryland National Guard, when he
was contacted by a group of Cambridge, Maryland, Negroes who
desired a way to make public the grievances of the Negro
community in Cambridge. It is a local groun with no national
affiliations, and there are no membership requiremeuts,.

It is estimated that there are only about 15 persons who are
actually considered members, but it presumes to speak for the
Negro community in Cambridge. It maintains contact with civil
rights groups both in Baltimore and Washington, D. C. Some
persons associated with this organization were known to possess
shotguns and rifles used during riots in 7/67, according to
Chief of Police in Cambridge. The persons associated with this
group were apparently active in those riots.

a

The Civic Interest Group (CIG), Baltimore,
Maryland, was originally an organization of students and other
persons who were active in legitimate civil rights activity
in the Baltimore area, However, within the past few years the

name Civic Interest Group is being used by approximately 7
or 8 individuals led by VERNON (TIM) COMIAY. According to
BA 1391 R(PROB), this is not a membership organization and
publicity put out by CONWAY greatly exaggerates the alleged
number of members of the organization. The persons
associated with the CIG are currently working closely with
representatives of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC), who are organizing the Washington Spring
Project in the Baltimore area. BA 1391 R(PROB) advised that,
the CIG is used primarily by COMIAY, members of his family,
and several other people to pressure local authorities for
funds to pursue anti-poverty projects which are beneficial
to the CONJAYS. One individual associated with this group
at the Black Power Conference in 10/67 suggested that black
people arm themselves and be prepared to die. This group
has not been involved in any raciel disturbances as far as is
known.

The Nation of Islam (NOI) has Temple #6 at
Baltimore, Maryland, and Temple #35 at Wilmington, Delaware.
Both temples follow the teachings and directives of ELIJAH
HUHANMED. Temple #6 has an estimated 200 members; Temple
#35 has an estimated 45 members. Persons associated with these
groups have not been engaged in any acts of violence and are
not known to possess any weapons nor have they participated .
in racial disturbances. ‘The head of Temple #6 is CLYDE X, JONES,
aka CLYDE X, RAHAMAN. The leader of Temple #35 is Minister
CARL X, HARDEN.

The Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee
(sNcc) recently opened an office in the 400 block of East
North Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, which is headed by ROBERT
B, MOORE. MOORE is originally from Baltimore and several
years ago was active in Union for Jobs or Income Now (U-JOIH) »
the Baltimore community action arm of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), MOORE was one of the speakers at meetings
held at Morgan State College in 3/68, the day before the college
was closed down for two days due to student demands.

2.

NW 54987 DocId:32989734 Page 45 a ie el



BA 157-2520

The principal organization connected with the student
demands at Morgan State College was the Society of Afro-
American Students (SAAS), a newly formed group of about 25
students of Morgan State College, which according to sources
was apparently formed with the advice of ROBERT MOORE.

The most active black nationalist group in the
Baltimore area is the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)
Target City Project. In the spring of 1966 a group of persons
on the national staff of CORE came to the Baltimore area and
took over the direction of civil rights activity which nad
been originally started by the local CORE chapter. This group
called themselves the Baltimore Target City Project. As a
result of their activity, the great bulk of the local CORE
chapter severed their connection with CORE and formed a new
organization which they called the Activists for Fairy Housing.
They are now known as the Activists, Incorporated. Persons
associated with the CORE Target City Project have directed
or participated in practically all civil rights activities
in the Baltimore area, and they were also connected with the
activities in Cambridge which resulted in riots there. A
number of the activities of the CORE Target City Project
in Baltimore have resulted in errests and in some cases of
persons associated with the CORE Target City Project being
charged with inciting to riot. Several persons associated
with CORE who have been more outspoken in favor of violence
than suited the CORE National Office have apparently been
discouraged from participating in CORE activities.

Recently information has been received reflecting
that a school called the "Soul School" has been organized by
two individuals reported to be VISTA workers, LESTER VALLEY
and ALLEN NESBITT: WILLARD DONOVAN DIXON and BENJAMIN MC MILLAN,
two local individuals who worked closely with the CORE Target
City Project, are now associated with the Soul School. Both
of these individuals were censured in the latter part of 1967
because of their advocacy of violence in a iocal CORE public-
ation, and it now appears that they are no longer associated
with CORE.

BA 157-2520

In early February 1968, several representatives of
the National Office of the SCLC opened up an office at 604
West Mosher Street, Baltimore, Maryland, from which is being
organized the Washington Spring Project, which is also referred
to as the Poor People's Campaign. Members of the CIG have
been working closely with these people, but all elements of the
Negro community in the Baltimore area are being contacted by
the SCLC representatives,

The black militant nationalists who are currently
on the Agitator Index of the Baltimore Office are as follows:

LEMUEL DARNELL CHESTER, JR., a 20 year old Negro
resident of Cambridge and the leader of the CBA. CHESTER is
currently awaiting trial for inciting to riot at Cambridge,
Maryland.

DANIEL W. GANT, a 34 year old Negro, who is currently
director of the CORE Target City Project at Baltimore and who
has for a number of years been a member of the staff of
national CORE. GANT has led numerous civil rights demonstrations
in the Baltimore area. He is an intense effective speaker who
has spenaifically advocated violence if necessary to obtain
elvil rights objectives. :

STUART NORMAN WECHSLER is a 25 year old white man,
who is currently Assistant Project Director of the CORE Target
City Project and has been for a number of years a national
staff member of CORE. He has led numerous demonstrations in
Baltimore and has been charged with inciting to riot both in
Cambridge, Maryland, and in Baltimore, Maryland.

3. The following are orgenizations and individuals
whom it is believed should be considered for current counter-
intelligence action:

The CBAF in the event it again becomes active, because
of past activities of its leaders, LEMUEL DARNELL CHESTER, JR.
and ELAINE SAMPSON ADAMS.

The CIG because of the propensity of its leaders to seize
opportunities for their own gain in connection with civil

rights activities. The principal individuals who should be
considered in connection with this group are its Director
VERNON CONWAY and its Chairman JAMES PRETTYMAN,

CORE Baltimore Target City Project and its
leaders DANIEL W. GANT and STUART NORMAN WECHSLER because
of their activities in the past. |

SNCC and its Baltimore leader ROBERT B. MOORE
because of the past activities of national SNCC leaders in
advocating and inciting violence.

The Soul School and the four persons mentioned
above as being associated with it because of the known
propensity for violence of DIXON and MC MILLAN and because
local police suspect it of activities less innocent than the
teaching of Negro history and culture,

The SAAS in the event it continues activities of a
disruptive nature at Morgan State College because of its
apnarent connection with SNCC.

Re Bureau airtel to Albany, 3/4/68; and Baltimore

1, Operations Under Consideration

The Soul School, Baltimore, Maryland, is presently
being considered as a target for counterintelligence operations
by the Baltimore Office. This school purports to exist for
the purpose of teaching black history and culture. Black
militants who are associated with the sehool are considered
among the most dangerous in the Baltimore area. Gonsideration
is being given to the possibility of bringing to the attention
of the Negro community the unsavory backmsrounds of some of
these individuals who are setting themselves up as educators
of the black community.

2. Operations Being Effected

No operations are presently being effected by the
Baltimore Office. ‘the suggestion submitted by Baltimore
airtel dated March 8, 1968, was not put into effect at that
time because the Poor People's Campaign (PPC) was getting
off to a poor start, The slaying of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,
on April 4, 1968, made it inadvisable to carry forward any
further plans to disrupt the PPC by the means suggested.

3. M@angible Results

There have been no tangible results in connection with
this program in the Baltimore Division to date,

SUBJECT: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC) has recently opened an office in Baltimore, Maryland,
in connection with the proposed march on Washington by
SCLC. A racial source of this office has advised that
prominently displayed in the office are photographs of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, MUHAMMED ALI ead CASIUS CLAY. Copies
of the publication "Muhammed Speaks" and other literature

, of the National of Islam (NO1) are available in this office.
Additionally, there is indication that a representative of
the NOI in Baltimore has been in contact with SCLC represen~
tatives here.

It is recalled that in 1966, KING and BLIJAH
MUHAMMED were not able to resolve their differences at a
widely publized meeting of the two.

At the present time, the SCLC is making very poor
progress in either getting organized, finding sufficient
people with funds to back the project, and in general
finding enough residents in Baltimore to go along with the
idea of such a march, Again according to our source, the
leaders of the SCLC here are talking of picking a particu-
lar area of the City of Baltimore and concentrating on that
area to gain support with the thought that thereafter to
spread to other parts of the city.

Sources have advised this office that the
presence of literature and photographs connected with the
NOI, along with KING, have raised the question as to where
all the money is going to in connection with this and
other projects.

Attached to this airtel is a sketch of a suggested
leaflet. It is requested that this be considered by the
Bureau and that a refinement of this sketch be made with
either a photograph or possibly a caricature and that a
sample copy be furnished to this office. It is specifically
noted that this office does not desire to use this leaflet
at the present time; but, '. if the SCLC does make any head-
way in a particular section in Baltimore City then this
office would make a recommendation of anonymous distribution
of this leaflet in quantity.

2, The active, biack nationalist movement in the

territory of the Birmingham Field Division is

{NOI}, Birmingham.

This Mesque has an estimated membership of about
@5 members, It has the normal activity of an NOI Mosque;
three meetings a week and occasional social affairs open
to the public.

Birningham's estimate is that this Hosque dees
not have a propensity for violence. It is loyal to ELIJAH
MUHAMMAD and follows bis teachings without reservation.
The minister, JAMES LONDON, frequently derides “black power"
and teaches that they use violence only in answer to
violence upon them.

The only “militant black nationalist" included upon
the Rabble-Rouser Index is TOMMY WRENN. WRENN was an .
independent candidate for City Council, whose campaign
did not invoke any use of violence. WRENN is a subsistence

The active black nationalist movement in

LONDON, reportecly has abandoned his family and is
believed to be in Atlanta, Georgia.

When in possession of adequate information
vegarding the background of WALLACE or present activities
of LONDON, Birmingham believes it may then be in a
position to attempt a counterintelligence operation
designed to split the membership over the question of
leadership and operation of the Mosque.

from Chicago, Illinois. The previous minister, JAMES
LONDON, reportedly has abandened his family and is
believed to be in Atlanta, Georgia.

When in possession of adequate information
vegarding the background of WALLACE or present activities
of LONDON, Birmingham believes it may then be in a
position to attempt a counterintelligence operation
designed to split the membership over the question of
leadership and operation of the Mosque,

He adyised that the followig proposal was sent to
the Director:

The racial conference at the SOG discussed the
Washington Spring Project headed by MARTIN LUTHER KING and
recommended that the facts about the Project be brought to
the attention of possible participants through a rumor campaign.
We would use our informants, without their knowledge, to spread
the story about lack of fumids and organization. Fears of
economic reprisal and personal safety should dissuade potential
participants. We would point out also that the Project is
strictly for MARTIN LUTHER KING's benefit which is actually
the case. He thinks he can regain lost prestige by this
demonstration. Some suggested rumors would consist of: : /

The participants would be told that their names
would be taken in Washington and welfare checks from the
Government discontinued.

Possible threats of violence and bodily harm to the
participants would be spread. Also information showing that__
“the Washington Negro Commmity is incensed and furious with S
Pegpeck to this march on Washington by outside Negroes.

Se The above are a few of the type of rumors that ean be
used and you should tie in any rumor of this nature to your local .

problem, _Alse think of othe: intelligence methods and
secure telephonic approval from the Bureau prior to utilization.

MARTIN LUTHER KING

A. KING has changed the date of his

Washington Spring Project (WSP) on several occasions;
he has, on occasion, announced his anticipated presence
at various locations, and then send a top aide instead
of appearing himself; he has periodically changed the
dates of his appearances in certain geographic areas,
Many times, announcements were made when KING was to be_
at a specific WSP meeting in order to draw a crowd, when
actually it was known in advance by KING that he, would

It is. felt the above considerations can
be exploited to cause confusion in the efforts of KING
and his group, and to cause Negro dissatisfaction with
his operating procedures, This could be accomplished
by the following: :

1) When KING is actually to :
be at a gathering, have informants circulate false in-
formation as to time, date and location of KING's ap-
pearance, or variations of each, i.e., correct time and
place, but different location, correct location, but
different date, et cetera,

2) Have informants circulate
information that KING is to be at announced local meet~
ings of SCLC groups when, in fact, he will not be present,

3) ‘ Announce, through informant,
when KING is to’be at specific place, that this is only a
guise to draw a crowd, and only local leaders will be
present, excluding KING.

B. KING and his top aides dress expen-
sively, generally travel via first class means, and
stay at first class accommodations usually in predomi-~ .
nately white areas of cities he visits. Recently, in
Memphis, KING ran from’his followers when violence erupted
‘during a march he was leading there, It is felt the above
two considerations could be linked: to' discredit KING and
his aides with poor Negroes who he is seeking support from.
This could be accomplished by the preparation of a flyer
showing photographs of KING and aides dressed well, next
to photographs of Negroes poorly clothed; under the photo-
graph would be data concerning his expensive tates, ac-
commodations, use of private airplane, and related data;
with this information would be information concerning

NW 54987 Docld:32989734 Page 81 2



NW 54987 DocId:

JN 100-980

KING's deserting his followers during the Memphis riots.
The key note message would be that KING and his aides
are out for their own financial-and physical welfare
primarily. Flyers could be prepared from newspaper
photographs of KING and tis aides, or from some photo-
gvaphs available at various field offices. Distribution
could be by anonymous mailings to poor Negro leaders,

or by placement of copies at Negro meeting places by
informants.

TL. STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING
COMMITTEE (SNCC)

This group has discouraged its members
from associating with whites. Information has been de-
veloped that some leaders and top functionaries, since
the establishment of this policy, have periodically
maintained close associations,to include residing with
white girl friends. Information concerning these asso~
ciations could be capitalized on by counterintelligence
measures to show the hypocrisy of these leaders and to
discredit the individuals involved with their new "Black
only" oriented associates in the same organization, and
to discredit them with leaders of other Black Nationalist
organizations withvhom they may be seeking support or
vapport, — :

Specifically, efforts could be undertaken
to obtain photographs of the principals involved with
their white girl friends. The flyer could then be pre-
pared containing this photograph or photographs. Under
the photograph could be information regarding the princi-
pals' position with SNCC, followed by quotations of top
SNCC leaders regarding associations with whites or
Black Separatists statements, The flyers could be mailed
anonymously to pertinent.National and local leaders of
SNCC and/or to leaders of other Black Nationalist organiza-
tions advocating Black separatism, rather than simply

‘ sent under the guise of Nation of Islam, Revolutionary

construed to be criticizing as a group the individuals’

By letter forwarded to the Bureau by Jackson
on May 11, 1968, the Jackson Division requested approval
for a counterintelligence measure against the three main

tionaries in Mississippi - meres cae FL fc, at

, ‘ ting separate anonymous eseieaaeanle

activities and members, which information is true, but

in fact provided by other Jackson sources, and not

traceable to Jackson sources. Letters would be signed
"Charlie", The letters to each addressee would be :
"shuffled" so that letter to FLETCHER would be "erroneously"
placed in envelope addressed to SPENCER; letter to SPENCER
"erroneously" placed in envelope to WILSON, etc.

IL, OPERATIONS BEING EFFECTED

Bureau approval has not yet been received re-
garding operation being considered which is mentioned above.

The Jackson Division has effected some opera-~ ;
tions through rumor campaign initiated regarding the Souther
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Poor People's Campaig
The following measures were implemented:

_ A. On April 24, 1968, JY 380-R (PROB - 7
GHETTO) returned from Washington, D.C., where she was ar-
rested with 35 others on April 22, 1968, while conducting
Silent vigil around National Capitol building. Source was
fined $700, given suspended jail sentence, and placed on
one year's Fedexal Probation for her participation in vigil;
source advised others arrested received similar serious
penalties for involvement. Source, on return to Mississippi,
was encouraged by handling Agents to publicize her arrest and
punishment to prospective Poor People's Campaign participants
7 as indication of severe manner in which they would be dealt

: with by Washington officials if they went there with the
Poor People's Campaign. Source is a state leader in a pre-
dominately Negro Welfare Rights Group and is well regarded
by Negro poverty elements in Mississippi; source was subse-
quently veryvocal in making known her arrest and punishment
in Washington, D.C.,to Mississippi prospective Poor People's
Campaign participants.

B. JN 386 - R (PROB) was, and still is, the
Jackson Organizer for the Poor People's Southeyn Caravan.

NW 54987 Docld:32989734 Page 85 2
a |


javeaan IN 100-980 -

He was encouraged by contacting Agents to emphasize
non-violent objective of Poor People's Campaign and
to be alert for any militant Negro infiltrators of
Southern Caravan who had propensity for violence. He
was instructed to likewise advise and alert his lieu-
tenants in this regard and to make it known around
the Jackson area that no militants would be acceptable
as Poor People's Campaign participants.

TILT. TANGIBLE RESULTS

Regarding A. above, in no small measure
due to JN 380 ~ R (PROB ~ GHETTO's) "arrest publicity"
efforts, participation by older, mature, poverty-stricken G
Mississippi Negroes in the Southern Caravan of the Poor
People! s Campaign was minimal. The majority of the Miss-
issippi participants were youthful people, Negro males
and females.

Regarding B. above, JN 386 - R (PROB)
was personally instrumental in screening out many mili-
tant Negro youths from participating in any manner in .
the Southern Caravan portion of the Poor People's Campaign.
He was especially watchful for anyone in any manner asso-
elated with SNCC and any allegations he received in this
vegard wexe grounds for automatic elimination of individual:
as Southern Caravan participant.

IV. DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTER INTELLIGENCE
INTEREST

The Jackson Division has disseminated per-

i tinent information regarding known Mississippi Black
Natiodlist militants to all appropriate local and State
law enforcement officials. They, in turn, carefully
scrutinize activities of these individuals for any indi-
cations that they may be breaking State or local laws.
Any violations result in rapid arrest. In this regard,
ROBERT EARL FLETCHER, JR., and DONALD WILSON JACKSON, Negro
Black Nationalist Militants from Jackson, Missisdippi, have
each been arrested once by local authorities on minor in-
fractions over the past four months.

out-of-state Black Nationalists traveling to Mississippi,
is immediately furnished local and State authorities;
these authorities likewise scrutinize activities of these
out-of-staters while in Mississippi, for any indications
of law-breaking. Recently, two SNCC members from Tennessee,
following FBI alert to local authorities, were stopped on.
traffic violation; their automobile was searched and con-
-cealed weapons and drugs were found, resulting in more
serious charges; charges are still pending and individuals
involved were released on bond and immediately returmed to

Re Charlotte letters to Director dated 7/9/68,
and 7/31/68.

1. Qperations Under Consideration

In connection with HOWARD LAMAR FULLER (Agitator

Index Subject), records of FULLER'’s telephone toll calls
were received from the Durham, N. C., Police Department md
investigation is presently being conducted to identify all
subscribers both within North Carolina and out of state to
develop his contacts. On analyzing the results of this
. investigation, the recommendations will be made based on

available information as to what actions may be taken to
undermine FULLER's effectiveness as an organizer.

Recent information received from CB 2319-R (PROB)
to the effect that GOLDEN ASRO FRINKS, Field Secretary,
scie for North Carolina, is losing favor with the national
leadership of SCLC. According to this source, a state-wide
convention will be held later this year at which time efforts
will be made to replace FRINKS, who is currently conducting
daily demonstrations in Hyde County, N.C., in protest of
a school desegregation plan accepted by Department of Health,
Education and Welfare. Separate letters wjil be submitted

concerning this matter on development_of, rther information.

2. Qperations Being Effected

None.

3. Tangible Results ial

It should be noted that according to information
received, HOWARD LAMAR FULLER's foundation for commnity
development, Durham, N. C., will expend its funds as of
10/1/68. His activities after that date should be curtailed
due to lack of money for his travel expenses. This matter
is being followed closely to determine the source of many
new funds.

4. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

‘With the start of the 1968-1969 school year and
the re-opening of colleges, racial activity within the
Charlotte Division should increase. It should be pointed
out that there are numerous predominantly Negro institutions
throughout the state, most of which have some type Afro-
American organization on the college campus.

Charlotte has alerted its sources for any militant
activity in this regard, and the Bureau will be kept advised.

: CE 2319-R (PROB) is in a position to assist in any
counterintelligence program mounted against GOLDEN ASRO FRINKS
and to furnish detailed information concerning FRINKS. It
is anticipated that if sufficient information is developed
through this informant and in view of the voluminous
background data in the Charlotte files regarding FRINKS, a
proposal for counterintelligence activity will be made.

‘Charlotte was recently quite successful in a
counterintelligence program concerning Klan and militant
white groups wherein with Bureau permission data of a
public source nature was furnished to a trusted newspaper
reporter, who wrote a series of articles. it is anticipated
that all development of the proper information, the same
type operation can be proposed against FRINKS.

Re Charlotte letter to the Bureau dated 9/24/68,

and to approve, if deemed advisable, the following counter- _ :
intelligence action to be undertaken in the Charlotte Division:

IN RE JAMES RUFUS BARROW:

Charlotte File 157-5813
Bureau File 157-7782

This individual is on the Agitator Index of the
Charlotte Division and resides at 406 Van Norton Street,
Washington, N. C,

Subject in April of this year organized a group
of approximately 300 Negroes to disrupt the school activities
at P. S. Jones High School, a Negro high school in Washington,
N.C. He has continued some degree of agitation in Negro
high schools throughout the area and has claimed to be associated
with the NAACP and the SCLC,

This individual is well known to local authorities
&@8 an alcoholic, and information has been received indicating
that he may transport and use personally non-tax paid whisky.

Investigation has also reflected that this subject
has lost his driver's license on two occasions, once while
driving intoxicated and once for driving while his driverts
license was under revocation.

CE 157-6109 ;

Through informants and local police department

activities, Charlotte feels that an occasion my arise in

i the future to know the occasion when BARROW will have
non-tax paid whisky in his automobile or otherwise in his
possession, and Charlotte feels that such information
properly handled sould result in this individual being
renoved as a source of agitation in the Eastern North
Carolina area.

A conviction for possession of non-tax paid
whisky or driving while intoxicated, second offense, should
result in the immediate loss of his driver's license for
probably a year, which would tend to curtail this individual's
travel ability, and possession of non-tax paid whisky could
result in an active jail sentence, which would remove him
completely from the scene of operation.

REQUEST OF THE BUREAU:

The Bureau is requested to consider and approve,
4f deemed advisable, the furnishing to the appropriate local
and State authorities information concerning this individual
having in his possession non-tax paid whisky, or while driving
under the influence, which it is anticipated would fesult in
his arrest and possibly receiving an active jail sentence.

IN RE GOLDEN ASRO FRINKS;

Charlotte File 157-5267
Bureau File 157-7975

This individual is on the Agitator Index of the
Charlotte Division and this individual 1s Field Secretary
and Director of the SCLC and operates primarily in the Hyde
County area of North Carolina at the present time. As the
Bureau is aware, this individual has been a source of
considerable agitation and interference in Hyde County of
the operation of the public school system. He is currently
leading a boycott of Negro students of Hyde County schools,
and this matter has been presented in detail to the Bureau in
Charlotte file 173-622, captioned "Desegregation of Hyde County,

CE 157-6109

Through CE 2319-R (PROB), Charlotte has learned
that FRINKS is allegedly carrying on an illicit affair with
a Negro teenager, a cheerleader, at the 0. A. Peay High
School, The girl allegedly involved with FRINKS is thirteen
years old, and it is felt that this information can be
utilized very effectively and possibly result in criminal
charges being brought against FRINKS, It is contemplated
that such information relating to FRINKS, as his contributing
to the delinquency of & minor, as well as possible adultery
charges, would severely discredit him and might possibly
result in his less of position with SCLC,

In addition to the above, FRINKS is known to
drive at excessive rates of speed in his travels from one
location to another, and it is felt that through proper
liaison with the N. C, Highway Patrol, FRINKS can more
elosely be observed in his travels, which will result in
Wiis arrest for traffic violations relating to speed.

According to information from CE 2319-R (PROB),
— has had some criticism from SCLC leaders concerning
his school boycott operations in Hyde County, N. C.

It 4s felt that the successful handling of either
the first or second operations listed above could likely
result in charges or possible conviction and an active
jail sentence, which would remove FRINKS from the area as
an agitator, and at the same time, further discredit hin
personally and the SCIC generally in the Hyde County, N. C.,
area. This could lead to his further difficulty with rational
leaders of the SCLO.

WEST OF THE BUREAU s
The Bureau is requested to consider and approve,
if deemed advisable, the furnishing of information to the
proper authorities concerning FRINKS' alleged illicit affair
with @ thirteen~year-old high school girl, and the close

observation of his driving habits by N. C. Highway Patrol,

’ both of which operations are calculated to remove FRINKS
from the scene of his disruption tactics, and to discredit

and Director of SCLC,

Charlotte will take no action concerning the above
eounterintelligence operations pending Bureau approval,

‘at this meeting to the effect that black people in the

a black man-can kill five whites, then he can die knowing —
that he tried-to overthrow the white system.

CHARLES. WRIGHT, possibly a student from A & M

that he would be willing to personally lead a black army
through the residential streets of white America.

ssoc organized demonstrations against Dow Chemical

SS0C is closely associated with SDS and may be one

support ‘to carry out its objeetive, it could present a
definite potential for violence.

Student Non-Violent Seordinating Committee (SNCC)

: Gainesville, Florida

IRVEN LEE-DAWKINS, since the Spring of 1987, has
claimed to be the Chairman of SNCC in Gainesville and has
claimed that he was recognized as such by the national
headquarters of SNCC’ in’ Atlanta, Georgia. He writes a
leaflet, "The Black Voices” which is periodically distributed
in Gainesville. DAWKINS and CAROL THOMAS , white female,
who is a long time Civil Rights worker in Gainesville, were
sentenced on 2 3.2/27/87 for contempt of court ‘in Gainesville,
Florida, and were denied appeal bond.

JK 157-1523

On 2/8/68, they were released on bond by order of the.
Fifth Cireuit Court of Appeals, New Orleans, Louisiana.
While DAWKINS and THOMAS were in jail, a minber of fires
were startdd by incendiary devices in white businesses in

‘Negro areas of Gainesville as well as the home of Judge

a. C. ADKINS, oR. in whose Recutats they were sentenced.

‘since ‘their release from jail, at least eleven
fires have been started in Gainesville, Florida, by
incendiary devices.

. On 8/15/68, IRVEN LEE DAWKINS and four other
individuals were arrested by the Gainesville, Florida
Police Department, on an arson charge. On 3/18/68 another

: “Negro male was arrested on the same charge. They are

currently being held in the Alachua County Jail, Gainesville,
Florida. Bond in the amount.of $10,000 was set for DAWKINS
and $7500 bond was set for the other individuals.

‘ SNCC,3which is. composed of DAWKINS and a group of
followers , are believed to have been responsible for the
burnings in Gainesville, Florida.

While the burnings have ceased, since the arrest
ef DAWKINS and the five individuals there is always the
potential for additional incidents by sympathizers of
other followers of DAWKINS who were not arrested.

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

Re Bureau airtel to Albany, 3/4/68.
San Yiago airtel, 4/3/68. ,

The US Group under the leadership of JOSEPH VINSON continues
to be the primary target of the Countesrintelligence Program in the
San Diego Office.

1. Operations under considerations

The San Biego Office plans to conduct interviews of all of
the members of the US Group. In these interviews, questions will
be asked in such a manner as to weaken the influence of leaders
of this group. The growing internal dissension in the group
wlll be encouraged. Bureau authority will be reguested in each
case before interview unless an opportunity for interview should
present itself in any particular case.

Through contact with the San Yiego Police Department, this
office is encouraging their making it difficult for the group to
hold meetings. Various groups who have control of public
meeting places will be contacted in an effort to discourage
cooperation with the US Group.

Informants will be used to plant seeds of dissension

whenever possible, ..

NW 54987 Docld:32989734 Page 131

Since the US Group is composed of individuals who use
drugs of various kinds and become involved in robberies and
arson, the San “iego Police Lepartment has arrested 9 number
of the members of the group. Close liaison contact is maintained
with the police department and whenever the opportunity presents
itself, they are encouraged to continue to enforce the law where
this group is concerned. On numerous occasions police officers
have indicated that they are discouraged because known Black
Nationalists have been released by the courts, sometimes without
bail. These officers are praised for their part in enforcing the
law and ara encouraged to continue to do their duty in this
respect. The San Diego Office intends to recommend that letters
from the Director of the FBI be written to deserving officers
who have done outstanding work in law enforcement in the racial
field.

The San Diego Office intends to encourage news coverage of
antieviolent statements by Negroes who are prominent in San
Diego, such ag ARCHIE MOORE, former heavy wéight champion of the
world, Sources in the news field will also be encouraged to
publicize job opportunities and outstanding accomplishments by
Negroes in San Diego. .

The San Diego Offics will be alert to counterintelligence
aetion which can be taken against individuals and will request
Bureau authority before taking such action, UACB the operations
described above wili be conducted.

2. Operations being effected:

JOSEPH VINSON, head of the US Group in San Diego has been
interviewed by agents of the FBI. He was not cooperative and
is complgtely Black Nationalistic in his thinking. Officers of
the San Diego Police Department have advised that a grand jury
indictment is being raturned against members of the US Group who .
have been involved in arson attempts aainst schools in San “iego.
They intend to get a grand jury indictment against JOSBPH VINSON
for conspiracy on the same charge, VINSON recently completed a
personnel questionairre at his place of employment. The San Diego
office made available to the Security Departmont of Gulf General
Atomic, where ‘he is employed, public source material which reflected
that VINSON was not only a member of organizations which he did
not List, but was in fact an officer in the organizations.

Five members of the US Group were recently arrested by the

San Diego County Sheriff's Office on a traffic charge. At the
time they had in thér possession a quantity of arms and ammunition.

Qe



They also had in their possession a number of names of prominent
businesa men 'n San “lego. A number of these business men who
are personally known to agents working in the racial field have
been contacted te determine whether US Group members have
contacted them in an effort to obtain financing or contributions.
These individuals have not been contacted to date and there is no
indication why the names of thease individuals were in the possession
of those arrested, These individuals have been advised of the
nature of the US Group on a confidential basis and will advise
the F3I should they be contacted te furnish financial assistance
to this group.

Through liaison with the police department and the San Diego
County Sheriff's Office, it has been possible to make it more
difficult for this group to find a public meeting place, Toen
Post Number 1 and a house owned by a woman's club at 2972 Clay
Street are now not avaiable as meeting places fcr this group,
They have had to meet at homes of verious members and this has
eut the attendance at meetings to the hard core members of the
groupe This is making it more difficult for this group to
spread their brand of hatred of the white to the Negro community.

The San Diego Office is making an effort to obtain the
license number, make, model and color of cars determined to
be available to US Group members, It is believed that should
trouble in the Negro area occur, it would be possible to spot
and follow activities of this group through information concerning
cars available to them.

3. Tangible results:

The US Group is having increasing difficulty in finding
pleces to hold their meetings where they can attact a crowd
of Negroes.

Informants report that the US Group is having a problem
with dissension among it's members. Some of the members are
becoming Assatisfied with the leadership because they want to
do all the talking and individual members have Little or nothing
to say. The leadership has advised members of the group to
rob stores to. get guns and has told them to take what they want
from the white man, As a result Of following this policy, several
members of the US Group have been arrested. Members of the froup
are becoming increasingly suspicious of the intentions of RON
KARENGA, the Leader of the US, Ine. Group in Los Angeles.

KARENGA often spsaks in San Diego before members of tais group.

4k. Davelopments of counterintelligence interest:

Agents working with the racial situation in San Diego sre of
the opinion that thare has bean a dacreasa of militancy on the
part of loaders of US, Inc. in Los Angeles and of the US Group
in San “iego since the murder of Dr. NARTIN LUINER KING, KARCNGA
failed to appear as a apeaker at the San Diego Black Yonference.
This was not in Line with his usual activity in San Diego. The
leadership of the US Group in San “lero, while still militent,
have not been as outspoken in thelr hatred of the white and there
have not been reports of the "honkie blood will run in the street,"
type of speech since that time. It appears that the murder of
De. MARTIN LUTHER KING could have caused the leadership to become
mora cautious in their statements before groups of Negroes.

San Diego will be alert to further indication that the death
of KING had an effect on the militants of San Diego and will keep
the Bureau advised.

Leaders of "TACT" have indicated that the principal reason
for scheduling Brown as a speaker was to have her precede the
appearance of Martin Luther King in the southside Virginia arza.
King is scheduled to tour Virginia on March 30, 1968. Charles W.
Cover has indicated that Brown's speaking engagement should have
the effect of diminishing King's recruiting efforts for the WSP
and possibly keep King from coming to the southside Virginia area
entirely. :

On March 19, 1968, Captain J: E. Towler, Danville Police
Iepartment, Danville, Virginia, advised that Mrs. dulia Brown, above,
will speak at the Danville City Armory (auditorium) on March 27,
1968. Captain Towler stated her appearance in Danville is being
Sponsored by the Committee described as ‘an ad hoc committee",
and that the identities of persons serving on this committee are
not known. According to Captain Towler, Mrs. Brown is to be
advertised in advanced publicity as a former undercover agent of
the FBI. She will speak on the Communist connections of Dr. Martin
Iuther King. Captain Towler stated it appears that Mrs. Brown's
appearance in Danville is aimed at being disruptive of the
efforts of Dr. King in this area and of southsidé Virginia during.
-his visit on Mareh 30, 1968. :

Captain Towler stated that to date this "ad hoc
committee" has declined to reveal its name or membership.

2. CORE

Miami has a small, relatively inactive CORE:
“chapter which does not follow the militant policies of
of the national organization. The Miami leaders of this
group have been described as “conservative"~and under their
current leadership, CORE in Miami does not appear to have
‘ any propensity for violence. = .

3. SCLC

: SCLC in Miami is also a relatively small group,
with attendance at their weekly meetings ranging from
six to twenty persons. Their main interest and activities
appear to center around Miami's EOP program and they have
apparently little national direction. The President of
‘SCLC in Miami was arrested by local authorities on
March 22, 1968, for grand larceny in connection with
anti-poverty funds SCLC in Miami has received.

. The Miami Office is currently conducting an
investigation captioned "JIMMIE LEE CHATHMON, PRESIDENT,
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE, MIAMI, FLORIDA;
ATHOS L, LA SALLE, CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT , * FRAUD
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT" Qliami file 46-3743). Basis for

. this investigation is an allegation that, SCLC in Miami
submitted false documents to EOP, a federally-funded -
program, concerning the accounting system utilized by
SCLC, y

B. Individuals
1, ALFRED DWIGHT AMOS FEATHERSTON

: FEATHERSTON is an SI subject of the Miami Office

and has resided within this territory for approximately a
year. Prior to his arrival in Miami, he reportedly attended
NOI:meetings, professed admiration for MALCOLM X, claimed
contact with FIDEL CASTRO, and expressed a. knowledge of

- and a desire to obtain plastic explosives. He was
arrested in July, 1959, in Guatemala in connection
with a plot to assassinate the president of that
country. In 1964, he claimed he was going, to assassinate
two southern governors and said it would be a good idea
to assist the CP in eliminating President JOHNSON.



‘iu 157-2414

“~. Since his arrival in Miami, FEATHERSTON is
not known to have associated with any Biack Nationalists

. or other racial groups. He is not known to have expounded

Black Nationalist feelings and therefore, at the present
time, is not considered as potentially dangerous in con-
nection with this program. : :

“2. JOHN STROMAN

[JOHN STROMAN of West Palm Beach, Florida, was
involved in the racial disturbances at Pompano, Florida,
during the summer of 1967. Information has recently been
received that STROMAN has joined the Merchant Marine and
has left the South Florida area. Investigation is being
conducted to verify his departure from this area.

3. CHARLES HENRY WRIGHT

WRIGHT, a@ native of Georgia, has resided within
the Miami Division for approximately four years. He
attended Miami-Dade Junior College and Florida Atlantic
University, Boca Raton, Florida. He apparently dropped
out of Florida Atlantic University within the past few
months and indications are now that he has left the
South Florida area. Investigation is being conducted
to lata his current whereabouts.

WRIGHT has predicted a total racial war ig the

'. demands of the black people were not met. He has

described the United States as the "cradle of races
in the world" and is a backer of the "black power"
philosophy. He has said the United States is doomed;
racial war is imminent unless black _ Power demands are
fully met.

WRIGHT was unsuccessful in an attempt to form

an sycc chapter at Miami-Dade Junior College and Eid ethaehee

Sm a current member of SSOC.

: The teachings and philosophies expounded by
the NOI are such that they should aiways be considered
as having a propensity for violence and therefore, thet
Miami Division is considering counterinteliigence
activities which might be taken against that. organi~
zation within the Miami territory.

2. SCLC

Inasmuch as the SCLC isa loosely disciplined
outrit whose membership is open to any Negro in the area,
with very little discipline or self-sacrifice required,
this organization appears to be the only organization
within the Miami territory which could constitute a
rallying point for Black Nationalists who do not desire
or are unable to acéept the discipline of the NOI, This,

ethér with the assumption that SCLC will be the focai
point for people from the Miami area desirous of par-
ticipating in MARTIN LUTHER KING's march on Washington,
~would mark them as potentially dangerous. - The current
criminal investigations being conducted on the leader-
ship of this group would make them apparent easy i fe
for counterinteliligence activities.

B. Individuals

No individuals are being considered for action
under this program at the present time.

IV.. Suggestions

Miami suggests that former members of Black
Nationalist groups, particularly the NOI, not be over—
‘looked in this intelligence program, Former NOI members
who have been exposed to the hate teachings of that
organization but are no longer subjected to its
discipline should often be considered as eee
dangerous with regard to racial matters,

Vv. Miami is submitting a separate letter with
‘suggestions for Screech actions tobe taken
against the NOI and SCLC,

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM
BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS.
RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

oy : Miami's SCLC Chapter raised approximately $3,000
to send local participants to the Poor Peoples Campaign
‘in Washington, D. C. They decided to charter a bus for
their trip to Washington, and when it appeared they would
not have sufficient people to fill a chartered bus,
Greyhound officials recommended they travel on regularly
. scheduled bus. These people, however, insisted on
-ehartering a bus with a capacity for 38 persons at a
cost of almost $1400 for the round trip. .

A total of 14 or 15 people traveled to Washington -

in this bus departing Miami 5/15/68. Some of these

. people remained in Washington or went on to New York City
on vacation after participating in the program and only
nine returned to Miami from Washington on the bus,
arriving Miami 6/24/68, ane : Gieveeeeiceeriart

This chartered bus was an obvious waste of

money. Had these people traveled to Washington via

_ regularly scheduled bus service, round trip fare for
nine persons would have been $50.85 each and one-way fare
for six persons would have been $33.35 each for a total
cost of $675.75. These people, therefore, wasted over

$800 by travel on chartered bus. If these participants

had flown regularly scheduled Eastern Air Lines flights
' to Washington, their total cost would have been Giana

$1244.25. ei :

“It is noted that the money raised in Miami was

’ raised specifically in the name of the Poor Peoples Campaign,
and it appears there must be considerable money not used 7
or Beccee for this program. a” fees

Miami's SCLC Chapter already has a poor reputa-

“tion in connection with handling funds, particularly in

view of the fact the former President of Miami SCLC's
Chapter is currently under indictment for Grand Larceny in -
_. connection with EOPI funds handled through SCLC. This

: fact, together with the money wasted on the Poor Peoples

. Campaign, presents an excellent opportunity for action
under captioned program. Es

Most of this information has been discussed
openly at SCLC meetings. Bureau authority is requested to
‘ furnish this information to CLARENCE JONES, a staff writer
for the "Miami Herald." Miami Office has had an excellent
relationship with JONES and information has been furnished
him confidentially in the past without his revealing the
“Bureau as a source of this information. :

If Bureau authority is granted to furnish this
information to JONES, he will be impressed with the
necessity of not revealing the Bureau's identity as
a source of this information, Miami Office feels this
action will in no way result in embarrassment to the Bureau.

County, Florida, school system, and an assistant minister i
and frequent speaker at Mosque Number 23, had been convicted
in Knoxville, Tennessee, for molesting vomen. On March 7,

Re Miand letter to the Bureau, 8/28/68.

The black nationalist movement within the Miami
Division has changed somewhat since submission of referenced
letter. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
whose charter was revoked almost a year ago had been operating
officially under the name of "Poor Peoples Campaign Support
Group" although they had been accepted in the Miami area as
an SCLC chapter. They have become almost completely inactive
Since the Republican National Convention at Miami Beach in
August, 1968. They do not hold regular meetings and have

from this post in November, 1968, and a permanent successor
has not yet been selected. He claimed his resignation was
based on academic reasons. i :

Since referenced letter, JIMMIE LEE CHATMON,
mentioned above, and THOMAS NICADOMAS SCOTT have been added
to Miami's agitator index. SCOTT is not connected with any
organization and reportedly only has a snail following of
young Negro hoodiuns..

I. Operations Under Consideration

Miami is considering resubmitting a request to
the Bureau to capitalize on recent allegations that the
minister of Mosque 29 of the NOI in Miami has been having
an affair with a female member of that nosque. Such ailega~
tions have been circulating as rumors among members of
Mosque 29 and the Miami Office hopes to capitalize on this
through the submission of an anonymous letter to NOT Head-
quarters in Chicago alleging the minister is having such an

’ affair.

“an. “Operations Being Effected

: The counterintelligence program is being considered
in connection with Miami's interview program of members of
the NOI. Approximately 15 NOI members and leaders have been
interviewed since submission of referenced letter and it is
anticipated that 9 or 10 members will be interviewed or
_re-interviewed in the near future.

Til. Tangible Results

It has been reported by NOI imformants that the
minister of Mosque 29 appears quite upset by FBI interviews
of him and other members. He seems to fear the effect such
interviews will have on members and at meetings has threatened
members with drastic action if they coogerate with the FBI
when interviewed. Members are told never to cooperate with

the FBI unless they agree to make an appointment for an
-taterview at which time, he, the minister, should be
present. He told members to ask contacting agents if
they have a warrant and if they do not have a warrant
the FBI has no right to talk to them. The minister's
frequent referral to the FBI interviews have resulted in
wenbers ridiculing him behind his back because he becomes
‘sovupset at these interviews. The minister, thus, is
Yoosing the confidence somewhat of his members and adé@i-
tional interviews with this point in mind should have an
even greater effect on the membership's attitude towards

, Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); ELIJAR
MUBANMAD and other Negro leaders jcining hands, supposedly
at the residence of ELIJAH MUHAMMAD,

PX 697-R further stated that CUSHMEER then stated
“this is proof that even the great leader of the SCLC is
accepting the Honorable ELIJAH MUHAMMAD's leadership." The
Rev. RALPH ABERNATHY knows he has been teaching the white
man’s bogus religion too long to the black people. PX 697-R
stated that these statements made a great impression on the
HPI 32 congregation.

The above is set out for the information of the
Bureau and Chicago as CO regarding the NOE in order to evalu-
ate whether or not such impact as mentioned above is prevaient
on the national level at other NOI mosques and, if so, to
weigh the possibility of either (1) advising Rev. ABERNATHY
that a militant black Negro organization is of the opinion
that the SCLC is in sympathy with the NOI separation philo~
sophy and requesting a publicized rebuttal by ABERNATHY; or
(2) assuming that ABERNATHY is not cooperative, Bureau and
090 are requested to veigh the potential of a friendly news
media interviewing ABERNATHY, confronting him with the above
picture and asking ABERNATHY if in fact the SCLC is in sym-
pathy with the NOI philosophy.

FBIHQ also indicated that Bureau files had been

to insure completeness and thoroughness each recipient
office was to furnish FBIHQ two xerox copies of any
communication meeting the above mentioned criteria.

Atlanta has reviewed its Cointelpro, Black

and 2 xerox copies of the following Atlanta communications
are being furnished to FBIHQ:

(1) Atlanta airtel to FBIHQ, 3/18/68, captioned,

serial 100-7182-4).

(2) Atlanta airtel to FBIHQ, 4/30/68, captioned,
"COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM, BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS,
RACIAL INTELLIGENCE". (This communication set forth the name
of the agent designated by the Atlanta Office as coordinating
agent for the program but there was nothing in this airtel
pertaining to MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., or the SCLC). (Atlanta
serial 100~7182~9).

This Atlanta control file contained no other
communications prepared by Atlanta dealing with any Cointelpro
activities directed against MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., or the

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

ReBuairtel to Albany and other offices, 3/4/68.

(L) SA EDWARD U. CRIM has been designated by the
Atlanta Office as coordinating agent for this program.

(2) The Atlanta Division has two main black national
ist movements. They are: SNCC, with approximately 15 active
members and possibly 25-35 partially active members; and NOI,,
which maintains a Mosque in Atlanta having nembershap of about
75 to 125, with as many as 160 to 190 people appearing for some
of the open meetings.

It is estimated that Atlanta SNCC office has very

great potential, and that NOI has very little potential, for

i violence, based on information available to Atlanta at this
+ time.

The following subjects of the ‘Agitator Index are
considered militant black nationalists and might, in the
future, be considered targets for counterintelligence action
because of their propensity for violence:

(3) SNCC is considered of such potential danger
‘ as to warrant consideration fer current counterintelligence
action. This is based on information received concerning
SNCC's purposes, which have been flatly stated as "to cheate
chaos within the Unitéd States so that the white population.
can be brought to its knees."

“WEG 157-1291

i. Cperations Under Consideration: ;

WIG recently submitted a proposal ta the Burean
regarding a “word of mouth" counterintelligence measure smong
selected sources te be directed against STOKELY CARMICE..2L in
an attempt to create the impression within the ghetto ccomunity
that. he is in fact a paid agent of the Government.

In addition, it could be inferred that Gevernment agents
Ee are maintaining close tabs on CARMICHAEL's whereabouts at all
times in order to afford him protection, not just in WDC, but
throughout the U.S.

The above is believed to be one of perhaps a few
counterintelligence measures that could be effective against
CARMICHAEL. Any allegation of immorality or illegal activity
would only enhance his reputation within the ghette.

CARMICHAEL has not gone through with the purchase of
the $70,000 house, but it should not be overlooked that he is
already living in a house valued near $50,000, which a source
has reported is. to be completely refurnished and has already

. been carpeted throughout. WFO will recommend dissemination to
appropriate news media in this respect in the near future.

WFO will continue to remain alert to situations wherein
a counterintelligence measure would be timely against the various
hate groups and individuals involved therewith.

It should be berne in mind; hewever, that any counter-
intelligence measure against any of these groups or individuals
requires a different approach than the usual counterintelligence
program. As pointed cut above, regarding CARMICHAEL, any
immoral or illegal act improves their image within the ghetto
community.

Im addition, the very. nature of some of the individuals
which comprise these groups lends.to a certain™ disunity. Jit ~~
itself as. illustrated within Resurrection City. Perhaps more.

: thought. should be- given to breeding discontent within the various
! groups, which if successful, would render a leader "groupless.". 7

“WEO 157 -1292

IL. Operations Being Effected:

As pointed out above, WFO has submitted a proposal
to the Bureau regarding CARMICHAEL and will implement same upon
authorization by the Bureau.

iil. Tangible Results:

WFO was in the process of submitting a recommendation
regarding the purchase of a $70,000 house by CARMICHAEL, proposing
release of this information te appropriate news media for
publication upon consumation of the purchase, when news articles
regarding this purchase appeared. As the Bureau is aware,
CARMICHAEL end MIRIAM MAKEBA thereafter cancelled the contract
to buy this property, claiming inability to obtain suitable
financing. As the Bureau pointed out, it has had an effect

--on his reputation among some black militants.

IV. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest:

It ig noted that WEO has continuously considered what.
would be effective counterintelligence measures against various
hate groups. and: certain individuals such as CARMICHAEL. The

‘ April, 1968, riots in WDC and the presence of the "Poor Peoples

: Campaign" has certainly influenced the course of action by some
of these groups and has in. fact been responsible for the creation
of others.. The "Black United Front't (BUF), which CARMICHAEL
formed, has been more noticeably active. as of late and recently,
for example, took a definite stand on the shooting of two white
policemen by a Negro. robbery: suspect and his accomplice in the
shooting, stating black men have a right to defend themselves
against the "honky" policemen:

The news media has been dominated by the above since the
assassination of Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., and perhaps calls
for a different approach to an effective counteringelligence pro-
gram. than prior to the riots. It is further felt that a more ef
effective use of news media could be made in. the future in that
an article may receive more attention chamg during the past few
months.

WEO will remain alert to situations which can be
capitilized: on under the counterintelligence program and will -eise
advise Bureau under individual case captions along with
| appropriate recommendations.

i Of the organizations named above, SNCC is assessed

of hatred for the white race. These same officials, however,

of this type could easily be blamed om the followers of ELIIAG

HOBSON is the only pene ht with this organization who is
asenazed to have any propensity for violence.

Agitator index subjects within the category of Black
rationeliste are STEVEY ABEL, 2 student spokesman and leader
at Howard University; NATHAN HARE, former profesesr at Sovard
and former chairman of the Washington Committee for Black Power,
now defunct. He was a professional boxer lsealiy, and hae
since moved te the Nest Coast for teaching assignment. As fax
as GASTON HEAL is concerned, informed sources believe he is
not a man of violeat nature, but in view of his past mental
illness, and the faet he has purchased a .30 caliber rifle and
anmunition wid tend te indicate that a propensity fer violence
on his part dees exist. He wis arrested on charges of disorderly

3) Organizations which appear te be of such potential
danger for counterintelligence consideration seem to revolve
around SHCO and its followers, and/or the organizations whieh
SCE actively support. Primary individual target: would be

4) In sennection with overall. consideration in

In vegard to SCC, RTO is probing for veeknesses which
may Be umeovered through sources in endeavoring ta ascertain the
identity of individusis who may be dissatisfied because of
personality clashes and/or these whe may be disenchanted with
volunteer services for SNOC and have sought. a salary; and those
whe may be suspect. of “working fox the man", i. @., suspeet of
being, an informer.

In vegerd te STOKELY CARMICHAEL, WFO has carefully
considered him. from a counterintelligenee standpeint since his
arrival in ¥O¢ to take up residence ln January, 1968. However,
no positive program has beer develaped due ta the fact that the
sedition investigation has. been under active consideration from
& proseautive atandpeint, and it was felt that a similtaneous
qounterintelligence program if operational against CARMICHAEL
might tend te aggravate possible future prosecution and possibly
lead to embarragsment. WEG feels thet « positive couaterintelli-~
genes program would be warranted against. CARMICHAEL, especially
in the absence of any prosecutive action against him. In
assessing CARMICHAEL for potential counterintelligence, WF has
concluded that to be effective, such a progrem must diseredit
him in the Hegro commmity vhere he enjoys considerable popu-
larity, and would seemingly have to be stronger than alleged immeral
or un-American political inelinations.

Coneerning the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) and the Washington Spring Project (WSP) office in WDC,
sources vio are familiar with SCLs operations have been instructed
to leek for opporturiities te plant seeds of discontent and
dissension betusem the SCLO and the American Friends Service
Comittee (argc) workers there, particwlarly in the realm of
funds; and to give risa to xumors that KING seems to be getting
the lion's share of the: funds, whereas the AFSC. and the poor
people who are to participate are getting Little or nothing
in the way of financial aid. It has been developed that WS?
reeruiter J. T. JOHNSON, since transferred, was at the center
of a controversy concerning dissension in the office. wWFro is
in the pracess of developing further plans saploiting this
dissension,

with regard to MARTIN LUTHER KING, WFO will continue
to be alert for ali possibilities to secure information of value
in counteriatelligenee and for use im the pregram. it is felt,
however, that the: offie0 of origin in this matter is in a better
position to fully eveluste and be aware of possibilities to
