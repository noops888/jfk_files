I have considered this matter, aiscussed it with

appropriate ajent and supervisory personnel of the Hobile

Office and the following is proposed as a counterintelligence

move on KINC'D lashington Spring Project.

KiNG has quite a rollowing in and around the salma,

Ala, area and has appeared recently in Jelma on one accasion

at the church of Reverend I. I. ANDERSON, who, at the time of

KING's appearance, was cuming for mayor of Selma.

ANDERSON.

was tentatively endorsed by KiNG and was subsequently dereated

in his race for mayor of Selma.

Reverend FREDERICK DOUGLAS REESE, Who is head of

the Dalize County Voters League and 1s quite intluenciul among

the

Negro community in the seins area, did not endorse aNDersoN

Ior mayor and intorned sources indicate he more or less cor

tributed to the dereat of ANDERSON.

Retse has been kno;n to

make derogatory remarks concerning KING and was allegedly

miffed that kind did not advise him, REESE, oi his, KINGS,

contemplated visit to selna.

In view of the above,

It is felt that if some

method can be devised whereby RENSE can be advised of certain

Items relative to the lashingion spring Projects

he would take

action to aiscourage indiviauals from participating therein.

It is not belleved that REESE could be contacted

by a Bureau Agent, although he his on occasion furnished us

information which

has proven to be reliabie.

home address, 1566 Range, Selma,

Alabama 35701, wherein it is called to the attention oi Rotst

that KING is merely using the Negroes of the Selma area for

his own personal aggrandizement; that he is not genuinely

Interesced in their weltare,

in all probability the individuals going to Washington for

the Spring Project will be left stranded ulthout suitable

housing or lood. The letter should also play up the poss1b111-

ty of violence, particularly the fact that although CArMICHAEL

and BROWN of SNCC have a so-called gentlemens! agreenent with

KING not to take over this action, there exists a strong

possibility that such will oecur.

There is also the possibili-

ty of RAM and NOI taking over the project since it lacks

organization and direction.

The letter should also point out

that KING was in Alabama on about 3/21/68, and did not make

his schedule in the Selma and adjoining counties area, which

was another indication that KING was talking out of both sides

of his mouth.

It is felt that this letter should be malled from

either Washington or Baltimore since, If the letter 19 mailed

from anywhere in the south, Ruise may feel it is the work of

the Klan or some other racist group.

It is felt that Baltimore

would probably be the best since a letter from hashington would

indicate the possibility of the sovernment doing this.

Simultaneous with mailing the letter from Baltimore,

it is proposed that a copy of the letter to REESE, together

and Publisher, Selma Times-Journal, Selma, Alabama.

letter should

indicate that attached was a letter directed to

REESE and that he, FALKENBERRY, might want to contact REESE

relative to REESE's receipt oi

the letter and what it said.

The thought behind this is to elve FALKANBERRY a

chance to interview RusSE concerning recelot oi the letter

and thereby create a nems story which could legitinately be

published and read by the Negro community Inte Selma area.

It is known that the Selma Tines-Journal has a large circula

tron among the negro county in ballas and adjoining countles

and has taken a rather 1iberal autitude in connection with

civil rights movements.

By handling as above, we would eliminate the

possibility of these rumors being attributed to the FBI.

Consideration has been given to some method of

discouraging ALBERT TURNER, who 1s Meld Secretary for KING s

project, and is spear-heading the recruitment throughout our

territory and other portions i Alabama.

From our contact

with TURNER, tho 1s a llaison source, it is the opinion of

contactin" agents that he is so sold on the project that it

Is almost impossible to disillusion him.

It is also felt that some method of getting an

article in the

"Southern Courier" along the lines of the above.

would have a discouraging effect on the Negro community in

and around tonigonery, Ala., since the courier Is very Widely

read.

Consideration is being given to the method of accom-

plishing this.

The Eureau la requested to consider the proposal

set forth above and advise.

the show and seemed to have been chosen for either their

Re Mobile letter to Miami dated 8/23/68.

Enclosed for Mobile is a copy of an article

which appeared in the August, 1968,

edition of "The Liber-

published in Miami, Florida.

ROBERT E. SCHWARTZ, the editor

of this publication was one

television program referred to in referenced letter.

The July 9, 1968, issue of "The Atlantic Sun",

a student publication at Florida Atlantic University,

Boca Raton, Florida, contained an article concerning

this

television program.

It quoted JAMES AGUT, also interviewed

on this program, as complaining of the editing of this pro- '

He claimed the program's bias was clearly shown by

the Director's remarks at the end of the program.

The television producer said the response to this

program was so good that they went to the expense of repro-

ducing it so it could be made available to a number of

civic organizations who have requested it for local showing.

They gave one copy of the film to the Miami Office, at no

cost, and this has been sent to the Bureau.

This program was given considerable advance publi-

city and was shown at 6:30 PM on a Sunday evening which is

considered "prime time".

Other specific reactions of a positive nature on

a program of this type are difficult to assess, and probably

cannot be fully assessed for a considerable time.

The interview was conducted by Rich-

that we were quoted in entierty, and in context. To

Effective propaganda avoids the excesses of

is absorbed by the

treasonous, traterous. seditious or revolutionary

¿ action conceivable.

Then, we were asked questions regarding the

new left in comparison with the

"old left," the

Trotskyite-left, the Moscow-left and the Peking-

left. Thus, the movement of the interview was

by the most uneasy thematic import:

And according to a basic law of

propaganda, "whatever is continuously and blatan-

tly ASKED, is incessantly and tenaciously

SUGGESTED." In other words, all talk about the

new left became quite academic and quite irrele-

vant before the real implications of our trial.

But with all of this... even while we were all-

owed to distinguish between the new-left and the

old-left, we were not consulted about our ideolo

Four staff members of HSCA recently completed

interviewing a number of RCMP personnel at RCMP Headquarters who

had been associated with the James Earl Ray investigation in

Canada. According to RCMP sources, nothing unusual was discussed

and the members were not asked any

questions that would indicate

that any new material had been uncovered by the staff members,

who were very amiable and courteous throughout the contacts.

The RCMP is now in the process of contacting approxi-

mately 50 residents of Canada, who were interviewed by

•the RCMP

during the course of the investigation, to determine if they would

be willing to be interviewed in Canada by HSCA staff members.

The Canadian Government has taken the position that

no federal employee, with exception of RCMP personnel, can be

made available for interview and, therefore, people such as the

person(s) who accepted application for and issued Canadian

passport cannot be interviewed.

The comments, as set out in referenced Atlanta

and Chicago airtels, have been carefully reviewed by

• this

office.

This office does have & completely cooperative

and reliable newspaper source who could be contacted to

publicize the situation as discussed in referenced commun-

icacions.

However, at this time Baltimore does not recommena

such a contact for the purpose of a neuspaper article. The

Washington Spring Project has been making little headuay here

in Baltimore.

There is an ofrice that functions, but the

office is not being operated very efrectively.

From our

sources, as well as the Police Department in Baltimore, the

entire project has simply not been making any headway.

FOT

this reason, it is felt that at this time it would not be

desirable to give KING and the Washington Spring Project

any publicity of any kind which might reflect reaction in

favor.

Baltimore, thererore, recommends that this

possibility be kept in mind and if at a later date, the

Washington Spring Project does get off the ground,

consideration would be given to the suggestions as set out

in these referenced communications.

that the wsr has not gotten off the ground yet.

These

sources have reported in general terms that it was their

impression that one of the recsons for this failure to make

adcquate progress is the lack of assurance of MARTIN LUTHeR

the project, baild money and attorneys will be promptly

furnished.

This was confirned by the Intelligence Unit

of the Baltimore City Police Departnent.

Hore specifically's a source reported that the

head of the istional Association For Dhe Advancement or

Colored People here in Baltinore contacted the MSP with

this

specific question in mind. No adequate assurance

was given by the WSP office.

It is not known by Baltimore thee this is a

the CId is used primarily by CONTAY, members of his family,

and several other people to pressure local authorities for

funds to pursue anti-poverty projects which are benericial

to the CONWAYS.

One individual associated with this

known.

The Nation of Islam (NOI) has Temple #6 at

Baltimore, Maryland, and Temple 735 at Wilmington,

Both temples follow

the teachings and directives of ELIJAH

MUHAMMED. Temple is has an estimated 200 memberg; Temple

The principal organization connected with the student

demands at Morgan State College was the society of Afro-

American Students (SAAS, a newly formed group of about 25

students of Morgan State College, which according to sources

was apparently formed with the advice of ROBERT MOORE.

The most active black nationalist group in the

Baltimore area is the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)

In the spring of 1966 a group of persons

on the national staff of CORE came to the Baltimore area and

took over the direction of civil rights activity which had

been originally started by the local CORE chapter.

This group

called themselves the Baltimore Target City Project. As a

result of their activity, the great bulk of the local coRe

chapter severed their connection with CORE and formed a new

organization which they called the Activists for Fair Housing.

They are now known as the Activists, Incorporated.

PersONs

associated with the CORE Target City Project have directed

or participated in practically all civil rights activities

in the Baltimore area, and they were also connected with the

activicles in Cambridge which resulted in riots there.

number of the activities of the CORE Target City Project

in Baltimore have resulted In arrests and in some cases of

persons associated with the CORE Target City Project being

charged with inciting to riot. Several persons associated

with CORt who have been more outspoken in favor of violence

than suited the CORE National Office have apparently been

discouraged from participating In CORE activities.

Recently intormation has been received reitecting

that a school called the

two individuals reported to be VIstA workers, LESTER VALLEY

and ALLEN NESBITT:

WILLARD DONOVAN DIXON and BENJAMIN MC MILLAN,

two local individuals who worked closely with the CORE Target

City Project

are now associated with the Soul School. Both

of these individuals were censured in the latter part of 1967

because of their advocacy of violence in a local CORE public-

ation, and it now appears that they are no longer associated

with CORE.

the National Office of the SCLO opened up an office at 604

west Mosher street, Baltimore, Maryland, Irom which ig being

organized the Washington Spring Project,

which is also referred

¿o as the Poor People's Campaign. Members of the CIG have

been working closely with thase people, but all elements of the

Negro community in the Baltimore area are being contacted by

the SCLC representatives.

The black militant nationalists who are currently

on the Agitator Index of the Baltlmore Office are as follows:

LIMUEL, DARNELI, CHESTER, JR., a 20 year old legro

resident of Cambridge and the leader

of the CBAF. CHESTER 1s

currently awalting trial for inciting to riot ai

director of the CORE Target City Project at Baltimore and who

has for a number of years been a member of the staff of

national CORE. GANT has led numerous civil rights demonstratlong

In the Baltimore area.

Cambridge, Maryland, and in Baltimore, Maryland.

3. Tne following are organizations and individuals

of their activities in the past.

SNCC and Its Baltimore leader ROBERT B. MOORE

1,. Operations Under Consideration

the soul school, Baltimore, Maryland, is presently

being considered as a target for counterintelligence operations

by the Baltimore Office.

This school purports to exist for

the purpose of teaching

black history and culture.

militants who are associated with the school are considered

among the most dangerous in the Balcimore area, Consideration

is being given to the possibility of bringing to the attention

o1 the Negro community the unsavory backgrounds of some of

these individuals who

are setting themselves up as educators

of the black community.

2. Operations Being Elfected

No operations are presently being effected by the

Baltimore Office.

The suggestion submitted by Baltimore

airtel dated March 8, 1900, was not put into effect at that

time because the Poor People's Campaign (PPC) was getting

off to a poor start, The slaying of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.9

on April 4, 1900, made 1e inadvisable to carry forward any

further plans to

disrupt the Ppe by the means suggested,

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC) has recently opened an office in Baltimore, Maryland,

In connection with the proposed march on washington by

SCIC. A racial source of this office has advised that

prominently displayed in the office are photographs of

MUHAMMED ALI SAN CASIUS CLAY. Copies

Additionally, there is indication that a representative of

the NOI in Baltimore has been in cortaci with SCIC represen

tatives here.

It is recalled that in 1966, KING and ELIJAH

MUHAMMED were not able to resolve their differences at a

widely publized meeting of the two.

At the present time, the SCLC is making very poor

progress in either getting organized, linding suflicient

people with funds to back the project, and in general

finding enough residents in Baltimore to go along with the

1des of such a march. Again according to our source, the

leaders of the scLe here are talking of picking a particu

lar area of the City of Baltimore and concentrating on that

area to gain support with the thought that thereafter to

spread to other parts of the city.

Attached to this airtel 1s a sketch of a suggested

2.

The active, black nationalist movement in the

territory of the Birmingham Field Division is

• lintted to Muhammad's Mosque, Nation of ISlam

(NOI), Birninghan.

This Mosque has an estimated membership of about

75 nembers.

It has the normal activity of an NOI Mosque;

three meetings a week and occasional social affairs open

to the public.

Birmingham's estinate is that this losque does

not have a propensity for violence.

It is loyal to ELIJAR

MUHAMMAD and follons his teachings without reservation.

The minister, JANES LONDON, frequently derides "black power"

and teaches that they use violence only in ansver to

violence upon them.

The only "militant

black nationalist" included upon

the Rabble-Rouser Index is TOUMY WRENN.

WRINK was an

independent candidate for City Council, whose campaign

did not invoke any use ai violence.

WRINN is a subsistence

INGRAM AS Follows:

He advised that the followig proposal was sent to

the Director:

The racial conference at the SOG discussed the

Washington Spring Froject headed by MARTIN LUTHER KING and

recommended that the facts about the Project be brought to

the attention of possible participants through a rumor campaign.

We would use our informants, without their knowledge, to spread

the story about lack of funds and organization. Fears of

economic reprisal and personal safety should dissuade potential

participants. We would point out also that the Project is

strictly for MARTIN LUTHER KING's benefit which is actually

the case. He thinks he can regain lost prestige by this

demonstration. Some suggested rumors would consist of:

The participants would be told that their names

would be taken in Washington and welfare checks from the

Government disconcinued.

Possible threats of violence and bodily harm to the

participants would be spread. Also infornation showing that.

the Washington Negro Conmunity is incensad and furious with

respect to this march on Washington by outside Negroes.

The above are a few

of the type of rumors that can be

used and you should cie in any sumor of this nature to your local

problem.

Also think of other counterintelligence methods and

secure telephonic approval from the Bureau prior to utilization.

I. SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP

CONFERENCE (SCLC)

MARTIN LUTHER KING

A. KING has changed the date of his

Washington Spring Project (WSP) on several occasions;

he has, on occasion, announced his anticipated presence

at various Locations, and then send a top aide instead

of appearing himself; he has periodically changed the

dates of his appearances in certain geographic areas.

Many times, announcements were made when KING was to be

at a

specific WSP meeting in order to draw a crowd, when

actually it was known in advance by KING that he would

not attend.

• JN 100-980

It is felt the above considerations can

be exploited to cause confusion in the efforts of KING

and his group, and to cause Negro dissatisfaction with

his operating procedures. This could be accomplished

by the following:

1) When KING is actually to

be at a gathering, have informants circulate false in-

formation as to time, date and location of KING's ap-

pearance, or variations of each, i.e., correct time and

place, but different location, correct location, but

different date, et cetera.

2) Have informants circulate

information that KING is to be at announced local meet-

ings of SCLC groups when, in fact, he will not be present.

3) Announce, through informant,

when KING is to'be at specific place, that this is only a

guise to draw a crowd, and only local leaders will be

present, excluding KING.

B. KING and his top aides dress expen-

sively, generally travel via first class means., and

stay at first class accommodations usually in predomi.

nately white areas of cities he visits. Recently, in

Memphis, KING ran fron his followers when violence erupted

during a march he was leading there:

It is felt the above

two considerations could be linked to' discredit KING and

his aides with poor Negroes who he is seeking support from.

This could be accomplished by the preparation of a flyer

showing photographs of KING and aides dressed well, next

to photographs of Negroes poorly clothed; under the photo-

graph would be data concerning

his expensive tates, ac-

connodations, use of private airplane, and related

KING's deserting his followers during the Memphis riots.

The key note message would be that KING and his aides

are out for their own financial and physical welfare

primarily. Flyers could be prepared from newspaper

photographs of KING and lis aides, or from some photo-

graphs available at various field offices. Distribution

could be by anonymous mailings to poor Negro leaders,

or by placement of copies at Negro meeting places by

informants.

II. STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING

COMMITTEE (SNCC)

This group has discouraged its members

from associating with whites. Information has been de-

veloped that some leaders and top functionaries, since

the establishment of this policy, have periodically

maintained close associations, to

include residing with

white girl friends. Information concerning these asso-

ciations could be capitalized on by counterintelligence

measures to show the hypocrisy of these leaders and to

discredit the individuals involved with their new "Black

only" oriented associates in the same organization, and

to discredit them with leaders of other Black Nationalist

organizations withhom they may be seeking support or

rapport.

Specifically, efforts could be undertaken.

to obtain photographs of the principals involved with

their white girl friends. The flyer could then be pre-

pared containing this photograph or photographs. Under

the photograph could be information regarding the princi-

pals' position with SNCC, followed by quotations of top

SNCC leaders regarding associations with whites or

Black Separatists statements. The flyers could be mailed

anonymously to pertinent National and local leaders of

SNCC and/or to leaders of other Black Nationalist organiza-

tions advocating black separatism, rather than simply

construed to be

QUARTERLY PROGRESS LETTER

Changes in Overall Black Nationalist Movement

in Jackson Division: No Change.

I.

OPERATIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION

By letter forwarded to the Bureau by Jackson

on May 11, 1968, the Jackson Division requested approval

for a counterintelligence measure against the chree main

Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Func-

tionaries in Mississippi - ROBERI EARL FLUTCHER, JR.,

HOWARD HERSCHEL SPENCER, and MARVIN LOUIS WILSON, all

Negro males.

This measure was designed to discredit these

three individuals by implying that each of the three are

informants of some Mississippi Law Enforcement Agency.

The measure was

to be initiated by submit-

ting separate anonymous letters to SNCC Headquarters in

Atlanta, Georgia, addressed to each of the three individuals.

Each letter would thank the addressee for providing certain

specified bits of intelligence

information regarding SNCC

• The letters to each addressee would be

"shuffled" so that letter to FLETCHER would be "erroneously"

II. OPERATIONS BEING EFFECTED

Bureau approval has not yet been received re-

garding operation being considered which is mentioned above.

The Jackson Division has effected some opera-.

tions through rumor campaign initiated regarding the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Poos People's Campaign

The following measures were implemented:

A. On April 24, 1968, IN 380-R (PROB -

GHETTO) returned from Washington, D.C., where she was ar-

rested with 35 others on April 22, 1968, while conducting

silent vigil around National Capitol building.

Source was

fined $700, given suspended jail sentence, and placed on

one year's Federal Probation for her participation in vigil;

source advised others arrested received similar serious

penalties for involvement. Source, on return to Mississippi,

Source to

s Campaign participants

as indication of severe manner in which they would be dealt

with by Washington officials if they went there with the

Poor People's Campaign. Source is a state leader in a pre-

dominately Negro Welfare Rights Group and is well regarded

by Negro poverty elements in Mississippi; source was subse~

quently veryvocal in making known her arrest and punishment

In Washington, D.C., to Mississippi prospective Poor People's

Campaign participants.

B. JN 386 - R (PROB) was, and still is, the

Jackson Organizer for the Poor People's Southern Caravan.

SUREN

He was encouraged by contacting Agents to emphasize

non-violent objective of Poor People's Campaign and

to be alert for any militant Negro infiltrators of

Southern Caravan who had propensity for violence. He

was instructed to likewise advise and alert his lieu

tenants in this regard and to make it known around

the Jackson area that no militants would be acceptable

as POOr People's Campaign participants.

III. TANGIBLE RESULTS

Regaraing A. above, in no small measure

due to JN 380 - R (PROB - GHETTO's) "arrest publicity"

efforts, participation by older, matuce, poverty-stricken (X

Mississippi Negroes in the Southern Caravan of the Poor

People's Campaign was minimal. The majority of the Miss-

issippi participants were youthful people, Negro males

and females.

Regarding B. above, JN 386 - R (PROB)

was personally instrumental in screening out many mili-

tant Negro youths from participating in any manner in

the Southem Caravan portion of the Poor People's Campaign.

He was especially watchful for anyone in any manner asso-

ciated with SNCC and any allegations he received in this

regard were grounds for automatic elimination of individual

as Southern Caravan participant.

IV. DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

INTEREST

The Jackson Division has disseminated per-

tinent information regarding known Mississippi Black

Nationalist militants to all appropriate local and. State

law enforcement officials. They, in turn, carefully

scrutinize activities of these individuals

for any indi-

cations that they may be breaking State or local laws.

Any violations result in rapid arrest. In this regard,

ROBERT EARL FLETCHER, JR., and DONALD WILSON JACKSON, Negro

Black Nationalist Militants from Jackson, Missisappi, have

each been arrested once by local authorities on minor in-

fractions over the past four months.

Additionally, any information received of

out-of-state Black Nationalists traveling to Mississippi,

is immediately furnished local and State authorities;

these authorities likewise scrutinize activities of these

out-of-staters while in Mississippi, for any indications

of law-breaking.

Recently, two SNCC members from Tennessee,

following FBI alert to local authorities, were stopped on.

traffic violation; their automobile was

searched and con-

cealed weapons and drugs were found, resulting in more

serious charges; charges are still pending and

Re Charlotte letters to Director dated 7/9/68.

and 7/31/68.

I. Operations Under Consideration

In connection with HOWARD LAMAR FULLER (Agitator

Index Subject), records of FULLER's telephone toll calls

were received from the Durham, N. C., Police Department and

investigation is presently being conducted to identify all

subscribers both within North Carolina and out of state to

develop his contacts. On analyzing the results of this

investigation, the recommendations will be made based on

available information as to what actions may be taken to

undermine FULLER's effectiveness as an organizer.

Recent information received from CE 2319-R (PROB)

to the effect that GOLDEN ASRO FRINKS, Field Secretary.

SCIC for North Carolina, is losing favor with the national

Leadership of SCIC. According to this source, a state-wide

convention will be held later this year at which time efforts

will be made to replace FRINKS, who is currently conducting

daily demonstrations in Hyde County, N. Ca, in protest of

a school desegregation plan accepted by Department of Health,

Education and Welfare. Separate letters will be submitted

concerning this matter on development of further information.

None.

3. Tangible Resulta

It should be noted that according to information

received, HOWARD LAMAR FULIER's foundation for community

development, Durham, N. C.. Will expend its funds as of

10/1/68. His activities after that date should be curtailed

due to lack ot money for his travel expenses. This matter

is being followed closely to determine the source of many

new funds.

4 Developments of Counterintelligence Interest

With the start of the 1968-1969 school year and

the re-opening of colleges, racial activity within the

Charlotte Division should increase. It should be pointed

out that there are numerous predominantly Negro institutions

throughout the state, most of which have some type Afro-

American organization on the college campus.

Charlotte has alerted its sources for any militant

activity in this regard, and the Bureau will be kept advised.

CE 2319-R (PROB) is in a position to assist in any

counterintelligence program mounted against COLDEN ASRO FRINKS

and to furnish detailed information concerning FRINKS. It

is anticipated that if sufficient information 1s developed

through this informant and in view of the voluminous

background data in the Charlotte files regarding FRINKS, a

proposal for counterintelligence activity will be made.

CE 157-6109

Charlotte was recently quite successful in a

counterintelligence program concerning Klan and militant

white groups wherein with Bureau permission data of a

public source nature was furnished to a trusted newspaper

reporter, who wrote a series of articles. It is anticipated

that all development of the proper information, the same

type operation can be proposed against FRINKS.

Re Charlotte letter to the Bureau dated 9/24/68.

The Bureau is requested to take under consideration

and to approve, if deemed advisable, the following counter-

Intelligence action to be undertaken in the Charlotte Division:

IN RE JAMES RUFUS BARROW:

Charlotte File 157-5813

Bureau F1le 157-7782

This Individual 1s on the Agitator Index of the

Charlotte Division and resides at 406 Van Norton Street,

Washington, No C.

Subject In April of this year organized a group

o1 approximately 300 Negroes to disrupt the schoos activities

at P. S. Jones High School, a Negro high school In Washington,

N. C. He has continued some degree of agitation in Negro

high schools throughout the area and has claimed to be associated

with the NAACP and the SCLC.

This Individual 1s well known to local authorities

as an alcoholle, and Information has been received indicating

that he may transport and use personally non-tax paid whisky.

Investigation has also reflected that this subject

has lost his driver's license on two occasions, once while

driving intoxicated and once for driving while his driver's

license was under revocation.

CS 157-6109

Through informants and local pollce department

activities, Charlotte feels that an occasion may arise in

the future

to know the occasion when BARROW w111 have

non-tax paid whisky in his automobile or otherwise in his

possession, and Charlotte feels that such information

properly handled could result in this Individual being

removed as a source of agitation in the Eastern North

so o it agitaton

Carolina area.

A conviction for possession of non-tax pale

whisky or driving while intoxicated, second offense, should

result in the immediate loss of his driver's Ilcense for

probably a year, which would tend to curtail this individual's

travel ability, and possession of non-tax paid whisky could

result in an active jail sentence, which would remove him

completely from the scene of operation.

REQUEST OF THE BUREAU:

The Bureau is requested to consider and approve,

Is deemed advisable, the furnishing to the appropriate local

and State authorities Information concerning this individual

having in his possession non-tax paid whisky, or while driving

under the influence, which it 1s anticipated

would result in

his arrest and possibly receiving an sotive jail sentence.

IN RE GOLDEN ASRO FRINKS:

Charlotte F1le 157-5267

Bureau File 157-7975

This individual is on the Agitator Index of the

charlotte Division and this Individual 1s Fleld Secretary

and Director of the SCIc and operates primarily in the Hyde

county area of north carolina at the present time. As the

Bureau 1s aware, this Individual has been a source of

considerable agitation and Interference in Hyde County of

the operation of the pubile school system. He Is currently

leading a boycott of Negro students of Hyde County schools,

and this matter has been presented in detail to the Bureau in

NW 54987 DocId:32989734 Page 96

## Page 97

CE 157-6109

Through CE 2319-R (PROB), Charlotte has learned

that FRINKS 18 allegedly carrying on an 11l101t affair with

a Negro teenager, a cheerleaders at the 0. A. Peay High

school.

The girl allegedly Involved with FRINKS 15 thirteen

years old, and it 1s felt that this information can be

utilized very effectively and possibly result in criminal

charges being brought against FRINKS. It 1s contemplated

that such Infornation relating to FRINKS, as his contributing

to the delinquency of a minor, as well as possible adultery

charges, would severely discredit him and might posaibly

result in his loss of position with scLe.

In addition to the above, FRInks 1s known to

drive at excessive rates or speed in his travels Iron one

location to another, and it is felt that through proper

Ilalson with the N. C. Highway Patrol, FRINKS can more

closely be observed in his travels, which will result in

his arrest for traffio violations relating to speed.

According to Information from CE 2319-R (PROB),

FRINKS has had some criticism from SCIC leaders concerning

his school boycott operations in Hyde County, N. C.

It 1s felt that the successful handling of oither

the first or second operations listed above could likeiy

result in charges or possible conviction and an active

jail sentence, which would remove FRINKS from the area as

an agitator, and at the same time, further discredit him

personally and the SCIC generally

'In the Hyde County, N. Cos

area. This could lead to his further difficulty with national

leaders of the scio.

REQUEST OF THE BUREAU:

SUMMARY OF BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT

JACKSONVILLE DIVISION

The Black Mationalist: Movenent in the Jacksonville

Division

is a relatively new movenent and is not clearly defined.

Informant and source coverage is under development and it is

anticipated that a more definite picture will be provided in the

near future..

The main activities are centered in the Gainesville

area: of Florida where the following organizations exist:

Students For A Democratic Society (SDS)

Gainesville,

Florida

SDS was organized in Gainesville, Florida, in 1966.

It has operated as an off-campus organization in that the

University of Florida has refused to recognize it as a campus

organization, At the time of organization, its membership was

Iisted as being 16 members.

Committee (SSOC) and the group was

then known as SDS-SSOC.

Later SDS was dropped from the name of the group:

SSOC has been described as the local branch of SDS.

At the University oi florida; the two groups,

reportedly,

are promoted as different groups

to give the impression of yet.

another "new-left" organization.

During January, 1967, SDS demonstrated in behalf of

a University of Florida student who was

placed on probation

for posing nude for an off-canpus magazine.

During July, 1987, SDS sponsored the "Viet Nam

Summer Florida. Institute" at Gainesville, Florida, which was

a part of the national protest movement against the war in

Viet Nam.

Since December, 1967, SDS has participated In a

rally against support of the draft, against compulsory

ROTC, and against reczultment by the Central Intelligence

Agency and Dow Chemical Company on the University of Florida

campus.

"The Florida Alligator," daily rampus newspaper,

University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, carried an

article in its 2/19/68 issue captioned,

"New Left Fever

Appears Dead."

The article pointed out that "despite their

recent efforts SDS has found it nearly impossible to arouse

significant student interest."

There is, however, a potential

for violence by an organization such as SDS, especially it

it gains sufficient support in the future from students at

the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida,

Southern Student Organizing Connittee (SSOC)

Gainesville,

Florida

The SSOC at Gainesville, Florida, has been described

.as the local branch of SDS and is supposedly promoted as a

different group to give the impression of yet another "new-left"

organization.

A letter released by the "Viet Nan Summer (Florida

Project)," Gainesville, Florida, sponsored by SSOC-SDS, during

July, 1967, stated that SSOC will open a Florida regional

office in Gainesville.

this office will help any peace anc

freedom group with literature, furms, speakers, and will try

to arrange conferences on movement issues for the State of

Flonida.

ALAN THOMAS LEVIN, ViCe Chairman of SSOC, on 10/9/67;

was described as founder of the Florida Draft Resistance

Union in Gainesville, Florida.

JK 157-1523

On 1/12/68, SDS-SSOC, Gainesville, had a meeting

to discuss what action should be taken against future military.

and private industry recruiters on the campus of the

University of Florida.

A protest against Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) recruitment on 1/15/58 proved

ineffective.

On 1/27/68, SSOC sponsored the "Florida Conference

fox Peace and Freedom" on the campus of the University of

Florida.

ANTHONY KENNETH IRVING, student at Florida

A & M. University, Tallanassee, Florida, made a statement

at this meeting to the effect that black people in the

restaurants could poison all the food for "whitey." If

a black man-can kill five whites,

then he can die knowing

that he tried to overthrow the white system.

CHARLES WRIGHT, possibly a student from A & M

University, Tallahassee, Florida, stated at this meeting

that he would be willing to personally lead a black army

through the residential streets of white America.

SSOC organized demonstrations against Dow Chenical

Company recruitmeni on the University of Florida campus

on 2/9 and 2/9/58.

SSOC is closely associated with SDS and may be one

and the same organization.

If it could gain a following and

support to carry out lis objective, It could present a

definite potential for violence.

Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)

Gainesville, Florida

IRVEN LEE DAWKINS, since the Spring of 1967,

claimed to be the Chairman

has

of SNCC in Gainesville and has

claimed that he was recognized as such by the national

headquarters of SNCC in Atlanta, Georgia.

He writes a

leaflet,

"The Black Voices" which is periodically distributed

in Gainesville.

DAWKINS and CAROL THOMAS, white female,

who is a long time Civil Rights worker in Gainesville, were

sentenced on 12/27/67 for contempt of court in Gainesville,

Florida, and were denied appeal bond.

JK 157-1523

On 2/8/68, they were released on bond by order of the.

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, New Orleans, Louisiana.

While DAWKINS and THOMAS were in jail, a number of fires

any devine in,

were started by incendiary devices in white businesses in

•Negro areas of Gainesville as well as the home of Judge

I. C. ADKINS, JR. in whose court they were sentenced.

Since their release from jail, at least eleven

fires have been started in Gainesville, Florida, by

incendiary devices.

On 3/15/68, IRVEN LEE DAWKINS and four other

individuals were arrested by the Gainesville, Florida

Police Department, on an arson charge.

On 3/18/58 another

Negro male was aprested on the sane charge.

They are

currently being held in the Alachua County Jail, Gainesville,

Florida.

Bond in the amount.of $10,000 was set for DAWKINS

and $7500 bond was set for the other individuals.

SNCe, Iwhich is composed of DAWKINS and a

group of

IOLlowers, are believed to have been responsible for the

burnings in Gainesville, Florida.

While the burnings have ceased, since the arrest

of DAWKINS and the five individuals there is always the

potential for additional incidents by sympathizers of

other followers of DAWKINS who were not arrested.

Florida: Black Fund (FBF)

A leaflet recently distributed by the above group

cane: to the attention of this office. It states that the

FBP was formed in Gainesville, Florida, out of a meeting of

Black Activists representing twelve Florida citiêst,

including Jacksonville, Gainesville, and Tallahassee.

•It

was established in an effort to unify the black comnunity

in Florida.

of years and is estimated to currently consist of from

25 to 30 members.

stressed the

supremacy of the black race, hatred toward the white man and

his religion, and an objection toward the war in Viet Nam and

Negro participation in this war. While the Noi, to date,

made available by WCKT-TV, Miami, to local civic

organzzations for their use...--

The Bureau has also been advised of some of the

statements made by JAMES RUSSElL AGUT, who was interviewed

during this progian. AGUT expressed his displeasure

of "The Libertarian Watchdog", an underground hippy-type

newspaper published in Miami, Florida, contained an

article by 1t5 editor-publisher, ROBIlT E. SCHWAETZ,

manner by an employee of the TY channel whereas the

questions were turned around and the interviews edited

to show them in a very unfavorable light.

He also

complained that the quotations by Director J. EDGAR

HOOVER at the end of the program were presented in a

much stronger light than were the interviews.

SCHWARTZ

indicated he desired in the tradition of "fair play"

Organizations

1: NOI

Mosque 29 of the NOI is located within the

Miami Division and has approximatily 85 to 100 members.

Twenty-five to 30 of these have been described as hard-

core members; others consists of a constant membership

turnover.

This group has

been established in Miamt for

several years and never known to have been involved in

any acts of violence.

Members are subjected. to the

nationalistic and hate-type teachings and philosophies

of the parent organization.

Being under the directi..

supervision of ELIJAH MUHAMMAD, the NOI in Miami appears

to have a propensity for violence only if directed to

violence by ELIJAH MUHAMMAD or if they or their properties

any propensity for violence.

3.

SCIC

SCLC in Miami is also a relatively small group,

with attendance at their weekly meetings ranging from

six to twenty persons.

Their

main interest and activities

appear to center around Miami's EOP program and they have

apparently little national direction.

The President of

SCLC in Miami was arrested by local authorities on

March 22, 1968, for grand larceny in connection with

anti-poverty funds SCLC in Miami has received.

The Miami Office is currently conducting an

investigation captioned "JIMMIE LEE CHATMON, PRESIDENT,

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE, MIAMI, FLORIDA;

ATROS L. LA SALLE, CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT,

FRAUD

AGAINST

THE GOVERNMENT" (Miami file 46-3743).

this investigation is an allegation that. SCLC in Miami

submitted false documents to EOP, a federally-funded

program, concerning the accounting systen utilized by

SCiC.

B. Individuals

The teachings and philosophies expounded by

the NOI are such that they should always be considered

as having a propensity for violence and therefore, the

Miami Division is considering counterintelligence

activities which might be taken against that organi-

zation within the Miami territory.

2. SCLC

Inasmuch as the SCLC is a loosely disciplined

outfit whose membership is open to any Negro in the area,

with very little discipline or self-sacrifice required,

this organization appears to be the only organization

within the Miami territory which could constitute a

rallying point for Black Nationalists who do not desire

or are unable to accept the discipline of the NOI. This,

together with the assumption that SCIC will be the focal

point for people from the Miami area desirous of par-

ticipating in MARTIN LUTHER KING's march on Washington,

would mark them as potentially dangerous. - The current

criminal investigations being conducted on the leader-

ship of this group would make them apparent easy prey

for counterintelligence activities.

B. Individuals

No individuals are being considered for action

under this program at the present time.

IV. Suggestions

Miami suggests that former members of Black

Nationalist groups, particularly the NOI, not be over-

looked in this intelligence program.

Former NOI members

who have been exposed to the hate teachings of that

organization but are no longer subjected to its

discipline should often be considered as potentially

dangerous with regard to racial matters.

v.

Miami is submitting a separate letter with

suggestions for counterintelligence actions to be taken

against the NoI and SCLC.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

Miami's SCLC Chapter raised approximately $3,000

to send local participants to the Poor Peoples Campaign

choir: Bra van Einston,

They decided to charter a bus for

their trip to Washington, and when it appeared they would

not have sufficient people to fill a chartered bus,

Greyhound officials recommended they travel on regularly

scheduled bus.

These people, however, insisted on

chartering a bus with a capacity for 38 persons at a

cost of almost $1400 for the round trip.

A total of 14 or 15 people traveled to Washington.

In this bus departing Miami 5/15/68.

Some of these

people remained in Washington or went on to New York City

on vacation after participating in the program and only

nine returned to Miami from Washington on the bus,

arriving Miami 6/24/68.

This chartered bus was an obvious waste of

money.

Had these people traveled to Washington via

regularly scheduled bus service, round trip fare for

nine persons would have been $50.35 each and one-way fare

for six persons would have been

$33.35 each for a total

cost of $675.75. These people, therefore, wasted over

$800 by travel on chartered bus.

If these participants

had flown regularly scheduled Eastern Air Lines flights

to Washington, their total cost would have been only

$1244.25.

•It is noted that the money raised in Miami was

raised specifically in the name of the Poor Peoples Campaign,

and it appears there must be considerable money not used

or needed for this program.

Miami's SCLC Chapter already has a poor reputa-

tion in connection with handling funds, particularly in

view of the fact the former President of Miami SCLC's

Chapter is

currently under indictment for Grand Larceny In

connection with EOPI funds handled through SCLC.

This

fact, together with the money wasted on the Poor Peoples

Campaign, presents an excellent opportunity for action

under captioned program.

Most of this information has been discussed

openly at SCLC meetings.

Bureau authority is requested to

furnish this information to CLARENCE JONES, a staff writer

for the "Miami Herald." Miami Office has had an excellent

relationship with JONES and information has been furzished

him confidentially in the past without his revealing the

Bureau as a source of this information.

If Bureau authority is granted to furnish this

information to JONES, he will be impressed with the

necessity of not revealing the Bureau's identity as

a source of this information. Miami Office feels this

action will in no way result in embarrassment to the Bureau.

RACIAL INTELLICENCE

Re Bureau airtel to Albany dated 3/4/68, and

Kiant letter to Bureau dated 4/2/68.

The following points are being considered for

counterintelligence activity in connection with this program

within the Miani Division.

No action, of course, will be

taken without Breau authority:

NATION OF ISLAM (NOI)

Mosque Number 29, of the NOI in Miami, currently

operates a commissary selling canned goods and staples, and

thoy also operate a restaurant.

These businesses are both

operated at the Temple.

It has also been determined

that at least one member of Mosque Number 29 is Living at

the Temple.

Miami will check with local authorities concerning

these activities, and 1f it is determined that any of these

activities are in violation of local ordinances, consideration

wild be given 10s the use in Miami Counterintelligence

Program. Action to be recommended will not, of course, be

werely harassment, but will be an attenpt to discredit

this organization in the eyes of sone of the legitinate

Negro business people in the Miami ares.

It is noted that

Mosque Number 29 recently has made an effort to pronote

themselves within this group.

Another situation which appears to have some

local counterintelligence potential,.

is the present

suspension from the NOI of SAMUEL SAXON.

SAXON has been

Captain of Mosque Number 29 for the past several years and

is a long time resident of Miami.

He was a very close

associate of CASSIUS CLAY and clains credit for recruiting

Clay in the noi.

Inforuation now available indicates

SAXON's suspension was in some way connected with a

misappropriation of Mosque Number 29's funds..

Bureau

authority has been received to intervier SAXON and alter this

matter.

SCIC

In connection with counterintelligence activity

against ScId, the Agent to whom the coordination of this

Program is assigned is going to assist the Agents handling

the Fraud Against the Government case involving Miami SCLE

Chapter mentioned in referenced Miant letter.

Through

these interviews it is expected that a counterintelligence

plan can be developed.

RECENT COUNTERINIELLIGENCE

ACTIVIIY BY THE MIAMI

DIVISION

It is noted for the Bureau that with Bureau

authority JOIN TILST, Chief, Security Section, Dade County

Department o1 Public Instruction, was advised on February 28,

1968, that ALVIN FRANKLIN DEAN, a teacher in the Dade

County, Florida, school systen, and an assistant minister

and frequent speaker at Mosque Number 29, had been convicted

In Knoxville, Tennessee, for nolesting somen. On barch 7,

1967, TYLER advised that DEAN's arrest and conviction had

been

verified by him and that DEAN had been released fron the

Dade County School Systen in accordance with their regulations.

Re Kiant letter to the Bureau, 8/28/68.

The black nationalist movement within the Miami

Division has changed somewhat since submission of referenced

• letter. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

whose charter was revoked almost a year ago had been operating

officially under the name of "Poor Peoples Campaign Support

Group" although they had been accepted in the Miami area as

an SCLC chapter.

They have become almost completely inactive

since the Republican National Convention at Miami Beach in

August, 1968.

They do not hold regular neetings and have

not organized or supported any particular civil rights

activity. Their only objective since the Republican National

Convention reportedly has been to attempt to collect money

to pay telephone bills occurred during the Republican National

Convention and the "Poor Peoples Campaign".

JIMMIE LEE CHATMON, former president of the Miami

SCLC, an agitator index subject. of the Miami Office appears

to

have

become completely inactive in the civil rights movement

in this area.

He has no known following and is not known

presently to be associated with any organization.

He is still

awaiting trial for grand larceny charges pending against him

in local court.

With the commencing of a scholastic year the United

Black Students (UBS) has re-established itself at the Univer-

sIty OI miami and is attempting to organize on the campuses

of Miami Dade Junior College.

from this post in November, 1968, and a permanent successor

has not yet been selected.

He clained his resignation was

based on acadenic reasons.

Since referenced letter, JIMMIE LEE CHATMON,

mentioned above, and THOMAS NICADOMAS SCOTT have been

added

to Miami's agitator index.

SCOTT is not connected with any

organization and reportedly only has a small following of

young Negro hoodlung.

I. Operations Under Consideration

Miami is considering resubmitting a request to

the Bureau to capitalize on recent allegations that the

minister of Mosque 29 of the NOI in Miani has been having

an affair with a female member of that nosque. Such allega-

tions have been circulating as rumors among members of

Mosque 29 and the Miami Office hopes to capitalize on this

through the submission of an anonymous letter to NOI Head-

quarters in Chicago alleging the minister is having such an

aLIaLI.

II. Operations Being Effected

The counterintelligence progrim is being considered

in connection with Miami's interview program of members of

the NO1.

Approximately 15 NOI menbers and leaders have been

interviered

since submission of referenced letter and it is

anticipated that 9 or 10 members will ba interviewed or

re-interviewed in the near future.

III. Tangible Results

It has been reported by NOI informants that the

minister of losque 29 appears quite upset by FBI interviews

of him and other members. He seems to fear the effect such

interviews will

have on members and at neetings has threatened

members with drastic action

'if they cooperate with the FBI

when interviewed. Members are told never to cooperate with

the FBI unless they agree to make an appointment for an

- tnterview at which time, he, the minister, should be

present.

He told members to ask contacting agents if

they have a warrant and if they do not haye a warrant

the FBI has no right to talk to them.

The minister's

frequent reierral to the FBI interviews have resulted in

xembors ridiculing him behind his back because he becomes

soupset at these interviews.

the minister, thus, 1s

Loosing the confidence somewhat of his members and addi

tional interviews with this point in mind should have an

even greater effect on the menbership's attitude towards

him.

IV. Developments - Counterintelligence

None

V.

Miscellaneous

It maz mentioned in referenced letter that an

assistant captain of Mosque 29 was apparently guilty of

bigamy and this would be exploited under captioned program.

Since submission of referenced letter this assistant cap-

tain has been expelled fron the NOI and therefore no further

consideration was given to that operation.

ReBuairtel to Albany and other offices, 3/4/68.

(1) SA EDWARD U. CRIM has been designated by the

Atlanta Office as coordinating agent for this program.

(2) The Atlanta Division has two main black national

ist movements. They are: SNCC, with appoximately 15 active

members and possibly 25-35 partially active members; and NOI,.

which maintains a Mosque in Atlanta having membership of about

75 to 125, with as many as 160 to 190 people appearing for some

of the open meetings.

It is estimated that, Atlanta SNCC office has

very

great potential, and that NOI has very little potential, for

violence, based on information available to Atlanta at this

time.

The following subjects of the Agitator Index are

considered militant black nationalists and might, in the

future, ba considered targets for counterintelligence action

because of their propensity for violence:

H. RAP BROWN (background not being set out

inasmuch as it is felt BROWN is widély known

to all persons handling this program within

the Bureau)

(3) SNCC is considered of such potential danger

as to warrant consideration for current counterintelligence

action.

This is based on information received concerniug

SNCC's purposes, which have been flatly stated as "to create

chaos within the United States so that the white population.

can

be brought to its knees."

(4)

Atlanta is submitting no overall suggestions

for counterintelligence action at this time.

(5) Atlanta will submit by separate letter sug-

gestions for counterintelligence action against SNCC in

the immediate future.

I. Operations Under Consideration:

NIO recently subnitted a proposal to the Bureau

regarding a "word of mouth" cunterintelligence neasure nong

selected sourcas to be directed against STOKOLY CARMICE EL In

an attempt to create the impression within the ghetto camunity

that he is in fact a paid agent of the Government.

In addition, it could be inferred that Government agents

are maintaining close tabs on CARIICHARL's bereabouts at all

times in order to afford him protection, not just in WDC, but

throughout the U.s.

The above is belleved to be one of parhaps a few

counterintelligence measures that could be effective against

CARMICHAEL. Any allegation of immorality or illegal activity

would only enhance his reputation within the ghetto.

CARMICHAEL, has not gone through with the purchase of

the $70,000 house, but it should not be overlooked that he is

already living in a house valued near $50,000, which a source

has reported is to be completely refurnished and has already

been carpeted throughout.

WED will reconnend dissemination to

appropriate neug media

in this respect in the near future.

WTO will continue to remain alert to situations wherein

a counterintelligence measure would be timely against the various

hate groups and individuals Involved therewith.

It ghould be borne in mind; however, that any sounter-

intelligence measure against any of these groups or individuals

requires a different approach than the usual counterintelligence

program. As pointed out above, regarding CARMICHAEL, any

Immoral or illegal act improves their Image within the ghetto

conmunity.

In addition, the very nature of some of the Individuals

which comprise these groups lends to a certain disunity. fit -

itself as Illustrated within Resurrection City. Perhaps more

thought should be given to breeding discontent within the varioas

groupst

which if successful, would render a leader "groupless."

HEO 157-1292

II. Operations Being Effected:

As pointed out above, WFO has submitted a proposal

to the Bureau regerding CARlICHAEL and will implement same upon

authorization by the Bureau.

III. Tangible Results:

HEO was in the process of submitting a recommendation

regarding the purchase of a $70,000 house by CARMICHAEL, proposing

release of this information to appropriate news media for

publication upon consumation of the purchase, when news articles

regarding this purchase appested. As the Bureau is aware,

CARMICHAEL, and MIRIAM MAKEBA thereafter cancelled the contract

to buy this property, claiming inability to obtain suitable

financing. As the Bureau pointed out, it has had an effect

on his reputation among some black militants.

IV. Developments of Counterintelligence Interest:

It is noted that hu has continuously considered what

would be effective counterintelligence measures against various

hate groups and certain individuals such as CARMICHAEL. The

April, 1968, riots in WIC and the presence of the "Poor Peoples

Campaign"' has certainly influenced the course of action by some

of these groups and has in fact been responsible for the creation

The "Black United Front"" (BUF), which CArMIChAEL

formed, has been more noticeably active as

of late and recently,

for example, took a definite stand on the shooting of two white

policemen by a Negro robbery suspect and his accomplice in the

sbooting, stating black men have 3 right to defend themselves

againat the "honky" policemen.

The news media has been dominated by the above since the

assassination of DI. MARTIN LUTHER RING, JR., and perhaps calls

for a different approach to an effective counteringelligence pro-

gran. than prior to the lots. It is further felt that a more af

effective use of news bedia could be made In the future In that

an article may receive nore attention hamz during the past few

months

WED will remain alert to situationg which can be

capitilized on under the counterintelligence program and will setso

advise. Bureau under individual case captions along with

appropriate recommendations.
