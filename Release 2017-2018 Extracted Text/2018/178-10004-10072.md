A... .xemember later hearing all kinds of allegations
about Lumumba and how he had been killed and why he had been
killed. I remember also the fact that the -- it was abundantly
clear that the Agency had had nothing to de with his demise
but whether there was a plot on the Agency at sometime or
another to.try to bring about his demise I was not familiar with
it. I want to say here I will obviously do the very best ft
can with my recollection but when you consider how much has beeri
in the newspapers about a number of things in the last period of
years it is pretty hard to stick in time when you first heard

about something. — . ne Lo.

i made of the Agency to deliver guns.to dissidents in the

Dominican Republic? : mee

A I don't believe I was familiar with it at the time
| although I can't Say. I certainly heard about the gun business

later because I had occasion to go back when President Johnson

asked. me about. this. episode at one time to look into the records

to find out about Trujillo. ‘I could find no evidence that the

Agency had been responsibie for his demise but 1 did find
evidence at the-time that there was an opposition group in the
United States Government was anxious to have the Agency support
and assist and I think I may very well have known about the
opposition group at the time. ——

I’ have no recollection any longer that I was privy to the
sending of any guns fo: to. the Dominican Republic and if I was,

I don't recall they | were ever identified as being designed. to

kill Mr. Trujillo. tf know there was a desire on -the part of

whatever Administration was in power then, they didn't Like mr,

Trujillo. They like mr. Duvalier and certain others but I was
| aware of no attempts to bring about his death through Agency

assets, | Lo. Me ~

J. think -since you have raised this question of an, assassi=.|-
nation 1 would like to say something as a generality here,

Dearly in the game when Colonel Galloway: was my boss in

to me one day that the Agency should certainly have the
capability to get rid of foreigners when required and that this
had to be done secretly and you should never ask your boss for
permission to do these things, and so forth. I remember at the
time.arguing with him about this and saying that I though that
there was no possibility whatever that the United States Govern
ment could develop a capacity to kill people because you. could
never keep it a secret. Sooner or later, maybe after five year

__ten years, Lord knows what, someone would come in or write some
Congressman and say the Agency was responsible for killing so
and so and aside from the morlity of it I felt it was impracti-
cal for the US Government to do something like that at this tim
I felt that way all the time I was Director. _I never; in my lif
towards killing, murder, assassination of anybody 6f whom r an
aware, and so I can only tell you that as the years have ‘gone
-by, as I say, quite aside from moral asepets of this thing,

the improbabilityof ever being able to do anything like that as
an American Government agency has become less and less viable.

In fact, I have often said to associates that there are

three things that the American people would never stand for.

. One-is asSassination,. two is rapé, and_.thtée is dealing in-

drugs. So that I didn't want anybody in the Agency thinking
that any of those things were going to be satisfactory to me.

was the mention of three handwritten names by you. One was

-even crazier idea ‘which had’ toe do with some kind .of a thing

that might be planted | on the Beach’ where Castro walked in the

morning and it would blow up when he put his foot on it, or’

something. - There were more nutty ideas. It reminded me of

‘the time of oss ‘when ‘somebody wanted to get Propaganda into
Germany. and they discovered there was a herd of cows “that

grazed in Germany and were milked in France, | so they devised
some suppositories into which there were put a lot of
Propaganda leaflets and those were put in the cows on the
theory they were being left on the German side of the border
when the cows were grazing and nobody would be the wiser.
So to say there are nutty ideas cooked up in organizations
like this is to tell the truth,

ts there any evidence, may ask, Mr. Belin, is
there any evidence in the record that any Director authorized
what t can only refer. to by. the dictionary definition of

“an assassination of a foreign leader?
Q. Well, there is evidence in the record, Ambassador

Helms, that there were plans made to try and assassinate

Premier Castro of Cuba, that there were several series of

plans, and that the plans at at least one or two of the

say they didn’t take place. I just don't have. any recollectioh
of it. I can't think today why I would have not wanted him
briefed about something. I mean, after all, one of the bases
on which this Agency has always operated was that the Director
was privy to know anything that went on. That was established
early in the game.

forthing-with allegations of things that happened that never

did happen and as I look back-on the whole period, with

“all the effort’ that was made in money and manpower, and

so forth, devoted to try and unseat’ the Castro government,
when one laoks back at it it was a pretty pitiful effort
and I think a great deal of it was just, what shall I say,
talking a good game. ~
Q Now, .do you have any recollection of any briefing
ef McCone about any Agency plans in which Harvey or Roselli
or sheffield Edwards may have been. involved other than
Exhibit. 4? --- °
A. I don't have any recollection of that, Mr. Belin.
Tr want to tell you that all I recall was that McCone was
constantly asking about how we were getting along with the
Cuban operations and McCone was constantly being briefed about
what we were trying to do about these operations but what
was in all those briefings L ‘have. no recollection any more
at all and no matter how I would work. on this I would. never
be able to sort it all out. It was --a “lot of effort was
being made, all kinds of things to get boats and to train
Cubans to man those boats and land on secret shores and all
kinds of things. . a

A ~ May T ask a question at this juncvare? Since Castro
is alive and well in Cuba, what is the problem about these
--.-txrying to verify all this business about whether these

attempts were made or not made? I mean, does it make any

Qu Well, there are two major areas of concern apart
from whether or not assassination should play any part in
american policy. One area concerns how the plans were
authorized, whether they were directed externally or whether
they grewup internally.

- o> whe, second area concerns what I would call internal moni-

_ toring and control. If Mr.McCone: didn't know about it, other

than that priefing, that. poses a.problem so far as an Agency
operating under control. T£ you did not know about it until
the spring of 1962, and the information that Ir have gathered
indicates that. you were. not privy to any. information about
this until the spring of 1962, you were in a fairly important
position in the Agency .and yet were not’ aware of what could
have been a potentially disastrous-operation,’ certainly. an
operation “chat had all kinds of ramifications for this”
country when one considers the trigger of World War I involved
an ‘assassination attempt. : - vue .

And so, therefore, the scope of my inguiry is not
necessarily to say it is this person's responsibility but in

large part it is to determine how these plans got organized

and how they were kept under control, and I should tell you
that it is my information that, although you did not have any
information about this prior to the spring of 1962, that

in the spring of 1962 you were made privy to what I am: joing tc
eall Phase I which | was the Giancana phase and also, what T am
going to cali Phase II when William Harvey took over the
operation, and that Mr.McCone, according to the records that
I have seen, was not briefed until the August 16, 1963
memorandum, in part because of the fact Mr.McCone had not
been DCI. at the time the plans were undertaken, so the
-documents say that I have seen, and. that at the time of his
.briefing in August of 1963, it was not an oral briefing but
rather limited to a discussion of the. Giancana matter in

the memorandum for the record addressed to Senator Kennedy,
Exhibit'4.  - ne

Now, is there anything that.1 have said which disagrees
with anything that is to the best 6f your recollection?

lot of this either. So -~ : “Lae ,

7~Q .- Now, do you remember Senator Kennedy coming over
to the Agency on or about March 8, 1967, to review this
memorandum for the records that was Helms' Exhibit 4 that
pértained to his 1962 briefing? : _ a
A Senator Kennedy visited the Agency to do that?

Q Do you have any recollection of a project known

as Project Amlash?

A Amlash? By that name, not any more.
Q Did you ever?
A... Don't forget, Mr. Belin, that there were hundreds

of these things.

Q Do you have any recollection of any man by the
nane of Rolando Cubela who was a cuban who at one time had
been associated with Castro and then became disaffected
with him?

A Let's see. Was he the fellow who eventually ended
up in Paris or Madrid or something of this kind?

Q Yes. At one time he did and then eventually

he ended up in Cuba but he was met by Agency people

A what was his particular cryptonym?

Q Well, among other things, some Black Leaf 40 had
been developed to be delivered to him in a pen which had been
constructed to’ have a hypodermic needle with the object to
inject the Black Leaf 40 into Castro. And that was delivered

to himlin Paris on November 22, 1963. Do-you: remember?

A .-I certainly remember Cubela-, L.certainly remember
the fact that he was, I think -- was he a defector from the
Cuban regime. . a

the skin-diving suit was but I want to tell you these came
up every day, some hairbrained idea like this to do some-
thing about Cuba, but that’ these -actually were carriec out,
tr don't recall any instances of hts I don't recall any approv.

or that any assets were developed to do these things. These
were a lot of, things: that were discussed and I am sure they

carry them out. a - - oo

delivered arms all over the place in connection with Cuba.

that I don’t know that Dean Rusk wanted to get rid of hin
but certainly President Kennedy wanted to get rid of him.

Q You mentioned that the Attorney General, Robert
Kennedy, was. intimately involved with Operation Mongoose. And
there appears to be a corroborating memorandum prepared by
you dated October 16, 1962, pertaining to this, and It wonder
if you would read this memorandum and see if it refreshes

your recollection.

LA 6 October 1962. When was the Cuban missile crisis?
Q The Cuban missile crisis, fT believe, was in October
of 1962.

AB Colonel Patchell. TI had forgotten all about him.

Q This letterhas ‘been marked Helms'. Exhibit 5.

A That sort of lays it out, doesn’t it?

Q Ambassador Helns, having read the Helms' Exhibit
No. 5, this is a memorandum which you prepared which appears
to have been. prepared on October 16, 1962, the date that you
met with the ‘Attorney General, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q And to the best of your recollection, aia the
attorney General express the general dissatisfaction of the
President with the Operation Mongoose?

AR I have every reason to believe that what I wrote
in that memorandum was the best of, my recollection of what
was sai@ and. what went on in the meating described. .

you ever talked to Harvey, incidentally?

the record but at.least there is some written documentation,
but I don't know whether made contemporaneously, that there
was a decision not to brief DCI, McCone, the memorandum
having been talked about earlier.

point. = _ . .

Q Surely.

A- - This plan that Harvey was alleged to have, how
far did it.ever get? I mean, what I am trying to get at
here. is that we are dealing with a lot of conjecture, a lot
of thoughts, a lot of ideas. Now, did any plan get down to the
point where somebody was about to get in a boat or, airplane
and go to Cuba and do X or Y and it shows I approved this
happening or was this something he was going to try to develop
and see if it could fly and if. there was any possibility
‘that it might work, and so forth? ,

was contact did get to Cuba with pills’ and with --
