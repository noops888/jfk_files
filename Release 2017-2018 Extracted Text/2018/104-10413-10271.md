On 7 August 1963 the Station EE case officer requested LIENVOY coverage of
the Yugoslav lines. Arrangements are being made to put these lines in within
the near future,

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information.

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish from ten
lines (five Cuban Embassy and five Soviet Embassy). DIR~60764 dated
13 August 1963 asked the Station to send to Headquarters one copy of the full
transcripts from the Cuban Embassy lines. These are being forwarded on a
weekly basis, The first group is being forwarded as an attachment to HMMA~22000
dated 21 August 1963, If they do not please Headquarters officers who desire
them, it is requested that the Mexico Station be promptly advised with any
suggestions for changes,

On 6 August 1963 Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, arrived.in Mexico
to work presently.as a unilateral monitor but eventually aa the supervisor of
a tap center either under LIENVOY or@@MiJBMYPO} He has established himself
outside and is presently at work eliminating the backlog of Soviet tapes.

Douglas J, FEINGLASS continues to do the Russian from LIENVOY,
the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from
the LIPAWN audio operation. In addition, FEINGLASS sends clipped transcripts
to the Station ready for 201 files.

4, Exploitation ‘of LIENVOY Information,

HMMW-11831 dated 6 August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was
not well informed on the way the Mexico Station exploits operational leads from
LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART has instructions to alert
the Station immediately if a U.S. citizen or English speaking person tries to
contact any of the target installations. This is done by a telephone call from
outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B, RIGGS inside the Station,
Emergency meetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch).
RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a pre~arranged downtown
location and receives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation.
The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible
for the target the person was trying to contact, Headquarters is notified by
cable of the action taken. Only in rare cases is information on a U,S, citizen
passed without prior Headquarters approval. |

Other leads appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen, They
also are exploited by the Station’ case officer responsible for the target where
the lead appears. For example, on 12 August 1963 Boris KAZANTSEV,
recently arrived Counselor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target
in Mexico, .called his wife at their residence. The number was not listed but
was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the
number was the switchboard of theapartment house where KAZANTSEV and
several other'families live. The reason the Station checked out this number
was to put unilateral coverage on it if possible; however, the switchboard was
beyond the Station's capability tohandle.

Maryknoll priest Felix McGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on
31 July 1963, MEX1-5565 reported details of this contact. This cable was sent
to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Professor WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louisiana contacted Mexican
Communist Jorge L, TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel-
lectual and professor at the University of Mexico, and arranged to meet with
him on 31 July 1963. MEXI=5568 reported this contact to Headquarters for:
dissemination and action by ODENVY,

Bartolo (fnu) contacted former Governor of Baja California, Braulio
MALDONADO Sandez on 16 July 1963 regarding the sale of Cuban pesos. MEXI-5569
reported this contact to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

5. Liaison

On 15 August 1963 Willard C, CURTIS met with(LITENSOW’ to arrange

for a sensitive PBRUMEN case (MEX1=5789 reported the details of this meeting).

6. Security

7, Technical

last report and he is handled as an independent agent by the Station, with no
LIENVOY personnel aware of his presence in Mexico, Robert B, RIGGS sees
HORSFALL daily to deliver and pick up tapes.
