MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECTS : A. Jack Anderson 20 January 1977 Column
. Titled "CIA Tied to False Oswald Story"

B. Identification of the Mr. X in the
Anderson Column

1. The attached column, citing the testimony of a Mr. X,
alleges that a CIA agent tried to link Oswald to Cuban intelli-
gence officers in Mexico. There is, of course, no substance to
the column's allegations. The column identifies the source as
Mr. X because of attempts on his life, but subsequently gives
enough information on Mr. X to establish his identity.

2. According to the Anderson column, Mr. X was first met
by his CIA contact in Havana before relations with U.S./Cuba were
severed. Mr. X had helped to organize bank accountants to ei-
bezzle Cuban government funds to finance anti-Castro causes.
Mr. X was reportedly recruited by a Morris Bishop (CIA contact),
to ‘plan an attempt on Castro's life. The plan was to fire a
bazooka from a nearby apartment building while Castro was deliver-
ing one of his marathon speeches. According to the Anderson
column, the plot was discovered by Castro's police and Mr. X
escaped to Miami. Mr. X also reportedly tried to assassinate
Castro in Chile in 1971 in league with the Venezuelan Luis Posada
Carriles, who is now being detained in Caracas for the 6 October
Cubana airline bombing. The Anderson column ends with the report
that Mr. X worked for CIA until 1975 for expenses, but ‘was paid
$253,000 in cash by Morris Bishop when he was terminated.

5. From the above description of Mr. X, it is reasonably

iclear that Mr. X is Antonio Carlos VECIANA Blanch (201-312966).

VECIANA, an assistant bank manager and past president of a public
accountants dssociation in lavana, first contacted CIA_in Havana
in December 1960 when he asked the COS, at that time fi
to help in an assassination plot against Castro. VECTANNaSKtT
for visas for ten relatives of the four men assigned to kill Castro,
and also requested four MI rifles with adapters for grenades plus
eight grenades. The COS did not encourage VECIANA and subsequen
checked with an Embassy officer who reported that VECIANA had ma
similar “wild-eyed" proposals to him. On 23 November 1961 the
Miami News published a report of an unsuccessful attempt by Antonio
VECIANA to kill Castro. VECIANA reportedly had arranged to
assassinate Castro and. Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos on 5 October
in Havana, but the bazooka he was using failed to fire.

ly

4. There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA. A
POA, which was granted for his use in para-military affairs in
January 1962, expired in November 1962. VECIANA was born on
4 October 1935 in Havana. He was a member of the People's Revo-
lutionary Movement, an anti-Castro group. in Cuba during 1960-61, and
was one of the founders of Alpha-66. A certified public accountant
by trade, VECIANA was with A.I.0. in La Paz in 1968-72. VE TANA
was registered in ISR to the U.S. Army in November 1962 and he
was terminated without prejudice in July 1966. On 23 July 1962
VECIANA was interviewed, at his request, by Mr. Harry Real from
the DCD New York office. VECIANA asked Real to arrange a meeting
with a senior CIA officer to discuss Alpha-66's plans to assassinate
Castro and to request CIA's assistance (U.S.$100,000; 10,000 Cuban
pesos; 48 hand grenades). ‘There is no indication that this request
was ever acted upon by CIA.

"S. In April 1966 a LA Division officer, H+. using
the alias John Livingston, met VECIANA in New York City. The

meeting was arranged by a retired naval officer, James Cogswell,

who had informed Chief, Wil Division that he had information of value
concerning Cuba. When arrived in New York City for the meeting
he was introduced by Cogswell to VECIANA. He immediately Launche
a discussion of the Cuban political situation and noted his strong
feeling thatthe only solution was the assassination of. Castro.

nadvised VEGIANA that he was in no position to provide him with

assistance or encourage him in an assassination attempt and was only
interested in yvathering information which he thought was the purpose
of the mceting. VECIANA subsequently said that his roommate Felix
ZABALA, a_Cuban refugee, had excellent contacts in Havana. It was
clear to however, VECIANA was attempting to use. ZABALA poten-
tially to get Agency financial support for his organization.

AWA ssuggested that $50,000 would be needed to get his

factivities eff the ground. | indicated to VECIANA that he
would look into the ZABALA matter and would probably arrange for
ZABALA to be “contacted in Puerto Rico.

6. There:is no indication in the file that any Agency officer
in contact with VECIANA ever used an alias Morris Bishop. There is
no Morris Bishcp listed in true name in the DDO rolls. There was
never any contractual relationship with VECIANA and he was not
paid CIA funds.

7. On 11 January 1977 a sanitized copy of VECIANA's 201 f£ile
was made available to staffers from the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence.

Mystery” iy

+i Amystery wit

gressional investizators that 2 Central
Intelligence. Agency agent introduced
him to Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas
three months before Cswaid gunned
down President Jon F. Keanedy...

-* The wimess, whom we have agreed «

‘to identify oniy aa Mr. X because of at-

~ tempts of his life, is the founder of a

Cuban terrorist group that worked
~clesely with the CLA.

‘The group held secret meetings at

= 3126 Houandale in Dallas betore the as-

sassination. Not long aiter Kennedy °

‘was shot, a Dallas deputy sheriff was
told by an informant that Oswaid had
. been associating with some Cubans at
is "38 Harlendale.”:
“" Mr. X's dramatic testimony ‘casts
“new light on the story Sylvia Cdio,
daughter of a wealthy opponent of Cu-
ban Premier Fidel Castro, told to the
FBL Two montks before !
killing, she related, she was 7
her’ Dallas apartment by three men
‘who identified cea as fi fends
+ of her father. i
One was introduced to her as “Leon
* Oswaid.” When she saw the picture ia
the newspapers of the man who had
shot Xennedy, she fainted from shock.
It was the same Oswald, she was cer-
tain, who had visited her apartment.
Congressional investigators have
now learned that the late J. Edgar
Hoover deliberately misled the ‘
ren Commission about Odio's mystet
ous visitors. She was such a persuasive
witness that the commission staff was
preparing to investigate her story
thoroughly.
Staif members even speculated, ac-
cording to one internal memo, that the

antiCastro forces ‘might have re
eruited Oswaid, a known; pre-Castro
activist to sill Kennedy.

- “The motive on this,” states the me
mo, “would of course be expecta:
that after the Pr apt was
Killed, Oswald would be caught or at
least bis identity ascertained; the law
enforcement authoritiss and the pub--
‘He would then blame the assassination
on tha Castro government; and the call
for 2 forceful overthroty would be irre
» Sistible.”

But Hoover ‘abruptly blocked this”

‘line of inquizy by notifying tae War-
rea Commission on Sept. 21, 1964, that
the. FBI had lecated and identified
Odio'’s callers, He named them as

<Loran Hail, Lawrence Howard and.

Wiliam Seymour, all anti-Cestroites.
Hoover even suggested that Odio could
have confused the names “Loran Hall”

_ and “Leon Cswald.”.

Now the congressional investigators
have uncovered evidence that all three
denied visiting the Odio apartment
and that the FBI had obtained their.
deniais before Hoover wrota his letter
to the Warren Commiss:

The investigators have als obtained
the tape of a fascinating conversation,
predicting two weeks in advice that
Kenaedy would be shot “from an o:
dee Duilding with a high-powered
fle.” The prediction was made by the
late Joseph Milteer, a right-wing rab-
ble rouser, who also happened ve
elose connections with antiCastro
leaders.

- The conversation was taped on Nov.
9, 1963, in Miami by an FBI informant
: named Willie Somersett, who turned
the tape over to the FBI the next day.

Milter is heard on the tape deseribing

- cluded that “his credibility is strengt!

. ent with what he told us before. Sigaif-
‘ icantly, he remains very strong on the _

“cording to the memo, that he had

nedy “knows he is a marked maa.”
Milteer later admitted to the FBI?
that he had been in-~Dallas in June, -
1963, but denied having any knowl-”
edge of the Kennedy assassination. -
Horvever, the ingormant told the FBI.
that he asked Milteer after the saoot-
ing whether he nad kmown about it ia ~
advance or had merely been guessing.
“T don't tdo any gu ” replied Mik
teer.:
But the most axplesi development EE
is Mr. X's statement taat he met Os
wald in the company ofa CIA agent.
Congressional investigators questioned :
the mystery witness closely on three
separate occasions. They finally con:

ened by tae details he provides consi

‘The encounter occurred in a dos
town Dallas building, where Mr. X had.”
an appointment with his CLA contact.
‘The agent was accompanied by a man”
whom bir. X later Tecognized.as Kea"

“When he saw it was Oswald that
Killed Kennedy,” the investigators re--
ported in a confidential memo, “he.
nearly ireaked out, but he never sai
anything.” SS

The investigators tried to pin down~
Mr. X on how be could be sure that
man was Cswald. iir..X replied, ac-»
