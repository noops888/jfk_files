MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD | lee lets

SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern -

1, I met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning
in GG10, where he is cleaning up some details before ‘he goes to
his new assignment as DC/DCD. I told him generally about our’.
attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial

‘transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections he may eee
have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966. 0 wee,

2. Halpern s2id that he has no recollection about such an -
assignment. In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des fae
FitzGerald when he became the DD/P. At about that time “- i
Halpern's father died and he was in New York for the funeral
and ten days of religious observations following that.” He was back
in mid-June and in end out from then on as he got ready to attend
the National War Gollege which began in August. . He did not return

to that office until the end of June 1966.

.° 3, Halpern observed that-during this period Karamessines' .*
was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely
possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this: -
on their own, 7 ie ie ieee

- 4, Halpern said that] had come into the office
of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned -
from Honolulu for that purpose. He stayed on for FitzGerald, until
Halpern returned from_the National, War College. He suggested
someone might talk to; lwho may have known something

about it (although he may not). He also suggested talking to Georgia. :
