JOHN PRIZIOLA, Detroit Hoodlum, Fathpr-in-law

. : &

BUONO, on 3/24/64, advised he knew FRAN BOMPENSIERO
very well, He stated that BOMPENSIERO "bucked" TONY MIRABILE
(now deceased) for control of the rackets in San Diego following
World War II,.and BOMPENSIERO has always been close to the
MATRANGAS. BUONO stated that it was his recollection that
MIRABILE and BOMPENSIERO made an agreement whereby BOMPENSIERO
operated North of Broadway in San Diego and MIRABILE operated
South of Broadway. This was prior to the time BOMPENSIERO
was sent to prison on a bribery conviction in 1955.

BUONO did not recognize the photograph of MARCQ
LIMANDRI, but stated that he first. met JOSEPH J MANDRI \F
in San Bernardino through one RALPH SPEZZANO (fhonetic), ou
a bail bondsman. LIMANDRI was then said to be active in
narcotics and prostitution. LIMANDRI later came to San Diego.

JOSEPH ERNES TRANGA was believed by BUONO to
be the head of the young Italian hoodlum element in San Diego,
and his brother, GASPARE MATRANGA, was once thought to be the
enforcer and strong man of this group.

PRIZIOLA was not’? known to BUONO.

BUONO was asked to identify "ARNATO" or "ARNOTO"
(Said by LA 4448-C-TE to be the "Capo Regime” of the San
Diego group). BUONO stated that this name was familiar

information to a Telephone Company Special Agent.

JOSEPH ERNESTO MATRANGA and FRANCISCOQ..ISADORE.... L
MATRANGAare married to daughters of Detroit hoodlum: JOHN Ole
PRIZIOLA, and it may be that the MATRANGAS have a group of
hoodlums over which they exercise some control without being
actual members of the La Cosa Nostra.

an informant, and although at first he appeared to.be
cooperative, he refused to furnish any information concerning

getting the place ready to reopen it. However, a check of
