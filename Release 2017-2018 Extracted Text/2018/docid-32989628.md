- On 3/10/74, Mr. DONALD B, SCHEWE, Assistant

co 'Dibrarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt

.Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised of our interest in

between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT. and former
“Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of |
August, 1936. Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation
“was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.
EDGAR HOOVER of the FBI may have participated in this
‘conversation. Mr. SCHEWE was also advised that Mr.’ ROOSEVELT

' . allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation

‘to'a memorandum and that we were interested in locating
this memorandum or some information bearing upon above
conversation. Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE
.at the Franklin D, Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,” Z
on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime :
he would conduct some research in this matter.
: - On 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had
conducted some research relative to our telephone call
on 3/10/75, and inquired if we could be more specific
with regard to the dates of the information desired.
SCHEWE was advised that to the best of our knowledge the
conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D,
‘ROOSEVELT (FDR),HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on :
approximately 8/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned
the internal security of the US. sanec mo

aut Mr. SCHEVE, at-this point, furnished a Xerox
copy of a “buck slip" dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is ao aos
attached) on White House stationery, classified "Confidential |
and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR", - re
_ Mr. SCHEWE stated that "buck slips" are nothing more
‘than a cover memorandum utilized to transmit communications
“which are attached thereto. It is to be noted that this
"buck slip" indicates that attached to it was a memorandum

"+ for the Secretary of State, unsigned, undated and

_ recommending coordination of activities of all agents’
_ of the Government in foreign countries. SCHEWE advised



that the synopsis of this memorandum which« cappears ¢ on>

¢he "buck slip" was the usual practice at that time to
qdentify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.

that this was the only document he was able to locate -

which may-have some bearing on the desired information.
SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the.
referred to memorandum may be located among the collection
of papers of CORDELL HULL which are now stored al the
Idbrary of Congress, Washington, D.C.

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to aatemiicuiag peveonied

the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was
hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment
book contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM

-FDR departed the White House for a visit”
._ to the flood areas in wy, Ohio and Feeeee a
. ,- vania.

Thursday, August an, 13936, FDR returned
._ to White House at alu 5 AM.
- + 9320 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER fron :
- 9:20 AM to 10: 12 AM. : art

(Note * - There is no entry in ‘this ‘book
a for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.
ea _ HULL was there. Mr. SCHEWE advised that
sReEEeLEre, -, 4t.is interesting to note that. FDR met
+ -°- Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White
House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for
‘ Ris office in the White House. SCHEWE
‘also pointed out-that this meeting was
significant since FDR.met with Mr. HOOVER
on 8/2/36, immediately after returning ©
from an extended trip. This, according
. to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's
usual practice,

. There was no record in the White House -
Usherts Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate
that FDR met with either Mr. HULL or Mr. HOOVER on that
date, This book indicates that FDR departed the White ~
House on Tuesday, 8/25/75, at 10:40 PM for a trip to the
draught areas, in upper. Maine, South Dakota and North :

campaigning. FDR returned to the White House on
. 8/10/35, and remained there until 8/13/36, when he
again departed on a trip and returned on 8724/36.
FDR also departed from the White House on 8/25/36,

sonnel § SENSTUDY 1975

ah me
ron IB ae _ are bt Se

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church
and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee,
Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee i
avery responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing
the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that
the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence
in the intelligence agencies,

Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that _ {
the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic * f }
activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies pentigeve
have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary we
to prevent such abuses in the future.

Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central
Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies
involved in domestic ‘intelligence.

The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately
40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary
background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance. Miller
indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in
this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the
FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being
furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being personally
satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance.
Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement, He stated that
he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary
Committee was on the impeachment inquiry. Our experience in this regard
was pointed out wheréip Judiciary Committee in coma eS with the 17
wiretaps had weitten te adder indicating thai ie we mi gpacen eS G yf

Memorandum for Mr. Callahan
Re: SENSTUDY 1975

information available they would afford it appropriate security restricted
to members only, excluding staff, and would not make the information
public, Subsequent to the hearings, the Committee published its report
which contained our classified documents right along with the Top Secret
classifications. Senator Church was not aware of this, appeared surprised
by it, and stated surely the information must have been declassified. I
advised him that not by us and it was our information.

Senator Church was asked whether in his opinion the formation
of the Select Committee would have any effect on the proliferation of
committees seeking to obtain testimony from the FBI and it was his opinion
that this would have a favorable effect. He said he had been in touch with
other members of the Senate who felt that it was a waste of time to have
repetitious testimony on the same subject matter before a variety of
committees and he had the feeling that the other committees would hold off
until after the Senate Select Committee completed its hearings. He indicated
that he could not vouch for what would happen in the House, however, he
intended to speak to the House leadership in order to try to effect some
coordinated approach there also, because he was well aware of the large
number of committees seeking to provide oversight or obtain information
from the intelligence agencies. :

A question arose as to the extent. of cooperation with the Committee
and Senator Church was assured that the FBI would be completely responsive
subject to certain limitations which would have to be delineated by the
President in order to protect sensitive sources and information. Senator
Church indicated that he was going to talk to the President in this regard in
order to secure his complete cooperation, and it was Senator Church's feeling
that the Committee should be entitled to answers to any questions they might
ask without restriction other than, of course, the identities of informants.

He felt the progress of the Committee would be severely impaired if it were
necessary to go to Court over such questions to obtain enforcement of their
right to have access to whatever information they need.

Dear Frank:

tian Hs 4 a

Reference is your request for comments on the sample
abstracts prepared in the FBI as a report on materials being
provided to the Senate Select Committee.

As you know, we want to make the Community Registry as
complete a record as possible of what is provided to the
Committee, and_for this reason hope that the actual oOpy Or eal
special reports an tant docume

el eet Where this is not done, an Serect

io) ary of each document or homogenous set of documents.

We have amended the abstract format slightly to include
an entry for "Document Classification." A copy of the
amended format is enclosed.

Your sample abstracts require a few alterations to make
them more "indexable."

a. Item 1, "TITLE/SUBJECT" refers to the subject
matter of the material which is being provided. The
abstract on the FBI Manual of Instructions should have
an entry here something like “Instructions covering FBI
Investigations in the Security Field," rather than the
title of the Senate Committee.

b. The date at the head of the page should be
the date of preparation of the abstract. The date of
submission to the Committee is listed at Item 9.

Cc. The entry "ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION" identified
the organization with authority to release the document.

that

Enclosure: as stated

da. The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should
be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is
being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for
instance, whether your sample on the letterhead
memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods.
The summary as written gives no indication as to
the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the
single sentence now used to describe all of them covers
the waterfront.

e. If the request for information comes officially
from the Committee, the Committee title should be entered
under "REQUESTOR," but if the requestor is an individual
member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.

f. The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS,"
has particular significance since it is important to
know if there are Third Agency, or sources and methods,
or other sensitivity problems involved, and this is
the place to identify them. We are beginning to use
the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to
obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with
the document for which another agency must concur in
the release. The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such
other agency an idea as to whether we see any important
reason why they should be concerned about release of
the document. The entry in this final section of the
format is expected to prove useful for this purpose.

5. One copy of the document or its abstract is all
is needed by the registry.

6. The mailing address of the registry is:

SUDJECTMECROPHONE SURVETLLANCE aascteseee "158-26

Galifozsia, ae U. os 8 aroun the use of microphone: surveillences
by city police in a genbling casa makes appropriate a reappraisal oF
the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of
Investigetion of microphone surveillance in connection with matters

relating to the intemal security of the country.

y that in some instances the use of microphone
“only p paseihie way of uncovering the activities
iH mnasihla sahotanrs, and subversive persons. In
vances E am of the opinion thet the national interest requires
curveillence be utilized by the Federal Bureau of
This use need not be limited to the development of
evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in
on with internal security matters equally as important as
ing evidence for presemtation to the courts and
ational security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone
lence for the prover discharge of both of such functions.
The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance
_ by the FBY under these circunstences and for these purposes.

¥F do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court
in Irvine v. Califor ia, supra, requires a different course. That
case is readily a nguishable on its facts. The lenguage of the
Court, however, indicates certain uses of microphones which it would
be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga-
tions. Tt is quite clear that in the Irvine case the Justices cf the
Supreme Cours were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of
installing & microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization
of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shoc
Court's action is a clear indication of the need for discretion and
intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all
cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the installia-
tion of a micrephone in-a bedroom or in some comparably intimate
location should be avoided wherever possible. It mey appear, however,
that importent intelligence or evidence relating to matter t
with the national. security can only | be obtained by v1 “Unstitletion of
a microphone in such a location. % is my opinion, that under such
s the installation is vroper ane is not prohibited by the”
s decision in the Irvine case,
Page 43

Previous interpretations which have been furnished to you

as to what may constitute trespass in the instellation of microphones,
» suggest that the vir expressed have been tentative in nature and

have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow

rather than reflect the present state of the law. It is realized

that not infrequently the question of trespass arises in connection

with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a

trespass is actually involved end the second question of the effect

of such a trespass upon the admissibility in court of the evidence thus

obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances

of each case. The Department in resolving the problems which may arise

in connection with the use of microphone surveillance will review the

circumstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities

of investigation and of the natioal interest which must be protected.

It is my opinion that the Department should adopt that interpretation

which will permit microphone covérage by the FBI in a manner most

conducive to our national interest. I recognize that for the FBI

to fulfill its important intelligence function, considerations of

internal securitv and the national safety are paramomt and, there-

fore, may compel tne mrestricied ue of this techiigque in

interest. :

ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures
prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current
Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these
figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a
hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability
the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign
threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends
that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate
Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment
in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as III C,

ADDENDUM: LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION pyp:akel“4-14-75

Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division
concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to
counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the
Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:

(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this
ivision has had with Fred B. Griffith of the Inspection Division, it
igappears that the information contained in this memorandum may be

classified confidential under Executive order 11652.

(2) Before making any determination as to whether we
make such information available to the Senate Select Committee, it
would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to
such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be
consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted
Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested
he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast
position that this information not be made available to the Committee or
that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for
this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such

as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the
Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

On 4/11/75, from 10:00 am until 12:20 pm, staff Ri
members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence fe
Activities were briefed by Assistant Director Wannall and
members of his staff in the Conference Room at INTD, Brief
from the Committee were Mr, William Miller, Staff Director; V
Mr. Frederick A, 0, Schwarz III, Chief Counsel; and

Messrs, Mark Gitenstein, Marvin Epstein, Patrick Shea, Britt ?
Snider and Loch Johnson, all staff members, 7

The first hour of the briefing was occupied with Af
the showing of the INTD slide presentation and commentary
which provided highlights of the work of the INTD, both in
the counterintelligence and internal security field, Following
this presentation a question and answer period ensued for the
rest of the briefing. Mr, Miller and Mr, Schwarz posed most
of the questions,

In the dounterintelligence field the thrust of the
questioning was directed toward the continuing growth of the
hostile intelligence presence in the United States and its
short-term and long-term effect on the FBI's operations,

Mr, Wannall pointed out that the Director on previous occasions
had indicated his intention to "beef up" the counterintelligence
effort of the FBI by the addition of some 250 Special Agents,

and that INTD had also effected certain programs designed to
assign certain counterintelligence functions to non-Agent
personnel, thereby freeing additional Special Agents to function
as case officers, In response to a question’ as to whether the
additional investigative effort necessary to counter the

mounting hostile intelligence threat might not involve investi-
gation of more and more American citizens, Mr, Wannall couseeg

Briefing for Staff Members

hat this was inevitable, He stressed, however, the investi-
ative policies of the FBI which protected the constitutional
ights and right of privacy of such individuals,
On the domestic internal security side the thrust
of the questioning appeared to indicate an interest in the
predication, duration and administrative controls of investi-
gations of domestic organizations and individuals, Again,
Mr, Wannall stressed the precautions inherent in FBI policy
and instructions to the field in these matters, pointing out,
in effect, that these investigations are founded on statutory
authority and are closely supervised by experienced personnel
at Headquarters level, The Committee staff appeared to accept
these answers and no critical or hostile attitudes on their
part were evident,

The briefing was terminated at 12:20 pm, due to
commitments on the part of the staff, Mr, Miller and
Mr, Schwarz both expressed their appreciation for the briefing
and indicated it had been most instructive, They indicated
a desire to continue these discussions at some later date and
Mr, Wannall assured them that he would be happy to continue
the briefing at any future mutually agreeable time,

Perhaps most significant of all questions posed was
the final question by Mr, Schwarz in which he inquired as to
what advantages and disadvantages to the FBI could be anticipated
as a result of the Committee fulfilling its mandate, Mr, Wannall
replied that any statutory authority defining and affirming the
FBI's role in the intelligence collection field would certainly
be a positive achievement, He also stated that any result of
the Committee's investigation which would tend to limit the
investigative resources or the investigative effectiveness of
the FBI would surely be an unfortunate negative factor,

At 3:17 p.m., 4/22/75 former Special Agent Ligh Whitson
who for many years was a supervisor in the Intelligance Division
telephoned me to advise that he had received a request to appear
for an interview by Michael Epstein, staff member of the Senate
Select Committee. The interview was scheduled for 4/23/75,

In response to a question by Mr. Whitson, he was advised
that to the writer's knowledge this was the first former Bureau
employee who had been requested to appear for an interview by any
member of the staff of the Select Committee, Whitson stated that
he was proceeding on the basis that he would respond to questions
propounded to him but he had some reservation in his mind concerning
answering questions which would involve material which he knew to be
classified at the time he retired. He commented he had noted in the
news media that staff members of the Committee were reportedly to be }
granted clearances through TOP SECRET ~ Q (Atomic Energy Matters).

Whitson was advised by the writer that while it was true
staff members were being granted clearances, the Bureau was endeavoring
to establish procedures through the Attorney General whereby highly
sensitive and classified material could be revealed on a restricted
basis in response to Committee inquiries; for example, in some
instances we would request that only the Majority and Minority leaders
on the Committee be furnished certain types of material and in other
instances only the Senators themselves as opposed to (a staff | me} YS.

Mr. Whitson said in view of Pee at as nis intefition fot
as responsive and candid during the interview by Mr. Epstein as he
could be but if any questions arose in his mind with respect to
revelation as to what he, Whitson, considered to be sensitive material,
he anticipated he would express his concern to Mr. Epstein and advise
him he felt it would be appropriate to check with the Bititdeistl middie:

There exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are directed
toward profit without regard to the restraints of the iaw. Yel, by the

: For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identify
these resources of the criminal.element. Congress responded to this
need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The Congressiona
findings were that organized crime in the United States is a highly
sophisticated, div ersificd, and widespread activity | that annually drains
billions of dollars from America's economy by unlawful conduct and by
the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption. Legitimate business and
Jabor unions are infiltrated and corrupted and ow’ democratic processes
are subverted. The problem was declared to be of of national concern

did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains

menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt. "Criminal
intelligence" collection is one means by which this responsibility may

be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity

of witnesses willing to testify and ofthe high mortality potential of those
who do appear. A classic amp of such intimidation is reported in

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

: You requested an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct
ee " domestic intelligence investigations. The question .of the jurisdictional
. | * basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic
aut : pee Division and will not be discussed here,

.. - It is fair to say that the domestic intelligence program is one
of the more controversial areas of the Bureau's activities. “For one thing,
an intelligence investigation casts a broader net than inquiries that are
airceted toward the proof of a snecific offense. A large amount of raw data
is collected, much of which has no immediate bearing on potential offens
or offenders. But seemingly trivial information may later become impo
in the detection and prevention of violence or civil disorder. ‘There are
also fears that these investigations may eventually touch upon one’s
” political beliefs, habits or associations; or that information collected for
proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Government,
* Each is a legitimate concern, The notion of Government prying into the
personal lives: of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there isa
strong sense that the Government must acquire necessary intelligence
: information if it is to meet its responsibilities in connection with the
7 national security.

One of'the major concerns about our domestic intelligence

activities is that they are not supervised or monitored by any outside

agency. The claim is made that the Executive Branch has been Jeft wide
diseretion to define its own authority, and to choose the directions, methods,

- and focus of its investigations; For one thing, the law has never made

clear what facts and circumstances must be present to authorize an
intelligence investigation, nor how far such an investigation may lawlully
procecd without being directed toward proof of a specific offense.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our electronic surveillances in
security matters are not submitted for prior court approval. For another,
the exclusionary rule which provides the usual method of judicial control
over investigative procedures, is not often available in security cases.
Since the goal.is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the
courts, As arecsult, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very
little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters.
and what we do with the information acquired,

In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have
pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form ofa
- watchdog committee to oversee our operations. Senator Ervin, who chairs
the Senate Subsommittee on Constitutional Rights has expressed particular
concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government to
gather information. In.an exchange of correspondence with the Department
of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation of the
Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic
intelligence information, He has also suggested that legisiation might ve
enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can
- be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measure would
ie pass the Congress, -but the proposal does show the mood of the times,

_ Aparalicl trend may be developing in the courts, In several
recent cases, plaintiffs have made the*claim that Government information
‘gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspects,
may have a "chilling effect"! on the exercise of First Amendment rights,
: oe These challenges thus far have not been successful, Anderson v. Sills,

_ to First Amendment*rights. Thus, in Davis v. Ichord, 442 F2d 1207 (D.C.
. Cir, 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional
Committce’s investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was
insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or
- controversy, This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear of
investigation by the present Commiitee home io themselves," their fears
were wholly speculative; there were ng criminal proceedings contronting
them; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in Davis found
« that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the
investigation; whenever a Committee of the Congress seeks punitive action,
the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a
judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional
rights, :

This latter aspect of the Davis decision was given perspective oy
the Court of Appeals in,Tatum, In contrasting the potential impact on First
Amendment rights occasioned by investigations conducted by the military

with investigations conducted by 2 civilian investigative agency, such as the
-. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Court observed:

faasastaceonacten The compilation of data by a civilian investigative
{PREEEEEEE ecoeceeeee at agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the ~

| : . of free speech that such action by the military is, because
sat a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always
being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and ©
the approval of the courts, * * *

There, the Court pdntedly examined the "source of the chili" as it had in

+ Davis, and in applying the "chilling effect doctrine", singled out the FBI
as a source which does not generate a reasonable basis for pales or
apprehensions, In this connection the Court stated,

RE: FBI AUTIIORITY IN DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Referring to our holding in Davis that the
"source of the chill" is important in determining whether
there is any inhibiting effect on the exercise of First
Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant
difference between investigative actions taken by a
military agency in reference to civilians and similar
investigative actions taken by a regular investigative
agency of a civilian branch of the Government.
art One of the functions of a civilia an investigative
i seein agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is
é : + to compile information on‘law violators, agitators of
"violence, and possible subversives, It has always been
recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is
exercised under the direction of the Attorney General,

and the information compiled is only usable and effective
through court action. The EBYis powerless to imprison
or to affect his liberty in any way except through the
action of the cour ts, . :

As to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of
{nformants, it has been held that such survei Nance is not per se actionable,
See Donahoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (B.D. Va. 1971) (police
surveillance of street demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment
rights),

The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S., 385 U.S. 293 (1966), held
that the use of secret informants is “not per Se unconstitutional", and does
not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against: self- ~inerimination, nor
the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and
seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,
admission at trial of evidence obtained by an undercover informant to whorn
a defendant spoke without knowledye that he was in the employ of the police.

Moreover, the Supreme Court in U.S. v. White, 401 U.S, 745

Amendment, even when an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit

of the restrictions}

are some wach iexe applied:

: ‘ Security cases are evaluated.continually

Information Storare and Retrieval
i The storage and retrieval of information is a
_ basta operational necessity of any investigative or
i “4ntelligence-gathering agency. Procedures within the FBI
for these functions provide for written records of informa-

tion received from a variety, reese~confidential

informants, confidential, > techniques, and open

“uap invormation in different

_ sources-~and the storage ox
types of files, These include active investigative files
on organizations and individuals and sone general files.
These “vaw" files are maintained both at the Seat of Governe-
mont and in’ the various field offices. “Information in the
+ files is thoroughly indexed so that data can be retrieved.
In the intelligence field, when an allegation

within the jurisdiction of the FBI is received, a case on

an individual or on an organization may be opened, depending
"on the quality of the allegation. Nonspecific information
that is received on an individual or organization is placed

in the pertinent file, if one exists, or is placed in a

general file if the organizats. ér individual is not the

subject of a specific file.



eteeeeeeet These files are an integral part of the intelligence-
gathering function. By the yery nature of the FBI's assignment
%q coordinate internal security information, the maintenance

individuals. Invest reports include

A major thrust of Professur Eliff's paper concerned FBI authority
derived from levislative enactments as opposed to that derived from Procidential
directives, beginning with a dircctive issued by Prosident Roosevelt in
September, 1939. Professor Eliff is of the opinion thet the 1939 dirsetive,

which was reitevated on three subsequent occasions, was megnified by the

FBI from its original purpose to & definitive order to conduct intelligence-type

investigations ,

Senator Sam J. Evvin, as you know, had been probing into the
nature and extent of FM intellgenco-type investigations. ator Ervin had
even, announced that he jutended to propose islation to prohibit the “BI
from investigating any person withcut that individuel's convent, unless the
Government has reason to believe that person has committed a crime or is
about to commit a crime. Other Congressmen indicated a similar Interest

in PUI investigative activities.

that the FBI had declared publicly over a

at lis responsililities in the dcmosti

ed under iogislative enactmerits, ¥
instructions of the Attorney General, ‘Che Pres: :
the 1) directive dated September 6, 1939, and, iterated January 8,
duly 24, 1950; and December 15, 1953, and 2) Exceutive Order 10451

* April 27, 1953 (and amonded but not yet implomented by Executive Ordar
11605 dated duly 2, 1971).

Our study revealed
long pericd of {ime th
are autho:

In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated
September 6, 1939, and considering that the subsequent circetives ere all
hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misco on as to the oxtent
of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the Fil by these directives. It
eppears that while the 1639 directive fixed responsibility on the FUL to handle
espionage, sabotege, ond neutrality matters, it did not convey any authority
or jurisdiction which the FBI did not already have from legislative enacteents.
Yids difficult to read into this directive or in any of those which followed any
authority te conduct intelligence-typo investizations which would or could
not be conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.

4 As a matter of historical fact, Prosident Roosevelt in August,
1936, did request fortaor Director 1. Edgar Lioover to eoudact investigations
of subversive activities in this country, inching communiem and fasciem.
This request, however, was a conliriontial oral request and there is doubt
that any record of it was made outside the FRI, This request, or Presidential
mandate, was be mtally, an the fuct thet the law provided thet the
FRI coule conduct such invostigaiions if the Gccrutary of State should sa

Based on this study, we believe that hod there never been a
single one of the Presidential clrectives in question the PRI would have
conducted and witl, through necessity, continue to conduct the sare intelli~
genee-tyre investi: rctud from 1939 to the present datc.
We also believe, however, that ja order to counter the criticism end skepti-
eism of such individuals as Prof. and Senator Bam J. Ervin that
an up-to-date Excculive order should be issued clearly establishing a need
for inteligence-typs investigtions and delincating a clear authority for the
FBI to conduct sth investiguiicns based on guidelines ostablished by the
Attorney General aud adhering to constitutional principles.

he requirca in the pugsuit of his responsibilities based on our stalory
authority. In other words, there is a need, from eur standpoint, for both
authoritative and definitive guidelines. The statutes give us the authority.
The Executive order would define our national security chjectives.

: Members of Congress, including such men es Senator Robe:
Byrd of West Virginia, have proposed lei: fon to spell
authority of the FUL in this field. It would appear that the Preside
rather spell out his owa requivements in an Executive wy instead of having
Congress tell him what the FBI might do to help hisn fulfil his obligations and
responsibilities as President.

The political climate of suspicicn end distrust vesulting from
disclosures coming out of the Wat te heurings could sent an chutocle
to getting any such Executive order signed in the immediate future. Uowever,
the rufionale is nevertheless valid ond when scrutinized closely, # ERATE
in the Kxccutive order we hereinafier propose establis: Gcfinitive guidelines

with this. : :

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures
prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current
Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these
figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a
hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability

threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends
that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate

ON-INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Ih connection with our investigations of staff members for
captioned Committee, we have developed derogatory information on two ( x
individuals which has been brought specifically to the attention of William Miller, ,
Staff Director of the Committee, One of these involved Mrs. Diane Floise
LaVoy whose sister-in-law questioned her loyalty and declared she "does not *
love America." The sister-in-law said Mrs. LaVoy constantly criticized the LS
U. S. Government and its policy and underlying weaknesses of our society.
Another individual said she was highly critical of CIA activities. This information
was pointed out to Miller on 3-25-75 when the results of the investigation were {
delivered to him, and he also was advised that the CIA would be furnished the sam
data in accordance with our agreement concerning these matters. 2g

On 3-24-75 and 3-28-75 results of the investigation coxjeérning 3
Mrs. Betty Dale Ellison were delivered to Miller and he was advised that a pri
supervisor with eight years of training and experience in psychiatric care stat
he felt Mrs. Ellison needs psychological examination, He termed her a troubl
maker and said he would have fired her if he had the authority. He described
her definitely as a security risk due to her mental and emotional instability. I
also was pointed out to Miller that other former supervisors described her as
unstable when working under pressure and unable to get along with fellow empl
Miller was told that this information also would be furnished to CIA.

Miller also advised on 4-2-5 that their review of the Ellison
investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and
he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only
real solution to the situation seemed to be that she not be added to the staff.
Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard.

‘These views were conveyed to Miller on 4-9-75. Miller stated
at that time that they had resolved the situation by assigning Mrs. Ellison to
purely administrative tasks and that she would be fully isolated from any sensitive
or classified information in connection with her responsibilities.

At 11:00 a.m. on April 17, 1975, Inspector John B. Hotis
Special Agent Paul V. Daly and I met with Deputy Attorney General Tyler ,
and Associate Deputy Attorney General James Hutchinson at the request i bk
of the Deputy Attorney General. Lo4

Deputy Attorney General Tyler advised that he had been requested
by Burke Marshall and F.A.O. Schwarz, Il, who are consultant and General
Counsel, respectively, for the Senate Select Committee, to meet with
him on Monday afternoon, April 21, 1975, to discuss matters relating
to the Committee's activities. The Deputy Attorney General said that he
has been personally acquainted with Mr. Marshall for a long time and also
is acquainted with Mr. Schwarz. He considered the possibility of having
a Bureau representative attend the meeting, but then decided it would be
best if he would meet with Marshall and Schwarz privately to determine
whether they desire to discuss details of the Committee's responsibilities
and if it became necessary, he would request the Bureau to send a

representative to the meeting. REC 4A b eve 3 Gs a | 4

The Deputy=sttdthey General said that he would, of course,
advise us orally or in writing of the results of his-eonferen¢é with Mr. Marshall
and Mr. Schwarz.

The Deputy Attorney General inquired as to,the procedure

currently being employed in responding to the CSmmittee 's requests
and Inspector Hotis explained the current procedures. I mentioned to the
Deputy Attorney General the existence of the Ad Hoc Committee of
Intelligence Agencies and suggested to him that he might desire to designate
a representative to attend those meetings in order to be on notice as to the
policies being developed by the White House and the intelligence community
in responding to Committee requests. I explained to him that James

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Department's representative on the Committee, but he has now been
reassigned to responsibilities at the White House. I told him that
Assistant Attorney General Scalia had been scheduled to attend the last
meeting of the Committee, although he was unable to attend. The
Deputy Attorney General said that he would discuss with Mr. Scalia
the possibility of having Mr. Scalia attend as the Department's
representative.

I asked the Deputy Attorney General whether he was undertaking
the principal responsibility in the Department for matters relating to the
Senate Select Committee and other committees that may be inquiring
into the FBI and he said that that was not clear as yet because the Attorney
General has taken a personal interest in these matters and it appeared that
the responsibilities are still fragmented within the Department. It was
his opinion that the responsibilities should be centralized and he appeared to be
willing to undertake that responsibility.

It was my impression that the Deputy Attorney General was
interested in being of assistance to the FBI in these matters and expressed
a willingness to cooperate by having the FBI participate as much as

possible with the Deputy Attorney General. 4

MO BLE off -

The concept behind the establishment of this Proje
is to develop a capability of implementing requests received
from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and
timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct
its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible.

We believe that by creating this facility we will be able to
meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the
exception df the research that will have to be done in the
substantive Divisions.

While the Project will direct internal work and }
related liaison with the intelligence community and the i:
White House staff, we envision the Legal Analysis Unit Office -
of Legal Counsel Division as continuing to be the primary

point of direct contact with the Select Committees of the
Congress. They will receive all requests and deliver all
responses to these Committees. In addition, they will meet

with the staffs of the Committees to insure the reasonableness
of requests. If necessary, they will call upon the expertise

of the substantive Division for determination as to whether

a proposed request from the Committees can be responded to
within a reasonable period of time and within the icecilecaca

ambiguities requiring recontact with Committee staffs; the
assignment of research responsibilities to substantive Divisions;
following such responsibilities to insure timely responses;

as well as representing the FBI on the Executive Committee

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group for Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community. Assistant Director Jolin A. Mintz is
also a member of the Executive Committee. This latter responsi-
bility will provide Cregar and Mintz with direct liaison not
only with senior officials of the intelligence community but
also with the President's counsel.

Mr. Elmer W. Larson, Unit Chief, Training Unit, IS-3
Section, Intelligence Division will act as Cregar's Number One
Man; will administer the work of the Project; and act in the
absence of Cregar.

Seymor F. Phillips, Unit Chief, Civil Disorders
Reporting Unit, IS-1 Section, Intelligence Division will serve
as the Review Coordinator for the Project. His responsibilities
will be to review all research; coordinate all responses; be
available to consult with substantive Divisions as to proper
form of our responses; identify any conflicts in FBI positions
where several Divisions are responding to a particular question;
as well as to insure the quality, completeness and adequacy
of responses to Select Committees requests. Additionally,
Phillips will be responsible for the preparation of abstracts
to be furnished to the Interagency Registry maintained at CIA
Headquarters. This Registry established by the Executive Committee
of the Ad Hoc Group at the suggestion of and with the concurrence
of the White House will serve as the coordinating mechanism
for the entire intelligence community.

Mr. Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Officer with CIA, CI-4
Section, Intelligence Division will function as the Liaison
Officer with the intelligence community responsible for coordi-
nating and,clearing all information under the third agency rule
where FBI responses are of interest to or are of a proprietary
interest to other agencies of the intelligence community. Schwartz
will serve as the Bureau's representative on the Ad Hoc Coordinating
Group for Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

Because of the White House insistence that all requests
and responses be completely coordinated and available for review
by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project
have a self-sustained records facility to insure immediate access
to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select
Committees. In addition, in those instances where certain FBI
documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized
(excised), it is imperative this records facility not only retain
copies of the sanitized documents but also copies of the original
text. For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been
requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project.

In addition to the above, there will be stenographic
and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the
work of the Bureau Supervisors. We have not committed any more
personnel to the Project than are absolutely necessary at the
present time. Should the requests of the Select Committees
require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda will be
submitted with a complete justification for additional personnel
assigned to the Project.

Although the physical space for the Project is
limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75
will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This
space is physically located within the Intelligence Division.

As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter,
Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should
any member of the intelligence community get requests from other
Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence
community; could be of interest to the White House;or are of such
sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the
requests and an abstract of the responses should be made
available to the Interagency Registry.

ACTION:

For information and record purposes.

105, 107, Part I and Part I1,ani Section 130 are not being
furnished to the Committee, but the Committee will be allowed .
to examine these Sections at FBIHQ, Section 36, dealing with
espionage, although classified, does not contain sensitive
material involving sources and we feel in the spirit of the
requirement we should furnish this Section to the Committee,

As a matter of interest, all of the material with

“The Washington Post,” Thursday, 4-10-75, edition beasadecstoees

on page A381 contains an article reporting an interview of Senator Frank
Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
Senator Church, according to this article, stated that the Committee is
reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is ] f
accepting nothing with “strings attached.” oo { }

Inasmuch as this Committee is also the Committee which the
FBI is furnishing information tok, it is believed a clarification of Senator Church's
statement must be obtained and in the interim we should furnish the Senate
Select Committee only those documents which do not have a caveat such as
classified documents or documents bearing the property stamp.

Section Chief William O. Cregar advised that he had contacted

Dr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Committee
concerning Senator Church's reported statement. Clarke stated that CIA
Director William EH. Colby was highly upset at Church's remark and that
this statement would be a topic of a discussion of the Executive Committee meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review the morning of
4-11-75. We will be represented at that conference by Section Chief William O.
Cregar and Assistant Director John A. Mintz. Clarke indicated the position _
that the CIA will apparently take regarding this problem is that the White House
should obtain the clarification although CIA Director Colby initially was prepared
to dene a ee over his signature to Sena 1 to obtain such clarification. 7

As Inasmuch as the request EX Fins ‘Com: oe was forwarded throu:

Douglas Marvin, Assistant to the Attorney General, who has been handling

desire that he be advised of any aa response to the Committee Fhe OFRing 1915

Senate CIA Coniinittee Says
White House Stalls on Data

‘By George Lardner Jr.

‘Washington Post Statt Writer
The Senate Committee on|

Intelligence Operations dis-
closed yesterday that the
White House is still stalling|
on.a month-old request for|
the directives involving covert;
activities by the Central In-
telligence Agency and other|
arms of the Government,

Sen, Frank Church (D-|

{daho), the committee chair-
man, told reporters after a
closed, 2%-hour meeting that|
“he had been authorized to
write another letter to Pres-|
‘dent Ford asking him to ex-}
pedite the request,

The committee asked Mr.|
Ford on March. 12 for all the
executive orders and top-
secret National Security Coun-|
¢il directives concerning the
CIA and the rest of the in-|
telligence community, includ-
ing the command structure at
the White House.

The President was also
asked to supply the committee!
with a copy of CIA Director]
William E. Colby’s January|

' report to Mr. Ford on allega-
tions of illegal domestic spy-
ing by the agency.

But all the committee has)
gotten so far, Church said,
has been what the White
‘House evidently regards as
the least sensitive documents

-on the list,

Church said,he did not
know “what the hang-up is”|
since White House aides have,
indicated they consider the|
committee’s entire request as
“perfectly proper.”

Church did not spell out all}
of “the’ more sénsitive data”
that is still being withheld,
but he said it includes both
the Colby report and ‘the top-
secret White House and Na-
tional Security Council direc-
tives dealing with covert oper-
ations, Noth foreign and heal
mestic,

The Idaho senator said the
eommittee is reserving the|
right to make public eventu-
ally any documents it gets and
is accepting nothing with
“strings attached.” But he de
clined to speculate on whether
this might be the reason for|
the administration’s hesitance.

Church said all of the rec-
ords were essential to the
committee’s mandate to inves-
tigate the CIA and the rest of
the government's intelligence
community. He said he still
had.no reason to think at this'
point that the White House
would refuse to give them up,
put he emphasized that he saw
no reason for further delay.

Church.said the committee}
also authorized its staff of|
about 35 lawyers and investi-|
gators to start gathering evi-
dence and interviewing wit-|
nesses as the prelude to a pro-

jected round of public hear-
ings this summer. The House!
has also ordered a similar in-
quiry but its committee,
‘headed: by Rep. Lucien Nedzi
(D-Mich.), has yet to choose aj
staff director.

The Senate committee’s)
chief counsel, Fritz Schwarz,
said directors have now been|
named for ali four of its task
forces. They are William
Bader, head of the foreign in-
telligence task force;. John El-|
liff, head of the domestic in
telligence task force; Alton H.
Quanbeck, head of the Mili-}
tary intelligence task force,
and David Aaron, head of the
task force that will study the’
intelligence community’s|
‘command and control struc-
ture.”

Bader is a former Senate,
Foreign Relations Committee
aide and has recently been
working with the Ford Foun-
dation. Elliff is a Brandeis
University professor and ex-|
pert in domestic law enforce-
ment activities. Quanbeck has
been director of the Brookings:
Institution’s defense analysis
project and Aaron has served
on the National Security|
Council staff. .

Schwarz said that each’ of}
the task forces will cut across
the lines of various intelli-
gence agencies and focus on
general avenues of inquiry,
such as the “legal authority

and legal restraints” for intel-

ligence work; the targets and|:

techniques of  intelligence-|
gathering, counterintelligence
and covert operations, and the
question of who orders and|
controls those activities.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. Roderick Hills reported that he had a meeting
with the Counsel and Staff Director of the. Senate Select Com-
mittee (SSC) to discuss having Legal Counsel present when members

nel, The essence of this meeting resulted in the SSC being
receptive to such an arrangement but it would be incumbent upon
leach agency, department or bureau to negotiate the specific
arrangements for such representation with the SSC. Hills also
discussed the problem of the unknown employee or former employee
who might request to be interviewed unbeknownst to the parent
agency. It was suggested to the Counsel and Staff Director by
Hills that such an employee be interviewed by only one staff
member, that the staff member attempt to ial rg in nae,

Memorandum for Mr, Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

testimony of a secret employee and following such testimony
the employee will be allowed to meet with staff members of
the SSC in an Executive Session. It is anticipated more
definitive information on the final decisions regarding this
aspect will be forthcoming from the White House,

The question was raised by the Bureau representative
as to whether the Ad Hoc Group and/or the interagency registry
should be notified as to requests members of the Intelligence
Community receive from other Congressional committees. Mr.
Wilderotter advised that this would be a judgment question;
however, if a request from a Congressional committee other than
the Select Committees impacted on the Intelligence Community,
involve sensitive issues or would be of interest to the White
House, such requests should be provided to the interagency
registry along with an abstract of the response.

Attached is a list of those members of the SSC staff
who have been certified for access to compartmented information.
Also attached is a paper identifying 10 issues likely to grow
out of Select Committee deliberations. The pencil notation in
the right-hand column identifies those agencies of the Intelli-
gence Community responsible for preparing a paper which addresses
these issues. It is noted that issue identified as number eight
is entitled, "Intelligence Files and Privacy." Mr. Colby asked
that the FBI prepare this paper. Assistant Director Mintz advised
that the Bureau has a study underway on this very subject and
agreed that the Bureau would prepare this study. The deadline
for completion of the study is 4/25/75,

Also attached is a copy of the survey of the SSC facility,
Room G-308, Dirksen Building, covering all aspects of physical and
technical security. None of the participants of the EXCOM had any
objection to the facility and we presume the SSC will abide by
the procedures outlined in the attached survey report,

Vv
Attached also for information is a draft of an employee .
notice and agreement concerning treatment of confidential material
being considered by the SSC. It is to be noted that to date neither
the Committeenor its staff has signed any such Secrecy Agreement.

Senate Select Committee Facility
‘Dirksen Bldg. ist §& € eis aa) N. £.
Washington, D.C.

fa. In? response ‘to. a request from Mr.. Ben. Marshall, Security”
Director, Senate Select Committee, (tele. 224-1700). Messrs. :
Nicholas R.’ Zubon and Robert E. Burgener conducted a comprehensive
security survey of the Senate Select Committee's Facility on
24 March, 1975.

2.. Mr. Marshall provided both + a comprehensive ‘tour of the
facility and a detailed explanation of the operation.

3e The ‘following are pertinent facts ‘concerning the ‘security|
procedures as related to the Senate Select Committee Facility:

Ae Type of Facility

The Committee is in the ‘auditorium (Room G 308) of the Dirksen
: Building at, lst and C Streets, N. E., Washington, D. C. . Access to
the ‘auditorium is gained easiest by entering the building from the
ist and C Streets entrance. A 24-hour guard post is located just
inside this entrance.. The Select Committee facility is-40' east -
of the building guard post.: “It is nearly in direct line of sight,
“however, a foyer surrounded by a 6' high temporary partition pre-
cludes thé auditorium entrance door from being visible. The
entrance to the auditorium is protected by a ae hour. guard post.

: The ‘auditorium (Room G 308) is approximately’ 100°. ‘Long x 45"
wide. The floor, ceiling and walls are made of 6" to’ 8" solid
"masonry. The ceiling has.a false ceiling approximately’ 18" deep
in which the air handling equipment ‘and sundry other service ©
components are housed. . All major air handling equipment ‘is on
the roof above the ‘auditorium. Access to the roof which is strictly

controlled by the Director of Security, is gained by a stairway
-in the ‘southeast corner of the auditorium. The. sidewalls: each have
.a 2! x 3" register approximately. 12'. above the floor through which ~

_DocTd:32989628 Page 144



air is passed ‘from the auditorium to the air handling equip-
ment on the roof. These registers are solidly bolted into -
the walls. : :

The front of the auditorium (south wall) is covered by
a large movie screen. To the right and left of the movie ~
-screen are two rooms.6' wide and approximately.15' long used
by the.research section clerical personnel. These rooms - tees
have ‘countertop openings approximately 3" above the floor
for access from within the auditorium. Countertop openings -
exist along both sidewalls for approximately three quarters.
of the length of the wall. The sidewalls have intercorridors
on the opposite side of the countertops which have been con-
verted into unpartitioned office space.. The only reproduction
machine, a xerox model 3100, is located.in the west corridor.
The ‘east corridor has been converted into a compartmented Saanat
information storage room and a compartmented document reading +. _
room. The Security Director indicated that he may move his —
office to the head of the compartmented reading room to provide” .
a larger measure of access ‘control -to this sensitive area. '

The auditorium has six wooden exterior doors. 7 ‘high ‘and
. 3" thick. The entrance door into the auditorium (west and :
north wall) will have an.electrical push-button lock installed.
A similar door in. the east end of the north wall will be barred
and bracketed’on the inside to prevent unauthorized entry. . The’ e
west wall has 2 exterior doors leading into the Capitol Police :
offices. The east wall has two exterior doors with one leading
to the roof while the second door. exits into the Capitol Police
Garage. All exterior doors will be alarmed. The doors now :.
have Yale 197':1/4 locks with the keys controlled by Mr. Marshall.
The fire safety factor concerning these locked: doors was cata
‘ cussed with hin. :

The auditorium has a small second floor area at th north °
end. - Access is gained by two stairways on the east and we'st
side ‘of the auditorium. The second floor space consists of a
large projection room, currently filled with projection equip-
ment, and five ‘small. private film viewing rooms. _—

“The five small rooms will be converted into witness inter-
view rooms. The windows in each of these rooms will be covered
during the stay of the Select Committee in the auditorium.



NW 55118 .DocTa?.

“B. Access Controls

Access to the Dirksen Building is gained by eithex the
main entrance on ist and C Streets, ground level, or the
Basement Tunnel Entrance at the rear of the building. Both’
entrances have a 24-hour guard post where persons entering
are- checked for identification. Brief cases and packages

. are processed through x-ray machines.’ Vendors entering the ©

main entrance ‘are checked for ID, however, all boxes. ‘are not

. checked.

“Entry into the auditorium is controlled by a guard at the”

‘door. His instructions are that all persons entering must’ .

show an ID card. Visitors are permitted only by. appointment.: -
They are logged in.and escorted at all times while in the
auditorium. From 1800 hours Friday through 0800 hours Saturday,

and from 1300 hours Saturday to 0700 hours Monday. everyone ‘must’:

sign the ‘log in and out and show an ID. In the event an access
problem arises at the guard post, regardless of the hour, Mr.
Marshall.is alerted. - * EuEreen

C. ° Guards

The Dirksen Building and the auditorium are protected by
members of the U. S. Capitol Police Department. The Building
has two 24-hour/7day-a-week ‘guard posts at the entrances while ©
the Senate Select Committee has one 24- hour/7. ‘day-a-week ‘guard:
post at the entrance and an after-hours roving patrol inside
the auditorium. All police ‘officers are wel ained, wear
the Capitol Police uniform and carry Smith ‘ai

auditorium for classified material that may not have been
secured, and the second floor hourly during the night. The

_ guards on duty at the time of the survey were alert and

responsive to. their duties. During off-duty hours, guard
supervisors make ‘at least two unscheduled visits. to the guard

.posts during each shift. In addition the guard at the ?

stationary post has. four telephones, two of which have a pickup
and automatic ring feature with Capitol Police Headquarters.
There will be no rotation of police officers during the °
occupancy of the Committee. The same officers will be assigned
to these posts. poo :

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of
the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the
Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the morning of 4/2/75.

The study prepared for the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) entitled, "Human Intel~
ligence," has come to the attention of the Senate Select
Committee (SSC). The major contributors to this report were
the FBI and CIA. It is an extremely sensitive document and
for that reason any requests from any committees of the
Congress for copies of this report should be referred to the
White House. At the present time, the consensus of those
persons in the White House dealing with the subject of release
\33 information to the committees of Congress is that this

report will not be provided Congressional committees at this”
time. :

The SSC does recognize a requirement to comply with
the Third Agency Rule which states in effect that classified
information or material originating in one department shall a0
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it see
has been made available without the consent of the originating’
department, CIA's General Counsel has produced a paper entitled
"The Third Agency Rule," copy attached, which they have requested
be reviewed by the Legal Counsels of all agencies making up the
Intelligence Community. A copy of CIA's paper referred to above
has been made available to Assistant Director Mintz who has
indicated he will be in direct ree. + with Mr. Warner, CIA's

General Counsel. C- : e mam in Gh!

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

objections be furnished to the Security Committee of the

United States Intelligence Board (USIB) for consideration.

A copy of these guidelines has been furnished to the Freedom

of Information Unit of the Legal Counsel Division for review.
Their comments will be furnished to the Bureau's representative,
Mr. Frank Schwartz, on the USIB Committee in compliance with
the mandate from the Ad Hoc Group.

Also attached is a copy of the abstract which all
agencies of the Intelligence Community are being required to
use in abstracting information that agency has provided one
of the Select Committees, These abstracts will be retained
in an interagency registry to be available for review by any
members of the Intelligence Community as well as the White
House, The purpose of this interagency registry is to have
available in one location all information in abstract form
that members of the Intelligence Community have provided the
ssc.

Attached is a memorandum for- Mr. John Clarke, Chairman
of the Group, advising the names and titles of individuals on
Congressman Nedzi's staff or on the staff of the House Armed
Services Committee who have been approved for access to classi-
fied material, It is assumed that these persons will have
continuing close relations with Congressman Nedzi and may be
officially associated with the House Select Committee.

Also attached is a letter from Senator Church, Chairman
of the Select Committee, addressed to the President enclosing a
list of documents which the SSC is requesting from the White House.

The Third Agency Rule

As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was

included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.
Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense
information originating in another Department or agency" to an
agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the
consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep- |
tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority
of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authdrizes ~

the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-
gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate
dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where
appropriate, existing EcAnimiE and facilities".

2.

Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate

intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is

the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-
nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is ax, homogenous
product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the _

receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order
11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not
specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the
followirig controls: Sec..9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The
originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in
conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with
respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information
. and material, including those which presently relate to communications
i ed intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

. 4

In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order

11682, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security
Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-
fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This
“Udirective does not contain the term "third ageiicy rule" but does have
four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what
historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:

_DocId: 32989628

A.(2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to 2

security clearance, a person must have a need for access
to the particular classified information or material sought

( ie obligations. The deterM@hation of that neéd ~ =

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination
by Re! ent. ‘Except as otherwise provided by Section
102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50
U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating
in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any
other Department to which it has been made available

. without the consent of the originating Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive. Intelligence Information.
Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING =
NOTICE ~-- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND
METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any
manner outside authorized channels without the permission
of the originating Department and an assessment by the

- senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department
as to the potential risk to the national security and to the
intelligence sources and methods involved. .

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The
establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-
bution and protection of classified inférmation and material >
under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior i
approval of the head of a Department or his designee,

‘5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are
received from all members of the Intelligence Community a:
then disseminated to members of the community under the
authority of the DCI; Seeen

_ (b) ACIA intelligence report disseminated to the State
Department may not be sent by the State Department to
the Department of Commerce without the permission of the
CIA; ;aesECanaen Pe :

: 4 i ae
(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's ; \
Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or
to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,”
a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA
information should be referred to CIA for action so that
the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

NW,55118 DocId:32989628 Page 169



(ad) Ifthe Navy Department discusses ‘one of its operations
with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation
in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has
received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc—
tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part
of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would
not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate
intelligence. ; :

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Ad Hoc Group

SUBJECT: : ‘Handling of Third Agency |Matters in Response
: ; to Congressional Select Committees

1. As you are aware, Senator Church already has submitted
to me a long list of materials which he requests be provided to his
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities. He has submitted other lists to :
the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the White House. . It is
expected that other elements of the Intelligence Community iting
be inane from Sénator Church, “!

2. ‘The scope of ‘the investigation necessarily is going to
involve Third Agency |relationships to a considerable degree.

3. Inthe implementation of Executive Order 11652,
"Classification and Declassification of National Security Information -
and Material," the President directed the followins:

“"D, Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination
by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section 102
of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495,50 U.S.C.
403, classified information or material originating in one
Department shall not be disseminated outside any other’
Department to which it has been made available without the
consent of the originating department."

4, As eed Section 102 of the 1947 Act, the following

(3) To the extent recommended by the National Security
Council and approved by the President, such intelligence
of the departments and agencies of the Government, except
as hereinafter provided, relating to the national security, —

eps OS see
ba -G39S os



ee e r)

shall be open to the inspection of the Director of Central
Intelligence, and such intelligence as relates to the
national security and is possessed by such departments and
other agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter
provided, shall be made available to the Director of
Central Intelligence for correlation, evaluation and
dissemination: Provided, however, that upon the written
request of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall make available
to the Director of Central Intelligence such information -
for correlation, evaluation and dissemination as may be ©
essential to the national security." ‘ ci

5. If lam requested to provide certain materials and :
investigation indicates that the material asked for involves a document .
s; which originated within an organization other than the Intelligence - oa
, Community Staff or the Central Intelligence Agency, the requestor
will be asked to redirect his inquiry to the office of origin. .

: 6. It already i is Sue pee vers that the documentation -
being requested inevitably is going to include references to inter-
. relationships among various of the elements of the intelligence
. community, Clearing each and every such céléicuite with ¢
agency mentioned could manifestly be extremely consuming of time

and manpower. -

: 7. I propose the Ad Hoc Group agree on the following procedure. -
Where it appears that truly sensitive matters are involved, the ;
material will be sanitized by the agency concerned and a check will
be made with the appropriate’ “Third Agency organizations before
release.’ Where the reference concerns a Third Agency indirectly

, or is not considered sensitive and does not pose policy concerns, the
agency concerned may forward the material to the requesting Select
Committee without an item~by-item, mention-by-mention clearance
with Third Agencies. However, in all cases notification that such
material has been forwarded will be made to the central index and

NW 55118 DocId:32989628 Page 1972


all agencies alerted through that mechanism. Agencies will
designate on their submissions to the central index, the name and

telephone number of the releasing party.

8. Ad hoc members should be prepared to discuss and
come to some agreement on this matter at the next meeting.

1. Attached is a copy of a statement, "Guidelines for
Sanitizing Certain Documents Provided Select Committees"
“prepared by the Chairman, USIB Security Committee, for
consideration by the Ad Hoc Group. This step isa follow on to
.the understanding the DCI has with Senator Church that sanitization
of selective documents will be undertaken before the documents’
are released to the Committee. Similar understandings have been
discussed with House Staff as well,

2. Itis important that, to the extent ‘possible, all intelligence
. organizations follow generally the same sanitization guidelines.
Accordingly, the USIB. Ad Hoc Group should consider utilizing these
or similar guidelines within their respective organizations. ‘

3. If requested by the Chairman, the DCI will discuss
orally with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate and House
Select Committees the content of the sensitive USIB or CIA material saegers
excised from documents. Where appropriate, the DCI may discuss ° *
this sensitive material with the entire Select Committee. He
considers it essential that the written record provided to the
Committee staff not include such sensitive information for the
protection of intelligence sources and methods.

“by the perce Committee of certain sensitive aspects of intelligence

“activities and i the Senator t has expressed h his recognition ¢ of this taeda

“Included i in such matters are the identities of sensitive sources, the

‘material provided | to ‘the United States by cooperating foreign

intelligence ervices, the details of technical devices and systems

"Further, > ‘recognition should be given. a the need

NW 55138

2. One form of this. special consideration may include use
“of sanitization procedures to avoid the risk of exposing such matters
_ and at the same time satisfy the Select Committee's need for a full ©

"3. What May Be Sanitized . ee

While it is not possible to atiticipate all requirements which

may be levied by the Committees for Aocumentitf material and not

possibie to determine specifically what material should be excised’
“from these documents, the ‘following illustrations are ‘offered i in :

; certain likely categories. The criteria in all cases } should meet

the test mentioned above.,

4. “Collection of Intelligence

ao “@) The Committee will probably address the matter of how :

: intelligence « activities or methods have or may impinge upon individeal

: tights. Documents | supporting responses may be sanitized by removal :
ae “of identities ‘of pa sais and informants, covert personnel,
and contractual cover arrangements. A descriptive phrase may be ;

“substituted, ines, a foreign journalist, a political official in the

opposition party. No sanitization should be used in connection with

or association with a department or agency, does not remain teers
or for individuals whose present or future activities on behalf of the
department or agency do not require ‘that previous ¢ cover arrangements

remain secret.

(b) Some information may be required with respect to

: technical intelligence systems including cryptologic and communications —

activities and reconnaissance capabilities. Almost all of such bioeicactooe

“is currently handled i in compartmentation control channels under —

"various ‘codewords or : nicknames. No security threat i is perceived .

by release of these codenames or nicknames i in documents. Details 7
of the technical” systems involved, contractual arrangements, sanding

and/or names hs companies or consultants whose participation was

obtained under agreement of continued secrecy may be excised from ‘

“* documents. Any question on release of codeword. material should bi

referred to the Program Manager who in turn may consult with —

Director of Central Intelligence to ensure a consistent fees in
the community's sanitization procedure. While documentary samples
of intelligence obtained by technical means may be used in support of

verbal testimony, no raw product should be provided the Committees



-for retention. Lf absolutely required by the Committees, sanitization 7
of such raw product should be conducted to mask the degree of

technical capabilities.

By memorandum dated 3-20-75, you were advised of a Director See'y —
request received from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
The Intelligence Division requested that an attempt be made to modify portions
of the Committee's request.

Regarding Part I titled Legal Authorities, the Intelligence Division
pointed out that this particular request was wide-ranging and required a considerable
file review as it requested any memorandum discussing the legal authority of
the FBI to “(1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence
information, and (3) engage in counter -intelligence activities; together with
copies of all constitutional and statutory provisions, executive orders, presidential
directives, Attorney General opinions and memoranda, and any other materials
asserted as sources of such authority.” With regard to Part IM concerning the
FBI's administrative organization, they requested the identities by name of personnel
in the Intelligence Division, Unit Chief and above. This caused concern in the
Intelligence Division that there would be a needless proliferation of a list of
Bureau personnel working in this field which list, of course, would be of interest
to foreign intelligence sources. Vi Hid

On 4-1-75 Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly discussed i
these matters with William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee;
John T. Hlliff, who has been nominated to head the task force for the Committee
looking into FBI activities; F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select
Committee; and staff member Michael Epstein. They agreed to modify the request
in Part II to the extent that personnel in the Intelligence Division need not be.
identified by name below the level of Assistant Director in the organization chart |

to be furnished them pursuant to theix request of 3-19-75. They asked as an
alternative the Bureau prepare a list-dfpersonnel in the Intelligence Division down

to the level of Unit Chief with names inch led which they would have access to

review in Bureau space. REC.A7 Ld ol

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75
,

With regard to Part I relating to legal authorities, they stated
they were amenable to the Bureau furnishing them whatever documents they
have retrieved up to this time which have been recovered pursuant to their
request of 3-19-75 and that no additional detailed review need be conducted
until they review the aforementioned documents. At the end of their review
they will make any additional specific requests concerning this part of their
request. They also asked that in our response we furnish them copies of documents
listed on a three-page paper prepared by the staff of the Senate Select Committee,
a copy of which is attached.

Staff Director Miller requested that the Bureau expedite their
response to the Senate Select Committee's request as the first meeting of that
Committee is scheduled for \ Wednesday.,.4:%215,,.2nd he felt strongly that they
must have material that showed progress in their study of the FBI prior to that
time. Mr. Miller requested that, if necessary, the request be responded to in
a piecemeal basis and that the complete response does not necessarily have to
be made at one time.

It is suggested that we make available to this Committee as soon
as possible those documents which we have furnished the General Accounting
Office (GAO) which also fall within the 3-19-75 request of the Senate Select
Coramittee. In this regard staff members have advised they are in contact with
GAO auditors concerning the FBI.

By way of observations it is obvious that the staff members of
the Committee are well versed in Bureau policy and procedures. To this point
they have been cooperative and we should insure that we give a timely response
to their various requests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Intelligence Division advise whether modification
of the Senate Select Committee's request concerning legal authorities for
investigations and the modification of the table of organization of the Intelligence
Division are acceptable and, if so, expeditiously prepare the necessary response

to the Senate Select Committee. pe wy

(4) This material should be sent to the Deputy Attorney General
by letterhead memorandum, the first paragraph of which should specifically
identify the request, for review and subsequent transmittal to the Senate Selec’
Committee.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that all

committees be forwarded by letterhead memorandum through the Deputy i. 7
Attorney General to the requesting committee, and also that in selected insta: es
a property stamp or statement be affixed to certain documents limiting access
aa

shy

With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into 8
FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding ay
documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as requestg
such as the request of thé Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities
have been forwarded<fo this Bureau through the Department, it would appear ~y
logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional : a
committees, whether they be directed to the Department and/or the Bureau, N
(be be responded to through the Department. Such a procedure not only will mak
all our Tesponses consistent but will also give the Department an 7. S
review and approve documents being made available to Congress. 8x

In connection with our preparation of responses to requests the es
Congressional committees, it is suggested that all responses should be by
letterhead memorandum, the first paragraph of which should clearly describe’
the specific request which is being oh meat to in the letterhead an th

affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:

1. Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army3 and the OSI, Ic,
U.S. Air Forse will continue to function in accordance with the
provisions of Sections II, III, IV, and V. :

2. In addition thereto, the armed forces commander may take

' gteps to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the

_manner in which complete coverage will be obtained if martial law
is declared, Adequate liaison with the other subscribing agencies
will insure that the armed forces commander will have the henetit
of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the representatives
af the other ‘agencies. :

3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and
receive such information from the other three agencies as he may
desire and they may be able to furnish.

XI. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the
coverage furnished by each of the subscribimg agencies and any

_ additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake, When
the commander feels that more complete coverage is required, it
is recognized that he is autherized to augment the coverage with
such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his
jurisdicticn. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally
coming under the cegnizance of the other subscribing agencies,
the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority
from the Secretary of Defense. :

, TII. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations
have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces
commander, whenever any of the other services feel that such
a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken,
it should be so recommended. :

gations, Inspecter ¢ al, U.S, Air Force, with a view to
promoting tke closest possiblé cecperation and coordination
between the Field Services of these agencies agree that the
following rscommendations will be transmitted to their field

7 (a) Special Agents in Charge of the Federal Bureau of

- Investigation Divisicnal Offices, Military Intelligence Officers
of the pertinent Armies, District Officers of the Office of
Special Investigations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force, and
Naval District Intelligence Officers will maintain clesc pers
“Liaison between those offices and their representatives, including
a meeting of representatives of the four agencies, preferably the
officers in charge, at least twice per month, for the purpose of
discussing pending and contempiated investigative activities, and
any other subject necessary to insure that there is proper co~
ordination of their investigative work.

_

oe (b) The clese personai liaison to be maintained ‘
between representatives of the four agencies at all times should
insure that there is not duplication of effort in any field, and
_ that a preper coverage of the whole investigative field is main-
tained, Particular attention should be paid to avoiding any
duplication in connection with the use of informers.

(c) A distinction should be recognized between the
investigative interest of individual agencies and the coverage
interest. It is believed that ail four agencies should study,
from time to time, the-coverage of the investigative field in
order to insure that all channeis of interest and avenues of
information are adequately covered by at least one of the partici-
pating agencies. : : : 7 :

(a) Where there is doubt as to whether or not one of the

(e) Consideration should be given to the fact*that certain
classes of information are of general interest to the Military,
Naval, and Air Force Intelligence Services in connection with
’ background and knowledge “of espionage and sabotage organizations,
even though the Military, Navai, and Air Force Intelligence
Services may have no apparent direct investigative interest.

INVESTIGATIVE GUIDELINES
TITLE XI, ORGANIZED CRIFE CONTROL ACT OF 1970.
REGULATION OF EXPLOSIVES

1. General

Title XI of the captioned Taw amends Title 18, United
States Code, by adding a new chapter 40 with section numbers 841
through 848 governing the importation, manufacture, distribution
and storage of explosive materials and creating cartain Federal
offenses pertaining to the unlawful use of explosives. © Administration
of explosives regulation is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury
as is investigative jurisdiction over the unlawful acts proscribed
in section 842. Under authority contained in section 846 the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) have concurrent investigative jurisdic-
tion as to the remainder of chapter 40, i.e., the unlawful acts
proscribed in subsections (d), (e), (f), (a), (h) and (i) of section
84 Although not specified in chapter 40, the Postal Inspection

or directed against U.S. Postal Service property. -

Title XI greatly broadens Federal- authority pertaining to
explosives-connected offenses. At the same time, Congress has
expressly disclaimed any intent to occupy the field to the exclusion
of state law on the same subject matter. To effect both Congressional
purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is
essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carefully
allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATF and the FBI
have jurisdiction.

2. Federal Bureau of Investigation (F281) Jurisdiction in General

(a) Effect on prior jurisdiction - This agreement applies
only to those incidents as to which the FBI had no investigative
jurisdiction prior to the enactment of the captioned law and to
‘incidents previously subject to FBI investigation by reason of chapter
65, Title 18, United States Code (malicious mischief). Investigative
procedures in other types of incidents (e.g., train wrecking, damaging
aircraft and motor vehicles, racketeering) shall remain unchanged.

(b) Primary jurisdiction - Subject to the provisions
hereof, the FI will exercise primary jurisdiction over al] alleged
violations of section 844 which are directed at foreign diplomatic
facilities or at activities, such as transportation and tourist
offices, operating under the aegis of a foreign government although
not in a diplomatic status, over all alleged violations of subsections
844(d) through (i) which are perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionary
groups or individuals and all other violations of subsections 644{e)
through (g) which are not directed at Treasury Department or Postal

groups or individuals - The FSI will immediately initiate a full
investigation of all alleged violations of section 844 which appear
at the outset to have been perpetrated by terrorist/revolutionar:
yroups oF dividuals a5 defined in advance by the Intcrpal Secu

‘ Division of the Department of Justice. If ATF or the Postal
Inspection Service has properly initiated investigations and infor-
mation is subsequentiy developed indicating apparent involvement of
terrorist/revolutionary groups or tnidividuais, responsibility shall
be relinquished to the FBI unless a determination is made by the
Department of Justice that a transfer of responsibilities will

’ unduly impair further investigative efforts.

(2) Alleged offenses against Colleges and Universities -
The FBI will immediately initiate a full Investigation of any aleged
violation of section 844 which involves the use or attempted use of
explosive (as distinguished from incendiary) materials against the
facilities of a college or university. Investigation of alleged viola-
tions involving use or attempted use of incendiary materials will be
limited initially to the development of background information as
prescribed in paragraph 6 bélow.

(3) Alleged offenses directed against foreion
diplomatic facilities and related activities - The FSI will immediately
initiate a full investigation of all alleged violations of section 844
which are directed at foreign diplomatic facilities and related

844(f) -- offenses involving use of explosives against United

States property or federally financed organizations, and (4) ~
offenses involving possession of explosives in buildings owned,
leased, used, etc., by the United States ~ The FBI will immediately
jnitiate a full investigation of all violations of subsection &44(q)
over which it has primary jurisdiction hereunder, and those violations
of 844(f) which are directed at federal property (e.9., & military
Daal or a federal function (¢.g., a Selective Service or ROTC
facility). In other violations of 844(f) the FBI will develop and
disseminate background information as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

3. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division (ATF) Jurisdic-~
tion in General

(a) Violations ancillary to firearms laws violations or
violation of section 842 - The Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division
(ATF) Of the Department of the Treasury will exercise investigative
jurisdiction over violations of section 844 which are ancillary to its
primary jurisdiction over the Federal firearms laws or over section
842 of Title XI.

(b) Violations of subsection S44(d) - interstate transporta-
tion of explosives with unlawful intent and subsection Baa) =
offenses against property used in or affecting commerce - Subject to

Justice has requested FBI investigation in a particular matter.

(c) Violations directed at Treasury Department property or
functions - The ATF shall have primary jurisdiction to investigate all
violations of section 844 which are directed at Treasury Department
property or functions and will conduct a full investigation of such
violations. . - -

NW 55118 DocId:32989628 Page 224


-4-

4.. Postal Inspection Service Jurisdiction

The Postal Inspection Service shall have primary juris-
diction to investigate all violations of section 844 which are
directed at U.S. Postal Service property or functions.

5. Special Considerations

(a) Bomb Threats, false information (section 844(e)) -
The ATF and the Postal Inspection Service shall have jurisdiction
over violations of section 844(e) against Treasury Department or
Postal Service property or functions, respectively. The FBI shall
have jurisdiction over all other violations of section 844{e). Upon
receipt of information alleging or suggesting a violation of subsection
844(e), the investigative agency concerned will review available
information to determine whether the identity of the offender is
known or can be readily ascertained and, if not, whether the evidence
suggests a pattern or pian of such offenses by a particular uffemer
or against a particular victim. If such a pattern appears or if the
offender is identified, all available information will be disseminated
as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

(b) Use/carrying explosive in conmission of a felony.
(section 844(h)) - Violations of 844(h) should be handfed as an
adjunct of the felony from which they arise and should be discussed
with the appropriate United States Attorney or Division of the
Department handling prosecution of the underlying felony offense.
The agency having jurisdiction over the underlying felony will have
investigative jurisdiction over the 844(h) violation (e.g., bank
robbery is under FGI jurisdiction).

(c) Violations of 26 U.S.C. 5861 (destructive devices) -
In incidents involving alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. 844 (which
may also involve a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5861), ATF shall not
exercise its primary jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. 5861 involving
destructive devices, but the incident shall be treated in accordance.
with the provisions of these guidelines. This is in no way a
relinguishment by ATF of its investigative jurisdiction under Title
Il of the Gun Control Act of 1968,

55118 Docld:32989628 Page 222


aE Ae

6. Development of Background Information

Some incidents such as those directed against Federal
property or functions (paragraph 2(b) above) require immediate full
federal investigation. Others require a more circumspect approach
and will result in full Federal investigation only after considera-
tion of factors pertinent to the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.
Accordingly, in those incidents which these guidelines do not prescribe
immediate full investigation, the investigative agency having juris-
diction will develop background information which includes (a) facts
bearing on motivation such as involvement of the suspected perpetrators
in terrorist/revolutionary activities, organized crime, labor-management
disputes, or racial-religious hate activities; (b) the applicability
of state and local laws and likelihood of state or local investigative
and prosecutive actions; and (c) any other available facts indicating
whether or not the offense warrants Federal investigation and prosecu-
tion. Such background information will be submitted telephonically
(202-739-2745) or by teletype (710-822-6008) to the General Crines
Section nf the Criminal Division and to the appropriate United States

_ Atterney, The Criminal Division will advise the investigative agency
concerned whether the matter warrants submission to any other
Bivision or Section of the Criminal Division, and when so warranted
the Criminal Division wilt transmis the information to such other
Division or Section.

“7. Full Investigation

A full investigation will be initiated immediately in
those instances wherein such investigation is specified herein. In
other instances full investigation will be initiated only upon direc-
tion of the Department of Justice after consideration by the Division
having cognizance over the matter of the background information
developed under paragraph 6 above.

8. Reports i 7

Copies of case reports prepared in matters investigated under
these guidelines will be furnished directly to the Department of Justice
and the appropriate United States Attorney. All investigative agencies

NW 55118 DocId:32989628 Page 223


Se

shal] submit initial reports as soon as practicable to the Department
of Justice and shall submit progress reports once each 30 days or

as soon ‘thereafter as possible. The Criminal Division of the
Department of Justice will be informed as soon as possible in each
instance wherein an investigative agency initiates an investigation
under section 844. Such notification is of critical importance to
the avoidance of duplication of investigative activities. Also each
agency subscribing to these guidelines shall, upon instituting inves-
tigation regarding possible violations of section 844, immediately
notify other subscribing agencies having a logical interest therein.
Also, a sufficient level of follow-up liaison and dissemination shall
be maintained to avoid duplication of investigative effort.

Additionally, each such agency will exchange information
on a timely basis and in’a manner which will not interfere with
ongoing investigations relative to types, scurces, movement, and
storage of explosives which are the subject of its investigations.
Information regarding significant developments in investigations
being conducted under these guidelines and information of an intelli-

nonce natura deyeloved incidental te investigations +

at at
ich $3-af logical
interest to the Department of Justice shall be furnished promptly to
“~ the Criminal Division of that Department which will be responsible
for any necessary further ‘dissemination within that Department.

9. Review of Guidelines -

These guidelines shall be reviewed on a continuing basis by

_ the parties hereto to determine whether problems exist in their admin-

istration which should be alleviated or whether modification of any of
the terms of the agreement are needed in the interests of better law

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES
** SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 6

"AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND THE UNITED STATES
SECRET SERVICE CONCERNING PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES

("i. Purpose of Agreement

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) originates, and receives from
other sources, large numbers of reports on individuals and organizations.
One purpose of this agreement is to define that portion of the information
on file with, or received or originated by, the FBI, which the United States

7 Secret Service (USSS) desires to receive in connection with its protective
responsibilities.

"The USSS has statutory authority to protect, or to engage in certain
activities to protect, the President and certain other persons. (Certain
other persons, as used in this agreement, refers to those persons protected
by the Secret Service under Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056.) ‘The
authority of the USSS to protect the President or certain other persons is
construed to authorize it to investigate organizations or individuals and to
interview individuals who might constitute a threat to the President or cer-~
tain other persons. The FBI has statutory authority to investigate assault,

| killing or kidnaping and attempts or conspiracies to kill or kidnap the
President and other designated individuals.

HM "The FBI will make available to the USSS information at a reg)

, matiod which vy its nature reveals a definite or possible threa
. safety of the President and certain other persons. i

* "A second purpose of this agreement is to iasure the most effective pro-
~~ tection for the Presideut and certain other persons by establishing a clear
« division of responsibility between the FBI and the USSS. Such division

will also avoid compromising investigations or sources and needless duplica~
i tion of effort.

4 "IIs General Responsibilities
}

| "The USSS is charged by Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 3056, with the
| responsibility of protecting the person of the President of the United
_ / States, the members of his immediate family, the President-elect, the Vice
“* President or other officer in the order of succession to the office of
‘President, and the Vice President-elect; protecting the person of a former
‘President and his wife during his lifetime and the person of a widow of a
: former President until her death or remarriage, and minor children of a former
1 President until they reach 16 years of age, unless such protection is declined; ~
protecting persons who are determined from time to time by the Secretary
of the Treasury, after consuttation with the Advisory Committee, as being
major Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates who should receive such -
protection (unless the candidate has declined such protection); protecting
, the person of a*visiting head of a foreign state or foreign government
. and, at the direction of the President, other distinguished foreign visitors
to the United States and official representatives of the United States
/ performing oF missions abroad (unless such persons decline protection).

throwing or destroying the Government of the United States, or the Govern-
ment of any state, territory, or possession, or political subdivision
therein, by force or violence, or by the assassination of any officer of

individuals or organizations as requested. During investigation by the FBI
of such individuals or organizations, the FBI will be alert and promptly
notify the USSS of any information indicating a possible plot against the
person of the President and certain other persons.

groups identified or suspected of being threats to the internal security of
the United States without notifying the FBI. However, when time for

The statement in the attached of pattie Ag

As an observati: aragraph number 7 of the
document titled "Handling o&Lhird Agency Matters in Response to
Congressional Seléct Committee" dated March 28, 1975, (attached)
appears to be subject to various interpretations. This paragraph and
in particular the second sentence of the paragraph appears to allow the
-agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where a
a Third Agency is indirectly involved and thé material is sensitive with- a
out first contacting the Third Agency. Any notification of the Third
Agency in this instance of the furnishing of such information to the
Committee would be after the fact. The term indirectly is not defined.
Additionally, this paragraph allows the Agency receiving the Committee's
request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is directly involved
and the material is nonsensitive without checking with the Third Agency
involved. It would appear the language in paragraph number 7 should

be tightened up and the appropriate terms defined. i 7

The Third Agency Rule © ~

_ 1, As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was
included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.
Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense
information originating in another Department or agency” to an
“agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the :- .
consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep- |
tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority
of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This Section authdrizes ~
the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli- 9 i=
gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate
dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where
appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the pet to dissetiinate :
intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is :
-the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-
nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is af homogenous
product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the °
receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agence, T=

3. Executive ‘Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order
11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order didnot.
specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the .
following controls: Sec..9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The
originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in
conformity with the provision’ of this order, special requirements with
respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information
and material, including those which presently relate to communications

: pentane intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

; t : “4 In anticipation of the implementation of { Executive Order
: ‘11652, a directive was issvied on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security .

7 Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi- ~
fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This
“directive does not contain the term "third ageijcy rule" but does have
four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what
historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are: |

A.(2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition +.

shall be made by officials having responsibility for the
classified information or material. :

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination
by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section
102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50

tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part
of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would 7
not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate

intelligence. . a Hs .

INTELLIGENCE..ACTIVITIES'
HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC) suas eat

By agreement, the FBI is currently conducting full field

investigations regarding SSC staff personnel. These have extrenely &\

short (2 week) deadlines which are identical to those afforded
Presidential appointments and are, therefore, given preferential
treatment in opening, assigning, and following field progress. The
Special Inquiry Unit of the Employees Security and Special Inquiry
Section, which has about twice its normal case load, is handling
these requests. Senator Church, Chairman, SSC, originally estimates”
that between 35 and 40 staff members would be submitted for investig |
gation. As of today, 4-3-75, we have received requests for 65 suchG
investigations from the SSC and the end does not appear to be in 8
sight. They are received in bunches as many as 6 at a time, which g
is not the even flow expected and presents an additional burdenj—

In addition it is expected that similar requests wipite-
forthcoming in the near future from the HSC since we have a si ar
agreement with it. Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the HSC, fas
estimated "probably no more than about 25 staff members will be
hired.” It remains to be seen if this estimate also falls short of
actual receipts.

Since there is no charge for these full field investigatid
they will have to be considered in the budget. It is noted the
current charge for a mlb 1d ma mani where applicable, is |
$2028, ita

ACTION: For information. Since it appears the nucleus of the
Committee has been formed, it is suggested sen ftGe" crareimsescon-
tacted and queried regarding a more realistic (30 day) deadline on
the remaining investigations concerning future Bta?B héniBtrs and
their replacements.

This memorandum recommends thatthe attached
draft of a paper prepared by CIA entitled, Ambiguities and
the Law," be réviewed by the Legal Counsel Division for comment
and that a member of the Division be named to represent the FBI
in future meetings with legal representatives from other U. S.
Intelligence Board (USIB) agencies and departments. The purpose
of such a group is to develop recommendations for changes in
existing laws or the proposal of new legislation which Mr. Colby
as the Director of Central Intelligence can offer to the Senate
Select Committee for their consideration.

fot.
At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on a ng
Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community 2/27/75, a‘ "~
draft paper entitled, "Ainbiguities and the Law," was distributed

to all members, This paper was drafted by Mr. Marvin Smith of

CIA. It is considered a starting point for the Intelligence
Community to identify areas in existing statutes that should be
changed, as well as to recommend new legislation deemed necessary
to clarify for the Congress and the American people the authori-
ties, the limitations and missions of various member agencies

or departments of the Intelligence Community,

In furnishing copies of this paper to members, the
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, Mr. John Clarke, acknowledged the
paper presents a starting point and in no way should be considered
a final draft. He suggested that Legal Counsel representatives
of each agency or department of USIB review the document and
submit their comments directly to Mr. Marvin Smith, on Agency
code 143, extension 4055. Following the receipt of such comments
from the legal offices of member'' agencies and departments, it
was proposed that a meeting would be called in an effort to ~
begin drafting a paper representative of the Intelligence Community
which would reflect recommended changes in existing statutes or
proposals for new legislation, exe oie

AMBIGUITIES AND THE LAW

CIA, NSA, ae FBI and, to some extent, several other: "*
Federal Agencies, collect information and produce intelligence, but
of different kinds and for different purposes. This is recognized in
practice but is not as clearly established in the law. Given some
lack of clarity in the law and some uncertainty regarding limits
placed on intelligence activities, misunderstanding and fear of abuse
of power easily thriveX. In reality, however, in the implementation
of mission and charters and in direction and control, “there are not
as many unresolved ambiguities as the uninformed may suppose.

The experience following the National Security Act of 1947 is
such that it is now possible to eliminate some of the vagueness of
the language of the Act. The certainty and public confidence that
should result from clarifications in the law should far outweigh any ©
disadvantages. A number of possible amendments or additions to
current laws have already been mentioned, and proposed legislation

has already been submitted for some. These ideas and others are

suggested, below.

i232

1) Clarify CIA's mission and charter by
amending the National Security Act of 1947 to ~
reflect:

--that included in the proper functions

of the Agency are (a) collection of foreign
intelligence information; (b) conduct of
activities to carry out CIA's counter-
intelligence responsibilities overseas;
and (c) conduct of covert action pee Eee

overseas when authorized by the President;

--that CIA's responsibility to produce
intelligence relates only to foreign
intelligence;

--that it is a duty ‘of the Agency to develop
advanced technical equipment to improve
.the collection and processing of foreign

intelligence information; and

| NW 55118 Docld:32989626 Page 250



~-that the conduct of any counterintelligence

operation or other activity overseas directed
specifically at U.S. citizens (other than CIA
*employees) will be undertaken in coordination
with the FBI or as requested by the FBI or by

other USG agencies in coordination with the FBI.

4

2) Establish thé authority for those agencies engaged
in the collection and production of foreign intelligence to
earry on certain specified activities within the United

States, such as:

--protection of classified information and : sauce
their own installations against penetration

and compromise; ** ops

.~-investigation of employees, applicants,
and those persons who could assist the Us,

foreign intelligence effort;

NW 55118 Docld:32989628 Page 251



--investigation of employees and other
individuals to be granted access to. sensitive

information;

--collection of foreign intelligence
‘information from foreign nationals and.

from cooperating U.S. citizens;

--establishment of mechanisms in support

of foreign intelligence activities; and

~-cooperation with the FBI in investigations
relating to the uriauthorized disclosure of

foreign intelligence.

3) Remove uncertainty regarding responsibility for

‘internal security matters by modifying appropriate laws to

establish clearly:

55118 Doclda:32989628

--that the collection of counterintelligence
information in the United States and the
collection of information related to internal

security are functions of the FBI;

Page 252



--that the responsibility for the
production of intelligence related to ~
inte mal security rests with the FBI; and
--that with due regard to assessed
reliability of the information and
responsibilities for protecting sources
and methods, those agencies engaged in
foreign intelligence activities will make —
available to the FBI and other Federal
agencies, as appropriate, the security
and counterintelligence information relating
to foreign nationals in the United States and
to U.S. citizens which is derived as a by-

product of foreign intelligence activities.

ne

4) Recognize international terrorism and international

illegal drug activities as threats to U.S, national security ~

” and proper targets for U.S. foreign intelligence efforts,

as wellas for internal security operations.

disclosure of intelligence sources and methods by: .. ate
--providing for the protection of intelligence
sources and methods on a statutory basis

independent of Executive Order 11652;

--clarifying that the Director of Centrak
Intelligence is responsible for protecting
intelligence Sources and methods related

to foreign intelligence and foreign

é counterintelligence;

--assigning to the Director of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation the duty of protecting

intelligence sources and methods related to

internal security and to counterintelligence

within the United States; oS

' --imposing specific burdens, upon officers
and employees of all branches of the gowern-
ment and others granted official access, not

to disclose such information without autthorization,

NW5118 Docld:32989628 Page 254


and providing criminal sanctions for unauthorized

- ae

disclosures;

-~establishing effective injunctive recourse,
through the Attorney General, for protection

of all intelligence sources and methods;

--providing for in camera judicial review
of materidl revealing intelligence sources

and methods when relevant and necessary

to criminal and civil proceedings;

: : ; ~-delineating authorities and responsibilities.
for investigating suspected ‘or discovered
unauthorized disclosures by (a) U.S, citizens
overseas and (b) all persons within the

ye

United States. ~ .

6) Delineate areas of interagency assistance that
facilitate performance of authorized missions, promote
- economy of resources, and as a matter of policy are

desirable, for example:

| NW 55118 Docld:32989628 Page 255



-8-

~-cooperation in research and development

of technical collection and information pro-

cessing equipment, methods and techniques;

--loan or supply of equipment, methods and
:

techniques;

--provision of training in special skills and

techniques; -

--passage of information derived as a by-
product of foreign intelligence activities to
those agencies responsible for the matters

involved.

A few changes in the procedures for reviewing intelligence
activities might add considerable’ understanding and confidence. Of
paramount importance is a form of congressional oversight that permits
the provision to Congress of the necessary information in a timely,
efficient and controlled manner. It is recognized that a number of
Committees in both the Senate and House must be informed of sub-

stantive intelligence, operational matters and fiscal details in varying

degrees. Just as in the executive branch, the test of access should be

NW 55118 Docld:32989628 Page 256

fa


"need-to-know."' To apply this test and to control and protect
sensitive information provided to Congress, a focal point within .,.
Congress would be extremely helpfal. Whether a joint committee
or not, such a focal point would also be valuable in facilitating
changes in laws affecting intelligence activities. Congress might
:

find that a more uniform approach to budget presentation and review
would provide better insight and understanding.

The foregoing suggestions are by no means definitive. They

+

do, however, present areas that in the experience of the intelligence

community deserve careful attention. 7

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

BUDGET AND ACCOUNTING SECTION

RE BUTEL, MARCH 24 LAST.

LOS ANGELES DIVISION HAS CAREFULLY BROKEN DOWN BY PERCENTAGES
THOSE AGENTS WORKING INTERNAL SECURITY AND COUNTER- INTELLIGENCE
WORK USING THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS PROVIDED BY SUPERVISOR GROOVER.
DIVISION HAS A TOTAL OF 91 AGENTS PLUS ONE SAC, FOUR SUPERVISORS
ASSIGNED TO INTERNAL SECURITY AND ONE SUPERVISOR ASSIGNED TO
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, ASSIGNED TO SUCH CLASSIFICATIONS, THIRTY
FIVE OF THESE WORK COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND 56 WORK INTERNAL SECURITY.

ADMINISTRATIVE

LOS ANGELES IS SUBMITTING FOR BUREAU’S CONSIDERATION, IF
PERTINENT. THREE OF THE ABOVE 56 CLASSIFIED AS SECURITY AGENTS
WORK FULL TIME ON BOMBING MATTERS WHICH ARE ALMOST ALL MATTERS
WHEREIN WE HAVE NO JURISDICTION EXCEPT FOR DATA KEEPING FOR
NATIONAL BOMB DATA CENTER. TWELVE OF THE 56 SECURITY AGENTS

NW 55118 DoclId:32989628 Page 337

ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN OUR FALSE IDENTITY PROGRAM. THIS 12,

PROGRAM ORIGINATED WITH OUR WEATHFUG ACTIVITIES, HOWEVER, 7
tL

THE FRAUDULENT USE OF DECEASED INFANT IDENTITY PAPERS HAS 23

EXPANDED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY INVOLVE
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN SECURITY WORK. SEVEN OF THE 56
AGENTS ON SECURITY ARE INVOLVED FULL TIME IN FUGITIVE
INVESTIGATIONS WHICH ORIGINATE WITH SOME DEMONSTRATION OR

ACT OF TERROR, ETC, BUT AT THE PRESENT THEY ARE CLEAR CUT
CRIMINAL FUGITIVE INVESTIGATIONS. ONE OF THE 56 IS INVOLVED
FULL TIME IN THE HANDLING OF FOREIGN POLICE COOPERATION
MATTERS WHICH IS TECHNICALLY AN APPLICANT-TYPE INVESTIGATION,
BUT THE 163 CLASSIFICATION WAS INCLUDED IN THE SECURITY
CLASSIFICATIONS. CSUMMARIZING THESE EXCEPTIONS WE HAVE A TOTAL
OF 23 AGENTS WHO ARE ASSIGNED TO SECURITY WORK BUT ARE, IN
FACT, NOT INVOLVED IN ANY INTERNAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS,
LEAVING ONLY 33 AGENTS DEVOTING THEIR FULL TIME EFFORTS TO
INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS PLUS, THE ABOVE MENTIONED 35
COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AGENTS.

Memorandum captioned as above, “3/27/75, from Legal
Counsel to you, noted that you and Wannall were to meet with
Mr. Hills and Mr. Phillip Buchen, Counsel to the President,
on 3/28/75. Your addendum to the memorandum pointed out the
results of this meeting and the various matters discussed.

As a follow-up to this meeting, you, Legal Counsel
Mintz and Wannall met on 4/4/75 with Mr, James Wilderotter,
who is presently working under Mr. Buchen in coordinating
intelligence community matters relating to the inquiries
underway by the Senate Select Committee. Mr. Wilderotter was ()
given a briefing similar to that which had been afforded to —
Buchen and Hills. In addition, the discussion covered matters _f.
of a sensitive nature relating to the JORCHID] and similar programsy——
electronic surveillances, specialized handTing of informants,
and Bureau Source 4 (access to social security records), Many of
these matters discussed covered topics with which Mr, Wilderotter
had become familiar when he was assigned to the Department as an
Assistant to former Deputy Attorney General Silberman.

y Wilderotter said it was the feeling at The White House
that while raw FBI files should not be made available to the
Committee, it might be necessary to permit the Committee to review
a few such files in order that the integrity of the FBI could be
established with the C, ittee. It was pointed out to him that
we did not agree to t that we could furnish summaries of

material from the Files My Wy laerotter said,he did” jot feel tbat eS y

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
RE: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES;
RODERICK H EI SassociatTe
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT

furnishing reports and letterhead memoranda which had been
prepared for dissemination would satisfy the Committee's
needs. He was advised by both you and Mr. Mintz that it was
our feeling that we should not furnish the raw material but
summaries could be prepared for the Committee's purposes and
if necessary, Bureau officials could be placed under oath
and attest to the correctness of the summaries. Wilderotter
said that this was a matter which he would afford further
consideration.

As during the conference with Buchen and Hills,
it was obvious as the result of our meeting with Wilderotter
that The White House was most anxious that it not be caught
by surprise by revelations of activities which in any way
might be considered questionable. The White House is making
every effort possible to become cognizant of any such situation
prior to the Committee hearings.

Classified “Xp Secret" to protect highly sensitive
investigative techniqu and matters relating to foreign
relations.

For information. Further contacts with Wilderotter
or other White House Staff Members will be duly reported.

aa it
Gy On 3-18-75 Professor Jolin T,. Elliff advised Inspector John B. NU
Hotis that he had-been contacted by wiles agiler , Staff Director for the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, and was asked to serve
“as Director of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. This
is one of four Task Forces being formed by the Select Committee and it
will focus primarily on the activities of the FBI. The other Task Forces
are on Foreign Intelligence, Military and Technological Intelligence, and
Command and Control. :

Elliff said he had not decided whether to accept the offer
and believed that others were also being considered for the position. He
said he was reluctant to do anything that would interfere with the excellent
working sxrargemants he had developed with the Bureau. He feels that his
initial obligation is to the Director, and the purpose of going to the Police
Foundation was to get formal support for a project that would be of primary
benefit to the Bureau and only secondarily to the Attorney General and Congress’
He said he would be guided by our judgment in this matter and not want to .
break any commitments that he might have made with the Bureau. gb gz

If he accepts the appointment Elliff said he would, of course,
suspend work on his research project until he had terminated his employment
with the Committee. He said he would also agree not to use any classified
material that he acquired in his capacity as Task Force Director. Elli
has discussed this matter with John Heaphy, Assistant Director of the Police
Foundation. Heaphy said the Foundation had no objections whatsoever tor
his accepting the position with the Senate Select Committee, and he would
be free to,resume his projgct after the Committee work, was done...

” Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
RE: JOHN T. ELLIFE

It should be noted that the Select Committee considered
offering the position to LarrjyBaskir, Counsel to the President's Clemency
_Board.. Mr. Baskir formerly Served as Chief Counsel to Senator Ervin's
Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and we had numerous contacts
(\.. with him in that capacity. Our purpose was to reach some common agreement
by on privacy legislation that Senator Ervin planned to introduce in the 93rd
Session of Congress. There were numerous meetings with Baskir on the
sanre subject in the Deputy Attorney General's office. These efforts proved
unsuccessful and after several months we discontinued the discussions.
In our opinion, Mr. Baskir was unwilling to worl out apy reasonable
compromise and seemed unsympathetic to the pera earsaton concerns of law
enforcement.

It is clear that this is a matter for Professor Hlliff to
determine and the Bureau should not express an official opinion. Although
we have not always agreed with his views on intelligence matters, we
have had no occasion to question his objectivity or his integrity as a scholar.
Mr. Miller knows that Professor Elliff enjoys our confidence and it is
our understanding that he offered Elliff the position in order to avoid an
adversary relationship between the Bureau and the Committee.

Professor Ellift said he would make no commitments to
the Senate Committee until he hears from us.

RECOMMENDATION: {
That Professor Elliff be advised that it would be inappropriate

for us to express an opinion on whether he should accept the appointment
offered by the Senate Select Committee. \

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting
of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of a)
the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the sated
Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the afternoon of 3/25/75.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role
as the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were
Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President; the then Deputy A
AG Laurence Silberman, Associate Deputy AG James Wilderotter; Ay
Mr. John Clarke, as well as officials from Defense, Treasury F
National Security Council, Office of Management and Budget,
and the Energy Research and Development Administration.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director of the Senate
Select Committee (SSC), and the Committee's Counsel, Mr. F.A.0O.
Schwarz, III, visited CIA Headquarters to discuss SSC business.
Mr. Miller suggested that a tactic the SSC was considering is
the identification of several key issues that the Committee
could look into in-depth. For example, the SSC might propose
to identify two or three covert actions engaged in by CIA and
examine them in-depth rather than try to cover each and every
covert action CIA might identify. Colby advised that this
appeared to be an encouraging development and possibly each
agency of the Intelligence Community might be asked to provide
a series of key issues from which the Select Committee could =
select one or two for an vie al 4 E |
bd [lo 3957 fi

The question MW ssc oR Signing a Séerety
Agreement is still not settled. The Staff Director raised
some constitutional questions regarding the Secrecy Agreement,
Mr. Schwarz admitted, however, that some type of arrangement==>
would have to be made to insure that the Intelligence Community
had some protection against unauthorized disclostrdding-sustt
members of the SSC,

Memorandum for Mr, Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Both Miller and Schwarz accepted the Third Agency

Rule and agreed to abide by it. For the record, the SSC's

interpretation of the Third Agency Rule (which is consistent

with the Intelligence Community) is as follows: Classified
information or material originating in one department shall
not be disseminated outside any other department to which it
has been made available without the consent of the originating
department.

The Security Committee of the United States Intelli-
gence Board (USIB) will meet to develop some ground rules and
standardization for sanitizing documents to be furnished to
the Select Committees.

The question of Intelligence Community personnel being
represented by counsel was discussed. The position of the White
House on this issue has been fully reported in a memorandum from
the Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, dated 3/27/75, entitled "Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, Rodney Hills
Associate Counsel to the President."

It was also agreed at the meeting of 3/25/75 that the
President's Counsél would attempt to negotiate with the SSC to
insure that all interviews of Intelligence Community personnel
would be conducted on the premises of the bureau, agency or
department employing the persons to be interviewed.

Attached also for the record are the following:

A letter dated 3/20/75 from Staff Director William G.
Miller to Mr. John Clarke advising that Mr. Ben ialsunata has been
designated as the Security Officer of the SSC;

A letter dated 3/17/75 from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke
listing employees of the SSC who have been cleared by the
Committee for certification by CIA for access to classified
information up to and including "Top Secret";

A letter from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke dated 3/20/75

advising that Mr. Ben Marshall was cleared for access to
classified information up to and including "Top Secret";

21 March 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Ad Hoc Group of USIB on
Congressional Review

SUBJECT : Security - Arrangements for Receipt of Classified
Material by Senate Select Committee

1, On 19 March 1975 I telephonically inquired of Mr. Benjamin C.
Marshall, Security Officer of the Senate Select Committee, whether he
was in a position to begin receiving classified documents, He advised
that arrangements had been perfected and that effective 20 March 1975
such documents could be delivered as follows:

The courier should enter the Ist and C Street entrance
of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, inquire of the guard as
to the location of Room G308, go to the front door of G308,
advise the guard there that material is being delivered and
have him call Mr. Marshall or Charity Benz, both of whom
are authorized to receive classified documents up to and
including TOP SECRET*, :

2, Mr. Marshall requested that prior to delivery he or someone
in his office be telephonically advised (224-1700) of the impending
delivery and the estimated time of arrival so that he or someone from
his office can be available. He also stated that if delivery was desired
to a specific staff member, Mr. Marshall would try and have such
person available, but stated he was authorized to accept documents
for members of the Committee and staff.

3. The Committee has not yet advised as to compartmented
clearances but Mr. Marshall has been designated Compartmentation

* Mr, Patrick Shea is expected to be added as a person to receive
documents but the certification for this access to classified material
