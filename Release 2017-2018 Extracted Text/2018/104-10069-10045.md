2. We then had FAINBERG make contact with GREJBINA for the ostensible
purpose of interviewing her about this celebration. GRJEBINA gave him an
appointment on 14 May. However, she telephoned FAINBERG in the morning of

the llth and, claiming to be too busy, asked him to get the desired inforaa-
tion direotly from the man who was responsible for arranging the event, the
Soviet Consul Boris Feodorovich KAZAKOV (201-255600), telephone WAGram 14:03
(the number of the Soviet Consulate). FAINBERG telephoned KAZAKOV two days
later, identified himself as being from AEEGGHEAD/B and told him that GRJEBINA
had suggested that he contact him direotly to get some information about the
Planned commemorative event for publication in AERGGHEAD/B. KAZAKOV was very
polite to FAINBERG and invited him to cowe to his office at 1430 on 18 May.
When FA: G gained admittance to the Consulate at the appointed hour (which
ig not open for normal business in the afternoons), he was told by an un-
identified Soviet about 25-30 years old who opened the door that KAZAKOV had bee
called to the Embassy and had not left any word about an appointment with ~
FAINBERG. FAINBERG gave his card to the young Soviet and asked that KAZAKOV
call him. Later in the afternoon, FAINBERG tried te reach KAZAKOV on the
telephons, but there was no’ answer. KAZAKOV never oalled back.

3. The event toek place on 22 May 1966. It is best described in the
official invitation, a translatien ef which follew

Dear citizen,

‘The Consular Section of the Embassy of the USSR in
France and the Honorary Committee of Russian artists in ©
France invites youto » Commemorative Bvening of Soviet
Citizens which is dedicated to the 2lst anniversary of
the end of the Great Fatherland War and Victory over
Hitlerite Germany.

The event, will take place on Sunday, 22 May 1966,
et 20 hours, in the "Mutualite" hall (24, Rue Saint-Victor,

Paris 5).
The evening's program:
1. Commemorative part

2. Concert by Soviet artists and by Russian
artists residing in France. |

‘THE EMBASSY OF THS USSR IN FRANCE

| 4, A handsomely printed program brochure prominently listed the nembers
of the Committee of Honor which consisted of 14 French personalities of Russian
origin, most of whom man active in the arts. Among others, there was:ERASLAVSKY
President of the "Federal Union of Voluntary Units ef Fereign Origin in the
Resistance Army" (whom we noted in 1965 to have been a contact of AEDIGIT-1),
GRJEBINA, and - mich to FAINBERG's surprise - Lev ARONSON.

5. We had FAINBERG contact ARONSON to find out why he appeared on the
honorary committee and to attempt to elicit any information regarding ths nature
of this relationship with KAZAKOV. FAINBERG had a suitable pretext since 2
ABEGGHEAD was planning to do - and did- an editorial condemning this event as
@ Soviet propaganda effort. ‘FAINBERG visited ARONSON on 1 June, and this is
what he learned from him: .

QNTINUATION OF ‘GUAsIrICATIOg
DISPATCH Sz a

b) | GRIEBINA brought KAZAKOV to ARONSON's restaurant for lunsh,
and they asked ARONSON to serve on the honorary committee, ARONSON refused
because he felt that the 22 May event seemed to have Political overtones.
KAZAKOV aooepted his refusal, although he denied any politice: Propaganda
eenpones. jowever, ARONSON did promise to collaborate with Andee BARSACQ, @
Rember of the committes, on an article about Russian art in the emigration, and
KAZAKOV was grateful for the offer. ARONSON remarked that BARSACQ wrote the
srtisle, ARONSON translated it, but it was not printed in the official program
as planned,

0) Several days after KAZAKOV's vielt to his restaurant, ARONSON
socoupanied his brother-in-law to the Soviet Consulate where the lattes wanted
fo obtain an extension of his Soviet exit visa. ‘They were not received by

‘OV but by (Sergey Alekseyevich) LOKTEYEV (201-348434) who told them in

Substance the followings "We do not extend the visa for @nyone. You want

t we mest you halfway, but you do not want do do the same, and there te
thon T7K that your sister is getting ready to visit you." ARONSON understood:
this to be a not too subtle allusion to his refusal to serve on the committee,
apd then agreed to do as KAZAKOV had asked him to do. After that. his Drethen,
phrlew’s visa was extended. He told FAINBERG that he was not very proud of
bimself to have given in to his blackmail, and that it troubled nm greatly,
‘or the life-of his sister, i

@) ARONSON said that the original instigatorfof all this had
ce} ing teacher at the Russian Conservato;

6) ARONSQN desoribed KAZAKOV as @ "nice" and well educated
person He was ® pilot during World War II and is a "Hero of the Soviet
Union." He was on a short visit to Moscow to partioipate in the VE. Day
celebrations on 8:/9 May 1966.

1) PAINBERG prouised ARONSON that he would see to it that his
name would be kept out of the ABEGQHEAD/B article oritioizing the partioipetion
of emigres in the 22 May event, which it was. ARONSON was very grateful aca
offered in turn to be of assistance to FAINEERG. ‘The latter then asked
ARONSON to keep him posted of visiting Russian artists who come to hia resteurant|
in order that ABEGGHEAD/B could be passed out to them. ARONSON promised that he
would do everything that he could, even offering to introduce FAINBERG per-
sonaljy if this would help him in.his ABRGGHEAD/B propaganda effort.

3. A copy of the program brochure and the Soviet Embassy invitation card
ia! attached herewith.

4. Station Comment:

&) Our interest in ARONSON 1s predicated on the fact that the
"Dominique" restaurant is generally known to be frequented by visiting Soviet
artists - ARONSON himself has a theatrical background - aa also Eas Loos
Soviets may frequent it. For example Deputy Chief of the Commero: ssion
Aldesey hastolyevion MALYSHEV (201-254801) indicated to Richard C. BASESCU that
he Iknew the owner of the "Dominique" restaurant personally (OFPA-77690, 16

Dedember 1964).

b) We are there fore planning to have FAINBERG make the attempt

to develop ARONSON as an unwitting source, keeping in mind, offourse, that someore
may| be trying te put the shoe on the other foot. ‘This is an example of the type
of operational utility of FAINBERG when he uses his AELEDGER cover functiens

properly.
