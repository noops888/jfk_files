tactics of pressure and blackmail although, In this Instance, not for the

2. We then had FAINBBRG make contaot with CREJBINA for the ostensible

purpose of Interviewing her about this celebration.

GRUEBINA gave hin an

appointment on 14 May.

However, she telephoned FAINBERG In the morning of

the l4th and, claiming to be too busy, asked him to get the desired Informa-

tion directly from the man who was responsible for arranging the event,

Soviet Consul Boris Feodorovich KAZAKOV (201-255600), telephone WAGram 14:03

(the number of the Soviet Consulate). FAINBERG telephoned KAZAKOV two days

later, identified himself as being from AREGGHEAD/B and told him that GRUEBINA

had suggested that he contaot him directly to get some information about the

planned commemorative event for publication in AERAGHEAD/B.

polite to FAINBERO and invitod him to come to his office at 1430 on 18 May.

When FAINBERG gained admittanco to the Consulate at the appointod hour (whioh

18 not open for normal business in the afternoons), he was told by an un-

1dentifled Soviet about 25-30 yearg old who opened the door that KAZAKOV had bee

oalled to the Embassy and had not left any word about an appointment with

FAINBERG.

FAINBERG gave his card to the young Soviet and asked that KAZAKOV

oall him. Later in the afternoon, FAINBERG tried to reach KAZAKOV on the

telophone, but there was no' answer. KAZAKOV never oalled back.

The event took place on 22 May 1966. It In best described in the

official Invitation, & translation of which follows:

Dear oltised,

The Consular Seotion of the Embassy of the USSR in

France and the Honorary Committee of Russian artista In

France Invites you to & Commemorative livening of Soviet

dedicated to the 2lst anniversary of

• the end of the Great Fatherland War and Victory over

Hitlerite Germany.

Ine event will take place on sunday,

22 May 1966,

at 20 hours, in the "Mutualite" hall (24, Rue Saint-Viotor,

Paris 5).

The evening's program:

1. Commemorative part

2. Concort by Soviet artists and by Russiar

artlats residing In France:

THE EMBASSY OF THS USSR IN FRANCE

A handsonely printed program brochure prominently listed the nembers

of the Committee of Honor which consisted of 14 French personallties of Russian

origin; most of whom m aotive In the arts. Among others, there wasr ERASLAVSKY

President of the

"Federal Union of Voluntary Units of Fereign Origin in the

Resistance Army" (whom we noted in 1965 to have been a controt of AEDIGIT-1),

URBINA, and - much to FAINBERG's surprise - Lev ARONSON.

We had FAINBERG contact ARONSON to find out why he appeared on the

honorary committee and to attempt to elloit any Information regarding the nature .

of this relationship with KAZAKOV.

FAINBERG had a suitable pretext since

AREGGURAD was planning to do - and did an editorial condemning this event as

a Soviot propaganda effort. PAINBERG Vialtod ARONSON on I June, and th18 18

b) GREBINA brought KAZAKOV to ARONSON's restaurant for lunch,

and they asked ARONSON to serve on the honerary committee.

ARONSON refused

beonuse he felt that the 22 May event seemed to have politioal overtones.

KAZAKOV acooptod his refusal, although he denied any political propaganda

ригровея.

However, ARONSON did promise to collaborate with Andre BARSACQ, a

membor of the comittee, on an artiole about Russian art in the emigration, and

KAZAKOV was grateful for the offer.

ARONSON remarked that BARSACQ irote the

artiole, ARONSON translated 1t, but 1t was not printed in the official program

as planned.

o) Soveral days after KAZAKOV's vimit to his restaurant, ARONSON

nocompanted his brother-In-lan to the Soviet Consulate where the latter wanted

to obtain an extension of his Soviet exit visa.

They were not received by

KAZAKOV but by (Sergey Alekseyevich) LOKLEYEV (201-348434) who told them in

aubatance the following:

"We do not extend the vima for anyone.

You want

that we meet you halfway, but you do not want do do the same,

and there 1s

oven talk that your sister in gotting roady to visit you."

ARONSON understood

this to be s not too subtle allumion to his refusal to serve on the committee,

and then agreed to do as KAZAKOV had asked him to do. After that his brother-

1n-Jaw's visa was extended. He told FAINBIRG that he was not very proud of

L2.? himself to have given in to his blaoknall, and that 1t troubled him groatly,

A copy of the program broohure and the Soviet Embassy Invitation card

1s attached herowith.

4. Station Comment:

a) Our Interest In ARONSON is prodioated on the faot that tho

"Dominique" rostaurant is generally known to be frequented by visiting Soviet

artists - ARONSON himself has a theatrical background - and also because 10081

Soviets may frequent 1t.

For example Deputy Chief of the Commeroial Mission

Aleksey Anatolyevich MALYSHEV (201-254801) Indionted to Riohard C.

BASESCU that

he knew the owner of the "Dominique" restaurant personally (OPPA-77690, 16

Dedember 1964).

We are there fore planning to have FAINBERG make the attempt

to develop ARONSON as an unwitting source, keeping In mind, osbourse, that someone

may bo trying to put the shoe on the other foot.

This 18 an example of the type

of operational utility of FAINBERG when he uses hia ABLEDGER cover funotions
