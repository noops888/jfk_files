Dear Mike:

During the March meeting of the Photographic and Forensic Pathology

meetings, I requested that a detailed listing of minor and major repairs

and inspections of the trunk area of the Presidential limousine (done

after the assassination) be provided.

The listing (which is returned herein) predates the assassination by two

years and cannot be of use. My interest continues in the post-assassination

inspections, cleanup and repairs of the trunk-spare tire area.

Please

provide the records, if available.

sincerely,

Tom
