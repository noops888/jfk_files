INTERVicw’ AND MEETING SUMMARY Page lof 2

Conversation with VICTOR MARCHETTI on June 6, 1975 ours

Attendees: SELECT COMMITTEE: Senator Schweiker by
Elliot. Maxwell “th

I met with Victor and Senator Schweiker for approximately one
hour and a half. Victor made the following points.

1. It was not unlikely that People would have failed to tell
Director MeCone about certain actions. He came into the Agency
with a mandate from JFK to change it and announced that he was
going to fire a number of people (Vietor thinks that it was be-
tween 300 and 500.) ‘This ang the fact that he was an outsider
created a great deal of hostility, Given this there mignt be
back-channeling by people in DDO.

2. We might fing out what MeCone knew by asking Pat Carter who
was his deputy. or Lyman Kirkpatrick who was then Executive-Dir_
ector—Controller. Kirkpatrick left when Admiral Raborn was made

in the Agency were very concerned when they found out that he was

writing a book. He did submit it and they were able to negotiate

changes in it, (We might want to check to see if the origins of

the Kirkpatrick-Helms dispute were in the early days of the OPC
Oso)

3. In the area of assassinations,
assassinations which took place whi

Suggested that in many cases, agents we:
as a "local option", He thought that J:
any of these Options were taken,

In addition to the assassinations we were already looking at,
he felt that we might look at the assassination of General Sehneidkr
in Chile,

4. In regard to project MHMUTUAL he raised several questions.
These included:

(a) Where dig the money come from (the retirement fund, the
loan fund, credit union, escrow funds) ;

(©) On what basis Were decisions made to invest it (was
material from the research done for cover used or was information
derived from foreign intelligence gathering used).

He suggested that two former Ppp officials, Bryan Engel
(Eagle?) now in the White House Office of Telecommmications and
Frank Walters » who might stil? be at CIA might be knowledgable
about MHMUTUAL, He also Suggested talking to Jom Clark who sat
