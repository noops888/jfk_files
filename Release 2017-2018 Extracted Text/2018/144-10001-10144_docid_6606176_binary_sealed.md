MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: 8 November Meeting with Mr. Blakey

1.

On 8 November, Ed Sapp visited Mr. Robert G. Blakey,

Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the House Select Committee

on Assassinations, to receive questions concerning a former

Air Force enlisted man's allegation that he had intercepted

information linking an assassination plot against President Kennedy

with a figure in organized crime.

Mr. Blakey had been referred to

NSA (GC, Dan Silver) by Ms. Judy Miller, Special Assistant to

John Kester, OSD.

2.

Mr. Blakey indicated that David F: Christensen had

communicated with a friend of his named Sgt Michael B. Stevensen

at "Corry" Field, Florida.

Mr. Christensen has been committed to

a mental institution due, he asserts, to pressures arising from

an

incident occurring in 1963.

3. At that time, Christensen was in the Air Force assigned

to Kirknewton, Scotland.

Sometime before November, 1963, in his

work as an interceptor of

communications,

he intercepted the communications referred in paragraph 1. Mr. Blakey

stated that he did not know who the crime figure is. Christensen's

supervisor, Sgt Praeter (actually "Prater") refused to send this

traffic to NSA and this, he alleges, eventually caused him to have

a mental breakdown.

Mr. Blakey stated that NSA had already acknowledged the

existence of such a facility during this period, but he didn't

indicate to whom such a statement had been made.

5. Mr. Blakey posed the following questions for NSA:

(a) What is NSA's capability for retrieving communications

from this time and place?

(b)

How quickly can we make this retrieval?

(His Committee completes its work in December.

If

NSA can easily provide the answers to a number of

questions, he will do some preliminary investigation

before formally requesting the information, but if

we indicate that much time will be required, he will

task us now.

(c) What additional information does NSA need from Mr.

Blakey to speed the retrieval process?

(d) Is the data

still available for retrieval?

(e) Was Christensen really employed by the Air Force,

working for Praeter (Prater), and actually doing this kind of work

at that location during that period?

6. He asked for the responses, or at least, a status of what

can be provided and how soon, by Monday, 13 November.

7. On 7 September, the General Counsel sent a copy of David

Christensen's letter to the FBI (GC/335/78), along with

from An security service (to which sgt stevensen had sent the letter).

In the General Counsel's letter he noted that Security Service was

intercepting

I communications..at Kirknewton

in 1963 and that links between

were monitored.

8. On 9 November, Ed and I met with Dan Silver and decided

Dan should respond initially to Mr. Blakey's questions by phone.

After coordinating with EXEC/DDO, Ed asked G9 to provide input

for a

response.

9. Harold Parrish (5649) of G809 condish * an initial review

of the availability of data from USA-SS covering the first eleven

months of 1963.

From a computer file listing maintained by N3, 20 boxes

of data were identified.

Cross-checking assures that this is all and

the contents column helped eliminate 17 of the boxes.

The remaining

three wil be manually reviewed on 13 November. If they, in fact, do

contain traffic there will be some 2000 sheets per box.
