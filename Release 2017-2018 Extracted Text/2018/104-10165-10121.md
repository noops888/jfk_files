1. It is especially desired to cormend the OSS units that were ettached.

to or serred in conjurction with this headquarters and those Chinese A-nies

and groups whose operations were coordinated tarough this beadquarters with

the Chinese Supreme Zeadquarters.

& The varied and unusual tyce of duty performed by these units made

their perforance of duty most difficult.

In spite of the belief of reny

foreigners, based upon ordinary heirs reports that the Chinese were fizished

guerilla fighters of long experiesce in such operations against the Japanese,

thore was ectually little of

this type of coabat that had been carried on

effectively for the gast tro jears.

3. The arrival of aggressive and competent groups of officers, magy

with prior comando

service in the Buropean Theater, prorided a great impetus

to the chinese.

These young officers, with little or no prior service in

China, vere eble to obtair the coridence of the Chinese entirely beccaso of

their ilitary efficiency and ability to teach and produce results ard to

fight alongside of the Chinese i= neir units.

The cormardo units overcame

many disficulties ard produced outstanding results during their service

in Chira®

This hoadquerters has coordinated most of its work zith these units

through Colorel Williar R. Peers, Colonel William P. Davis,

and It. Colonel

Alfred T. Cox.

All three of these officers have proven to be especially

competent, cooperative, and cutstarding for cormon sense and judgerent.

Because cf their efforts, many co tho difficulties wich are inherent in

coordineting nilitary operations rhich arc removed from the channel of

military command have nover evo" arisen.

25th & E STREETS, N.W.

WASHINGTON 25, 0E

12 July 1946

SUBJECT: Captain Lucien Coseia

TO

8 Mr, Richard Felns

1. Reference is nade to your reuisition dated la June 1946,

requesting a Liaison and coricting Officer for inzon.

Such request

was made by Lleutenant Colonel Inbler, Executive Officer. Furtter

reference is nade to corres-enderce fru jolonel lubler dated 19

June 1946, under mich he suggests that captain Lucien Conein

presently assigned as less and Club Officer, be detailed to fill the

above request.

2. Captain Conein was reassigned to Amzon at tbe insistence

of high echelon Har Departsent authorities.

Then serving his first

tour of duty in ETO, Captain Conein becate involved with the daughter

of the editor of one of the leading De Ga-llist publications. The

matter apparently was a sericus one for jen Captain Conein was

eturned to the United States, rench officials contacted United States

Corerument autrorities i= Sachington, ealling to thair attention the

relationship which had previesly existed between Sagsain Coneir. and

the aforementioned girl.

Recasse of this situation, sul was directed

to return Captain Conein in an Inocuous position to sto for the pur

poses of settling nis persoral affairs vita tre aforementioned girl.

3. The suggestion of Colorel Kubler that Captain Conein be used

as Liaison and Conductirg Officer has been thoroughly discussed in

Personel Branch and with Security Branck.

It is their unaninous

opinion that the choice of Jartain Conein to I11l this resuisition

would be unise.

Because of his past history of persoral relationships

with high French officials, and because of the fact that Captain Conein

18 supposed to cceupy an inconspicuous position, it is deened aivisable

that be remain in his presen: position axi not be transferred to a

position where he night subject the organization to criticism and

censure.
