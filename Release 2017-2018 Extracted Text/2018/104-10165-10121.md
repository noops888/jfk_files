1. It 1s especially desired to commend the OSS units that were ettached .
to or served in-conjutetion with this headquerters and tuese Chinese Amies
and groups whose operations were ecerdinated through this Leadquarters with
the Chinese Supreme Headquarters.

2. The veried ex4 unusual type of duty performed by these units sade
their performance of duty most difficult. in telief of reny
foreigners, cased upon ordinary news reports thet the ished
guerilla fighters of long experiecce in such operations against the Jepenese,
there wes ectually little of this type of canbst that tad been carried on
effectively for the pest tuo years. . a wee

3. The arrivel of aggressive and competent sroups of officers, sany
with prior comendo service in the Buropean Theater, provided a great impetus
to the Chinese. These young officers, with little or so prior service in
China, were edle to obtain tke confidence of the Chinese entirely beccuso of
their silitery efficiency and ability to teack and preduce results end to
fight elo=gside of the Chinese iz their units, The cormamio'units overcane
many difficulties ard produced outstanding results during their service
in Chine. : : Emer

- 4. This hoadquerters has coordinated nost of its work with these units
through Colonel Willian R. Peers, Colonel Willien P. Davis, and Lt. Colonel
Alfred T. Cox. All three of these officers have yroven to te especially’
conpetent, cooperative, and cutstanding for cormion sense and judgment. :
Because cf their efforts, many cf the difficulties which are inheront in
coordineting military operaticns which arc recoved from the channel of
military cormend have never ever erisen.

SUBJECT: Captain Lucien Conein

TO 2 Mre Richard Felzs

1, Reference is nade to your regzsition dated kh June 1946, :
requesting a Liaison and Cor.ducting Officer for amzon. Such request ‘
was made by Lieutenant Colovel Fubler, tive Officer, Further
reference is made to corres-caderce fruz colonel Kubler dated 19

i dune 1916, under wiich he suggests that Captain Lucien Conein
i presently assigned as Mess and Club Officer, be detailed to fil) the
above request. fi Fi

: 2. Captain Conein was reassigned to Amzon at the insistence

i of high echelon War Departzent authorities. When serving his first

i tour of duty in ETO, Captain Conein becare involved with the daughter

: - of the editor of one of tne leading De Gacllist publications. The
matter apparently was a sericus one for xxen Captain Conein was
returned to the United States, “rench officials contacted United States
Goverment authorities ix Eashington, calling to their attentica the i t
relationship which had previously existed between Captain Conein and

the aforementioned girl. 2ecause of this situation, SsU was directed

to return Captain Conein in an innocuous position to STC for the pure

poses of settling ais persoral affairs with the aforenentioned girl.

3. The suggestion of Colonel Kubler that Captain Conein be used
as Tdaison and Concuctirg Officer has been thoroughly discussed in
Personnel Branch and with Security Branch. It is their uanizous

. Opinion that the choice of Tartain Conein to fill this recuisition
would be unwise. Because of Lis past history of versoral relationships
with high French officials, and because of the fact that Captain Conein

H
i =
i is supposed to occupy an inco-spicuous position, it is deezed acvisable &
t that he remain in his present position ani not be transferred to a ¥
H position where he aight subject the organization to criticism and &
