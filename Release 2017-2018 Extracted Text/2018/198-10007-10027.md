MEMORANDUM FOR MR, CALIFANO

SUBJECT: Refugee Handling

This paper, prepared by HEW, points up the problems of
refugee handling and recommends that only one plane pef,be authorized
in the event flights are resumed. This recommendation is based upon
the ability of HEW to handle that number of refugees through an expanded
resettlement program (previously two or three planes per day. were
arriving).

There is no direct involvement of the Department of Defense
in this program, The major. issues are as follows:

a. The diddtomy of syphoning off resistance forces
versus the normal U, S. assistance to refugees.

b. “The aiddtomy of assimilating refugees versus their
desire to be ready to return to a "new'' Cuba.

c The problem of establishing an additional refugee
center to take the burdens off of schools, housing, municipal
services, employment, medical and health and community
relations in the Miami area (the pros and cons ofthe establish-
ment of a second center are outlined in the enclosure to. the
paper).

There are intelligence and security implications in the estab-
lishment of a second center which are not fully reflected in the enclosure.
I suggest you.take your lead from CIA and Justice on intelligence and
security matters (Defense could be involved if we were required to estab-
lish a second screening point, however, this is of lesser importance).

: There is no indication that HEW or Labor have sought assistance
from private institutions other than those presently operating in the Miami
area which include one Catholic organization, one Protestant organization
and one interminational organization.

NW 50955 DocId:32424020 Page 2


CAUTION:

Although it-is not our business, suggest that care be exercised
in your placing your stamp of approval on any program which restricts
the. inflow of refugees as this is against our fundamental principles.

Many of the problems are essentially economic and political
and we would do best to be listeners rather than givers.

Type of Refugees on Red Cross Flights

1. From 18 Jan - 1 Feb 63 we have had five Red Cross flights~
arriving in Miami from Cuba carrying "US a: tionsls.” Presumably
official Washington believes that these people are in truth hardship
cases, of US nationals who were prevented from leaving Cuba before
this date, In reality the passengers reflect more Cuben nationals
than US, and represent to a very large degree Cuban nationals
arriving in the US on the coat-~tails of minor children who vere
born in the US. The specific figures for the month of January
are 276 Cuban nationals and 217 US nationals, There were 196
children.

2. The Miami Field Office has been covering all Red Cross
flights at the airport, and has interviewed all male adults, The
results have been extremely poor, based on a large degree on the
very low caliber of the individuals who are coming in. Appended
is a memorandum prepared by concerning the type of
refugees who are arriving, and we think it is completely accurate
based on our own observations while covering these flights,

3, While we do not believe that we have any influence over
continuance of Red Cross flights, we do feel that we should register
our Opinion concerning the type of individuals who are being permit-
ted entry into the US under the guise of being US nationais ead
hardship cases.

4 mentions a number of mentally deficient, This

has been quite true of the passengers on board the Shirley Lykes and
the African Pilot. The Biscayne Boulevard Office within the Taet
week has Interviéwed three individuals who had been confined in
mental hospitals prior to their departure for the US. I encountered
a fourth case on a recent Red Cross flight. Castro is obvicugly

MEMORANDUM

TO : Justin F. Gleichauf

FROM 3

SUBJECT: Type of Cuban Refugees Arriving

1, It seems obvious that the Cuban Government
is utilizing the Red Cross transportation facilities
to foist off on the US great number of undesirables.
As has been well documented in reports secured from
the arrivals theaselves, (and the newspapers), the
majority of the passengers on the "African Pilot"
and the "Shirley Lykes" had little or no connection
with the Invasion Prisoners. At the most, the "good"
ones could ascribe their departure from Cuba to the
fact that they had property the Cuban Government
wanted. At the worst, the “bad" ones would appear
te be Castro agents, Communists, nationalists, cri-
minals and physically disabled.

2. The arrivals on the Red Cross plane of 25
Jan 63 were just about the dregs of Cuban society.
The passengers made accusations against their fel-
tow passengers, and from the reports secured from
individuals, it was apparent that many of them were
would be Castristas, neophyte Communists, or genuine
Castro agents.

3, The arrivals on the plane of 1 Feb 63 were
the worst collection of human beings it has ever
been my misfortune to view. There were four or
five honest hardship cases of very old persons.
There were some who were obviously physical wrecks,
there were a number of mentally deficient, and there
were some who were obviously seriously ill with
disease. In addition te those there were extremely
low class people, there were almost illiterate negroes,
and there were self admitted Fidelistas, and Nacional-
A had Ui


4, These people are not, in my mind, genuine
refugees. They are (1) cast-offs of the Cuban
seciety, (2) arrogant Castro agents, or (3) people
so devoid of political conviction that they could
awe no allegiance to any country.

5. The wave of indignation experienced by the
Immigration and Customs Inspectors is most revealing.
These men, veterans of long years of experience in
dealing with all types of humanity, have reached the
point where they make open statements that "such trash
should never be admitted to the US," and before I
go on admitting people like this, I'll take my re-
tirement."

8. Somehow, something should bs done to cail
the attention of Washington to this most sorry state
of affairs. Thia sovereign nation should say when
peopie will enter this nation, and should also say who
should enter this nation, regardless of how much the
do-gooders howl about “humanitarianisa."” It is my
opinion that until facilities are again set up
properly to screen these arrivals at Opa-Locka, no
more refugees should be allowed to come to the US,

7. ‘The other members of the Miami Field Office
Staff are in full ‘accord with these recommendations.

POSITION PAPER IN REGARD TO THE HANDLING OF CUBAN REFUGEES
IF FLIGHTS WERE TO BE RESUMED

Question: WHAT SHOULD, THE UNITED STATES DO: TO HANDLE THE ASSIMILATION,
TEMPORARY ‘OR PERMANENT, OF CUBAN REFUGEES ARRIVING AT THE
RATE OF 400 TO. 500 A DAY?

The answer to this question must’ be considered from the standpoint of
two alternative assumptions:

(1) Continuation of the entry. of ‘the refugees into Miami:with no
provision for immediate mandatory Government directed movement
hon (not resettlement in the strict sense of ‘the word) to other
areas; or

(2) Initial entry into other areas of the United States directly
: from Cuba or by Government directed movement from Miami
immediately after arrival.

Weré daily arrivals into Miami to be resumed but at.an increased rate “~
of from 400 to 500.a day with no provision for immediate mandatory Government ©
directed movement elsewhere, an intolerable situation would develop in Miami
because social, economic, and health facilities of that city are already
overburdened by the existing Cuban refugee population.

. During the calendar year 1962, approximately 82,000: refugees registered
: at the Miami Center and about 35,000/were resettled, leaving a net gain in the’
refugee population in Miami of 47,000 persons. There is an estimated 100,000

: plus Cuban refugees now living in Miami'who are severely taxing the total facilities

of the area.

Arrivals at the rate of 400 to 500 a day, or 146,000. to 182,500 a year,
i is a 75% to 120% increase over 1962,° Assuming that we were successful in
increasing the resettlement figure to 52,000 persons per year, the increase in
the Cuban refugee population in Miami’ would be between 94,000 and 130,000 a
years Accordingly, if the 400 to 500 daily arrivals were to begin on
March 1, 1963, Miami's refugee population would approach, or be in excess of,
200,000 by March 1, 1964. This would. have an extremely heavy impact upon the
total economy of Miami and would exceed by far. its ability to provide necessary

Examples of problems which would be created are:

1. Housing. This would probably be one of the areas of greatest impact.
Exact statistics are lacking, but what follows sums up prevailing conditions in.
Miami. About one-half of the 100,000 refugee population live near the central
Miami city region. One-quarter are in other sections of the city and the

removed from it. Recent surveys indicate that while there are no real slum
conditions as yet, there is already considerable over-crowding in refugee
ewellings.

HW 50955 DocId:32424020 Page 17

housing, educational, social, health, and other facilities required by the refugees.

remaining one-quarter reside in county regions adjacent to the city or considerably

Housing will be further complicated by area re-development and expressway I
construction already underway in Miami which will eliminate housing currently } I
used by Negroes. An unestimated number of refugees will also be affected. i
There is every likelihood that Negroes will penetrate the fringes of the so-called t
"Cuban" areas in search of housing and that both elements will become 3 |
competitors seeking: low-cost housing. The result will be to add to existing |
real or imagined economic dislocation of both Negroes and the refugees with the }
inevitable local public opinion supporting the local Negroes. 7 i

2. School facilities. The public schools presently accommodate about “At }
18,000 refugee children. The parochial system has about 5,000, The capacity P
of the latter has been at the overflow level for some time. The public school: |
system is also at the point where its facilities are being stretched to the <= oF
utmost. Use of portable buildings, double shifting, and "bussing" of refugee.

children to other areas already exist.

i
Under the impact of the 1962 net increase in Miami's refugee population

of 47,000 persons, the public school's refugee child load-rose from about 11,000 '

at the start of 1962 to about 18,000 by the end of the year. If one applies the i

1962 ratio of 150 students for each 1,000 rise in the refugee population’ to the i

estimated net increase in the population (were arrivals to reach 400 to 500 per i

day), the public school system would have to absorb at least another 14,000

students by March 1, 1964. This would give them a total refugee child school

registration of at least 32,000 which is far in excess of available or

anticipated facilities, 4

who have full or part-time employment in the Miami area. However, with about
100,000 refugees in the area~-60,000 of whom are receiving assistance--it is
reasonable to assume that 15,000 heads. of refugee families have jobs of some
kind. Despite the lack of solid data, it is’safe to assume that refugee F
employees have dislodged others, particularly Negroes, from former jobs. : ;

|

fe U,
32 Employment. There are no solid figures for the number of refugees i aan
I

A net population increase (as computed previously) of at least 94,000
refugees would probably add at least another 30,000 potential job seekers in
Miami who would be competing with other refugees and larger numbers of
indigenous Negroes and whites. Total unemployment in Miami is already high-~ ~
currently estimated at about 12% to 14%, *

Miami does not have an industrially-based economy, New plants are coming
into the area, but they will also attract skilled labor from. other parts of the.
nation. There is no foreseeable time when Miami's economy will be able to
absorb its present native and refugee employables.

4. Municipal services such as police, fire, sanitation, etc. No effort
is made here to calculate the impact upon these facilities of the already
existing or hypothetical refugee population in Miami. But it seems quite i vf
obvious that there will be a heavy impact which would require substantial " ft
expansion of services. Federal financial support would undoubtedly be sought © Fe
for this purpose,

HW 50955 DocId:32424020 Page 18


@ — @

Medical and health facilities. The primary source of these services
for refugees at present is the Miami Center's medical dispensary and cooperating
hospitals, The dispensary will be working to full or over-capacity even with.
the planned increase in staff and facilities in terms of the present refugee
population. Out-patient, in-patient facilities at county and private hospitals
are also severely taxed by the current refugee population level. A 100% increase
in the refugee population would add an unsupportable quantitative load to the
Center's dispensary and outside facilities, Over 1,200 patients are now being
treated each week at the Center dispensary and another 300 to 400 are treated at
the hospitals.

6. Community relations. Difficult to assess--although not an acute
problem at this time--it is doubtful that public officials or the general
population in Miami and Dade County would accept.without serious complaint a
renewed refugee influx of the magnitude proposed by the question. . A 100%
increase in the refugee population would obviously add to current economic and
social problems and create increased hostility. toward the Cubans.

The HEY Cuban Refugee Center is currently planning an- organized community
relations project to assuage the resentment that now exists--based on real but
mostly exaggerated situations. We seriously question whether any community
‘relations program could successfully cope with .the impact in-Miami of an annual
increase of 100,000 additional ‘Cuban refugees.

General Observations: If the refugee influx goes to 400 to 500 persons
a day, one of the following would have to be accomplished to avoid'a substantial
increase in the Miami Cuban refugee population.

a» remove at least 100,000 refugees a year’ from the Miami area either
through resettlement or mandatory Government directed movement. Based upon
experience over the past two years, an orderly,, planned resettlement program of
this magnitude is almost impossible of accomplishment. The implications of
Government directed movement would require. policy. decisions at the highest’
level of Government.

be ‘construct or make use of existing facilities to serve as reception
or processing centers and to house refugees. in transit residence. Such a-
facility would have to provide lodging, mess, medical, protection, ‘and social
services as a minimum, School facilitieswould also have to be. provided ‘for
children, and language training, etc., for. adults. No effort has been madé’to./.
compute the costs involved, but. they would run into the millions of dollars,
More importantly, the "refugee camp," a concept which is highly undesirable
for reasons that are obvious, should be avoided.

Cc. use of Miami as a transit port of entry with:Government: directed
movement within 24 hours of arrival to the location of one or more Centers
elsewhere in the United States.

d. by-passing Miami as an initial point of entry and. establishing such
points in certain key locations. This would be.the equivalent of establishing
new refugee centers in a number of localities. It might be easier to by-pass
Miami completely in the first place than it would be to force movement from
Miami after entry.

For a review and analysis of the "é¢cnsiderations involved in establishing |
a@ second Cuban refugee center," see the’ attached summary of a study made in

‘March 1962, While the figures in that report are no longer valid, the paper

presents a fairly comprehensive review of virtually every factor--social to
fiscal--and lists eleven factors "militating against the establishment of"
another refugee center, (Incidentally, the additional costs are understated
based on current information, and such costs would be further increased ifthe
influx were approximately doubled over that contemplated the paper.) The study
was concerned with the establishment of a second center in New Orleans. However,
the same basic considerations would be valid for other areas.

e. A highly developed resettlement program (either out of Miami or out
of Miami and one or more-additional Centers) is an essential part of any approach
to the handling of additional refugees relating to restoration of flights --
regardless of the rate of arrival per week.

Regardless of what is done to reduce the impact on Miami, planned.
resettlement remains in our judgment the only long-range, constructive
approach either to handling the present refugee population in Miami or any
new refugee concentration elsewhere, As previously stated, the prospect
of reaching and maintaining an over-all resettlement rate at a 100. 1000~a~year.
level within the foreseeable future cannot be expected.

There are several steps which could be taken to enhance resettlement
opportunities, Several of these require. high-level policy decision but are
of great importance to an acceleration of the resettlement program. These
items include, among others:

(1) Adjustment’ of refugee status from that of parole or waiver to
that of alien admitted for permanent residence;

(2) Control over the type of refugees admitted to the United
States; ;
(3) Screening out of those who should be eliminated for reasons
of mental and physical health with due regard being paid to the
humanitarian aspect of reunion of families..

However, even if these steps were adopted, it is questionable whether’ »
the voluntary approach to resettlement could reach more than a 50,000-a-year
level.

Conclusions and Recommendations

It is our judgment that the foregoing information substantiates. the
following conclusions and recommendations.

Conclusions:
(1) That the facilities of Miami are such that it cannot.accept a. “\
restoration of an influx-of Cuban refugees of a magnitude approximating 400

to 500 a day. Furthermore, were this influx to be forced upon Miami, public b
opinion would react violently against such s a Move.

i

t

AW 50955

(2) That there are considerations of service and cost which make the
desirability of opening a second center subject to substantial question.

(3) That the question of Government directed movement of either the
existing Cuban population or new arrivals from Miami should receive the
highest possible policy consideration within the Government. The use of
facilities as reception centers should also be subject’ to the same type of
scrutiny.

(4) That not more than 50,000 Cuban refugees a year can be resettled
from the Miami (or other) area through a voluntary resettlement program. :

Recommendations:

Based upon the four above listed conclusions, the Department.of Health,
Education, and Welfare would strongly urge that the number of new Cuban refugees
permitted to enter this country be. restricted to a number which would not exceed
our ability to resettle them within the various’ communities of this country.

This maximum figure for the foreseeable future appears to be 50,000 a year, or
approximately 1,000 a week. This would represent approximately one flight per
day. This is only about one-third of the number who would enter if 400 to 500
Cuban refugees were admitted a day. Additional consideration can be given: to
this matter after appropriate exploration is made of alternative courses of action

such as the use of reception centers and Government directed movement. Consideration

should also be given to the possibility of controling emplanement of passengers
in Cuba to assure that to the extent possible priority is given to parents of .s-
unaccompanied children and to close relatives of Cuban refugees already in the‘
United States.

» SSA STAFF PAPER = CONSIDERATIONS INVOLVED IN ESTABLISHING A
SECOND CUBAN REFUGEE CENTER. IN.NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA

The establishment of a second Cuban refugee center in New Orleans has been
Proposed as one method of relieving the mounting pressure upon the social,
economic and health facilities. of Miami due to the increasing number of
Cuban refugées who enter the United States at Miami, Florida, and remain
there, i

To be effective, it would be necessary that Cuban refugees coming to ithe
United States be diverted from Miami, Thus, if no substantial number of x
additional refugees were to arrive in Miami and the voluntary agencies in

the Miami center would continue their resettlement activities with some
success, the pressures on Miami would be lessened, _ The optimum effect of

a second Cuban refugee center would be to reduce the migration of addi- i
tional refugees to Miami to a trickle and to relocate a number of those who
were in Miami prior to the establishment of a second center, To achieve

the above objectives, it is essential that:

1, The great bulk of Cuban refugees who would otherwise enter the
United States at Miami would be directed to New Orleans, Refugees
might travel to New Orleans via Miami where INS inspection would
take place, or travel directly to New Orleans,

2, Services similar to those in Miami be available to Cuban refugees in
New Orleans, If a stop~over in Miami was not made, the necessary
services would include INS inspection and.Federal center registration,
In any case, it would be necessary to provide financial assistance,
health care, education, resettlement, and employment for individuals
and families and care and protection of unaccompanied children,

In weighing the feasibility of a second refugee center, consideration should. ‘
be given to whether a second center would achieve the desired objectives

and if so, the price (financial and otherwise) which would need to be paid,
Important to this consideration are the current situation in Miami, the

flow of Cuban refugees to the United States, the cost of establishing a

second center for Cuban refugees and of providing the necessary supporting
services in New Orleans, and the effect any such move would have on Federal-
State relations and National Policy with respect to the refugees, :

A. Factors in Favor of Establishing a Second Cuban Refugee

Center_in New Orleans, Louisiana

1, A second refugee center located in any part of the United States
should drastically reduce the entry of Cubans in Miami, Boat travelers would.
continue to arrive in Miami and undoubtedly. some refugees entering. at New
Orléans would find their way to Miami, - But the overall effect in relieving
the social, economic, and health pressures upon Miami should be significant, °

DocId:32424020 Page 22 : B Roe



2-2

2, The absence of a large, wéll-established Cuban community in New.
Orleans might facilitate resettlement, There would be much less informal
help to Cuban refugees in finding housing, jobs, and adjusting to American
life than in Miami and less attraction to remain in New Orleans.

3, There is a limit to the number of refugees Miami can continue to
absorb without serious consequences. for its permanent residents and Cuban
refugees, It is not possible to determine. accurately what. this absorption ..
point might be, but it would seem that a city with a population of 980,000
could not absorb many more than.the approximately 100,000 Cuban refugees
already in Miami,

B, Factors Militating Against the Establishment of a Refugee
Center in New Orleans

1,. Getting the refugees to go to New Orleans. instead of Miami, Unless
we can either stop existing direct flights from Havana to Miami or. coerce
the choice of New Orleans, the Port of natural selection will continue to be
Miami, The only apparent means’of reversing the:process of natural selection
would be to use our influence so that the only direct flights available from
Cuba would be to New Orleans, With no other choice, presumably the New Orleans
flights would be filled, i.

2, In setting up another center in New Orleans, the Federal Government”
would be creating a local problem, The community would not be asking for
help because of problems created by natural inemigration. As such, DHEW
would be soliciting cooperation of State and local.authorities to act as the.’
agent of thé. Federal government in. providing certain services or in making
their facilities available to Cuban refugees, This was the converse of the’: ”
situation in Florida, Hence, there is no assurance that State and local
authorities would cooperate willingly with the Federal: government, or that
they would be willing to absorb certain costs, such as the Florida State
Department of Public Welfare and Dade County school system have done,

3. A second refugee center in New Orleans would add to program costs,
For example, to provide a level of assistance payments to Cuban refugees in
New Orleans commensurate with the public assistance programs would require
a monthly average payment of $85.85 per case whereas the Florida Department...
of Public Welfare estimated assistance payments for March 1962, at about
$72,55 per month, This alone would. require an additional 4 million plus
dollars, In addition, salary and office costs are higher in New Orleans
than in Miami, It is also assumed that Louisiana and: New Orleans would
expect to be reimbursed the full cost of educating children of Cuban refugees,
and that it would be necessary to accord similar consideration to Florida,
In'addition, the very fact of a second center would involve an increase. in
such items of expense as overhead, rental of IBM equipment, as well as con=
siderable communications, record-keeping, and coordination problems, with
resultant additional costs,

4, A second center may increase total resettlement and job placements. ©
but not necessarily in direct proportion to the staff engaged in resettlement
or job finding, Actually, two centers might be competing for approximately .
the same potential number of resettlenents and jobs. 7

NW 50955

DocId: 32424020 Page 23



5, The additional resettlements expected from a second refugee center. . z
might be realized by merely increasing the present resettlement staff in wee
the Miami center, Increasing the resettlement staff in Miami would consti-= :
tute a relatively small part of the additional cost of operating a second z
wefugee center, i a

6. Cuban refugees in New Orleans would need more help from agencies in”
locating housing and in using community services because the smaller Cuban
community in New Orleans could not provide the help furnished refugees by
the large and well established Cuban community of Miami,. Stated in the :
positive, the Miami Cuban community provides invaluable help to Cuban refugeés
in adjusting to a new culture and in-attaining self-support, . Because of a
lack of a large Cuban community in New Orleans it is also contemplated that a
higher proportion of registrants at the Center would apply for financial
assistance than is the case in Miami,

7. It would be difficult to justify the separation of families and to’! ”
prevent refugees with relatives or. friends in Miami from gravitating there, vse

8, Coordinating work of two centers would be complicated, time-consuming a
and expensive, and would probably require a sizeable administrative organization,

9, If the second center does not succeed in resettling refugees quickly,
it is possible that the result might be'another Miami, so that instead of ..:
solving one serious problem the Department may be confronted with two serious
problems, :

10, It would be difficult to arrange air transportation from Havana. to.”
New Orleans, No airline is flying that route presently and the cost of
transportation to New Orleans would probably be double the cost to Miami,
Since fares are now payable only in Cuban'pesos which must be spent in Cuba,
