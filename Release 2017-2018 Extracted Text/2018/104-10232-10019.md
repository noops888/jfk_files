of them hore, part in Cuba, He reiterated that a commande operation
was essential to bolater morale arnung tho anti-Castro elements in Cuba
and in exilo ae well as to conduct sabotage that would further weaken

Cuban economy and the Communist regime, Hoe aid that for thia operation

U. 5S, help would be neceasary in providing weapons, ammo, demolitions,
equipment, and funds. He proposed that if this plan was considered to
have merit, that Iarrango to hava somaone mect with hio military men

He said the Ambassador


\

Dr. MIRO sald there wag no way to determine the accuracy
of the figures given of planes, guna, etc, received irom the Sovict bloc
(and Laly and Canada) but even if-the figuroe were exaggerated 100 por
Cont, they would. still ba impressive, :

He added that Castro is datly bocoming stronger militarily
with weapons and with a largo militia of close to 300, 060 being trained
to use them while tho economy coutinues to deteriorate, Perhaps only
half the militia would be effective, But that is aiseable, Thus, he said,
the langer the delay in positive miltary action to overthrow Castre, the
greater will be the task. “We must act oon, vizorously and effectively,
to Inours victory, Another defeat would be disastrous and would make
Cubano, Latin Americana and others bollove Caatra to be invincible,
Thea wowd come accommodations and even worse, the implanting of
Castro-backod regiines in the hemisphere. And the U. S, would suffer
worst of all, being discredited for defeat and ‘guilt of interference,"
“In tho UN no nation would stand beside the U. 5,"

& Proposal that_¢ unctil go to Cuba with farmmando Group and
Establish a Goverument on Cuban Soll

Dr, MIRC thon declared that he was convinced that Castro
would nevor be overthrown by all tho propaganda, the sabotace, commando
falda, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating
economy, and that it wao inconceivable to establish » gevernmont-Imexile
for nothing would c: me of it; that the only golution far defeating tho

- Castro regime was for the Revolutionary Council to go te Cuba and estab-

eh @ government on Cuban soll, aak recognition by all iriendly count+iee
and military agsistance of ita priripal ally, the U. and that the U.8,
be ready to intervene immediately with ite Forcos, ‘This would all have
to take place in a roatter of 48 huurs, otherwise it would fall. 1 recognise
that this is a bold plan, but boldness is necessary. There will be many
rFioke, many may be killed, As for myseif, I don't care i die. Ihave
loat all my personal possessions and my son ia a priconer," He reiterated
that all must be well prepared in advance, there must be no vacillation,
everything must proceed rapidly, Firet, a consmando raid in force to
seine a plece of Cuban territory, preferably noar Guantanamo, and ima
diately the members of ihe Council yo ashore, proclalin a provisional
government, broadcast by radio te ali nations an appeal for recognition
{and cablee propared in advance wuld alee be sent out), requost U, 3,
assistance, and ths U. S$, should furnish euch assistance at once in ad:
quato atrongth to ensure victory.

ad

Before such an action fa undertaken, tae enemy aust be
softened by propazanda, sabotage, raids, underground action, and the
mags of the people of Cuba rust be prepared to accept the provisional
government througirpropayanda, increased knowledye of the Council
and its unifying efforts.

Dr, IRS asked me what I thought of this project; did I think
that Castro could be overthrown in any uther way. L admitted that
strong military action appeared nocessary. I stated further that
of course hia plan would have to be studied at the highest government
levela, He proposed that he inicht elaborate a pian with nie military
collaborators, and I puyoeted that he do this a9 that it might be examined

and considered,

Dr. MIAO declared that he was conviaced that thi Counmuntat
dagger in the side of the States could only be eradicated by such action,
that the U.S, ig and will be blamed for el! ant{-Castro propaganda,
sabotage, ste. and that enemy staten will denounce It for intervention
in Cuba, but that if the U, 5. goes to the ald af a friendly revolutionary
regizae established in the country and helpa it defeat the Soviet-backed
Communist regime, ail iriendly gevernmente will applaud,

“Lbave no personal politica! ambitions,” dociared MIRG,
“Liuerely am trying to chair the Coureil, whose mivsion is to unify tho
anti-Castro alemeats inatde and outside of Cuba, If tha team isn't con-
sidored effective, then change the pitcher, But U believe the Council must
eatablish iteelf on Cuban eoll, and soon, Ticne is against us.""The unta
del Fete agreeimoent will backfire ayainat the U. %. if Castro is allowed
to remain in Cuba, Ina year, after tho politicos of the countries ro-
colving U, 3. sid have gotten their kauds on U. 3. cold, they will bay,
‘Tharke te Castro, we got this,' And they will spend ft as in the past
with no benefits to the secial and economic welfare of the paople.”

7. Views about the Judges and j.awyors

Tquerted Dr, MIRC ao to his views relative to tha judges and
lawyers and their future status, He said ne honed that they could all
reunite and that they could be given ascietance a5 in the past. He de-
clared that Dr, ALABAU was not qualified to be a justice and that he woo
doing nothing bat making politics and trying to discredit the Council
and MIRC and VARGNA. Dr, MIRC declared that he, a9 Prime Minister
in the early days of tho Castro goverument, had named -LABAU to the



chal

Supreme Court, but that now he considered ALABAY unfit to hold any

judicial position,

8. Members of the Revolutionary. Council

Dr. MIRO remarked that he had a meeting of the Council on

10 October, [asked what elements now compoced it and what he pro-
posed to add, He named the following as presently in the Consejo:

He said ho had invited to Join:

and awaited their reply.

Ho would also like to have the Workers, Students, and the
Professionals (Dectors, Lawyers, ote.) come into the Council, He bee
Heves Batistianos and Comunistas and elements unwilling to cooperate
should be excluded, but that all other groupa should be brought together
undor the Council.

He contends that all anti-Castro activities, except clandosting
and military, should be coordinated by members of the Council, but that
the oxcepted activities should be known only to hina (MIRO).

9, Probabie Argentine Rupturs of Relations with Cubs

Dr. MIRO deciared tast he believed imminent the Argentine
rupture of relations with Cuba, He said the Argentine Ambassador to
Guba (Julio AMOEDO) was ordered to return to Havana {he had beon
vacationing in the U.S, after FRONDIZIe visit); that VILLANUEVA, a
Secretary of the Argentine Embassy in Cuba was coming to seo MIRO
today; and furthor that he (MIRO) had received a phone call last night

Wabile

from a Spaniard (Nicanor FERNANDEZ) in Buenos Airea, urging MIRO
te go to Buenos Airee to arouse anti-Caatro sentiment of the people,
{naomuch as somé Argentine action against Cuba appeared imminont.
(FERNANDEZ said ho had alroady written MIRC a letter.) MIRO cays,
“Of course, Leannot go. Ihave the Consejo meeting on the 10th,
Furthermore, Tam going to Now York on October 11th or 12th for the
SIP (Socieded Interamoricans de Prensa) meeting and have been allotted

12 minutes to addréss the mooting.

10. MIRO to attend Homage to LACE RDA (Brazilian who
Erecipitated QUADKO.5! rootynation) on October 15

Dr. MIRO said he planned to remain in New York City (after
11 and 12 Cctober SIP meeting) until October 15th to attend the homage
for LACERDA, the Governor of Guanabara province in Brasil, MIRO
probably will otay at the Park Chambers Hotel, but will advice Clark

of bie location.

1 commented thst ! would probably remain in Washington next
week in view of his plans, but that I might go to New York City to meet
with him; if ao, I would get in touch with him and arrange a meeting

timo and place through Clark.

11. Propaganda Commission

Tasked Dr, MIRO about hie ideas on the future organization
and structure of the Propaganda Commission. He stated that it ts out-
eide tha Conseje and not under his direct control, although the Council
accountant has been passing funds to it. He said CAR RILLCG had rosigned
ae head of Propagandz and that ho would like CONTE AGUERO to handle
it. He claimed that MESTRE had not done anything with propaganda,

12, MIRO's Views Relative to Supreme Court Justice or PRIO
Being Recognized ag Head of a Provisional Goverament

lasked Dr, MIRC if he belleved that thore were many anti-
Castro Cubans (both in and out of Cuba) who favored PRIC, or the head
of the Supreme, Court to be the provisional president if a government were
to bo established on Cuban soil. Lr, MIRO declared that the revolution
{a a fact, and that practically nobody wants to go back to any former
Fogime. The people in Cuba would resist any such possibility, He do-


nounced PRIO's activities ayalnot the Council and ite efforts to unify
the anti-Castro elemants. He said that the people should be given an
opportunity to elect their chiof of state after Castro’s overthrow and
ablishment of ordor in the island,

LY, Cifices of Council (Consejo Revolucionario)

When questioned about hia business and private telephones,
MIRO gafd, “The business phone ia alco in my house. I have no office
except in my house, but that phono is always busy (JEfforson 2-4680).
So use the other prone (JE{ferson 4-2751) when you wish to call me, "

"E need to have a small office somewhere away irom my home
because all the activities there are driving my wife ¢rasy. I want to
find something modest so that no accusation can be made of ostentation -
merely a room for myself, one for my secretary, and ona for meetings.
of the Council, ete. The FRD had a place but at that place also waa the
pross, the refugee center, etc, It would not be satisfactory, The FRD
fe now practically dead, It wao the forerunner of the Consejo as the
unifying agency of the anti-Castro resistance. "

14, MIROta Views on Goordinating the Activities of Cther Exile

Groups

After Dr, MIRO reiterated hia view that he should be the
channel for funds and cocrdinating the activities of groupa outside the
Consejo such as the Students, FORD (Labor), etc., tsaid that I under~
stood that somo of the: jementa were unwilling ty function undor the
Cenaejo; and that in view of that situation, did he consider that an
Activity Committee might be organised with a delegate {ram each of
these groups and under the chairmanship of a member of the Cansojo,
This would serve to coordinate their activitios, give them a tle-in with
the Coneejo, yet not make them subsorvient to it, Dr. MIRO repliod
that this would merely eet up another Consejo outside of and parallel to
the existing Consejo. I did not puroue this further, not having enough
background of these organisations to be able to discass tho matter

effectively.

15, Telophone Conversation with MIRO on 7 Cetobor

Before my departure from Miami for Washington on 7 October,
I telephoned to Dr, MIRO [vom the airport. Ho appreciated the call and
eked if I had seen in the morning paper tho action taken yeaterday by

Sst
the ALABAU Lawyoro' group in proclaiming Jullo CARCERAN (ono
of the chief justicos in oxile) as "President of Cuba at War," He exe
proased his indignation at this unilateral "political" move by ALABAU
and his adherents among the oxiled lawyers and judges. Ho addad his
beat wishes to ra2 and reminded me that ho would probably go to New
York on October 11th or 12th for the SIP (Socicdad Interamericana de
Prensa) meeting. I replied that { would appreciate if he would contact
Clark after his arrival to give his location in New York City, and that
Clark might havo a request from me for an appointment with him, if
this soomed dacirable. 1 suggested that in future phono conversations
I would be known ao JUANITG, He agreed with pleasuro that this would
be a good procedure. I wished him Godspeed and he replied Hkewise

to me,

16. Comment

During these first two meetings 1 endeavored to cstablich
myself favorably with Dr, MIRO and therefore refrained from bringing
up detaite of budget or opposition to any of his specific proposals.

I listened, asked various questions, and ho talxed at length.

In future meetings, after I have gained further background and
have more policy guidance, I shall be able to discuss with him apecific
jeoues and endeavor to reach agreoments or compromises, as may be

required.
