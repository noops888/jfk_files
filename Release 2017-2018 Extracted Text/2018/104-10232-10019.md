of the ligures given of planes, guno, etc, roceived irom the Sovlot bloc

hall the militla would bo efíoctive.

Dut that is alseable. Thus, be said,

the longor the delay in positive military action to ovorthrow Castro, tha

greater will be the task.

"We must set soon, viyoroudly and effectivaly,

to laouro victory. Anothes defeat would be dieastroua and would make

Cubano, Latla Amoricauo and others bollovo Castro to be invincible.

Then would come accommodationa and even worse, the implanting of

Castro-backod rayines in the homiaphere.

And the U. S. would suffer

raldo, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deterioraling

ocononsy, and that it was inconceivablo to establish a governmont irasile

This would all have

to tako place in a inalter of 18 houro, othervise it would fall. I rocognise

that this do a bold plan, bur boldness 15 necessary. Thare will be many

that the U,s, la and vill be blamed for all anti- Castro propajanda,

sabotage, etc. and that enemy states will dendance it los intervention

in Cuba, but thai if the U. S, noos to the ald a. a friendly revoluttonary
