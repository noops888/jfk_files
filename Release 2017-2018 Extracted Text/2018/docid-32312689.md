HARRINGTON, who was away from Paris for several

months, had allowed GIBSON, who was then single and living

in a hotel, the use of his

apartmant.

Vicient arguments

took place between the two men in connection with the

apartment,

and GIBSON resolved to seek revenge by trying

to bring about the expulsion of HARRINGIoN from france.

For this purpose he sent to a weekly American publication

and to the British daily "The Observer"

• over the signature

her could have brough

about the expulsion of their

author from France.

Upon being informed of the publication of

these articles of which he was not the author, HARRINGTON

located proof of the very probable guil's of CIBSON and

filed a complaint.

The resulting investigations which

was conducted by the Polise Judiciatre (Criminal Police)

of the surete Nationale, quickly led to che confession of

GIBSON, who admitted having tried to bring abois the

expulsion of HARRINgTON, to whom he apologized

and who accepted the apology before withdrawing his complaint

Although the Agence France Presse did not

so specify, it appears logical that 1t was as a result

this incident that GIBSON ceased working for that agency

The Investigation in connection with the

above matter, in addition to reflecting GIBSON's lack

of prineiples, also developed the following addisional

data11s: (6)

It was learned from a source in the Agence

France Fresse that GIBSON was the animator of a group for

aid to Cuba.

This report confirms another, received from

an American source,

to the effect that GIBSON was chairman

of the New York section of a crypto-Communist organization

"Fair Play for Cuba Committee" which had as its

purpose agitation in favor of the CASTRo regime In Cuba. fets)
