AND AMWOLF/1 AGREED. AFTER AMCHALK/S MADE THE PITCH, AMWOL F/I
REACTED BY SAYING "THESE 'JOHNIES* HAVE EVERYTHING AND NOW THEY
REALLY STEPPED ON ME". AMWOLF/1 ENDED THE CONVERSATION BY
AGAIN AKSING AMCHALK/5 TO CONE TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY
COULD HAVE ANOTHER TALK. AMWVOLF/1 RETURNED TO THE CaR WHERE HIS

3. AMCHALK/5 CONMENTED TO CASE OFFICER THAT KE DID NOT THINK

ANWOLF71 WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/5 BELIEVES WE SHOULD
WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTENPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER
MEETING OR TELEPHONE CALL. STATION AGREES WE SHOULD WAIT A FEW
DAYS-BUT THAT A TELEPHONE CALL SKOULD PRECEDE ANY MEETING. IF THE
TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED
WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HOS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE ,
WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM QUTINID IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT AFTER THE ENCOUNTER, AMWOLF/1 WENT TO THE
EMBASSY BUT DID NOT REMAIN, SURVEILLANCE WAS NOT ABLE TO LOCATE

1. I met AMCHALK-5 at 1430 hours at the Rusty Pelican
Restuarant. I told him wo would have him travel
immediately in order to arrive ee by 9 October. AMCHALK-5
said he could make it with no problem, ile wasn't sure hia wif .
would be able to go on such short notice, but that ul tter,
I briefed him on the contact arrangements sent qroaleecet| ena
described WIBALDA to him, I told him WIBALDA'S name is "ROBERTO,"

but of course if something goes wrong that he will go to all
the alternate meetings. Ho will be woaring a white sports
Jacket, white shirt, blug tie, blue slacks and black shoes.

2. I told AMCHALK~5 that WIBALDA would have tho letter
for AMGHOST-1 for hia to take to the meeting, and I told hin
again not to use the letter unless bie recruitmont pitch had
no results. If he does pass the letter, I sugyested that he
flex it to prove to AMWOLF-1 that it does not contain a bomb.

3. I told AMCHALK-5 that 1t looked good for a surprige
contact with AMWOLF-1 on 10 October sami because ho would bo
going to lunch with a woman not connected with his offico,
AMCHALK-5 was pleased to hear this mad because he feels he must
make tho coutact unannounced for it to be effective. Be said
that 1f the October 10 contact was missed, there would probably

be another m the following week AMCHALK-5 is willing
to stay in as long as necessary. ,

ANCHALK-5 was sorry to hear that I won't be going to
because he wants to be sure that he is given as much

lity as possible, and not torced to handle the approach
I told him

ex
in a manner that he woulc not be comfortable with,

i 4

%. We arranged to mect again at 1900 houra when AMCHALK-6

confidence. As you can see, in this instance,
we have selected an officer whose loyalty to
you is unquestioned. We intended to tell
PUSHKIN" of possible pitfalls in your path,

We still wish you to know of these dangers.

We realize that you are a true revolutionary

in every sense of the word. We have no

quarrel with you as a true revolutionary nor
with the system that has established itself

over the years, he will not countenance nor

do we belicve that you will countenance continued
foreign intervention in your system wherein
lies the major canger to your futre. We would
also like to make you an offer which would be
difficult for you to refuse. To contact one
of our reliable officers concerning this
opening o1 a two-way cnannel of communications
contact or have your selected man contact DIA
in which you showed some interest in 1967 and
he will then contact us. Ile will then relay
the time and meeting date to us, and we will
then open our dialogue using only trusted
personne],

Greetings,
L.

8, I believe that our chances for success in this
operation are reasonably good for the following reasons:

(a) A : ALK-5 is sufficiently courageou meet AMMOLF-1
in the C bassador's office inl if necessary;
(b) AMWOLF-1 a trusted colleague and follower of

AMGHOST-1, For this reason and in the belief that AMGHOST-1
was awaiting the message, he would find a way to deliver the
message uncpened to AMGHOST-1; (c) AMGHCST-1 from all
available reporting, background material, SI traffic, we have
reason to believe that AMCHOST-1 is not held in the confidence
of the Seviets nor does he respect their presence in Cuba,

a presence which can only be interpreted as promising
difficulties for AMGHCST-1; and (d) Bona fides for the
originator are contained in a copy of a letter from A GHOST -2
to her relatives which she signs with the name "PUSHKT

aT



I request authorizaticn to conmence this operation

teeeaiseely with appropriate alterations as required.

TO REVIEW AND LAY PLANS FOR OPERATION OF REF. ANCHALK-5

EAGER TO UNDERTAKE EFFORT TO EITHER (A) MAKE SELF ATTRACTIVE
TO DGI FOR DOUBLE AGENT PYRPOSES OR (B) PARTICIPATE IN POS-
SIBLE OPERATIONS FOR RECRUITMENT AND DEFECTION OF DGI PERSONNEL

DEPENDENT UPON HOW MEETINGS GO IN
2. FOLLGWING IS EXPLANATION WHICH AMCHALK-5 WILL PROVIDE

DGI OFFICER AS EXCUSE FOR REINITIATION OF CONTACT, I.E. THAT

HE TOTALLY DISILLUSIONED WITH ACTIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT VIS
A-VIS CUBA, THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AS IS WELL KNOWN IN THE
MLAMI AREA, HAS TERMINATED ALL OF ITS MILITANT ACTION CAPABILITY
AGAINST CUBA, AND THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN DEFINITIVELY TERMI-
NATED. THIS WILL BE MOST PLAUSIBLE TO DGI SINCE THEY UNDOUBT-
EDLY AWARE OF TALK IN EXILE COMMUNITY OF MASS TERMINATIONS.
AMCHALK-5 WILL THEN EXPLAIN THAT SINCE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
CANNOT BE COUNTED ON FOR ANYTHING HE HAS TAKEN IT UPON HIMSELF

AND THAT HE IS WILLING TO COOPERATE WITHIN LIMITS TO DO THIS
AWD THUS HZ HAS REQUESTED DISCUSSIONS WITH DGI. THIS IS A
MOST PLAUSIBLE STORY SINCE DISILLUSIONMENT IS COMMON

AMONG FORMER MILITANT EMPLOYEES OF RVROCK. WE PRESUME THAT

POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL BE PREPARED TO CONCRETELY TASK HIM

AND HE MAY HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS WHILE IN THUS

BELIEVE IT IMPORTANT THAT A WH/MIAMI OFFICER BE PRESENT IN

TO COVER THIS CONTINGENCY.

5. AECHALE-5 may also bo terminated within this

fisesl yoar, He has managed to develop 5 successful,
full-timo business and is only slightly involved in
operational activity. Wo are bolding off on his termination
bocauss of the potentially interesting operational situation
discussed in paragraph 12 of reference. AECHALE-5 thinks
the black marketeers referred to may be on the verge of
another trip to Niani, It might be interesting from the
JEROD standpoint to "piggyback" that channel and send in
am incriminating package to a JMMOD target, AHCHALE-3
as the source of the package is already well identified
through the AMGHOST operation as affiliated with RVRCCK,
There are the two possibilities that tho couriers thomselves
would open the package, inspoct tho contents and turn the

29 package over to the DSE or that they would deliver
it unopened to the target, In the latter case the target
might oither turn it over to the D8Y, destroy it, or make
use of the contents for his own benefit. Content of the
package would of course have to be tailored to the target
but it might purport to bs an agent re-supply cache,
Hany possible avenues would have to be explored; for the
moment ve would appreciate consideration of the proposal
by tho Desk and JMROD staff. ne of the first items to
be rosolved is whether or not there is an inherent "blow-
back" feature of tho situation which could cause too such
enbarranarent if exposed to press play, Specifically,
is there a cage for an allegatioa that RVROCK was using

the international organization with whieh tho “couriers”
aro effiliated for “subversive” purposes? The ansver to
tbat question probably lios somewhere in betweon what tha
eontents of the package consists of and to what lengthy
the Cubana would bo willing to go to “bura” the “loyal

2. When AMBEDEW-1 was working fur the couter revolutionary

section, be became acquainted with the case of the penctration of

Miguel Diss Isalgue’s group.

2. In this operation, the Cuban DOI collaborator who acted 45
principal egent was Horta Gonzaler, authoress of Bajo Porole. She came
to the United Statos as an exile in 1963 (nore or less) and lived in
Mio, B8he wo handled by "Bolo" Martinez, Cuban B49 DOI Case Officer
tn the United Nations who would see Yarte in New Tork and Mand.

3. Marte recruited two agents (at lesst), one of whom ws o
won, Ho did not recall the sex of the other. She had an "infinity®
of contacts in Miami and sant detailed reports to Habana on exile
organizations and intzo-nural exile politica. Ke does remember that
Yorts was Living in tho house of the woran she recruited. She used to
send reporta on Verona and Rey. Wor mission was to penetrate Alpha 66.

\,, AMBRDEW-1 remombers from reports that he read thats

Marta Oonsales knew the places where the reception team would

meet infiltrators of Iealgue's group.
Marta Gonssler knew the naees of fishernen rho were menbers of

the reception team.
Marte Oonsales knew that Isalgue's Bef mother's house wes used

eo 8 "oasa de contacto" and that Comandante Guin waa recruited by Isalgue
in the nother'a house.

Ss Gan Miami #4 supply a List of names of people close to Isalgue
to boo if AMBEDEWe1 can recoll the agents names, AMEDEY-1 thinks there

More on Iselgue. He has one sister in Habana, a woman nomed Sara. The DOI
suspects her of boing recruited by Isalgue oven though ANBEDEW-1 could not
substantiate this other than to say that she was the only brother or sister of
Tpalgue still in Cuba. Sara is very close to Fidel and the DOI would not
