1àoa hou DIAz might have

got it. I told Pit was a sonsitive ad ress which ve

did noi want to lave blown, asked him to contact DIAZ, ostensibly because

KALBINa (who long ago was having P prine DIAZ for a trio to

which

never cano off) had sent regards and an expianation of why the

thing

foll thru? P is to make no mention of the Coral liables adiress or the letter,

but assumine DIN. will bring it up, to try to discover how DIAZ got that address,

3. ANCHALK/S COMMENTED TO CASS OFFICER THAT HE DID NOT THINK

AMWOLFIL WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALN/S BELIEVES WE SHOULD

WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER

MEETING OR TELEPHONE CALL. STATION AGREES WE SHOULD WAIT A FEW

DAYS-BUT THAT A TELEPHONE CALL SHOULD PRECEDE ANY MEETING. IF THE

TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED

WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE

WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM GUTINID IN THE NEXI SEVERAL DAYS.

ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT AFTER THE ENCOUNTER, AMWOLF/I WENT TO THE

with AMCHALK-5 and that AMCHALK-5 should not make

meeting with DGI without surveillance by SMABOVE.

WH/Miami) will consult with SMABOVE to assure coverage

of meeting. Ref C requests no contact between NOLTHAM

and AMCHALK-5 fox fear that operation would be exposed

to DGI. Ref D requests that operation proceed only if

DEPENDENT UPON HOW MEETINGS GO IN

2. FOLLOWING IS EXPLANATION WHICH AMCHALK-S WILL PROVIDE

DGI OFFICER AS EXCUSE FOR REINITIATION OF CONTACI, I.E. THAT

HE TOTALLY DISILLUSIONED WITH ACTIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT VIS-

A-VIS CUBA, THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AS IS WELL KNOWN IN THE

MIAMI AREA, HAS TERMINATED ALL OF ITS MILITANI ACTION CAPABILITY

AGAINST CUBA, AND THAT HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN DEFINITIVELY TERMI-

NATED. THIS WILL BE MOST PLAUSIBLE TO DGI SINCE THEY UNDOUBI-

EDLY AWARE OF TALK IN EXILE COMMUNITY OF MASS TERMINATIONS.

AMCHALX-S WILL THEN EXPLAIN THAT SINCE INE U.S. GOVERNMENT

CANNOI BE COUNTED ON FOR ANYTHING HE HAS TAKEN II UPON HIMSELF

We are bolding off ou his termination

bocauso of the potentiolly intoresting operational situstion

dibcuseei in paragriph 12 of reforenco.

AACHALE-5 thinks

the black parketeers roferred to may be on the vorgo of

another trip to Miaul.

It migbt bo interesting fron tho

JEROD standpoint to

"piggyback" that channel and send in

an incrininating paciago to a Judo target.

ARCHALE -5

as the source of

tho package la alrezdy vall identified

through the ANCHOST operation as alliliated

with BRock.

therg

are the tro possibilities that tho courters thomselves

would open the paciago, inspoet the contente and turn the

whole package over

to the dat or that they would deliver

it unopened to the target.

In the latter case the target

might oither turn it over to the bes, destroy it, or make

use of the contents for his own beneiit.

Content of the

packoge rould of course have to be tallored to the targot

but it might purport to be an agent re-supply cache.

Enny posaiblo avenues would have to be explored; for the

Bocent vo could appreciate consideration of the propooal

by the Desk and JIROD staff.

Ono of the first itong to

be rosolved te whother or

not there is an inherent

back" feature of the situation which could causo too muc!

embarrasanent si exposed to prosa play.

Specifically,

is there a case for an allegation that BMOCK was using

the intermtional orgentration with shich tho courtarg"

aro affiliated for

that question probably lios somewhere in betreon what the

contents of the paciage consists of and to what longtha
