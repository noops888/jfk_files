on 3/8/63, Dr. Enio Zayas, Newark, NJ, a Cuban refugee,

advised that before he came

to the US in

August, 1962, he was associated with his father, Dr. Constantino

zayas, owner of Linner Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Havana, Cuba.

He stated that in early 1959, several meetings were held in Havana

for the purpose of ousting the Somoza regime in Nicaragua. Dr. Manuel

Lacayo Farfan was the leader of this group.

Zayas and his father went

to Costa Rica in June, 1960, on a business trip, however, his father

wished to meet with various

Nicaraguans living in exile in Costa Rica

for the purpose of deposing of the Somoza regime.

Shortly after they

arrived they met with Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo.

At that time Gutierrez

was still Commandante of the Cuban Army and

had gone to Costa Rica

secretly by way of Mexico.

At a subsequent

meeting Dr. Lacayo

offered the position of leader of the war effort against Nicaragua

to Gutierrez, which he accepted. However something®

forced a

cancellation of all these plans. It was Zayas' opinion that something

happened between Gutierrez and

Fidel Castro, and Gutierrez had to

flee Cuba.

Zayas stated that he did not know of any subsequent plans
