Fold Comsent: TDCSDG-315/02530-65, dated 27 July 1965, reported

the plans o1 the Moviniento Democrata Cristiano Me, Christian

Donocratle Hoveront) to attack the distillery at Santa. Cruz del

Norto - Oporation Cacabual - on

the night of either 27 or 28 July.

This plan

Involved the use of two craft, the BERNARDO. II, a

nother ship, and the VICKY I, an oporational boat that was to

carry the

raiding party to Cuban slores.

TDCSDE-315/02538-65,

dated 28 July 1905,

roported that the planned raid

did not

succeed

because one of the

craft in the raiding flotilla

had apparently

been intercepted by a vessol holioved to have been a United

Strtes Navy vessol.

Sinco the

The Santa Cruz distillery. was solectod as n largot bocause it la

the second most Important distillery in Cuba and because the MDC

bad roceived information that a special gasoline to lo used for

milltary purposes was being distilled there.

As a result of the designation of Hernandoz. Rojo as chief of the

MC's military

three raid operations sere preparod

between late June and late July.

In addition to Operation Cacabual,

the MDC has prepared Operation

laceo, which involvey a naval

attack against the radar installations at Cabo de San Antonio on

the Peninsula of Guanahncabibes,

Pinar. dol Rio Province, and

Operation Machete, which is to be directed against the

destruction

of the refrigeration equipment

at the fishing cooperative in

Dimas, Pinas del Rio Provinco, 4

These to operations are ex

pected to be launched as soon as circumstances permit.

The MDC has always had the pollcy of conducting military opera-

tions againat Cuba, but 1: had not been able to do anything because

of the lack of strongth of laureano Batista Falla, forner military

leader of

Batista Falla had knowledge of Operation

Cacahual, but ho

did not participate in 1t.

The milltary budget of the MDC is $750. per month, which amount

18 received from Batista Falla's private funds.

Howover,

expects to recoive financial assistance from its delegations in

Puerto Rico, Vonezuola, Mexico, Now Yurk and fest Germny.

•Field Comments:

1. The W-12 has been identifled as a United States Coast Guard

vessel out of New Orleans,

Loulsiana.

The Coast Guard has

• denied the involvement of

the W-12 in this incident.

2.

Another source, who has been trained in information collection

and whose previous

reporting has been accurate but lacking

in depth, has reported

that, according to Angel M. Hernandez

Rojo, the crew of the VICKY I first became aware

that they

were

being pursued when they were about 23 milos from Key

West on

the night of 26 July.

3.

CSDB-312/01498-65,

dated 24 June 1965, reported that Hernandez

Rojo had been appointed chief of the

military

sector and was

to assume his responsibilities

immediately
