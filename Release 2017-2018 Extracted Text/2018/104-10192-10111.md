SOURCE: A member of a group of Cuban emigres trained in the techniques
of information collection, The group has provided useful
reports since 1961.

1. Field Comnent: TDCSDB-315/02530-65, dated 27 July.1965, reported
The plans of the Movimiento Democrata Cristiano (MDC, Christian
Democratic Hoverent) to attack the distillery at Santa Cruz del
Norte - Operation Cacabual - oa the night of either 27 or 28 July.
This plan involved the use of two craft, the BERNARDO. II, a
mother ship, and the VICKY I, an operational boat that was to
earry the raiding party to Cuban sloves, TDCSDB-315/02538-65,
dated 28 July 1965, reported that the planned raid did not succeed
because one of the craft in the raiding flotilla had apparently
been intercepted by a vessel bolioved to have been a United

States Navy vessel,

2. ‘Tha following persons were aboard the VICKY I on 26 July 1965
when she was intercepted by a United States naval vessol bearing
number W-42:1 Angel M. Hernandez Rojo, Placido A, Barbeite
Freyre, Aurelio Pena, aka "Yeyo,” and two other persons mmed
Jorge (inu) and Edgardo (lau), Personnel aboard the BERNARDO II
included Angel Vega Guillen, Adela de Ja Canpa do la Torre, and
Ricardo Garcia,

3, Operation Cacabual failed Lecausy the naval vessel degao, pursuing
the VICKY I even before she reached international waters,4 Once
she had reached international waters the naval vessel began
signaling the craft in Morse code /asing a blinker light,

The naval vessel then turned on several of her searchlights uatil
one of theu spotted the MDC boat, The vessel proceeded toward

the boat, wnt alongside her, but the authorities did not board
hor. Sinco the dock of the vossol was ‘considerably higher than
that of the MDC toat, it way oasy for the authoritios to observe
aboard her a 57+mmi rocoilless cannon, 4& 20-ma Finnish-mde
cannon, an AR-15 rifle, and. two Germait machine guns, In order

to avoid arrest and having their poat confiscated, the crow of

the VICKY I decided to throw all their weapons averboard. Once

: they accomplished this, tho naval vessol left.

The Santa Cruz distillery. was selected as a target because it ts °
the second most important distillery in Cuba'and because tho MDC
bad received information that a special gasoline to be used for
military purposes was being distilled there,

As a result of the designation of Hernandez Rojo as chief of the
MDC's military sector,), three raid operations were prepared ‘|
between late June and late July. In addition to Operation Cacahual,
the MDC has prepared Operation Maceo, which involves a naval

attack against the radar installations at Cabo de San Antonio on
the Peninsula of Guanahacabibes, Pinar del Rio Province, and
Operation Machete, which is to be directed against the destruction

of the refrigeration equipment at the fishing cooperative in

Dimas, Pinar. del Rio Province.4 These two operations are ex-
pected to be launched as svon as circumstances permit.

‘he MDC has always had the policy'of conducting military opera~
tions against Cuba, but tt had not been able to do anything because
of the lack of strongth of Laureano Batista Falla, former military
leader of the MDC, Butista Falla had Knowledge of Operation
Cacahual, but he did not participate in it.

The military budget of the MDC is $750, per month, which amount
is received from Batista Falla‘s private funds, However, the MDC
expects to receive financial assistance from its delegations in
Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Mexico, New York and West Germany.

Field Comments:

1. The W-42 has been“identified as a United States Coast Guard
vessel out of New Orleans, Louisiana, The Coast Guard has
denied the involvement of the W-42 in this incident,

2. Another source, who has been trained in informtion collection
and whose previous reporting has been accurate but lacking
in depth, has reported that, according to Angel M. Hernandez
Rojo, the crew of the VICKY I first became aware that’ they
were boing pursued whén they were about 23 miles from Key
West on the night of 2G July.

3. CSDB-312/01498-65, dated 24 June 1965, reported that Hernand 2
Rojo had been appointed chief of the military sector and was
to assume his responsibilities immediately.

4, The same source recently reported in detail on Operations
Maceo and Machete in UFG-7445,
