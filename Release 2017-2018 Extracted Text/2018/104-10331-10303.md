Memo to: C/HRG

Subject: Status of DCI Morning Minutes

Following covers both your questions and Bob Eatinger's
notes on a number of items. Per Jim Pittman, he did not
follow up on Batinger's questions.

C/HRG questions:

1. 10 Aug 1976 - DCI Bush's letter re meeting with Senators

Baker and Inouye. FYI copy faxed to OCA (contact|
37912)

2. 24 Aug 1976 - per Office of Security, protect
retired in cover status, was NOC in Vietnani-

3. 12 Nov 1976 - The David Wise book mentioned in in the
Minutes deals with (he bugging of the Chilean Embassy in
Washington) not the Kennedy assassination. Recommend we
drop the item as not. related. The note on the page is
Eatinger's. (copy attached)

4. 28 June 1976 - Re the copyright question; Eatinger says
to postpone the item until the Board makes a ruling. The
law is silence on copyright issue. We will describe the
document on the withdrawal sheet so researched can request
directly from CBS.

6 & 7 3 March/25 Sept. 1978 - Per Office of Security,
vincent Thill and James O'Connell are releasable.

9. Attachment #2 (LBJ Library) - Per Pittman, these
documents were Not part of the Morning Minutes file. His
staff remembered them from a FOIA; they probably exist
somewhere in the DCI files. Do we include as part of this
package or assume we will see again when we go to the
Presidential Libraries?

Eatinger's notes (attached):

4 May 1964 - since we are treating "anti-Castro" activities
as related, leave the reference to books in.

24 Sept 1975 - Eatinger is having the cases searched in OGC
files for relevance to JFK.


13-00000

25 Sept 1975 - The New Orleans mail intercept operation was
of interest to the HSCA investigation and has been mentioned
in our files. The item refers to the Senate Select
Committee and it is doubtful if it is JFK related. Eatinger
says it is our call.

26 July 1978 (memo for the Record) - Eatinger was not
comfortable with our deletion [ ]; he has originally
proposed to release. I recommended that we at least delete
the word prison. There may not have been many women in
prison with that background.

Falkiewicz noted his expectation that Ron Kessler's article on
President Kennedy's assassination will appear in the 14 November Wash-

ington Post.

Bolten called attention to today's Washington Post article about
David Wise's book (attached) and stated his belief that it contains details
which were not included in the Senate's published report. It was agreed
that this material was deleted from the Senate report and that Wise's

account is_ correct In response to the DDCI's query, Bolten stated that

we had not had prior word of the Wise book.

The FBI reluctantly bugged the

end the surveillance, according to:
a forthcoming book about the U.S.

‘The Director was on leave; Mr. Carlucci was testifying on the Hill;
Mr. Blake chaired the meeting.

\
Mc. Blake asked Hetu to explain the disturbing ABC story emanating

from Havana. Hetu said that ABC reporter Reynolds called him and said

that as part of Cuba's 26 July celebration, a double agent will march in

a parade and appear at a press conference, saying that CIA tried to prove

that Cubans were involved in President Kennedy's assassination. Castro

also plans to announce CIA activities in Africa to track the Cuban presence

there. Hetu told Reynolds that he hesitated to comment at the present time

but the charge regarding the Kennedy assassination was ridiculous. {

McMahon summarized an FBI report that a Cuban Intelligence Service
official has been in contact with an unidentified journalist in connection
with the World Youth Festival now taking place in Cuba. The journalist
stated that the festival will include a.tribunal that will condemn CIA
activities throughout the world. It will also reveal the above-mentioned
charge that the CIA tried to prove Cuban involvement in President Kennedy's
assassination. Former CIA agents will be revealed as well as proof of CIA
activities in Africa. This report also mentioned that a press conference
will be held.
