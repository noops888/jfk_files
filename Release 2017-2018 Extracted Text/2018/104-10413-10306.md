SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and

Unidentified Man

That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with
the “unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet
Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The “unidentified man"
was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of

"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.

- According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the

USSR in 1964. in the U.S. in October 1963

7 MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist
and often attends international conferences. He
has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in

the U.S.

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of
"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved
in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:

7 he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in
Dallas on 20 November.

7 That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in
Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the
identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been

fingered to him in Mexico City.


- that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination
plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed

Kennedy.

- that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",
was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a

disguise.

QUESTIONS
1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?

2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who
boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22
November 1963?

3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without

Cuban knowledge?

RECOMMENDATION
1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he
has delivered speeches at scientific conferences
in U.S. and abroad?
2. If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)

hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"!

as orce


van we find ,hotc that PENKOVSKY identified of

MOSKALEVSKIY.
May I see PENKOVSKIY's 201 file for period 61-63?
Get photos and check dut MOISEEV and BABKOV.

Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN
and ROSTVOROFF?

Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with

him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

listed as "Uptake and Retention of
Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was
presented. When he spoke he changed the
title to "Problems of Kenetics of Uptake

paper presented nothing new and can be
described as elementary. He apparently
spoke no English.

UMOSKALEV, one of the Soviet delegates,
was frequent commentator on other people's
work and made a practice of denigrating
their reports with respect to radiation
lethality.
Sources (3 U.S. scientists) were asked
if they thought MOSKALEV's objectives
were motivated from anything more than
genuine scientific position. They
responded - "Who can say?" MOSKALEY,
both from papers he gave and his questions

of conference that he did not know enough
English to read his paper which also
required condensation because it was too
long for the time allowed. A colleague
who had known MOSKALEV from previous meet-
ings said MOSKALEV's knowledge of English
improved gréatly after a Yew drinks.
However, he did not drink at all during
this conference. He did mention that he
had written the English version of the
paper he presented himself. A respected
U.S. scientisi with nore exper ence

than MOSKALEV said he frankly did not
believe MOSKALEV's findings. (Said this

in private.) MOSKALEV atzempted to

make propaganda of a report by a West
German. MOSKALEV left the conference a
little upset. He took copious notes on
all papers, which indicated he understood
What was going on. He also took many
pictures with a 35 mm camera, From questions
he asked in private, it was obvious he
understood English quite well. Considerable

April 1977
MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible Identity of the "Unidentified Man”
Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963
REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City
Station
B. Paperback Boot “Appointment in Dallas"
C. Soit File, Headquarters Information on
Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, Possible

“Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified man were taken by
our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going
into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in
Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas,
Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have
appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of
the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in
Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never been:
identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI1) recognized photographs of
the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met
in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course
there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish
speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cuban group,

about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with


-2-
the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same building
in Moscow, Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve
it for them, Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB
officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the
West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member
that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

- elandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). yuri
was entrusted with their welfare only, and.did not attend classes
with the Cuban group.

3.  SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an
individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description
of the unidentified man, This lead to an individual by the
name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor
of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international
scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.
Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a
sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service, Many
of the documents in his dossier are OO reports from U.S.
scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at
scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater
knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability
is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is
noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.
It is also noted that on _ occasions he reportedly was not
qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference,

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

(by

Following are items of interest from selected documents in
MOSKALEV's CRS dossier:

a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no
name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY,
Air Force Col,and GRU officer in the Information Directorate
of the GRU.

b. [In December 1963 the FBI reported *

c. In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to the
IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,
New York. Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV
was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made
a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to
radiation lethality.

d. In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second
International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early, He


travelled’ a4 as Sun Valley and apnare . | was able to use
his Dicwiedae of the English language to get along on his ow.
Although he complained about not !nowing much English, he
admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.
MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West
German scientist. A respected U.S. scientist said he fran‘ly
did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious
notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was
going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.
From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he new
English quite well. Although considerable time was spent
arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route to
his home, he took a different route, without telling anyone

Fé:

of his plans, and did not visit the lab.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of |
the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared
photos of the unidentified man with photos of Mg Yuriy

Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI,[___JLiaison, and CRS.

_It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely ke

identifiable with the unidentified man.
5. Page 59 of the book “Appointment in Dallas," shows an

Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the

author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination

of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code
name Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, kears
a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich
MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the
picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhitit #237 as

havbng been taken at the Russian Emkassy in Mexico City,

either in the foyer or just outside.


6.

ATTN :

FROM : Graphics and Authentication Division/Senior Operations Officer

SUBJECT : Photo Comparison
REFERENCE : DDO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977

1. On 23 March rane ?t Latin America Division handcarried
photographs to OTS/GAI y Tdentirication comparison. These photos were
examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise
and Identification Section.

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:

A. Facial Shape - Close similarities, although there are slight
differences which are probably due to subject's age differences.

B. Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing
is most apparent here.

C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of
time factored in.

D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.
(Comparison of eve detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)

E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but
the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend
from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet. This could
be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.

F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth and
the whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps
the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities
are very close.

EGRET


SUBJECT: Photo Comaprison
PAGE -2-

G. The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of
the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin.

3. The results of this type comparison are rarely absolute and are
usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle.
With that understood it is our opinion the two subjects of the forementioned
photo comparison could very likely be the same person. If additional
photographs of the subjects, particularly if they are of better quality,
are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.

SOURCE

1. In October 19H poecuee of Biophysics, Ministry
of Public Healtl—voscow Se tral Advance:
Institute for Training of Physicians, oe visited several US
biological and biophysical research facilities. During one of these
visits it was learned from Moskalev that ie is the Chairman of the
USSR equivalent to the US National Council on Radiation Protection.
In this position, Moiseev is Noskalev's secretary.

2._ Motieev was a difficult individual to figure out. He stated that his
~“"Eraining is in health physics and that bis job in the USSK is to be
informed at all times of the status of US nealth physics and radiation
protection programs. He said that he reads the US journal "Health
Physics" regularly as well as other Western radiation research journals.
Although in discussions with Moiseev he appeared to be technically
competent, he kept very close to Moskalev and rarely let him out of
his sight. If Moiseev is Moskalev's "guardian" (as he appeared to be)
he let his om guard down during a cocktail party hosted by Dr David i
Taylor, Department of Biophysics, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont,
UK. During the course of the evening Moiseev consumed countless gin
and tonics util he could barely articulate. MNoskalev, on the other
hand, sipped one or two drinks all evening.

| 3. Moskalev was a very adept diplomat. He finds it easy and

| t to adopt his conversation to wiatever kind of group he is
with. We talked at considerable length about the role of women in the
Soviet economy and mentioned that his own vife is a pathologist. He
was always much freer in lis conversation vhen Moiseev was out of
hearing.

4. In terns of his professional work, Moskalev stated that he has a
i program in the USSR of exposing dogs to various dees of radiation
to learn the biomedical effects of radiation. it is a program quite

5 similar to that at the Lovelace Foundation in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 5

he implied was sufficient, comes from the Soviet Ministry of Health.
The actual Soviet work with the dogs is virtually parallel that in
the US. It involves studying the lov level effects of radiation
from inhaled or injected materials.

Moskalev's work appears to be very good as far as it has gone.

But he has only worked with nitrates and chlorides of plutonium,

not with plutonium oxide. Oxides (solid components) should be of
interest te anyone working in this field because the chemical forns
of plutoniua are quite useful to know about when doing accident type
studies — to understand plutonium metals it is essential to know
about plutonium oxide. Whether the Soviets are working only with
solutions rather than oxides is not known, It is alvays possible,
of course, that Soviet work with plutonium oxides is classified.

Visit to Life Sciences Laboratory

On October 1, Drs. Moskalev and Moiseev were escorted to the 331
Building by W. J. Bair. Discussions with the staff occurred during

the day in the conference room with visits to various laboratory -
facilities occurring as necessary.



D. G, Williams -3- Uetober 29, 19/1

Dr. J. F. Park - Past, present, and future riments on the
biological effects of inhaled plutonium in laboratory animals
therapeutic removal of inhaled plutonium, and USSR recommendations
to the ICRP to lower plutonium MPC's were discussed. ‘These Scvict
scientists have completed more work on the biological effects of
inhaled plutonium in animals than any other research group except
our own laboratory, The interchange of experir
and concepts was valuable for planning our future res
evaluating the results of past and present research. Since they
have reported biological effects of inhaled plutonium in experin
animals at extremely low exposyre levels and recommended to the ICR?
that limits of exposure should be lowered, the opportunity to
understand and evaluate their experimental results, interpretation
and logic in making their recommendations was very useful.

Dr. V. H. Smith - Drs, Moiseev and Moskalev were reasonably well
acquainted with the field of therapy for plutonium poisoning but
not intimately in terms of details or recent Soviet literature; the
former because his field was more on the ecological side, and the
latter because he has concentrated on radiation effects and ceased
active work on removal about ten years ago. Dr. Moskalev was inter>
ested in our plans to test phosphorothioic acids as removal agents
and mentioned his own work on the removal of 1#%ce with DTPA as an
evample of rhe rimind of treatment. He scared DTPA was dives i.ve
to humans in the USSR, not by inhalation, ana that Zn-Du?PA Ss not
used or being experimented with. |The latter is difficult to believe,
due to his former close relationship with Dr. Catsch. He was not
Batisfied with the lack of side effects of multiplé"DTPA treatments
and said that some problems with bone in long-term experiments could
be due to DTPA but he wasn't aware of the detzils. Answers to ques
about other treatments than DTPA, experience in treating humans, oz

future plans were noi obtained because presuzcbly this was not a
primary research concern of Dr. Moskaley, although he did state
there was considerable research effort in this field.

Dr. C. L. Sanders discussed our low-level inhaled ***Puv, studies
(life-span), metabolism of plutonium and cellular interaction with
Pu0g particles. The Russians were particulaxly informative in
describing their low-level life span studies with 239Pu. It was
learned that Dr. Moiseev is primarily a radioecologist who worked
in Siberia and is familiar with oil pipe lines and associated
ecological problems such as arctic and lake pollution problens.

Dr. J. E. Ballou discussed their studies with soluble plutonium
compounds, comparative metabolism and effects of DTPA, and our
americium, plutonium, and cerium work. Dr. Moskalev had tricd
inhaled EDTA therapy many years ago to no avail. He was interested
in our work with age effects on gut absorption and wanted to
why the very young absorb more plutonium. He agreed there is
prolonged gut transit time and different intestinal morphology in

Other Activities

Dering the week, in addition to participating in the Symposium
social functions. they were guests in es of Dr. W. ivier
Rivgctor, Avomic Energy Con
Richland, Drs. W. J. air and C. L. Sanders. These occasions
enjoyable for the hoscs and, apparently, for the visitors, Dr..
Moskalev is an excellent chess player and very patiently played “chess
‘with both adults and children. Dr. Moiseev was interested in current
fashions and consumer products. Mrs. Bair gave him the current Sears
and Roebuck Christmas catalog as an example cf consumer prod
He was familiar with the mail order concept but we could not ester
for certain that it is common in the USSR. _Both Drs. Moskalev_and

i. Status"1adder in USSR science, but it was also obvious that Dr.
lev's dacha is a level above Dr. Moiseev's.
isitors also expressed interest in our standard of living. The
visits to our homes seemed to dispel some doubts they might have had
about our standaré@ of living. They seemed particularly to enjoy
the opportunity to meet our children.

There were four guests in the group:

Dr. (Prof! Uns te-0f Biophysics, Mindstry_of Publig
OO2SYT

Dr. Alexei A. Moiseev; Central Inst. for Advanced Medical Studies, Moscow

Dr. Jean-Claude Nénot; CEA, Centre D'Etudes Nuclaires, Fontenay-aux~
Roves, France.

Dr. R. Nasse,; CEA as above,

Mrs. Anng Low-Beer picked up the four guests in Sm Francisco and brought
them to the Donner Laboratory where they were greeted by Dr. John Lawrence,
Drs. Donald Van Dyke, James MoRae, and Howard Parker took them on a short
tour of the Anger camera facility and whole-body counting and scanning
equipment. The current uses and potential in medical diagnosis were dis-
cussed. Major questions concerned the use of these instruments in monit-
oring and assessing the extent of persons contaminated with radionuclides
in industrial accidents.

Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and
Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide through
the day. Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium
symposium, The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamina-
tion by-alpha-emitting isotopes yas considered. The two techniques are
lung lavage and aerosolized cheghbing agents, particularly DIPA.

A tour of Bldg. 74 followed lunch. Three of the visitors are biologists-~
Ors. Mosieahey and Nénot arg physicians, and Dr. Masse is a veterinarian -~
‘an fe an ‘experiments or the interpretation of the results
of animal experiments. They were much interested in how one achieved
and managed a “biologically clean" rodent colony, in the minimum mainte
nance rabbit rooms, and the cage-washing facilities. There was some
discussion about the 90-Sr-injected monkeys, therm exposure levels, years
of follow-up, and the essential absence of biological effects at the

~ dose levels in the study.

A two-hour general discussion between and among the four guests and Dr.
Durbin followed the building tour. The chief topics discussed were how
to explain the observed differences in the metabolism of the transuranic
elements among species. The usefulness and verifiability of models of
human Pu metabolism were considered at great length, New areas of re~
search in internal emitters problems were considered including the influ-
ence of age on local dose and ultimate biological end-points; the useful~
ness of common experiments with various species particularly those with
known variations in iron metabolism, bone formation rates and liver func-
tion. | :


&

Dr. Durbin proposed a collaborative effort with two skalev's
colleagues. They have collected data on human skeleton wel; , but.
now do not have the time or interest to write up their material. Dr.
Durbin has collected all of the 19th century and early 20th century
human bone weight data and would like to add the modern Russian material
to the set. Dr, Moskalev agreed to propose a joint article with his
colleagues looking towards publication in an international journal. He
sugested that the original data would be forwarded in any case as soon
as it could be copied.

in the late afternoon the visitors toured (briefly) the Bevatron guided
by Ralph Thomas; the californium separation facility guided by Francis
McCarty; and the Hi-lac guided by Al Ghiorso, Dr. Moiseev, who is a
physicist, was very much intrigued by the proposal to make an advanced
scientific instrument by joining the Bevatron and the Hi-lac. Dr, Moska-
lev was not i h rf ked, "physics was not his

“HE a o t might do in the nature
‘of radiobiology experiments with such machines. .

Dr. Hoskaley regretted that it had not been possible to visit with Dr.
“Tobias. sae Gould probably have fit in a few minutes or made arrange-
ments for the following day, but I had run them ragged with sight-seeing
the day before, Monday was very full, and frankly they were exhausted
and needed rest. pwd), They would also have liked to visit the Medical
Services group. Mrs. Low-Beor tried to fill them in on the duties and
routine of that group.

Comments on money, budgets, problems of communication, demands on timc,
such as committees, etc. ran thpough all of the conversations. Dr. Nénot
and Dr. Moiseev spoke English and understood it well. Dr. Nokkalov and
Dr. Nasse understood more English than they could speak. AIL four are
chiefly odcupied with radiation protection aaa eperatly with problems
raised by intcrnal emitters. | Dr. Moskaley is his country's representa-
itive on the ICRP internal dose committee. ‘Theyall, forece, i ete ‘p=

Melides; "ss they were “carelvr“to point out, Pu Tee ‘breeders, hence

‘the overriding interest in Pu and its transplutonium contaminants.

The Russian visitors will be guests of the AEC Division of Biclogy and
Medicine in Washington. (I feel certoin we will receive good marks as
hosts ond as scientists. pwd).

One further point needs to be added. Although nuclear medicine is not

a cuurent specialty in either country, and the use of nuclear medical
techniques, especially as diagnostic tools, is very limited, the two
physicians indicated thay they personally were much interested, and there
was a definite trend in both countries towards more and more use of

such tools, "It is coming", they said.

1, The Soviet delegation to the Second International Congress on Radiation
Protection arrived several days late. As a consequence, the only presen-
tation from the USSR personally attended was a paper: entitled, "Disorders
in Enbryonal Development of Rats after Injection of 131z," by A M Lyaginskayay>
Y D Parev and S x Sinitsyana. Since this same experiment has been conducted
on the human enbryo, there was really nothing new or even interesting ia

3, The most interesting work presented at the meeting from a personal point
of view was that of Professor J Lafuma, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. He is
charged with the responsibility of setting the’ plutdénfum protection’ standards’
and removal techniques after exposure to plutonium for all of France. Lafima's

most impressive work involves the success he has had in removing copious
amounts of plutonium and other transuranium products from humans using DIPA.

4, Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concemed with only
two primary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds.
His studies have sho, of course, that tie earlier treatment is begun the
better the results; but also he has found it easier to decontaminate an
area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to
remove it from the lungs. Lafuma has used intravenous injection exclusively
for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the
transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine, For the treatment
of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DIPA aerosols and injection, He find
his results from injection are better than the use of aerosols, even in lung
decontamination.

3. To the extent that the proper “half-life for lead in man" was discussed,
the consensus appeared to be that (a) the loss rate can not be represented
as a single exponential; (b) the presently available data on baboons and
beagle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of time to provide a
measure of the "last slow rate loss constant"; (c) it is likely that lead
and radium loss rates will differ because of thé selective reutilization of

excess of those that would be used in a western laboratory, These figures i
were undoubtedly meant to impress his western associates. The data he pre-
sented was primarily on Strontium 90, His findings indicated that Strontium
90 was mich more toxic than had been reported anywhere in western literature
and that it was more carcinogenic than has been previously reported. His u
technique was almost exclusively injections of radio nuclides. The control oa
he had on his animals was not explained, but very likely was very poor. He

3. Iwas unaware that research such as he presented was being done in the
USSR. His demonstration was a good piece of scientific work, that is,
his procedures and results in pathological consequences of radioisotopes
fit reasonably well with our procedures and results in the US. He did

fot present anything new tn his paper, and it must certainly reveal
that they are a few years behind the US in biology and radioisotope
studies and applications, They are apparently still testing the toxi-

city of radio elements, which we have already established and accept,

knowing the effects and using them accordingly. In other words, we

are through with his reported work, feeling that it is completed; ap-

parently they are not. Else, they don't yet know the toxicity bound-

to see how much more they can learn, But his paper reveale remarkable

2. It appears to me that the Soviets have a strong tendency toward oxperi-
ments that enable them to study radiation effects on large animals.
They do not seem interested in radiation response — the effect on tissue;
on the other hand, they concern themselves with metabolic effects, which
are important because they are related to the ability to suppress immunity
mechanisms. They stress immunology and transplants.

. The meeting gave me an opportunity to renew my acquaintance with David
*\Shugar of the Warsaw Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Acadeny

of Sciences of Poland. Though a highly competent scientist and a dedi~
cated Communist, Shugar seens to be short of funds. The organizing

. committee of the Congress sent him money to insure his presence at Cortina
i @tAmpezzo. He and his wife drove by automobile from Poland to Italy.

OER Shugar introduced me to one of his students - K L Wierzchowski. In por-

forming the introduction Shugar declared the young man was highly capable
and.bad a brilliant future.

5. The International Committee of Photobiology had an executive committee

meeting at Cortina d'Ampezzo. It was decided to hold a photobiology
symposium in the late summer of 1967 on the Island of Hvar, Yugoslavia.
The symposium will emphsesize photosynthesis.. The general plan calls
for participation by about 100 scientists, with emphasis being placed
on invitations to the younger scientists in the Sov Bloc. ‘he chief
organizer of the forthcoming symposium is Maria Drekulic eG of
Cellular Biochemistry, Institute “Ruajer 2 Boskovic™, Belgrade. .

Did Symposium contributions include significant advancements in research
on controlled thermonuclear reactions that may be useful in determining
the feasibility of initiating uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions solely
without the use of fissionable materials which would produce large anounts,
of energy,.on the order of one kiloton or greater?

‘to the best of my knowledge there was no formal discussion ‘of any
nuclear reactions, as such, The great majority of the material presented
had to do-with biological effects, and the physicists at the Symposium
were using high energy machines largely to produce the radiation that’
would be. conparable to solar flare radiation.

“Was anything Prosented on effects (of space Fadietion on the human body?

speakers confined their references to purely laboratory observations.

T do not ‘recall anyone's discussing drugs—Soviet or other. And I think
that although research’ in drugs is continuing many radiobiologists are
not very optimistic about their value... This is something many of us
have reservations about.

RIOTISUEE OF the Bisloeiesl sT#ecte of Seat, particularly with

respect to distinguishing among the effects of various energies of

neutrons and the techniques for neasuring these energies. I think it
may be safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods
for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons--the
dosimetry of neutrons.’ “In the biological effect, I think they are

way behind us. But they are much involved in the potentials of neutron

irradiation and their objectives are, I am sure, the effects of space

Actually, [V P] Afanastyev, who is a physicist, was even more sophisticated
than Moskalov. Afanas"yev's paper was entiticd "Production and Investiga-

of High Energy". His paper showed that both their production of high
energy protons in the laboratory and the measurements of these protons
with respect to animal work is sophisticated.» They are‘advanced in this.

. I think this is the distinction to be made: they are more advanced in

, the technology of producing high energy radiations and the measurement

of these than they are in biological effects of radiation.

Wes anything reported on “effects of radiation. on non-regenerative tissues ©

The Russians are very much involved in CNS effects of radiation, but they

rortality in dogs, as reported from my laboratory and Brookhaven, is +
around 1. For small animals like mice it is more like three or four. So
there is this discrepancy, and it may be promising for lerge animal
research. Harwell, my laboratory, and the Argonne National Laboratory
near Chicago are now setting up to apply low dose rate neutrons in

sheep. This will be new work: and should have important results.

Mere results presented on cosmic and Van Allon belt radiation effects
on test organisms in such areas as lethal, metabolic, developmental and
genetic?

There was nothing on this as far as I know, except for a paper from the
Donner Laboratory people at the University of California, Berkeley
entitled "Some Biological Effects of 730 Mev Protons". This may
simulate the kind of radiation that occurs in space and this is why
they are playing around with it, you see.

Were .conclusions presented on determining the relative biologic effective-
ness factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear
testing?

Well, this kind of interest is implied in work with neutrons. * With
neutrons there is this question of RBE and it was one of the major
points of discussion at the Symposium.

Did the Soviets say anything bearing on physical measurements of
radiation in space in terns of relative biological effectiveness factor
and implications for future manned space flights?

ALL I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they
are after: good physical measurenents of radiation of a type that
might be anticipated in space.

Was there anything said on mapping and profiles for space radiation?
There was nothing on this. XN

What interest have the Soviets shown in development and testing of nuclear
power: sources for thermionic power generators? Are the Soviets now
applying such generators?

There was nothing on this.

Did the’Soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and
components for application to long space flight electronic equipment?

This Symposium was all biological, so there was nothing on this.

Was there anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding?

"It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about the

investigation of dose fields, the radiation of experimental animals with
protons of high-energy, implies that they would be using some kind of

, Shielding to get the animal exposed. 5

The most interésting aspect of meeting was conduet and contributions of Prof
in'Man; no abstract wes presented. poke

lgucver, he. changed the title to "Problems of Kineticsof Mptake and Retention

of Radioisotopes. uring his presentation, it was suggested that the retention

of multiple dosis of Sr90 in the rat could not be predicted on the basis of

single injection studies, after con! westi wig t ce
he apparently spoke no » We concluded meant by this ie ra’

ts a continually changing aniral. In any event, his paper presented nothing
hew_and could by described as weit ates er_ elementary.
In contrast, Prof Moskalev's questions throughout the four day meeting covered
a wide range of topics, and left one with the impression that he was a competent

individual. In response to questions, however, his answers were far from
satisfactory. He have no specific answers to questions regarding Soviet ex-

perience with radioisotopes in ran.
