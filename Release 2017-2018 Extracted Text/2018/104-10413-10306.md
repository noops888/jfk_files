SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and

Unidentified Man

That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with

the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man"

was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of

"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.

According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the

USSR in 1964; in the U.S. in Otober 1963 .

MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist

and often attends international conferences. He

has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in

the U.s.

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of

"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved

in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:

he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in

Dallas on 20 November.

That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in

Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the

identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been

fingered to him in Mexico City.

---

## Page 7

: 2 -

- that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination

plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed

Kennedy.

that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",

was out of the U.S.

That he used limp as a

disguise.

QUESTIONS

1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?

2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who

boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22

November 1963?

3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without

Cuban knowledge?

RECOMMENDATION

1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he

has delivered speeches at scientific conferences

in U.S. and abroad?

2.

If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)

hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"?

Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN

Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with

him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

SUBJECT:

Possible Identity of the "Unidentified Man"

Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963

REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City

Station

B. Paperback Book "Appointment in Dallas"

C. Soit File, Headquarters Information on

Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALIV, Possible

"Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified nan were taken by

our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going

into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in

Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas.

Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have

appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of

the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in

Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beeni

identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General

Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of

the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met

in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course

there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish

speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cukan grouD.

about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with

. - 2 -

the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same building

in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve

it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB

officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the

West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member

that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

• clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri

was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes

with the Cuban group.

3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an

individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description

of the unidentified man. This lead to an individual by the

name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor

of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international

scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.

Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a

sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service.

Many

of the documents in his dossier are 00 reports from U.S.

scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at

scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater

knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability

is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is

noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.

It is also noted that on

• occasions he reportedly was not

qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference.

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

In December 1963 the FBI reported

In October 1963 MOSKALEV was

delegate

to

the

IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation,

Brookhaven, Long Island,

New York.

Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV

was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made

a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to

radiation

International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

travelled ai

•• Sun Valley and appare. was able to use

his knowledge of the English language to get along on his ow.

Although he complained about not I-nowing much English, he

admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.

MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West •

German scientist.

A respected U.S. scientist said he fran'-ly

did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious

notes on

a11

papers, which indicated he understood what was

going

on .

He also

took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.

From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he new

English quite well. Although considerable time was

spent

arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route

to

his home, he took a different route,

without telling anyone

of his plans, and did not visit the lal.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of

the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared

photos of the unidentified man with photos of My Yuriy

Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI, L

Liaison, and CRS.

It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely ke

identifiable with the unidentified man.

5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an

Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the

author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination

of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code

name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, kears

a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuri! Ivanovich

MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the

picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhil it #237 as

having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,

either in the foyer or just outside.

6. The author of the alormentioned book, Hugh C. MeDonald,

is the inventor of the Identi-kit and at one time was under

contract to CIA in regard to the Identi-Kit. McDonald clims

in his book that he met "Saul" at an office in CIA Headquarters

sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that a colleague

of McDonald told him that "Saul" was an assassin.

7. There are striking parallels between the backgrounds

of "Saul" as given in McDonald's book, and MOSKALEV.

For example:

"Saut"

Pg. T - CIA allegedlj; knew

of Saul. McDonald said he first

met Saul in CIA Has. CIA took

picture of Saul that started

McDonald's investigation.

MOSKAL EV

According to Office of Security,

McDonald has been in touch with

CIA in relation to his Identi-Kit.

His

It is true that Mexico City Station

took photos of "Saul" that McDonald

claimed started his investigation.

P8. 59 - See Identi-Kit

composite of "Saul".

CDH comment: See photos of

Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV. He

bears striking resemblance to

"Saul."

Helms, the DDP testified under oath

that he didn't know "Saul."

Pg. 60/61 - McDonald states it

was obvious that FBI and CIA

were compromised at the very

top since both Agencies denied

knowledge of "Saul". Noone wanted

to hear anymore about him.

gan his senich

of "Saul" in 1970. It began, he

said, with a call from an uniden-

tified woman who arranged a meeting

in London and told him she believed

the Russians had a germ warfare

installation in Vozrozdenya, in

the Aral Sea. McDonald obtained

CIA approval to make contact.

Pg. 70 - In Germany in 1945

McDonald knew of 12 people

(poles, Czechs, Rumanians,

Germans, Scandinavians, 2 Russiaus)

who feared and hated Russia. They

formed org. to observe, analyze,

and report all future activities

within Russia

and Russia sphere

of control. Most had legitimate

jobs.

PE. 71 - 24 Sept 70 McDonald

left for London with "Saul's"

picture. McDonald said both he

and Saul were contract men for

CIA. Saul did dangerous jobs

for private interests.

Pg. 73 - McDonald learned that on

Island of Vozrozdenya, Aral Sea,

germ warfare was being planned

against U.S. (Russians transmit

NOSKALEV was allegedly

he be a double agent?

Pg. 75 - McDonald showed photo

of Saul to man. Man asked if

McDonald's interest had to do

McDonald said no, he wanted to

Pg. 76 - By now McDonald was

sure that "Saul" was reasonably

well-known in highly specialized

NOSKALEY is known in International

circules

co-relation between activity

exact.

Pg. 95 - At hospital he was

orderly by name of Ivan. There

were other young interns,

orderlies, etc., there.

Pg. 99 - Some momths before

Kennedy was killed, an inquiry

was being circulated, about

this man (Saul).

Someone wanted

to contact him. Word went out that

someone needed his services.

Pg. 109 - An alleged former

(McDonald called Kimsey)

Agency employee/said the

scheme which "Saul" described

I to kill the president/

could not possibly have been

activited without help from

very high places

in this country.

(U.S.)

Pg. 117 - Saul did not know he

was being called Saul.

Pg. 119 - Saul told Kimsey that

he often used limp as part of

his disguises.

Pg. 120 - In Zurick in 1972

McDonald saw four men. Three

Arabic and one who had a blunt,

Slavic fact with a broad-typed

nose, about 40.

MOSKALEV's middle name is

Ivanovich; so is BUBNOV's

Could this have been MOSKALEV?

.....

Pg- 121 - Kimsey felt that Saul

was a middle-European, so probably

grew up with German

as second

Language.

"Saul"

spoke English

like an American.

Pg. 143 - "Saul" said he came

back to the U.S. for a short period

one time, lived in Southern

Calif. for about a month, or

six weeks, then moved to Mexico.

Said business was good in Mexico,

and that made

it easy, or easier,

to try to make contact with whoever

was trying to make contact with

him.

Pg. 164 - "Saul":

said a contact he

named Troit would have OSWALD in

Mexico City 26 Sept to 3 Oct.L3)

and that OSWALD would call on

both the Cuban Consul and Soviet!

Consud.

"Saul" said he did not have a

photo of OSWALD but had a contact

in the Soviet Embassy would do

the job (identify OSWALD) for him.

Saul said OSWALD did show up in

Mexico City and was fingered to

him. He sat cloe to him in

restaurans and cafeterias.

MOSKALEV has much greater

knowledge of English than

he pretends or admits. .

OSWALD was in Mexico City

between those dates, and was in

contact with the Cuban and Soviet

Consuls.

McDonald said that as a professional

for the U.S. in Nov 1963 but would

not say how ow where he crossed

"Saul" had to master the art of

the border. On evening of the

crossing borders illegally, so that

20th of Nov he was in Dallas.

no record is kept. False passports

are easiest methods.

Page 177: "Saul" desceibed how

he shot President Kennedy from

2nd story window of County

Records Bldg.,

Page 178:

"Saul" said that he

used "limp" disguise" out of

bldg., and in 2 hours was out of

the U.S.

-

Could "Saul" be mystermy man who

boarded plane for Havana? See

DIRECTOR 36054. Flight from Mexico

City reportedly delayed from 1700 to

2200 hours for passenger who arrived

at 2130.

Page 182: McDonald remembers

"Saul's" statement that long

before the Warren Commission even

existed he had been told that

there was a possibility that

such a

bullet would ke planted

to tie in OSWALD's rifle positively

to the shooting.

It therefore appears that the mere

existence of CE No. 399 tends

io prove the accuracy of "Saul"s

statement and the presence of :!

conspiracy.

and removal techniques after exposure to plutonium for all of France. Lafuma'&

most impressive work Involves the success he has bad in removing copious

amounts of plutonium and other transuranium products from humans using DIPA.

Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concerned with only

two prinary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds.

His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier trcatment is begun the

better the results; but also he has found 1t caster to decontaminate an

area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to

remove It from the lungs.

Lafuma has used

intravenous Injection exclusively

for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the

transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine.

For the treatment

of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DTPA aerosola and

injection.

his results

from Injection are better than the use of aerosole, even 1n luag

To the extent that the proper "half-life for lead in nan" was discussed,

the consensus appeared to be that (a) the loss ratc can not be rcpresented

as a single exponential; (b) the presently available data on baboons and

beagle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of time to provide a

measure of the "last slow rate loss constant"; (c) it is likely that lead

and radium loss rates will differ because of the selective reutilization of

P5 in bone.

D Barltrop (UK) and US researchers have been performing

experiments which indicate that lead is not bound by red cell. membranes,

sites in the cell interior.

2. It appears to me that the Soviets have

a strong tendency toward experi

ments that enable them to study radiation effects on large animals.

They do not seem interested in radiation response - the effect on tissue;

on the other hand, they concern themselves with metabolic effecte; which

are important, because they are related to the ability to suppress Immunity

mechanisms.

They stress Immunology and transplante.

Did Symposium contributions include significant advancements in research

on controlled thermonuclear reactions that nay be useful in determining

the feasibility of initiating uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions solely

without the use of fissionable materials which would produce large amounts.

of energy, on the order of one kiloton or greater?

To the best of my knowledge there was no formal discussion of any

nuclear reactions, as such.

The great majority of the material presented

had to do with biological effects, and the physicists at the Symposium,

were using high energy machines largely to produce the radiation that'

would be comparable to solar flare radiation..

Was anything presented on effects of space radiation on the human body?

I can recall no Soviet references to the Vostok flights.

The

two Soviet

speakers confined their references to purely laboratory observations.

There was a number of US papers, and as

I recall one from France,

oriented to space flight conditions, however..

Were there results in the use of drugs in radiation protection?

charder 270 dad 59r

I do not recall anyone's discussing drugs-Soviet or other.

And I think

that although research in drugs is continuing many radiobiologists are

not very optimistic about their value. This is something many of us

have reservations about.

Was anything presented on the characteristics of a bio-element used for

space radiation detection including the number required for an extended

space probe and the method of transmitting information.

I do not recall any discussion of this by anybody Practically everyone •

There is no conclusion about the

People will argue about it,

sui there is no conclusion. "the Soviets had some things to say about it,

tias thoroughly confused about their position.." There are two ways

o. -uir.ling about the RiE factor.

One is fron the: viewpoint of theoretical

bielory which is interested in the why of differences of biological

afractivoness, and this becones one of the parameters of experiment.

The

otor is the question of an empirical number that one can use in handling

Jur tinno of judgment about radiation exposure in man.

With regard to the

waitions of judgment, I think thai most biologists would agree

that we

We have numbers that

Did thu doviets say anjthing bearing on physical measurements of radia-

tiri in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor and

ivilientions for future manned space flights?

i to sole do a he vect a pale!

Has a frequent commentator

of denigrating the reports

is these people with respect to radiation lethallty.

His comment was to

une arrest that the stucies of radiation lethality done usually in small

inianlo tors not to the point, were not germane to problems in the

trian case, and that to be useful these studies should be done

in animals

closer to man.

What is your critique of his argument?

Joll, a mass of work has been done with the smaller animals in variuos

liboratories and ive are beginning to get certain generalities

nature of radiation injury, or it least certain kinds of radiation i

injury, and therefore I think it is worthwhile to pursue it.:" As you

liagine, I presented a paper on radiation lethality and was among

tidie to whose work Moskalev objected.

o wink Moskalen's objections here motivated from anything more thai

a genuine scientific position?

so can say? In their published work the Soviets show a lot of attention

to effects in the central nervous system-they are very interested in

this and US people have tended to ignore this area.. So conceivably:

cockalsv is oriented to CiS work and physiological functions, I do not

but quite a lot of the Sovist work las a different orientation;

In auscussion.

Indicated that lic was very sharp.

knovledge of the biological effects of radiation, particularly with

respect to distinguishing among the effects of various energies of

neutrons and the techniques for reasuring these energies.

I think it

may be safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods

for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons--the

dosintry of neutrons. In the biological effect, I think they are

way behind us.

But they are much involved in the potentials of neutron

irradiation and their objectives are, I am sure, the effects of space

radiation

on human beings.

for Irradiation of Ixperimental Animals with Protons

of High Energy".

His paper showed that both their production of high

energy protons in the laboratory and the measurements of these protons

with respect to animal work is sophisticated. They are 'advanced in this.

I think this is the distinction to be made: they are more advanced in

the technology of producing high energy radiations and the measurement

of these than they are in biological effects of radiation.

lo Was anything reported on effects of radiation on non-regenerative tissues

such as the brain?

Áo

The Russians are very much involved in CNS effects of radiation, but they

presented no data at the Symposium.

survey of Russian research work on biological actio

27.

data on the production of dose fields with high energy protons.

One, gets the impression that whereas Russians physics is mechanistic

and quite indistinguishable fron ours in that respect,

Russian biology

is impregnated with philosophy.

doskalev. for example, spoke of how

• the body

"adapts" to radiation in the sense that a single animal adapts.

Most, biologists will reserve this vord to changes in a species over a

very long period. I suppose you could consider wound healing as

adaptation in a sense. But wester biology: sees certain events:

occuring in an organism as the consequence: ofin wound which can be

described withuut resort to notims of teleological adaptation.

This

philosophical tendency has been a damaging element in Russian biology,

I believe.

28. Qo. Here there results in the use

of drugs in radiation-protection?

•ine

A.

I can, recall nothing on protective drugs from'anybody.

There was here

and there a reporting of drugs used to enhance the effect of radiation

with respect to tumor treatment..

29% Go:

Was anything presented on the characteristics of a bio-element used for

space radiation detection including the number required for an extended •

space probe and the method of transmitting information?

A.

I am afraid I do not understand the question.

30. Q.

l'as there anything on biological indicators at

Low ranges of radiation

doses?.

A.

There is a tremendous amount of interest in such indicators everywhere.

so presumably they are not concerned with these.

Piople from other countries, and particularly the US, reported work

irving to do with low dose effects and reliable biological indicators

for low ranges of dose using the chromosome aberration methods in human

.calls. but the Russians had nothing to say about this particular thing

ind seem not to be working on it as yet.

In your opinion; what is the level of accomplishment, worldwide, in this

Matter of getting reliable indicators of biological damage?

Insofar as I know, the most sensitive and reliable biological index for

smare at low dose rates involves the study

of chromosome abnormalities.

Tie approach was developed in the US and is being used extensively here

and in england, and ether countries are taking it up Moreover, I tbiTik.

and particularly the us

and England are very much in the fore

From shat I know of Russian radi biology from

translations and

exclude their reiated

physical work from this judgment.

33. Q-

Has there reporting from the Soviets on types of radiation detection

equipment used in the Vostok flights?

Did they report findings

on the

rulativa biological effectiveness factor values for neutrons, protons

and cosmic ray attenuations?

Hell, errin, there was no specific mention of this, but the interest in

the rolative biological effectiveness factor for neutrons and cosnic

was a major concer of the whole Symposium:

the attempt to

slucidute the IBE factor and particularly the problem with respect to

there is this discrepancy, and it may be pronising for large animal

neutrons there is this question of REE and it was one of the major

points of discussion at the Symposium.

39. Q. Did the Soviets

anything bearing on physical measurements of

radiation in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor

and implications for future manned space flights?

Ao

All I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they

are after:

good physical measurements of radiation of a type that

might be anticipated in space.

40. Qo Was there anything said on mapping and profiles for space radiation?.

i. A. There was nothing on this.

41. Q. What interest have the Soviets shown in development and testing of nuclear

power sources

for thermionic power generators?

Are the Soviets now

applying such generators?

A. There was nothing on this.

42. Q. Did the Soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and

components for application to long space flight

electronic equipment?

1. This Symposium was all biological, so there was nothing on this.

13: Q. Was thare anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding?

.. No.

It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about the

of dose fields, the radiation of

experimental

protons of high energy, implies that they would be using some kind of

shielding to get the animal exposed.

44. Q.

This contribution would have been in Afanas"yev's paper "Production and

Investigation of Dose Fields for Irradiation.

with Protons of High Energy"?

Aa. Yes.
