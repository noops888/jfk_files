(FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

‚Soviet Officials' Statements

About NOSENKO

The portialt of NOSENKO which emerges from Soviet

officials'

statements about him since his defection coin-

cides markedly with NOSENKO's self-description. According

to the comments of Soviet officials, principally intelli-

gence officers most likely to be speaking authoritatively,

defecror NOSENKO was

the son of the deceased ilinister, he

served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings

were overcome

through the patronage of KGB General GRIBANOV,

and in connection witü operations against Americans he

occupied positions of progressively greater trust and

responsibility, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of the

largest department in the key Second (Counterintelligence)

Chief

Directorate. According to these sources, his defection

wrought

severe damage "for years to come" to the kGB

because of his knowledge of KGB

operations against American

targets, and his treachery prompted

the

expulsion and

disgrace of numerous senior KGB personnel, the recall of

many others from abroad, the virtual suspension of KGB

operations in the United

States, and extraordinary plans to

assassinate him.

These statements are related in chronological order in

completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall of 1943

NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory

After just six months in Baku, without completing the

Comment: (Continued)

After NOSENKO's defection was publicized,

Soviet Naval defector ARTAMONOV volunteered

to CIA that he had known the son of the

Minister NOSENKO in the naval school in

Leningrad from 1944 to 1946.

NOSENKO completed the Tenth Class at the Leningrad Ship-

building Tekhnikum in June 1945, and he

successfully passed

the necessary examinations to qualify him for entrance to

the Moscow Institute of International

Relations that summer.

Birth to 1945: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on

his early life. However,

this portion of his claimed

biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-

abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time of his

father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the

schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics

(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and

formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of

which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's

claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO

and the substance of his claims about his life until 1945

are accepted as true.

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute

course was of four years' duration and that he entered

the

Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'

duration and that because he

failed a state examination

he

was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'

duration and he graduated in 1950, on schedule; and that it

was of five years' duration but he failed an examination

which delayed his graduation for three months.

Comment:

See p. 367 for report that NOSENKO joined the KGB

upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.

The duration of the Institute course and the

date of NOSENKO's completion are material to

the pinusibility of his claimed Naval RU service,

which he said followed almost immediately upon

his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at

the Institute of International Relations he entered the

Naval RU, serving in the Far Fast and then in a Baltic post,

finally successfully "transferring" to the KGB through the

intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOV.

The significance of NOSENKO's RU service is the fact

that he claims it launched his intelligence career and

served as the means through which he

secured appointment

to the KGB after once having been rejected. The two or more

years he claimed to have served in the RU represent a

have no difficulty accounting. Finally, the date of his

can be judged credible.

NOSENKO volunteered extensive comment on his Naval RU

service at his first meetings with CIA

in 1962. After his

1964 defection, it was the topic on which he made one of

his initial retractions and his first admission that he had

earlier made a false claim.

The KGB considered PREISFREUND compromised to American

SHAKHOV "mayhe" häd some contact with MARK in 1960 or 1961,

but NOSENKO did not know the substarce of it.

A countor-

intelligence officer of the First Chief Directorate, S.M.

GOLUBEV, had once been on a delegation with SHAKHOV and he

had noted "little details".

While SHAKHOV was in the United

States, earlier, he had been terminated (as an agent) by

KGB officers who had

NOSENKO stated that SHAKHOV had served with the Ministry

of Foreign Affairs in the United States and that during that

service he acted as an agent-recruiter for the KGB. SHAKHOV

was permitted to travel abroad even though suspected of being

an American agent, because he belonged to the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs,

and "the KGB could do nothing about his

trips abroad'.

"There was no proof, only suspicions, and

furthermore,

SHAKHOV was a member of the personal

staff of

the head of the Soviet delegation, S.K. Isarapkin."

According

to NOSENKO, SHAKIIOV was not and never had been a KGB officer.

Comment:

SHAKHOV has served in and visited the United

States since 1942, when he was assigned to the

Soviet Consulate General in New York.

He at

tended the 1945 Conference on International

Organization in San Francisco, and he had at-

tended

a number of sessions of the UN General

Assembly. Most recently SHAKHOV was assigned!

to the U.S. in 1963 as a member of the soviet

Mission to the UN. KGB officer RASTVOROV Iden-

tified him as an MVD (KGB] officer whom he is

certain he saw at MVD Headquarters in Moscow,

identified him as

"an emplovee of the

KGB": and KGB

defectors PETROV and DERYABIN

have reported that from a photograph, SHAKHOV's

"was familiar'.

An FBI source, however,

in 1964 said that SHAKHOV was a 'pure diplomat"

and that to his knowledge, SHAKHOV had engaged

in no soviet intelligence

activity until that

time.

NOSENKO described the various ways he had tested suspicions

of SHAKHOV in Geneva.

He gave SHAKHOV disinformation and then

watched

for an indication that he passed it on to his American

contacts.

SHAKHOV was told to perform countersurveillance

tasks during a meeting by NOSENKO with an imaginary agent,

while other KGB officers checked for signs that SHAKHOV had

forewarned the Americans about the meetirg.

Finally NOSENKO

turned to KGB Headquarters from Geneva.

In Geneva, he and TSYMBAL had

dinner together several times

NOSENKO's Information

SLESINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First

Chief Directorate because of his business transactions

with a number of Soviets who visited his store and in

whom he seemed to show more than

casual interest.

The

First Chief Directorate

was of the opinion that

SLESINGER was trying to become closely acquainted with

some Soviets, to study them.

SLESINGER had visited the

Soviet Union

several times.

Learning SLESINGER planned

another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that "he

might make some contacts or do something interesting"

while visiting the Soviet Union.

The KGB wanted to

resolve its suspicions that SLESINGER was possibly an

agent or operational contact of the FBI.

The KGB had

a file on SLESINGER, and a senior case officer in the

American Section of

the Seventh Department, Yu. M.

DVORKIN, was the responsible case officer.

An agent

of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo

graphic shop in Moscow was instructed to become friendly

with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet

Union, and the two men later exchanged correspondence.

SLESINGER went to Odessa to visit relatives, and DVORKIN.

directed the Odessa KGB to. "surround" him with agents. who

could watch his behavior.

If there had been any indication

of intelligence activities, the KGB would have attempted

to recruit SLESINGER, but since no evidence was developed,

no approach was made.

SLESINGER had travelled to the

Soviet Union before, several times.

Comment:

A sensitive source

had reported to the

FBI that the KGB

suspected SLESINGER to

be an FBI "plant"

and that KGB officer

• "might be trying to develop

SLESINGER to act as a courier or in some

other agent capacity."

NOSENKO's information was substantially

correct.

Alfred Lazarevich SLESINGER,

reported to the FBI in July 1962 of his

June 1962 visit to Moscow and Odessa.

In Odessa SLESINGER was contacted by a

KOTEN was a longtime member of the American Communist

to the Soviet Union, where he had extensive contacts among

dissident literary figures and other Soviet citizens,

particularly among Russian Jews.

INOSENKO explained

in

another context that the KGB is wary of foreigners' contacts

with Soviet Jews because the Israeli Intelligence Service

has freguently inspired such contacts.] Because of these

many suspicious contacts, both the KGB First and

Directorates had concluded that (KOTEN) might be a "provocation

NOSENKO's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex-

traction, a Russian speaker, and a university professor

in New York City.

SHUBIN, who had visited the Soviet

Union twice before, visited the Soviet Union in 1958

or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour of

duty in

the Seventh Department. At that time, SHUBIN

was the target of Seventh Department case officer

A.A. VETLITSKIY, NOSENKO heard later that SHUBIN was

placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance

observed SHUBIN as a passenger in a llinistry of Defense

automobile, the GRU was asked about the American.

"They

very furtively said that they were interested in him,"

from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

In 1962 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign

visitors to the Soviet Union and he noted SHUBIN's name

and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.

NOSENKO himself telephoned GRU General SOKOLOV's office

and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according

to another version, SOKOLOV's office was advised by

others).

SOKOLOV's office eventually apologized for

having failed earlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's

interest in SHUBIN.

a sensitive source

Comment: Earlier,

no identified al

agent apparently identical with SHUBIN

and FBI sources reported SHUBIN's travel

to the USSR in summer 1961 and in

September 1963.

SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport

between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited

the Soviet Union during that period it was

not as an American tourist under his true

name.

Consequently, he could not then have

been the tourist target of the Seventh

Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.

If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring

to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further

contradiction: NOSENKO could not have

noticed his name while reviewing tourist

lists in the Seventh Department, because

he claims he was in the American Department

at the time.

area was covered with

very deep

woods, "where a person could lose himself for life". On the

seventh day CHEREPANOV was located and arrested in

where he was on his

Baku,

way to the Iranian border.

A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, carrying

S.M. FEDOSEYEV and several other American Department offi-

cers.

They brought CHEREPANOV immediately back to Moscow,

interrogating him on the plane. He immediately confessed

to having given the documents to the Americans. when asked

why, he said he was

"angry at the KGB, very angry", and

besides, he thought he might ask the Americans for some

money in return for the documents.

4 November he had passed the documents to an American tourist

who was a librarian interested in Russian books.

He said he

had given the documents to the American in the entrance

hallway in the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

the building in which the Ministry of Foreign Trade was also

housed.

Because CIIEREPANOV had eluded the KGB between the two

fixed surveillance posts which had been established, the

Second Chier Directorate suffered considerable criticism

for not putting CHEREPANOV under full, round-the-clock

surveillance.

CHEKEPANOV himself, however, told the KGB

that if he had detected his surveillants he would have

written

to the government

and newspapers a letter of protest

against "such an indignity, such persecution", and then

would have committed suicide, leaving the KGB

without proof

The Recall Telegram

NOSENKO's Information

On 3 February 1964, MOSENKO claimed, he visited the KGB

Legal Residency once during the morning before he met with

CIA and again that evening after 1800; there were at those

times no KGB telegrams concerning him.

On the morning of

4 February he again stopped in at the

Residency, but there

were again no such messages for him.

Later in

the morning

of 4 February, however, after attending a session of the

Disarmament Conference, he returned to the Residency and

tound that a telegram from KGB Headquarters had arrived,

instructing him to return to Moscow immediately to partici-

pate in the KGB conference on tourism.

NOSENKO'S Eventual Retraction Regarding Recall Telegram

NOSENKO maintained throughout his interrogations

in 1964 and 1965 that there was the recall telegram

and that

it prompted his defection.

In October 1966, however, while

being questioned again, NOSENKO stated that there had bee::

no telegram recalling him to Mosco? from Geneva, and he

signed the following statement:

"On 4 February 1964, I told my CIA contact

in Geneva

that a telegram from Headquarters in

Moscow had been received in the KGB Residency in

Geneva recalling me immediately to Moscow.

I said

at the time that this telegram said that I was

recalled to participate in a conference to plan KGB

activity against tourists for the 1964 season.

maintained this story as fact throughout subsequent

interviews and interrogations by American authorities

in 1964 and 1965.

No such telegram ever existed.

No telegram was received in Geneva. I admit that

the story was a lie.

I myself invented this tele-

gran in order to hasten my defection.

I was nervous

and afraid that my contacts with American Intelli-

gence might be noticed."

Knowledge of Other Seventh Department Operations

The notes NOSENKO brought to CIA in Geneva in 1964

(see p.319) included brief

reference to thirteen other KGB

operations conducted against what NOSENKO described as

tourists during

the 1962-1963 period. For reasons cited

in the description of these operations

in Annex B, these

operations are not material to MOSENKO's claim to service

in 1962-1963

as cither Chief of the American-British

Commonwealth Section or as Deputy Chief

of the Seventh

Department.

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January, 1962-January 1964)

Operational Activities - July 1962-January 1964: Summary

To substantiate his claims to having served as Deputy

Chief of the Seventh Department during this period, NOSENKO

describes KGB involvement in the recruitment of SVENCHANSKIY

the arrests of KOTEN and BARGHOORN, and the investigations

Of SLESINGER, OSWALD, and of former KGB officer CHEREPANOV,

his discovery that SHUBIN was a GRU agent, and his agsignment

to Geneva.

Even if NOSENKO learned of the operations as

he described and they were as he described (there are substan-

tial reasons why they might have been conducted by KGB

elements other than the Seventh Department), they are atypical

with respect to NOSENKO's own description of Seventh Depart-

ment

operations. They do not accurately characterize, as

NOSENKO claims, KGB counterintelligence operations against

tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventh Department

service.

NOSENKO's explanations for his assignment to

Geneva in 1964 are no more plausible than for his earlier

assignment there in 1962. NOSENKO has asserted that he was

not a lieutenant colonel

as the temporary duty authorization

indicated, but a captain, a rank incongruous with a Deputy

Chief of Department and one from which he presumably would

have been promoted as he assumed the senior KGB positions

which he claimed to have held.

SUMMARY OF CONCUUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in

successively senior positions of authority from which he

derived extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and

results of KGB operations against Americans in the Soviet

Union in the period 1953-1963. To substantiate his claim,

he provides an impressive array of information about KGB

personnel, organization and operations which, to the extent

that it has been

confirmed, is presumptive evidence of his

bona fides.

Various Soviet officials, including intelli-

gence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO' g

claims.

According to some of these sources, NOSENKO waS

à senior KGB officer who occupied a series

of sensitive

positions, who enjoyed considerable authority and trust

despite personal shortcomings, and whose defection,

"the

greatest loss ever suffered by Soviet Intelligence"

paralyzed the work of

KGB

The examination has compared each element of NOSENKO's

biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known

facts and reasonable surmise.

The examination reflects

the test to which his accounts were put:

whether his

accounts are internally coherent and consistent with known

fact, and whether he

actually gained the information he has

from occupying the KGB positions he claims to have held.

In short, is he what he says he is, according to his own

accounts?

to meet JOHNSON on the street rather

than in various restaurants as had been their habit.

At one

of their final meetings before JOHNSON returned to the United

States, VLASOV told JOlNSON that a Soviel Intelligence officer

had defected to the Americans in Geneva, and that extreme

caution must therefore be exercised in JOHNSON's contacts

with the KGB. VLASOV said that the defector could not identify

JOHNSON but that JOHNSON should alapose of everything he had

According to a sensitive source from a KGB officer

The KGB. was lucky that the Americans found only

microphones in the Ü.S. Embassy in Moscow.

Actually,

about 200 microphones were concealed by the Soviets in the

Embassy: NOSENKO was responsible for furnishing information

tö the Americans which resulted in the microphones being

found. NOSENKO knew only the general location of the 40

microphones which were found and does not have any knowledge

of the remaining ones.

1.2 June

Professor John M. THOMPSON reported at the American

Embassy' in Moscow that an unnamed Soviet official with whom

he was acqualnted told him that NOSENKO was a profligate

with two wives and many debts and la considered 1n

to be someone they are well itd of.

According to a sensitive source

The consensus among KGB employees

i s

that in the future the KGB will be feeling sharply the

effects of NOSENKO's escape

to American Intelligence.

NOSENKO is considered to be vastly

more important than either

GOLIISYN Or DERYABIN. This opinion appears to be based on

several factors:, First, NOSENKO worked against personnel

stationed at the American Embassy in Moscow

and: with his

agents were developed among these Americans.

second, It is

assumed by KGB personnel that because of his closeness to

the American Embassy in the past, NOSENKO would also be

familiar with the number of

microphones which had been

Installed in the

Embassy by the KGB'

and the locations of

these microphones.

Third, as a Deputy Chiaf of a depart-

ment, NOSENKO would normally have had

access to a telephone

directory 11501ng all personnel in all directorated of the

KGB In Moscow. Another factor, which

is a formidable one

1n the minds of other KGB employees, is that NOSENKO

travelled in a rather influential circle of friends in

Moscow who were high in the Soviet Government.

All these

comments were cited as reasons for NOSENKO being an

"important catch"

for American Intelligence, but no one in

the kCB really knows exactly how much information NOSENKO

had concerning the köB.

29 June 1964

• GULIISYN (fron personal acquaintance): NOSENKO, the son

and had seen him occasionally at work during 1958 and 1959.

When COLITSYN asked him where he was working in 1959, NOSENKO

replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.

NOSENKO served in the American Embaesy Section from 1953.

until 1957 oi 1958, and was specifically responsible for

According

RP (from unnamed

sources, presumably KGB officers

An Investigating commission of the

CPSU Centräl Committee checking into the circumstances

surrounding NOSENKO's defection has thus far been responsible

for the expulsion from the KGB of 15 Second Chief Directorate

employees.

Thes: Include GRIBANOV, who was also expelled

from the CPSU and was

stripped of his rank of lieutenant

general. GRIBANOV has been given a very small pension, like

an ordinary soviet ritizen.

This drastic action was taken

since the primary responsibility for the defection was placed

on GRIBANOV.

It was realized that, in addition to being Chief

of the Second Clilef Directorate at the time of the defection,

GRIDANOV was a personal filend of NOSENKO and had more or :

less treated NOSENKO as a protege and had taken many steps

to further NOSENKO's career within the KGB..

It was

felt

that GRIBANOV should have been aware of NOSENKO's plans to

defect.

Three of GRIBANOV's deputles were also expelled

from the KGB,

one of whom was a Major General BANNIK

(BANNIKOV].

Of the 11 other Second Chlet Directorate employees

expelled, some

were found to have been personal frienda of

NOSENKO and some of them were found to have confided to NOSENKO

details of operations in which they were working. S.M. GOLUBEV,

in Washington, would be leaving for

reccived in the Residentura the morning of the same day he met his

CIA contacts and stated he had defected.

In October 1906, NOSENKO respoaded to a casual mention of

the "recall telegram" with a complete recraction of hia provious state-

ments on the subject. NOSENKO stated, and has

subsequintly maintained,

that there was not a "recall telegram." He has explained that he invented

the "recall telegram'' matter because he was concerned about his personal

safety in rcmaining "in place" for à longer time. NOSENKO has stated

he thought the aliged "recall telegrar" would be accepted by CiA as

à logical reason ior his precipitate decection.

how an officer in the SCD would obtain the telephore number of an

FCD officer, gave a dutailed report including information that there

was at least one complete SCD telephone directory in each room

occupied by SCD officers, In addition, NOSENKO stated he had access

to a directory which was maintained in the office of the Chief of the

Department and which listed the KGB officers down to Section Chiefs

in the various geographical Directorates throughout the USSR.

It is interesting to note that there is a discrepancy between the

since @Wait could hardly give an accurate description of a telephone

directory which he had never seen.
