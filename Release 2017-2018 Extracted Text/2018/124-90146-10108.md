its prime activity during its lifetime had been sponsor-
ship of pro-CASTRO street rallies and mass Picket dines,

and the direction of an active prepegands mili highlighting
illegal travel-to-Ccuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief
span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTHO American
public cpinion, the 19€2 Congressional hearings which dis-
closed FPCC financing ty CASTRO's. United Nations Delegation,

The Novemher 23, 19€3, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
the CASTRO network in the United States." Tb is to be noted

Subconmlttee which twice conducted heurings on the FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "the New York
_-~ World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-
CASTRO FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that
its prime activity during its lifetime had keen sponsor-
ship of pro-CASTRO street rallies and mass pickst lines,
and the direction of an active prepaganda mili highlighting
illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief
span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTRO American
public opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which dis-
closed FPCC financing, ty CASPRO's United Nations Delegation,
and ultimately. the bad publicity which the FPCC received
from diselesure of activities on its behalf by suspected
presidential assassin, LEE H. OSWALD. :

on February 6, 1964,.the previously mentioned
secone source advised that V. T, LEE had recently remarked

organize ‘another similar organization.

On April 13, 1 » a third source advised that:
there had not been any FPCG activity in many months and
that the FPCC had been diesoived.
