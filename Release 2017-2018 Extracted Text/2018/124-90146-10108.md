APPENDIX

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York

Times" newspaper contained

a full-page advertisement

captioned "What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

This advertise-

ment announced the formation of the RPCC in New york city

ana declared the EPCC intended to promulgate "the truth

about revolutionary Cuba" so neutralize the distorted

American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 1l,

1961,' reported that at a hearing conducted before the

United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on

January 10, 1961, Dr. CHARTES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified

himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC. He

also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the Cuban

Government which were applied toward the cost of the afore-.

mentioned advertisement. U

On May 16, 1953; a source advised that during

the first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a

struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the FPCC

and thereby influence FPCC policy. This source added that

during the past year there had been a successful effort by

FPCC leadership to minimize the role of these and other

ory,120 a meet that their influence as of

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive order 10450. U

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then

formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

intention of permitting FPCS polley to be determined by

any other organization. This source stated that LiE

belleved that the FPCC should advocate resumption of

diplonatic relations between Cuba and the United states

and should support the right of Cucans to manage their

revolution without Interference from other nations.

APFENDIX

FAIR PLAY FOR CUISA COMMITTRE

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New Yor!:

Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the CASTRO network in the United States."

It is to be noved

that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate internal Security

subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the FPoC.

The December 27, 1953, edition of "The New Voik

World Telegram and Sun"

newspaper stated thet the pro-

CASIRO FFCC was seeking to go out of business and that

its prime activity during its iifetime had been sponsor-

ship or pro-CASIRo strees rallied and nass picket lines,

and the direction of an active propagande im highlighting

span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTRO American

sublic opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which dis-

closed FPCC financing by CASTRO's United Nations Delegation,

and ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received

from discosure of activities on its behalf ky suspected

presidential assassin, LiE H. OSWALD. U

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned

second source advised

that V.

T. LEE had recently remarked

that the EPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization. U

on April 13, 1964, a third source adulied that

there had not been any HICC activity in many months aud

that the FPCC had been dissolved.

APPENDIX

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTES

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York

Times" newspaper contained a full-page advertisement

captioned "What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by

the Fair. Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

This advertise

ment announced the formation of the FPCC in New York City

and declared the FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth

about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize the distorted

American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11,

1961, reported that at a hearing conducted before the

United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on

January 10, 1961, Dr. CHARTES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified

himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC.

also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the Cuban

Government which were applied toward the cost of the afore-

mentioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during

the first two years of the FPCCis existence there was a

oể the

struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the FPCC

and thereby influence FPCC policy, This source added that

during the past year there had been a successful effort by

FPCC leadership to minimize the role of these and other

organizations in the FPCC so that their influence as of

May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has heen designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director,

was then

formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by

any other organization.

This source stated that LEE

belleved that the FPCC should advocate resumption of

diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States

and should support the right of Cubans to manage their

revolution without Interference from other nations.

LEE

did not advocate supporting the cuban revolution per se.
