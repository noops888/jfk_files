SUBjECT: Allegation by Thomas HOLT regarding the Assassination of President Kennedy

On October 3, 1978, Inspector Donald Clements and I were interviewing

Thomas HOLT regarding an integrity matter. During a rambling discourse

on his bellef that the drug traffic 1s a hammoth conspiracy headed by

• DEA, HOLT mentioned that he was acguainted with Frank STURGIS of kaiergate

potoriety. HOLT stated that STURGIS once toid him (in the presence of

one Bill JOHNSON) that he (STURGIS) had killed President John F. Kennedy.

When asked why STURGIS would impart this interesting bit of news to a

known government witness, HOLT replied that it was said by "one hit

men to another."

2, STURGIS' alleged Involvement in the late President's assassination

has been widely reported by the news media.

HOLT had previously stated

his Intention to go to the news media regarding his allegations against

DEA, Therefore, he 1s likely to mention the STURGIS allegation as

well. Assuming that he would also tell them that he had reported the

allegation to two DEA Inspectors, I feel this memo 18 necessary.

3.

Should another government agency wish to pursue HOLI's allegation,

he said he was willing to meet with JOHNSON and discuss the batter on

rape to corroborate STURGIS"

statement.
