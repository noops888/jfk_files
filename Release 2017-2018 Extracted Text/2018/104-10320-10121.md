Working Arrangements for the Warren Commission Investigation

The ESCA Report fails to describe the working arrangements
for the ‘conduct of the Waren Commission inquiry. such an
understanding is basic to any interpretation of what did and
did not happen during the inquiry. :

Following the assassination of President Kennedy, President
Johnson designated the Federal Bureau of Investigation as
the principal investigative arm of the Government to investigate the
assassination. This was a logical step as the Bureau had
the largest body of trained investigators. The role of the
Bureau continued in this respect during the Warren Commission
inquiry. he Commission, which had a much smaller staff,
relied extensively on the Bureau for the exhaustive investigation
that was conducted.

As testified ‘to by Mr. Helms, as‘ cited in the BSCA
Report, CIA considered itself responsive to Warren Commission
initiatives. In addition to Mr. Helms‘ testimony, howewer,
the record shows that CIA took a number of initiatives on’)
its own in collecting information and reporting directly to.
the Commission, Consistent with the understood arrangements ©
Of the time, hoWawar, CIA reported the detailed information
that it had to the FBI in the latter's role ash investigative
arn of the Warren Commission. This involved both quality

reporting and a great dross of material that. ordinarily

might not be considered worth reporting. A consideration raised
here is that intelligence analysts routinely winnow out

useless and marginal reports to avoid flooding the recipients
with unevaluated trash. That the HSCA has taken issue with

so few instances of non-disseminated material indicates that

the practice worked well in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. [rp this respect the PBI and the CIA worked closely

together. There are a number of instances in which initial
reporting by CIA was the subject of an investigative follow-

ded to Bureau reque:

up by the Bureau, just as CIA respor ts.

This constituted something of a team operation, providing
the available information at that time to the Warren Commission
HSCA investigators seem to have treated the work of the

Bureau and CIA as separate from one another, jeriticizing CIA
for not conducting investigations that obviously were conducted

by the FBI \

As testified to by the Deputy Director of Central

Intelligence, in his testimony before the HSCA, CIA is not

an investigative agency in the usual sense of the tern.

While it does collect information abroad, its sources are

carefully selected for their potential access to very specialized
and sharply focused subject matter. Those resources are not
readily subject to redirection for the purpose of police~

type investigations. Further, CIA's representatives abroad

While the HSCA did consider the question of how such an

it was done under the arrangements actually in effect at the time.

Comments on Findings of the Committee

At page 12 in the Findings and Recommendations of

the Committee, Section I, D.4., there is a stark statement
that OLA "was deficient in its collection and sharing of
information both prior to and subsequent to the assassination.”
The unqualified nature of that finding conveys impressions

that are subject to disagreement. The Committee is entitled

to its conclusions, but by the same token, the Agency is
entitled to express its reservations about then. For instance,
as a comment at this point, what CIA could be expected to do
prior to the assassination is an interesting question in
itself, which the stark statement handles simplisticaliy-

phe fact is that CIA had no advance information of any sort

on the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas.

At page 24 of the Report, in the Section discussing the
structure of the investigation, the Committee observes that
its ‘access "was unprecedented by any congressional committee
Of course, the permanent oversight committees, which have
institutionalized: security procedures, have similar access.) _

It is more correct that no special investigative

committee has had similar access in the past.

Comments on Nosenko

At page 86 the HSCA Report observes that “strangely,
while (Nosenko) was.interrogated during this period (1964~
1968) he was questioned very little about Oswald.“ Without
defending the mistreatment of Nosenko or the mistakes in the
handling of his case, this aspect has an easily understandable
rationale, which was offered to the Committee. As the
Committee omitted reference to it. it is repeated here

One of the problems with what Nosenko said had arisen
out of inconsistencies as to what he knew about Oswald,
complicated by the question as to whether he was a bona-fide
defector or a dispatched agent. It was not judged profitable
to belabor the Oswald issue and the decision was taken to
try to resolve the question as to whether or not he was a
bona-fide defector. If he was determined to be a bona-fide
defector, then the significance of his inconsistent statements
was reduced to the question of the reliability of what any,
efector ‘says in the early days of his defection. 1E,he was
determined.tto not be a bona-fide defector, then the significance
of ‘those inconsistencies would assume major proportions. -

The problem was reported to Chief: Justicé Warren at’ the
time and ‘as thé question was not resolved during the Warre
Comaission inquiry, Nosenko's testimony was not used.

Had it been: used it would have tended to reinforce the
findings of the Warren Commission that there was no evidence

of Soviet involvement. E 3456

Comments ‘on _ANLASH

At pagés. 89-94 the HSCA Report discusses what is
known as the AMLASH operation. It also discusses a study
written in CIA in 1977 referred to in the HSCA Report as

the CIA Task Force Report. First, there are certain things

that should be understood about the AMLASH operation. While

the HSCA investigators read the 1977 CIA Task Force Report,
they apparently. did not appreciate a key consideration to
how the operation was handled during the life of President
Kennedy.

Both the Eisenhower and the Kennedy Administrations had
major programs aixed at the overthrow of Fidel Castro's
government. Not. only did this. involv ‘support of the Bay! of

Pigs/invasion attempt, it involved economic and political

“sanctions and. government-wide programs directed at subversion

and clandestine activities in Cuba. \It'was in this context

that AMDASE/4, as one Of ‘a: number of Cubans; ‘was contacted

iin) “The reaction of CIA was'that, Because of the important

position held by the man in the\Castro government, he represented

a contact with considerable potential, which should be exploited

if possible. However, thé‘assessment ‘of the man was that he

was not stable and not. subject to discipline of the sort

‘xequixed ‘for 4 recruited agent.»

The decision wz. ~aken that the man could not be dealt
with as a principal agent and that an attempt would have to
be made to find someone in his organization with whom the

ip could be established. ‘The

necessary agent relations|
problem thus became one of how to maintain the contact with

a

man who claimed to have the organizatio:

and weaponry to
carry out a coup, while at the same time developing a way of
taking advantage of whatever eventuated.

The record is unequivocal in the conditional approach

that was settled upon for dealing with the man. He would be
told that he would be given no advance support and that only

if he succeeded in a coup would he receive support. This
position was given him on 29 October 1963. Subsequent reporting
from FBI and CIA sources made it clear that the man. understood
that he had been rebuffed and that he was outraged. It was
clear that if CIA did not want to lodse the contact, which

had as yet to be developed into anything tangible, steps

had to be taken to mollify

The purpose of this summary is simply to point out. the

tenuous nature of the relationship of AMLASH/1 during the

life of the President. This tenuous quality was deliberately

because of the assessment of the ability of the Agency to wo:

the'man. As amatter of fact, the Agency never did develop
a firm relationship with the man although it did provide
what was intended to appear. to him as tokens of its support
in the form of weapons.

Consistent with its original assessment of the man, CIA
put AMLASH in touch with a Cuban exile leader, with whom

the Agency had a viable operational relationship. It was

hoped that through the Cuban exile leader and his organization

AMLASH/1 might come to fit into some future plan.

1977 CIA Task Force Report

At pages 90-92, the HSCA Report misrepresents the 1977
CIA Task Porce Report.

As stated in the HSCA Report, CIA responded to Book V
of the Church Committee Report by conducting an internal
inquiry. Essentially, the key consideration, so far as this
internal inquiry was concerned, was the significance of what
has come to be known as the “provocation theory," i.e., CIA
plotted the assassination of Castro, Castro might have

learned of it, he might have dispatched assassins to kill

esident Kennedy in retaliation. As the provocation theory
applied especially to Cuba, the focus of the study was on CIA's
Cuban operations.

The provocation theory had not been perceived in 1964
during the Warren Commission investigation. The various

aspects of the tensions between the Kennedy Administration

and the Castro Regime were recognized in a broad sense as

possibly giving cause to extreme action by Castro against

the President. Héwever, that specific operations might have

amore specific effect simply was not conceived at that

e. ‘In fact, the HSCA-Report states that the provocation
theory was first advanced in 1967 by members of the criminal
syndicate. While CIA might be faulted for not perceiving
the provocation theory in this form earlier, the fact is

that it did not. In any event, the concept is still a

theo.


13-00000

Statements to the effect that CIA “withheld" information
on specific operations directed against Castro have the
connotation of a deliberate suppression of the information
If one is to accept the HSCA conclusion that the concept was
Rot developed until 1967, then objective fairness would
require a modification of the characterization accorded the
abserice of reporting.

The 1977 Task Force Report accepted in principle the
hypothesis of the provocation theory. The report states, as
cited in the HSCA Report, that CIA should have taken broader
initiative than it did. Contrary to the HSCA Report, however,
the CIA Task Force Report did not fail to say what should be
done. what it did was to undertake what was not done in
1964. It reviewed all Cuban operations for any reference
to allegations of assassination plotting, or that might have a

specially provocative aspect. There are many pages of

{discussion of instances of reports found in the files on

assaSsination plotting, the persons who were involved, and
what relationship if any, CIA had with them. Each was followed
with an evaluation as to whether it could have provoked a
xetalitory attack on President Kennedy. This extensive

discussion was seen by several members of the HSCA staff,

but apparently not by the author of the section of the’ HSCA

Report where it is said that CIA did not say what should
have been done about it. This assertion in the HSCA Report

is in error.

At page 91 the HScA Report makes the following statement:

with Book v of its final report at the time Book V was in
draft. The 1977 Task Force Report specifically records that
viow. (See comments concerning page 97 of HSCA Report.)

The 1977 CIA Task Force Report, after presenting its critique
of the relevance of the ANLASH operation to the provocation theory,
nade the following statement concerning the significance of
its analysis:

“The result this has on the present comment

on the SSC Final Report may seen anomalous. It

places CIA in the position of contesting the
interpretation given the AMLASH operation in the

SSC Final Report, and to that extent the thesis that the
presentation was supposed to support. At the same

time, however, we are inclined to acknowledge in
principle the possibility--not seriously considered

as a likelihood during the Warren Commission inquiry-—
that ‘other operations could have suffered the
defects attributed to the AMLASH operation by the
SSC’Report. In protesting the presentation in one
instance, and the specific conclusions it seeks to
support, the effect is to disagree with a substantial
portion of the report as written. On the other
hand we tend to not contest a general thesis that
more specific attention could have been given by the
Warren Commission to the anti-Castro programs of the

.S. Governmant, including CIA activities.”
the thrust of the Task Force Report is at material variance

from the WSCA characterization of it. 46-13



Page 92 of the HSCA Report states that the 1977 Task
Torce Report made no inguixy into what was done in the
Florida Station. In fact, the 1977 Task Force Report specifically
described the frenetic and intensive activity there in
connection with the investigation following the assassination
of President Kennedy.

The statement that the 1977 Task Force Report failed to
document or even discuss the details of efforts, or the
responses cf ‘stations to CIA headquarters, is in error. There
is an entixe section in the Report devoted to intelligence
reporting disseminated to the intelligence community following
the death of President Kennedy and during the investigation
of the Warren Commission. In addition, there is a section of
several pages discussing the general nature of investigations
in the field, and reporting back from the field, with selectea
examples of that reporting. There is separate treatment of

information from Mexico City, where Oswald had visited. The

HSCA Report ignores (or the HSCA staff ignored) the detailed

resentation in the 1977 Task Force %eport

The 1977-CIA Task Force: Report on thé Mafia Plot

At page 97 of the HSCA Report the: statement appears that
GTA, with the Senate report, held that the plot with the Mafia
was irrelevant to the inquiry into President Kennedy's assassination.
This misrepresents the Task Force Report and CIA's actual
view of the matter!
As stated elu. cwhere, it was felt that the AMLASH operation
was irrelevant to the investigation, simply because the
relationship with AMLASH had not materialized into anything
involving commitments or agreements during President Kennedy's
Nfe. However; in the context of the provocation theory,
CIA felt that. the operation involving the criminal syndicate
came closer to filling the bill. 1t contained an actual plot,

urther, the 1977 CIA Task Force Report engaged in

the HSCA report, although the HSCA report would lead one to

believe there is no such treatment.

Gilberto Policarpo Lopez

At page 98 of the HSCA Report there is a discussion of
# man named. Gilberto Policarpo Lopez, an American citizen of
Cuban extraction. This man who flew,to Havandn on 27 Novenber
CIA reported on the man's flight, ana then ae the succeeding
Gays reported additional information concerning his travel
fhrough Mexico and his departure. This information was
Passed to the FBI. Under the arrangements at the time, the
PAT conducted extensive investigations of the man in the United
States. CIA had no investigative resources in Cuba, and
with the exception of interviewing a refugee from Cuba who
Knew something about Lopez it was unable to add to its earlier
reporting.

The confusion in this particular case arises out of a
report some months after the man's departure from Mexico.
Tt was filled with erroneous detail on facts already reported
accurately, and clearly was a report that could not be
accorded any validity. The report was not disseminated
because of. this, although a CIA cable addressed to the
Reporting source in the fiela, made the mistaken comment
“that the information jibea with that already available.
Quite frankly, that cable was in error. There was no reason
to do anything further. The decision against its dissemination

at that time remains valid today.



IX

Luisa Calderon

+ pages 1-2 DII-PATS, the HSCA report discusses
information concering a Cuban employee by the name of Zuisa
Calderon. This discussion is based on a memorandum written
in 1975 by a-cra employee for the Rockefeller Commission.
tt cites a field report of a conversation that Calderon’ had
taken place some five hours after the assassination of
President Kennedy which quotes her as “stating "I knew almost
before Kennedy." (emphasis added).

On the basis of this the HSCA perceives it as possible
fhat the statement constitutes an indication of foreknowledge
of the assassination of President Kennedy on the part of
Calderon,

The HSCA Report does not discuss the full information

sabout. the Calderon conversation.” ‘The “quotation “that she

"knew" was based on an incorrect translation whereby the

More positive "knew" should have appeared as "learned

Further, and to put the entire conversation into Perspective,

It also omits those elements of the reported conversation

that place the comment in context, xemoving the. inference placed

on the mistranslation. 35-16



The evolution of thissection of the HSCA Report is

interesting te the extant that it reveals attitudes on the
Part of the HSCA Staff. Calderon had suspected DGI (Cuban
intelligence service) connections. an early HSCA draft

Feport alleged that CIA withheld this’ information from the

Warren Commission, This was joined with a presentation that
tried to make Calderon out as a CIN agent. The heavy implication
of CIA deception was unconcealed. As the evidence proving

that these statements were untrue was brought forward, they

had to be dropped, not without reluctance. All that was

teft of the original dramatic presentation was a mistranslation

that omits qualifying facts.



x

Elena Garro

At page 3, DII-PATS there is. treatment of statements by
Elena Garro. Information concerning statements by this
person about Oswald's 1963 visit to Mexico City, came into
the possession of CIA in late 1964; after the Warren Commission

report had gone to press. It was duly reported to the FBI.

it is correct to say that there was a tendency to discount

the source, but CIA had no direct access to the person in

question. It is observed that Footnote 16 at the bottom of
obvious that CIA did collect some information

on the subject although the body of the text suggests that

it did not. Under the arrangements at the time, FBI headquarters

received additional information on the subject.



XI

Alleged Refusal of CIA to Make Available Sources In Mexico

At page 3, DII-PATS, Footnote 15, the HSCA Report states
that the “Committee's investigation in Mexico City was further
inhibited by the refusal of the CIA to make available its
sources on the Elena Garro allegation."

This statement is incorrect. CIA had no influence over
the persons in question (they were not established or controlleg
contacts) and the, Committee had to rely on Mexican authorities
who, also, labored under difficulties in locating or compelling
contacts by its citizens.or residents. ‘The Committee was made
aware of this, and this misstatement is despite information

to the contrary.



Contreras Allegations

At page 4, DII-PATS, at footnote 17, the HSCA Report states that Cian
“(t) Contreras story . . . was not adequately pursued when it first cem-————-——}

to the attention of CIA". Contreras alleged that he met Oswald during
his visit to Mexico in 1963. The Contreras allegation was first reported
fa half
CIA

by the American Consul in Tampico, Mexico, in May 1967, two a
years after the conclusion of the Karren Commission investigation.
representatives interviewed Contreras in dune 1967. It was felt inappro-
priate for CIA to be further involved directly, and the Agency recommended
that additional inquiry be conducted by Mexican authorities. CIA

disseminated the information from its interview, as it did with the

report by Mexican authorities.

Maurice (Morris) Bi sho)

At pages 11-13, DII-PATS, the HSCA Report discusses a man by the

chy
Mane of Antonio Veciana Blant and a man named Haurice Bishop with whom

he says he had contact. Veciana was involved with-a Cuban exile group

_ veyed ety
called ALPHA-66.. Veciana, told the HSCA he knew the man for over 13

2 Banas,

years and thE te met with the-aah on over 100 occasions. The HSCA
‘ried to establish the identity of this man Bishop, and wis organizational
affiliation. The HSCA was concerned that he might be from CIA and the
Report leaves the question somewhat up in the air.

C14 hes
Thene YF a very specific requirenent for review and approval of

continuing operational contact and recruitment of agents. A record
on this 1s required to be maintained in detail. Obviously impromptu and
one-time contacts may not be subject to such a controlled. procedure, but
even those usually are reported: There is no way that a CIA enployee
would have had operational contacts with a man such as Veciana, in the
way described by hin, without there being a rstior full record of it,
from approval of the relationship through detailed reports on it. Not ”
only would this be in operational’ files, but it would be in finendial
records. Any involvement with his organization would be similarly
recorded.

Above and beyond this there would have béen some record of a’man
with the name Maurice (Horris) Bishop, if he were from CIA. CIA never
hed an employee by that nane nor has any of its employees ever received
approval to use such a name as an alias or a pseudonym. Additionally,
Veciana’s organization, ALPHA-66, Was not oxenef—those-organizations-

supported by the CIA, 35-23



Maurice (Morris) Bisho (continued)

The former CIA euployee who recollected knowing of someone by the
name of Maurice Bishop is highly imprecise. He did not know the nan

Trafficante-Ruby

At page 25, DII-PATS, the HSCA Report erroneously attributes to 2
State Department cable information concerning a British journalist who
said that in 1959 an American gangster-type named Ruby visited an
American gangster in prison in Cuba. The name given the imprisoned
gangster was "Santos". This report was passed to the FBI and (subject
to Bureau verification) was included in its reporting to the Warren
Commission on roby-| There was subsequent reporting casting constderable
doubt on the stability and reliability of the journalist. Contrary to
the statenent in the HSCA Report, to the effect that CIA did nothing
further on the subject, following a search of Agency sources, a six page
report concerning the man was provided the FBI.

Today, it is speculated that the Santos mentioned in the report
fromLondor may be the sane as Santo Trafticantey fe she made the
possible connection ir 1964, and those who knew about Trafficante!s
involvenent in the Castro plot probably did not see the cabled report.

At’ page 41, DII-PATS, the HSCA Report: states that "Ruby may have met

with Trafficante". It goes on to suggest. that CIA knew that in 1964 and

one
discounted it; the fact .is that the,report ‘about such an encounter did

not: name Trafficante, but a man by the name ‘of Santos instead. The

treatment by the Committee on this point is misleading.

At page 59 of DII-PATS, the HSCA Report enphasizes the possibility
that CIA may have a significant record concerning Lee Harvey Oswald that
has not been found. While one must assume that this is a theoretical
Possibility, it is a most unlikely possibility. There obviously are
Seny casual contacts with persons of no interest, on whom there ame will
not be a record simply because there was no reason to make a record.
However, in instances in which “an individual was affiliated with the
Agency", as stated in the HSCA Report, there would be a record. There
ere records on Lee Harvey Oswald, but they show no contact with him.
Further, the Agency has conducted such an extensive search for aly
manner of records concerning him that it is safe to say that all significant
references tc hin have been found. The Committee's attempt to cover
the possibility of there being such a record is more than slightly

overstated.

Possibility of a Dual Filing System

At page 65, DII-PATS, the HSCA Report states that “the Con
was aware of the possibility that a dual filing system" could have been
used to disguise the relationship with Oswald. This so-called awareness
Stems from the fact that an instance came to the attention of HSCA
investigators in which two CIA employees contemplated establishing a
false file in order to conceal the true records of a sensitive operation,

The HSCA Report failed to acknowledge that what had been contemplated
by the two employees was,in Fact, not carried out. False or dual files

were not used. Any familiarity with the Agency fi1 ing system--whatever

Popular views to the contrary--would make it clear why the contemplated

CIA Reporting on Oswald Before the Assassination

The HSCA Report criticizes CIA reporting both before and after the
assassination of President Kennedy. Because the point is made in that
way, it is important te keep in mind that prior to the assassination

there was no particular reason to report in-depth on a man by the name

~
of Lee Oswald who was something of a nonentity.|

CIA learned that a man calling himself Lee Oswald (not Lee Harvey

facilities by unidentified persons. This information was in CIA

files, but. it was not until after the assassination that it was reviewed
and some: of it was identified, by analysis, ‘as involving Lee Harvey
Oswald. The point is that prior to the assassination Oswald's name had
been made known only in connection with his contact with the Soviet
embassy on 1 October. There had been no research of the files prior to

the assassination, and it.was only by analysis after the assassination

that the other contacts became known, The fact is that CIA did report

Reporting to the Warren Comission

‘At page 102, Dir- “PATS, of the HSCA Report, there is discussion
about reporting to the Warren Commission. tn this discussion, a statement
by Hr. Helms that CIA responded only to specific requests is Joined to
e'statenent that the working level focal point in the Agency for
dealing with the Conmission did not know about the anti-Castro plotting.

Two. points should be made on this. First, Mr. Helms‘ recollection
on this point is partly inaccurate. The record is replete with reporting
by CIA to the Warren Commission, on its own initiative and not solely ‘in
Response to specific requests. of course, it reported ‘extensively to”
the FBI which in turn reported to the Warren Corimi sion.

The footnote 8 cited on this page seems to accept the provocetion
theory as fact. By not reporting operational details, therefore, CIA is
Judged as failing to meet its responsibility. It is only noted here, as
is stated elsewhere in these Couments, that the provocation theory did

of the inquiries. With the advantage of hindsight, it would have been
desirable had the concept been developed then as it was later, according
to the HSCA Report, in 1967. And perhaps it would have been useful if
HSCA had inquired intonthose goher activities as well. CIA conducted
its review following articulation of the provocation theory in Book V of
the Church Conmittee final report. The findings of that review are in

conversation was meaningless by reasonable standards was offered, whether

or not it was acceptable to the Committee.

Characterization of ANLASH Operation

At paye 163, Volure X of the HSCA Report, the Committee eaphasizes
the recollections of a former CIA employee called Langosch, to the
effect that the AMLASH operation was characterized as an assassination
opera-ion during the period preceding the death of President Kennedy.

Langosch was not aware of or privy tothe details of the AMLASH
operation during the period preceding the assassination of President
Kennedy. While he had a staff responsibility, as a counterintelligence
officer, for security aspects of the relationship, he had not been made
Witting of the substantive details of what went on. As has been stated
elsewhere ANLASH/1 had been evaluated as an unstable man who did not
have the self-discipline to accept directions ar to serve in the role of
2 controtled agent. As a result, the records show that the decision wes
made to attempt to work through ‘some of his colleagues while retaining a
Contact with him. As a senior person in the Castro government, his
potential seemed great, whatever the difficulties of dealing with
him,

The problem was one of how to hold the contact open without getting

involved in activities that could not be controlled or influenced.

On 29 October 1963 Desmond Fitzgerald met with AMLASH/1 and told

him he would be given no support in preparation for a coup in Cuba. All
of the planning papers showed that AMLASH/1 was to be told only that if
he succeeded would he receive support, and that after the fact.° The
report of the meeting shows that the plan was adhered.to. Later reporting

wes Such that the decision was taken to make sowe gesture that had
Sufficient tangible appearances to keep the contact alive. This took
the form of a pen, designed to contain a syringe to administer poison,
which was offered to AMLASH/1 at about the very time of the President's
assassination in Dallas.

The point of this sequence of events is that during the President's
Mfe, CIA had no conmitment to AMLASH/1, and had made no representations
Of Support to him, Reporting showed that he knew this. The significance

Of this is that--in the context of the provocation theory--he had

nothing that he could report or leak concerning U.S. support.

When Langosch testified before the Church Committee, he stated that

he could not recall the time frame of the activity. Yet, the time frame
was key to the analysis of the operational relationship with AMLASH/1,
particularly in the context of the provocation theory.’ With. the HSCA,
however, Langosch recalled a time frame for events, as well as facts
that are inconsistent with all the evidence about the development of the
operation.

The HSCA Report cites an affadavit, by a former CIA employee known
as Pollock, one of the two people living today who know the details of
the AMLASH operation at the time in question, He contradicts the’ state-
ments made by Langosch as to: how the AMLASH operation was aracterized
during the period preceding President Kennedy's death

Characterization’ of AMLASH Operation (continued)

It is of some interest that the HSCA investigators did not elect to
call ag witnesses the two living persons who knew the details of

the AMLASH operation at the time that it was going on. One of them, 2

retired CIA employee, volunteered an aff{davit by way of refuting the

recollections of Langosch. The existence of the other one, whose

testimony is cited in the Church Committee report, was not secret. An{

HSCA review of the AMLASH es. was not extensive, reviewing only one of
the folders of the entire file (14 in number) which was made available
for them.

The handling of this phase of the investigation by the HSCA staff

serves to confuse rather than clarify the issues.



1967 IG Report

At page 188 of Volume X of the HSCA Report, there is emphatic
criticism of a statement in the 1967 1G Report on the plotting against
Fidel Castro. The offening Statement is quoted in full:

"The gambling sykdicate operation had baen taken

from him (Colonel Edudrds), and, in retrospect, he

probably: acted properly \i briefing the Attorney General

on only that aspect of thé operation for which he had

been responsible and of which he had direct, personal

knowledge." \

Edwards was the Director of Security, under whom the so-called Phase 1
Of the Castro plot with the criminal syndicate was carried out.

The briefing of. the Attorney General was on 7 Mey 1962. A memorandum
on the briefing, sent’ to the Attorney Generat\at his later request, was
dated 14 May On. that same dete, 14 May, Edvdlds wrote another mendrandun
for the Office of Security file, stating that Ha vey (the man taking
over what the 1967 1G Report termed Phase II of the operational relation
with the syndicate), had told him that-he was dropping the contact with
the members of ‘the syndicate.

\

In 1967, when fe was interviewed in connect fon with the IG inquiry,

\
Edwards could not recall that he knew that his assistant was in-Miami

turning over his contacts to Harvey’, at about ‘the samt time that Edvards
was briefing the. Attorney General. This specific point is recorded in
the IG Report, although the IG Report expresses the view that Edwards
must have known at the time (1962). It was net until 1875, ‘in the
