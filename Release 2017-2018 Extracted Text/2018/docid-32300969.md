JULIUS SALSBURY was investigated in case entitled "PASQUALE

As previously reported, USA,

Baltimore, declined prosecution because SALSBURY refused to

admit having been shaken down or to testify.

During the course of investigation of FRANK FIDELE

CORBI,

Baltimore file 92-175, Bureau file 92-3621, efforts

have been made to establish a headquarters from which CORBI

operates in order that a highly confidential source concerning

him can be developed.

Surveillances and information from

informants has indicated that CORBI travels a great deal around

the Baltimore Metropolitan area frequently conducting his bus-

iness in public restaurants and on the sidewalk.

PCI JOHN

GAMBINO has now succeeded in securing employment by CORBI

as night bartender at Kathleen's Musical Bar which is owned

and operated by CORBI at 612 E. Baltimore Street.

GAMBINO

has already been able

to furnish information concerning

visitors to CORBI in an apartment above CORBI's, restaurant

next door at 616 E. Baltimore Street.

This apartment is

occupied by a relative of CORBI's, MARY PURCELL.
