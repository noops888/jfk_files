Attached are two copics of a memerandum for the record on the Subject of o
contact votyee? Robert F. CHATHAM and "Professor LAURA" to whem reference was
nado in bothGHANIDIE39 and DIR-39952. Thio contact ues made at tho requast
of the deputy chief to HIDWATCH. A sanitised copy of the mencrandum has
bean transaitted to the MIIMATCH officoe Any action in furthorarce of the
@iacusoions described in the memorandum would necossarily be taken by the
lecal OLACID eatablishment.

Ho plans are pressntly known for extending ONACID support to Subject; how=
ever, if any euch support were to be given by private persons (such es
Secrotary ARANETA) thie probably would not becca known to ODYOXE circles.

It appeared from hio remarks that Subject had not *contacted KUBARK channels
dn tho coureo of his current Asian tour -- either in India or Indochina.
Dicerwet questioning revealed that the 2 March maoting under ARANSTA's
eponsorehip was evidently Subjoct's firat direct appeal, in tho course of
his current tour, to ODYOKE far asaistanco. Howover, Subject, may havo been
withholding datails of othor contacts with ODYOKE represontativess This
uoald appear o volid avsunption in viow af the fact that he donied (in
response to a question) that he had contacted GDTOME representatives recent=
ly in Hong Kong (per parngraph five of GHAND-9539)

2

With reference to tho potential for KUBARK purposes of Subject's organisation,
4t became manifestly apparent in the course of his remarka that no cohesive
vehicle exists for the purposes he described (however laudatory his purposes,
porticularly in tho Hanoi-Haiphong arcas); that Subject hao given only
Limited attention to the types of materials to be disseminated by his
"friends"; and that Subject appeared to bo far too unayotcaatiec to be
entrusted vith anything but the finished product in quantity (rather than
funds to arrange for its publication). i

On tho evening of 2 March 1955, CHATHAM proceeded to the apartment of Agriculture
Sooretary SalvadérfaRNETA with a neabor of tho OLACID political section and an
ODCHOP staff membar. In brief convorsation with the ODCHOP officer prior to
reaching the ARANETA hene, CHATHAN caploined that he had beon instrected not to
opsoifigally identify hinself as anything but OLACID (that is, not to claim

UBIA eonnections'; and that sozething was known of tho “Professor's”

autivitdes eloovhere, which though apparently well intentioned, were subject to
Gone question from the OLYOKE policy viewpoint. The ODCHOP officer explained
that his only interest was in complying with tho wishes of ARANETA (with whom

he had close liaison relationship vbich he di not wish to jeopardise in any way)
that he bring scus representative of OlACLi by to meet hie guest.
