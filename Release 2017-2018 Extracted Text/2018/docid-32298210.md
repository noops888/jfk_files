ADMINISTRATIVE

The Intelligence Unit of the Miami Police
Department comes under ‘the supervision of Captain LEE
NAPIER. The Intelligence Section has been investigating
matters relating to Cuban revolutionary activities during
the past two and one-half years, and has made several
seizures of guns and a number of arrests relating to
violations of local ordinances. It is possible that
some of NAPIER's contacts with Cuban revolutionists
have been of a legitimate nature pursuant to his official
duties.

U. S. Customs, Miami, has advised that NAPIER
has, in different ways, tried to get information from
U. S. Customs, both in Washington, D. C., and Miami,
Florida, concerning anti-TRUJILLO groups. They. have
refused to give him any information, suspecting that he
would transmit this information to the Dominican Republic.

AL TARABOCHIA, Deputy Sheriff, Intelligence Unit,
Dade County Department of Public Safety (formerly the
Sheriff's Department), advised that the Intelligence Unit
does not trust or cooperate with NAPIER.

Miami Office contacts NAPIER only on certain
matters within his jurisdiction, and then with great
circumspection, and considers most information furnished
by NAPIER as being self-serving and not within the realm

of verification.

It is noted that RODRIGUEZ COUEIRhas, on several
occasions, desired MM 639-S to be introduced to NAPIER.*
The Special Agent handling MM 639-S has instructed informant,

ae MM T-4 said ‘he subsequently talked to’ RODRIGUEZ
who said that. NAPIER was very friendly and told him that
4f he ever got into trouble, to call him and he would do
everything he could to help him.(¥) Ww)

RODRIGUEZ said that at times, NAPIER has called
at his (RODRIGUEZ') residence and asked his advice prior to
performing some official act. RODRIGUEZ gave as an example
the time when ESTEBAN VENTURA first entered the United
States “in 1959, NAPIER came to RODRIGUEZ. and said VENTURA
was in the United States illegally and that he could arrest
VENTURA and have him deported. He asked if this was what
RODRIGUEZ wanted, and RODRJGUEZ said "No". NAPIER did not
have VENTURA arrested. (%), )

RODRIGUEZ alse said that NAPIER offered to give
RODRIGUEZ as much protection as he was able,to give regard-
ing RODRIGUEZ' revolutionary activity. @) )

On December 19, 1959, MM T-4 advised that at
about 2:00 a.m. that day, RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO was contacted
py an individual who Stated‘hée had a:method of shipping
guns to Cuba and that. RODRIGUEZ. should ; ediately obtain
what guns he could for this shipment .(. (pry

ROPRIGUEZ COUCEIRO immediately made a. telephone
call to Captain NAPIER and stated that he needed some more
"candy". Because of. the early hour, it appeared that NAPIER
was uncertain as to who was calling him, whereupon RODRIGUEZ
stated he wanted more "candy", the same type that NAPIER
had. previously delivered to RODRIGUEZ at a motel. RODRIGUEZ
told NAPIER he needed the "candy" before 6:00 ann. ACY)

At about 3:30 a.m. on December 19, 1959, NAPIER
arrived at the residence of RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO in a
Chevrolet automobile, was met by RODRIGUEZ outside the
house, whereupon NAPIER opened the trunk of the automobile
and gave a box containing 19 revolvers to RODRIGUEZ. NAPIER

immediately left. No money exchange between NAPIER and Ch Ny
