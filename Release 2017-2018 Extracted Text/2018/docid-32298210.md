ADMINISTRATIVE

The Intelligence Unit of the Miami Police

Department comes under the supervision of Captain LEE

NAPIER.

The Intelligence Section has been investigating

matters relating to Cuban revolutionary activities during

the past two and

one-half years, and has made several

seizures of guns and a number of arrests relating to

violations of local ordinances. It is possible that

some of NAPIER's contacts with Cuban revolutionists

have been of a legitimate nature pursuant to his official

duties.

U. S. Customs, Miami, has advised that NAPIER

has, in different ways, tried to get information from

U. S. Customs, both in

Washington, D. C., and Miami,

Florida, concerning anti-TRUJILLO groups. They have

refused to give him any information, suspecting that he

would transmit this information to the Dominican Republic.

AL TARABOCHIA, Deputy Sheriff, Intelligence Unit,

Dade County Department of Public Safety (formerly the

Sheriff's Department), advised that the Intelligence Unit

does

not trust or cooperate with NAPIER.

Miami Office contacts NAPIER only on certain

matters within his jurisdiction, and then with great

circumspection, and considers most information furnished

by NAPIER as being self-serving and not within the realm

of verification.

It is noted that RODRIGUEZ COUŒIDhas, on several

occasions, desired MM 639-S to be introduced to NAPIER.•

and that at no time had he ever given NAPIER $700100

as a salary or for any other purpose.

ME. HERNANDEZ stated that at no time had he

ever employed any police officer of the Miami Police

Department of of any other police agency in the United

States.

Mr• HERNANDEZ stated any statement to the

contrary was

absolutely false and without any founda-

receive considerable information from time to time

relating to 1llegal

smuggling and other revolutionary-

type activities on the part of Cuban exiles then

residing in the Miami area, and that he did furnish

NIC. HORNANDEZ stated during the time he was

consul General, on onLy two occasions had the Cuban

consulate received any assistance from the Miami Police

Department, and that on neither of these occasions

was assistance requested.

He explained on one of these

occasions, which arose in 1957 when a group of Cuban

exiled demonstrators began to march from Bayfront Park,

want, to the Cuban Consulate, carrying banners and

placards,

the Miami Police Department atteupted to

stop

this unlicensed narch. Two officers were severely

beaten. The march was broken up, and a considerable

number of demonstrators were arrested by the Miami

Police Department.

An Incident was thus avoided at the

Cuban Consulate.

The second incident occurred when Mr. HERNANDEZ

was at the Seaboard Railroad Station in Miami with the

family of a Cuban offielal who was departing for Washington,

D. C.

A large group of threatening Cuban demonstrators

appeared on the scene, some reportedly with guns, and

the Miami Police Department rushed police to the scene to

avola an incident.

A considerable number of these

demonstrators were also arrested by the Miami Police

Department.

IM T-I, on March 111959 advised that Rou

on a man gun dealer, contacted GILBERTO, FERNANDEZ,

who had reportedly served as a major in the July 26th

Revolutionary Movement. FERNANDEZ disclosed that he

then remarked "They are very nice they will take care.

The only thing you have to see what you can do.

If you

can do anything with us, we'll work with you 100%.

You

can count on that." MM C-1 was unable to furnish more

MM T-4 said he subsequently talked to RODRIGUEZ

who said that NAPIER was very friendly and told him that

1f he ever got into trouble, to

caly him and he would de

everything he could to help him.(x)(M)

RODRIGUEZ said that at times, NAPIER has called

at his (RODRIGUEZ') residence and asked his advice prior to

performing some official act.

RODRIGUEZ gave as an example

the time when ESTEBAN VENTURA first entered the United

States in 1959, NAPIER came to RODRIGUEZ and

was in the United States lllegally and that he could arrest

VENTURA and have him deported.

He asked if this was what

RODRIGUEZ wanted,

and roDRIGUEZ said "No". NAPIER did not

have VENTURA arrested: (4)M)

RODRIGUEZ also said that NAPIER offered to give

RODRIGUEZ as much protection as he was able to give regard

ing RODRIGUEZ' revolutionary activity. (&M

On December 19, 1959, MM T-4 advised that at

about 2:00 a.m. that day, RODRIQUEZ COUCEIRO was contacted

by an individual who stated he had a method of shipping

guns to cuba and that rodriGuez should immediately obtain

what guns he could for this snipent ((m)

RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO immediately made a telephone

call to Captain NAPIER and stated that he needed some more

"candy". Because of the early hour, it appeared that NAPIER

was uncertain as to who was calling him, whereupon RODRIGUEZ

stated he wanted more "candy", the same

type that NAPIER

had previously delivered to RODRIGUEZ at a motel.

RODRIGUEZ

told NAPIER he needed the "candy" before 6:00 a.m. I.(S)(M)

At about 3:30 a.m. on December 19, 1959, NAPIER

arrived at the residence of RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO in a

Chevrolet automobile, was met by rodrIGuez outside the

house, whereupon NAPIER opened

the trunk of the automobile
