am not too far off in what I am about to tell you. The contract

was structured in such, a way that as the bottoms of other

companies became obsolete, they could only be replaced with

Onassis' tankers.

Even ARAMCO had to, by attrition, within a

period of four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years, would have,

if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced

by Onassis tankers.

Our statistics, after having studied the contract and

making what we considered to be proper projections, indicated

that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half years,

Mr. Onassis would control more dead weight tonnage than the

United States controlled in its entirety, that he would control

on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of

gallons more than were used by all of the Allied nations during

the most severe year of the

Korean War, that in the first year

his profit would be approximately $17 million dollars, that

after five-and-a-half years his annual profit would be in the

area of $200 million.

While this analysis is going on, we also found that a

million dollar pay-off had been made to one of the top ministers

in Saudi Arabia and we had the evidence

expenses. I think his total expenses were slightly in excess

of $8,000. He didn't even keep the banking and percentage

for himself, or a piece of the action, so to speak, and he was

highly, highly loved by the Saudis and although the old king

was then gone and king Saud, the son. was in power, Mry

that -- he already had a clearance, a satisfactory clearance,

and I convinced him to precede me to Saudi Arabia to try to

lay the groundwork.

Senator Schweiker.

What year was this, roughly?

Mr. Maheu. This, I believe, was in '54 or '55, yes.

Anyway, I finally ended up going to Saudi Arabia, having

a meeting with the King's confidential assistant, presenting all

of this evidence, frankly at the time not knowing if the King

himself had a piece of the action --

Senator Huddleston. Had some of this evidence come from

the wiretap?

Mr. Maheu. That tap was entirely unproductive, entirely

unproductive.

Senator Schweiker. What happened then at your meeting?

Mr. Maheu. Well, it's very interesting, if we could take

a little time, I mean, I was scheduled to have the meeting

"with the king," but he doesn't show, he stays somewhere else

and the confidential assistant shows up and one trusted

minister that he had withl

present.

And my meeting was scheduled for 8:00 p.m. one night, and

this happaned to be the last day that the king was supposed to

be in Jidda, he was then leaving for the capital further

inland, Jidda being the only major port in Saudi where he

spends his summers, and they were having a big parade for him,

and from the balcony of the hotel, I'm watching the parade go

by, and finally the King's car comes and he is arm and arm with

ther nan on whom I'm going to give the evidence that night, and

I frankly was not too comfortable, particularly in view of the

fact that in those days -- and I don't know whether it has

changed, but in Saudi, the same document did not give you

permission to enter and leave; you had to make application for

an exit visa after you arrived, and I was in constant contact

with the then-United States Ambassador. He made it very clear

that the government approved of everything I was doing, but if

something went wrong they could not come to my rescue, I would

have to be the fall guy, and I was prepared to do it. That was

Saudi Arabian government would have its flag flying the high

seas, and at the time that all of this is going on they are

building what then, upon completion of production, had been

the biggest tanker in the world at that time, a ship named

after the old King, a tanker which was scheduled to go and take

a maiden flight and take off, and it turned out the biggest

problem that we had was to find a save-face gimmick. But

finally the whole thing was accomplished, and it took two and

a half years to do it.

Senator Schweiker. I didn't mean to get you off the

track.

Mr. Maheu. Well, I'm sorry I am so verbose.

Senator Huddleston. You said you bought a paper in

Athens?

You mean by that you actually bought the paper or just

paid them to run the story?

Mr. Maheu. We bought a newspaper.

You'll have to understand, Senator, that in Rome, in those

days, there were fifty newspapers. I mean, the big circulation

in those days, big circulation in Rome was 20,000. It's hard

for us to visualize that.

Senator Huddleston.

Mr. Maheu.

Yes.

Can we go off the record?

Senator Schweiker. Yes:

Onassis wiretap. You may have already have answered that.

Mr. Maheu. I think I did, yes.

Mr. Madigan. What did you say?

MI. Maheu. My recollection is that I appeared before a

Grand Jury that was investigating Mr. Frank on another

matter.

Mr. Madigan. On another matter, but you had no recollection

of any investigation of that particular tap? ...

Mr. Maheu. No, I don't.

provided for this leader during his visit to the United States.

Mr. Maheu. My racollection is that my rola was limited

simply to fund their income. In other words, they would be on

the payroll of Robert A. Maheu Associates and that I would be

reimbursed the exact amount of their pavroll.

payroll, and for the second time I was turned down by Mr.

Hughes. I believe it was in September of 1969 that I finally

called Mr. Meier in and requested his resignation and then

I informed Mr. Hughes that he had resigned.

After the departure of Mr. Meier, while going through his

files, Mr. Ellson ran into some documents that indicated some

very serious double escrows on mining proparties and we

recommended to Mr. Hughes that all the information be made

available to the authorities and let the chips fall where they

may.

Mr. Liebengood. Do you know why Mr. Hughes was not inclined

to follow your recommendations with regards to Meier's termina-

tion at earlier dates?

Mr. Maheu. He was afraid that Meier would embarrass him.

At least, that is what he told me.

Mr. Liebengood. You are aware of no CIA interest in

Meier?

Mr. Maheu.

The only thing I know is that Meier was cut

in on the cover

and was aware of

that operation.

Mr. Liebengood. How did that come about? How was he

cut in on that?

Mr. Maheu. Because it was he who initially had worked on

a deal for a venture in Mexico on the part of Hughes Aircraft

name slips my mind, but I believe his last name was Jamie,

to discourage him from filing such a lawsuit I suggested that
