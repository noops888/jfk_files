SUBJECT : Flights from Mexico City to Havana on 22 llovenber 1963

REFERENCE: 1. What is the total CIA information on the two flights
from Mexico City to Havana?

2. What was done at the time to develop further information
on this matter?

3. Can further information be acquired on this matter now?
FINDINGS:

1. The Mexico Station records confirm only one flight from Mexico City
to Havana on 22 November 1963. This was the regularly scheduled Cubana
Airlines flight. There were two reports of small aircraft flights (one
a twin engine flight to Mexico City connecting with Cubana for onward
transportation to Havana of a mysterious passenger; and the other a flight
allegedly from Dallas, Tijuana, and Mexico City to Havana with two "gang-
land" type passengers.) Beyond the original reports (from sources of
undetermined reliability) there was nothing in the Mexico Station records
to substantiate that these flights occurred.

2. Facts substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 22 November
1963 a Cubana Airlines plane from Havana arrived at the Mexico City Inter-
national airport at 1620 hours - Mexico City time and departed on a return
flight to Havana at 2035 hours - Mexico City time. It was on the ground in
Yexico City for about four hours which would be considered normal for servicing
for a turn-around flight carrying passengers in both directions. This infor-
mation was obtained from sensitive telephone taps in the process of routine
operating procedures on 22 November 1963.

3. Report not substantiated by Mexico Station records: On 30 November
1963 CIA Headquarters cabled "Mexico City that a report had been received
that the 22 Novenber 1963 Cubana departure had been delayed five hours from
1700 to 2200 hours awaiting an important passenger who arrived at the Hexico
City airport in a private twin motor aircraft at 2130 hours Mexico time.
Passenger transferred directly to Cubana plane without going through customs
or immigration and travelled in pilot's cabin to Havana. 2/ This information
was passed to the Mexican officials on 2 December 1963 for ‘investigation.
There is no record of a reply. We know from independent information in
paragraph two above that some parts of this report are in error. The Cubana
flight was not delayed for five hours. It had departed for Havana from
Mexico City at 2035 hours which would be at Teast an hour before the twin
motor aircraft was alleged to nave arrived in Mexico City. The source's
name is on the manifest as a passenger from Hexico City to Havana but the
time supplied by him does not agree with other information considered reliable.

the Mexican Goverment assured the §.S Anlussador that it ws taking
steps to centro] travellers and closed t porder with the U.S. for
several hours immediately after the assassination, 3/ A flight of a
private aircratt such as this is possible but it is tnlikely that such
tmusual activity as this would have gone unnoticed by the Mexico Station

tean of observers who reported on Qubama Airlines flights. 4/

4. Report not substantiated by Mexico Station records:
1964 the Hamburg Base reported that a source in Cuba claimed to
an aircraft with Mexican markings discharge passengers at the Ievana airport
at 1700 hours on 22 November 1963. The source reported that the two passen-
gers “were gangsters” and that "the plane had just come from Dallas, via
Tijuana (here it was forced to land because of engine trouble) and Mexico
City." 5/. This information was sent to the FBI on 23 December 1964 for
investigation. 6/ The FBI responded on 31 December 1964 that Tijuana
would have been an unlikeiy place for a “forced landing" on a flight froa
Pallas to Havana. Their office was making no further inquiries in the
absence of additional details fron CIA. They suggested that CIA conduct.
an investigation in Tijuana. 7/ (Tijuana is almost the sazc distance frez
Mullas Flying West as ilavana would be Flying Southeast or Mexico City sould
be flying South.) The Mexico Station had no investigativ e assets in the
Tijuana area. The information was a ycar old when received and mich too
vague for- retroactive checking of records, The untested source who had H
provided the. report died before he could be questioned for additional ae :

etails.

S. The SSC V report page 103 further complicates travel data by the
Listing of the Cubana Mirlines flight delay from "6 p.m. until 11 p.m.”
The writers of this report sere probably trying to transpose the doparture
time to the equivalent of Eastern time. Their information is dated 1
Pecember 1963 ihich is probably a mistaken reference to the cable which
js dated 30 Noverber 1963. 2/ The Mexico Staticn file copy of this cable ‘

carried the date cf 1 DecenDer 1963 which is the date it was received. a :
