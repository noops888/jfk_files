Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1 aneeeatcowse: REPRODUCTION PROHIBITED

From the time the Mexico Station was opened| in April 1947} until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station{in 1955) the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a
mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by{an employee of the local

[telephone company who was} handled by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

- American recruited agents. i

‘Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

: assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of —
the block south. It had a Planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early {1959,| due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral] mail intercept operation,
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American case officer. (A recruited]

{Mexican agent, who had a semiofficial status) obtained selected letters

from a subagent \employed by the Mexican postal system,

2. (Liaison Coverage:

{Liaison\ coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the| Mexican services} at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS) ,\with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were enteral, and corrupt.{ A Station

\_officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In nt

(1958, at_the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap |

Operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as |

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by! Mexican

[Army officers.) In 1961, {because of mismanagement by the Mexican print

{eipais, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

%. Sota covers: REPRODUCTION PROHIBITED

In mid-1962, {the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the)
joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the \LIENVOY (isténing)

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in Qnticipation of possible coverage} The Station immediately

(that they would not be discovered when the Mexicans hooked up theiy,

eae (taps, (The Mexicans\soon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

‘ C00U161



ra language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-
self as -Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy,- Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening all Photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount ‘of unused film remaining.

. Tihe ‘instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
{totogranh all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with
{foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the, agents

were’ conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the
Photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made ‘in
either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.

‘Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Enbassy Chancery
‘the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if-the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4:or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa_here (in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet ag i
(the American), “+ showed him a \

DURAN: ee SO, Ko the problem with him (the American)

he doesn't know anyone in Cuba and in that case it
# very difficult to give him a visa, because he was
thinking of processing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take a long time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.
SOVIET: ..that the thing | is that if his (the Anerican) wife were
“now in Washington (and) gig to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is’ going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can commmicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.
DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because tl do not know if the visa will be approved.
SOVIET: They can Ce eet the visa according to instructions.
DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.
SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
T don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.
DURAN: It.was no bother, thank you very much.

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

‘At 1235 hours 4 man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is’in the Russian Embassy and they need to
know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in'@essa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger. may)fest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and.SAN°ROMAN’are shipping representatives

a call was made to the fivSt, listing for the Soviet Embassy in the D
Mexican telephone direttory ‘which turned out to be the Military Attache).

+ Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that’lie doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her,name and
someone will-return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet ‘thanks her. OC 0173
