CUBANS APPREHENSIVE OVER POSSIBLE US POLICY CHANGE

Cuban leaders are appre-
hensive that President Kennedy's
assassination will result in a
more "aggressive" US policy. to-
ward Cuba.

Fidel Castro's two-hour
speech on 23 November, which he
termed an “objective analysis"
of the implications of the
assassination, warned Cubans
that the President's death was
"serious and bad news." It
could, he said, turn."a bad
situation" into a worse one.

He also asserted that President
Kennedy's alleged promise not
to invade Cuba had been strongly
attacked by those "ultrareac-
tionaries" in the United States
who now are trying to create a
climate of "anti-Soviet and
anti-Cuban hysteria" designed
to pressure the new US Presi-
dent toward a Cuban policy
"highly prejudicial to the in-
terests of peace and of man-
kind."

Castro stated that he had
never heard of Lee Harvey Oswald
and insinuated that the Castro-
Communist: affiliations of the
accused assassin were fabricated
by. US “reactionaries” who, he
claimed, were the only people

who could benefit from the Presi
dent's death. In this connec-
tion he warned that a "sinister
maneuver" was under way, and
declared "we must be cautious
and vigilant and alert."

Che Guevara echoed these
warnings in a speech of 24
November, declaring that "the
years coming are going to be
as tough as, if not tougher
than, the years just past...we
must be prepared to repel any
attack." He expressed confi-
dence in ultimate victory, not
only for Cuba but also for
“the peoples of Latin America."

Guevara stressed that the
revolutionary ferment in Latin
America is reaching a climax
and that the people there "are
going to conquer power in what-
ever manner necessary, destroy-
ing whatever force that opposes
them." He pointed out that
Cuba's continuing "anti-imperi-
alist struggle" is closely
linked with the coming revolu-
tion in the rest of Latin Amer-
ica. "The'fight of all peoples
is also our responsibility,"
he maintained, "and it is part
of our daily preoccupation."

Moscow apparently has de=
cided to refrain from harass-
ing Allied convoys on the Berlin
autobahn, at least for the time
being. On 21 November the USSR
replied to the Western notes of
6 November which protested the

‘detention of the US convoy on

4-5 November, The main purpose
of the reply was to restate for
the public record the Soviet
claim that the June 1945 agree-
ment between the Soviet and
Western commanders in Germany
gave the USSR the right to ex-
ercise "protection, maintenance
supervision, and control" on
highways used by the Western
garrisons in Berlin,

The Soviet note sought to
strengthen this claim by stating
that the "harmonized procedures"
conveyed by the Western powers
on 29 October "are in no degree
valid for Soviet military au-
thorities." Moscow denied
that American authorities have
any right to establish the ob-
ligations and "manner of opera
tion" of Soviet checkpoint of-
ficials,

The note reflected Moscow's
sensitivity to the point made
in the Western notes contrast-
ing the detention of the US
convoy with the normal process—
ing accorded closely similar
British and French convoys on
5 November which also refused
to dismount, Moscow took ref-
uge in the pretense that
these latter convoys were not
challenged because they observed
existing procedures and
"presented tueir personnel for

checking," whereas the US con-
voy was detained until it agreed
to "go through the same check."

The passage since the 4-5
November incident of five con-
voys of a size which are non-
dismountable under Allied pro-
cedures, the 16 November Soviet
statement on access procedures,
and Moscow's 21 November note
all suggest that Moscow has
decided to accept a standoff
in the autobahn dispute for the
present, The Soviet procedures
marked a clear retreat from
earlier extreme demands that. all
personnel in convoys of more
than five vehicles are obliged
to dismount, Although the Soviet
procedures are not identical to
the Western "harmonized proce-
dures," the differences are not
great enough in themselves to
give rise to gurther incidents.
The Soviet rules seem to pro-
vide Moscow with a practical
working arrangement not incon-

‘sistent with normal Western

convoy practices.

In light of the failure
to divide the Allies on the
access issue and the reper-
cussions of the Barghoorn case,
the Soviet leaders probably de-
cided this was not an opportune
time to propose formal negoti-
ations, Their efforts to es-
tablish an exclusive right to
control autobahn traffic, how-
ever, suggest that the Russians
will revive this issue whenever
theyfeel the situation is ripe
for another attempt to bring
the West into a new round of
Berlin negotiations, (SECRET

Pelee S ECONOMIC RELATIONS, WITH NON -COMMUNI ST ASTA

‘Com nist China’ s 's economic
activities in the countries of
non-Communist Asia now are re-
covering from the setback they
suffered in 1960 following the
failure of the "leap forward."

Peiping's 1963 trade with
most of these countries appears
to be above last year's, so the
Chinese probably will earn more
from their Asian trade this
year than they have in the re-
cent past. These earnings will
again be used chiefly to finance
imports of Western grain--which
presumably will continue at
about last year's level.

China's net export earnings
from trade with Hong Kong, its
largest source of free world
currency, are up about 25 per-
cent over 1962 and are running
at an annual rate of about $250
million. China's favorable
trade balance with Malaysia may
reach about $80 million this
year, about 10 percent over the
level achieved last year with
the members of the new federa-
tion. Sino-Japanese trade is
currently at an annual rate of
slightly over $100 million--up
from $84 million last year.

China's economic aid proj-
ects in the non-Communist Far
; East have been implemented
slowly in the last few years.
Such activities are expected to
remain at a moderate level as
long as China's attention is
riveted on earning foreign ex-
change to buy grain.

The Communist World

The Chinese may, however,
be willing to provide additional
economic assistance to Cambodia,
which so far has utilized about
60 percent of a total of $50
million in Chinese grants.
Peiping responded favorably al-
though cautiously to overtures
from Prince Sihanouk after his
announcement of Cambodia's de-
cision to end the US aid program.
Earlier good-will gestures in-
cluded Liu Shao-chi's visit to
Cambodia last May, followed by
a trip to China by a Cambodian
bank delegation. Recently
Chinese technicians arrived in
Cambodia to survey prospects for
construction of a glass factory
to be financed under a 1960 grant.

A Chinese delegation this
month arrived in Djakarta to
discuss implementation of a $30-
million credit extended in 1961
for a textile plant. Peiping
recently agreed to provide Cey-
lon with textile plants and
equipment under their $16-mil-
lion aid pact signed in 1957.

Peiping's largest single
economic aid pact--an $84-mil-
lion credit extended to Burma
in 1961--has been drawn down
by only about $2 million.

Burma, however, has recently
accepted a Chinese offer to
build two bridges in northern
Burma, and there are indications
that formal approval of other
Chinese aid projects will be
forthcoming in the near future.

JAPANESE ELECTION OUTCOME

The Japanese general elec-
tion on 21 November was charac~
terized by a paucity of real
issues and a low voter turnout.
It brought no significant shift
in the balance between the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
and the leftist opposition.

The LDP won 283 seats and
is expected to pick up most of
the 12 conservative “independ-
ents." Adherence by all of these
nevertheless would leave the LDP
still seven seats short of the
position it held after the 1960
elections.

*

On the left, the important
feature was the failure of the
Japan Socialist Party (JSP) to
gain, while the more moderate
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP)
obtained six more seats than it
won in 1960. The Japan Conmmnu-
nist Party (JCP) now holds five
seats, a gain of two over its
1960 performance.

The voter's support of the
LDP suggests that the electorate
is generally satisfied with con-
ditions and progress under the
Ikeda government. The LDP's
victory falls short, however,

out,

Asia~Africa

of assuring Ikeda a third term

as party president or of strength-
ening his position within the
party. Intensification of
internal rivalries for position
within the party is certain
until precedences among the fac-
tion leaders can be hammered
Actual damage to the Ay
party. and to Ikeda's position
nevertheless will probably be
offset by the fact that the lost fi
seats for the most part went
to the DSP, while the JSP, the
real enemy, was defeated.

A period of critical self- a
examination and possible changes
of leadership clearly are in
store for the JSP. Its net
loss of one seat in the face
of gains by its DSP and JCP
rivals may have seriously
damaged its carefully self-con-
trived image as the leftist
“wave of the future," destined
to control the government by ‘
1970. Loss of extreme left-
wing support to the JCP may be i
attributed to the confrontation
of the JSP and JCP over the nu-
clear test ban treaty and to
the JCP's pro-Chinese stand.

The JSP's failure to reform
internally may have influenced |
some voters to shift to the DSP.

CONGOLESE EXPEL SOVIET DIPLOMATS

Congolese Premier Adoula
last week declared all Soviet Em-
bassy personnel in Leopoldville
persona non grata. Adoula's move
followed the arrest on 19 Novem-
ber of two Soviet diplomats found
carrying documents showing the So
viets to be giving financial as-
sistance and encouragement to a
group of radical anti-Adoula
exiles across the Congo River in
Brazzaville, All of the Soviet
staff reportedly had departed by
23 November.

The premier charged that the
captured documents proved "unques~"
tionably" the collusion of the So-
viet Embassy with the leftist "com-
mittee of national liberation" in
Brazzaville, He did not however,
break diplomatic relations with
the Soviet Union and has stated
that he will consider the appoint-
ment of a new ambassador, Although

' \Moscow has bitterly protested the

‘expulsion of its officials, it has
indicated an intention to replace
them rather than retaliate against
the Congo.

No action has been taken

| against the Leopoldville missions

. tries--Czechoslovakia, Poland, and

They reportedly plan also to try to

ment, Their successes and capabili- |
ties presently seem limited, but
their activities may well lead to
further friction between the Leo-
poldville and Brazzaville regimes,

Katanga's ex-President Tshombé,
still in exile in Barcelona, has
again appealed to Adoula to permit
him to return soon to the Congo. The
Leopoldville government apparently
still opposes Tshombé's return, and
his bid for a high government post
has been rejected.

Tshombé's recent promise to col- '

laborate with the Leopoldville gov-
ernment in the 1964 parliamentary
elections appears to be having some
appeal, however. Tshombé says he
has decided to return soon, but has
indicated he will await assurances
for his personal safety from the
central government. (SECRET NO

MALAISE IN MALI

Mali's leftist government
is facing increasingly urgent
economic and political problems
|| at a time when President Modibo
:| Keita's efforts to mediate the
Moroccan-Algerian dispute have
raised his standing to a new high
elsewhere in Africa. In the
face of mounting criticism from
politicians with strong local
power bases and from young gov-
ernment functionaries, Keita

‘} is devoting major attention to

| defending his party's hegemony.

He must also contend with dissi-

dence among nomadic tribesmen

and witha desperate foreign ex-

change shortage.

The key problem probably
is that of foreign exchange.
The government brought most of
its troubles on itself a year
and a half ago when, in a fit
of excessive Marxist-flavored
anticolonialism, it in effect
cut itself off from automatic
access to the French foreign
exchange reserves and set up a.
Malian currency. Since then a
steady adverse trade balance
has cut into the country's own
meager reserves, and by mid-
November they had fallen to an
estimated $1 million. The gov-
ernment's budget deficit is
running about $14 million an-
ually. France reluctantly
bailed the Malians out once be-
fore with a stopgap dole, but
it may. be unwilling to do so
again. The bloc has consistent-
+ ly refused to extend budgetary

' assistance, although it has pro-

Asia-Africa

Doctrinaire rigidity has
helped to make ineffective the
government's efforts to alleviate
this situation. Whereas Guinea's
Sekou Touré has recently retreated
from "African socialism" when
faced with an even worse situa-
tion, Keita and his associates
have been reluctant to curtail
the activities of such ,consistent
money~losers as the state trading
company and the state airline.

This evidence of ineffective-
ness has brought to thé surface
dissatisfaction among local pol-
iticians whom Keita has never
succeeded in bringing under
close control of his Soudanese
Union Party. These local figures,
who generally occupy the conserv-
ative end of the spectrum, seem
to control the National assembly.
They also have at least some in~
fluential spokesmen both in the
party's political bureau and in
the executive branch of the gov-
ernment, especially among elements
desiring a pragmatic approach to
Mali's problems.

At the same time, Keita
is faced with active defiance
of the regime's authority on the
part of Tuareg nomads in the
country's northern deserts.
Half of the army reportedly
now is deployed in an effort,
so far unsuccessful, to halt
raids by these tribesmen. Keita
himself has spent most.of this
month in outlying areas, trying
to re-establish party control
over potential and actual

TALKS.

The 21-22 November talks
between Charles de Gaulle and
Ludwig Erha~d seem to have estab-
lished a good working. relation-
ship and clarified aspects of
France's and West Germany's
national policies, but produced
few decisions.

De Gaulle reportedly en-
couraged Erhard to take some
initiative toward a politically
united Europe, and Erhard re-
sponded that he would give the
matter sympathetic consideration.
In his public statements, how-
ever, Erhard again made it plain
that he favored a Europe rooted
in an Atlantic community rather
than the French-led third force
which De Gaulle envisages.

On defense questions, the
new German chancellor and the
veteran French chief of state
“agreed to disagree." De Gaulle
reportedly lectured Erhard on the
Gaullist view that France cannot
depend on the US but rather needs
its own nuclear force, while
Erhard publicly reaffirmed
Germany's trust in the protec-
tive shield of US military power.
Neither leader disparaged the
other's position, however, and

‘ De Gaulle is said to have assured

|

Erhard that France has no inten-
tion of forcing Bonn to choose
between Paris and Washington.

On the divisive and po-
litically treacherous issue of
agricultural integration in the

Europe

Common Market, some slight
progress was made. Neither
leader appeared prepared as yet
to accept the Mansholt plan
whereby a single community
grain price would be set between
the high German level and the
lower French level, but, accord-
ing to a German observer, they
agreed that the proposal offered
a good working basis. Implicit
in the relaxed atmosphere was
the suggestion that De Gaulle
now is willing to discuss the
grain issue beyond the year-
end deadline he had previously
set for final agreement on

EEC agricultural policy.

It was agreed, moreover,
that: EEC arrangements for beef,
dairy products, and rice be
completed by the end of December.
In addition, the communiqué
issued at the close of the
talks looked forward to the
successful conclusion of the
negotiations envisaged by the
US Trade Expansion Act.

Erhard and De Gaulle
throughout the talks apparently
maintained an air of cordiality,
but Erhard demonstrated ‘that he
was neither so innately sympa-
thetic to De Gaulle's views as
was Konrad Adenauer nor so
willing to play a secondary
role. Thus Erhard may have
served notice that a somewhat
sterner era for Franco-German
relationships has arrived.

ROPE'S STEEL PROBLEM

Coal-Steel Community (CSC) is
meeting on 2 December to deal
with the problems that afflict
the continental steel industry.

: | The session promises to have

| far-reaching implications for

\ the CSC's future as well as for

; the eventual outcome of inter-
national tariff negotiations
that are set for next spring.

The steel industry in the
Six now is running about 20
percent below capacity. More-
over, steel manufacturers have,
in recent months, suffered from
reductions in price that have
taken place both inside and out-
side the community, During the
past year, CSC officials have
advanced several possible solu-
tions to the problem—-~including
the promotion of both official
or private agreements with for-
eign producers to limit their
exports--but none of these has
proved effective,

More recently, the CSC has
been increasingly attracted to
the idea of raising tariffs,
but so far has not received
solid backing from the member
states for such a move, The
Council has also. been put on
notice by the US that a tariff
hike on an item so important
as steel would have grave polit-
ical and psychological conse-
quences on the forthcoming
tariff negotiations.

However, pressure for a
steel tariff hike or some oth-
er restrictive action again
seems to be building up, The
latest word from Paris, for
example, indicates that the

will support a tariff rise
that was proposed by Bonn three
months ago, If Paris and Bonn
see eye to eye on this, it is
probable that their tariffs. will
go up to 9 percent--the pres-
ent level in Italy. A restric-
tion on trade would primarily
affect Japan, Austria,' and the
UK, since the CSC already has
strict quotas on imports from
the bloc.

The political importance
of the steel tariff question
to the CSC has been generally
recognized in the community.
President Del Bo has intimated
to US officials that unless
the CSC can produce a Community-
wide solution to the challenge,
the CSC's very existence will
be threatened.

The CSC's failure to pro-
duce a solution to date, how-
ever, is indicative of its de-
eclining power and prestige.

Its governing body, the High
Authority, has, in theory, more
power than its counterpart in 1
the Common Market. But this

authority has sharply deteri- i
orated because of its failure
to exercise its ‘powers'and the
appointment of mediocre per-
sonnel to its staff. This
deterioration began in. 1958
when, under very smiliar cir-
cumstances, the High Authority
was unable to produce a solution
to the then serious glut in
coal, Should the member states
resort to urilateral solution
to the present problems in
steel, there would be little

left of the CSC--the first and
most supranational of the three
European communities, ‘ (CONFIDEN-
