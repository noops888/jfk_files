B.

SOVIET EMBASSY:

PROJECT LIEMPTY CONCERNED PRIMARILY

WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE OF THE SOVIET INSTALLATION. ACTIVE FROM

APPROXIMATELY MID-1955 THROUGH 30 JUNE 1972. AT THE TIME OF ITS

TERMINATION

IT SUPPORTED TWO OF THE THREE ORIGINAL BASEHOUSES

WHICH WERE:

SUSPENDED IN SEP 1964.

WHEN THE STATION DETERMINED THAT SAID

PHOTOGRAPH WAS SOURCED TO LIMITED, THE STATION REACTIVATED THE

LILYRIC AND LICALLA BASEHOUSES ON A PHASED BASIS IN OCTOBER 1964.

(CHANCERY),

15-69-81 (MILITARY ATTACHE), 16-61-07 (COMMERCIAL OFFICE) , AND

15-12-64 (FILM REPRESENTATIVE).

IN JULY 1963 LIENVOY COVERAGE WAS MAINTAINED ON FIVE

THAT LIENVOY COVERAGE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED ON 23 SEPTEMBER 1963 ON

TWO CUBAN EMBASSY LINES: 14092-14 AND 25-07=95.

COVERAGE ON

14-92-14 WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF ORDER, AND THE CUBANS

HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE TELEPHONE COMPANY TO REPAIR IT.

25-07=95 WAS SUSPENDED BECAUSE IT WAS LOCATED IN AN APARTMENT

WHICH HAD BEEN VACATED BY A CUBAN OFFICIAL AND THE CUBANS HAD NOT

YET SUCCEEDED IN HAVING IT TRANSFERRED TO THE CUBAN EMBASSY THAT

IS BECAUSE OF THE SUSPENSION OF COVERAGE OF THESE TWO LINES

LIENVOY WAS ONLY PROVIDING COVERAGE ON THREE CUBAN EMBASSY LINES

PRIOR TO APRIL 1964 LIENVOY COVERAGE WAS REACTIVATED ON THESE

TWO LINES (PRESUMABLY ONCE 14-92-14 HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND

25-07-95 HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE EMBASSYD, BUT THE EXACT DATE

OF THE RESUMPTION OF COVERAGE DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE RECORD.
