Dear Mr. Breckinridge:

In connection with its investigation into the circum-
stances surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy,
the Select Committee on Assassinations requests that the enclosed
two pages of John McCone's testimony before this Committee and the
enclosed eleven pages of Barney Hidalgo's executive session testi-
mony before this Committee both be declassified. Subject to the
Agency's declassification of this material, it will be entéred into
the Committee's public hearings record on Tuesday, September 26,
1978.

Regarding public disclosure of Mr. Hidalgo's name, please
note that the Committee does not intend to refer to or disclose
in any way Mr. Hidalgo's identity.

Since some of the information cited in this letter is derived
from classified information, consideration should be given to as-
signing this letter an appropriate classification indicator.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

COMMITTEE SENSITIVE

Mr. Scott Breckinridge
Principal Coordinator/HSCA
Office of Legislative Counsel
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, D. C. 20505

Dear Mr. Breckinridge:

I write in reference to the Committee's requests of 6
June 1978 and 8 June 1978 that the Central Intelligence Agency
make available for review by Committee staff members all files
and index references to the following individuals:

Luisa Calderon
AMMUG/1

During the week of 2 July 1978, various files concerning
the above~named individuals were made available for review to
Charles Berk of this Committee. Mr. Berk has now reviewed
Luisa Calderon's 201 file and AMMUG/1's Office of Security file,
Office of Personnel file, and Volumes One and Two of AMMUG/1's
201 file covering the period 25 April 1964 - October 1965.

After a careful review of these materials, it has been
determined that CIA-originated reports of 5 May 1964, 6 May
1964, 7 May 1964, 8 May 1964, 11 May 1964, and 19 June 1964,
each based upon AMMUG/1's knowledge, are absent from the
materials provided to Mr. Berk. Furthermore, neither notes nor
memoranda upon which these reports may have been based are
present in the files. The content of these reports, notes and
memoranda are of substantial interest to the Committee. It has
also been determined that AMMUG/1 material now stored by the
CIA at its Warrenton, Virginia facility has not been made fully
available to the Committee. This omission came to Mr. Berk's
attention inadvertently during a conversation that he had with
Chris Hopkins.

Mr. Berk's review of a 1 May 1964 CIA-originated dis-
patch also indicates that at least twenty-two reels of tape

Page 2, 1978 COMMITTEE SENSITIVE

\
recorded interviews conducted by CIA representatives with
AMMUG/1 are absent from the files provided thus far to the
Committee. These twenty-two reels of tape recordings were
listed as attachments to the above-referenced CIA dispatch.

The actual interviews from which the tape recordings were
generated were conducted shortly after AMMUG/1's defection

from the Cuban Intelligence Service. Furthermore, three trans~
scripts of tape recorded CIA interviews with AMMUG/1 are absent
from the files thus far provided to the Committee. These
transcripts were listed as attachments to a CIA-originated re-
port of 30 April 1964. The actual interviews upon which the
transcripts are based were also conducted shortly after AMMUG/1's
defection from the Cuban Intelligence Service.

In the case of Luisa Calderon's CIA files, CIA informa-
tional reports, cables, and dispatches referenced to in her 201
file have been found to be absent from that file. In addition,
a CIA transcript of a telephone conversation in which she par-
ticipated on the day of President Kennedy's assassination is
absent from her 201 file.

The absence of these reports, notes, memoranda, and other
Material from the AMMUG/1 files and the Luisa Calderon files
reviewed to date may be an indication that other related
materials have not yet been made available to the Committee for
review.

The Committee therefore reiterates its request that all
files and index references on Luisa Calderon and AMMUG/1, in-
cluding but not limited to production files, operational files,
soft files and subject files, be made available to the Commit~
tee as soon as possible.

The Committee further requests that AMMUG/1 CIA case
officers Harold Swenson, and Barney Hidalgo, FNU Langosch, and
Daniel Flores be made immediately available for personal inter-
views with Committee staff members.

As some of the matters discussed herein may be of a
sensitive or classified nature, this communication may require
appropriate classification.

Thank you for your continued cooperation.

Dear Mr. Carpentier:

In connection with its investigation into the circum-: __
stances surrounding the death of President Kennedy, the Select
Committee on Assassinations requests access to a report written
i by Bruce Solie in 1967. This report critiqued the 800 page
he report on Yuri Nosenko, prepared by the S. B. Division.

Because this report is derived from "Top Secret"
material, you might find it appropriate for the Agency to so
classify it. All copies of this letter held by this office

As in the past, and as we will continue to do in the
future, we_are making a basic assumption that your search and re-
sponse include all files and index references pertaining to any
and all registered or unregistered aliases and cryptonyms that
were used by, or assigned to, such persons.. We request further
that your search include all files that are centrally indexed
as well as those that are maintained in a non-centralized man-
ner. This search should specifically include, but not be
limited to, the Western Hemisphere Division files, the Office
of Security files, the Office of Personnel files, the Techni-
cal Services Division files, and the Office of Finance files.

Because item #38 above and the paragraph below are derived

the Agency to so classify them. All copies held by this office
have been marked "sensitive".

Finally, please be advised that the Committee will pro-
vide you shortly with the names of those staff members who are

Dear Mr. Cummins:

This letter is written in connection with our conversa-
tion on December 22, 1977, in reference to the classification
of correspondence between the Committee and the Agency.

I have carefully reviewed my letter of December 15, 1977,
which we discussed on Thursday, and have concluded that it
would be inappropriate to designate the letter as "sensitive",
or to mark it under Section 110 of the Committee's Security
Procedure as material that contains or reveals restricted
material.

I have also carefully reviewed my letter of December 20,
1977, making nine specific requests. It would be appreciated
if you would, in my behalf, designate that letter "sensitive".
Copies held here have been so designated. As you are aware,
however, the Committee has no lawful authority to classify
any document. Nevertheless, since item #5 in my letter of
December 20, 1977, is derived from materials designated "Top _
Secret", but neither contains nor reveals the contents of said.
material, it may be appropriate for the Agency, but not the
Committee, to so classify that item.

Similarly, I have carefully reviewed my letter of Decem-
ber 22, 1977, requesting access to eleven designated items and
several other files and materials. The paragraph beginning
"Finally" is derived from material designated "Top Secret",
but neither contains nor reveals the contents of said material;.
it may, therefore, be appropriate for the Agency, but not the
Committee, to so classify that item.

tegrity of materials the Agency has furnished the Committee.
