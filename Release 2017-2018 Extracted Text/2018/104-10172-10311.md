REDCAP 7
Grigorly Ye,GCLUB"and Costille Contact

None

1, On 18 February the undersigned was invited to lunch by Grigoriy
Ye GOLUB. The first overture was made by Golub during a Consular Corps
lunch lenon-on 12 February. Following this lunch, the group divided up
into smaller tables of seven or eight for coffee and cognac. Golub came
directly to Costille's table where the Canadian Vice Consul, the British
Vice Consul and two Finns were already sitting. His first words were
directed to Costille, Golub stated that ho would Like to invite Costille
to lunch some time but understood that it was against regulations for
Americans tc socialize with Soviets, He cited as an example the former
American Vice Consul's constant refusal to lunch with him. Costille
responded that this was a personal thing and that all Golub had to do was
to ask him, Golub promised that he would, A call was received on 16
February, and the date was set for 1200 hours on 18 February.

2, ‘Tne lunch lasted for three hours and took place at the Adlon
Restaurant, which 4s one of Golub's favorite restaurants in Helsinid. We
will report the whole conversation for whatever it is worth. As Golub
will have to sign Costille's visa to the USSH, Costille mentioned that he
was shortly (February 28th) planning a trip to Moscow and Leaingrad on a
guided tour and would like any advice Golub had as to the best restaurants
and night spots to visit in these cities, Golub said that he was aware of
Costille's trip, as his visa request had to pase through him. He stated
that it was an excellent idea for Costilie to go to the Soviet Union, and
gave him two or three restaurants in each city. He again brought up the
Assue of Americans abroad refusing to have contact with Soviets, He stated
that he understood our feeling because of the Hungarian incident, but felt

that this was a long time ago and should be forgotten, He, felt the more
*Yhole world would

the Soviets and Americens brow, ether the better off
be, He cited as an example Gepanes/3 tripy, (See OFHA}3748, para 3,

6 Feb. 1959) He then proceeded to describe GE/3 to Costille and asked if
Costille had met her before. Costille answered that he had once or twice
at Embassy functions, as he had all Fulbrignters, but that he did not know
her personally, Golub was evidently very impressed with Qiy39%etating that
ahe knew Russian and had a sincere desire to learn more ebout the Soviet
Union, He added that the trip was expensive but (A8/3 was borrowing the
money from her parents and was planning to pay it bad once she got a job.
Golub thought her trip was an excallent thing.

The conversation turned to comparative Foreign Services. Golub
stated that he is allowed one paid vacation to Moscow a year. However, if
he wants to take any more vacations, he has to pay for them himself, He

cited as an example his wife's recent trip to Moscow where she visited her
sick mother, This he personally had to psy for, as they had already used
up their one paid vacation. Golub stated he could not afford a car and

that he had to pay for his apartment out of his salary and was not given a
rent allowance. (The Golubs still have no children but are very desirous

of having a family.)
4. Golub was quite proud of his war record during the Second World
War, He then stated what a terrible thing it would be to have another war

because of nuclear weapons. He felt that the Scviet Union end the U.S,,
even with different systems, could find a way to live together peacefully,

things. At no time did Golub appear urset or surrrised at Costillets
asking such cuestions and was always prenared with a quick answer. He
is quite knowledgeable and conversant on Marxisn/Leninisa,

5. During the lunch Golub made a rumber of references to the amount
of work he had and complained that he cid not have more help at the Soviet
Consulate, ‘He stated thet his enly este assistant was Lrubinov (evidently
Mikhail Petrovich Lyubimov) who was only in the Consulate-part time. He
stated that this was Lyubimov's “rst zssicment outside of the USSR and
that he wes quite young and naive, though very intelligent, Lyubimov
speaks Shglish and Swedish, Golub stated that Lyubinov was quite shy. and
was apprehensive. about going out and meeting peorle. Golub stated that
Lyubinov had a fiancee in Moscow end appeared quite lonely here without

her.

6, Golub is extremely congenial end likeable and enjoyed playing the
part of the host. His Finnish is excellent and he claims to ‘know no English.
However, when Costille was having difficulty with Finnish, Golub was able
to put these English words into Finnish, He picked up the tab for the meal
but undoubtedly will be reimbursed as he put the bill into his pocket.

74 when Costille appeared worried stout getting his visa in time for
the trip on 28 February, Golub stated mot te worry that he would personally
see that the visa cane through in time. Golub phoned Costille cn Saturday
at the Bebassy to tell him that all the visas of the Anericans making the
trip were returned from Moscow approved. He stated thet ne had made a phone
call to Xoscow requesting they hurry the visas up, Otherwise, we would have
never received our vises in time, accoréing to Goltb. Golub then invited
Costille to be his guest at the Soviet~Finnish ice hockey gane in Helsinkd
on 22 February, Costille accepted, Notting of importance was done or seid
at the game except that Golub apreared ouite upset when the Finns around
him cheered whenever a Soviet player fel! or was knocked down,

8. Golub phoned Costille on 26 Febreary wanting Costille to have lunch
again with him before his departure to Moscow on 22 Februzry. Costille de-
clined because of previous engagments. Golub wished Costille a pleasant

Journey and pronised to call Costille when the letter returned,
