aspects

of politics, military plannins, strategical planning and

other such

matters

He was considered by the soviets to be

a very serious man

who could be relied upon and who was true

to his word.

This latter was particularly pieasing to the

Soviets since they do not like statesmen who frequently

change their minds and their statements. Kennedy was the
