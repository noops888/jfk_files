a group of Fascists, yery American, ‘he is omer of a Cabaret of | nudists 4
and belongs to political gangsters. | Cecilia says it is absurd that | | {
they let him enter (Ruby entering Jail where OSWALD was). Julieta says
he (Ruby) vas thdre from the first day, that he began to mix with the |
police and news: ypermen . It wds perfectly Planned, indeed some of the :
police probably are of the same organization ‘because Ruby putxkhoxeen '
aimed the gun at his chest (OSWALD's). ;

| Cecilia agrees, the picture is evidence of that because the police

did not: move to try to get in or anything for within a question of |

| seconds there should have been a redction. Julieta hopes they will = = |

continue the: investigation; at least Kemnedy 's brother hes sent a special

: agent. Cecilia says everything about it is strange as the paper stated
they found this character (Ruby) drinking Coca Cola on the second floor

and they just left bin there. Julieta adds that from the £ very first

everything wes absurd, thet he wes a Communist. Cecilia says this type |
(OSWALD) could net be’ nuts! because the whole thing was'so perfectly | i
planned | and that is evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy. |
Julieta believes that this|1s all done by extreme rightists planned from |
very high up and ‘that is why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't talk.)
Julieta adds that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business

' and pay; attention to what has happened because it is evident it.is all a|

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men. She adds that in a very,

' obvious | ‘way this ‘individual (OSWALD) pretended he was a Communist to!

prepare the groundwork, Cecilia believes that he even purposely married
the Russian girl: Julieta, comments that all wes very well prepared, :
step by step to blame the Communists, but thet now with this (OSWALD's |
death) everything is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the ;
investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death of

the case was closed, put the FBI answered domediately that it, was , '
not closed, that ion the contrary, they had to open an dnvestigation and !
also the Senate will name « commission to investigate, and Julieta hopes |
they wea't be aldrmed|at whatever may be turned up. She adds that each |_
time more details m confirm that OSWALD was 4 Fascist and this business of
trying to Jdin an anti-Castro organization and later poke his nose into |
the Fair Flay for Cube surely all of this vas made up by the Dalles police.
Likewise she indieates that all the! speeches igiven t : , :
(OSWALD). fanatics elso NIXON spoke to the Pe
stop this tendency toward violence . :
NIXON has made a stand es & good and hate. ¢ Sectlie a de ogtentaned, thet

i MEXI Tob Amb Mam |esks' that following be passed to Seo. Rusk. He poelewaed KURARK sid
| ODBNVY will be sdviged, Since mylcable of yesterday (MEXI 7072 -. para 97 above)! thexp have
been three principal developments: 1) Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 5 bre last evening | a
DORTICOS of Cuba. In this conversation, which like the first iis taped, | erie
i : continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia jabout money.
: ' | : 2) ALVARADO, the Nic, was questioned by CAS officer’ until two a.m, this m ing, 8
: : : officer was impressed by: ALVARADO ' who has offered make himself available as ie witness: and
who is now hiding in place provided by: CAS.! We icannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety. Wealth
of deteil ALVARADO gives about events and persoalities involved with OSWALD in b Emb |
is striking. 3) At 1215 brs Mexi time 27 Nov. CAS| officer was ed A saad a .
ECHEVERRIA that he had rearrested Silvia today because he learned she was attempt
leave Mexi for Habana. However, Echeverria later told LEGAT thet he had de ‘geal ten rearraet
Siivia to avoid any ‘possibility she might. escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as a Io.
witness, Since we had received no reply to yesterday's teleprem (MEXI 7OT2 - para oT. above)
we have not requested Mexi gov to take g any action against Silvia: except to maintain, :
increased surveillance of her activities. Echeverria later denied'to LEGAT that ‘he had any
specific concrete evidence that she was about to leave for Cuba, We do not ‘now know which
Echeverria statements are accurate, It is quite possible, and even probable, that eontra-
dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire iof GOM to play down importance
of OSWALD visit, here, Mexi line stillis that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.
j Consistent with this Echeverria stated’ to LEGAT that DORTICOS ‘only: interested in finding |
out whether Mexi authorities tried to pay a story from Silvia. This is. obviously inerorrect
interpretation.’ Neither’ LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's' story. Pls note |
e. | that according Echeverria Silvia is being taken ito Attorney General's office to which |
: Mexi press has easy ‘access. Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be, (discounted. 4) We
have as yet found no trace of the ‘red headed Cub negro desoribed. by ALVARADO, put are: :
: continuing.our search for him, 5) In addition ‘to.questions raised in yesterday's telegram
: : Washington should urgently consider feasibility of requesting Mexi: ‘authorities to arrest a
+t : : for interrogations Euseblo AZCUE; Luise CALDERON and Alfredo MIRABAL. . The two men are

MEMO to Boonstra, ce to COS from LEGAT; Subject: OSWALD - It is to be noted. that the White :
House was in receipt of a paper entitled "Possible Psychological Motivations in the Assassine-
tion of Pres. Kennedy" written by Jose I. LASAGA of Miami, Fle. This speculative paper attempted ©
to establish that the motivation of OSWALD in the assassination of Pres K was Fidel CASTRO

or @ CASTRO agent and that OSWALD was motivated during his trip to Mexi between 27 Sept and

2 Oct 63. The paper alleged that OSWALD held an extended interview with the Cuban Amb in

Mexi whom he met in e restaurant on the outskirts of Mexi from which restaurant they both
later left in the Amb's car for a talk without being overheard./ Source of this latter info
was alleged to be Salvador DIAZ Verson. This individual was interviewed at Miami. He stated
that while in Mexi 29-29 Nov 63 attending the Congress of the International Federation of
Professional Newspaper Organizations, he was at the offices of the newspaper Excelsior on

the night of 25 Nov 63. ‘There he learned through the Mexi press that the Mexi gov had arrested
one Silvia DURAN; that DURAN allegedly had OSWALD as a guest in her house during his visit

to Mexi; and that DURAN placed OSWALD in contact with officials of; the Cub Emb in Mexi. /

DIAZ Verson went on to claim that he was @ told by Dr. BORRELL Navarros, an exiled Cuban
newspaperman employed by Excelsior, that OSWALD and DURAN on the day following OSWALD's arrival
in Mexi went to a restaurant called the Caballo Blanco or possibly: the Caballo Bayo where they
met an official of the Cub Emb. DIAZ Verson claimed that he knows nothing about OSWALD and

the Cub official leaving the restaurant togather in a car. / It was ascertained that Dr. .
Eduardo BORRELL Navarry, a former Cuban Cabinet Minister who on occasion writes feature
articles for the Mexi City Excelsior, currently resides at 1303 Homero St., Apart 301, Mexi.

Salvador DIAZ Verson was in Mexi as claimed and discussed OSWALD with BORRELL and other Cuban
exiles. DIAZ Verson also visited BORRELL in BORRELL's home. / BORRELL did not tell the story
credited to him by DIAZ Verson concerning the visit to a Mexi City restaurant by OSWALD and
Silvie DURAN. BORRELL had never heard this story or any similar story before. / SORRELL knew

of no meeting between OSWALD and Cub Emb officials other than the meetings which’ occurred:

at the time OSWALD visited the Cub Con in Mexi. / BORRELL knew nothing concerning any visit

by OSWALD to the home of DURAN. / It is to be noted that DURAN was questioned by Mexi authorities

have been observed indicate by postmark that ROJAS was in Cozumel, butma at a later period

mamer reflecting innate intelligence superior to that of his stated sixth grade education. /
He does not volunteer any motive for furnishing info to the U. S. Gov concerning his alleged
: association with unidentified Cubans and with OSWALD, both at U.S. border and at Cozumel.

apparently unusual development concerns a reportedly second letter that he has directed to

: that he had additional info to furnish. According to ROJAS, this additional info concerned
@ so-called camera which. he saw in Cozumel in the possession of the unidentified Bubans and
OSWALD, which camera reportedly had adaptations which could be utilized to fire about five
: cartridges, which cartridges reportedly have a small gas compartment and that said gas was
\ . for the purpose of cutting down on the noise made in firing said camera. He also described :

MEMO to COS from JKBENADUM (source); Source has been told to drop everything else and concentrate
on Betty MORA to endeavor to find out any additional info which she might have re OSWALD and
his activities on behalf of the Fair Play For Cuba Committee in New Orleans, La. prior to

the assassination. (See para 264 above) In this connection it will be recalled that MORA
Stated after the death of the President that she hoped that the FBI would not look too hard

in New Orleans because it could be very bad"for us". / Source also reported that Reva BERNSTEIN,
former Chairman of the FPFCC in Detroit, Mich., has been in Mexi for more than a month, that
she had been in Puerto Vallarta for a month, that she had wanted to go to Playa Azul but

that she did not do so because "it was not good to do so - so soon after the assassination",
that she was leaving Mexi to go to Zijuatenejo. Source does not believe she wes in Puerto
Vallarta, nor that she is presently in Zijuatenejo. / BERSTEIN also told source that she had
been questioned in Detroit, prior to her departure ror Mexi, by tne RCMP, but that no inquiry
had been made of her by the FBI or any U.S. police or investigative agency. The interroga-
tion had to do with the FPFCC, its activities in the Detroit area, and the fact that she had
reportedly acted as a mail drop for Canadian communists. This interrogation took place in

the office of her lawyer in Detroit. She admitted to source that she had, in fact, acted as
adrop, but that she told the RCMP that she had merely acted as the addressee for "progressive
publications" for her Canadian friends.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION, )10 Dec 65) between Elena GARRO de Paz and Charles Thouss, Folsttoal

Officers On 25 Dec Elena discussed her alleged encounter with OSWALD. Also! present were |

Thomas' wife, and Elena's daughter, Elenita. Further info was given subsequently: on g Jan; 66.

During this latter conversation, Elena admitted she had gone to AmEmb on an earlier occasion

with her daughter and mother-in-law and talked to two Emb officers (presumably from LEGAT) jabout

this matter. She said since the Emb officers did not give much credence to anything they said,

they did not bother to give a very complete story. The following info supplements and in |

some instances corrects that given in the memo of Dec.10. /1. Lydia, Horacio, and Ruben.

DURAN are all cousins of Elena, Silvia is married to: Horacio, a weak man, who: was converted

to Communism by Ricardo GUERRA. Elena has nothing to do with Silvia whom she detests and |

considers a whore. Ruben was born in U.S. and served in U.S. army during war. «'. .Paaity wes

held at home of Ruben. / Elena believes date of party’ was 2 or 3 Sept 635, few days before

visit of Sov astronaut, Gagarin, but is not sure of date.../ At the party OSWALD wore @ black

sweater. He tended to be silent and stared at the floor. Two young American companions, ©

one was very tall and slender and had long blond hair wtk which hung across forehead, gaunt

face and long protruding chin; other was tall, short light brown hair.. ALL bree: we:

obviously Americans and did not mix or dance with other people. The three were frien By

because Elena saw them by cliance the next day walking, down the street toget ir. / Alt

Elena had returned from Europe in June or July, she had already met Eusebio } and [Inows «
positively he was at party. On another occasion (not. clear whether before after the party
in question), she attended a party where she saw’ Eusebio AZCUE; Emilio C. IDO; and a Latin |
American negro man with red hair. (These last 2 were: not et the DURAN party 8s Ping stated
in the 10 Dec memo.) CARBALLIDO and AZCUE, with others, were in heated disc on that:

occasion about Kennedy and they came to conclusion that the only solution ta 11 ‘him,
Elena said CARBALLIDO is known as a Castro agent; he had been to Red China, Sov Union,’ and’ !

times to Cuba. Following assassination he spent. a year in Cuba, then got a job teaching '
at Rutgers Universidy through Dr. Jose VASQUEZ Amaral, formerly with Rockefeller Foundation
in N.Y. and who is now a £ professor at Rutgers. The day after assassination, Elenita
encountered Sra. de AZCUE in Sanborns. On seeing her, Sra. de. AZCUE hurried | out of store.
AZCUE was called back to Habana after assassination and his wife followed shortly... / FF

this Subj of 25 Dec 65 ~ para 427 above) Participants ~ Elena and Thomas (Pol Officer) -
Elena described some developments which may have some bearing on her claim that she saw
OSWALD at @ at home of her cousin Ruben DURAN when OSWALD was in Mexico prior to
assassination. / Elena said Carlos SOLORZANO is well acquainted with Cub Amb HERNANDEZ
Armas, and that he was not leftist but his brother, Alfonso, was a Communist. Amb HERANEDEZ
told SOLORZANO he wanted to meet Elena, so SOLORZANO arranged a party at his own home on
30 June 66 and invited both of them. Also present were Tito MONTZROSO and his wife;
Elvira VARGAS, leftist journalist with NOVEDADES and personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Check Blenats friends and story, Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin DIAZ Ganedo, head of publishing firm
called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, painter, who was invited to make her feel at
LICgANT/1 22? Info from him??? ease, since he is a friend of hers and was the only anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening, Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she described as intelligent and cultured, concen-

trated his attention on her..... and expressed interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He issued a personal invitation to her to attend the annual literary festival of the Casa

de las Americas in Havana. She said she was not a Fidelista and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro regime over the objections of the others present..... / Later, her friend,

Vietor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned her not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On k July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre in

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Americas in Havana. The first letter, written last October (667) gave her address

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written in April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

The envelope for the first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

sender, which was the Cub Emb here. The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments, / Elena stated the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was because she spent several

eRe days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination. The correct address of the hotel is

Seuss. Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address. / Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensibly to
protect her from the Communists, this raised the question of how the Cubans obtained that GE,

: CALVILLO and two close friends of his, Ernesto de la Pefia and Margarita MICHE |
other friends of these three who might have learned of it are Eunice ODIO and J s cane. |
She « has always been suspicious of all three because they went out of their way to | :

placed outside her home when she returned from the Hotel Vermonth....../ Elena thowent eat
possible that the Cub Emb had deliberately given her the letters from the Casa las
Americas with the Vermont Street address in order to frighten her. She was ady leon- |
cerned about what appeared to be three gunshots that had been fired through her! upstairs |
window while she was out of the house three weeks ago. .../ Finally, Elena said abe had |
recently encountered her cousin, Lydia H DURAN and that the latter had been very friendly
and wanted to meet her again. She said Lydia was very poor and had a small job with '

Transportes Frontera terminal in Mexi, was interviewed several times, the last being on
17 Dec, ALVARADO had no recollection of OSWALD and could offer no explanation as to why no
ticket number appeared beside his name or as to the reason for the discrepancy in the number
discrepancy in number of of passengers listed for Laredo, / / As previously reported, Francisco SAUCEDO Velez snd
passengers © Dionisio REYNA Paz, chauffeurs on the trip.... were interviewed. They had no personal recollec-
. tion of OSWALD nor could they offer any explanations concerning the discrepancy in the number
: of passengers and the fact that no ticket number appeared beside OSWALD's name. / SOUCEDO
explained that tickets bearing a prefix of 39 covered travel from Mexi to Monterrey and those
with a prefix of 10 covered the travel from Mexi to Nuevo Laredo. He also pointed out that
tickets collected from,the passengers on a given trip are forwarded to the offices of the bus
company in Monterrey. 7 On 9 Dec Telesforo QUIROGA, ticket agent at Transportes Frontera
office, Monterrey was interviewed. All tickets listed by number on the passenger manifest
1 for the 2-3 Oct 63 trip from Mexi to Nuevo Laredo were located. QUIROGA could offer no
explanation as to why no ticket number was listed for OSWALD, and it was impossible for him
to locate a ticket which might have been used by OSWALD. / OSWALD in Mexi stayed at Hotel del
Comercio, Calle Sahagun 19. On 20 Jan # 64 Guillermo GARCIA Luna, manager of this hotel,
reported:b The hotel does not use a system of registration cards for guests, but rather uses @
a & registry book. On the first day a guest arrives he, himself, makes the initial entry
in the book, this including the name of the guest, the place from which he is arriving, his
occupation, and his nationality. Thereafter on each day the guest continues at the xk hotel
the same info is entered in the book on the page designated for that day, but the entry is
made by a hotel employee. ...Guests pay in advance. OSWALD registered on 27 Sept, arriving
being shown as "USA (Texas)", occupation "photo" and nationality was "U.S. citizen". Hand-
writing on this entry in the registry book has been identified with kmown handwriting of OSWALD
by the FBI. / OSWALD was listed as staying in room 18 from 27 Sept through night of 1 Oct.
My. GARCIA Luna said rooms 18 through 23 occupy one floor of the hotel. He was able to furnish
info on three of the guests who occupied rooms on same floor as OSWALD because they frequently
stop at the hotel when in Mexi. Guests were: Mr. PEREZ Pliego, San Luis Potosi, railroad
employee, room 19 on 26 Sept, 27 and 28 Sept. A Captain ESQUIVEL of Veracruz occupies room
19 on 30 Sept, Mexi Army Captain well-knowm in Veracruz according to GARCIA Luna. / Mario
RESENDIZ, merchant, Saltillo, Coahuila, room 21,26 Sept to 3 Oct., has merchandising business
involving sale of flowers and miscellaneous items in Monclova, Coahuila, algo well known in
Monclova according to GARCIA Luna. / / On 21 Jan 64 Alfonso PEREZ Pliego, Espana 304,
Guadalajara, Jalisco, office address Bolivar 8-401, Mexi, was interviewed in Mexi. He advised

304, 27 Feb. MEMO to LEGAT from COS: Subject: RUBY - Info available to this office fails to confirm
that RUBY left Mexi for Habana or arrived in Mexi from Habana by air anytime during 1962.

505. 10 Mar. MEMO from LEGAT to Boonstra, ce to COS; Subject: OSWALD. - Ref: LEGAT memo dated 13 Jan

64 (para 277 above) - Same background info as para 277 with following additional; ROJAS
! claimed he could pinpoint the date 14 August 1962 as the day he arrived in Mexi because he
sat in seat #14 on the’ bus and his hotel room was #14 and he arrived in Mexi, by coicidence,
What hote1?? on 14 Aug 62. (That dey, while waiting in a park near the bus station of the busline Estrellas

de Oro, and the hotel where he sayed was in the vicinity, he was contacted by an unidentified
individual, who he later learned was a Cuban. He saw this Cuban over a period of two days
and this Cuban proposed that ROJAS help him in smuggling Cuban propaganda to Mexico.) /
corel ff / Details on interrogations concerning ROJAS, SOLIS, etc., ended up (page 22 of
report from LEGAT) with "On 5 Mar 64, ROJAS, at Guadalajara, Jalisco, continued to maintain
that he hed met OSWALD at Nuevo Laredo and again later at Cozumel, as he hed previously
declared; however, subsequently on that day he orally admitted that he had never know or
met OSWALD anywhere," / A written, signed statement declaring all information had been false
was prepared and signed by ROJAS,

6. 12 Mar. MEMO to COS from LEGAT: Subject: OSWALD, Source produced original of a passenger list
or manifest relating to departure No. 2, Bus No. 340, 2 Oct 63, of the Transportes Frontera,
S.A. de C, V. bus line, which has its headquarters in Monterrey, N. L. and its Mexi terminal
at Buenavista Street No. 7. / The passenger list or manifest was clear evidence that
OSWALD had departed from Mexi on the bus connected therewith which left Mexi at 1:00 p.m.
and scheduled to have arrived at Nuevo Laredo, Tamps, (across border from Laredo, Texas)
at 5:30 a.m., 3 Oct 63. / Info on passenger list is handwritten, not complete and not all
legible, etc....(report submitted typed list of passengers, seat number, ticket number and
destination, etc.)..."Inquiry at Transportes Frontera Bus Terminal" - On 5 March 64,
Gilberto LOZANO Guizar advised that he is the Manager of the Mexi Terminal of Transportes
Frontera Bus Company, Buenavista #7, which hes a franchise for :"through service" between
Mexi, Monterrey and Laredo, but is not permitted to sell tickets or pick up passengers at
intermediate localities. / LOZANO said that Transportes Frontera had made a complete study
of its records and procedures and has now arrived at the conclusion that the person designated
a ee 2 : > : a8 "QSWLD"-on the 2-Oet 63 passenger manifest did not purchase a ticket and-could not have
traveled on the trip to which it relates. He pointed out that the list of passenger reserva-
. tions, tickets sold, and passengers actually boarding the bus in Mexi are recorded on the
form which is provided for that purpose and is maintained on a clip board on the counter
EI from which ticket sales normallly are made by the ticket salesman and dispatcher, Francisco 16S.
SECR a ALVARADO. He admitted that ALVARADO occasionally is assisted during rush hours or a tempor- . >
: ary absence from the counter by the baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ Medina, who may receive *
: and record reservations on the manifest but does not handle the actual receipt of payment

SECRET

26. (continued) for tickets. / According to Mr. LOZANO, @ reservation is recorded by assigning a seat
numberas available and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination
of the individual requesting the reservations. That reservation is respected under normal
conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event all seats are not
filled, it may be held until the actual departure of the bus. Prior to the departure of
the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that
particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communicates by radio to the company
headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus in relation to the
Monterrey or Laredo, destinations for which they purchased tickets, / Francisco. ALVARADO,
ticket salesman and d{épatcher for Transportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of
the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name "OSWLD" and destination "Lered”
appear opposite Seat No. 4. He stated that he did not write the "OSWLD" reservation info
and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and the info recorded by the
baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ. ALVARADO is quite certain at the present time that the
individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchase a ticket and did not travel
on the trip relating to that manifest. No ticket number was recorded for that person, and
a search of the company’s records in Monterrey had failed to locate a ticket stub which
vid OSWALD Res trip to Laredo was not otherwise accounted for in connection with that particular trip. / The notations

m 2 Oct.?? ‘ by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, 7 Monterrey" reflected that he had reported by radio to the
A % Monterrgy office of the company that the bus had departed with nine "paying" passengers
.< for Laredo and seven "paying" passengers destined for Monterrey. Listed under "Name of
woe & Passengers" were "OSWLD" with no ticket number, indicating he did not travel; "Angel PEREZ"
&e o y with no ticket number or destingtion, which confirmed that he had not purchased a ticket
oe and had not boarded the bus; and "Nicolas GONZALEZ" Seat No. 10, listed as having traveled
& on a pass to Torreon. /.../ ALVARADO and Gilberto LOZANO stated that the notations on
Nn the back of the manifest referred to advances of funds made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the
cash for repairs, parts or other requirements, They related that the passenger lists
are not kept as a permanent record, and, when the manifest was located in the "trash"
at the request of investigators of the Mexi Presidential Staff, the Blanks at the tope
of the form had not been filled.in as to time, destination, trip number, bus number, and
date, but they had completed those blanks from their personal knowledge in order to make
that data clear to the investigators. They also had listed the names of the drivers on the
formax at that time, They affirmed that the handwritten "Transportes Frontera" at the top
of the document had been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document
was borrowed from them, / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection of
ees . ° - : OSWALD, etc......they could. offer no explanation as to how Mexican.authorities had arrived
at the conclusion that OSWALD had travelled on the Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Oct 63,
but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had not been given
an opportunity of reviewing, analyzing or checking out the data thereon. / Lucio LOPEZ
Medina, baggage and freight handler at Transportes, related that he often assists the
SECRET ticket salesman by recording reservations and is quite certain that he wrote the "OSWLD" fo,
Mien and "LARED" opposite Seat No. 4 on the passenger manifest of 2 Oct 63. He stated that he
also hed recorded the reservations and ticket sales to "FCO. SAUCEDO” one of the drivers,
