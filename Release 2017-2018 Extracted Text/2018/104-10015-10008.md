premeditated, they let him (OSWALD) be killed. CARAM says did you see

or did he plan to return to the States first and then leave Inter.

26 Sept OSWALD crossed border by Ill Nuevo Laredo, Tamps., the following

day to Next City by road.

On 27 Sept he went to Cuban Consulate General

to request visa to transit Cuba because he was going to atri go to Moscow

VIa: Habana, Consul Fusebio AZCUs told OSWALD that he would have to

consult his government, that the paper work required 10 to 12 days.

OSWALD, because of his Irritable charaoter, beoame annoyed with AZCUE

and left the office slamming the door.

On

28 Sept OSWALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union to request a vias for Hussie.

He said

in helping his case, that his wife was a Sov oitizen; that he was &

militant Communist and hnd lived three yrs In Russia. OSWALD told the

So Consul that he could verily this quiokly by calling his wife who was

at that time in New Orleans In a hotel.

The Sor Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case like this

would take from three to four months.

OSWALD again became annoyed as he

had the day before in the Cuban Embassy and left the office very mad.

OSWALD returned to Texas on 3 Oct via the border of Nuevo Inredo, Tampe.

no this could not be true because one was & Jew, that it 1s definitely

a group of fasolsts, very American, he is owner of & Cabaret of nudiste

and belongs to politioal gangaters. Cecilia says it is absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering jail where OSWALD was). Julieta says

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with the

police and newspapermen.

It was perfectly planned, indeed some of the

police probably are of the same organization because Ruby mukhyu

Kostickhere thickx aimed the gun at his chest (OSWALD's).

Cecilin agrees, the ploture is evidence of that becmuse the police

did not move to try to get in or anything for within & question of

seconds there should have been a reaction.

Julieta hopes they will

continue the Investigation; at least Kennedy's brother has sent a special

agent.

Ceollia says everything about it is strange as the paper stated

they found this charmeter (Ruby) drinking Coca Colm on the second floor

and they just left him there. Juliet adds that from the & very first

everythiny was absurd, that he was a Communist.

Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned and that 1e evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

Julieta belleves that this 1s all done by extreme rightists planned from

very high up and that is why they had to klll OSWALD so he couldn't talk.

Julieta adds that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business

She adds that in a rem

obvious way this Individual (OSWALD) pretended he was & Communist to

prepare the groundwork. Cecilia believes that he even purposely married

the Russian girl. Julieta couments that all was very well prepared,

step by step to blans the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD's

death) everthine is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the

investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death of

OSWALD the case was closed, but the FBI ansvered immediately that 1t was

not closed, that on the contrary, they had to open an investigation and

also the Senate will name e commission to Investigate, and Julleta hopes

they won't be alarmed at whatever may be turned up.

She adds that ench

time more detaile is confirm that OSWALD ves a Fascist and this business of

trying to Join an anti-Castro organization and later poke his nose into

the Fair Play for Cube surely all of this was made up by the Dallas police.

Ilkewise she Indientes that all the speeches given try to imply that he

(OSHALD) was a fenatios also NIXON spoke to the peoples of the Nation to

NIXON has made a stand as a good person.

now everyone is frightened since they have seen just to what extent these

things can lappen. She hopes they continue the Investigation to the end!

ind, if things loome out, that she hopes the pubile will be shaken ur

so that they will stop this tendency toward Fasoism. Julieta continues

that et the beginning she thought it was caused by racial trouble but

now she thinks it 1s something more than thats 1t 1s a national thing

well planned and that OSWALD was not just acting spontaneously.

agrees, indeed it was a perfect shot with enct calculation and could not

anve been done spontaneously. Julieta says that his (OSWALD'g) death

as evidently to shut him up and they had better not say now that Ruby

was at the monent emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because Ruby 1a the

type who could pever be piotured asa great patriot since he has a

criminal record. Cecilie believes that Jehason (Pres.) and all those

people are paying attention to the strength in this:

Juliete is sure

of this and adds that the news (press) was rediculous in respect to

OSWALD in that he went to marry a Fussien, later was photographed with the

Dally Workers with the Conmuniet newspaper in one hand and & Iroskylat

one in the other hand; thus everything was very well prepared to blame

the leftists, indeed this has always been the way they have done it,

commit the terrorist sots and then try to make it appear that the acte

were done by the Coumnists; that has always been the tactle and only

the people that have no iden about politics can swallow those things.

She adds that this is very dangerous, indeed when they are able to assassinate

a president like Kennedy, Imagine how strong they are in the United States.

DIR 84938 - Since U.S. Imnigration records next to nothing on travel

of U.S. citizens, pls ask Mext Immigration to check all their records

since June 62, when OSWALD returned from Sov Union, to see 1f he entered

We still

do not know what if anything OSWAlD told his Dillas Interrogators about

travel to lexi. We lalso need info on tho traveled with him and what

In view of Nie (Ref A) and into in long distance telephone between DORTICOS and HERNANDEZ (Ref B)

we suggest Mexicans be inforued concerning Ref A and Nie be put at disposition of LOPEZ

Mateos on condition LOPEZ Mateos w1ll agree to order| rearrest and interrogate Silvia DURAN as

follows!

a) Confront Silvia with Nie and have Wie Inform her of detatle his statement

to us.

b) Tell Siviin she only living non-Cuban who knows full story and hence in same

position as OSWALD prior to his assassination; her only chance for survival is to come

clean with whole story and to cooperate completely with Moxi Gov in return for Mexi Gov

protection. c) She will not in any case be allowed to leave Mexi. / Given apparent

character of Silvia there would appear to be good chance of her orreking when confronted

with details of deal between OSWALD, AZCUS, MERABAL and Silvid and unknown Cubm negro.

If she did brenk - and we suggest Mexicans should be asked to go mi1 out in seeing that

she does - we and Mexicans would have needed corroboration of statement of the Nie

Also suggest Maxi Gov identify and arrest unknown negro.

Have Mexicans rearrest Silvia

so as to eliminate possibility of her being smuggled out of Mexi to Cube or killed here.

We lack established rellability of Nio, but suggest that DORTICOS" preoccupation with

money angle tends to corroborate authenticity of Nic statement. Thus, there appears

MEXI 7104 Amb Mam asks that following be passed to Sec. Rusk. He presumes KUBARK and

ODENVY will be advised. Since my cable of yesterday (MEXT 7072 - para 97 above) there have

been three principal developuents: 1) Amb HERNANDEZ. Armas at 1839 hrs last evening called

DORTICOS of Cube, In this conversation, which Ilke the first 1s taped, DORIICOS expressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia about money.

2)

ALVARADO, the No, was questioned by CAS officer until two a.m, this morning.

This

officer was impressed by: ALVARADO who has offered mike himself available as a witness and

who is now hiding in place provided by CAS.! We cannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety.

Wealth

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities Involved with OSWALD In Cub Emb

is striking. 3) At 1215 hrs Nexi time 27 Nov., CAS officer was admised by phone by

ECHEVERRIA that he had rearrested Silvia today because he lemrned she was attempting to

leave Next for Habana.

However, Echeverrin later told LEGAT that he had decided to rearrest

Silvia to avoid any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and Inter be unavailable as a

witness.

Since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above)

we have

not requested Mexi gov to take y any action against Silvie except to mintain

Inoreased surveillance of her activities.

Echoverria Inter denied to LEGAT that he had any

specifio concrete evidence that she was about to leave for Cuba.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It 1s quite possible, and even probable, that contra-

dictory statements mide by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down Importance

of OSWALD visit here.

Mext Iine still is that OSWALD visit related aolely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGAT that DORTICOS only interested in finding

out whether Nerd authorities tried to pay a story fron Silvia. This is obviously incorrect

Interpretation. Neither LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria know of ALVARADO's story.

pis note

that according Echeverrid Silvia Is being taken to Attorney General's office to which

Mexi press has easy access. Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted. 4) We

have as yet found no trace of the red headed Cub negro desoribed by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him.

5) In addition to questions raised In yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently consider feasibility of requesting lost authorities to arrest

for interrogation: Eusebio AZCUE; Luisa CATTERON and Alfredo MIRABAL. The two men are

Cuban nationals and Cuban consular officers. Luisa CALIERON 18 a de secretary in Cuban

consulate here. In this connection artiole II of Consular Convention between U. S. and Mexi

exempts from arrest "Consular offfoers, national of the state by which they are appointed,

and not engaged in any private occupation for gain" except "when charged with the comission

of an act designated by local legislation as crime other than misdemeanor and subjecting

the individual guilty thereof to punishment by imprisonment." We are checking to see whether

all of these Individuls are on current consular list. Even assuming they are, and assuming

also that Cuben-Mexican consular convention is sintlar to ours, they would all seem to be

with OSWALD as a

eliminate any possibility that Moxi Gor could use them as witnesses. We know that AZCUs

went to Habana on 18 Nov and we are not now certain that he or others are In Mexi at

present time. 6)

While I realize (seprmous difficulty in giving us instructions, I

DIR 85653 - ODENVY says their follow-Up LavestigatiOn BI OSWALD's aotivities has produced

"reliable indications" that he was in New Orleans on 19 Sept 63. This, coupled with

earlier evidence that he was in New Orleans applying for unemployment insurance on 17 Sept

means OSWALD would have had to fly to Mext and back between 17 and 19 Sept in order to be

at Cub Emb getting his pay off, as ALVARADO claims, on 18 Sept. With this added info,

believe Mexi can confidently regard ALVARADO as fabriotor and tailor Interrogation

We find it incredible that the Cubans would

brief and pay an assassin in front of ta Nio Interloper. We think it possible or even

Ilkely that he has been in and out of Cub Imb as a Nio agent trying to infiltrate cuba

OSWALD wore glasses. / The fact that ALVARADO 18 & calm, ice and latelligent young man

does not mean he is not fabricator. FYl we and other agencies are being flooded by

Imbricutions on the OSWALD case from several eatinents son originating with people on the

fringes of the intelligence business.

Such fabrications are not unually done for money,

but out el sickly fancy and a desire to get into the intel game. I We do not think it a

remarkable coinoidence that both DORTICOS and ALVARADO talk about money peld to OSWALD.

For one thing, pey for an assassin 1e a laotor walch immediately rises in the mind of

expert and laymen alike. Secondly, DORYICOS may have heard through some Russian of Cuber

source in the Next goverament that DURAN was asked whether the Cubans paid OSWALD for the

alleged assignment. / While we do not insist that ALVARADO's story la beyond all beltef

ve do urge that lexi place it and ALVARADO under the most searching scrutiny.

which may have led him to i make this possible mis-step. In securing confessions of

h fabrication, a sympethetle attitude, stressing awareness of the severe mental strain

the subjeot must be under, and with generous recognition of his

Apparently they did react spontaneously, but then you could look at Mexi's vote,

in the U.N. on the OAS, on Venezuela-Cuban deal and you can see that 1t didn't make a lot

of difference.

No, not on international front. John does not think It would make any

MEMO to COS from JKBENADUM (source): Source has been told to drop everything else and concentrate

on Betty MORA to endeavor to find out any additional info which she might have re OSWALD and

his activities on behalf of the Fair Play For Cuba Committee in New Orleans, La, prior to

the assassination.

(See para 264 above) In this connection it will be recalled that MORA

Stated after the death of the President that she hoped that the FBI would not look too hard

In New Orleans because it could be very bad"for us".

• / Source also reported that Reva BERNSTEIN,

former Chairman of the FPFCC in Detroit, Mich,, has been in Next for more than a month, that

she had been in Puerto Vallarta for a month, that she had wanted to go to Playa Azul but

that she did not do so because "it was not good to do so - so soon after the assassination",

that she was leaving Mexi to go to Zijuatene jo.

Source does not believe she was

in Puerto

Vallarta, nor that she is presently In Zijuatenejo. / BERSIEIN also told source that she had

been questioned in Detroit, prior to her departure Ior Mexi, by the RCMP, but that no inquiry

had been made of her by the FBI or any U.S. police or investigative agency.

The interroga-

tion had to do with the FPFCC, Its activities in the Detroit area, and the fact that she had

reportedly acted as a mail drop for Canadian communists.

This interrogation took place in

the office of her lawyer in Detroit.

at Hotel del Comercio at between 1000 and 1100; OSWALD's room No. 18 was 16.00 pesos daily

with bath, that the registry book indicates OSWALD stayed at hotel night of 1-2 Oct and

departed during the day of 2 Oct 63.

GARCIA Luna could not recall circumstances of OSWALD's

departure nor the hour.

He believed OSWALD neither spoke nor understood any Spanish. He

had not observed OSWALD in the hotel during the day and he was never accompanied by any

He recalled that OSWALD carried a medium-size, brown handbag, which had a zipper

and was either of Naugabyde or canvas material. He did not remember that OSWALD had ever

worn a coat and believed he usually appeared in a short-sleeved shirt of a knit variety.

Matilde GARNICA, maid at the hotel del Comercio, recognized photo of OSWALD as being the

young American who had occupied room No. 18 for almost a week during the latter part of

last year.

She arrives at work between 0900 and 1000 end leaves at 2100. Clearly recalla

OSWALD, as few Americans stay at the hotel. He had few personal effects, carried in a

"small, brown, zippered handbag" canvas or Imitation leather material.

She had seen OSWALD

the day of his arrival and the following Saturday ias he n still was in his room when she

checked to determine

which rooms were available for cleaning.

When she saw him in the room

on Saturday he said "good morning" in English, and a short time later left the hotel.

".....Upon arrival In Sou Union, SHALD voluntarily became associated

KGB arranged press conferences to publicize OSWALD's defection, then provided a job for him

In the sheet metal shop of a radio factory in Minsk.

OSWALD was not a skilled sheet metal

worker. His job was a clerical job of "checker"".

This was a sham cover job.

OSWALD was

given a 5,000 ruble lump sum payment prior to going to Minsk.

Thereafter, he received 700

rubles per month as wages and an additional 700 rubles per month from the KGB.

The 700

ruble payment from the KGB was falsely represented as emnating frim the Sov Red Cross.

The 1,400 ruble monthly Income of OSWALD was compatable to salary of ten mgr of the factory

where he worked.

KGB provided OSWALD with a scarce

and comparatively luxurious apartment

In Minsk for a period of more than two years.

the period she now finde out that OSWALD was here in Mexi prior to the assassination. She

was invited by a Next secretary in the Cub Emb whose husband 1s a cousin of the GARRO

family (Horacio DURANI???). At the party, she saw three Gringos, not drinking, not mixing,

and more or less just standing around together like "three bumps on a log". They were so

obviously out of place, she asked someone in the Cub Emb about them and was told that "they

were just passing zin through". She claims that on account of the way these three gringos

stood out she took & good long look at them as did her daughter. i When assassination occurred

and OSWALD's picture was spread into the newspapers, both Elena and ber daughter Immediately

said that he was one of the three gringos "without a doubt" at the party.

covering; above memo to GOS:

Do you want me to send the gist of this to Has? COS Wrote:

Yes, but we should follow up first. Flannery then wrote:

Nothing further.

DIR 56876 (Ref: MEXI 1191 - para 397 above) Iqs has no evidence that Sovs have advance copy

of photo.

Comn sources assure us its copy of photo furnished by the FBI has also been

altered to black out the background.

At present the annex is scheduled for release around

mid Hov. / Considered opinion here is that Sov action per ref would seem to be a logical CI

step as a precautionary measure on basis of published comm report. That a thorough

security survey should be done at this time either on Sov Emb's own Initiative or on request

from Moscow is not at all surprising, independently of any specifice contained in Comm report.

of & CSCI to the FBI reporting an Incident which might be connected with the assassination..

(attachment is para 409 below)

MEMO TO FBI from WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll info he

allegedly received fron a well known Cuban soientist and acquaintance on 23 Noy 63, but which

he had forgotten to report. The release of the Warren Comn Report reminded him of the inci-

dent. / The solentist said he had been at the Havana airport on afternoon of 22 Nov 63 shen

at 1700 hrs an aircraft with Mexi markings landed and parked at far side of the field.

Two men, whom he recognized as Cuban & "gangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance of

administration bldg and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures.

His

curiosity was aroused, and he was able to leain that the aircraft had just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, via Iijuana and Mex1 City. The plane had been forced to land at Tijuana due

to ongine trouble. By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved In assassination.

He speculated that OSWALD had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

In Dallas to organize or oversee the operation. He told the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he had seen and heard and had to telll someone about it.

He then cautioned

source not to tell anyone else about it or they would hu both be shot by the Cubans. /

The source has passed away since furninhing above info, thus making any follow-up on this

matter impossible.

On 25 Dec Elena discussed her alleged encounter with OSWALD. Also, present ware

Thomas' wife, and Elena's daughter, Flenita.

Further Info was given subsequently on 9 Jan 66.

During this latter conversation, Elena admitted she had gone to AmEmb on an earlier occasion

with her daughter and mother-in-law and talked to two Emb officers (presumably from LEGAT) about

this matter.

She said since the Emb officers did not give much credence to anything they said,

they did not bother to give a very complete story. The following info supplements and in

some instances corrects that given in the memo of Dec 10. / 1.

Lydia, Horacio, and Ruben

DURAN are all cousins of Elena.

Silvia 1s married to Foracio, & weak man, who was converted

to Communism by Ricardo GUERRA.

Elena has nothing to do with Silvia whom she detests and

Ruben was born in U.S. and served in U.S. army during war.

.. Party was

held at home of Ruben.. / Elena belleves date of party was 2 or 3 Sept 63, few days before

vielt of Sov astronaut, Gagarin, but is not sure of date.../ At the party OSWALD wore a black

sweater. He tended to be silent and stared at the floor.

Two young American companions,

one was very tall and slender and had long blond hair idt which hung across forehead, gaunt

face and long protruding chin; other was tald, short light brown hair...All three were

obviously Americans and did not mix or dance with other people: The three were friends,

because Elena saw them by chance the next day walking down the street together. / Although

Elena had returned from Europe In June or July, she had already met Eusebio AZCUE and knows:

positively he was at party.

On another occasion (not clear whether before or after the party

In question), she attended a party where she saw Eusebio AZCUE; Emilio CARBALLIDO; and a Latin

American negro man with red hair.

(These last 2 were not at the DURAN party as was stated

in the 10 Dec memo.)

CARBALLIDO and AZCUE, with others, were in heated discussion on that

occasion about Kennedy and they

came to conclusion that the only

solution was to kill him.

Elena said CARBALLIDO is known as & Castro agent; he had been to Red China, Sov Union, and

many times to Cube.

Memo of Conversation - Subject:

Further on OSWALD and K Assassination - (Ref:

this Subj of 25 Dec 65 - para 427 above) Participants - Elena and Thomas (Pol Offloer)

Elena described some developments which may have some bearing on her claim that she saw

at home of her cousin

Ruben DURAN when OSWALD was in Mexico prior to

assassination.

OSWALD at a part flene said Carlos SOLORZANO 1s well acquainted with Cub Amb MERNANDEZ

Armas, and that he was not leftist but his brother, Alfonso, was a Communist.

Amb HERANDEZ,

told SOLORIANO he wanted to meet Elena, 80 SOLORZANO arranged a party at his

own home on

30 June 66 and Invited both of them.

Also present were Tito MONIEROSO and his wife;

Elvira VARGAS, leftist journalist with NOVEDADES and personal friend of Pres DIAZ Ordaz;

Emanuel CARBALLO, the pro-Castro writer; Joaquin DIAZ Canedo, head of publishing firm

called Editorial Mortiz; and Juan SORIANO, painter, who was invited to make her feel at

ease, since he is a friend of here and was the only anti-Communist there besides herself.

/ During evening, Amb HERNANDEZ, whom she described as intelligent and cultured, concen-

trated his attention on her..... and expressed interest in her friend, Carlos MADRAZO.

He issued a personal invitation to her to attend the annual literary festival of the Casa

de las Americas In Invana. She said she was not a Fidelista and would not go unless

Juan SORIANO went with her. Amb HERNANDEZ then Invited SORIANO but the latter denounced

the Castro rogime over the objections of the others present...../ Later, her friend.

Victor RICO Galan who personally dislikes Amb HERNANDEZ warned her not to go to Cuba alone.

/ On 4 July 66 a driver from the Cub Emb delivered to her home on Calle Alencastre In

Lomas Virreyes an envelope containing two letters and some printed matter from the Casa

de las Amoricas in Havana.

The first letter, written last October (66?) gave her address

as Vermont 38 and the second letter, written in April, gave her address as Vermont 39.

The envelope for the first letter, with the above address, was marked for return to the

sender, which was the Cub Emb here.

The second envelope, which contained the whole pkg,

had no address as it was hand carried to her home - see attachments. / Elena stated the

only reason the letters were addressed to her at Calle Vermont was because she spent several

days at the Hotel Vermont after the assassination.

The correct address of the hotel is

Vermont 29, so she concluded the Cub Gov carried that street and number, with a minor

error, as her regular address. / Since CALVILLO had taken her to the hotel ostensibly to

protect her from the Communists, this raised the question of how the Cubans obtained that g2,

....Eleana said CALVILLO was a close personal friend of Noe

placed outside her home when she returned from the Hotel Vermonth....../ Elena thought it

possible that the Cub Emb had deliberately given her the letters from the Casa de Ins

Americas with the Vermont Street address in order to frighten her.

She was already con-

cerned about what appeared to be three gunshots

that had been fired through her upstairs

window while she was out of the house three weeks ago.

recently encountered her cousin, Lydia Il DURAN and that the latter had been very friendly

and wanted to meet her again.

for tickets. / According to Mr. LOZANO, & reservation is recorded by assigning a seat

numberas available and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination

of the Individual requesting the reservations.

That reservation is respected under normal

conditions until two hours before departure time; however, In the event

all seats are not

filled, it may be held until the actual departure of the bus.

Prior to the departure of

the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that

particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communioates by radio to the

company

headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus in relation to the

Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tiokets.

/ Francisco ALVARADO,

ticket salesman and dispatcher for Transportes Frontera, advised

that he prepared most of

the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name "OSWLD" and destination "Lared"

appear opposite Seat No. 4.

He stated that he did not write the "OSWLD" reservation info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and the info recorded by the

baggage handler, Lucio LOPEL. ALVARADO is quite certain at the present time that the

Individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchase a ticket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest.

No ticket number was recorded for that person, and

a search of the company's records in Monterrey had failed to locate a ticket stub which

was not otherwise accounted for in connection with that particular trip. I The notations

by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, Y Monterrey" reflected that he had reported by radio to the

Monterryy office of the company that the bus had departed with nine "paying" passengers

for Laredo and seven "paying" passengers destined for Monterrey.

Listed under "Name of

Passengers" were "OSWLD" with no ticket number, indicating he did not travel; "Angel PEREZ"

with no ticket number or destingtion, which confirmed that he had not purchased a ticket

and had not boarded the bus; and

"Nicolas GONZALEZ" Seat No. 10, listed as having traveled

on a pass to Torreon. /.../ ALVARADO and Gilberto LOZANO stated that the notations on

the back of the manifest referred to advances of funds made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the

cash for repairs, parts or other requirements.

They related that the passenger lists

are not kept as a permanent record, and, when the manifest was looted in the

"trash"

at the request of investigators of the Mexi Presidential Staff, the Blanks at the tope

of the form had not been filled in as to time, destination, trip number, bus number, and

date, but they had completed those blanks from their personal knowledge in order to make

that data clear to the investigators. They also had listed the names of the drivers on the

formax at that time. They affirmed that the handwritten "Transportes Frontere" at the top

of the document had been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document

was borrowed from them. / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection of

OSWALD, etc.... they could offer no explanation as to how Mexican authorities had arrived

at the conclusion that OSWALD had travelled on the Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Oct 63,

but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had not been given

an opportunity of reviewing, analyzing or checking out the data

thereon. / Lucio LOPEZ

Medina, baggage and freight handler at Transportes, related that he often assists the

ticket salesman by recording reservations and is quite certain that he wrote the "OSWLD"

and "LARED" opposite Seat No. 4 on the passenger manifest of 2 Oct 63. He stated that he

also had recorded the reservations and ticket sales to "ECO. SAUCEDO"
