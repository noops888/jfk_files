on the best types of cameras, films, -and concealment devices. These

: and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta~
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
“graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of —

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re- :
cruited agent: who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in. the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six. recruited agents
which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral mail i operation,

Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction
of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. Their agents were beds, and corrupt. \

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there .
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated
equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-
ficulties.
