1. WIROGUE has- received poritical recognition from the west German

This was accomplished. with the Cooperation of ODIBEX-on the basis of the

‘All’the South American Consulates in West .Germany were contacted |

@Ssistance ‘of CANANTILLA in an attempt to collect information ~
which would. enable HARVARD to select the most likely country. to. which
Subject gould. immigrate based-on his personal preference, opportunities fo:
emigrants, immigration requirements, etc, Columbia, Chile or Peru offer
the best possibility, = :

3. The next step will be for subject to apply to the appropriate

Consulate and begin his Processing. Prior to having Subject take this

Step HARVARD will ‘require Headquarters guidance and thinking regarding the
following: 4

a+ Subject as a prospective emigrant will’have to ‘furnish proof
Wace Bloyment or proof of finanesat Solvency, Subject 's
mest German documentation indicates fhat he is an engineer,
‘This does not mean that he ig diplomaed engincer but rather
falas pe gnechanic. . This is borne but by the details of his
falsified life history and in fact by Subject's actual skills
“in electrical and mechanical fields. HARVARD feels that
Subject can satisfy any South American Consulate that he ig
Gen venced enough in electrical and mechanical fields to be
of value to the economy of the South American country of his
nhgice. “Once Subject is admitted te South America, HARVARD
has no doubt that he can find employment if he desires it.
“The idéal solution, however, would be for Subject to have a
firm offer of employment prior to his immigration. If KURARK
soura range this, HARVARD feels that Subject 's immigration
could be practically ‘assured> Subject could seek employment
papoush the German language ackSPaper in Santiago, Chile but
HARVARD feels that no South American firm would take the
chance of hiring him Sight unseen unless he were’ a highly

qualified specialist,

be If proof of employment cannot be provided, proof of solvency
is the next requirement. Only one of the’south American
countries has statec what it considers to be the minimum proof
of solvency. The prospective emigrant must show that he has
the funds to subsist for two Moana tt the rate of. $125.00 per
month. HARVARD feels that ‘to deposit $3,000 to Subject 's
Sunount Would be a grave mistake. HARVARD-has—ro; hat

_ CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

C. HARVARD has not considered Processing Subject for immigration
through a bona fide ve fugee organizatlfon-in-order. not -to involve Subject
with the United States Escapee Program and to keep from making~ refigee

Organization’a party to fraud with the possibility of embarrassing com=
|Plications if the immigration docs not, come off properly. Working
through a refugee organization-would mean additional paper work and
Additional problems which “os the preseat would indicate that this
immigration avenue should not’ be considered except as a last resort,

d. When ‘filling out nis application: forms Subject will have to-
provide employment and ‘residence addresses consistent with the dates ‘when
he was Supposedly living and working in the Georgian S.S.R.. His wartime
military servicé will have. to be covered also. HARVARD feels that this
information can be acquired through the facilities of SR/6 when needed.

4 “HARVARD is of the opinion that Subject has committed himself to
going to-South America partly because he Will do anything which will, pro-
long his association with KUBARK and Partly because he is hoping to.
realize some personal or financial profit from the exercise. HARVARD has
followed the theme “that.-Headquarters ‘deisré is to help Subject and that i¢|
‘pean best be done -by- completely legalizing him. Political recognition is
the-first step but'we desire further that ‘he ‘be helped ‘to immigrate and-.
after 5. years acquire citizenship... Subject has asked HARVARD if he would
receive financial ‘help during ‘the transition Period. in South America. ‘He
was told that’we could ‘only guarantee iis plane fare, that Headquarters |
would decide .how much and what kind of additional help he would receive

jif any.
5. Subject rejects the idea of staying in Germany except as a last

resort. It is pussible that because of his irritation with his inactivity,
Subject may simply request his German documentation and leave HARVARD's

been costing us 100 to 150 DM per week, plus many hours of case officer
time, Request earliest Headquarters advice per para 3 above,

child-during tile lycee education in France ani was frequontly cisalssed by
gchool"tirectors who did not apprectate Mis’ texperamental performance. 3e
also. attended ‘several engineoring ‘colleges tut apparently never graduated.

In 1939, he volunteered for the French Foreisa Legion and was sent to. Tunisia.
The occupation of France in 1941 ended his military career. He was demobilized
amd returnéd to Paris. :

2. Subject claimed that he wanted to fight for France,’ but he did not

‘sh to’ join a. collectivo-resistance organization. - He decided to act ‘on his
gm so he joinéd a labor force being recruited in Paris to go to Germangy.
- For awhile he worked in a synthetic gasoline slant.in Soclitz near Berlin,
Later he was employed as a:driver for the “SEX. During this tine, he began
‘nis carcor in blacks marketing and docunent forging. ig clained that he forged
. Faszes into and out of Germany and did it te help imprisoned French officers
~ to et back to France. It is felt that the ulterior motives might still have
deen love of excitement and wish to make noney, ite also claized that he did
not work for the French Resistance, althoucs it was possible and probably
that they gave hin orders to fill. He did nention working through internediaries
and cut-outs, so its possible that ho did actually work with the Resistance out
did not want to tell us. Eventually Subject was arrested by the Cernan regular
police for his activities, and later brought to Berlin where he was interrogated
for several sonths at Cestapo lieadquarters. =o ended up by spending time in
Jailsand concentration camps. He was finally Lberated by the U.S. Army.

. 3. After the’ thrill and axcitemont of the war years was passed, Subject
|_ contd rot settle down to = routine existence. So ho joined up with an
acquaintance vho he says convinced ain of the necessity to make sore money.
They decided to commit robberies, One was successful. Unfortunately fer
Subject, the other was not. IMs friend was apcrehended and confessed, Subject

spent the next five years in various rather ~torious prisons in France.

MEMORANDUM FOR: |, AF/S

SUBJECT : 1. Informal Character Assessment of WIROGUE
7 During the Period July59-Nov 1960
2. ‘Suggested Considerations for WIROGUE Resettlement
, Phase
_ 3.) Damage Report Contribution

1, - The following observations and. comments ‘are intended to
represent an- informal personality assessment and factors in’consid-
eration of resettlement for AESPIC, now WIROGUE.. It is based on a
period of-training and handling prior to: anticipated dispatch--early
Julystthrough late November.1960. These thoughts are based on
personal daily extended contact as traincr/agent handler with Subject
as a member of prospective cross-border team for implementation of
REDSOX Operation. AESENTINEL. One member was re-assessed operationally
unsuitable; which left a team of 2 agents, both of which Undersigned
continued to handle.. It is:hoped that this assessment may be of
some benefit to the AF Desk Officer, who requested it the day of this
writing. It is intended that Subject's demonstrated suitability for
AESENTINEL, an infiltration-exfiltration operation into difficult’.
terrain in the Soviet Union, will serve as a mechanism rather than
an end in illustrating Subject's general abilities and limitations
for the task at hand. An attempt has been made to present this
material in subject categories considered operationally meaningful.
Quoted passages in Part I are Subjects own or the closest approx-
imation memory permits.

2. It is my considered opinion that the SubjectVof this writing

has the highest personal and professional regard for Undersigned. I
do also consider that, although thoughtful handling and sclf assured-
hess were prepequisite agent control factors during this case, Subject
did not causévan Uncomfortable amount of special handling problems.
The s¢nior Project Officer was Mr. Perry Crookham, C/DOD/DOB during

the training and holding prior-to-dispatch phase of the operation.

3. Subject Background and Chronological Association Factors
Deened Operationally Significant

A, Subject is.an approximately 49 year old cithnic Georgian
fluent in Georgian, French, German and English, Subject emigrated to
France with the remains of his family during the pre-Lycée stage of
his life. His father, a TBILISI University academician and intellect-
ual of some note , elected-to stay in Sovict Georgia, during which
period Sovict dominance in the.West Caucasus was fairly well

ified. Subject considers that his fathersdecision was made of



“. ‘recognition. in-imitation of his father.

his own free will \ut which nevertheless disappointed Subject greatly,
as he greatly admired him, despite the fact that Sudject's’ fathers
decision was responsible for the suicide of his mother, whom Subject
greatly loved. Undersigned believes that Subject anguish in
memories of his parents was genuine, Subject was a clever though.
precocious child during his Lycée education, and frequently was
dismissed by ‘school directors who did not: appreciate his temperamental
though erratically brilliant performance. Subject,during this stage
‘development, probably tricd as hard as ever in his life to conform
to the rules of society, which during that stage of French national
education practices, would probably scem quite strict by American
middle-school practices. Subject greatly desired academic/professional
These feelings were especially
frustrating hecause of his quick mind and. seeming natural ability for
mechanical and electrical theory and principals. I do not believe he-
ever has learned to consider’conventions of living anything more than
a tiresome game to be played when there is no alternative. Subject's
quick mind, and! early appreciation, recognition and adaptance of
guile did much to ensure the ncessary understanding of French culture
for moderate success in that country. Subject who an unusual
looking man even by French standards, has ho trouble in identifying
with the under-privileged elements of French society. Subject is
tenporally bald, hooked nose, short,’ slender, bandy legged, wiry,
and-of dark complexion but possessed of a dry, caustic wit eager to
‘Laugh and contribute in’ the ucasian spirit of comarderie to those
whom .he considers worthy of friendship, Subject, howsver, makes real
friends cautiously, and has conciously established for himself
personality assessment. criteria that would do justice to many success-
ful senior FI or CE C/O - agent handlers.

B. World War If offered Subject the welcomed opportunity to
ability,agd ingenuity by engaging in black market affairs in
ems andvtravel documents in German-occupied France. Subject
would wistfully recount stories of his escapades during that period,
which, after really getting to know Subject, seemed to te entirely
mossible, Subicct admired the Germans as “worthy anponents",
particularly their efficiency and ability to act dec vely whether the
problem be tactical or strategic, An extended period of German
encarceration (until war's end) did nothing to alter his ‘opinion.

Wars’ end left Subject bored and unfulfilled, The excitement and thrill
of "the game" were gone and Subject's unsettled, numb confusion was

for quite another reason than most of Europes milling thousands of
displaced and ‘shattered families. Therefore, it was not long before
Subject and a close friend from his black market days decided on a
daring daylight bank robbery in one of the: suburban centers of France.
Subject contends he planned the robbery from start to finish, and
needed only someone to help. Subject and his accomplice carefully.
cased a bank, stole a heavy truck and during the height of the business
day backed the truck fuli speed in reverse through the large street
level plate glass window. Subject said he hopped out of the truck with

show hi
luxury



an automatic weapon, while "the people were frozen solid", gathered
up the money and was away quickly. Subject sdid the scheme failed
because his accomplice went to the cache-site to get some of the money
to spend before it was safe to do so. His accomplice was apprehended
and in time broke down and implicated Subject. Subject said he wes
not :bitter at fis betrayer, but rather professé¢d a genuine admiration
for French.interrogation techniques. Subject served a difficult
confinement of 5 yéars, and-was ‘paroled to an older brother in

Marseilles, as I recall.

C..-Subject said that he began at that point to appreciate the
futility of violent actions, While opposing the authority of society.
He therefore attempted to go into business using some of the inventions '
that he had conceived during his confinement in prison, His winning
personality and intense drive .and self-confidence quickly gained him a
business partter with capital to invest in’ a cinematographic color F
reproduction system that was pattened and earned decent profits for the
venture. Subject was still on parole and tied to his older brother
"self-righteous indulgence’, however. It was shortly after this that
Subject was approached by a'member of the AIS who was ‘following up on
Subject as-an-ops lead furnished by a cousin in the US who was a
moderately successful lawyer, and who had beer’ long since recruited as
an ageat Spotter for cithnic Georgians. Subject was favorably assessed
and removed back from France, because of travel restrictions imposed
under his parole status, I believe that this opportunity rekindled
his old feelings of éxhilaration and ateful enthusiasm for the
opportunity to perform his deeds of ding for an authority, sanctioned

by a national state, in this case the AIS.

D. Were at last, he considered, was a secure source of backing
and support, for his natural outlets. Subject always considered the
Agency as sn. Gil business partner, ally, and protector. fe was
therefore a grateful, sincere "tool" who thoroughly enjoyed his role
as lower echelon action agent. Subject wow pristily frels Vine su equst Pre twers

E, Ho was a willing pupil, physically active -- since the job
called for physical endurance -- and looked on self-denial and fatigue
recognition as a point of honor. -Undersigned was never a poor

the

athlete, however, was bested on numerous occasions at whatever
field probéem. Subject absorbed Soviet Realities, order Troops M.0.
and basic tradecraft quickly and with great applicd flexibility.

F. It was during this period that Subject began to confide
regularly and in depth to Undersigned. Subject would often tell
Undersigned, "Fred, you must belicve me, I want to do something."
"Twill do anything you tell me to do, only tell me.” "You (meaning
the Agency) want me to kill somebody. - Okay! I do it anyway you say
T believe Subject was genuinely sincere, and that this was neither an
attempt to impress his C/O or a trust/assurance maneuver.



G.

-When. an indefinite hold was placed on AESENTINEL by

higher. Agency authority, one team member was re-oriented and placed

on conservation in a cover job.

Undersigned ultimately conducted this

“agent back to his Scandinavian home where resettlement.was achieved

ith a minimum of arrangements, however, Subject was transferred to

“SAE. Division for. projected operational.use in-central Africa. This,
if memory serves, was, accomplished in Late 1960.

6. WIROGUE Resettlement Considerations

A. AF/S representative has requested comment from Undersigned
on [NIROGUE's apparent reluctance at resettlement attempts in Frankfurt
a/H which are underweigh at the present time, I believe. It is
undersigned's understanding that (uajeets-2 has threated to work for
the French Service if resettlenent negotiations do not proceed to é
Subject'$ liking. Speculation has been that this is probably a bargain-
ing tactic t6 gouge an appreciable amount of additional dollars in his
resettlement claim. Undersigned considérs this a quite valid
assumption, and entirely attributable to Subject. Subject probably
views this threat as particularly critical in view of the seeming
political/economic confléct with the French, and appeeciates by now
one of the differences between the AIS and the IS of a fascist and/or
totalitarian state,



“internationally tolerated, "Spyi

B. However, Undersigned would like to suggest the following
interpretation fer wh-tever valu be in it. T suggest that money,
per se, is net the primary end that Subject is striving for-now, just
as it never seered to be his pri concern throughout his-life. [
believe that, Subject genuinely enj clandestine operations; at least,
his conception of clandestine operations. Subject probably would,
prefer to work for the ‘AIS or: possibly the W. German Service because
he has a genuine fondness for the people and many aspects of the :
kulture of both countries. The idea of legalized, or at least

offers the opportunity to
» , Subject's seteasedsten that he is

professional”

legitimize, and thereby rational
protecting equity in an important, unique,
category.-

C,-“Subject,. during the period of Undersignedsexposure, always”
considered that..if he had money-fine, if not, then enough would come
his way from.someplace:to sustain him from one venture © the next.
Subject felt that the acquisition of-money would be a by-product of
his opportunist. schemes and technical inventions in pursuance of his
main goal-personal recognition for perscnal achievements and triumphs’.

D. I believe Subject does not expect ‘to be accepted in his
offer of employment with the French.Service, but rather to let our
minds jump to the next logical step-the full meaning of the result
of such an atter3t on his part. Subject knows very well that he has
violated his parole and would be encarcerated on his return. I believe
his pride and the probability of censure and ridicule of family and
friends in France would disuade hin in the final analysis.

E, Subject is a most excellent chess player. [ have never
won from him, nor have I cver seen him lose a game. I consider that
Subject has thought this line of action out thoroughly. It. is
apparent that he is willing to gamble his quit claim settlement on
something that I betieve he has specifically in mind--possibly the
offer of new docurents and identity in some third country. He has
always had a great desire to "surprise" everyone back home (i.e. Paris):
with new docuzents, a new identity, plastic surgery, etc. I do not
believe that what he wants is necessarily more dollars, but rather
for the AIS to once again help htm (as co-partner) to achieve his aim
of acclaim, success and recognition, possibly this time to family and

friends in France.

F, {do net believe that Subject could ever be physically
intimidated. He lost half his front teeth to German interrogators and
the other half to French prison guar Additionally, he docs possess
a defiant spirit that sometimes c through as sheer obstinacy to

friends,

G. If it is considerd worthwhile, I believe an attempt should
be made to lec C/O locally who has handled him in the past. A
C/O for whon ct has respect as a higher echelon and whom he
considers understands him, T suggest that this C/O interview Subject
in an uncontrolled environment to determine what it is that Subject



. the matter at hand.
“Undersigned actively handled Subject.

‘
really wants. -To. bdt of my ‘recollection, Subject thought highly
of Monty Love (T), the C/O that helped pitch him and who brought
him out Black from France. Monty was to'go to one of the German
Stations or bases the last time I saw him in late 1959.

the problen. of WIROGUE which is now being clarified.

ae ‘2. The problem of bickstopping of resettlenent ‘and
disposal’.cases ‘has been carefully reviewed by elements of csB
concerned including CABEPOSE, MKTOPAZ and CATHINE.” In this
connection there is attached a copy of a menorandin dated 27
August ‘1963 from Chief/MKTOPA?-which’ outlines the current
situation. As willbe noted MRTOPA? has and will expand its
capability ‘for procuremeat of operational documeuts independent
of the 513th ICG. It is believed that the present procedures
for backstopping of resettlexent and disposal cases should be
continued. In theory an inderendent Capability is desirable
‘ but not really practical at this time, Creation of an
ef independent capability for backstopping resettleuent cases
bai would require duplication of the procedures and practices now -
folloved by Hr. Sillms of the 5l3ta ICG. In addition, wo would
not nave the advantage of hiding our cases from the Germans among:
other Army disposal cases. Furthernore, USAREUR has requested
notification prior to contact with any German officials of any
Sensitive cases which we may desire to handle without military
assistance~-sce USAREUR letters dated 7 August 19€1 and 25 March
19€2, attached. With considerable effort it would be possible
to backstop some of our resettlenent and disposal cases directly
with German officials, It would be quict difficult, however, to
prevent the Army fron learniag of such action which is contrary
to thé USAREUR request,

: 3. ‘it 1s possible that the FEDREP will enact new

: legislation on the control of non-Gernan refugees. Likewise,
now FEDREP energency laws may affect this type of case. We will
keep this situation under review and in the event the circum,
stances change will.inittate’ appropriate action,
