RE: "43:3" - (CHECK "X" ONE)

MARKED FOR INDEXING

NO INDEXING REQUIREO

INDEXING CAN BE JUDGED.

BY QUALIFIED HQ.

DESK ONLY

REFERENCE(S)

WIROGUE has received

political recognition from the West German

government and is fully

documented in

the name of Georg Frank Sanders.

This was accomplished with the cooperation of ODIBEX on

the basis of

fabricated story

stating that Subject is a Georgian who defected from

East Berlin on 14 July 1962 while with a tourist group. It was necessary

to acquire

political recognition for Subject because this was the only

sure means to backstop him if and when he applies

for immigration to

South America.

A. Fremdenpass would not withstand the investigation

required by immigration authorities.

2. All the South American Consulates in West Germany were contacted

assistance of CAMANTILLA in an

attempt to collect information

which would enable HARVARD to select the most likely country to which

Subject could immigrate based on his personal preference,

opportunities fon

emigrants, immigration requirements, etc. Columbia, Chile or Peru offer

the best possibility.

3, The next step will be for Subject to apply to the appropriate

Consulate and begin his processing.

Prior to having Subject take this

step HARVARD will require Headquarters guidance

and thinking regarding the

following::

a.

Subject as a prospective emigrant will have

to furnish

of employment or proof

of financial solvency.

Subject's

West German documentation indicates that he is an engineer.

This does not mean that he is a diplomaed engineer but rather

a master mechanic. • This is borne out by the details

falsified life history and in fact by Subject's actual skills

in electrical and mechanical fields.

HARVARD feels

Subject can satisfy any South American Consulate that he is

experienced enough in electrical and mechanical fields to be

of value to the economy of the South American country of his

"Once Subject is admitted to South America, HARVARD

has no doubt that he can find employment if he desires it.

-The ideal solution, however:

would be for Subject to have

firm offer of employment prior to his immigration.

can arrange this,

HARVARD feels that Subject's immigration

could be practically assured.

Subject could seek employment

through the German language newspaper in Santiago, Chile but

HARVARD feels that no South American firm would take the

chance of hiring him sight unseen unless he were a highly

qualified specialist.

b.

536

If proof of employment cannot be provided, proof of solvency

is the next requirement.

Only one of the

South American

countries has stated what it considers to be the minimum proof

of solvency:

The prospective emigrant must show that he has

the funds to subsist for two years at the rate of. $125.00 per

HARVARD feels that to deposit S3,000 to Subject's

account would be a grave mistake.

HARVARD Has nordoubt that

Subject is capable of taking the money and departing for parts

unless there vere sufficient inducements awaiting him

HARVARD could probably arrange for a letter

fact that Subject has S3,000 being held|for

Subject could have been working for ODIBEX as a consul-

•CONTRUAiION OF

DISPATCH

SECRET

EGOA - 18888

HARVARD has not considered processing Subject for immigration

through a bona fide

refugee organization in order not to involve Subject

with

the United States

EScapee Program and to keep from making a refügee

organization a party

to-fraud with.the possibility of embarrassing.com

piications

immigration does not come

off properly.

through a refugee organization would mean additional paper work

additional

fe: the present wolid indicate

immigration avenue should not be considered except as a last resort.

When filling out his application forms Subject will have to

provide employment and residence

addresses consistent with the dates when

he was supposedly living and working in the Georgian S.S.R. His wartime

service will have to be covered also.

HARVARD feels that this

information can be acquired through the facilities of SR/6 when needed.

HARVARD is of the opinion that Subject has committed himself to

going tọ South Arerica partly because he will do anything which will pro-

long his association with KUBARK and partly because he is hoping

realize some personal or financial profit from the exercise.

HARVARD has

followed the theme that Headquarters deisre is to help Subject and that it

can best be

done by. completely legalizing him.

Political recognition is

the first step but we desire further that he 'be helped to immigrate and.

after 5 years acquire citizenship.... Subject has asked HARVARD if he would

receive financial help during the transition period in South America.

was told that we could only guarantee his plane

fare, that Headquarters

would decide how much and what kind of additional help he would receive

Subject rejects the idea of staying in Germany except as a last

possible that because of his irritation with his

inactivity

Subject may simply request his German documentation and leave HARVARD'S

custody.

Subject has been in HARVARD's hands since 22 May 1962 and has

been costing us 100 to 150 DM

per week, plus many hours of case officer

Subject Background and Chronological Association Factors

Dcemed Operationally Significant

Subject is an approximatcly 49 ycar old eithnic Georgian

in Georgian, French, German and English.

Subject emigrated to

with the remains of his family during the pre-Lycee

father, a TBILISI University academician and intellect-

ual of some note

during which

period Soviet dominance

in the Nest Caucasus was fairly well

solidified.

as he greatly admired him,

desnite the fact

that Subject's fathers

decision was responsible for the suicide of his mother, whom

Subject

greatly loved.

Undersigned believes that Subject's anguish in

memories of his parçnts has genuine.

Subject was a clever though

precocious child during his Lycee education, and freglently was

dismissed by school directors who did

not appreciate his temperamental

though erratically brilliant performance.

Subject, during this stage

of derelopment

education practices, would probably seem quite strict bi American

These feelings were especially

mechanical and electrical theory and principals.

I do not believe he

ever has learned to consider conventions of living anything more than

a tiresome game to be played when there is no alternátive..

Subject's

quick mind, and early appreciation, recognition and adaptance of

guile did much to ensure the riessary understanding of French culture:

for moderate success in that country.

Subject who is an unusual

Subicet aumired the Germans as "worthy apponents"

particularly their efficiency and ability to act decisively whethor the

problem be tactical or strategic.

An extended period of German

encarceration (until war's end) did nothing to alter his opinion.

The excitement and thrill

displaced and shattered families.

Therefore,

it lias not long before

Subject said the scheme

6. WIROGUE Resettlement Considerations

AF/5 representative has requested comment from Undersigned

on NIROGUE'S

apparent reluctance at resettlement attempts in Frankfurt

/M which

are underweigh at the present time,

I believe.

indersigned's understanding that Subjected has threated to work for

the French Service if resettlement negotiations do not proceed to

Subject's liking. Speculation has been that this is probably a bargain-

ing

tactic to gouge an appreciable amount of additional dollars in his

resettlement claim.

Undersigned considers this a quite valid

assumption, and entirely attributable to Subject.

Subject probably

views this

threat as particularly critical in view of the seeming

and appreciates by now

political/econonic conflict with the frand the is of a fascist and/or

one of the differences between the AIS

totalitarian state.

WIROGUE, former REDSOX agent candidate and African Division

agent has been quitclaimed and resettled on

the local economy.

This dispatch summarizes the WIROGUE case from May 1962 to March

1964.

2.

Subject arrived in Frankfurt/Main from the Congo on 22 May

1962. KUBARK's reasons for establishing contact were

dictated by

the need to relieve Subject of his KUBARK-supplied false Austrian

passport, the need to institute or suggest a

member of society and, above all, prevent his return to the Congo.

Since adequate documentation was

a primary consideration for

successful resettlement, Subject was briefed on the relative merits

The WIROGUE case suffered a temporary setback when in December

1962 the BUNDESVERFASSUNGSSCHUTZ (BFV),

the West German organization

responsible for the internal security of the FEDREP became interested

in Subject and requested all available information.

HARVARD briefed

OCA Bonn that Subject was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case

CONTINUATION OF

DISPATCH

S-E-C-R-E-T

EGO.3-21573

By summer 1963 dutailed South American

immigration data

This disclosed that Subject's language

deficiencies, background, knowledge of the Soviet Union, and work

history were insufficient to guarantee his smooth processing

through

the INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE FOR EUROPES MIGRATION

(ICEM) Our investigation also pointed up the fact that until

Subject was provided with a detailed life history containing the

infornation required by prospective employers and/or immigration

he was not

in a position to be resettled anywhere,

let alone South America.

As a result, HARVARD's plans

to process

• Subject for immigration

had to be cancelled, at least temporarily.

7.. A CABEZONE Stage I C.O, was given

the task of preparing a

life

story containing the factual information needed for the filling

out of job applications, to stand

up under detailed interviews and,

if South American inmigration ever took

place, to satisfy immigration

requirements.

This legend was given to ODIBEX Camp King representa-

tives who prepared a new political recognition

arranged for the removal of copies of the old story from the various

FEDREP files and replaced them with the new.

For the first time since Subject had arrived in HARVARD'S

custody the way was clear for a final resettlement.

Subject's

Reiseauswels was renewed

and he was quitclaimed and advised to

work and establish himself in Germany.

He was told that nothing

more could be done for him and that immigration to South America

at anytime in the future would be without KUBARK assistance.

9.

HARVARD has done everything to insure Subject a successful

future :free

problems resulting from his

"black" association

with KUBARK.

Therefore, there is good reason to believe that

become involved with any of Subject's

future problems.

It is also unlikely he will attempt to coerce

KUBARK with threats to reveal all.

With his criminal background

he is aware that he can be brought to the attention of the French

authorities.

He also believes that KUBARK's position in the FEDREP

is such that

we have nothing to fear from any action on his part.

At the time of this writing Subject has a position as

research

and development engineer with a Munich firm.

Ile allegedly

receives DM 1500 per month, has an expense account and is to receive

a percentage of all profits reulized from the sale of any devices

he develops.

to move to Munich permanently about the

end of May or June 1964:

HARVARD has arranged

with CSB Data Processing Branch to

publish a noforn drop notice under Subject's documented name so

that any attempt to immigrate to any country will bring him to the

attention of KUBAFK and appropriate action can be taken.

12.

It is suggested that Headquarters arrange to apprise

HARVARD of any

inquiries

regarding

Subject under lis documented

name or any of the names listed in

the problem of WIROGUE which is now being clarified.

References represent an initial misunderstanding of /

The problen of bachstopping of resettlement. and

disposal cases his been carefully reviewed by elements of CSB

concerned including CABEZONE; UKTOPAZ. and CATTINS. In this

St can

connection there is attacked a copy of a monorandia dated 27

August 1963 from Chief/UKTOPAZ which outlines the current

sltuation.

As will be noted UKTOPAZ has and will expand its

capability for procurement of operationnl docurents independent

of the

513th ICG.

It is believed that the present procedures

for backstopping of resettlezent and disposal cases should be

continued.

In theory an independent capability is desirable

but not really practical at this tine:

Creation of an

Independent capability for backstopping resettlement cases

would require duplication of the procedures and practices now

follored by lit. Fillny of

the Sl3tu ICG.

In addition, we would

not have the advantage of hiding our cases from the Germans among

other Army disposal cases:

Furthernore, USAREUR has requested

notification prior to contact with any German officials

of any

sensitive cases which we may desire to handle without military

assistance--see ESARFUR letters dated 7 August 19€1 and 23 March

1902, attached.

"ith considerable effort it would be possible

to backstop some of our resettlenent and disposal cases directly

with German officials.

It would be quiet difficult,

horever, to

prevent the Army fron learning of such action which

is contrary

to the USAREUR request.

It is possible that the FEDREP will enact new

legislation on the control of non-Gernan refugees.

Likewise,

neY FEDRED energency laws may affect this type of case.

We vill

keep this situation under revieg and in the event the circun-

stances change will inittate appropriate action.

Subject continues to study English

while his processing for immigration

He will give up his

job

in Ruesselsheim early next month

and return to Frankfurt.

Subject's processing for immigratiön

to the U.S. under the Parolee Act

has been deferred until December 1963.

Due to a change in the right lung,

discovered while comparing recent and

earlier x-rays, the U.S.P.H.S. has

requested the

deferment until

sputum

tests and future x-rays

indicate the

condition stabilized or eliminated.

Arrangements are being made through

ODIBEX for Subject to receive FEDREP

political recognition. CAMANTILLA

will then assist in finding a job

and housing on the local economy.

In the meantime Subiect is taking

German language lessons.

IDEN-271

Subject's life story has been

prepared with appropriate changes

regarding his defection in Ireland.

The story will be presented to FEDREP

DS-964

DS-981

DS-999

HARVARD has learned through

CIMANTILLA that Subject and wife

have returned to the U.S. where

both have found employment and are

now apartment hunting.

At Subject's request HARVARD made

arrangements to obtain a duplicate

of the deregistration form

covering

Subject's move from Frankfurt to

Neuss in July 1962.

Subject and family are being assisted

in obtaining West German citizenship.

DS-127

Subject's Communist Party membership

was

discussed informally but at some

length with the local ODURGE chief..

Since the latter believed that Subject's

membership would, according to the strict

interpretation of the law, be ruled

voluntary, processing for immigration to

the U.S.

under Public Law 110 has been

requested:

Resettled during the reporting period.

Subject will not appear

on next month's or subsequent HARVARD reports unless and until

some new unforeseen aspect of the case arises requiring additional

HARVARD action.

In this event the case will be listed and the new

action described under Category I C.

Subject has begun to look for an apart-

ment on the local economy. In the mean-

time he will continue to occupy HARVARD

WIROGUE

Subject's legend is being rewritten

and when finished will provide the

• basis for a more plausible political

recognition story.

HARVARD hopes that

with the substitution of the new story

for the old, positive steps can be taken

for Subiect's resettlement.

IDEN-264

The morale problem created by the slow

moving quota under which Subject is

registered for U.S, immigration has

required HARVARD to register her for

immigration under the Parolee Act.

It.

is expected that Subject will receive

her visa.in August or September but the

Parolee Act will be used in the event the

quota continues to remain unchanged.
