Comments on Manuscript Give Us This Day;
CIA and the Bay of Pigs Invasion by Edward J.
Hamilton

This ‘manuecript has evidently been kicking around in publishing
circles since at least mid-1968, presumably without CIA clearance.
William Buckley of the National Review seems to have been “shopping” it
at one point. One publisher rejected it as too "controversial", and noted
its.” confidential" nature as well as its potential for libel suits.

2, In the foreword to thie manuscript, the author (whom I shall
to. under his assumed name of Hamilton), describes the book as a
Becount" of CIA's role in the Bay of Pigs affair in which he was
nfor- CIA participant for 19 months, He notes in the foreword his hope
that someone would have written this book so that he would not have to do
it; now convinced that, if he does not write it, it will never be written,
he has taken up his pen “yeluctantly and in a mood of nostalgic bitterness."
states that he has used no official files or documente and has
id no one in preparing this work, Where true names are used in
Snanuscript for CIA personnel, he writes that they have been publicly
ied before, and in this contention I believe that he is correct, with
‘possible exception 7 | The author's claim that this book
would provide no information not known to Castro's intelligence service,
or that details this late are of no value to the opposition,is, in my view,
seriously open to question.

3. The book is, in general,favorable to CIA actions in the Bay of
The villains of the piece are certain liberal figures in the Kennedy
inistration (Schlesinger, Goodwin, Stevenson) and to some extent,

disguised againet those in the Administration and the press who took
the opportunity of the Bay had Pigs incident to attack and denigrate CIA.

4. Mesers.:Bissell‘and Barnes and the author's other CIA co-

workers inthe Cuban Project, by and large, are given quite favorable

treatment. One exception is General Cabell, whom the author excoriates,
