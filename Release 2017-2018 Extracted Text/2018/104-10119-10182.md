Comments on Manuscript Give Us This Day:

CIA and the Bay of Pigs Invasion by Edward J.

Hamilton

1o.

This manuecript has evidently been kicking around in publishing

circles since at least mid-1968, presumably without CIA clearance.

William Buckley of the National Review weems to have been "shopping" it

at one point. One publisher rejected il as too "controversial", and noted

Its "confidential" nature no well as its potential for libel suite.

Z. In the foreword to this manuscript, the author (whom I shall

for to under his assumed name of Hamilton), describer the book as a

"Personal mccount" of CIA's role in the Bay of Pigs affair in which be was

esentor CIA participant for 19 months. He notes in the foreword his hope

that someone would have written this book so that he would not have to do

it; now convinced that, if he does not write di, it will never be written,

he has taken up his pen "reluctantly and in a mood of nostalgic bitterness."

•Hamilton states that be has used no official files or documente and has :

Consulted no one in preparing this work. Where true names are used in

the manuscript for CIA personnel, he writes that they have been publicly

Idontified before, and in this contention I believe that he is correct, with

the possible exception of

I The author's claim that this book

would provide no information not known to Castro's intelligence service,

or that details thie late are of so value to the opposition, is, in my view.

seriously open to questios.

ministration (Schlesinger, Goodwin, Stevenson) and to some extent,

the opportunity of the Bay of Pigo Incident to attack and denigrate CIA.

workere in the Cuban Project, by and large, are given quite favorable

treatment. One exception is General Cabell, whom the author excoriates,
