Informal Comments on HSCA Drafts

1. Below is a listing of the comments that we submitted to the HSCA on the

draft

reports. As you will recall, the agreement for this exercise was that we

would keep no copies of the draft reports.nor of our comments on them. Those

letters are informal and not for the record. As I told Mr. Blakey when we met

with him the other day, we are awaiting his call to the Agency to witness the

destruction of this paper. The letters are cited below by date and OLC i-

As we are finished with this phase of the investigation, it would be

appreciated if you would locate and return your copies of these letters

immediately, retaining.no copy for your own records. It is not intended that

we destroy all of these until the final report is published, as we may wish to

draw on the information in the letters if still relevant,

in preparing comments

on the Final Report.
