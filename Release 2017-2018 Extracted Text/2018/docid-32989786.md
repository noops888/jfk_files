- By William séfire

WASHINGON, Nov, 19—On Oct. 10,-
1963, the then-Attornéy General of the
United States put Kis personal signa-
ture on a documenit that launched and

iegitimatized one of the most horren-

dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse~

quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther

“King Jr. is being gingerly examined,

with the “investigation” conducted in

such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or

Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, when~
the commitice counsel first set forth
the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De- 1
partment had existed in 1962; today,”
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robert Kennedy who authorized
‘the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed
their concern of Communist influence

with Dr. King.”

But the Church commitiee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-

-nedy root of this precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone unasked for
thirteen years,

For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wivetap Dr, King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How docs the F.B.I. know the 1
President was consulted or informed?

Aiter Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-
fice, and the wiretapping continued, ;
he was told by angry newsmen that
the FBI. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr. King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic inierceptions, to dis«
continue the officially approved tap?

OF course, this sort af testimony
would erode Senator Church's political
base. That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha
(Deke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnse:
personal contact with the F.B.I. in
witness chair. What did Presicent
Johnson know about the character-
assassination plot and when did f
know it? What conversations took
place between sic. Deloach and Presi-
dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.
King, or about the use of the F.BJ. in

other intrusions into the lives cf

“Mr. Chuych’ Cover-Up

The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are readily available. A couple of
Weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.B.I. man inadvertently started to
blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 with
the apparent knowleage of Attorney!
General Kennedy, The too-willing wit»
ness was promptly shooshed into si
lence, and told that such information
would be developed only in executive
session. Nohody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern of containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-.
Pee a eanses ie casa aa NCacnannOCa Caen

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse then the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the F.B.L,
but the Chirch investigators seem to
be determineti not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.I. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the FB. to spy on political
opponents, who can be brought for- *
ward to tell us all about it? i

But that would cause embarrass:
ment to Democrats, and Senator
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of
agencies only. A new sense of Con-
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee's hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes ea

which nerwork executive made what"
decision under what pressure. i
I have been haranguing patient
readers for years about the doubje
to Democratic ghd ~
ical crimes, and shad
would come wher! the
bardbail precedents set by the ;Ken-
nedy ard Johnson men would bé laid
before the public in damning detail.
Obviously. Demecrat Frank Church
is not the man to do it, His. jowl-
shaking indignation is all too selec-
tive; the trail of high-level responsi-
bitity tor the es committed against
ing and othe's is evidently going
ilowed ta ecal,
. You'd t that after all the
3 been throug in past
WwW Years, our Political leaders would
have learned that the one thing yhat
brirgs you down is ute act of cover-
