OVERFLYING RUSSIA 153
: The next thing we tried was something called'a Salisbury ;

"- screen, a metallic grid.applied to the airplane's undercarriage

in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked
only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.
“Kelly thought it was more ‘practical to. try special iron fer. i
rite paints that would absorb a radar ‘ping rather thai
bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-.
fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's
outer skin and' we experienced overheating engine problems.
But the paint: -loweréd the radar cross section by one order of
magnitude, sq we decided to give it a try. We called these
specially painted airplanes “dirty birds” and shipped the first
one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob
Sieker, took-the U-2 up to over. seventy thousand feet and ;
suddenly radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe
heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-
plate blew off Bob's oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-
stantly inflated. “The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It
took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's. body, An

. autopsy revealed that above seventy. thousand feet he had

suffered ‘acute hypoxia and lost consclousness in only ten
seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate
clasp that ‘cost fifty cents:

The CIA was so desperate to’buy time for these Soviet over-
flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight
engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a.U-2

fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in
its bay. The manual included phony instrument panel photos
with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor
limits. Four copies:were produced and then artificially aged’
with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the

Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
April 1, 1997

1, At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of deatroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton‘s
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI’s office was notified.”

(p. 143) Where are these records?

2 Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CIA’s
Record’s Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?

3, Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?

4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199 from
1959-1964?

5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

6. How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?

7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?


13-00000

MAR 31°97 12:@SPM P.S

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation/ distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would.
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?

9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?

10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?

11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?

12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the
Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How can a search
query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the
Register.

13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a

individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?

14, ARRB’s Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-13, dated
November 1, 1996, contained the following questions:

A. What forms of backchannel communications were there between the
Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters
during 1963? By “backchannel” we mean, inter alia, any administrative,
senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or
electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the
type included in the JFK Collection).

B. Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico

City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963?

2


13-00000

MAR 31°97 12:@6PM P.6

C. To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the
time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov. 1963 (other than.
those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records
available for review.

Why has it been so difficult to answer these questions?

15. ARRB’s Request for Additional Information and Record No. CIA-14, dated
December 23, 1996, documented our request for the annual or biannual Station reports
for Mexico City Station for 1963 and 1964, Why has it been so difficult to provide these
reports?

16. The attached Agency document released in 1996 contains the paragraph:
11. A memorandum marked only for file, 16 March 1967, signed M.D.
Stevens, says that J. Monroe SULLIVAN, #280207, was granted a covert
security approval on 10 December 1962 so that he could be used in Project
QKENCHANT. (Clay) Shaw has # 402897-A.
What do these numbers mean? What does the “A” at the ends of Shaw’s number
signify? Do the files identified by these numbers still exist? Why was Sullivan granted
a covert security approval?
17, During the period 1959-1963, what was the purpose or goal of QKRENCHANT?

18. Under what circumstances were non-agency employees given covert security
clearances for the QKENCHANT project?

19. Did Clay Shaw receive a covert security approval for the QKENCHANT project?
Why was one needed? Did Clay Shaw receive covert security clearances for any
project other than QOKENCHANT

20. What did Clay Shaw do within the QKENCHANT project?

21. Do records exist to account for the disposition of all files on Clay Shaw?

22. Did Howard Hunt have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior to
1964?

23, Did J. Monroe Sullivan have any involvement with the QKENCHANT project prior
to 1964?

assassination conspiracy. It says SHAW spent “some yeaxe"
in Roma as a World Trade Canter leader. Xt claims that

Mr. Dotize, Wouldo't 3, be ueeful though te give—I doo't, want to suggest

ence, Would there mot be some benaltt possibly in giving people im the field the
xemnlt of the experience galued in this particular case?

Mr. Cotaves. Well, the general approach, end other matters related to it,
are touched on tn orientation courses for consular officers and ee om. [ think
ag I look oa Consul Bayder’s actions, that he behaved very much Hike a respon:
aible Foreign Service officer,

Mat happened loag before I wae in the Department, so I. can say that
without any involvement. . But if seemed to me that he did- just what -be
sbould hava done, despite the unfortunate aftermath. And it shows to me, at
Jonnt, that the training and orientation that these people are getting Je right, is
serviceable, and they are able t handle these sitwations ax they.come tn.

Representative Form. If Oswald had perusted that day, October Bl ba o-

woald Snyder have been requived to give it to hina and permit kim to eign it?

Mr, Gusves..I think if it be@ been in ordinary office hoors when the eum-
milate was open for business, and if Soyder was satisfied that he was competent,
thet Oeweld wae competent, he would have t give him the form, yes, sir.

Regiresentative Foxe, Does Snyder have the authority to make a determine’
tion of competency t

Mr. Gaares. No; he docan’t dave the authoriiy to make a deiarmination of
competence, and I suppose it is poasfble at some point to get the lame irled In
court. But E think @ ‘conmlar officer would probably be acting within hia
discretion if be saw eeaboiiy who waa drunk or raving or soniething and Just
said; “Well, I am not going to give you this nail! Lam sre that your action Is
your at.” After all; when the consul accepts the oath, be is certifying that it
