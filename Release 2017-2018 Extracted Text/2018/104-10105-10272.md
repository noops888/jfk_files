I had access to the pages of Mexico's most respected newspapers,
penetrations of the Communist Party of Mexico and the Trotskyite
offshoot and two organizations that could accomplish medium-size 73 .
public demonstrations on call.

From time to time our Mexican agents disrupted Communist
meetings held indoors with CIA-manufactured stink bombs and
‘ itching powder. One such disturbance took place during the well-
attended recantation speech of Communist artist Diego Rivera.

At my request Joe Bryan lent me an artist who spent a month at
the station and turned out enough poster designs so that for several
months a different anti-Communist poster appeared on the walls of
Mexico City each week. These poster campaigns did much to
awaken Mexican public consciousness to the menace of interna-
tional Communism and appeared under the aegis of an organization
headed by a Mexican of unimpeachable reputation.

Along letter from Bob and Maxine North in Bangkok informed
me that Bob's cover work was to establish a Thai film industry, erect
a modern studio and produce a lengthy film reenactment of an epic
Thai legend. For her part, Maxine was learning Thai and improving
her already first-rate golf game. En route Washington for consulta-
tion, Bob spent a few days with me in Mexico City, where we
planned a complicated operation designed to discredit a prominent
Mexican Communist. The operation required critical timing and a
good deal of work by the printing services section of CIA's Technical
Services Division. :

The Mexican Communist leader was then visiting Peking. On the
departure Bob North airmailed me a copy of the English

Announcing his departure, sendiyg a dupli- -
cate copy to CIA headquarters. To replace the departure an-
nouncement I fabricated a story in which the Mexican;Communist
was quoted as deprecating fellow Mexicans and saying,among other
things, that Mexican peasants could never hope to achieve the
cultural level of the superior Chinese. I cabled the fabrication to

headquarters, where a specigl type font had been/made by repro-
ducing samples from the My fabricated story was set.

Bureau target. I agreed in principle, but reminded the ambassador
that CIA had no arrest powers whatever, foreign or domestic. I was
80 emb: ed, of course, that CIA had not known of Greenglass’
presence, much less the instructions given him by Soviet Intelli-

gence

Twenty years later Iwas to learn that what the Bureau had done to
Greenglass, they did routinely to fugitives they were able to locate
abroad.

Thad not taken part in a surreptitious-entry operation since
Sparrow TE burglarized the office of the Italian consul in Shanghai
and photographed his lists of Nazi and Soviet agents in China. That
entry had been hardly surreptitious, with uniformed men piling out
of jeeps and bursting into the consulate, where we set upa Recordak
Gunera and photographed records for many hours, hardly caring
whether the consul appeared or not.
in Mexico City was located two blocks
in an apartment building. From our
CIA offices we had a direct line of sight to the front windows of the
emt which were on the third floor of the apartment building.
According to prescribed form, we cased the target office and
mounted round-the-clock surveillance on the principal embassy

% officers. With the concurrence of the National Security Agency.a
date was fixed for surreptitious entry, and a week or so before that
date a team of CIA safecrackers arrived in town. These highly skilled
men were. part of a small cadre ‘of specialists that traveled, and
perhaps still travel, for entry operations in different parts of the ,

world.
We recruited the charwoman who cleaned th ms °
hassy offices and placed a microphone in the ambassador's office

from which could be heard conversations relayed to an
apartment—the Listening Post—we had rented one floor above.
The microphone installation supplemented telephone taps which
had been active for some time. Several station cars were equipped
with mobile transceivers that operated on frequencies not normally
utilized in Mexico. We had a floor plan of the offices, a description of:
the sife, and a putty imprint of its keyhole. The charwoman pro-
vided us with a key to the embassy service door, and we duplicated
it. Now we were ready to move.

With the aid of binoculars, the interior of the ambassador's office

us of any movement within the/target, and as each staff member left

The word was Go.

Using the duplicate key, the entry team gained access to the
target premises and reported the location dark and quiet. Through
the microphone we could hear them moving quietly around. They
did not really need to transmit to us on their walkie-talkies, for we
could hear their conversations perfectly well.” :

‘The operating procedure followed in this and all other entry’
operations I participated in was to cover all windows with opaque
black muslin, to eliminate the possibility of team flashlights being
seen outside the embassy, then the team went to work on the safe.

Meanwhile, in the basement below, the night watchman was
drinking tequila and playing cards with one of our agents who had
begun his cultivation a month earlier.

Above, the entry team forced a soft metal compound into the safe
keyhole and, when the compound hardened, used it to make a
sturdy duplicate key. Before opening the safe, an amplifying listen-
ing device was applied to the keyhole to detect such sounds as, for
example, the ticking of a time lock or a boohy-trap bomb.

As soon as the safe door was.open, a Polaroid photograph was
taken of the contents and developed on the spot. Later, by referring
to the photograph, everything in the safe could be replaced in its
original position. In a small room off the ambassador's office the
team set up a camera ‘specially designed by CIA for document
photography. Floodlights were plugged into the embassy’s electri-
cal system, and for the next three hours the entire contents of the

n currency but were ordered to leave it there. Photography
completed, the team packed up and withdrew from the target area .

Soon ico City station received lists of Mexicans whom
‘sy had subverted, as well as the names of
prominent Mexicans still on their target lists. Of equal importance
were ambassadorial notes covering his efforts to purchase arms and
munitions in Mexico, a physical description of the ambassador's
Soviet Embassy contact and a number of profiles in which the
ambassador appraised senior officials of the American Embassy.

If we were able to burglarize at will, we were also vulnerable to
Mexican burglars,

An FBI agent and his wife, asleep in their bed, were chloroformed
and their dog killed while burglars removed everything from their
home witha moving van My own home had been entered twice and
looted. We lost my wife's Jewelry, my typewriter, assorted sterling
silver, a radio and other valuables. All these effects were insured,
but Dorothy and 1 preferred to wait, hoping the Mexican police
would produce, at least, her jewelry.

A distinctive sapphire earring of my wife's had been dropped by
the second set of burglars, and with it to go on, its mate was located
in the Thieves Market downtown. Spurred on by the urgings of the
legal attaché and myself, Mexican detectives called daily at my
4 home, assuring me they were following all leads intensively,
; Moreover, the insurance company had offered a large reward for the
return of our stolen valuables.

Presently Iwas summoned to Mexican police headquarters and a
strongboy opened for my inspection. In it was most of my wife's
missing jewelry. I identified it as such, but to my surprise saw the
strongbox closed, locked and removed. The Jewels were needed for
evidence, the detective told me; otherwise the thieves would go
unprosecuted,

Iwas much less interested in a thiefs prosecution than in the
recovery of my wife's valuables, many of which were family heir-
looms. I consulted with the insurers, who indicated that the jewels
j would be released to me as soon as the reward was paid. After this
was done, Iwas again summoned to police headquarters and again
permitted to see my wife's possessions. This time I expected to take

them with me, but no, not just yet. The detective dilated upon the
number of men and man-hours the investigation had consumed and
suggested an additional reward should be forthcoming. I named the
sum already paid him by the insurance company and suggested that
it was quite enough. He closed the lid of the strongbox. IT asked him
what figure he had in mind. He raised the strongbox lid. Five cases
of scotch would do nicely, he told me with a vulpine grin. 1 felt like
shooting him, but bargained him down to three. True at last to his
word, the detective came to my home the following day, turned over
the strongbox to me and carted off three cases of scotch, which, I
knew, he would be able to sell for three or four hundred dollars on
the black market.

Thad been slow to learn the traditional way of dealing with Latin
American policemen, but it was an object lesson I never forgot.

There now arrived from Washington a long dispatch from Beetle
Sunith addressed jointly to the OSO station chief and to myself. The
two stations were to be merged and the overall station chief would
succeed the OSO incumbent. I was named deputy. I accepted the
change with what good grace I could muster, but asked that I be
reassigned. Not long thereafter the new station chief arrived and
within three months my replacement reported to the embassy.

Before departing, Dorothy and I were remarried in her Catholic
faith and our daughters baptized as Catholics. For as long as I could I
kept this intelligence from my parents, for I knew that it would
inevitably produce ill feeling. Then, after a month of farewell parties
and making last-minute purchases and packing, we saw our lift van
tracked away and were driven by friends to the airport.

From there we flew to Florida, where we vacationed in a cottage
given us by Dorothy's mother. Toward the end of my leave I went to
Washington to find a house and receive word of my next assignment.
I was to spend a year or so at headquarters, I was told, as chief of
covert operations for an area of the world with which I had had no
prior experience whatever: the Balkans. :
