I had access to the pages of Mexico's most respected newspapers,

penetrations of the Communist Party uf Mexico and the Trotskyite

offshoot and two organizations that could accomplish medium-size 73.

public demonstrations on call

From time to time our Mexican agents disrupted Communist

meetings held indoors with CIA-manufactured stink bombs and

itching powder. One such disturbance took place during the well-

attended recantation speech of Communist artist Diego Rivera.

At my request Joe Bryan lent me an artist who spent a month at

the station and turned out enough poster designs so that for several

months a different anti-Communist poster appeared on the walls of

Mexico City each week. These poster campaigns did much to

awaken Mexican public consciousness to the menace of interna-

tional Communism and appeared under the aegis of an organization

headed by a Mexican of unimpeachable reputation.

A long letter from Bob and Maxine North in Bangkok informed

me that Bob's cover work was to establish a Thai film industry, erect

a modern studio and produce a lengthy film reenactment of an epic.

Thai legend. For her part, Maxine was learning Thai and improving

her already first-rate golf game. En route Washington for consulta-

tion, Bob spent a few day's with me in Mexico City, where we

planned a complicated operation designed to discredit a prominent

Mexican Communist. The operation required critical timing and a

good deal of work by the printing services section of CIA's Technical

Services Division.

The Mexican Communist leader was then visiting Peking. On the

day of his departure Bob North airmailed me a copy of the English

languagel

announcing his departure, sending a dupli-

cale cops to CIA headquarters. To replace the departure an-

nouncement I fabricated a story in which the Mexican, Communist

Wits quoted as deprecating fellow Mexicans and saying, among other

things, that Mexican peasants could never hope to achieve the

cultural level of the superior Chinese. I cabled the fabrication to

headquarters, where a special type tont had been/made by repro-

Bureau target. I agreed in principle, but reminded the ambassador

that CIA had no arrest powers whatever, foreign or domestic. I was

80 embarrassed, of course, that CIA had not known of Greenglass

presence, much less the instructions given him by Soviet Intelli-

gence.

Twenty years later I was to learn that what the Bureau had done to

Greenglass, they did routinely to fugitives they were able to locate

abroad.

I had not taken part in a surreptitious-entry operation since

ofjeeps and bursting into the consulate, where we set up a Recordak

camera and photographed records for many hours, hardly caring

whether the consul appeared or not.

Embassy in Mexico City was located two blocks

from Are American Embassy in an apartment building. From our

CIA offices we had a direct line of sight to the front windows of the

embassy, which were on the third floor of the apartment building.

According to prescribed form, we cased the target office and

bassy offices and placed a microphone in the ambassador's office

from which could be heard conversations relajed to an

apartment-the Listening Post-we had rented one floor above.

The microphone installation supplemented telephone taps which

had been active for some time. Several station cars were equipped

with mobile transceivers that operated on frequencies not normally

utilized in Mexico. We had a floor plan of the offices, a description of

the safe, and a putty imprint of its keyhole. The charoman pro-

vided us with a key to the embassy service door, and we duplicated

it. Now we were ready to move.

With the aid of binoculars, the interior of the ambassadors otice

us of any movement within the/target, and as each staff member left

the offices that Friday afternoon, they were followed to their homes

eleven that night surveillance reported most of the staft members

asleep and the remaining few accoupied for. A precautionary tele-

phone call was placed to thel

Embassy; through the

pickup mike we could hear it ring repeatedly, but no one answered.

The word was Go.

Using the duplicate key, the entry team gained access to the

target preinises and reported the location dark and quiet. Through

the microphone we could hear them moving quietly around. They

did not really need to transmit to us on their walkie-talkies, for we

could hear their conversations perfectly well.

The operating procedure followed in this and all other entry

operations I participated in was to cover all windows with opaque

black muslin, to eliminate the possibility of team flashlights being

seen outside the embassy, then the team went to work on the safe.

Neanshile, in the basement below, the night watchman was

drinking tequila and playing cards with one of our agents who had

begun his cultivation a month earlier.

Above, the entry team forced a soft metal compound into the safe

keyhole and, when the compound hardened, used it to make a

ing device was applied to the keyhole to detect such sounds as, for

esample, the ticking of a time lock or a boohy-trap bomb.

licken of the contents and developed on the spot. Later, by referring

lu the photograph, everything in the safe could be replaced in its

original position. In a small room off the ambassador's office the

loside an inner drawer the team found more than $30,000 in

American currency but were ordered to leave it there. Photography

completed, the team packed up and withdrew from the target area

in reverse order, removing the blackout drapes just before they left.

Belore clawn the entry team had flown from Mexico to Dallas,

The code-book film was sent at once to NSA, and the rest of the

filme documents were examined at leisure by interested sections of

Embassy had subverted, as well as the names of

prominent Mexicans still on their target lists. Of equal importance

sere ambassadorial notes covering his efforts to purchase arms and

munitions in Mexico, a physical description of the ambassador's

Soviet Embassy contact and a number of profiles in which the

ambassador appraised senior officials of the American Embassy.

If we were able to burglarize at will, we svere also vulnerable to

Mesican burglars.

An FBI agent and his wife, asleepin their bed, were chloroformed

and their dog killed while burglars removed everything from their

home witha moving van. My own home had been entered twice and

looted. We lost my wife's jewelry, my typewriter, assorted sterling

silver, a radio and other valuables. All these effects were insured,

but Dorothy and I preferred to wait, hoping the Mexican police

would produce, at least, her jewelry.

A distinctive sapphire earring of my wife's had been dropped by

the second set of burglars, and with it to go on, its mate was located

in the Thieves Market downtown. Spurred on by the urgings of the

legal attaché and myself, Mexican detectives called daily at my

home, assuring me

they were following all leads intensively.

Moreover, the insurance company had offered a large reward for the

return of our stolen valuables.

Presently Isas summoned to Mexican police headquarters and a

strongbos opened for my inspection. In it was most of my wife's

missing jewelry. I identified it as such, but to my surprise saw the

strongbox closed, locked and removed. The jewels were needed for

evidence, the detective told me; otherwise the thieves would go

improsecuted

I was much less interested in a thiefs prosecution than in the

secovers of my wife's valuables, many of which were family heir-

looms. I consulted with the insurers, who indicated that the jewels

would be released to me as soon as the reward was paid. After this

them with me, but no, not just yet. The detective dilated upon the

number of men and man-hours the investigation had consumed and

suggested an additional reward should be forthcoming. I named the

sum already paid him by the insurance company and suggested that

it was quite enough. He closed the lid of the strongbox. I asked him

what figure he had in mind. He raised the strongbox lid. Five cases

of scotch would do nicely, he told me with a vulpine grin. I felt like

shooting him, but bargained him down to three. True at last to his

sorel, the detective came to my home the following day, turnedover

the strongbox to me and carted off three cases of scotch, which, I

knew, he would be able to sell for three or four hundred dollars on

the black market.

I had been slow to learn the traditional way of dealing with Latin

American policemen, but it was an object lesson I never forgot.

There now arrived from Washington a long dispatch from Beetle

Smith addressed jointly to the OSO station chief and to myself. The

tro stations were to be merged and the overall station chief would

succeed the OSO incumbent. I was named deputy. I accepted the

change with what good grace I could muster, but asked that I be

reassigned. Not long thereafter the new station chief arrived and

within three months my replacement reported to the embassy.

Before departing, Dorothy and I were remarried in her Catholic

faith and our daughters baptized as Catholics. For as long as I could I

hept this intelligence from my parents, for I knew that it would

invitably produce ill feeling. Then, after a month of farewell parties

and making last-minute purchases and packing, we saw our lift van

trucked away and were driven by friends to the airport.

From there we flew to Florida, where we vacationed in a cottage

given us by Dorothy's mother. Toward the end of my leave I went to

Wishington to find a house and receive word of my next assignment.

I was to spend a year or so at headquarters, I was told, as chief of

covert operations for an area of the world with which I had had no

prior experience whatever: the Balkans.

century the Colorados were defeated, and at that night's victory

The new police chief was an Army colonel who knew nothing
