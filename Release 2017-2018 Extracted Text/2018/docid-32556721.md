It is suggested that I reply to ODE as follows:

In past years, the Swiss Police have been
requested to furnish any information they might have con-
cerning the activities and contacts of GUS ALEX while in
Switzerland, in view of his association with individuals
with criminal records. In February 1965 the Swiss

i authorities issued an entry ban against ALEX. No request
| was made to the Swiss authorities for an entry ban against
ALEX, nor was it indicated to them that such would. be
desirable.

It is understood from Swiss sources that the
Swiss authorities cannot be legally required to reveal
the reason for the issuance of an entry ban.

The foregoing is furnished for the information
of the Department of State and it is requested that it
not be disseminated outside that agency.

In view of the statement in the letter of
FREDERICK SMITH, JR., that he had not yet heard from the FBI,
it is presumed that he has made inquiry of the Bureau in this
matter.

The Bureau is therefore requested to review
what information, if any, was furnished Mr. SMITH, and then
inform if it considers the above information appropriate to
furnish ODE. Mr. ODE has indicated that he would greatly
appreciate expedite action by me in this case.
