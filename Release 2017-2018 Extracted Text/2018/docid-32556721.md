Reurairtel 3/25/66.

You should advise Robert C. Ode, Consular section,

the Embassy, that we do not know one reason for Swiss

authorities issuing a travel ban against the subject and are,

therefore, not in position to advise him concerning this

situation.

There is no record of a request having been received

by the Bureau from the Department of State relative to this and

consequently no information has

been furnished.

This is for your information and in handling this

matter you are again reminded of previous instructions that

precaution is to be exercised in order to assure that the

Bureau is not disclosed as. a source of information and does

not become involved in

any court or other legal proceedings

concerning this matter.

It is suggested that I reply to ODE as follows:

In past years, the Swiss Police have been

requested to furnish any information they might have con-

cerning

the activities and contacts of GUS ALEX while in

Switzerland, in view of his association with individuals

with criminal records. In February 1965 the Swiss

authorities issued an

entry ban against ALEX. No request

was made to the Swiss authorities for an entry ban against

ALEX, nor was it indicated to them that such would. be

desirable.

It is understood from Swiss sources that the

Swiss

authorities cannot be legally required to reveal

the reason for the issuance of an entry ban.

The foregoing is furnished for the information

of the Department of State and it is requested that it

not be disseminated outside that agency.

In view of the statement in the letter of

FREDERICK SMITH, JR., that he had not yet heard from the FBI,

it is presumed that he has made inquiry of the Bureau in this

matter.

The Bureau is therefore requested to review

what information, if any, was furnished Mr. SMITH, and then

inform if it considers the above information appropriate to

furnish ODE. Mr. ODE has indicated that he would greatly

appreciate expedite action by me in this case.
