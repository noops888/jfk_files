Cuban police, Other persons which were apprehended for Plotting,
with Cubela, against the regime, were Ramon GUIN, Alberto Blanco,
(FNU) GALLARRETA, and two unidentified Cubans. (Source denied

thing was going on). Source was never interrogated by the

not discussed during the occasion, Gonzalez attended Cubela's
trial accompanying Cubela's mother. Source could not provide

authorities knew everything about the plot: Cubela made

about a one-hour long speech on his behalf; in his speech he
admitted he had had a meeting in a hotel in Madrid with ARTIMES
( fou) a Cuban exile, Alberto Blanco, and ROBENO (fnu), alias

Gonzalez thought of an opportunity of leaving Cuba with the
help of Peyrot. He married Peyrot two or three munths after
they first met. Peyrot made an attempt to get an Uruguayan
visa for Gonzalez, and in her attempt she made a long distance H i.
telephone call, to Uruguay, to an Uruguayan doctor named Carmen H j .
(lau), who Peyrot claimed was the personal doctor of the Uruguayan :
Minister of Interior. Peyrot also told Source that Carmen was H
the one who got ‘her into accepting the Cuban contract. Failing {
to get an Uruguayan visa for Gonzalez, Peyrot opted for paying a
Gonzalez airplane fare to Madrid. Source had limited knowledge
ef Peyrot's background. She had been in Cuba from 1963 to 1964.
| Gonzalez became suspicious that Peyrot was cither working for
the Cuban intelligence or the CIA, when‘she began asking hir
captious questions about himself. In public, openly and unafraid,
she expressed disaffection toward the Cuban regime. At an
occasion, she suggested to Gonzalez, that once he arrived in
. Spain, to contact Robeno "El Mago", in Barcelona, and to join
him in working for. the CIA. .Six months. prior to her departure
from Cuba Peyrot visited, two or.three times a week, an office
i of an alleged Brazilian dentist, that was located in a building
: in front of El Hotel Capri, 2Ist Strect, Havana. Source never
i met the Brazilian dentist. In November 1968, Peyrot supposed
f to have left Cuba for Uruguay via Mexico. Source, and other ( easssaeeeaneaeeeD
4 unidentified friends, who went to the airport to say good-by ~~ 7
to Peyrot the day she left Cuba, did not see.her.taking the {
Mexico airplane flight, though the passcrgers were easily. '
distinguished when they were entering the airplane. Shortly
after Peyrot left Cuba (date unknown), Gonzalez divorced her
on the grounds of default. (Field Comment: Source had a F .
difficult time remembering the dates in reference to his |
_ personal history. He seemed to be anxious’ to cooperate, and
_ said that he was going to write to his present wife (now in |
the U.S.), and ask her to send him a copy.of his divorce papers, t
in order to confirm some of the dates. which he-was not sure of. |

doctor was mentioned by Julio RIVAS Delgado (see Memorandum for e
the Record to cas dated 20 November 1968, paragraph 22),
where Rivas stated le has visited the Cuban Embassy in
Madrid at approximately the same period Mirtha PEYROT left Cuba.
Though it may be coincidental, it is probable that Mirtha Peyrot
and Myrta Teijeiro are the same person. ‘Source did not divulge
any information on his past associations with Mirtha Peyrot in
his initial interrogation at the Cuban Reception Office (ORC),
because he was afraid of discussing sensitive matters with the
ORC interrogator. He stated that he has a seven-year old son
4m Cuba, and is afraid that the Cuban authorities may take !
Yrepraisals by not letting his son exit Cuba if they, the Cuban of
authorities, would find out that he has brought the subject of |
Peyrot to the attention of the Cuban interrogator at. the ORC.
Source stated that he is willing.to cooperate in any wiy: possible
