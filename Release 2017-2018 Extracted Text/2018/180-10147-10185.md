When he first came into prominence as a Cuban exile

Rad
leader, Manuel Ray Rivero was ‘described as "“softspoken and H \7
unassuming", a person of “highest intellect, sincerity and
conviction" -- in other words, a natural leader.” In 1947, 6
the 23-year old Ray was granted a scholarship by the Cuban v
Ministry of Public Works to study civil engineering at the A
University of utah.” Ray was in the United States for two (;

years before returning to his native Cuba in 1949 and

obtaining various positions in the engineering field, one of
which was project manager for the construction of the

Havana Hilton Hotel.

Reacting. to the excesses of the military~ruie of
Fulgencio Batista, Ray organized the Civic Resistance Movement é
in 1957 and began supervising sabotage and acts of terrorism v
against the government. His political posture and éctive a
resistance to Batista was recognized by Fidel Castro who, D
upon assuming control of the government of Cuba, appsinted
Ray his Minister of Public Works in February 1959.” Within a ‘i
few months of his appointment, Ray confided to Pewee -
Cubans that he had recognized the symptoms of ‘Communism. in ¢
the Castro regime but was not prepared to conspire azainst i

according to one source, Ray did not leave Castro because of
ideological or policy discrepancies but rather because ‘of a

personality clash with Castro's Minister of Labor who almost

Hubert Matos a traitor and execute the Cuban revolutionary

opinions about Ray, among them Dr. Jose Miro Cardona, president

of the FRD. Miro opposed Ray because he considered his
program too Marxist3?1 and declared that Ray was bitterly
anti-American as well as probably totalitarian in his think-

Ray received full operational approval as a "political

resisted inclusion into the.FRD. He.said he felt the members

| Ray withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs
invasion. In a Miami news conference on May 28, 1961, he said

the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the

Council had failed to live up to the written promises given

4 it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before
joining the organization. 4° The first condition had been that
the Council was to give first priority to the underground .
ighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion- Secondly,
Ray had insisted that anyone too closely associated with the

Batista regime would not be used in the invasion. Also, he

said, he was to have been allowed prior approval of any appoint-_

ment of invasion military leaders. 41 Ray told the assembled

é

? newsmen that his program to overthrow Castro was based on 5
ia; maximum mobilization of the discontented people inside Cuba,

3 and that he thought the leadership: of this underground should f

; come from Cubans who could prove they had access to such a 2

j potential force. 42 i i | g

Ray sought CIA support for the MRP independent of the p

| council, 43 claiming that the group had an effective underground :

j . i
: organization but needed material and financial support. 44

Ray

v felt the MRP had to be allowed to plan its own operations and
_broaden its base of financial support to include sympathetic
Latin American sovernents. He was totally opposed to another
