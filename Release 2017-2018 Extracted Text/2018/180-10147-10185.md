When he first came into prominence as a Cuban exile

leader, Manuel Ray Rivero was described as "softspoken and

unassuming", a person of "highest intellect, sincerity and

1

conviction" - in other words, a natural leader.

In 1947,

the 23-year old Ray was granted a scholarship by the Cuban

Ministry of Public Works to study civil engineering at the

2

University of Utah.

Ray was in the United States for two

, years before returning to his native Cuba in 1949 and

obtaining various positions in the engineering field, one of

which was project manager for the construction of the

Havana Hilton Hotel. 3

Reacting: to the excesses of the military iule oi

Fulgencio Batista, Ray organized the Civic Resistance Movement

in 1957 and began supervising sacotage and acts of terrorism

4

against the government.

His political posture and active

resistance to Batista was recognized by Fidel Castro who,

upon assuming control of the government of Cuba, appointed

5

Ray his Minister of Public Works

in February 1959. within a

Few months of his appointment, Ray confided to two acti-Castro

Cubans that he had

recognized the symptoms of Comnurism- in

the Castro regime but was not prepared to conspire aminst

"El Lider Maximo."

according to one source, Ray did not leave Castro because of

ideological or policy discrepancies but rather because of a

personality clash with Castro's Minister of

Labor who almost

shot Ray after a stormy Cabinet meeting." Another theory

about his leaving was that he opposed Castro's plan to declare

Hubert Matos a traitor and execute the Cuban revolutionary

hero with whom Ray had been associatea.?

For whatever reason, Ray did continue to permit his name

to be associated with the Castro regime!' until May i960

when he formed the Revolutionary Movement of the People (MRP)"

The MRP wasanti-Castro organization which believed that

the ideas and aims of the democratic left best suited the

needs and aspirations of the Cuban people. 12 It did not wish

to reinstate the 1940 Cuban Constitution, rather it favored

continuation of the laws passed by Castro at the beginnirg of

his regime 3

and advocated the regulation of private investment

and nationalization of all utilities. I4 Associated with Ray

in this underground organization were Raul Chibas, Ramon

Barquin, Rogelio Cisneros, 15 Rufo Lopez Fresquet and Felipe

Pazos. 16

Organized

in each of Cuba's six provinces, the MRP was

considered the most important underground group. l7 working

and was supplied with explosives

sent by launches from the

Florida Keys.

Having waited until May, 1960 to organize his resistance

group, Ray was criticized as being suspiciously tardy to the

anti-Castro movnement. 20 Chargés of "Fidelism without Fidel"

were made against him and the MRP because of their leftist

ideologies. 21

Perhaps for these reasons, Ray's background

Some prontioeftA Cubatrolletigasntalso expressed negative

opinions about Ray, among them DI. Jose Miro Cardona, president

of the FRD. Miro opposed Ray because he considered his

program too Marxist3l and declared that Ray was bitterly

anti-American as well as probably totalitarian in his think-

ing. 32 Manuel Artime, head of the Movimento Recuperacion

Revolucionaria (MRR), noted that Ray's group was opposed to

banning the Communist Party and in favor of "nationalizing

everything. "33 Although aware of his controversial political

philosophy, the ell continued to astivedy recruit kay to join

the FRaid secause the White House and State Department pushed

for his inclusion. 35

Ray received full operational approval as a "political

asset" on February 7, 196136 but resisted joining the newly

formed Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) just as he had

resisted inclusion into the FRD.

He said he felt the members

of the CRC were too restrained and he did not want to become

a part of a situation in which someone else was running the

show for the exiles. 37 However, Three weeks before the Bay of

Pigs invasion, ray was persuaded to join the CRC as a show of

unity. 38

In recalling the events of this period, Ray told HSCA

investigators that he was avare of the fact that certain in-

fluential and wealthy Americans, among then former. Ambassador

William Pawley, were opposed to him and that a lot of heavy

propaganda vastlassificatiarated aceusing him of being a

Ray withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs

invasion. In a Miami news conference on May 28, 1961, he said

the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the

Council had failed to live up to the written promises given

it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before

joining the organization. 40

The first condition had been that

the Council was to give first priority to the underground

fighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion. Secondly,

Ray had insisted that anyone too closely associated with the

Batista

regime would not be used in the invasion. Also, he

said, he was to have been allowed prior approval of any appoint-

ment of invasion military leaders. 41 Ray told the assemblea

newsmen that his program to overthrow Castro was based on

maximum mobilization of the discontented people inside Cuba,

and that he thought the leadership of this underground should

come from Cubans who could prove they had access to such a

potential force.

42

Ray sought CIA support for the MRP independent of the

Council, 43 claiming that the group had an effective underground

organization but needed material and financial support.

44 Ray

felt the MRP had to be allowed to plan its own operations and

broaden its base of financial support to include sympathetic

Latin American governments. 45 He was totally opposed to another

46

attempt.

CIA headquarters was immediate: Within 24 hours a Memo foa

was reviewed. 49

Ray went to Puerto Rico about July, 1961, where he

received sympathetic support for the MRP from the Governor

of that island, Luis Munoz Marin, who personally liked Ray. 50

While Ray was in Puerto Rico, a member of the MRP underground

in Cuba reported to the MRP Exécutive Council that he had been

in contact with the ClA and was told by the Ageney that no

material resources would be available for the group until

Manuel. Ray was dismissed as general coordinator.51 Charging

the CrA

with repeated interference in the affairs of the MRP,

Ray resigned so that there wouldn't be any obstacle to the

group's cohesion. 52

In October, 1961, the Puerto Rican Planning Board an-

nounced that Ray had accepted a $12,000-a-year position as

consultant to that Board. 53

Although there was no evidence

that the Puerto Rican government was supporting the MRP, Ray

looked upon with great favor by Puerto Rican officials 54

filtration plans were known throughout the Miami Cuban exile

community.

Soon the story spread to Cuba where Castro ordered

a full-scale military alert and rounded up scores of suspected

After several days of bad weather and dodging Cuban patrol

boats, Ray and his crew of seven,

were heavily patrolled by Castro forces and by the British who

owned them.

entry into the Bahamas and took them to Nassau.
