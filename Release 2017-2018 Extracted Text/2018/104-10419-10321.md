- Subject, it is obvious, had been a source of information
regarding an alleged discussion of the assassination of President
Kennedy at a secret meeting of the Fair Piay for Cuba Committee:
held in Chicage in February 1963 under the direction of Richard...
GRILEY ($346,116)... He. also was the source of information regarding -

‘the alleged attempted reeruitment into the Communist Party of young |.
Cubans in the Chicago area by one Guillermo ESCOBAR, who accord:
ing to the Chicago office was "one of Horace SPEED's (SAS) leads:
obtained from Ralph PEREZ."" (Presumably Ralph. PEREZ,. #444260).
SPEED. is Horace SPEED Ii, 3199499... The documents. also indicated.

, that in February 1964 CAIN was the subject of a conversation initiated
by Eldon S. COHEN, #38557 o/c, with a representative of the DCS
Chicago office who believed his purpose was.te learn whether. or not,
CAIN was in fact on a two-month's. sick leave from the COOK County...
Sheriff's office, ao he was said to be, or was on a political under
cover assignment which CHEN inferred involved tapping the tele-
phones of gubernatorial candidate Charles H. PERCY and other

political figures. .

3. During review of CAIN's Secu: file, I noted 2 message .
regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962 which mentioned .

a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that _
CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. I (Acopy of this memo-
