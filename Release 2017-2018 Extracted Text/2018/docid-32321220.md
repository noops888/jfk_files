security informants (SI), Cuban sources,

sources of information,

confidential sources

(CS) and established sources; release

foreign counterintelligence information.

(U) The staff of the ARRB advised the JFKTF that the

board members have reconsidered their position on the true name

identities of informants who are living and did not provide

any information when contacted about the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy.

The ARRB will now approve the

postponement of those individuals, whether they are Communist

Party sources, Cuban sources of criminal informants, as long as

the JFKTF can

verify that the person is still living.

The JFKTE

conducts searches ön the identities to provide the Butte

Information Technology Center with as much identifying

information found through research. However, in most cases no

information can be found through name searches at Headquarters

and in the reporting field office.

Therefore, the evidence that

JFKTE reports to the ARRB is that there is no information

available or give a date of birth.

The ARRB. will not approve

postponements without verification of the individuals living

(U) The ARRB also advised the JEKTF of their tentative

schedule for their meeting

dates through November 1996. The

dates are:

6/4-5/96;6/25-26/96; 719-10/96; 8/5-6/96; 9/16-

17/96; 10/15-16/96; 10/29-30; and 11/13-14/96. These dates

should be noted since the JFKTE will advise NSD and CID of the

ARRB's determinations and

seek recommendations from them as soon

as the JEKTE is unofficially notified of their decisions.

(U)

The 60 documents pertaining to the decisions from

the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed

below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through

research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D),

on 5/29/96, the Assassination Records Review

Board

(ARRB) voted to release information in 60 documents that would

reveal the identities of 114 individuals who were described as

potential criminal informants (PCI), potential security

informants (PSI),

security informants (SI), cuban sources,

sources of information, confidential sources (CS) and established

sources. (U)

NSD has reviewed referenced Electronic Communication

(EC) and requests

that the JFK Task Force pursue appeal of

documents containing FBI informant identities and symbol numbers,

where indicated, in the documents attached to this EC numbered as

follows:

#54

NSD continues to maintain that the identity of bonafide

sources/informants should not be released since these individuals

have received expressed promises of confidentiality.

To violate

this promise of confidentiality would serve to undermine the

FBI's ability to obtain vital information from potential future

sources of information and, even more important, jeopardize the

personal

families. NSD disagrees with the ARRB position that the

historical aspect of the release of the identity of these

individuals outweighs the potential harm to them.

Once

confidentiality is granted, the FBI is obligated to protect the

identity of bona fide sources/ informants absent statements by

to the contrary. (U)
