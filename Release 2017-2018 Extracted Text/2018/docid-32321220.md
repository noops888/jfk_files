at meetings held 5/13 - 14/1996. The ARRB letter will list 147
documents for which the ARRB made determinations. The FBI is in
agreement with the ARRB's determination to postpone or open

FBI's reconsideration request. The remaining 60 documents the
ARRB voted to sustain some, but not all of the information

security informants (SI), Cuban sources, sources of information,
confidential sources (CS) and established sources; release
foreign counterintelligence information.

(U) The staff of the ARRB advised the JFKTF that the
board members have reconsidered their position on the true name
identities of informants who are living and did not provide
any information when contacted about the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. The ARRB will now approve the
postponement of those individuals, whether they are Communist
Party sources, Cuban sources or criminal informants, as long as
the JFKTF can verify that the person is still living. The JFKTF
conducts searches on the identities to provide the Butte
Information Technology Center with as much identifying
information found through research. However, in most cases no
information can be found through name searches at Headquarters
and in the reporting field office. Therefore, the evidence that
the JFKTF reports to the ARRB is that there is no information
available or give a date of birth. The ARRB will not approve
postponements without verification of the individuals living
status.

(U) The ARRB also advised the JFKTF of their tentative
schedule for their meeting dates through November 1996. The
dates are: 6/4-5/96; 6/25-26/96; 7/9-10/96; 8/5-6/96; 9/16-
17/96; 10/15-16/96; 10/29-30; and 11/13-14/96. These dates
should be noted since the JFKTF will advise NSD and CID of the
ARRB's determinations and seek recommendations from them as soon
as the JFKTF is unofficially notified of their decisions.

(U) The 60 documents pertaining to the decisions from
the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed
below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through
research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D)
no record (NR) or date of birth (DOB).

(U) 1. HQ 105-82555-3899 (7/159), NAR 124-10018-

Electronic Communication from Information Resources Division,
FOIPA/JFK, to National Security Division, dated 6/5/96
Re: JFK Task Force (U)

On 5/29/96, the Assassination Records Review Board
(ARRB) voted to release information in 60 documents that would
reveal the identities of 114 individuals who were described as
potential criminal informants (PCI), potential security
informants (PSI), security informants (SI), Cuban sources,
sources of information, confidential sources (CS) and established
sources. (U)

NSD has reviewed referenced Electronic Communication
(EC) and requests that the JFK Task Force pursue appeal of
documents containing FBI informant identities and symbol numbers,
where indicated, in the documents attached to this EC numbered as

follows:
#1 thru #12
#14 thru #38
#54

NSD continues to maintain that the identity of bonafide
sources/informants should not be released since these individuals
have received expressed promises of confidentiality. To violate
this promise of confidentiality would serve to undermine the
FBI's ability to obtain vital information from potential future
sources of information and, even more important, jeopardize the
personal safety of informants still living and their respective
families. NSD disagrees with the ARRB position that the
historical aspect of the release of the identity of these
individuals outweighs the potential harm to them. Once
confidentiality is granted, the FBI is obligated to protect the
identity of bona fide sources/informants absent statements by
them to the contrary. (U)

#13 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release of
information concerning certain aspects of the microphone
surveillance of Marina Oswald's residence based on a
recommendation from the Advanced Telephony Unit, Engineering
Research Section of the FBI at Quantico, VA. (HO(u)

ffect on foreign relations between the United States and Russia,
as well as other countries, should they be epee =e with public
confirmation of the U.S. Government's ations] Soviet
diplomatic and other telephone conversations |

#40 thru #50 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the
release of information that would reveal telephone surveillance
of the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. and investigation of
Soviet Officials. As articulated by the Task Force,
investigative methods and techniques such as telephone
surveillance may vary in application, but do not normally
diminish in importance with time. Public exposure of the FBI's
specific use of same would cause harm to the FBI's foreign
counterintelligence investigative capabilities. In addition, the
Russian Government would likely complain that technical coverage
of their Embassy or diplomats in the United States constituted a
violation of the Vienna convention. -Finally, the United States
is currently allied with Russia, with Russian troops under
United States command in Bosnia; and the FBI is currently
attempting to establish friendly relations with Russian
Government officials to fight terrorism, organized crime, drugs
and other criminal activities. Revelation of our investigation
of a Soviet official and use of technical surveillance would harm
these developing relationships and could cause the Russian
Government to feel compelled to publicly address these
embarrassing revelations. (g)()

#51 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release of
information which reveals technical surveillance of Hungarian
officials or establishments as such disclosure would compromise
investigative methods and harm U.S. foreign relations with
Hungary raising much the same concerns as are addressed above
with regard to Russia. (3) (wo

#52 & #53 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release
of FBI file numbers concerning the Soviet Union,{India and
Yugoslavia. Two such file numbers to be released contain top
secret code word information received from NSA concerning Russia
and India which NSA believed were of investigative interest to
the FBI. To reveal this file number would reveal NSA's highly
sensitive interception of traffic concerning Russia and India and
the FBI's interest therein] (S)

#55 & #56 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release
of information which reveals technical surveillance of the Polish
Government's newspaper and investigation of Polish officials as
such disclosure would compromise investigative methods and 2
