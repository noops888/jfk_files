MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: EEPORT OF INTERROGATION
DATE: 30 July 1965

1. Today's interrrogation consisted of two short sessions
(1410-1515, afd 1610-1650). Subject was confronted witb proof
of bis errore on Komsomol regulations, and also of basic
georgraphy in Kaliningrad Cblast. Questioning was confined
to these two areas, and #iil be described below. In addition,
there were some interesting additional indications that
Subject may have spent soxe time in Soviet jail or prison
comp.

2, KOMSOHOL:

a) Dospite a number of leading questions and hints,
Subject was unable to recall that Komsonol Congress (the
12th) took place in February 1954, while he was allegedly
the Secretary of the SCD K/O. If he had really been a
Komsowol Secretary at the time he-should remember: the Congress
very well, since he would have been involved in its preparations.
Told about it, Subject said that such Congresses took place
practically every year. This is false; the previous Koasomol

2 the Lith, was ia 1949:-

b) Subject again stated that he was. sure that the
faximum age for Koesonol uewbers at that time was 27. Subject
was shown the pertinent Komsomol reguations for the period,
which provide that the maximum age is 26. Subject simply
continued to ingist that he is sure that he waa excluded
from the Kougomol in 1954 when he reached the age of 27, and*
that no exceptions were sade for him. He did not comment on
how he could be wrong on the reg@lations if he had been a
EKomsomol Secretary.

ec) In the discussion of Komsomol regulations, Subject
continued to insist that the dues wero 2% fur all menbers.
He spotted the paragraph about 2% entry dues in the regulations
that were shown to bim and ga d that monthly dues were
identical with entry dues. This is not eo, but as we do not
have @ copy of the 1949 membership dues scale, I was not
able to stow bim documentary proof of his error. __

4) Subject was again unable to degcribe how he was
permanently registered as a meaber of the MVD K/O, bow be
perforesd his duties ag a Secretary or what these duties
were in connection with the 12th Domsomol Congress, or to
mame the Secretary of the KVD K/O.

~. 3. Service in the Baltic: _In the course of the discussion
of bis service in the Baltic in 1952, Subject made such in-
credible errors, and gave such lame descriptidns of his work,
that it is necessary to conclude that he did not serve there
as an intelligence officer, aud that if he has ever visited
that area at all it waa only very briefly.

a) Subject not only was uhable to name the Chief of
Intelligence of the 4th Naval Fleet, he cowid not even give
his proper title (be insisted that bis official designation
was “nachalnik razvedki;.” actually, of course, it should be
“nachalnik razvedyvatelnogo upravieniya” of the 4th fleet).

b) Subject does not know the name of his immediate
commanding officer, the chief of the MEP. Subject did not
know the names of sore than two of bis fellow officers at
the MEP. In an effort to answer this question he gave a
same - YELISEYEV - that he bad not once wentioned when under
Gimilar pressure in April 1964; it is apparent that he invented
it om: the spot.

, ¢) Bubject continued to insist that ho served in’

‘>. “Gewetsk, Primorskiy Kray.” Subject vas thes shown a wap,
and found that the name of the place where he had allegedly’
gerved was in fact Primorsk. Subject said that be couldn't
understand why be bad remembered it ss Sovetsk, and id
that he had never been in the city of Sovetsk. Subject was
also shown the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the
USSR, and conceded tbat there is no Primorskiy Kray in the -
Soviet Union except the one in the Far East. Again. he had
no explanation for his error. Oddly, after initially con-
ceding his error, from tise to time Subject continued to
Bay that he thought that he was probably rignt after all,
and that the village of Sovetsk was too sgall to appear on
the map that be was shown.

a) In describing his initial arrival at the _
Subject said that he arrived in Kalingrad, then had to go?
by car from Kalingrad to Baltiysu because there was no.

railvay to.Baltiysk. He then went..by cas from Baltiysk to
Prisorsk. In reality there vas and is a rail connection
from Kalingrad to Baltigsk, which passes through. (Subject
vas not. told this, bovever.)

e) Subject admitted that be did not do any operational
work at the MEP, and said that was why be was dissatisfied
and. wanted @ transfer. However, Subject could not give a
description of-what bis duties vere.
done so often in the past, be attempted to divert
ionming by launching into what is evidently a pre-
pared lecture about the baa of Shela operations.

He was cut off.

4. (NOTE: In talking about his service in Kaliningrad
Oblast, Subject has mentioned Primorgk, Sovetsk, and Zelenogradsk.
It ie interesting that towns of identical or closely similar
nanss also exist in Leningrad Oblast: Prinorsk, Sovetskiy, and
Zelenogorsk. Both Zelenogradse and Zelenogorsk are resorts.
The Primorsak and Sovietekiy in Leningrad Oblest are both oa
the. coast, about 10-12 kilometers froa each other. Bearing
in. mind that Bubject has previously described working in the »
woods in Leningrad Oblast in 1945 under conditions that sound
very similar to forced labor, it is possible that there is
sone clue here as to how Subject's legend was prepared. At
this stage, however, it is not possible to draw any firm
conclusions and th@ coincidence is simply noted for future
reference.)

S. In the course of the four days of interrogation to
Gate, there have been a number of indicagions which tend to
confirm previous ispressions that Subject may have spent
Gome time ai prisoner in a Soviet jail or prison camp. i
4s gone of these have not been noted in the previous inter-
tbecobdeha reports it may be convenient to sumearize thes

FO:

a) On 28 July Subject made the intriguing remakk,
“tyuremnyy opyt otrabatyvalsya." This was in answer to ny
question about how he kept track of the days.

b) On 30 July, Subject voluntarily Isunched into a
long and detailed explanation of how he keeps track of the
éays in bis: present circumstances. A poasible explanstion
for this ensolicited description is that Bubject had. reflected.
on the implications of his remakk on 28 uly. i

c) On 26 July, while — was asking Subject about the
guuber of his Party menberabip card (which he did not remember)
Subject said, "I don't even remember my personal KGB number."
I temediately asked Subject when such personal serial numbers
had been instituted in the KGB, and he replied that be didn't
remember, that no one carried them with them but kept them in
the safe, that they were intended for wartine purposes.

COMMENT: Personal serial numbers never existed either.
in the army or in the KGB, and to the best of our km
ledge they do not exist now. The only place in Soviet
society whore such numbers existed ia in the prison
camps: this wes one of the chief grievances and com
plaints that the prisoners made in the fasour VYorkuta
uprisings of 1953.

d) In previous interrogations Subject has described
working in the forests cuteide of Leningrad for two months
in 1944. The conditions that he described sound much sore
like forced labor than that of a military unit,

@) Although tattooing is certainly practised to sous
extent in the Soviet Navy, Komsomol and Party pressures
restrict this to a considerable degree. The nusbor and extent

of Subject’s tattoos is more characteristic of young jailbirds..

2) Bubject's account of the handshooting episode
suggests one possible vay that he might have wound up in
jail. Certainly this incident could sot have been taken as
Lightly in wartime as he would have us believe.

g) Subject's story about a 15 day dentence in the
Lyubyanka because of the venergal disease incident suggests
that this may have been inserted in his legend to cover slips

. stemming from long prison experience, and possibly alse to :

belp him in passing the polygraph. i

h) Subject's earlier accounts about fighting at Tuapse, ©
runsing away from school, etc. also have several references, |
te prison that may be significant. te once referred to the —
