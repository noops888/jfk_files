Subject not only vas unable to

was "nachalnik razvedki;"

actually, of course, It should be

"nachalalk rarvedyvatelnogo upravleniya" of the ith fleet).

b)

Subject does not know the nane of his lundiate

Subject did not

understand why he had remembered it as Sovetsk, and said

that he had never been in the city of Bovetsk.

Subject was

also shown the Adninistrative-Territorial Divisions of the

UBSB, and conceded that there is no Primorskly Kray in the

Soviet Union except the one in tbe Far Bant.

Again, he bad

no explanation for his error.

Oddly, after initially con-

coding his error, fron time to tine Subject continued to

He was cut off.
