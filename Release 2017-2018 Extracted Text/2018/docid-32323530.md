Referenced Bureau letter to Miami 2/3/64 referred

DAVIS, JRo, at Miami, 1/15/64,

, wherein information was reported

originating with RENE SIERRA, as furnished to CIA, to the

effect that SIERRA participated in two boat trips to Cuba.

On the second trip, the mission failed because (FNU) MOLINA

took a boat radio and called RAUL CASTRO, informing - CASTRO

the Cuban cost sion, when they were about tile e

the Cuban coast.

as indicated in this report, (INU) MOLINA has been

identified with the subject of this inestigation.

The

Bureau may desire to consolidate its file on (FNU)MOLINA

with this case.

The file on (FNU) MOLINA in the Miami

Office (105-8604) is being consolidated.

This report contains information indicating

subject was probably on the missing flight with ALEXANDER

IRWIN RORKE, JR. (subject of Bufile 97-4623), and GEOFFREY

SULLIVAN, and is dead.

It is deemed advisable, however,

that further investigation be conducted conceming subject,

in an effort to substantiate his demise.

In view of

subject's probable demise, investigation will be primarily

centered around substantiating this, rather than the pro-CASTRO

allegations. If it is determined the subject is alive, of

course, investigation will then be conducted concerning the

pro-CASTRO allegations regarding subject.
