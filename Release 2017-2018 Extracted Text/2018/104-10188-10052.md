LIENVOY was. estimated at 357,000 in our recent FY 1968

If you will be necding replacements for equipment

for the LP, would 1t be possible to reallocate funds previously

budgeted for LISALAD and for "purchase of information" to cover

the

cost of such procurement?

3.

Headquarters appreciates the carefully detailed renovale

which you prepare on LIENVOY becauge they give such a good picture of

what the project produces.

Could you also include in the current

renewal a brief description of the center and the equipment ond

how the management of the daily routine is shared betveen AREMART

PURPOSE: Project supports a joint CIA-Moxican Govurnment telephone

tap unit and a non-official liaison relationship with

PROGRESS: During the past year covered a total of 30 telcphone linea :

simultancously providing 8, 6tt reels of raw take. Of the 30

lines, at least 15 of them are exclusively for Station targets

and the remaining targets are chosen by the Mexican authoritieg.:

but are usually of interest to the Station. Station targels include

the Cuban Embassy, the Soviet Embassy, Czech Embassy,

Polish Embassy and the New China News Agency.

F'I/INT files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced

during the review period. This production, although unavoidably

uneven in quality and coverage, included a considerable amount

of useful information relevant to priority nocds of the community.

LIENVOY coverage of Cuban and Soviet installationg has becn

of particular usefulness as a check on Station operations. A

get of voice samples of Soviot officials has been collected which

assists the identification, of unidentified speakers elsewhere.

23 February 1967

Project LIENVOY -- Renewal Period 1 February 1037 - 31 January 1963

Comments and Recommendations (To be forwarded to the Division)

1. Our files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced wholly

or in part by LIENVOY and disseminated in the period 1 February 1200 - 31.

January 1907.

Over half of this production (60 reports) dealt with pians and

activities of Mexican Communists and other leftiste. Included were 17

reports which provided useful information on the unrest at the National

Autonomous University. (UNAVi) and other universities. As our recent

study of reporting on Mexico indicates, student unrest has been a subject

of high interest to the community. Also included were 13 dissemistions

which contributed to the station's coverage, highly praised by all customers,

of leftist activities in connection with President Johnson's visit. The oiher

30 reports in this group, primarily concorning the ECM, MUN, and PPS,

varied considerably in quality but in general appeared to be oi moderate

value in relation to customer needs.

2. The disseminated production from forsign Communist installations

was relatively meager. There were 9 reports on relations with the soviets,

mostly on cultural programs; 3 reports on commercial negotiations with

Czechoslovakia and Poland; 7 reports concerned with Cuba; and & reports

on Chicom (NCNA) activities in Mexico.

With the possible exception ot

information on Vexican-Bloc trade -- a subject of inuch interest to ORR --

the LIENVOY coverage of official Communist installations did not provide

positive intelligence of any great significance. Motably lacking was iniorma

tion on ioreign subversive efforts against Mexico, for which customers lave

expressed an urgent need.

3. The rest of the production for the perio included the follewing:

9 reports concerning Guatemalan exile activity, nich appeared to te of

value; 9 reports on activities of the press secretary of the Presidencia which

contributed to covcrage of the government's pians and activities... at area

on which the community has a high priority need for information; and one

report concerning initiatives for a Vietnamese peace which was disseminated

as an Intelligence Information Special Report to the Director.

There were

also 4 reports on right-wing Sinarchist activity, a subject of relatively

little interest to customers.

.. In summary, the positive intelligence production as a wiole,

amo: ot useful intoriation sievant to priority needs of the cominunity.

While this disseminata: produs: in itself would hardly justify the total cost

of the project,

we assume that a substantial portion oi the cost is warranted

Renewal of the LIENVOY Project

l....-

Renewal is requested of the LIENVOY Project

for the period 1 February

1967

through 31 January

1968

for a total of $57,100, with $22,170 for FY

1967

and $34,630 for FY

1968.

The LIENVOY Project

was

included in the 1967 Operational Program for-

$50,000.

The additional funds roqulred for FY

1967 are

avallable vithin Wi Division.

2.

The LIENVOY Project covers both access to

high lovel Mextcan Government officials,

7 and a joint telephone tap operation

The phone taps produce FI, CE, and operational

support information.

According to

Headquarters

records, during the period 1 February through 31

December 1966, LIENVOY was the source of ninety-eight

positive intelligence reports, seventy-nine of which

were disseminated.

These reports covered the follow

ing general subject categories:

Soviet Embassy

activities in Mexico,

Mexican Communist Party activi

ties, Communist front activities,

the activities of

the Chicom representatives in Mexico, and the

activities

of various

extremist groups.

Included in

this reporting was that prior

to and during President

Johnson's trip

to Mexico City in April 1966.

The

Station's reporting on this trip, which included

LENVOY, was highly praised by the customers.

LIENVOY

also frovided some good coverage during

the trouble

at the Natlonal Autonomous

University (UNAM) in the

spring and useful information during disturbances at

some of the other universities.

The romainder of the

LIENVOY coverage couid be considered

of medium-level

interest and value.

LIENTOY coverage, particularly of the Cuban

and

Soviet installations, was useful as a check on

the Station's operations.

It furnished information

on doublo agents diroctod against the soviets, for

instance,: and on several agents in contact with the

Cuban Embassy. LIENVOY also identified leads into

the

sone of whom have since been recruited

(e.g. LIROAN and the LIROBBIN's)

Another oxample of the

usefulness of LIENTOY Is the

set of voice sauples of Soviet officials

which has.

been collected and

which permits the identification

of unidentified speakers on other coverage. For

examplc,

recently in LIFEAT a man speaking with

Suzic PIERRE Charles, i Haitian Communist, was

Identified as Vladinir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH (KGB) .

LIENVOY is also che principal source of intormation

on the travel of Soviets within Mexico and abroad.

The Station has a standing requirement for informing

the Office of the logal Attache in Mexico of all

travel performed by Soviet officials within the

Republic of Mexico, and LIENVOY helps the Station

to fulfill this request.

A. CURRENT OLUECTIVES

The LIENVOY Project provideo for a joint KULARK-Mcrican Government uponcored

telephone tap unit and for a non-officlal liaison relatlonuhip with acceus to

the highest ranking government officials of lexico.

The Lap unit provides

direct cupport necessary to cover targets and operntional progrars levied on the.

This Project also produces positive intelligence.

B. CHANGES

The LIENVOY Project vas crented in late 1958 and put into operation in

carly 1959 at the request of LITENSOR who appointed LIELEGANT so his special

assistant to work with willard C. CURTIS in the supervialon and adminintration of

the project.

In mid-IDo 1t become coldent that LIFAMA would replace LIFENSOR In

(LIRAMA was then LITIiO-2 and: a clandestine llalson contact with

Willard C. CURTIS under the LITEMPO Project but was not knowledgeable of the

CURTIS/LIELEGAT/LITENSOR reladlonuhly in Project. LIFNVOY.) On 10 August 1964

LIRAMA (LITEMPO-2) nuked CUNIIS and LIELENNI for a conference (reported to Read-

quarters in MEXI-0521 dated 10 August 1964).

At thie meeting, LIRAMA novised that

LITENSOR had briefed him on sie LILIVOX Project In detall and that 1t should be

continued with the same persennel and unner of operation.

product:.

"The LIENVOY production on the Cuban Embassy traffic In

Mexico. City hes been one of the basic elements cortributing to the

success of the AMHOD operatior, alrected agains: the tUIS for CA

purposes.

Tre LIENVOY operation has been of value in two general

senses:

The documentary material derived from the texts has

forned

core. of the

basis for reconstruction of historical facts

needed for the operation.

b.

The day to day coverage has enabled

thie case officer on the AMROD operatior to

sense the climate inside

the target, to kcep track of the novenents of key opposition personnel,

to check on the bona fides oi certain esents, to check the wors of:

others for veracity and to live monitor portions of the reactions

to the AIROD operation itsclf.

Beire able to kcep track of the

chifts and movements of the opposition and their personal relations

has been of vital importance to this operation.

On two occasiors

the AMROD Case Officer also used the LIEVOY base as his command

post when engineering personal contacts between & KUBARK staffer

and the opposition.

This type of close support did much: to icteruine

the success of those meetings and contributed grently to the success

of the operation.

boards for the AMROD operation end are regularly forwarded to me at

Headquarters."

The six lines above are fullj transcribed by LEIVOY transcribers

and delivered by ARENARI to Ritas each morning.

1n the intercept center chronological files. LIRA does not read

these transcripts unless some sinificant Item appears in

to the tape.

The coverage of this target also jields a good picture of duily

nctivities,

residences, personal hebits and weaknesses of Cubun

official personnel in Mexico.

This Is used by Suntion Case Officers

in selection of corgete for recmilthent and in checking on ectivities
