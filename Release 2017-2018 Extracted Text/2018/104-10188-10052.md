RiTiON RroviRiO - RUNTIME

7 ‘Le. Project LIENVOY 1s due for renewal on 1 February 1968.
Would you please let’us have a renewal request by 1 January 1968.

2, LIENVOY was. estimated at $57,000. in our recent FY 1968
program .exercise,so we must ask that you stay within this figure
‘{n'the renewal.- If you will be necding replacements for equipment
for the LP, would it be possible to reallocate funds previously
budgeted for LISALAD and for “purchase of information" to cover

the cost of such procurement?..

|. 3. ‘Headquarters appreciates the carefully detailed renewals
which you prepare on LIENVOY because they give such a good picture of
what the project produces. Could you-also include in the current
renewal'a brief description of the center and the equipment and
how the management of the daily routine is shared between AREHART

and bis Mexican colleagues?

MEMORANDUM, FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
“SUBJECT - : Renewal of the LIENVOY Project

13... Renéwal is requested of the LIENVOY Project
for the period 1 February 1967 through 31 January
1968 for a total of $57,100, with $22,470 for FY
1967 and $34,630 for FY 1968, The LIENVOY Project
was included in the 1967 Operational Program for_
$50,000, The additional funds required for FY
1967 are available within WH Division,

2, The LIENVOY Project covers both access to
high level Mexican Government officials,

{and a joint telephone tap operation

3, The phone taps produce FI, CE, and operational
support information. According to Headquarters
records, during the period 1 February through 31
December 1966, LIENVOY was the source of ninety-eight
positive intelligence reports, seventy-nine of which
were disseminated. These reports covered the follow-
ing general Subject categories: Soviet Embassy
activities in Mexico,’ Mexican Communist Party activi-
ties, Communist front activities, the activities of
the Chicom representatives in Mexico, and the
activities of various extremist groups. Included in
this reporting was that prior te and during President
Johnson's trip to Mexico City in April 1966, The
Station's reporting on this trip, which included
LIENYOY, was highly praised by the customers, LIENVOY
also provided some good coverage during the trouble
at the National Autonomous University (UN, in the
spring and useful information during disturbances at
some of the other universities. The remainder of the
LIENVOY coverage couid be considered of medium-level
interest and value.” During the same period, LIENVOY



ies SECRET

provided information for ten CE disseminations to
the FBI ‘on Americans in contact with the Sovict
and Cuban Embassies in Mexico.

4. " LIENVOY. coverage, particularly of the Cuban
‘and Sovict installations, was useful as a check on
the Station's operations, It furnished information
rected against the Soviets, for
al agents in contact with the
Cuban Efbassy, YOY also identificd leads into
the Soviets, some of whom have since been recruited
as access agents. (e.g. LIROAN and the LIROBBIN's)
Another example of the usefulness of LIENVOY is the
set of voice sauples of Soviet officials which has
been collected and which permits the identification
of unidentified speakers on other coverage, For
-example, recentiy in LIFEAT a man speaking with
Suzic PIERRE Charles, a Haitian Communist, was
identified as Vladimir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH (KGB).
LIENVOY is also ‘the principal source of information
on the “travel of Soviets within Mexico and abroad.
The. Station has a standing requirement for informing
the Office of the’Legat Attache in Mexico of all
“travel performed by Soviet officials within the
Republic of Mexico, and LIENVOY helps the Station

to fulfill this request.
5. LIFEAT. the unilateral telephone tap

operation, concentrates on individual Soviets, Cubans,
Communists, and Americans who are of special WOFACT

CE interest.

1959 at the request of LITENSOR who appointed LLELOGANT as his special
assistant to work with Willard C, CUPTIS in the supervision ond administration

‘ of the project. In mid-1964 it became evident that LIRAMA would replace

” LITENSOR in December 1964, (LIRAMA ‘vas then LITEMPO-2 and a clandestine

liaison contact with Willard C. CURTIS under the LITEMPO Project but was not
Inovledgeable of the CURPIS/LIELEGANT/LITENSOR relationship in Project

within one day of the conversation; however, if the caller happens

to be a U.S. citizen, the transcripts are prepared imncdiately which
frequently perwits the Station to arrange for unilateral surveillance and
identification of the persons involved. The Commercial Office coverage
provides informsticn on Cubsn Commercial activities in Mexico and
identification of firms doing business with Cuba. The Elena Vasquez
Gomez target was connected to support the censitive AMROD operation,

The six lines against the Cuban target are fully transcribed by LIENVOY
transcribers ani delivered by Arnold FP. AREHART to Robert % RIGGS

Permanently stationed.in Mexico (the larsest fore{gn embassr in Mexico

LIENVOY previde details cn the activities of most of these Scriets.

These Lines are:

The volume of trade between Mexico and the USSR still’
does not. justify a commercial staff of this size. The

<Mexico Station has had some success in running double

‘agents against these officers. LIENVOY provides a
helpful check cn these casea. The take from LIENVOY
also identifies intelligence officera as. escorts for

vho continue to travel between the USSR and. Mexico,
other on visits to Mexico orto and-from other latin

American countries. Once these groups arrive in Kezico,
their movements usually become known through LIENVGY.

As reported. previously, the Soviet information is transcribed by the
LIENVOY trenacribors in the: same way as the Cuban traffic except tuat
the reels aleo contain @ considerable volume of Russian language con-
vereations. This requires that the reels be picked up dally and do~
livered to an outside (unileteral) translator (Statf Azent Douxlas J.

data, thie source provides a valuatle check on access agents in contact
with Polish officials.’ Most of the leada to accoss agents in this
field have originated with the LIENVOY Project.

Se Communist China News Agency (NCNA), Until 4 November 1966 there

were three representatives of the Communint China News Agency in Mexico.
During the project year, LUENVOY covered this target as a parallel to

@ sensitive ‘audio operation. Cn 4 Novestor 19€6 the three nowspapermen
packed up and lert Mexico for-Havana, Cuba, closing down the{r house and
otfice in Mexice. A cold approach vas made prior te their departure,

by a Headquarters TiYer but was not successful.

. The Mexico Statica Case Officers responcible for established PI and
CI/CS programs continue to feel that LIENVOY makes a very necessary
intelligence support contribution. Tho facilities of this project,
due to centralized tapping and transcribing, continue to produce three
‘tines the voluze cf raw audio and finished intelligence as LIFZAT at
approximately che half the cost. As a sewi-official liaison tap
cperaticn, LIEXWY continues to Le able to place a tap on any phone
desired whereas LIFEAT as a unilateral operation, does not always have
imzediate access to a desired target, The continued success of Statlon
Mexico's operational program against the Cuban, Sovist and Soviet
Satellite instal}attons and personnel in Mexico {3 largely attributable
to the continous and thorough coverage of. these targets by this project.
Chief of Station, Mexico, recommends that the project be reneved for
another year as an essential collection and support operation for the

February 1966, after his. successful trip, LIRANA contacted Willard C,
“GUNTIG to expresa'his appreciation for thts briefing and comented that
“the briefing: vas exactly right on all countries,”

In March 1966 LIRAMA via LIENVOY=-2 aekea the Station fer assistance
in meattoring the activities of Victor AICO Galan who was subsequently
arrested and is being held by Maxican Goverment authorities. for

PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A. CURRENT: 01

The LIENVOY Project provides for a joint KUBARK-Mexican Government oponso}

The tap unit prov: rect

= - ror vargets and Operational programs levied on the
Mexico Station via the| Jas voll as opot requests from Hoadquarters and other
Stations. This project also produces considerable positive intelligence.

B. CHANGES
(1). Operational Mechanten

The LIENVOY Project vas created in late 1958 and put into operation
in early 1959 at the request of LITENSOR who appointed LIELBQANT as his spacial
ssslotent to work with Willani C. CURIIS in the supervision and administration .
of the project. In mid-1964 it vecame evident that LIRAMA vould replace
LITENSOR 1 Docowber 1964. (LIRAMA was then LITEMPO-2 and a clandestine Maison
contact with Willard C. CURTIS under the LITEMPO Project but waco not knowledgeable
of the CURTIS/LIELMGANT/LITENSOR relationahtp in Project LIEWOY.) On 10 Auguat
1964 LORMA wet vith CURTIS ani LIELWANE and advised them that LITENSOR had
briefed hia on the LIZNVOY Project in dotail and that it should be continued
with the same personnel and the samo manner of operation, Both LIELSGANT and
LIENVOY-2 wero given nominal positions on LIRAMA‘'a ataff with cover for daily
contact with LIRAMA. Government credentials were also provided for Arnold Fs
Arebart (Staff Agent) ae well as the local agents working in the LP. During the
past project year, the LP has remained in the same location. Inside the front
doorvay a credential, provided by LIRAMA, prohibits entry to anyone without
epeciel permtesion chtained frou LIRAMA’s office.

(2) Agents

There have been no changes in agent personnel during the past two
project years; however, for information of’ reviowing officials not famtliar vith
this project, there is enclosed as Attachment-1, a chart Listing current’ LIENVOY
targets as well au the functions of each agent, Staff Agent Arnold F. Arehart
has been with the project for six years. His duties inside the LP are to aititain
the technical equipment and protect KUBANK interest by observing activities of
local agents and preventing negligent bruakage or loss from theft. There has
been no major mchanical breakdown during the past project year. Arehart also
is there to see that KUBARK gots copies of all transcripts ani gets reels on any

and all converretions.
ION

C. INTELLIGENCE PRO!
The Chief of Station Mexico considers the LIENVOY project as a valuable source



-2-

for pooitive intellisence on Mexican political figures on Communism and on

--activities of foreisn Communists in Mexico or transitting Mexico. In addition

this project assists in satiofying the Station's support requirements for
operational data and in providing access to the highest echelons of the Mexican

Government.

(1). FI information. From 1 January 1965 through 31 Deceuber 1965
thie project was the source of 176 positive reports. (Of the 641 positive reports
sent by the Mexico Station to Headquarters between 1 Jamuery and 31 December 1965,

(2) CI/cE information. In addition to the general subject categories of
FI interest, the LIENVOY Project continues to fulfill a standing requirement to
provide CI/CE data on the following selected targets:

Cuban Embassy - six lines
Soviet Bnbassy - five lines

Chinese Communist News Agency (NCNA) - one line
Czech Embassy - two lines

Polish Brbassy - two lines

Several Mexican Ccamuniate

Of the above coverage, neither the Czech nor the Polish Bubessy targets are*
Listed a3 a priority in the litest Related Mission Directive. They are covered
for possible leads into the Soviet Embassy intalligence activity.

D. EFFECTIVRESS

(1) During the past year (1 January 1965 through December 1965) the LIENVOY
Project covered a total of 30 (thirty) targets oimiltaneously vhich provided
§,54L reale of ray take. This waa processed into 19,960 pages of transcripts

f£ this amount actual count by LIENVOY processors was 14,460 pages, an estimate
by the outeide Czech translator was 1,500 pages, the Russian translator 2,000
Pages, and the Polish translator 1,000), Enclosed as attachment mmber 2 te the

oo While the above lines’ were covered at various times during the pest project.
; year, the LIENVOY.intercept center has the capability of connecting machines to
any line which las been covered in.the past since once a tap is made running the

line into the center, it stays there after the machines have been put on other

targets.

The reels from the above targets are not transcribed completely, LIENVOY
monitors extract significant conversations and include then in a daily “resumen”,
the original of which is read daily by LIRAMA and a copy of which io delivered
each morning to the Mexico Station. The reels ure retained for ubout ten days
for fuller transcripts 1f requested by LIRAMA or vy the Mexico Station. The
"resumen" is typed in four copies at the end of each day (covering conversations
Which occurred that day), (n the following morning by 0800 hours, one copy 16

The Commercial Office

The Consulate

Elena Vasquez Gouez

The Chancery and Consulate lines regularly identify foreigners in
Mexico who contact the Cuban Embassy. Reels are usually transcribed
within one day of the conversation; however, if the caller happens

to be a U.S. citizen, the transcr:pta are prepared immediately which
frequently permits the Station to arrange for unilateral surveillance
and identification of the persons involved. The Coumercial Office
coverage provides information on Cuban Coumercial activities in Mexico
and identification of firms doing tusiness with Cuba.



The Elena Vasquez Gonez target was covnected to support the sensitive
AMROD operation. Tho AMROD Headquarters Case Officer, Thomas G. ‘URQUHART
(ps) viaits Mexico once a month on teaporary duty in connection with this
operation, His coments on this project aret

"The LIENVOY Projéct continued through 1965 to be of. great importance

te the conduct of thé. AMROD and certain related Operations, It enabled
ease officers ‘to’ know vhich of the PHAUNEN target personalities vere

in town, who their’cantact’s were and gave an insight into the operational
‘gituation that affected AMROD, ‘Tne LICLOVE-1 phase of thie operation
was.of particular value in giving an inaide Muly documentary view of
opposition ‘efforts to counter certain phases of the AMROD operation

and helped planning the tactical moves in the LICLOV: operation itself.
LIENWVOY, thus bas contributed materially to our handling of the tactical
phases of’ an iaportant operation ant has given valuable intelligence
information concerning various phases thereof."

‘The six lines against the Cuben target are fully transcribed by LIENVOY
transcribers and delivered by Arnold F, ARSRART to Robert B. RIGGS each
morning, Lengthy conversations sonotimes require additional time for
transcription, A carbon copy of each transcription is pouched weekly
to Headquarters for use of WH/C, The original is retained by the Mexico
Station, .A thind copy ie retained in the intercept center chronological
files. LIRAMA does not read these transcripts unless some significant
item appears in the "resumen" which causes hia to ask to see a fuller
trenscript or to listen to the tape.

Coverage.of the Cuban Embassy target yields a good picture of daily
“activities, residences, personal habite and weaknesses of Cuban official
personnel in Mexico, This is used by Station Case Officers in selection
of targets for recruitment and in checking on activities of agents
already recruited who. are working inside the target or who are in contact
with Cuban officials.

2. Soviet Hzbassy. The Soviet Government has over fifty officials
permanently stationed in Mexico (the largest foreign embassy except for
the U.S.). MTairty-five of these Soviets (70 percent of the staff) are
known or suspect intelligence officers, The five lines under LIENVOY
provide details on the activities of aost of these Soviets, These lines

are:

15 60 55 Soviet Consulate and Chancery. This line is used by fifteen
known or suspect KQB officers. It 1s also used by foreimers
in Mexico attempting to aake contact with the Soviets. When
the contacts suggest clamlestine meetings, the Station arranges
for unilateral surveillance and has identified many cotacts in
this aanner. :

15 61 55° Soviet Chancery. This line is used orimarily by the Asbassador
and provides wore information on protocol contacts’ than leads of
intelligence interest. Hovever, it gives the Station a picture
of the personalities being cultivated by Soviet diplomats and of



Mexicans who are seeking contact with the Soviets.

15 61 Of Soviet Commercial Office. Five (5) known or suspect GRU
officers use this number. Thay are Military inteliisence
officers using Comercial Office cover and in some instances
actually performing coumercial functions or traie cegotiations.
‘The volume of trade between Mexico and the USSR dzes not
justify a Comercial Office staff of ten (10) Soviets. The
Mexico Station has had seme success in running dcxtle agents
against thede GHU officers, LIENVOY provides a he-pful check
on these operations. The take from LIMNVOY also iientifies

"0 ‘thé’ GRU officers aa escorts for trade, scientific, comercial
and tourist delezations who continue to travel between the USSR
and Mexico, either on visits to Mexico or to ant ‘nu other
Latin American countries. Once these groups arrive in Mexico,
their itineraries usually become available. LIENVCY.

15 12 64 Soviet Films Office. This leads into the residence and office

. of the distributor for Soviet Commercial Films in Mexico who is
@ suspect intelligence officer. There have been s oumber of calla
suggesting clandestine contact with Central Americans but the
Station has not yet deen auccessful in identifying the callers,

15 69 87 Soviet Military Attache. This contimes to be the least
productive of the coverage in terms of volume bec! the
Soviet Military officers either wili oot answer tie telephone or
spend. very iittle time where it rings. It is usvally tae
number called by U.8. AWOL servicemen trying to cake contact
with the Soviets, and by other Asericans who for coe reason
or another want to work for the Soviets or go to the USSR.
There are three (4) GRU colonels aml six (6) civiiian ORU
officers who use thia line,

Tha Sovict information ts transeMbed by the LIDVOS tramerivers in tue
same way as the Cuban traffic except that the reels also contain a considerable
volume of Russian language conversations, This requires that the crels be
picked up daily and delivered tc an outside (unilateral) translaticn (Staff
Agent Douglas J. FIENGLASS) vno translates the Russian conversaticcs into
Mglish. From these transcrigts IL ts apparent that the Soviets ary sot avare
that their conversations in Russien are being overheard and undersiol. These
daily exchanges between the Soviets and their wives (who also werk in the Embassy)
provide a good picture of personal habits, grievances, aarriage reiationehips,

and weaknesses of targets of interest to KUBARK.

“3. Czech Bnuassy. Two lines in the Chancery (45 30 92 and 45 50 12) ere
covered by LIENVOY, Reels from these targets are delivered daily ty ARSUAKT
to RIGGS wo delivers tuem to the BE Case Officer who arranges for transcription

and translations to be done by David B. SCHLAOHTER, field contract agent.
‘Thies agent also prepares a monthly summary of information on the eztivities

gardifg tha relationships between various Polish officials. LIENVOY also
provides a'very valuable check on varicun access agente who are in contact
With Polish offfciale, Practically all leads to access agents in this field

5. Courmnist China Nevs Agency (NCNA). Three representatives of the
Gommniet China News Agency sre in Mexico, Ad a revult of a briefing of
LIRAMA by Willtard C, CURTIS on 18. December 1964, LIRAMA requested coverage
ef the line vilich goes into a tuilding used by these Chinese as a combination
residence and office. This: {afcrmation haa been useful for travel data,
identification of contacts ef the Chinvsu Conmunists in Mexico and some
packsround on the threa Cninese news representatives. Using leads from this
ence, several unsuccessfut efforts have baen made to plece a Chinese
Epeaker in touch with one of the three Chineve nevamen to make @ cold approach
(during international travel frva Mexico to Lenton).

Ths Mexico Station Case Ufficers responsible for established FI and
CI/cs programs feel that LYENVOY has mad a very necessary Intelligence
sort contribution. The ixtilities of! thio project, duo to centralized
tapping and transcribing, sccriaue to produce three tines the volume of
av audio and finished inteliisence ae LIFEAT at approxiaately one half the
cost. Ad a seat-official ita'son tap operation, LIENVOY centinuea to be able
to place a tap on any phone desired whereas LIFEAT, ea a untlateral operation,
dyes not alvaya have immediate access to a desired target. The continued
success of Station Naxtco's crerational program against the Cuban, Soviet and
Soviet Satellite installations and personnel in Mexico is largely atéributable
zo the continuous ani thoroush coverage of these targets by thts project.

et with LIRAMA on 1 February 1965 to give hia a briefing on the
political oftuation in Central Anerica ani to provide technical
guidance in the selecticn of sensitive inks for LIRAMA use,

At the request of Willard C..CURTIS, LIRANA instructed a high official
in the talephone company on 2 February 1965 to make available unlisted
telephone numbers for two of hio agents to copy. The tvo agente wore
LIENVOY agents from the LP who had been instructed in the use of

@ Gintature camera. Headquarters subsequently provided the Maxico
Station with a reverse Listing of ‘these numbers.

In March: 1965 Willard C, CURTIS visited LIRANA to Giscusa a
Posaible Mexican Government PNO operation against an official of the
Soviet. Bubassy in Mexico vho was known by the Mexico Station to be
conducting espionage operations involving a Kexican citizen.

In early May LIRAMA asked via LIELNGANT for a physical. security
Specialist to conduct a survey of LIRAMA offices and make
recounendationa for improvement of the security of these. preatoes.
Headquarters provided the services of Clarence @, PANKNIN (ps) on
TOY for tho pertod 16 May - 2 June 1965, As a resuit of this survey,
ani at the request of LIRAMA, threo LIRAXA bodyguards were sent to

PBPRINS for special training.

In late May 1965 the Mexico Station passed nanea of 14 Chinose
Comwmnist basketball playera to LIRAMA via LISLAGANE and asked that
these players be denied visas to enter Mexico, AG a result,

LITEMPO-S (acting on instructions from LIRANA) dented them vises to

transit Mexico.

At the request of LIRAMA, Headquartera provided special telephones for
the five lines in LIRAMA's private offices,

At the request of Willant C, CURTIS to LIRAMA, two agenta under the
LIFIRS Project were given especial credentials in July 1955 vhich
docurented thea as being on assignment from LIRAMA's offices.
Tnese credentials give these agents access to important travel
control data from the international airport.

In Septender 1965 two representatives of KURIGE visited Mexico and
troined LIRAMA in the use of a highly sensitive writing medium.

Beginning on 1 September 1965, Philip G, NUPAIT (pa), KUBARK
specialist, spent ninety days in Mexico training LIRAMA's Security
Forces.

In December 1965 LIRAMA asked for a XUBARK briefing on the political

for FY 1965 and $28,458 for FY 1966, These figures differ from those
subattted by the Gtation in reference because we transferred money for
the Christmas bonus from the FY 1965 column fo FY 1966 (see page 10 of
Project Renewal Request).

“2, The rensval request prepared ty the Station was excellent and

fifteen were exclusively for-CIA. The top CE targets
are the Soviets, Cubans, Satellites and Chicoms. Through
this coverage we have learned of several attempts of U.S.
eitizens te contact the Soviet Embassy or the Cuban
Embassy. Costa Rican concurrence to an approach by the
Czech Government to open an Embassy in Costa Rica wes
uncovered by LIENVOY. This move by the Czechs was
thwarted tnrougn tae efforts of the U.S. Department ef
State. While the greatest_value_of LIEMVOY lies in the
channel it provides] _ [the CI/CE
information it proviaes, the positive intelligence pro-
duction is greater than that of any other source of the

Station.

SUBJECT: Project LIENVOY Renewal

1, FI Staff recommends renewal of Project LIENVOY.

2. This operation has long been one of the best of
its kind, as a producer both of positive intelligence and
viable CI operational leads, We ‘are only beginning to
explore the exploitation of taps and other surveillance
activities as sources of sophisticated assessment data on
selected targets, An operation as effectively managed as
this should be readily adaptable to such exploitation,
Conversations with Branch officers give promise that this
added objective will be worked into this and other Wexico
station operations within the coming year.

4. LHENVeY is an eatrencty productive positive intellixence
project. . Its sain importance in the intelligence Cicld ts its
Capability of previding indications of the plans and the inten-
tions of the people who form its target. Perhaps one cf the
most important pieces of intelligence thered from ETESVOY
during 1964 occurred on 15 July 1964 when it was learned that
the Costa -Rican Government had concurred in an appr ach by
the Czech Governsent to open an hassy in Costa Rica, Ale
though it appeared recognition had already taken place, this
Agency through its high-level Governnent contacts and the
Department’ of Sate through the Anbassador to the Costa Ricen
President, were successful in thwarting this attempt by the
Czechs. In August the Foreign “Minister told our Ambassador

that Costa fica was not considering diplomatic recognition
of Czechoslovakia.

5, The project's Limitations from the intelligence point
of view are twofold: (1) the significance of fraguentary con-
versations is not always apparent, and (2) telephone Lines do
hot accept follow-up requivenents. According to Headquarters
records, production figures in 1964 were as follew:

LLENVOY taps Totai Poucied Reports + 150
Kot Disseninated - 49
Total Cabled Heports + 50

The subjects ef these reports were on Cuban activities in Mexico
and developments in Cuba; Coruunist and leftist personalitics
in Mexico; Soviet and Satellite activiti in Mexico. Reports
originating from agents under the project are a fellows:

7. while the greatest value of the LIENVOY Project uae
doubtedly lies in the channel it provides to LIRAMA and the
CI/CE information it provides, the intelligence product is
also of value as evidenced by the fact it produces wore posi-
tive reports than any other source of the Mexica City Station.
It is hoped that the processing of the raw material can be
improved so that marginal reporting wiich resulted, in. the large
nunber of undisseminated reports will soon disappear, The
Ll Y tuke also provides a very important support mechanism
for checking on other reports received from independent sources,
and for foJlowing developments related to certain operational

PROJECT LIENVOY KKNEWAL

A. CURRENT OLVECTIVES

The LEENVOY Project provides for a joint KUEARK-Mcxtcan Government sponsored
telephone tap unit and for a non-official liaison relatlonship with access to
the highest ranking governzent officials of Mexico, The tap unit provides
dircct support neccessary to cover targets and operntional programs levied on the.
Mexico Station via the as vell 98 spot requests from Headquartera and other
Stations. Thilo Project also produces positive intelligence.

B. CHANGES

‘Te LIENVOY Project vas created in‘late 1958 and put into operation in
early 1959 at the request of LITHISOR who appointed LIELECANT as his apecial
assistant to work with Willard C. CURTIS in the supervision and adalnivtration of
the project, In mld-1964 it became evident that. LIRAMA would replace LITENSOR in
December 1964. (LIRAMA was then LITH4i0-2 and:a clandestine liateon contact with
Willard C, CUKTIS under the LITEMPO Project tut wos not knowledgeable of the
CURTIS/LIELEGANT/LITENSOR relatlonship in Project LIFMVOY,) On 10 August 196%
LIRAMA (LITEMPO-2) noked CURT{S and LIELEGANT for a conference (reported to Head
quarters in MEXI-0521 dated 10 August 1904), At thio meeting, LIRAMA advieed that
LITENSOR hod briefed him on the LIEMVOY Project in detail and that it should be
continued with the same perscnnel and wanner of operation, LIELEGANT and LISNVOY-2

(1) From 1 February 1964 through Decerter 19/4 (eleven months) the LIENVOY
Project covered a total of 40 (thirty) targets simultaneously which provided
T,HO2 reels of rav take. This was processed into 21,504 pages of tranocripte
(cf this amount actual count by LIENOY processors was 17,004 pages, an vetimate

fulfilled ty LISNVOY whieh during the pest project year covered the telephone
lines of <he Cuban Embassy, Soviet Hbassy, Czech Embassy, Polish Bnbassy, Yugoslav
Tubassy, asi cade preliminary installation for the Communist Chinese News Agency
(NCNA), Tere follows selected significant examples of the LIEWOY product fron
each of these targets with a Station appraisal of its effectiveness.

The six lines covered are:

1

Tre Aabassador's private telephone
She Chancery

The Chencery

Tee Commercial Office

Te Consulate

na Vasquez Gomez

The Chencery an? Consulate lines regularly identify foreigners in
Nexico who contest the Cuben Embassy. Expeditious Procegsing or
She transéripts Zrequently permits the Station to arrange ror
uallateral surveillance ard identification of other contacts, The
Comercial Office Soverage provides information on Cuban Commercial
activities in Mexico and identification of firms dealing with Cuba,

The Elena Vascuez Gomez target has béen of interest in connection
with the AMROD operetion, The AMROD Keadquarters Case Officer, Thomas



G. URQUHART (ps), presently in Mexico on terporary duty has

provided’ the Station vith the rolloving evaluation of the LIENVOY
Product: "The LIENVOY production on the Cuban Bubassy traffic in
Mexico.City hes been one of the basic elements ccutributing to the
success of the AMKOD operation, directed ageins: the GUIS for CA
purposes. Tre LIENVOY operation has been of value in two general
senses: a. The Cocutentary raterial derived from the texts has
formed some of the basis for reconstruction of historical facts
needed for the operation. b, The dey to day coverage has enabled
the case officer on the AMROD operation to cense the climate inside
the target, to keep track of the movenents of key opposition personnel,
to check on.the bona fides of certain exents, to check the work of
others for veracity and to live monitor porticns of the reactions

to the AMROD operation itself, Beirg able to keep track of the
ehifts and movements of the opposition and their personal relations
has been of vital importance to tiis operation. On two occasions
the AMROD Case Officer also used the LIZVOY base as his command
post when engineering personal contacts between o KUBARK staffer

‘and the opposition. This type of close support did muck to determine
the success of those meetings and contributed grently to the success
of the operation, These transcripts provide one of the best sounding
boards for the AMROD operation end are regularly forwarded to me at
Headquarters.”

The six lines shove are fully transcribed ty LIEWVOY transertbers
and delivered by AREHART to RIGGS each morning. Lenythy conversa-
tions sometimes require an additione. day for transcription. A
carbon copy is pouched weekly to Heedquarters for WH/SA use, ‘The
original is retained by the Mexico Station, A third copy te retained
in the intercept center chronological files. LIRAMA does not read
these transcripts unless sose sigmificant Ltem appears in the
"resusen" which causes him to ask for a fuller transcript or Usten
to the tape,

The coverage of this target also yields a good picture of duily
activities, residences, personal habits and weaknesses of Cuban
offictal personnel in Mexico, Tals Ls used by Station Case Officers
in selection of targets for recruitment end tn checking on activities
of agents already recruited and either working Tor or in contect
with Rrbassy officials. 3 ae

2, Soviet Eubassy. The Soviet Government, has over fifty officials
permanently stationed in Mexico (the largost foretgn embassy except
for the U.S.), Tuirty-four of these Soviets (aimost 70 percent of
the steff) are known or suspect intelligence officers. The five
lines under LIENVOY provide details on the activities of most of
these Séviets, The lines aret i



15°68.'55 Sovfet Consulate and Chancery. “This line is used by
fisteen (15) known or suspect KGB ofvicers, It ts also
used by foreigners in, Mexico attezpting to make contact with
the Soviets. When contacts suggest clandcotine meetings, the
Station arranges for unilateral curveillance and has had
sone success in identifying contacts,

15 61 55; Soviet Chancery, This line is used primarily by the Ambassador
and provides nore information on protocol contacts than leads
of intelligence interest, However, it gives tne Station a
picture of the personalities being cultivated by Soviet
diplomats and of Mexicans who are seeking contacts vith the
Soviets.

15 G1 07 Soviet Comercial Office, Four (lb) known or ouspect GRU
officers use this number. They are Military intelligence
officers using Comercial Office cover and in sume instances
actually perform comercial functions of trade negotiations
but the volume of trade between Mexico and the USSR does
not justify a Comercial Office staff of eight (8) Sovieta.
This produces some information useful to check on double
agent operations run by the Station against the GRU officers,
In addition, the LIEMVOY product usually Identifies the
GRU officers as escorts for trade, scientific, commercial,
and tourist delegations who now are conatently on trips
from the USSR to Mextco. LIFNVOY also provides details of
the itineraries of these groups once they arrive in Mexico,

15 12 Gi Soviet Films Office. This leads into the residence and
office of Viatintr Petrovich OBRUBOV, a suspect GRU officer,
who distributes Soviet Commercial films in Mexico. Tnere
have been several calls from what appear to be Central,
Americans but the Station has not been successful in identify=
ing the callers or determining the nature of the calls,

15 69 87 Soviet Military Attache. This is the least productive of
the coverage sisnly because the Soviet Military officers
either won't answer the telephone or spend very little time
where it rings, Nevertheless, U.S. AWOL servicemen try
this number to make contect.' There are three GRU colonels
end six (6) ctvillan GRU officers who use this line.

The Soviet information is transeribed by the LIFNVOY transcribers in
the same vay as the Cutan traffic except that the transcripts are
delivered datiy vith the reels from which an outside translator
(Douglas J, FEINGLASS) transcrites the Russian conversations {nto
English. These Russian comversations are of considerable value end
it is npparent that the Soviets ere not aware that these conversations
are being overheard en understood, There have been conversations
tdentifying code room personnel; one conversation between two Soviet
children revesled the entire layout of the Soviet Commercial Office;
personality clashes and grievances arc olso aired.
