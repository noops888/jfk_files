SUBIECI® Lyle STUART

Reference is made to your megorandus dated J June 1964,
in vhich you provided thig office with several questions you
sjehed to have pagsed to lies Viola June COBB regarding
Lyle STUART. Tasre foliovs the information provided by
Mins ferme fo anewew ta vour inquiry!

1. Regarding Lyle STUART, Juan Jose ANEVALO, and
Antikommisra en Asesica Latina:

Eariy in the spring of 1962, in Hezico, AREVALO told
me that STULET wes prodding him about petting another of his
books translated, to take advantage of the publicity around
Tro Shark oni the Sardines. Y vas already tar beyond
axing tered with Si-ait ond therefore Jeclined to have
hing further to do with bim, About three months ister,
RaEVALO told me that STUART waa goiag to publisa
Antixosunisao en Amomica Lniiss and that @ young Americaa
Sicdent, married to a Hexicau, Angela dellt SATB ALROCHA
(eo nad written Arevalo, }: ior contemporanco, puslished i
by Coat] Amis, 1968, financed Als cri Revolucionario
de El Satvacor) was doing tae tranplation anto English.

Early in 1983, ARKVALO toid mo Shut the translation bada't
been satisfactory and therefore STUAIT had obtained a re
translation, by Charleton BEALS.

When STUART was here in Mexico im June, he tole
br. OSDCUEDA that he was very happy spout the way the book
5 was selling. ‘

Yrasmuch as STUART han paid AREVALO ealy 10 por cent
of moneys received by STUART on the Shark and the Sardiues
gales (in contrast with some book ¢

cts im which the author

Seceives W per cent of tie money represented by nunber of ae
copies fold sultiplied by tne retatl sales price) i vould
Scouse he 16 uo more gencrous Sith Ant tsomuntame. i

i _ OS LORY

“Ris wife

+ of course. i

-o

I knov of no affiliations of STUART with foreign
political parties of government. Hig attempts to get close
to Fidel CASTRO in 1960 were rotivated by 2 desire to expioit
the journalistic advantages of an interview. His original :
interest in The Shark and the Sardines was apparently !
potivated by money-paking interests and by the hope that
he might spark a sensation ~ exactly what be did mansye to
do with his outrageous advertising. He eeened to caiculate
that there might be libel suits possible ogainat the firms
and the neespapera he could provoke to attack him.

The original contract of AREVALO with STUART was
superseded by another in Novenber of 1961, granting STUART
certain rights with regard to other foreign language edittons
of The Shark and the Sardines and, I believe, establishing
sect ENTE Sena beeen fieet antian aa anther ARRVALO booka

translated into English.

Information about STUART's dealings with AREVALO
and whatever others, could be obtained (with cuiie) fron v
Eileen BRANT, who vas juis editor at the tine of the first
contact with AREVALO, She subsequently broke with him
because of deep and bitter resentaent against hia, then
returned not too long age to collaborate vith him. She is

sister. She is certainly working with him now .

cniy because he finally offered her a little better pay. For~
her to have changed her mind about him would be alnost i
impossible, I believe, in view of the long history of incidents
that had brought her to have contenpt for hin, at the tine
I knew her.ia 1961. She knows his operation inside-out.
In order te get infernation from her, it would be absolutely
necessary to approach her from some angle that vould give 3
no hint of government investigation. Bhe is very gregarious. *
he is a fortyish mediumattractive, lonely, New York single
woman (unless her status has changed since 1 knew her). If
contacted by eomebody she would assume to be a writer, and
who vould be a bit friendly with her and aee her off-hours, |
whe vould probably talk freely about STUART, But she is é
quite clever and rather worldly in some respects, So that must
be kept in mind in case she is contacted. SHB HAS A VERY H
DEEP AND LONGTIME NEGATIVE ‘ATTITUDE, TOWARD ALL GOVEBNAGNT
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN IXVESTIGATION. She wee active in
Liberal activitics in Chicago, and if I renenber correctly,
elthough phe is certaialy not communist, she consi¢ered beraelt
a little jeopardised by the lc Carthy pertod. } i

2. Regarding Lyle STUART, Dr. Baul CARCURD, Eertolone
CosTA Amic, and Hario BOTEFOPTE Toledo?

Dr. OSEGUEDA apparently hag had 8 secret Ichging to
get something of his ows printed in English. He eeized upon
the opportunity of commenting ASALS' introduction to
Antixoauniszo in order to write to STUART this spricg.
SHURE wrote very cordially pack to OSEGUZD4, boping to meot
bim op & trip to Hexico in dune. When OSEGEDS confessed to :
ne his’ correspondence with STUART, he sought to make me Bee : +
it as en stteapt to speak with STUART about the royaltice
STUART has never paid Be.

When Dr. OGEGUEDA finally eid see TUART here in id
Hexico during the book congress in Juns, he only very t
tinidly end very, very briefly touched upon the royalty _t
araniem, and indeed went to ® er at deal of trouble to Gerve H
BYUAKT by introqucamg sor: ow Seats fats oat te Marta ae
HOETEVORTE Toledo. (STUART hod expressed interest 13
getting im touch with Gone publishers and writers.) c@azovEDA
entied about, taking OBLGUEDA and WOXTEFORTE Toledo te lusch t
tein BTUART, even managed to get the LONTEFGRTE Toledos to Sete
invite STUART to dinner at their apartment. There were .
tentative discussions of coilsoorating is the digtritution of iy
COSTA Amic books in the United States ‘and of publisaing ;
sone book of NONTEFORTE Toledo's. : 7

+ However, both d@mic aud the EOSFEFORTE Toledos

at all enthusiastic about having anything to do with hin.

LYLE STUART
AREVALO «
“,UTIKOMUSISMO EN AMERICA LATINA” 1

Barly in the spring of 1962, here in Mexico, Avévalo told me that Stuart
ves prodding him abost getting another of bis tooks translated, to teke ed-
vantege of the publicity arouni "The Thark and the Sartines”. T was already
far beyond speaking teras vith Stusrt end therefore declined to bave anything
further to do with hin. About vizee months lever, Arévalo told me that Start
was going to publies “Antikomciswo en Americe Latina” and that a young sertean
student, married to s Mexican, Ansela delli Sente Arrocha (who bed written
"Arevalo, Fensador Contemporeneo"/* was doing the tranalstion into Englieb.
Barly in 1363, Arévelo told me tkat the transistion nedn't been satisfactory
end therefore Stuart had obtained a re-translation, by Cherleton Beals.

When Stuart wes here in Mexico in June, he told Dr. Osecueda thet he vas
very happy about the veytbe book vas selling.

Inagmich as Stuert has paid frévelo only 10 percent of moneys received by
Stuart on "The Suark end the Sariises” sales (in contrast with some book con-
tracts in vbich the suthor receives 10 percent of the money represented by
nunber of copies sold miltiplied ty the retail sales price) I vould assume he
{ig no sore generous with "Antikommiano”. T can esk Dr. Oseguede the exact
terms, but I haven't. been able to see Osegueda this week.

I know of no affiliations of Stuart with foreign political parties of
governsent. His attempts to get close to Fidel Castro in 1960 vere motivated
by a desire to explicit the Jouruelistic edvasteses of an interview. His
original interest in "The Sbart ead the Sardines” was.apparently. motivated by
poney-aaking interes: and by the hope thet he might spark a sensation’ - exact.
What he diz manage 70 Go with bis outregeous efvertising. He seeued to calcu
Jate thet there mig=t be libel sxits possible against the firms and the news-
papers he could provoke to attack hin.

I om gare you Lave it on file, but I'vill enclose a copy of Arevalo’s
original contract vith Stuart. It vas superceded by another in Novenbe> of
$961, granting Stuert certain rights with regard to other foreign tangusge
editions of “The Shark and the Sardines” and, I belfeve, establishing that
Stuart eboula have first option of other Arévalo books trensleted into Baglish.

Information sbout Stuart's dealings with Arévalo md whatever others could
be obtained WITH GUILE from Eileen Brant, wbo vas bis editor at the time of the

Iyle Stuart

Dr. Paul Osegueda
Bartolome Costa Amic
Mario Monteforte Toledo

Dr. Osegueda apparently hes bed a secret longing to get scxething of his
own printed in English. He sefzed upon the opporcunity of commenting Beals!
{introduction to "Actikommnfemo” in order to write to Stuart this spring. Sturt
wrote very cordially back to Osegusda, boping to meet him on a trip to Mexico
in June. when Osegueda confessed to se bis correspondence with Stuart, be
sought to make me see it ag an attexpt to speak with Stuart ebout the royalties
Stuart bas cever paid me.

When Osegueda finally did see Stuart here auring the book congress in June,
he only very timidly and very, very triefly touc ‘ed upon the royalty rroblem, end
Indeed vent to a great deal of trostle to serve Stuart by introducing aia to
Costa Amic and to Mario Monteforte Toledo. (Stuart had expressed interest in ©
getting in touch vith soxe publisters and writers.) Osegueda buctled ehait,
taking Osegueda and Moateforte Toisic to Junch vith Stuart, even mancged to get
‘the Monteforte Toledos to invite Swuart to dinner et their epartzont- ‘There
Vere tentetive discussions of collszorating in the distribution of Coste Amie °

Hovever, both Costa Amica end the Honteforte Toledos told me that they
found Stuart offensively vulgar and vere not 8t ali enthusiastic about having
anything to do with him A
