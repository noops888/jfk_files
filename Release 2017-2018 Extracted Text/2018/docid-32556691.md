Re Bern letter 9/17/65,

J Enclosed are 3 copies of a letter dated 9/30/65

/ from the Swiss Central Police Bureau (SCPB), This letter
was received in answer to an inquiry from this office as to
the reasons which had led the Swiss authorities to believe
that the GUS ALEX against whom they had issued an entry ban
might not be identical with the GUS ALEX who was a gangster
and in whom the Bureau had an interest.

The Bureau is requested to furnish any information
which may identify the GUS ALEX who lives in Evergreen Park,

Illinois, and who works in the Publicity Department of the
Deluxe Cigarette Service, Inc., who is the subject of the

i Swiss entry ban, as the GUS ALEX who is the gangster and
! member of the Chicago crime syndicate so that this informa:
tion can be disseminated to the SCPB,

It is suggested that this may be done, at leas
part, by a comparison of photographs and of handwriting
Specimens from U.S. and Swiss sources as suggested in SCPB
letter dated 9/14/65 which was enclosed with relet.
