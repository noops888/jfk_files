Re Bern letter 9/17/65.

Enclosed are 3 copies

of a letter dated 9/30/65

from the Swiss Central Police Bureau (SCPB) •

This letter

was received in answer to an inquiry from this office as to

the reasons which had led the Swiss authorities to believe

that the GUS ALEX against whom they had issued an entry ban

might not be identical with the GUS ALEX who was a gangster

and

in whom the Bureau had an interest.

The Bureau is requested to furnish any information

which may identify the GUS ALEX who lives in Evergreen Park,

Illinois,

and who works in the Publicity Department of the

Deluxe Cigarette Service, Inc.,

who is the subject of the

Swiss entry ban,

as the GUS ALEX who is the gangster and

member of the Chicago crime syndicate so that this informa

tion can be disseminated to the SCPB.

It is suggested that this may be done, at least in

part, by a comparison of photographs and of handwriting

specimens from U.S. and Swiss sources as suggested in SCPB

letter dated 9/14/65 which was enclosed with relet!

of entry, this person is not mentioned in their files.

Alex has never been subject

county and no sentences have been passed against him at that

place. According to a certificate of Messrs. De Luxe Cigarette

Service Inc, employers of Alex (subject of the interdiction

of entry), this person works in the publicity department of

said firm since 1957 and has never given any reason for

complaints.

In view of the above, we ask you kindly to comply with the

request made in our letter of September 14, 1965, and to

let us have your reply at an early date..

Very truly yours,:
