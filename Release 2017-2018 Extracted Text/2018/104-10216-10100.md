MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: I. Irving Davidson

—_—_

1, At 1000 houre on 31 July 1974, in compliance with instructions
from Mr. Balpern, I met with Niel Ainsley, Chief, Covert Procurensnt/OL,
relative to the Davidson mattor. Ainsley read the Washington FO mamo
vegerding the subject and then called Billy Morgan and asked him to

join us. Morgan ee Chief, Operations Support Branch, Supply Division/OL,

has the direct responaibiliry of funding for, receiving, and storing
items of the type that Davidson is seeking to peddle. After Morgan
xead the Washington meno, a long discussion ensued from which tha
following points emerged:

a. Par instruetions from Mr. Colby, the CIA is
currently engeged in a dialogue with the DoD to
determine the mitual responsibilities of the CIA and
the DoD in future parazilitary operations. One of the
most important aspects of this matter is logistical
support. Although this hae not yet been settled, the

» @ssumption is that the CIA will continue to bear the
major responsibility for procuring Soviet, Bloc, and

(The principal CIA rep in these discussions with the
Bod ia Deputy Chief, Soc.)

b. The CIA inventory of 7.62 Soviet ano has
‘been seriously depleted in the past year and, for

without success. Each attexpt te secure ammo involves
some security risk.

SUBJECT: 1. Irving Davidson .

e. In view of this fact, Morgen offered the opinion “4
that froa a logistical point of view it would be advantageous
.to purchase the entire 25 willion rounda fron Davidson (at
@ cost he estimated to be in the range of $3,125,000.00).
‘This would provide the Agency with e five-year supply and
elininate the necessity for Ainsley running the security
gauntlet every few months to replenish the inventory.

4. Nevertheless, because of Davidson's unsavory
Teputation and his close connection with columist Jack
dndersos, it was generally agreed that hiu utiliestion
would be risky in the extrees.

2. Aineley encocsted that we run the probles by hfs bess, >
Michal Malanick, Chfef, Office of Logistics. Accordingly we net with
Melanick end his Deputy, Janes MeDonald. After as thorough rehash of the
matter, it was agreed that:

@. Morgen will confer with SOG and deteraine
the feasibility of.teking the entire 25 nillion rounds.

b. Ainsley end Morgen will check with their
legitinate aras dealers and see if any of then have
ever heard of Davidson. If so, one of them will
approach hin and ask (innocently) if he knows of
eay 7.62 ammo available.

€. There is also a possibility that one of
Afasley's regular contacts might have sone ides as
to who Davidson's source is. In that case the source
will be approached directly aod Davideon will be cut
out of the pattern.

4. DCD will instruct the Washington Field Office
to tell Devideon that there is no CIA interest in this
acquisition end bow oct of this affair.
