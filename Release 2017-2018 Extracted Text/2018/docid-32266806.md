Dear Andy,

Enclosed are the exhibits and textual material to be added

to my report.

There are eleven figures to be published and they are numbered

on the reverse 1-11 in light pencil and the top of the photograph

indicated.

They were made standard size on glossy paper in a manner similar

to prints weresubmit

for publication in scientific papers.

We have begun work on the exhibit for presentation to the

committee.

Blow-ups of x"rays selected will be made as large as

possible without loss of detail. I plan to use fewer x-rays for the

presentation as not all are necessary. There will be two boards of

mounted photographs, one in the pristine state, the other color coded

for easy recognition

of the areas of comparison on ante mortem and

autopsy x-ray films. This should allow us to accomplish our objective

in a minimum amount of time with no chance of confusion.

I think that it is important that we meet just prior to my

appearance so we can get our act together for a smooth presentation.

I am working on the introductory material and question and

answers and will forward them shortly.

Best Regards.

Towell

DRAFT II - Exhibits

Comparison of dental x-rays are visually quite persuasive

when presented to juries of lay persons as photographic: "blow-

ups". The forensic odontologist can easily demonstrate the

characteristics and relationships he has interpreted to form

his opinion.

Almost at the outset of my examination in consultations

between Dr. Michael M. Baden, the committee staff, and myself,

it was decided it would be very desirable to attempt to get

permission to reproduce portions of x-ray films which were

significant in forming my opinion.

The strongest reason for publishing facsimiles of the

xoray evidence is that they are so much more convincing than

a narrative description of characteristics compared.

The committee staff obtained permission for me to photo-

!

granh and reproduce partiana np the filmát felt vere nerossor

to document the identification and authentication. Autopsy 1.

was not photographed at that time because it was my understanding

that my permission precluded reproducing areas which depicted

injury pattern. The fact that documentation of Autopsy i is

not included in these exhibits should in no way be construed

to

less than a positive identificatic

imply that my opinion as to the authenticity of that film 1s, anything

on November/1 perzonally photographed the tilma at the

National Archives. The' exhibits were produced under my direction

by Walter, Poppe, Forensic Photographer, Office of the Medical
