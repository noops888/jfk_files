HLBA-6911rcported GISNEAKER-9's observations

the local reaction

The ANSPELL team freely admitted

ine tod to wich neat the Bogot one don was

something less than successful, but blamed the lack of advanco prepara

tions and the existeuce

of an unfriendly press for their failure.

should also be noted that the AMSPELL team was not on

the best of terms

with some of the local Cubans, and this fact probably had a good deal

to do with the poor showing.

Medellin;

The showing in Medellin was better than in

Bogota.

The press was lukewarm but the director of the Caracol radio

station gave them considerable publicity, and they were able to hold

the exhibit in a central spot in the city.

About 400 persons visited

the exhibit over a period

of three days,,

and 850 persons attended con-

ferences gives by the team.

The team received good advance press play in Call,

which was perhaps one reason for the fact that the local Communist parts

also well prepared for their arrival.

On the very first morning

of the exhibit, a large crowd of Communists tried to enter the exhibit

and when they were

The incident provided considerable publicity for AuSPELL,

were very strong in Call and that nork

ECLADOR.

The team arrived in Quito on 25 Narch, after spend-

in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain visas for Peru.

QUIT 5867 reported the AMSPELL team's personality clashes with the

local AMBARBs and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team,

who complained of the absence of police protection,

adequate facilities

for the exhibit, etc.,

and departed just two days later on the 27th.

One member remained

in Bogota

to hold conforences

attendod by 325.

While not accepting the blame for this fiasco, the AbSPeLL

team generally corroborated the above story in their debriefing by wAVE.

After such incidents as reported in QUIT 5867, we are reluctant to

recommend any future tours.

Guayaquil

The AMSPELl, team considered Guayaquil their

most successful operation, an opinion seconded by Guayaquil base who

termed it a "resourding success."

40 members of a local group, Frente de Defensa Nacional.

1. Santiago, Chile.

The AISPELL team arrived

in Santiago on 3 March to coincide

with the opening of the Latin American Youth Congress (LAYC).

Santiago operation was a complete loss because Chilean customs authori

would not release the exhibit during the congress and the AMSPELL

team was unable to obtain space of any kind to hold conferences die to

competition from the congress for space.

(See SAGO 6577).

team had been counting on a contact in the Catholic ladiersity,

performance on 25 March at the Scala Theator hosted

by the Vonozuelan

leading La

Pad newspapers and the three largest radio stations carried

ANSPELL conferences.

Despite the excellent publicity,

a total of only

600 persons visited

the exhibit in La Paz.

According

to ANSPELL, this

demand a passage to the sea for Bolivia which stopped all traffic and-

communication,
