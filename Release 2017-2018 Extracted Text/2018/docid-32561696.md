PH 92-444

Philadelphia believes that dissemination to the

Philadelphia Police Department at this time would abort plans

to become thoroughly familiar with the extent of BRUNO's

numbers operation.

Further, it appears that informant's trip

to New York City is indicative of a possible ITAR violation:

Philadelphia believes that open surveillances of

informant and TESTA are premature at this time because of the

sensitivity

of informant's relationship with TESTA, CAVELLI

and BRUNO. It is further believed that no further action

should be taken until the informant has thoroughly penetrated

and digested the extent of BRUNO's numbers operation and advised

the FBI of the identities of persons engaged in the illegal

activity.

Informant has again been instructed to be most

circumspect in noting information such as names, phone numbers

and addresses. He has been instructed to telephonically

furnish this information to the New York Office while it is

fresh in his memory in order that he can minimize note-taking.

Informant stated that he did not call the New York Office

over the 5/5-7/62 week end, as he was instructed, out of fear

of being compromised. Informant thoroughly appreciates the

danger of his position, but he continues to be most cooperative.

He has requested that a Philadelphia Agent be available in

New York to receive his telephone call because of his

reluctance to speak with Agents unknown to him. It is believed,

however, that this arrangement is at this time unnecessary.

In the event it does become necessary, recommendations will

be made.

In the event

informant contacts the new York office,

he will identify himself as FRANK THOMAS.

If he calls, he

should be handled with appropriate dispatch. The New York

Office should vigorously attempt to develop a highly con-

fidential source in CHERICO's residence and should expedite

investigation requested in reference airtel.

Likewise, Boston should expedite investigation

requested in reference airtel.
