Philadelphia believes that dissemination to the
Philadelphia Police Department at this time would abort plans_
to become thoroughly familiar with the extent of BRUNO's
numbers operation. Further, it. appears that informant's trip
to New York City is indicative of a possible ITAR violation.

* Philadelphia believes that open surveillances of
informant and TESTA are premature at this time because of the
sensitivity of informant's relationship with TESTA, CAVELLI
and BRUNO. It is further believed that no further action
Should be taken until the informant has thoroughly penetrated
and digested the extent of BRUNO's numbers operation and advised
the FBI of the identities of persons engaged in the illegal
activity.

Informant has again been instructed to be most
circumspect in noting information such as names, phone. numbers
and addresses. He has been instructed to telephonically
furnish this information to the New York Office while it is

. fresh in his memory in order that he can minimize note-taking.

Informant stated that he did not call the New York Office

over the 5/5-7/62 week end, as he was instructed, out of fear

of being compromised. Informant thoroughly appreciates the
danger of his position, but he continues to be most cooperative.
He has requested that a Philadelphia Agent be available in

New York to receive his telephone call because of his
reluctance to speak with Agents unknown to him. It is believed,
however, that this arrangement is at this time unnecessary.

In the event it does become necessary, recommendations will

be made.

In the event informant contacts the New York Office,
he. will identify himself as FRANK THOMAS. If he calls, he
should be handléd with appropriate dispatch. The New York
Office should vigorously attempt to develop a highly con-
fidential source in CHERICO's residence and should expedite
investigation requested in reference airtel.

Likewise, Boston should expedite investigation
requested in reference airtel. .
