8 December 1977

1. Subject meeting was held in New York City at

the home of MONCURE on 7 December 1977, and attended

by PDLADLE, MONCURE, Vascia Gmirkin and
us

Terrell Hutchison.
2. Financially, there were the following objectives:
a. To apprise PDLADLE that no more loans could
be made.
b. To convince PDLADLE that the New York City
sdatiaia rental property should be retained.
c. To obtain a deed of trust on the property.

3. MONCURE began the discussions with an outline to
PDLADLE of the present administration's position on grant-
ing additional loans, i.e., that no more loans could be
made. He briefly touched on the subject of retaining
the New York City property. PDLADLE repeated his  previ-

ously stated position that the property be sold.

4. After lengthy discussion of PDLADLE's financial
position and the financial demands of his wife, we pre-
sented PDLADLE with "financial position" Figures reflecting

his general.income of four (4) years ago compared with 1977.

Without. going into details of the discussions, -the follow-

ing actions were agreed on by PDLADLE:..

a. Except for one further loan of approximately
$10,000 to pay off a bank mortgage on the
New York City property, no more loans will
be made by the Agency. Note: It is necess-
ary that we advance this payment in order to
obtain a first trust on the property.

b. Concurrent with the advance of about $10,000
noted above, PDLADLE will execute a Deed of

Trust to the Agency (mortgagee to be determined)

a for the present loan balance of $158,350, plus |
the amount required to pay off the bank (approxi- i

mately $10;000). The Agency mortgage would then

be approximately $168,000. This action was

deemed prudent because PDLADLE, having signed
only promissory notes on the loans, could in
fact sell the property at any time without

making any payments to the Agency.

c. To relieve.any adamantine attitude by

not been increased for several years, and

to keep abreast with inflation, we proposed
increasing this by $4,800 per year, i-e.,

from $19,200 to $24,000. This step, aside

from "softening up" LADLE to "no more loans"
and: a first trust on the property, was also
designed to place him in a rather firm financial
position in hopes of “solving” his financial pro-
blems once and for all. LADLE was, of course,
pleased with this increase; and maybe being a
little sharper financially than we have given
‘hin credit for, wanted to know if this 1978
increase of $4,800 could in fact be paid in

a laémp sum in January. Fearful that he would
give this money to his wife for her impending
trip to Spain, he was advised that we could
arrange this payment providing it was only

used to liquidate the Ed Card loan on the farm.

d. In eliminating the bank loan on the
New York City property and the Ed Card loan
on the farm, LADLE's only recurring monthly
obligations, will be the taxes on his pro-
perties and the $1,000 to his wife.
5. MONCURE pointed out that the recording fee on
a mortgage is $1.25/$100; therefore, the fee on a $170.00
would be about $2,125. Since we are insisting on the
mortgage, the Agency should absorb this charge, as well
ag any other nominal charges so related.
6. Herewith a summary of the payments that we should
expect to pay in early 1978:
a. Advance (loan) to pay off bank loan -
About: $10,000
b. Prepayment of retainer increase - referred
to in para 4.c. $ 4,800
c. Recording fees for mortgage $ 2,200
d. LADLE's regular "salary" for
January thru March - 3 x $1,600 $ 4,800

Total: $21,800

7. It should be noted that the above advance (loan)
of $10,000 is presently provided for in the 1978 OPACT, whieh

in fact provides for. "loans" of $20, 000. The “salary” increase

8. As MONCURE is going into a hospital on 9 December
for an operation and with the holiday season shortly there-
after, it was proposed that we attempt to finalize these
transactions on 11 January 1978. This will give MONCURE
an opportunity to advise the bank of the intent to pay off
the loan, and to obtain and record the Ist trust on the pro-
perty.

9. In recognition that the legal involvement should go
beyond MONCURE, a copy of this memo is being sent to the OGC
for their assistance in providing the name of the "mortgagee"
to*be used on the mortgage, presumably a cleared New York
City legal firm, who could also coordinate with MONCURE on

the preparation and recording of the mortgage.
