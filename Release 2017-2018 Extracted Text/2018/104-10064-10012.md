_ A. Origin sna Dovelopment of BEHBIREN. |

1. Founding: -BEHEIREN (Japan "Peace for Vietnam" Con-
Smittes) was organized in Apri’ B politically
dependent group of intellectuals and cultured persons whose

purpose was “to help restore peace in Vietnam." Actually, it
is 2 loosely organized group of ex-JCP members, progressive
intellectuals, leftist cultured persons, and leftwing students
- banded together in the name of opposition to the Vietnam war
by two common denominators, dedicated anti-Americanism and »
refusal to be dominated or controlled sd the orthodox Japan
Communiat Party. . 7
2. Hard-Core Secretariat: Tho real force behind the 3
organization of BEEBIREN, right from the beginning to the
present, bas been a brilliant Communist named YOSHIKAWA
7 zuichi, whose conspiratorial organizational skills have
eon perhaps the most indispensible ingredients’ in BEREIREN's
development. ‘YOSHIKAWA was expolied from Tokyo University »
for his role as a ZENGAKUREN leader in the 1960 U.S./Japan
Security Treaty riots. He then went into fulltime JCP mass
movenent professional work, becoming the Secretariat Gl eee
in charge of international relations for the Japan Peace
Committee. YOSHIKAWA broke with the JCP in late 1564, .
following the rupture in relations between the JCP and CPSU.
in May that year. The inspiration for BEBEIREN springs in
large measure from YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his
» organizational talents in countering the JCP and its Japan
: Peace Committee. YOSHIKAWA, in addition to being a well
qualified English linguist himself, years: ago surrounded
himself with a small following of similarly qualified
licutenants, whom he brought along into BEHELREN to give .:
hin the necessary depth and experience to run this new ee

3. Respectable Intellectual Front: Follewin: :
Coe. oeeeneceunl Front: i funda-
mental unist principles for nass movement work (better

than the JCP itself follows these tenets), the ex-JCP

: organizers of BIREIREN kept themselves in the background

and lined up a nucber of prominent Japanese progressive
intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to front for
BEREIREN. The choice of QDA Makoto, ex-Fulbrighter and
popular young novelist, to be the chief front man — Chair-

“- gan - was an extremely lucky stroke for BEHEIREN. ODA has

s

oe

~ taken to this grand-standing, front work like a duck to

water. It has given him » chance to give unbridled vent to
his own latent anti-American foolings, puffed him up to the
extent that he has been dubbed “the emperor" by other BEHEIREN
activists, and given him at long last an ideological mission
to pursue. YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding
ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrinating ODA so
that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent
anti-Anerican overtones. ODA has served another vital
function for BEHEIREN by recruiting a sizeable number of
fellow intellectuals to join the ranks of BEERIREN activists.
(Attachment 1 is a listing of a number of those Japanese who
have been identified as active BEHEIREN supporters or sympa~

Organizational Development: In its 21/2 year history, ..
BEE: lag DOt appreciably changed its orgnnizational format, —
although it has moved its office three times and modified its
mame even oftener. PEHEIREN is not a “mass organization", be-
cause it has had no sizeable popular backing to the present
time, Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by
YOSHIEAWA and his lieutenants. Its public image, intellectual
,fvont is led by ODA, and given body by a score of like-minded
intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAWA, who form the loose
body of EBEHEIREN's activist leadership.. Under this BEDEIREN
leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several
hundred BEHEIREN “rank-and-file“:supporters, mostly young —
Japanese students. Organizationally, EEHEIREN has no formal

‘* penbership system, so its base of supporters is fluid and not

precisely measurable. However, the base support for BEHEIREN
hss definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and made such

: notable strides during the past summer that JCP Headquarters

officials finally felt constrained to note with concern that ~
BEEEIREN was beginning to drain off a growing number of pro-
gregsive youth who otherwise would have been absorbed into

the JCP's own youth movement. BEHEIREN leaders: have tried to
help this growth along by setting up 2 youth section, coliing
at "Young BEHBIREN.” BERBIREN's imaginative actions and
publicity~conscious programs have been responsible for its
recent growth, and this period of growth seems to be now on



¥ i
the verge of really picking up speed and momentun. “As a result.
of its role in the case of the four deserting sailors, BEHEIREN
has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching a :
delicate Japanese public nerve of sympathy and pacifism, open-
ing a floodgate of support for BEHEIREN from ail over Japan.
When this case fades from the limelight, it is still most
likely that a fair percentage of current wave of _popular

fi

irst tine, a
support its future activities

6. Activities and Accomplishments: BEEEIREN has engaged
in a number of propaganda actions, and participated in inter-
national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co~
operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by |
the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War
Crimes in Vietnam activitiés, which culminated in the Tokyo
Court of last August, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed
by the JCP. In spite of this, BEHEIREN bas churned along at .
dts own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnan war
actions, most of them related in some way to the American
pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHEIREN has succeeded in
cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S.
pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to
promote its own action program. The case of the four deserting
sailors, while an-spparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only
points up the fact that BEHEIREN, through past organizational
work and promotional activities, was “johnny-on-the-spot",
ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take :
the ball and run with it. BEMEIREN ran sll the way in this
case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.

B. The Cese of the Four Sailor Deserters and BERRIREN.

1. How It Started: The consensus of all available overt
media material, with no recorded dissent, indicates that the
four sailors voluntarily left their ship, went AWOL, and ended
up wallowing around Tokyo's hippie-land. Precisely what personal
grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis-adventure is
not yet known. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be
categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in a foreign
land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional
Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the fun and go
back to the ship.: So far, this made their cases far from

sip of their ovn volition or being apprehended by. the
Meek Pateol, the four made contact with BEEEIREN ieaders.
Again, press reports indicate that this was just a coincidence,
= ghat there was NO pre-planning by the four to contact BEREIRE:
There are no available overt nor ‘covert reports that indicate
othervise.: But, once the BEHEIREN people’made contact, they
: fecognized the potential immediately and moved fast for the
S RSll. (Attachment 4 fe a Yomiuri Newspaper clipping, 22 Nov-
enber 1967, that is both a representative and comprehensive
account of this phase of the case. Even if this article
.should contain sone minor inaccuracies, the basic line seens
factual and bas not been challenged eleewkere.)
“"" g" BEHEEREN Takes Over: When the four made contact with
PEREIREN, it suddenly became an entirely different baligane.
BESEIREN had everything needed to capitalize on this: veteran
activist leaders who are experienced enough to recognize the
windfall that had come their way; an apparatus that could
provide hiding places for the four; long standing lisison
contacts with Soviet Embassy offic: for use in pienning
exit from Japan; solid contat reliable Ancrican
pacifists with whom the bona fides of the four sailors could
be checked; money and organization to capitalize on the
propaganda potential (such as preparing a movie film for tho
‘. initial BEHEIREN press conference announcing the desertion,
prepared more likely than not by BEHEIREN stalwart,
: Eeinosyke, an independent film producer) and English speaking
activists capable of sympathizing, encouraging, soothing, or
agitating the four young sailors, so that there would be no -

-gnall pieces of this puzzle, which would put the whole case in
proper detailed chronological order and eliminate specuiztion
on minor points, are still missing, enough ia known now, -
through overt and covert sources, that the picture of BEHEIREN's
‘adept handling of this case shines through clearly. The follow

) Hide-out: When BEHEIREN got hold of the four on -
about 26 October, they had to be hidon out for the approxinate
