Intellectual Front:

Following funda-

than the JCP itsolf follows those tenets), the ex-JCP

organizers of ELBEIREN kept themsolvos

and lined up a nurber of prominent Japanese progressive

Intelloctuals and leftist cultured persons to front 10s

BEFEIRE®

The choice of ODA Hakoto, ex-Fulbrighter and

popular young novelist, to be the

chief front san - Chair-

man - was an extrenoly lucy stroke for BLusIReN.

ODA has

taken to this grandstanding, front nort 11k0 & ducis to

It has civen him a chance to give unbridled vent to

bis own latent anti-Anerican foolings, pulled hia up to the

extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor" by other BEHEIREN

activisto, and givon him at long last an Ideological mission

to pursue.

YOStiKAYA has performed magaificently in feeding

OnA's ego needs and in Infusing and Indoctrianting ODA so

that his words and actiona take on sulliciently virulent

anti- Aerican overtones.

Odd has served anothor vital

history,

STUCIREN has not appreciably changed 1ts organizational format

Intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKATA, who form the loose

body of BEHEIaiN's activiet loadership. Under this BSICIPEN

leadership superstructure lios a paltry base of only several

bundred BEHEIREN "rank-and-file" supporters, mostly young

Japanese students Organizationly, edithst has no ornal

precisely seasurzble. However, the sise support or t

has definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and nade such

notablo strides during the past summer that JCP Headquarters

officials finally felt constrained to note with concern that

BEEIREN was boginning to dralt oft & growing number of pro-

gressive youth who otberwise would have been absorbed into

the ICP's own youth novenent.

BOASTERN leaders have tried to

help this grouth along by sottine up a youth section, calling

it "Young BEHEIREN. "

BEFEIREN's inngisative actlons and

publicity conscious programs have been responsible for 1ts

SUPPOrt {ON BEHEIREN 11] sOlId151 tate permanent mass backing,

giving Bbst Role jor the first time, & meaninriul base to

support its future activities.

Activities and Accomplishments:

BEFCIREN has engaged

in a number of propaganda actions,

and participated 1n inter

national anti-Viotnam Var activities.

It has tried to co

operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by

the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War

Crimes 1n Vietnam activitles,

which culminated in the Tokyo

Court of last August,

but has been soundly and rudely rebuifed

In spIte of this, BEHEIREN has churned along at

its own pace, with a continuing series of antl-Vietnan war

actions, most of then related in some way to the American

pacifist novement.

In this regard, ERFEIREN has succeeded in

cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S.

pacifist movements,

and has effectually capitalized on this to

pronote its own action program. The case of the four deserting

sailors, while an apparent luchy windfall for Beasluet, only

points up the fact that BEEKIREN, through past organizational

work and pronotional activities, was "johnny-on-the-spot",

ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take

the ball and run with it. BELEIREN ran all the way in this

case and scored its most notable success since it was organized.

(Attachment 2 is a listing of BEHCINEN's more notable activitios

since its founding.

B. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BOHEIREN.

1.

How It Started:

"The consensus of 111 available overt

medis material,

with no recorded dissent,

indicates that the

four sailors voluntarily left their ship, vent AlOl, and ended

up wallowing around Tokyo's hippie land.

Precisoly that personal

grievances prompted the four to embark on this misadventure is

not yet knows. But, up to this point, the four could fairly be

categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in 1 foreign

land, and due to get slapped back in line with traditional

Navy justice when they linally decided to stop the lun and go

back to the ship. So far, this made their cases far from

unique:

(New York, November 20, Correspondent Tadashi ONODERA).

Professor

.. Ernest hitole of Dartmouth College in the U.S., consented to an interview

With this reporter on the question of the four American seamen who deserted

i from the U.S. aircraft carrier Intrepid.

At the interview held on the 19th,

s Professor YOUNG clarified that the Peace for

Vietnam Association (Beheiren,

with Makoto ODA acting as its representative) contacted an anti-war organiza

tion in the U.S., and at this, Professor YOUNG hurriedly visited Tokyo, and

meeting the four seanen in a room in an apartment house in Jokyo on the 9th

Professor::: I arrived. in Haneda on November 8, and met the four seamen

foon the 9th and the 10th.: The place of interview was in an apartment house

I in Tokyo, but I cannot say at this time where that apartment house was and

... who owned it..: However, on both days, I talked fully with these four seamen,

Turo"" What were the motives for these four seamen's desertion?

Professor: The desertion was completely the decision of these four

,,:persons.

It seems that the four seamen decided not to returm to the ship,

when the Intrepid entered Yokosuka Port on October. 17, and they were per

su mitted to go ashore for rest for one week..

My impression.on meeting these

the purpose of

3p. four seamen was that they were definitely not deserting fo. I am convinced

cisself-advertisement or that they were giving false reasons.

"that they deserted ready. out of doubt about the Vietnam war.

-What were the movenents of the for, after they deserted?

Professor: On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid

was due to sai, the four went to shinjur, and told the people whom they

net at a bar they happened to visit, that "we are fed up with war." The

Japanese who heard them sympathized with them, and at one time, the four

lived with sone hippies (according to this paper's investigations; they

include Mr. H., a student of Tokyo University's Liberal Arts Department,

and vanguard artist A., who gather at fugetsudo in Shinjuku.) Finally,

they were taken to Beheiren by a student who spoke English (according to

this paper's investigation, this was Mr. S., a Waseda University student).

After that, they were hidden by Beheiren.

I cannot say where they were

:? The four seamen's desertion was announced in the form of a press:

interview given by Beheiren, Were there no facts of their having been

forced to desert, during that period? ende

Professor: I ascertained that point, too, However, they firmly denied

any fact of their having been forced, saying that they had voluntarily

valconsulted Beheiren as to whether they should publicly announce the fit"

intention to desert, and if so, in what form this should be made.

_ Where are the four seamen. now, and where are they planning to go?

Professor: I am certain that the four of'them were still in Japan,

up until the with, the day I left for home.

However, they already knew

fully well that it was not possible for them to obtain asylum in Japan.

They even said that "we will propably have to go to some third nation,

which is neutral." (The public security authorities judge that the four

seamen left Japan immediately after Mr. YOUNG's persuasion, and consider that

Beheiren announced their desertion at.a press

Don evening.of the 13th.)

Professor, When the films were publicly shown, there was bigi excitement,

with rows and rows of television and press cameramen. I thought I would be

exposed to persistent questioning by the FBI and the CIA, after I returned

ryr.home, but so far, I have only been questioned bnce by; the Navy!s. Intelligence

saying: "My son is a most average American youth. His school records

wwere quite ordinary, and he liked sports, just, like any other student.

I cannot understand why he acted in such a way.!"
