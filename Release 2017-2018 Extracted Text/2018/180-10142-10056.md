of the U.S. Intelligence Community.*
As a visual aid to the analysis of the materials

contained in’ the four compilations discussed above, a

chart has been prepared which illustrates the flow of

written information from the CIA to the Warren Commission

and the U.S. Intelligence Community concerning President

Kennedy's assassination. This chart sets forth the C IA's

designation for each document listed and lists the subject

matter of each document-and the date of each document's

dissemination. The chart also indicates whether the document

was made available to the Warren Commission, the U.S.

Intelligence community or both. A secondary purpose of

this chart is to indicate for selected subjects the volume

of information provided to the U.S. Intelligence Community

as opposed to the Warren Commission.

During the course of this study, additional Agency
files have been reviewed. These files have been examined
in an effort to resolve certain issues created by the re-
view of the Agency's compilations discussed herein. Where
apparent gaps existed in the written record, files have
been requested and reviewed in an effort to resolve these
gaps. Where significant substantive issues have arisen
related to the kind and quality of information provided

the Warren Commission, files have also been requested and

Mr. Rocca added that, to his knowledge, Mr. Helms'
orders were followed to the letter by all CIA employees.
(Ibid. p. 24.) Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:
“the (CIA was to turn over and to develop any information
bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance
to the Warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the
supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was
propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as
the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren
Commission investigation was directly responsible for the
CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination
(Ibid. p. 23.) He testified to the Committee that the
CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to
Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard
Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony
regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-
mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would cofie over (from the’ Warren

Commission). We would attempt to respond

to it. But these inquiries came in indivi-

dual items...Each individual item that came

along we took care of as best we could.

(Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the

CIA provided information to the Warren Commission primarily

on the basis of the Commission's specific requests. Under

effect. The following exchange between Committee Gounsel

Tha
and Mr. Helms illustrates the acutemiteg ve the Agency's
compromise:

Mr. Goldsmith: Mr. Hgens , I take it from your testi-
mony that your position is that the
anti-Castro plots, in fact, were rele-
vant to the Warren Commission's work;
and, in light of that, the Committee
would like to be informed as to why
the Warren Commission was not told by
you of the anti-Castro assassination
plots.

Mr. Helms: I have never been asked to testify before
the Warren Commission about our operations.

Mr. Goldsmith: Ifithe Warren Commission did-not know
of the operation, it certainly was not
in a position to ask you about it.

Is that not true?

Mr. Helms: Yes, but how do you know they did not know
about it? How do you know Mr. Dulles had
not told them? How was I to know that?
And besides, I was not the Director of ee
the Agency and in the CIA, you did not go.
traipsing around to the Warren Commission
or to Congressional Committees to to any-
place else without the Director's permis-
sion.

Mr. Goldsmith: Did you ever discuss with the Director whe-
ther the Warren Commission should be in-
formed of the anti-Castro assassination
plots?

Mr. Helms: I did not, as far as I recall.

EEE. Mr. McCone testified that he first
became aware of the CIA's anti-Castro assassination plots
involving CIA-Mafia ties during August 1963. He stated
that upon learning of these plots, he directed that the

Agency cease all such activities. (McCone deposition, p.13)



whether

the CIA desired to withhold information from the Warren
Commission about the Agency anti-Castro assassination plots
to avoid embarassing the Agency or causing an international
cris@é§ he responded:

"I cannot answer that since they (CIA employees

knowledgeable of the continuance of such plots)

withheld the information from me. I cannot an-

swer that question. I have never been satisfied
as to why they withheld the information from me.

P- way Mr. Rocca testified that had he known of the anti-

John Scelso, the above-cited CIA desk officer

who ran the CIA's initial investigation of President Ken-

nedy's assassination until that responsibility was given

to the CIA's counterintelligence staff, offered a highly

critical appraisal of Helms' non-disclosure to the Warren

Commission:

Mr. Goldsmith: Do you think Mr. Helms was acting properly
when he failed to tell the Warren Commission
about the assassination plots?

Mr. Scelso: No, I think that was a morally highly re-
prehensible act, which he cannot possibly
justify under his oath of office, or any

other standard of professional public service.
(Scelso dep., p.153)

Introductory Section/SS+M

The length of time required by the CIA to respond
to the Warren Commission's requests for information has
been shown to have been dependent upon 1) the availability
of information. and 2)the complexity of the issues pre-
sented by the request. on this point, Mr. Helms testified
that when CIA had been able to satisfy a Commission re-
quest, the CIA would then send a reply back:

"and some of these inquiries obviously took
longer than others.

For example, some might involve
checking a file which was in Washington.
Other inquiries might involve trying to see
if we could locate somebody in some overseas
country.

Obviously, one takes longer to per-
form than the other. (Helms Exec. Session
hearing, p.25)

Mr. Rocca, as the day to day CIA working level
contact with the Warren Commission stated that on the
average it took less than one week for the CIA to transmit
its information to the Warren Commission, after such in-
formation had been processed by the Agency. (Rocca dep.,

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations, as outlined above, was

evident from the abeception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that “we were not authorized at first
to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.

examination of the background to the first major CIA

tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was

As noted previously, on January 31, 1964, the CIA

On February 1, 1964 Helms appeared before the
Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-
dum of January S/ , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee
Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of
January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

Ars weitins
aioe AS Of tembaiememeie, the Warren Commission
had no substantive knowledge off
lor the production i.e., the tapes and trans-
cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-
ruary 10, 1964 fatter whether oswald's direct communica-
tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in
¢ umn of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated
by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-
mission had been informed of )
: ‘Oswald this inquiry
by Rankin would not have been made.
Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this
conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between
the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-
mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-
ters in Langley, Virginia and had been shown various trans—
cripts resulting from the CI.

/ Mexico City. (ROcca dep. p.89) However,

a Rocca did not personally make this material available
to Commission representatives and was not able to state

under oath precisely the point in time at which the Warren

Commission learned of these operations.


ie Sti

a hick .
On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to Rankin's
inquiry of February 10. The Agency response did indi-
cate that Oswald had phoned the Soviet Consulate and was
also interviewed at the Consulate. However, the Agency did
not reveal the source of this information in its response
to the Commissiowfpr indicate that it would be revedled

by other means (e.g. by oral briefing).

Vv. During the period of March - April 1964, David
Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which among other
issues concerned Warren Commission knowledge of and access
to the production material derived from the cxf )
> Mexico City. A review of
these memoranda ten@to support the Committee's belief
that the Warren Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman,
and Willems did not obtain access to CI )
cl mpterials until April 9, 1964. ax that time, Coleman,
Gruson and Willens met with Win Scott, the CIA's Chief

lends some support to the position that the Commission had

been informed of the Dorticos-Armas conversations through

the CIA's initiative.


SSE preset

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

7 7 PALLIN AS 7
that the tentative conclusions aegmantiaiaeiee, Oswald's

that he had reacheg were derived from CIA

memoranda® of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

Mexico trip,

and,in addition a Mexican federal police summary Sgr of
interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination
with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that safvson placed limited
reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there
is no indication that saison had been provided the Duran

:)transcripts. In fact, by virtue of
Slawson's comments conerning the Mejftan police report,
it would appear that the Warren Commission,as of March 25

/ ¢

had been provided little substantive information pertaining
to Sylvia Duran. + insect 72%

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been
given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported
by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)
wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited
the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

Logically, access to the

Silvia Duran telephoned the Soviet Embassy and stated
that an American was presently at the Cuban Embassy, re-
questing an in-transit visit to Cuba. This American was
determined by CIA analysts to be Oswald. Again on Septem-
ber 28, at 11:51 a.m. Duran telephoned the Soviet Consulate
stating that an American, identified by CIA analysts as

On April 3, 1964, Coleman and Slawson articulated
their concern for receiving-complete access to all materialS
relevant to Oswald's Mexico City trip. They wrote:
the most probable final result of the entire
investigation of Oswald's activities in Mexico is
a conclusion that he went there for the purpose

of trying to reach Cuba and that no bribes, con-

spiracies, etc. took place.


+--In order to make such a judgment (that all reasonable

lines of investigation that might have uncovered other

motivations or possible conspiracies have been followed

through with negative results), we must become familiar

with the details of what both the American and Mexican

investigatory agencies there have done. This means

xveading their reports, after translation, if necessary,

and in some cases talking with the investigators

themselves.

Upon the group's arrival in Mexico City, they were met
by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra of the State
Department, Clarke Anderson of the FBI, and Winston Scott of
the CIA.

That same day during a meeting between the Commission
representatives and Win Scott, Scott made available to the
group actual transcripts of th : : )
operations and English translations of the same. In addition,
he provided the group with reels of photographs for the
time period covered by Oswald's visit that had resulted from
photosurveillance of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy entrances
David Slawson wrote:

"...Mr. Scott stated at the beginning of his narrative
that he intended to make a complete disclosure of all
facts, including the sources of his information, and
that he understood that all three of us had been cleared
for TOP SECRET and that we would not disclose beyond
the confines of the Commission and its immediate staff
the information we obtained through him without first
clearing it with his superiors in Washington. We

agreed to this." (Slawson memo, April 22, 1964, p. 22)

Mr. Scott described to the Commission representatives

the CIA's course of action immediately following the assassination.

imacdhiaktly
Scott indicated that his staff oumeemmammet began to compile

dossiers on Oswald, Duran, and everyone else throughout Mexico
whom the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald (p.22).
Scott ieee Cuban and Russian intelligence agents
had immediately been put under surveillance following the
assassination, ))uexican officials,
particularly Litis Echevarria, Acting Minister of the

Mexican Goleernacion (pp. 23-24). Slawson then concluded =


"Scott's narrative plus the material we were shown dis-
closed immediately how incorrect our previous
information had been in Oswald's contacts with the
Soviet and Mexican Embassies. Apparently the
distortions and omissions to which our information had
been subjected had entered some place in Washington,
because the CIA information that we were shown b Scott
was unambiguous on almost all the crucial points. We
had previously planned to show Scott, Slawson's
reconstruction of Oswald's probable activities at the
embassies to get Scott's opinion, but once we saw how
badly distorted our information was we realized that
this would be useless. Therefore, instead, we decided
to take as close note as possible f<-~ tha svininal

On November 23, 1963, Marguerite Oswald was shown by
FBI Special Agent Odum a photograph of a man bearing no
physical resemblance to her son. THe photograph had been

Station after Agency representatives had searched their files

surrounding the eventual explanation given to the Commission

of the origin of the photograph in question. Scelso stated:


"We did not initially disclose to the Warren
Commission all of our technical operations. In other
words, we -did not initially disclose to them that we
had photosufveillance because the November photo we had
(of MMM) was not of Oswald. Therefore it did not mean
anything, you see?"

Mr. Goldsmith: ...So the Agency was making a unilateral
decision that this was not relevant to the Warren
Commission.

Scelso: Right, we were not authorized, at first, to reveal
all our technical operations.

On March 5, 1967, Raymond Rocca wrote in an internal

respond directly to Rankin's request of February 12 regarding
CIA material forwarded to the Secret Service since Novemlr 23,

“Unless you feel otherwise,’ Jim would prefer

to wait out the Commission on the matter covered by
paragraph 2 (of the above-referenced February 12
letter). If they come back on this point he feels

that you, or someone from here, should be prepared to

pass them to them in copy. Incidentally, none of these
items are of new substantive interest. We have either
passed the material in substance to the Commission in

On March 12, 1964, representatives of the Warren
Commission and the CIA confered regarding the February 12
request for the materials forwarded to the Secret Service by
the Agency. (See Rankin letter of March 16, 1964 and Slawson
memo, March 12, 1964) :

The record indicates that the Commission at the March 12
meeting pressed for access to the Secret Service materials.
Rankin wrote to Helms on March 16 that it was his understanding
that the CIA would supply the Commission with a paraphrase of
each report or communication pertaining to the Secret Service
materials “with all indications of your confidential communica-
tions techniques and confidential sources deleted. You will
also afford members of our staff working in this area an
Opportunity to review the actual file so that they may give
assurance that the paraphrase are complete." (Rankin letter of
March 16, 1964, #2)

Rankin further indicated. that the same procedure Zt
be followed regarding any material in the possession of the
CIA prior to November 22, 1963 which had not yet been furnished
because it — sensitive sources and methods. (Rankin
letter of March 16, #3)

Helms responded to Rankin's March 16 letter on March 24
(DDP4-1554, CD631 and DDP4-1555, CD 674) by two separate
communications. CD63l1 provided the Commission with a copy of
the October 10, 1963 CIA dissemination to FBI, State Dept.,

INS and Navy Dept. (SS on 22 Nov.) regarding Lee Harvey Oswald
and his presence at the Soviet Consulate in Mexico City. The
response further revealed that on October 23, 1964, CIA had

:


- 39 -

requested two copies of the most recent photograph of Oswald in

‘order to check the identity of the person believed to be

Oswald in Mexico City. Furthermore, the CIA stated that it

had determined that the photograph shown to Marguerite

Oswald on November 22, 1963 did not refer to Lee Harvey Oswala PAYS
by checking the photograph against the press photographs of

Oswald generally available on November 23, 1963.

CD 674 reveals that on November 22, 1963, immediately
following the assassination, and on November 23, 1963, three
cabled reports were received at CIA headquarters from the CIA
Mexico City Station regarding photographs of an unidentified man
who had visited the Cuban and Soviet Embassies during October
and November 1963. Paraphrases of these cables, not, revealing
sensitive sources and methods, were attached to CD 674. The
Agency further stated that the subject of the photo referenced

w
in these cables was not Oswald. It m@ further stated that:

“In response to our meeting of 12 March and your memo

of 16 March, Stern and Willens will review at Langley

the regional copies of these 3 disseminations to the

Secret Service andthe cables on which they were based,as

well as the photos of the unidentified man." (CIA,

p. 116444 of notes)

On March 26, William Coleman wrote in a memorandum for
the record:

"The CIA directed a memorandum to J. Lee Rankin on March 24,196

(Commission Document No. 631) in which it set forth the
dissemination of the information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

I realize that this memorandum is only a partial answer

to our inquiry to the CIA dated March 16, 1964 and I hope

that the complete answers will give us the additional
information we requested."


Coleman went on to state:

"As you know, we are still trying to get an

explanation of the photograph which the FBI showed

Marguerite Oswald soon after the assassination. I

hope that paragraph 4 of the memorandum of March 24,

1964 (CD 631) sent Mr. Rankin. by the CIA is not the

answer which the CIA intends to give us as to this

inquiry."

The following day, as agreed by Warren Commission and
Agency representatives, Samuel Stern of the Commission visited
CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

: othis visit

Sterns' memorandum*reveals that he reviewed Oswald's
file with Raymond Rocca. Stern indicated that Oswald's file
contained those materials furnished previously to the Warren
Commission by the CIA. The fil@ also contained:

My “cable reports of November 22 and November 23 from
the CIA's Mexico City Station relating to the photo-
. graph of the unidentified individual mistakenly
believed to be Lee Harvey Oswald and the reports on
those cables furnished on November 23, 1963 to
“
the Secret Service by the CIA.

Stern noted that these messages were accurately para-
phrased in the attachments to CD 674 provided the Warren
Commission on March 24, 1964.

g Stern also reviewed thé October 10, 1963 cable from

CIA's Mexico City Station to the CIA headquarters
reporting Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. He also reviewed the October 10,

1963 cable from CIA headquarters to the Mexico City

Station reporting background information on Oswald.


VII.

aH - 41 ~-

Stern noted that these messages were also paraphrased
seh forth
accurately aS m7!) in the CIA's January 31 memo to the
Warren Commission reporting Oswald's Mexico City trip.

Lastly, Stern noted that Rocca provided him for his
review a computer printout of the references to oswalare lacked,
documents located in the Agency's electronic data storage
system. He stated "there is no item listed on the printout
which the Warren Commission has not been given either in full
text or paraphrased."

Thus, by the 27th of March, a Warren Commission representa-

tive had been apprised of the circumstances surrounding the

mysterious photograph.

Allan Dulles' Role vis-a-vis the CIA-Warren Commission

Relationship

It has been alleged that Allan Dulles, former Director
of Central Intelligence and one of the $even members of the
Warren Commission, concealed crucial information from the Warren
Commission. Specifically,-the Senate Select Committee
concluded:

“With the exception of Allan Dulles, it is unlikely

that anyone on the Warren Commission knew of CIA
assassination efforts...Allan Dulles, who had been
Director of Central Intelligence until November 1961

was a member of the Warren Commission and knew of the

CIA plots with underworld figures which had taken place
during his tenure at the Agency." (SSC, Book V, pp. 67-68)

However, the SSC did not explore further the relationship and
allegiancegof Dulles as a Warren Commission member and Dulles
as a former DCI of the CIA. The Committee has consequently

xeviewed files maintained by the CIA related to Mr. Dulles'


service on the Warren Commission. In the course of this review,

a memorandum was uncovered which indicates Dulles wou

David Murphy's memorandum of July 8, 1964 concerned

ako,
his discussions with Allan Dulles ssegmaittumganosenko's knowledge
of Oswald. This memorandum was prepared for DDP Helms.
Pq Murphy wrote:

"Mr. Dulles, with whom I spoke today recalled his
earlier conversation with you on this subject and said
that there were still some members of the Commission who
were concerned lest they suppress the Nosenko information
now only to have it surface at a future date. They

expressed concern that this could: possibly prejudice
the entire Warren Commission Report."

Murphy responded to Dulles' statement by stating that
the Commission's concern was understandable but that the Agency
\ felt the Commission's final report should make no mention of
Nosenko's information. Murphy indicated that a possible
alternative would be to use language "which would allude to
the existence of other, unverified information on the Oswald
case." This language, Murphy contended, would permit the
Warren Commission to state, if challenged on this point at a

future time, that it had given consideration to the Nosenko

information.


Murphy continued:

"It was agreed an effort would be made to find such
language if Mr. Dulles is again unsuccessful in
persuading his colleagues to eliminate any reference

to the Nosenko information from the report. To attempt
this, howéver, we would have to know precisely in what
context the Warren Commission intended to make use of
the Nosenko information. This, Mr. Dulles will have to
determine from Mr. Rankin. He will do this as soon as
possible. He knows that I am leaving this week and
therefore, will contact you as soon as he has the informa-
tion he needs from Mr. Rankin."

Whether by design or as an unintended result, the
quoted language indicates that Mr. Dulles, as a member of the
Warren Commission, was prepared to compromise his position
with the Commission in order to supply the CIA, specifically
Murphy and Richard Helms, with sensitive information SS

the Commission's attitudes towards the Nosenko case. I 1so

appears that the AGency had communicats the information

and Richard Helms, David Murphy and Tennant Bagley of the CIA.


Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's
assassination,.a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named
“Luisa". received a telephone call from an unidentified man
speaking Spanish. (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-
ment) This call had been : ‘e the CIA's
Mexico City Station as the result of it:
operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the
Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then
employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban
Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified
caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa
replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The calle-went on to tell Luisa that the person
apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of
the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that
she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being
held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller
replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned
nothing else about the assassination; that she had learned
about the assassination only a little while ago. The

unidentified caller commented:


Aiea We think that if it had been or had

seemed...public or had been one. of the
segregationists or against intergration

who had killed Kennedy, then there was,

let's say, the possibility that a sort a
of civil war would arise in the United

States; that contradictions would be
sharpened...who knows

Luisa responded:

Imagine, one two, three and now, that makes
three. (She laughs.)

[2 ST jp response to

a 1975 Rockefeller Commission request for information on

that contains the suggestion of foreknow-

23 May 1975, p. 15)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic com-
ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may in-

deed indicate ‘foreknowledge of the assassination but may

also-egmmiey be interpreted without such a sinister impli-

cation. Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein, the

Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case did

merit serious attention in the months following the assas-

sination. However, Calderon's comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.

...Washington should urgently consider feasi-
bility of requesting Mexican authorities to
arrest for interrogation: Eusebio Azcue,

Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal. The two

men are Cuban national and Cuban consular
officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary in Cuban



‘Consulate here."

This cable does not state the basis for arresting
Calderon. However, the CIA's copy of this cable bears a
handwritten notation on its routing page. That notation
states: "Info from Amb Mann 507 See, RusK re: ...persons
involved with Oswald in Cuban Embassy.

Mann went on to state in urgent terms:

“They may quickly be returned to Havana in order

to eliminate any possibility that Mexican govern-

ment could use them as witnesses."

According to CIA files, Calderon returned to Havana
on December 16, 1963, less than four weeks after the as-
sassination.

Calderon, Azcue and Mirabal were not arrested nor
detained for questioning by the Mexican federal police.
However, Silvia Duran, a friend and associate of Calderon's
and the one person believed to have had repeated contact
with Oswald while he was in Mexico City, was arrested and
questioned by the Mexican police on two separate occasions
(Cites). During her reinterrogation, Duran was questioned

A Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in

Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying
Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed

to be 1940 (Dispatch, 21612) Calderon's presence in
Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,

1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to
the CIA's Mexico City shStion and to the Chief of the CIA's

On May further disclosed AMMUG's know-

ledge of the Oswald case. ( | eae AMMUG's

knowledge of Calderon as follows: a

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned about
17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to
Mexico, that she had been involved with an
American in Mexico. The information to which
I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...
I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange
that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from
the DGI althought she apparently did not do any
work for the Service. (The case officer) told
me that hers was a peculiar case and that he
himself believed that she had been recruited in
Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-
though Manuel Pineiro, the Head of the DGI, did
not agree. As I recall, (the case officer) had
investigated Luisa Calderon. This was because,
during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had
intercepted a letter to her by an American who
signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

1 similar. As you know, the pronunciation of
Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so
I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-
dez should be spelled. It could have been "Howard"
or something different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love letter
but indicated that there was a clandestine-
professional relationship between the writer and
Luisa Calderon. I also understand from (the
case officer) that after the interception of
the letter she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American. JI do not know if this
could have been Oswald...
