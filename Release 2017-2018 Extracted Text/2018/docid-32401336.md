however, in the meaningful political
and military unity the previous re-
gime was aiming for.

a. Pamphlets and posters
bitterly lampooning Nasir, espe-
cially for his involvement in Yemen
and Algeria, have appeared on the
streets of Cairo and Suez.

b. Such public expression of
anti-Nasir sentiment is highly
unusual.

c. It is still in a very low
key, however, and there is no sign
of organized opposition.

d. We do not consider Nasir
to be in any immediate danger of
overthrow, though he could be forced
to modify unpopular policies if the

PETE BLE
The new 2l-man cabinet ap-
pears to be a coalition of Arab
nationalist elements including four
| members of the moderate wing of the
7 Baath Party. The regime is still
dominated by the military, with eight
cabinet posts.

b. The new prime minister,
Tahir Yahya, is sympathetic to the
Baath Party, and both the Baathists
and the Egyptians feel they can
trust him.

ec. The political affiliation
of eight of the new ministers is
not known, but the key interior post
is in the hands of an anti-Baathist
nationalist.

a. Defense Minister Nasution
* has been ordered by Sukarno to make

conciliatory statements on Malaysia
while on his trip abroad,

b. The Dutch chargé who re-
ported this euplained that Nasution
was chosen for this job because 8

ce. The chargé has no informa-
tion on the motives behind this
switch. Our embassy thinks it may
be a move to pave the way for explora-
tory talks by Foreign Minister Suband-
rio at Bangkok with his Thai and
{ Philippine counterparts.. It may also
be meant to provide a more recep-
tive attitude for Nasution's visit
here,

d. Our embassy thinks Nasution
went in for his Malaysia sabre rat-
tling on Sukarno's orders, or at
the very least, with the president's
tacit support. Sukarno may feel
Nasution has stolen some of his
thunder.

a. Adoula still did not get

b. The collapse of Prime Min-
ister Inonu's coalition government
appears increasingly likely. Though
a new coalition may be formed, there
will be considerable resistance to
the retention of Inonu as prime min-
ister.

their new responsibilities. There
are, however, a few signs of dissen-
sion within this group and between
it and civilian politicians,

g. One of the more ambitious
and troublesome figures is the able
but opportunistic General Ton That
Dinh, the new Minister of Security.
He has been travelling about the
country spreading the idea that the
coup was largely his doing and seems
bent on developing his own independ-
ent base of power. He is a man to
watch.

h. The new regime has also
embarked on a purge of high military
officers who sided with Diem during
the Buddhist crisis.and failed to

Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks"

a. North Vietnamese leaders
are pressing their campaign for neu-
tralization of South Vietnam,

b. They can count on Cambodia's
support. Prince Sihanouk has said
he believes neutralization of South
Vietnam to be the only way to keep
his country and the rest of the area
from falling eventually into Commu-
nist hands,

¢. The French feel the same
way. Indeed, Souvanna Phouma re-
portedly told a closed session of
the Laotian National Assembly that
the French were urging him to sup-
port Hanoi in this.

d, Moreover, according to one
of our clandestine sources, the North
Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into
backing the neutralization proposi-
tion in the UN.

e. The troublesome Polish ICC
delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who
will be going home soon), has just
returned to Vientiane from Hanoi and
is trying, with somewhat less suc-
cess, to enlist British support too.

Vietnamese leaders feel that neutral-
ity for South Vietnam and eventual
reunification is the only way they,
too, can escape from Peiping's clutches.

a. As is usual in Laos, the
tentative agreement for a cease-fire
reached last week between Kong Le

came to naught.

screen preparations for larger at-
tacks,

3. Cambodia oe a. Sihanouk knows his actions

he is looking to the French to bail
him out.

the Communists and fend off their

d. The French have told our
Embassy in Paris that plans are
afoot for French Defense Minister
Messmer to go to Cambodia in January.

e. Sihanouk's actions toward
the US have not been universally
popular, This is particularly true
among government officials, the bus-

fear stepped-up nationalization),
and the military, where the US re-

a. Vietnamese Communist forces
-kept up their high post-coup level
of activity over the weekend.

b. The most significant action
was an attack early yesterday morn-
ing against a US special forces train-
ing camp some 30 miles from Saigon.

c. When the smoke cleared after
a sharp fight, four US soldiers were
missing and at least 35 South Vietnamese
were dead,

d. Late yesterday morning, the
Viet Cong shot down two aircraft sup-
porting a government operation in
the extreme south, and damaged twelve
more. Two more Americans are missing
in this action.

e. Back in Saigon, the new re-
gime's troubles with the ambitious
General Ton That Dinh continue.

f£. He is still angling to get
control of the important strategic
hamlet program and has yet to give
up command of the Third Corps, which
the generals assigned to another of
their number earlier in the month.
This corps is of particular signifi-
cance in that it surrounds Saigon.

a. According to press reports,
Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped

out two of the government's strategic
hamlets in the central highlands about
250 miles north of Saigon.

b. More than 1,000 inhabitants
in the hamlets--who are minority
tribesmen--are missing and possibly
have fled into the mountains. They
abandoned a significant quantity of
weapons to the Viet Cong.

ce. These attacks not only sug-
gest continued erosion of the govern-—
ment's programs to win over tribal
support, but also signal that stepped-
up Viet Cong pressure against the new
regime is spreading to the north.

Stalinist excesses have put him on

search to locate Colonel Chenault

come to nought. The only news has
been from a Caracas editor who had
a call yesterday morning from a
woman saying the colonel was safe.

a. The discovery of a large
cache of weapons of Cuban origin,
announced by Venezuelan authorities
yesterday, provides the best evidence
to date of major Cuban support for
Latin American subversives.

b. There is definite proof
to support the Venezuelan claim.
The three tons of weapons found in-
elude light automatic rifles and

submachine guns identified as among
those shipped to Cuba from Belgium
in 1959 and 1960. There were also
mortars, bazookas, recoilless rifles,
and ammunition of US manufacture.

ce, Communist documents seized
by Venezuelan authorities earlier
seh this month reveal that the equipment
: was destined for the Venezuelan
Communists' paramilitary arm, the
Armed Forces of National Liberation

is d. The cache was found on 1

z November on a beach in Falcon State
in the north, scene of the most -
active guerrilla effort. The Vene-
s zuelan government assumes that the
eae weapons were sent from Cuba by sea.

e. Caracas will lay formal
charges concerning the arms cache
before a special meeting of Latin
America Foreign Ministers scheduled
for December, After that it will
ask that the Council of the Organi-
zation of American States be con-
voked for consultation on the matter.
