As indicated in the referenced memorandum, CCC feels

that the

memorandum dated 3 February 1961 and my. memorandim dated 21

February 1961) should not be utilized.

as a result of a conversation between Mr. Howard OSBORNE,

Deputy Chief, SR Division, and Mr. Jack SOÜTHARD, Chief, CCG/NC.

It should be noted at this point that SR Division plans to

process thirty or thirty-five REDSKIN Agents this year. Time
