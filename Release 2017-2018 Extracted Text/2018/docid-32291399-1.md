and possible contacts was furnished to Det. BRUMLEY to assist

him in the PD investigation.

then went to a newsstand at 1610 Commerce St. operated by HARRY

REMER URBAN, SR. (DL 162-143). LITTLE was observed in contact

with URBAN for about 8 minutes. He then drove to the Oak Cliff

section of Dallas, and after eating breakfast went directly

to his house trailer parked at 5500 South Beckley. He was in

the trailer for about ten minutes and after making stops at

two drugstores and the Oak Cliff Bank and Trust Company, drove

to 321 = 8th Street where he entered Apartment 101 in the

Natchez Apartments.

A check of the mail box indicated this

apartment is occupied by MARVIN COX.
