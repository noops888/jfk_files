ARCHIE NELSON and their respective lieutenants. Informant

stated he would make an effort to ascertain where such a

meeting place could be.

on May 22, 1962, PG I-39 advised:

From inquiries he has made as casually as possible among

minor racketeering figures

in the Pittsburgh area, he has

determined to his own satisfaction that the leading racketeering

figures in Western Pennsylvania meet occasionally in Rooms 39-40,

a bridal suite, at the Phoenix Motel, Monroeville, Pa.

GENOVESE, who is considered as the top lieutenant

in the JOHN

LA ROCCA

organization, has invited informant to attend a

gathering on Thursday

evening, May 24, 1962, at the Phoenix

Motel, and GENOVESE stated that the MANNARINOS and LA ROCCA

would

probably be present.

Informant has no idea of the

purpose of this or any other meeting.

On May 2, 1962, PG T-35 advised:

During the week before and the week after Easter, 1962,

SAMUEL, MANNARINO, ROMEO LENZI of Vandergrift,

Pa., met in the

21 Room of the Sea Gull Hotel, Miami Beach,

Florida, for the

purpose of discussing a

recent trend in which pollticians were

bypassing the top racket figures in favor of direct dealings

with the individual bookies.

They hoped, through their

discussion,

to come up with a way in which they could get

these politicians "back in line.

Informant is not aware of

the actual result of this discussion.

Gambling

On May 23, 1962, PG I-3 advised:

Currently, rumors are circulating among gamblers in the New

pa., area that the MANNARINOs have somehow

Keotten to Mayor EDWARD ZALESKI of New Kensington, Pa., and

that gambling will again flourish in the city in approximately

two

weeks.

These rumors are to the effect that the city will

be "re-opened" and that the craps, barbout, card and other

games will resume.

However, nobody seems to know as yet

whether these activities will take place at the former casino

located in

the Garibaldi Building, New Kensington, or at some

new location.

Miscellaneous

The April 7, 1962, edition of the "Daily Dispatch," a daily

newspaper published in New Kensington, Pa.,

carried an

article captioned "MANNARINO Las Vegas Link Cited."

This

article set out that on the preceding day MICHAEL MAC. DOUGALL,

that the "MANNARINO mob of New Kensington, Pa.," 1s

several racket combines having financial interests in Las

Vegas gambling casinos. He said that "gangsters"

such as

the MANNARINOs, remnants of the Detroit Purple Mob, Egan's

Rats from St. Louis, WILLIE MORETTI's mob, FRANK COSTELLO'S

men, and "Greasy" GUZIK's outfit, have pieces of some Las

Vegas casinos.

E.. LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISES

On April 25, 1962, PG I-39 advised:

Recently, MIKE GENOVESE stated that "the mob" is planning to

build a large motel in the Monroeville, Pa., area, but they

are having trouble with the zoning laws.

According to

GENOVESE, ARCHIE NELSON is the front man in connection with

this motel, but NELSON is being backed by the MANNARINOs and

the LA ROCCA groupo

On May 11, 1962, PG I-2 advised as follows:

On May 9, 1962, While at the Bonfire Restaurant, Route 58,

Leechburg, Pa.s

MANNARINO stated he was in "dire need of

moneyed friend in an effort to borrow money but had no

He said he recently flew to New York City with an

success MANNARINO claimed he had over $1,000,000 worth of

property but could not borrow anything on it.

He said he was

thinking of attempting to sell the restaurant and the property

where the Family Drive-In Theater was located.

MANNARINO

claimed the Ken Iron and Steel Company scrap metal business

In New Kensington was costing him too much to operate. He

complained that the scrap metal for which he had paid $40.00

per ton is now only selling for $20.00 per ton.

MANNARINO

indicated he would like to close down this operation for a while,

but he feared that he would get a much smaller price for an

inactive property should he convince the City of New Kensington

to buy ito

Informant suggested MANNARINO burn the place down,

and MANNARINO replied he had thought of it but knows that

PG 92-228

He has heard SAM MANNARINO attempting to convince drug store

owners and chain managers to install F & F Lozenges, using

the sales approach that these lozenges, which sell for 10¢

can be purchased for 5e while Life Savers cost 8¢ and only

sell for 10¢.

However,

the individuals MANNARINO has talked

to in Informant's presence are not enthusiastic about

accepting his product, and it would appear that this business

is not doing as well as MANNARINO had hoped.'

Recently, SAM

MANNARINO said that he was going to install

a golf driving

range at the road side on his tract of land near Route 58,

Allegheny Township, Westmoreland County, Pa.

F. PENDING PROSECUTIVE ACTION

There is no known pending prosecutive action against SAMUEL

MANNARINO at this time.

However, a Federal Grand Jury

continues to sit from time to time in Pittsburgh, Pa.,

conducting an inquiry into the activities of the MANNARINO

organization:
