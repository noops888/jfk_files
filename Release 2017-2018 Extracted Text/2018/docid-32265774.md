Interview:

Mrs. Hall was interviewed at her sister's home and stated

that on November 22, 1963 she was employed by E. Wills Fashion

Co. located at 501 Elm Street, fifth floor.

On the day prior

to the President's visit (November 21, 1963), two men came to

the factory and had a conversation with Mr. Ralph Leads, which

she overheard -- words to the effect that they were determining

the route of the motorcade.

Mrs. Hall was unable to state

whom the men represented.

On the morning of the 22nd of November, sometime between

9:30 and 10:30, Mrs. Hall states she glanced out of the window

(her sewing machine faced Houston Street and was near the

window) and observed an old type station wagon with writing on

it saying Honest Joe drive into Houston Street and park next

to the T.S.B.D. A young man (whom she believed to be a delivery

man) "got out and took a package about 5 feet long and 6 to 8:3

inches wide from.the car and entered the side door of the T.S B.D.

At this time, Mrs. Hall states she resumed her work and didn't

look out of the window until around lunchtime when she looked

across the street into the T.S.B.D.'s sixth floor window (their

sixth floor window was level with our fifth floor window") and

she saw a white male, wearing a hat, apparently looking for

something among boxes. She showed the man to her co-worker,

Gertrude Fowler, and a few minutes later they all went to have

lunch and watch the President's motorcade.

When the motorcade came by, Mrs. Hall states she heard

a bang; the President's hands went up towards his head, and

a cop fell off his motorcycle. Another bang and the President's

head went over. Jackie got out of the car onto the trunk; everyone

was screaming and running. "I thought I saw smoke coming from

the railroad. A lot of people ran to the railroad tracks,

including myself, but we turned around and went back to work.

At the factory there were plainclothes police. I told Mr.

Leads about the man

in the window across the street when I

heard someone say that the shots had come from the T.s.B.D.

Mr. Leads told

me to talk to the police and tell them what I

saw, which I did. Later we were all sent home."
