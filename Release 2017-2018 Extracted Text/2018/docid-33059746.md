Para-Military Intelligence Operations Against Viet Cong In South

Laos, South Vietnem, and North Vietnam; Commercial Air Cover Company:

The junk which departed for North Vietnam on a mission to

resupply an agent in the area of Quang Yen (northeast of Haiphong)

turned back because of bad weather and heavy seas. An attempt will

be made to resupply the agent as soon as weather conditions permit.

The agent team near Dien Bien Phu advised Saigon, using &

danger signal in a radio message, that it was under DRV control.

This is the second team of four originally infiltrated into North

Vietnam to be captured by the DRV. False instructions are being

radioed to the team Instructing them to prepare for a notional

airdrop.

The fiction is being attempted by Saigon in an effort to

keep the team

alive in the remote hope that the DRV might consider

the team has been doubled against the GVN and permit them to exfiltrate.

There has been no radio contact with the agent team in the Dong

Hoi area of North Vietnam since 2 December 1961.

Four agents who are residents of Pak Sane, Laos (near the Lao-

Thai border in Vientiene Province), have been recruited to infil-

trate overland into the Vinh area

of North Vietnam to observe and

report on military traffic along Route 7.
