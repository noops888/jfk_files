ISSUE_7 -- Certain Files of CIA Officials f
14. (S) This is a major request encompassing “... the

office files of the individual occupying the following positions
during the period 1959-1964.”

* The Office of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
¢ General Charles Cabell, 1953-1962
© General Marshall Carter, 1962-1965
« The Office of the Deputy Director for Plans :
* Richard Bissell, 1958-1965 Va
© Richard Helms, 1962-1965 eal
o\ the chronological files of C. Tracy Barnes, 1959-1964
© Office of General Counsel, Lawrence Houston, ‘1959-1964
© Operational Diaries of William Harvey, 1962-1963.

This request will by its very breadth require significant time on
the part of the directorate (and DCI) IROs. While it may appear
overly broad, we have developed a methodology with the ARRB staff
which provides the access required by the Board but guarantees
that their review is focused. In sum, we work from shelf lists
to narrow the selection and then conduct file review sessions
with the ARRB staff; if material requested is particularly
sensitive, access can be limited to the ARRB Executive Director
or members of the Board. This effort will continue for some
time.

Conclusion

15. (AIUO) At the present time, 32 persons are involved in
the JFK records review and we anticipate that this level of
effort will increase to 37 by May and to 40 thereafter as we near
the statutory end of the Board (30 September 1998). However,
even if the Board is not extended (and it has been extended
previously), there are statutory tasks for CIA which will extend
12-18 months beyond the end of the Board’s existence. Your
continued support is critical.

REFERENCE: Lotus note dated 8 May -- ARRB Meeting 12-13 May 1998

vy The JFK Board addressed six Agency issues at the 13 May meeting. The Agency's proposals prevailed in four of the six issues
-errone-and one issue was tabled for further discussion. The Board made the following determinations:

1) Alias Documentation and Accommodation Addresses:

accepted our proposal to postpone release of specific information until 2017 and use generic substitute language.

aL LITAMIL-9 [CIA penetration! considered a “key player” in the Oswald-Mexico

City story]: © pbcsncane

agreed to continue to protect the full crypt and delay the release of additional documents (201 file) until his death.
They set an annual review date on the documents; the Agency will need to advise NARA annually on his status.

agreed to protect true name and 201 file numbers of assets not previously released.
5) Mark Lane Item [extract from foreign document}:

document and ensure that it contains no other JFK assassination related information.

‘This was a very successful meeting from the Agency's perspective. The loss on Tepedino was not unexpected. Given what is
in the public domain, the Agency has not been able to make a persuasive argument to protect his name in the three years Tepedino has

been. performed using only Agency personnel and with their full
knowledge.

Recommendation (27)

In accordance with its present guidelines, the CIA should not
again engage in the testing of drugs on unsuspecting persons.

Recommendation (28) :
Testing of equipment for monitoring conservations should not
involve unsuspecting persons living within the United States.

B. Other Selected Activities of the Science and
Technology. Directorate

1. The Manufacture and Use of Documents

The Agency maintains a capability for producing and providing to
its agents and operatives a wide range of “alias” credentials. Most such
documents purport to be of foreign origin. Some, however, are docu-
ments ordinarily issued by other branches of the U.S. government or
by private United States businesses and organizations.

Amorig the United States “alias” documents furnished from time
to time to Agency personnel and operatives are Social Security cards,
bank cards, professional cards, club cards, alumni association cards
and library cards. The Agency has recently stopped producing alias
driver's licenses, credit cards and birth certificates, unless needed in
@ particularly sensitive operation and approved in advance by the
Deputy Director of Operations.

While the Ageney does not produce false United States passports,
it has in the past altered a few by the addition of entries to evidence
travel which had not actually occurred.

The purpose of alias documents is to facilitate cover during CIA
operations. These documents are not “backstopped,” i.e, manufac-
tured with the consent and knowledge of the company or organiza-
tion whose card is being manufactured. They are useful only as flash
identification. Only the Social Security Administration has been told
that the Agency is manufacturing its cards.

The Commission found no evidence that any Agency employee has
ever used false documentation of this kind to his personal advantage.

Conclusions

Alias credentials are necessary to facilitate CIA covert operations
overseas, but the striotpstycanterls nd accountability must be main-

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Executive Director

FROM: Lee S. Strickland
Chief, Information Review Group/OIM

SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues os
i ” 7

1. (AIUO) Per your request at our 1 April bi-weekly
meeting, we have summarized below the significant issues which
are under deliberation and negotiation with the JFK Board. Our
approach on protecting Agency equities is multi-step:

¢ First, with the staff, we argue relevance although the statute and
implementing regulations define “assassination records” very
broadly as including

© any records related to the assassination or Oswald,
* any records concerning the various conspiracy theories, and

* any records within the scope of previous investigations
including the Church Committee, Pike Committee, Warren
Commission, or House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA) ,*

¢ Second, with the staff, we argue that release would cause current
damage although the exemptions under the JFK statute are much
narrower than the corresponding exemptions under the FOIA, and

e Third, if we fail to convince the staff, we must proceed to a more
detailed and formal presentation to the Board.

1 (AIUO) It is the materials collected by the HSCA which are the most

numerous and often the most troublesome in terms of sensitive equities. They
are generally referred to as the “sequestered collection.”

2.  (S) Within records surfaced by the Ford Library is a

document -- a Helms Memorandum for the Record on a PFIAB meeting
_c=- which contains references to CIA\

oo (S) After much negotiation, the ARRB staff has agreed
to recommend to the Board that the information related to those
covert actions be considered non-related and the documents
designated “Not Believed Related” (NBR). The dgcument willibe
grouped with similar “NBR” documents and be presented to the ~
Board for final action at the 13 April or 12 May meeting.

ISSUE 2 -- Alias Documentation and Accommodation Addresses

4. (S) The CIA security file of former Agency employee,
David Morales (deceased -- true name already released), within
the sequestered collection contains documentation on five of his
alias.* We anticipate similar problems as we re-review other
security files within the sequestered collection. We are
considering a compromise with the following elements:

a
e protect all references to| |documents reflecting the alias
such as wa)

e release items designated as pocket litter such as club cards,

* protect elements of accommodation addresses to avoid identifying
specific locations, and

* lastly, make a decision to actually release or protect the alias
itself depending on the timeframe and its importance to the JFK
story.

5. (S) However, disagreements on the actual implementation
(e.g., protect house number but release street name of
accommodation address) have prevented a final resolution at this

,Whether the blanket release of pocket litter. (whether | on D

might present media or operational issues

today. Accordingly, we have requested that the issue be

postponed until the May meeting.

ISSUE_3 -- Organizational Materials

6. (8S) This request (one of the earliest and known as CIA-
1) asked for organization charts on various Agency direttorates
and/or components for the years 1958-1968. All-.Agency a
directorates provided material responsive to the request and the
ARRB staff has selected items for inclusion in the JFK
collection. Remaining at issue are three DO charts -- a 1961
generic DDP organization, a 1963 generic DDP organization, and a
detailed JMWAVE organization.‘ The DO has agreed to release the
first two and remain adamantly opposed to the release of the
JMWAVE chart given its similarity to current organizational
plans.

2 (S) This issue will be presented by ARRB staff to the
Board at the 13 April meeting where they will recommend that the
DDP generic charts be accepted (good for CIA) and that the JMWAVE
chart be declared as an assassination record (bad for CIA); an
actual vote by the Board will not take place until the May
meeting.

ISSUE 4 -- Mexico City Tapes

8.  (S) This request asked for a thorough search of Agency
files and documents for and CIA “... surveillance ‘take’ from
Cuban and Soviet facilities in Mexico City at the time of the
Oswald visit and in the immediate wake of the assassination.”
Among the items provided by the DO were five boxes containing
audio tapes from telephone taps on the Cuban and Russian
embassies and facilities. A number of the tapes are dated

SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues

22 November 1963; many others are dated 23 November 1963 .through
December 1963.°

9. (S) This is one of the most-complex requests because of
the following facts:

e at one time, there was a tape of Oswald in existence but it has
since been lost or erased;

« the relevance of these tapes is argued even though they do not
contain the Oswald conversation:® 7

° there is a confidential request from the ARRB||
for any (Copies of the actual? Oswald conversation they
may possess; and,

© quite obviously, the sensitivity is not so much the mere fact that
we possess such tapes but our release of the extent and actual
conversations captured.

10. (S) ° The good news, at least at this time, is that the
ARRB staff has agreed to postpone Board consideration until May
and, in the interim, the Agency will have an opportunity to
review (i.e., listen and transcribe) and determine the
sensitivity and provide. detailed arguments in this regard.

ISSUE_5 -- Protection of (LITAMIL-9 )

5 (s) The scope of this request is quite significant; it includes five boxes

of 185 tapes from operations against both the Cuban and Russian Embassy.
© (s) The ARRB staff position on the relevance of the tapes has three forms:
There could be conversations about Oswald and/or the assassination on the

22 Nov + tapes which could give clues to Oswald’s visit to Mexico City on

25 September - 3 October. The absence of any conversation about Oswald or the
assassination would itself be of historical interest. Or, there are
transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations that mention the
assassination in the collection and, thus, by definition, the tapes are
assassination records.
