OVERALL RATING: OUTSTANDING

At the end of May 1974, Mr. Murphy will leave

after a most successful six-year assiynment as

Chief of Station. He distinguished himself by having

molded this Station into a cohesive, well-di plined,
and highly productive unit. I reiterate my evaluation
of Mr. Murphy as, overall, the most effective chief of
a major station in the European Division. His earlier
fitness reports and his excellent record in
attest to this.

2. In the past year under Mr. Murphy's direction,
the Station has continued to make significant
progress on all major fronts. As examples, I can cite
two direct Soviet recruitment attempts, an imaginative
effort to get closer to several other primary Soviet
targets, a perceptible improvement in our
relationships, a marked increase in ‘both quality and
quantity of priority economic intelligence reporting,
the acquisition of new sources to cover the
internal scene, and a revitalization of several existing
assets into preducers of valuable intelligence. Although
normally most of the credit for such achievements rests
with the individual operations officers concerned, in
Mr. Murphy's case he personally becomes involved in cach

operation and therefore the cited progress isa direct
reflection of Mr. Murphy's talent and skill as eynaaic
operational manage is a sprawling metropolitan
area where operating ob3taéles, particularly those
relating to access to majertargets, are further exacerbated
by sporadic scrutiny of activities. It is
theretere all the more noteworthy that the pregress nade
by the Station has been accomplished without any eabar-
rassing flaps through Mr. Murphy's insistence that the
highest standards of tradecraft be practiced by Station
personnel and by visiting case officers.

My feeling that Dave_Yurphy has done aaloutstandinge 9. %
job as Chief of Station, is so amply documented in tha
preceding Fitness Reports that this final report before T
leave the Division need not be lengthily repetitive. Tt is
useful to record, however, that during the last half of this
year his Station has been deeply involved tn the reporting
and analysis of somo highly sensitive dovelepments onthe
political scene. Much of the analysis of this situa=
tion has been handled by Dave himself, and kas proven of real
significance to our highest level customers. We have briefed
of ranking offictals in shington on Dave's
and they have been uniformly appreciative, Dave
therefore doserves credit for alerting Washt ton to a difficult
situation concerning which the U.S, Government has had little
or no information oxcept from this Agency's sources.

Mr. Murphy's porformance continues to be Gutstanding.

be attributed to a reawakening on the part of the

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT
(For the period ending 31 March 1965)

SUBJECT: Mr, David E. Murphy

1. This report is the first full year report of Mr, Murphy's |
performance as Chief of the SR Division.

2. Perhaps his greatest contribution during thig past year has
been the energizing of the Division's several components with a
congequent very noticeable increase in the efforts of the Clandestine
Services as a whole against our Soviet targets, Mr, Murphy's
enthusiasm and imagination have been contagious, and we are ag
a result profiting from his sound approach to the role and mission
of his Division, He has fully understood the fact that the SR Division
cannot alone discharge the responsibilities of the Clandestine Services
for intelligence and counter-intelligence activity against our Soviet
requirements, but must harness the interest and the energies of all
the area divisions. In this reepect, Mr. Murphy is achieving nothing
short of remarkable success. His arrangements with DODS are also
improving the quality of that Division's work in the SR field, while
8 general administration of his Division from a managerial point of
view has continued to be excellent.

3. The overall evaluation of Mr, Murphy's performance during
this past year, including his regard for cost and manpower factors,
is outstanding. It is because of the quality of this performance that
favorable consideration has been given in principle to the gradual
investment of an increasing portion of the inanpower agsets of the
Clandestine Services to his Division. His plans and his accomplish-
ments todate justify confidence that these increases are being well
invested and will provide a maximum return,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT
(For the period ending 21 March 1964)

SUBJECT: Mr, David E, Murphy

1, Mr, Murphy relinquished hie dutica as Chicf, Eastern
Europe Division in September 1963 and took over his present respon-
sibilities as Chief of the SR Division at that time. This report covers
the period from I April.1963 tothe present and thus includes commente
on his performance as Chief, EE Division and Chief, SR Division.

2, Mr. Murphy combines an extraordinary talent for thia work

“with a considerable und varied experience in it. His previous report

indicated that he was turning in an outstanding performance in dealing
with the affairs of the EE Division, and he continucd this level of his
performance in the firat six months covered by this report, A general
reorganization of senior officers in the Clandestine Services offered
the opportunity to put Mr. Murphy in charge of the division which he
had long aspired to direct and for which position he was eminently
qualified, both lingulstically and by field experience. He ie showing
excellent results in refurbishing the Division and giving it new life

and impetus. His considerable energica enable him to give an out-
standing performance in managing and directing his Division's affairs
while at the same time engaging personally and most actively ina
number of very important Divisional cases. His competence includes
awareness of the need for keeping his costa down and getting the
maximum from his manpower. He is showing imagination and
initiative and is probably the best qualified and best prepared officer
ever to head the Division.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Fitness Report - Mr. David E, Murphy

1, This memoranduny is In lieu of the Fitness Report Form
on Mr. Murphy and covers the period from 1 April 192 through
31 March 1963, during which Mr, Murphy hae aerved as Chief
of the Eastern Europe Division.

After a long sérics of assignments dating from April 1948
and involving duty a Karleruhe ard Berlin where
he served as Chief of Base of that important inatallation, Mr.
Murphy returned to Headquartera in August 1961 ag Deputy Chief
of the EE Division and became Chief of that Division in June 1962.

I should like to quote from the fitness report on Mr. Murphy written
at the time he was assuming his new responsibilities 2a Chief of

EE Division: "There is every reason to believe that Mr, Murphy
will manage the EE Division in the same outstanding cnanner with
which he won the ungrudging respect of the Berlin community as

the leader of American intelligence in that area." A previous
Gituese report covering hig first year as Chief of Base, Berlin

is equally laudatory.

3, In hiv responsibility for etreamlining and iraproving the
efiectiveness of hia Division in both its headquarters aud overseas
postures, Mr. Murphy has been energetic and imaginative. He is
an authority on the gituation in West Germany but particularly in
Berlin and has played a highly useful role in government councils
on these problems, He has excellent working knowledge of Russian,
French and German, and hig operational experience as a result



of his field assignments is truly extensive,

4. In conducting the affairs of nis Division daring this
Past year, Mr, Murphy haa without question borne out the
prediction that he would tura in ao cutstanding performance,
He has done this and continues to do it.

Subject, tn my opinion, one gf the most valuable, versatile and
effective offleers tn @iS@8."% Te only weaknesses I have noted ‘in
Subject during the almost four years that I have been completely and
intimately familiar with hfs work on a daily basis, are a tendeney at
tines to be too impatient with other officers partteularly those who

do not begin to measure up to his very high standards of performance,
and an occasional tendency Lo be somewhat. undiplomatic {n his handling
of personnel. It should be clearly pointed out, however, that nelther
of these factors are of uuffictent importance or weight to, in any
material way, decrease the effectiveness of Subject's consistently fine
pecformanee. and are, in my opinion, merely the Inevitable corollary of
Subject's great drive and Intense dedication to his profeasion.” It
also should be pointed out that while Subject 1s an oxacting supervisor,
he is never unreasonable nor in any sense dictatortal, and he has demon—
strated the capacity of quickly developing and retaining the full
loyalty, cooperation and respect of the offteers wit whom he works,

It is, I think, stgnificant also that the respect which other officers
hold for Subject increases tn direct proportion to the level of pro-
fessional competence and experience which these officers attain,

In ascessing Subject's performance and capabilities, it should be
pointed out that he has been officially recommended for promotion
from grade G3-15 to grade G8-16 and that he has been officially recom.
mended to succeed the present incumbent as Chief of Base, BOB, Further
comments concerning Subject in this connection are contained in
EGBT-1004 dated 28 September 1958, the covering dispatch to this

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. David E, Murphy

SUBJECT : Service in the Clandestine Services
Records Committee

1. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you
for your service as a member of the CS Records Committee.
The contributions which you have made to our deliberations
have been of considerable assistance to me and to the CS
records program.

2. I believe that effective records and information
systems are vital to the success of an intelligence organi-
zation and that the Records Committee plays an extremely
important role in ensuring that these systems are consonant
with more pressing and dramatic operational and policy
requirements. The advice, assistance and participation
of yourself and other sentor officials have enabled us
to meet our obligations and make steady improvement in
this area. I hope I may continue to count on your sugges=
tions, initiative and advice in this area in the future.
