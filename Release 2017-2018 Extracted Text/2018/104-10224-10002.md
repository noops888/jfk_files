At the end of May 1974, Mr.

Murphy will leave

He distinguished himself by having

molded this Station into a cohesive, well disciplined,

and highly productive unit.

_Station has continued to make significant

progress on all major fronts.

As examples, l can cite

two direct Soviet recruitment attempts, an

imaginative

effort to get closer to soveral other primary sovict

targets, a perceptible improvement in

our

relationships,

marked increase in both quality and

quantity of priority economic intelligence reporting.

the acquisition of new sources to

cover the

internal

and a revitalization of several existing

assets into producers of valuable intelligence.

of this officer's competence as one

superb performance.

Mr. Murphy shows a lively

impatience with bureaucratic

roadhlocks and cogently

articulates his views on all issues

his correspondence

with Headquarters is invariably presented

and unemotional tone: this !

Mr. David k. Murphy

1. This report covers the performance of Mr. Murphy

as Chief of the SR Division for the past gear.

The past year has seon a measurable increase in the

wurk load of the SR Diviston, with no let up in the energetic efforts

of the Division to accomplish its mission.

A number of new E

operations have come into being and the support rendered the

Division by the other area divisions has been a reflection of the

success of Mr. Murphy's program to enlist the interest and the

energies of the other area divisions in arracking one of our principal

Mr. Murphy has now assumed era responsibilities as

chief of a substantially enlarged division including the satellites

as well as the Soviet Union. This is a tridure to his own outstanding

management of his diviaion as well as a recognition of the close

operational interrelationship between Serie! and satellite activities.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT

(For the period ending 31

March 1965)

SUBJECT: Mr. David E. Murphy

1. This report is the first full year report of Mr. Murphy's

performance as Chief of the SR Division.

2. Perhaps his greatest contribution during this past year has

been the energizing of the Divigion's several components with a

congequent very noticeable increase in the rfforts of the Clandestine

Services as a whole against our Soviet targets. Mr. Murphy's

enthusiasm and imagination have been contagious, and we are as

a result profiting from his sound approach to the role and mission

of his Division.

He has fully understood the fact that the SR Division

cannot alone discharge the responsibilities of the Clandestine Services

for intelligence and counter-intelligence activity against our Soviet

requirements, but must harnesg the interest and the energies of all

the area divisions. In this respect, Mr. Murphy is achicving nothing

short of remarkable success. His arrangements with DODS are also

improving the quality of that Division's work in the SR field, while

his general administration of his Division from a managerial point of

view has continued to be excellent.

3. The overall evaluation of Mr. Murphy's performance during

this past year, including his regard for cost and manpower factors,

is outstanding. It is because of the quality of this performance that

favorable consideration has been given in principle to the gradual

investment of an increasing portion of the inanpower assets of the

Clandestine Services to his Division. His plans and his accomplish-

ments to date justify confidence that these increases are being well

invested and will provide a maximum return,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF ANNUAL FITNESS REPORT

(For the period ending 31 March 1964)

SUBJECT: Mr. David E. Murphy

1. Mr. Murphy relinquished hie duties au Chicl, Eastern

Europe Division In Siptember 1963 and took over his present respon-

sibillties as Chief of the SR Division at that time. This report coverg

the perlod (rom l' April 1963 to the pregent and thua includes commente

in bio performance is Chief, EE Division and Chief, SR Division.

2. Mr. Murphy combines an extraordinary talent for this work

with a considerable and varied experience in it. His previoue report

indicated that he was turning in an outstanding performance in dealing

with the affairs of the KE. Division, and he continued this level of his

performance in the firat aix months covered by this report. A general

reorganization of sentor officers in the Clandestine Services offered

the opportunity to put Mr. Murphy in charge of the dividion which he

had long aspired to direct and for which position he was eminently

qualified, both lingulatically and by field experience. He le ghowing

excellent results in refurbishing the Diviaion and giving it new life

and impetus.

His considerable energies enable him to give an out

standing performance in managing and directing his Division's allairg

while at the same time engaging personally and most actively in a

number of very important Divisional cases.

His competence includes

awareness of the need for keeping his costs down and getting the

maximum from hia manpower.

He is ghowing imagination and

initiative and is probably the best qualified and best prepared officer

ever to head the Division.

1. This memorandum is In lieu of the Fitness Report Form

on Mr. Murphy and covere the period from 1 April 1962 through

31 March 1963, during which M°. Murphy hay served as Chief

of the Eastern Europe Division.

2. Alter a long serice of assignmente dating fourn April 1948

and involving duty at

1 Karloruhe ard Berlin where

he served as Chief of Base of that important inatallation, Mr.

Murphy returned to Headquarters in August 1961 as Deputy Chief

os the EE Division and became Chief of that Division in June 1962.

I should like to quote from the fitness report on Mr. Murphy written

al the time he was aasuming his now responoibilities as Chief of

EE Division: "Thore is every reason to believe that dir. Murphy

will manage the EE Division in the same outstanding manner with

which he won the ungrudging respect of the berlin coramunity as

the leader of American Intelligence in that area." A previous

tiness report covering his firet year as Chief of Base, Berlin

is equally laudatory.

In his responsibility for streamlining and iraproving the

electiveness of hie Divinion in both its headquarters and overseas:

postures, Mr. Murphy has been energetic and imizinative. Heis

an authorite on the situation in West Germany but particularly in

Berlin and has played a highly useful role in government councile

en these problems. He has excellent working kansledge of Russian,

French and German, and hia operational experience as a resule

prediction that he would turn in an outstanding performance.

He has done this and continues to do it.

Intimately famillar with his work on a dally basta, are a tendency

at

impatient with other officers particularly those who

do not begin lo measure up to his very high standarde of performance,

and an occasional tendency to be somewhat undiplomatic in his handling

of personnel.

It should be clearly pointed out, however, that nelther

of these factors are of sufficient importance or weight to, in any

material way, decrease the effecilveness of Subject's conuistently fine

performance. and are, in my opinion, merely the inevitable corollary of

Subject's great drive and intense dedication to his profession. It

also should be pointed

out that while Subject is an exacting supervisor,

he is never unreasonable nor in any sense dictatorial, and he has demon

strated the capnelty of quickly developing and rotalning the full

loyalty, cooperation and respect of the

officers alth whom he worko.

It 10, I think, signifleant also that the respect, which other officers

hold for Subject Increases in direct proportion in the level of pro-

fessional competence and experience which these officers attain.

In assessing Subject's pertormance and capabilities, it should be

pointed out that he has been officially recommended for promotion

from grade G3-15 to grade GS-16 and that he has been officially recom-

mended to succeed the present incumbent as Chief of Base, BOB. Further

comments concerning Subject in this connection are contalned in

EGBT-100% dated 28 September 1958, the covering dispatch to this

Pitness Report, which should be read in conjunction therealth.
