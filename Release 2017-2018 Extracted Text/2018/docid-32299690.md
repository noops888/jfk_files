Rome 92-68

Rome cable dated 11/12/63 reported information

received from JAMES J: WAGNER, Immigration and Naturalization

(INS) representative in Rome, who was in Genoa, Italy, on a

road trip.

WAGNER stated a fairly reliable source informed

him on 11/12/63 that BRUNO met JOE ADONIS in Milan, Italy,

about three to five days previous and might be either in

Milan or Venice, Italy. #Furnished with this information,

Doctor MANOPULO

and realerted police authorities in Venice regarding BRUNO'S

possible presence there.

Doctor MANOPULO said to date no

information has been received indicating BRUNO is in these

cities. 3G-+ (u)

Doctor MANOPULO has requested Italian police in

Sicily to locate and interview CUMELLA and CALOGERO SINATRA,

BRUNO'S uncle and cousin, in an effort to determine BRUNO'S

current location. G-Ilu)

*As the Bureau has been informed, Italian police

interviewed PAT MASSI who stated BRUNO departed for the U.S. (G][a)

on 11/10/63 .**Subsequent investigation has failed to verify

BRUNO'S departure from Italy and, accordingly?

Legat is

proceeding on the assumption that BRUNO is still in Italy.

We are continuing to press this matter vigorously. All

stops are being maintained and intensive coverage continues fC4(m)

Upon the receipt of any pertinent information concerning

BRUNO'S current location, Bureau will be advised by expeditious

means.

For the Bureau's information, Italian authorities

do not record the arrival of an individual nor do they have

a record of the individual's departure from Italy, This

practice was abolished about eighteen months ago.

The

Italian Government does, however, require all foreigners to

exhibit their passports

when they

take lodging at a hotel,

rooming house, or pensione.

Pertinent information is ex-

tracted and forwarded to the Foreigners Office In Rome, Italy. (61)(u)

In the case of ANNALORO, special precautions have

been taken to flag his departure from Italy. Pertinent data.

concerning subject has been furnished to all sea ports and

airports, and should subject attempt to leave Italy, this

office has arranged to be advised by expeditious means:

the Bureau is aware, the Rome Office has not received any

Information from Italian police which would indicate ANNALORO

has taken lodging at a public place in Italy since October,

1963. It can be assumed, therefore, that if subject in fact

is in Italy, he is lodging at a private residence with

friends possibly under an

assumed name. 1) (e)

The Rome Office, through the Central Bureau,

Criminal Division,

Italian National Police, home, nas

alerted

all police districts to

be on the lookout for subject and,

in addition, airports at Fiumicino, Rome, and Malpensa, Milan,

and sea ports in Naples and Genoa have also been alerted

regarding subject.

It would seem logical, therefore, that

should the Rome Office receive information that subject is

at a departure point in Italy about to depart for the U.S.,

we should permit him to depart for the U. S. where he can be

arrested on arrival rather than taking the circuitous route of

having Italian police detain him in order that a representa-

tive of the U.S. Embassy, Rome, can limit his passport for

direct and immediate return to the U. S. In this connection,

as was set forth in Rome cable of 11/1/63, Doctor ARISTIDE

MANOPULO, Central Bureau, Criminal Division, Italian Nationa.

should ANNALORO'S

fuse to leave Italy and the Italian Government cannot compel

him to leave as this would be extradition in disguise ]4-1)(4)
