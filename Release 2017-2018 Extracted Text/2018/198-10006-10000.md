Considerations for Ul folloy Toward

Cube and Iatin Anerlea

I. US POLICY OBJECTIVES

1. Us policy toward Latin Amerion la to Increase the

stability of the area, to strengthen friendly democratic

goverments, and to prevent the establishment of Castroite

and anti- 03

regines.

None of these seen attainable so long

as Castro, with Boviet support, rules in Cuba. Accordingly,

the most Immediate US objoctive in Cube In the replacement

of the Castro-Communist regime by one compatible with the

goals of the United States. Current U8 polloy in pursuance

of this objective is to leolate Cuba from the Western Homi

sphere and the rest of the free World and to exert maxmun

possible pressures, short of open and direct US military

of the Castro-Communist rogine.

the CIs covert action pro

gram is designed to support other governmental measures to

proliferate and intensily the pressures on Castro; 1ts

ultimate purpose la to encourage diamident elements, particu-

larly in the military, to carry out a coup and eliminate

Castro and the Soviet

presence In cuba.

II. PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVEB

2.

The situation in Cuba Is characterized by econonie

atagnation, depresed living conditions, the 108s of

revolutionary impetus, and the dialllusloment of an in

creasingly large majority of the population.

To some extent

this 1s a result of innate econone deflolenotes in Cube,

and nore recently, hurrienne flora; but ton considerable

extent, the probio contronting the castro regina have been

magnifled by Chatro's own ineptitude and by the Ua policy of

econome and politloal isolation, and other barassment and

sabotago measures. Castro's position apponre to be eroding

gradually and recently he has been forced to sdopt Increasingly

harsh messures to maintain his control. "e bollove that a

continuation of prement US polley over the nort 18 to 84

months will produce a mubutantial further deterioration In

the cuban economy and In Cuban morale, with consequent

seTIous Inpisestions for Castro's position. But U8 pressures

must be inteneified 11 the deteriorsting altustion v1thin

cuba 1e to result 1n

the overthrow of the Castro rogime in

the foreseeable future.

Despite whatever problen he has been having in

Cuba (or perhaps because of then), Castro has recently Intent-

11ad setiona ained at fomenting violence, subversion and

revolution throughout Latin America.

Given stable political

conditions in thin region, Cantro's limited subversive cap

bilitles would pose no immediate threat to US interests.

But sinco political conditions are highly fragile in many

Latin American countrios, the threat from Cautro le real and

disproportionate to his oms meager assets.

his urgent need

to sohleve some early triumph has impelled him to shake off

his recent caution as evidenced by the Cuban arms cache dig

covered in Venezuela, his sall for violent revolutionary

action to take place in Peru, Brasil, and Panams, 1n December,

and his threat to cut off support from his followerm in other

countries unlens they initiate carly action.

While we bolleve

that these actiona are evidence of some demperation and that

they may even baokfire, they nevertheless demon-trate Castro's

determination to pursue an all out campaign of revolution.

The key questions then, are bow wich time does Castro have

and, in this time, can

he set dangerous revolutionary fires

throughout the hemisphere. A corollary question Is whether

present US polley vial-vis Cuba and Latin America neote

present Us requirements. Our view is that the pace is slow.

and 1e allowing Castro a dangerous latitude in bin Latin

American program of subversion and revolution.

We belleve

that Cantro's recent activities in latin America now provide

us with our opportunity to pursue a nore openly aggressive

retallation approach against the Cantro rogime, both unflaterally

as well an in collaboration with the countries of the OAS for

joint action designed to remove Castro.

III. COURSES OF ACTION

Cuba.

might reflect on the good lalth of the President and the

credibility of future UB discussiong with high Soviet officials.

On the other hand,

Mikoyan asserted that "Cuba was too small

to subvert anyone;" clearly demonstrable evidence that Castro

CIA'e Intograted Covert Action ProvTa

Toward Cuba, approved by bigher authority in mid.

June 1063, condiata of the following interdependent

courses of action and has ande progreas as indicated

operational requirembnts - covert collection

weapon and a atimulus to resistance.

Binoe the

(Santa Lucla - Casilda • Il Inabela - Cayo Guin).

Three additlonal were ready to go, but for

several reasons including "eather, "ere recalled

at the last minute.

While it in recognized that

no single act of aabotage will materially affect

economy, we belleve these ambotage raide have

had a significant cumulative effect and should be

continued.

We belleve the recent rise in internal

sabotage and increased disaffection and demoraltza-

tion in the armed forces are partly due to the

impact of these externally mounted sabotage raide.

(6) Support of autonomous anti- Cantro Cubau

to supplement and anaint in the executo

oi the above course of action - in order to expand

sabotage and resistance activities it has become

necessary to accept the laka Involved in utilizing

autonomous Cuban exile groups and individuals who

will not necessarily be responsive to our guidance.

the program and we expect the firat infiltration

unduly basardous operational condition around theme

installatione for maritime raide and concern over the

political repercussions of the capture of comndos

sent on theme missions, have militated againat mounting

wuch raida.

Moreover,

the effectivo dange that can be

done to theme heavily defended targets by mall tears

now used covertly la problematical. A number of these

targets, however, can be effectively attacked from the

air under acceptable risk conditions. We, therefore,

propose the following:

(1) Relaxation of the present policy bannluy

(2) Authorization to couduct CIA or autononous

group controlled nir trikes againat selected major

economic targets such as the pover plante and ofl

refineries in the Havana, Matanzas, and Santiac

aress of Cuba.

Our Station In Miami reports that exile conserva...

tives were depressod because they interpreted this passage

as U.S. willingness to accept "Fideliano without Fidel,

while leftlet oriented groups were encouraged to believe

that "anti-Communist progressive and revolutionary elements"

have the support of the U.S. Government. These Cuban

exile reactions, however, cannot be taken as reflecting

the views of people inside Cuba.

It la typical of extles

that they become oversensitive to the innuendoes of

official public statements bearing upon their problems,

Within Cuba, we belleve that President Konnedy's statement

probably contributed significantly to providing

political

assurances to the rolatively small number of potential

coupsters to whom these remarke are addressed.

But we

believe that action may be expected to follow only when

theo assurances are coupled with open recognition fron

authoritative U.S. spokesmen that many Cubans now servine

in" the ermed forces and other power centers of the Cratro

regime will have to play a major role in its overthrow.

These people need to be assured that the United Staten

sympathetic to the personal problems they will face in the

event of a succeseful coup.

To meet this and reiated

problens, we recommend that the following passages be

siven some

prominence in a Presidential prees conference,

declaration or speech at the earliest appropriate occaolor:

"There are many in the ranke of the Cubai

armed foroes, and in the Cuban Government itself,

who have viewed with sorrow and anger the

"To these men I say the United States is

ready to welcome to discussion without rancor

and without reprisal a non-Communist Cuban

leadership which truly represents the will of

the Cuban people to strike down the barrier

American republics.

We recognize that many

non- Communist Cubans who now appear to be a

the machinery of tyranny, will ulti

mately be instruments in destroying it and

for this reason should be entitled to special

conslderation."

The President may also wish to refer to a speech

celebrating the

return of the Brigade menbers delivered by

President Kennedy at the Orange Bowl on 29 December 1902

at which tine he declared:

"Under the Allanza pare el Progreso, we
