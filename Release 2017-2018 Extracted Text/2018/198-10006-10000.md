MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
THROUGH: — Deputy Director (Intelligence)

SUBJECT: Considerations for US Policy Toward
Cuba and Latin America

I, US POLICY OBJECTIVES

1. US policy toward Latin America is to increase the
stability of the area, to strengthen friendly democratic
governments, and to prevent the establishment of Castroite
and anti-US regimes. None of these seem attainable so long
as Castro, with Soviet support, rules in Cuba. Accordingly,
the most immediate US objective in Cuba ia the replacement
of the Castro-Communist regime by one compatible with the
goals of the United States. Current UB policy in pursuance
of this objective is to isolate Cuba from the Western Hemi-~
sphere and the rest of the Free World and to exert maximum
possible pressures, short of open and direct US militar:
intervention, to prevent the cpasolidation and” gtabilizetion
of the Castro-Commnist regime. The CIA covert action pro-
gram is designed to gupport other governmental measures to
proliferate and intensify the pressures on Castro; its
ultimate purpose is to encourage dissident elements, particu-
larly in the military, to carry out a coup and eliminate
Castro and the Soviet presence in Cuba.

II. PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVES

2. The situation in Cuba is characterized by economic
atagnation, depressed living conditions, the logs of
revolutionary impetus, and the disillusionment of an in-
creasingly large majority of the population. To some extent
this is a result of innate economic deficiencies in Cuba,
and more recently, Hurricane Flora; but to a considerable
extent, the problems confronting the Castro regime have been
magnified by Castro's own ineptitude and by the US policy of
economic and political isolation, and other haragsment and
sabotage measures. Castro's position appears to be eroding
gradually and recently he has been forced to adopt increasingly
harsh meagures to maintain hig control. We believe that a
continuation of present US policy over the next 18 to 24
months will produce a substantial further deterioration in

HW 50955 Docld:32423815 Page 2


SECRET °

&

the Cuban economy and in Cuban morale, with consequent
serious implications for Castro's position. But US pressures
must be intensified if the deteriorating situation within
Cuba is to result in the overthrow of the Castro regime in
the foreseeable future.

3. Despite whatever problems he has been having in
Cuba (or perhaps because of them), Castro hag recently intensi-
fied actions aimed at fomenting violence, subversion and
revolution throughout Latin America. Given stable political
conditions in this region, Castro's limited subversive capa-
bilities would pose no immediate threat to US interests,
But since political conditions are highly fragile in many
Latin American countries, the threat from Castro is real and
disproportionate to his own meager agsets. His urgent need
to achieve some early triumph has impelled him to shake off
his recent caution as evidenced by the Cuban arms cache dis~
covered in Venezuela, his call for violent revolutionary
action to take place in Peru, Brazil, and Panama, in December,
and his threat to cut off support from his followers in other
countries unless they initiate early action. While we believe
that these actions are evidence of some desperation and that
they may even backfire, they nevertheless demonstrate Castro's
determination to pursue an all-out campaign of revolution,
The key questions then, are how much time does Castro have
and, in this time, can he set dangerous revolutionary fires
throughout the hemisphere. A corollary question is whether
present US policy vis-a-vis Cuba and Latin America neets
present US requirements. Our view is that the pace is slow
and is allowing Castro a dangerous latitude in hig Latin
‘American program of subversion and revolution. We believe
that Castro's recent activities in Latin America now provide
us with our opportunity to pursue a more openly aggressive
retaliation approach against the Castro regime, both unilaterally
as well ag in collaboration with the countries of the OAS for
joint action designed to remove Castro.

III, COURSES OF ACTION

A. Invasion

4. A successful invasion of Cuba would provide the most
direct, simplest, and expeditious way of removing Castro.
This courge has been shunned up to now largely because of
concern for world reactions and the possibility of escalation
into global war with the Soviet Union, which is at least
morally committed to defend the Castro regime. However,
geveral new factors have become apparent gince the gaing and
costs of an invasion course were last thoroughly examined over

5. Rogardleas of any of theso recent Gevelopmenta, wa
mot recognize that an invasion of Cuba carries great rigk
of a US-Soviot confrontation (probably in Berlin rather than
Cuba), Tho risk of such ® confrontation vould bo less 4” an
invasion vas clearly a result of a unanimous OAS decision
and if tho invading. forces were Gonuinmoly multilateral in
composition than if the attack on Cuba vas etrictly a uni-~
lateral US action, In fact, anything more than a unilateral
UB action, even though substantially leap than an OAS action,
would take some of the edge off tho risks implicit in an
iuvasion. Tho rigk of confrontation would be substantially
lesa if multilateral OAS action wore coupled with unreat
ingide Cuba leading to a coup. in any case, however, the
Ui would pro) y atep ip Poneions Sharply in Berlin and
we should be prepared for straing among our NATO allies.
This will be especially true if the invasion were undertaken
without prior NATO consultation.

6. Finally, 1t should be noted that the President told
Mikoyan on 26 November that tho US was not planning to invade
Cuba. A US invasion in the face of the President's remarks
might reflect on the good faith of the President and the
credibility of future US discussions with high Soviet officials,
On the other hand, Mikoyan asserted that "Ciba was too small
to subvert anyone;" clearly demonstrable evidence that Castro
was, in fact, engaging in subversion would provide sufficient
justification to warrant a reversal of any commitment, explicit
or implicit, that wag made to Mikoyan, If an invasion were
an OAS affair, (or even undertaken by several Latin American
countries who were conspicuous targets of Castro's subversive
activities) so much the better.

B. Blockade
- A complete and successful blockade of Cuba, including

7
all Soviet Bloe shipping, could be expected to bring a
Castro from within, short of an actua mvasion. Such 4 move,

HW 50955 Docld:32423815 Page 4


X

se

in the abecace ef an agtual declaration of war, would almost
certainly result in e gabetantial reaction against the
bleckaders (whether the US alone or the OAS in tts entirety)
and considerable ©) ition even among our closest allies in
Western Europe, eapecially if it were a prolonged blockade.
The international reaction a je wou! prol y
reduced if the bicckade wore:

a. Selective (i.e., limited to POL and
munitions);

b. A quarantine of covert shipments of
ares, equipment, and personnel between Cuba
and ae America (seo paragraph 11 B (1)
below).

ec. An operation in which there were very
substantial participation by other OAS countries;

d. An action following a clear and convincing
case that Castro was engaged in subversion through-
out Latin America.

e. Of short duration and resulted in the
overthrow of the Castro regime from within.

8. Ags in the cage of an invasion, Soviet reaction will
probably be more likely to take place in Berlin (where their
strategic pogition ig as favorable to them ag ours in Cuba
ig to us), Thus, if this course were pursued, it should be
done recognizing that a counterblockade of Berlin and
incidents involving Soviets ships in Cuban waters will almost
certainly be an immediate consequence.

C. Actions Short of Invasion of Complete Blockade

9, Both an invasion and a blockade are high-risk actions
which would represent & major change not only in our Cuban
policy, but in our international policy as well. For this
reason, domestic political as well as the broadest strategic i
military and foreign policy considerations would be involved.
There are, however, certain courses of action which could
be directed against Castre in Cubs and Latin America which
are less risky than either an invasion or blockade, but would
involve a substantially higher "noise level" and risk of con-
frontation with the Soviets than those presently in effect.
Some of these have been considered in the past, but have been
rejected, usually either on grounds of excessive risk or lack
of feasibility, We believe it is now appropriate te reconsider

theme and ether actions designed to step up the intensity
and pace of overt and covert actions whose purpose is to
bring about the downfall of the Castro regige in the fore—
seeable future. The status of current programs and recom
aendations for future action are discussed below.

CIA Activities

A. CIA'e Integr

ted Covert Action Program

‘foward Cuba, approved by higher authority in mida-
June 1583, congistsa of the following interdependent
courgea of action and has ande progreas a8 indicated
below:

(1) Covert collection of intelligence, both
for US strategic requirements ag well as for
operational requirea¥nts - covert collection
of intelligence utilizes all collection techniuues
both within Cuba as well as against Cuban inate] la-
tiong and pereonnel abroad. The quantity and
quality of this intelligence continues to improve,
although etill far from our goals.

(2) Propaganda actions to stiaulate low-risk
simple sabotage and other forums of active and
passive resistance - ClA-controlled radio programs
and other propaganda media directed at Cuba en-
courage low-risk eimple sabotage and other forss
of active and passive resistance. These media
also seek to stimulate and exacerbate tensions
within the regime and between Cuba and the
Soviet Blédt, taking advanteae of Sino-Soviet
tensions. The program includes both mailing
and radio operations,

(3) Eoonomic denial actions - governaent-wide
overt official UB economic sanctiona in conjunction
with covert economic denial operations are causing a
marked adverse effect on the Cuben economy.

(4) Bxploitation and stimlation of disaf-
fection in the Cuban military and other power
centers - we are undertaking an intensive probing
effort to identify, seek out, and establish
channels of communication with disaffected and
potentially dissident non-Commun ist elements in
the power centers of the regime, particularly in
the armed forees hierarchy. The objective is to
stisulate an internal coup which would dislodge
Castro ané his entourage. We curreatly are in
direct contact with eral individuals inside Cuba
who may be ef Augpid. mee for this progran.

-b-

ca

Seay =

(5) General sabotage and harasament — .
sabotage in this program ig both an economic
weapon and a stimulus to resistance. Since the
approval of the program, four externally
mounted sabotage operations have been succeseful
(Santa Lucia - Cagilda - La Isabela — Cayo Guin).
Three additional were ready to go, but for
several reasons including weather, were recalled
at the last minute. While it is recognized that
no single act of sabotage will materially affect
the economy, we believe these sabotage raids have
had a significant cumulative effect and should be
continued,

We believe the recent rise in internal
sabotage and increased disaffection and demoraliza—
tion in the armed forces are partly due to the
impact of these externally mounted sabotage raids,

(6) Support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban
groups to supplement and assist in the execu toa
ot the above course of action - in order to expand
wabotage and resistance activities it has become
necessary to accept the risks involved in utilizing
autonomous Cuban exile groups and individuals who
will not necessarily be responsive to our guidance,
Substantial progress ig being made in this part of
the program and we expect the first infiltration
and sabotage operations to begin in mid-January.

B, Suggestions for Inte: ification of Covert Action
Programe Directed Against Cuba. As “atated above, the ~~
primary objectiv ‘the covert action program is to
create conditions and exploit all opportunities which
could lead to a coup againat the Castro regime.. Under
the program approved in mid-June 1963, we have adequate
policy latitude and we are now making maximum use of
CIA's resources to pursue our operations, In our
Judgment, however, the category of gabotage and harags—
ment should be intensified, at least for the next
year, both as to quantity and quality, if the overall
program is to have a chance of producing the desired
results, With regard to quantity, the pelicy decision
to ban non-CIA sponsored exile raids from US and
Bahaman territory bas given CIA a virtual monopoly in
thie field, but it has algo drastically reduced the

Rees

HW 50955 Docld:32423815 Page 7


number of raids against Cuba. With regard to quality,
we have long recognised the importance of incapacitating
the critical power Plants and o11 refineries in the
Havana, Matanzas, and Santiago areas of Cuba. But

political repercussions of the capture of commandos
gent on these miesions, have mailitated against mounting
such raids. Moreover, the effective damage that can be
done to these heavily defended targets by small teana
now uged covertly ig problematical. A number of these
targets, however, can be effectively attacked from the
air under acceptable risk conditions. We, therefore,
propoge the following:

(1) Relaxation of the present policy banniupy
all independent (non-CIA controlled or sponsored)
Cuban exile maritime raids and air strikes Bgeinat
targets in Cuba from Us and urge the British to do
likewise for Bahaman territory.

(2) Authorization to conduct CIA or autonomoun
group controlled air Strikes agningt selected ina jor
economic targets such as the power plants and oil
refineries in the Havana, Matanzas, and Santiaga
areas of Cuba,

11. Action by Other Governmental Agenci Suppor ted
by CIA as Kppro a4 e. Unless all govermee: agencies accord
the highsat Teeeee of priority and urgency to bringing about
the downfall of the Castro regime, an intensification of the
covert action program alone is not likely to achieve the
desired result, Accordingly, we recommend that the following
proposals be given renewed emphasis or be initiated Af not

already in effect:
A. Actions Against Cube
(1) It 16 urged that President Johnson make a policy

and

in the armed forces to carry out a coup. Same suggestions
for a Presidential statement to further this objective
are contained in Tab A attached,

Sa
27s:

ae

Nw 50955 Docld:32423815 Page 8


(2) By an interplay of diplomatic preasure and
political warfare to cause the Kremlin leadership to
conclude that disengagesgent fron its overextended and
precarious position in Cuba would be in the best
Soviet interest, The President and his representatives
cap put the Soviets on notice via @iplomatiec channels
and in private confidential discussion that US
rapprochement with Castro is excluded from consideration,
and that the existence of the Castro regime is a serious
impediment to detente with the USSR. The US could offer
to assist the Soviets in finding a face-saving way to
withdraw gracefully trom Cuba without serious loag-term
damage to its prestige, a technique already successfully
applied during the missile crisis of Gctober 1962. CIA
could support this effort by covert political and deception
operations to exacerbate existing tensions between Castro
and the Soviets by causing Castro to believe that the
Soviets are engaged in secaet negotiations with the US
to climinate him.

(3) There is still considerable opportunity for
tightening the economic nooge around Castro if the Us
ig prepared to incur the temporary displeasure of certain
allies and neutral countries. More severe US sanctions
against countries that trade with or ship to Cuba could
be imposed. We are particularly concerned with tse current
trade and shipping practices of Canada, the UK, Spnin,
and Japan,

(4) UB military feints could be undertaken designed
to create and maintain a high state of anxiety within
the Castro regime regarding US intentions. Supported by
covert political and deception operations these feints
would cause frequent Cuban military alerts and constant
movement of Cuban forces throughout the island.

(5) Initiation of frequent low level reconnaissance
flights would provide additional useful intelligence on
Cuban and Soviet military movenents, These flights would
also have a positive peychological effect ingide Cuba in
demonstrating US contempt for Castro in a vigible and
dramatic manner.

B. Actions in Latin Amezica. As Castro's domestic position
deteriorates, he La likely, In desperation, to become increasingly
ruthless and reckless in fomenting subversion, violerce, and
revolution in Latin America, It thus becomes @specially import
ant to make certain that Castro does not outflank US efforts by

allowing him a major success somewhere in Latin America
such ag he hag sought to achieve in Venesuela.

It would be unrealistic to expect auch in the way
of militant or aggressive action against Castro from the
OAS or most of the individual Letin American countries strong
enough or so geographically loeated as to wake any significast
contribution. But the vulnerability of OAS countries to
Castro's subversive activities provides all the more reason
for an OAS that has the substance as well ag the forms of an
alliance. For this reason we would place high on the liat of
US actions » move to revitalize the GAS. Although many of
the actions listed beléw could be undertaken unilaterally by
the US, a coordinated OAS approach would not only increase
their effectiveness, but reduce their risk. In cases where
it is imposgible to get wholebearted and uganimous partici-
pation by the OAS, it sheuld be our guiding priaciple to
bring ag many Latin American countries as possible along
with us, by bilateral agreements if neceesary.

The following actions with respect to Latin America
are espentially defensive in the senge that they are designed
to thwart Castro's subversive efforts in this region. We
assume that they will be acgompanied by long-term programs
to build up the stability and streagth of friendly Latin
American regimes:

(1) Perhaps tke most important action the US
could take to igolate Cuba from Latin America and
ingulate these countries from Cuban subversion efforts
ie to quarantine covert arms, equipment, and personnel
shipments by air or sea from Cuba to Latin America.
For maximum effect, the eordon, preferably sanctioned
by and participated in by the OAS, should be drawn as
close to Cuban shores as ia tactically possible. It
gust be recognized that this quarantine would sot be
felly effective, but it would provide a legal basis
for meiming and searching Cuban, and, if necessary
non-Cuban, vessels and aircraft at will to determine
whether they are engaged in running arma, equipment, ~
and mea to Latin America.

(2) Early recognition of the Dominiean and
Honduran goverments would assist our efferts against
Castro. Two strongly anti-Cagtre governments would
be added te the support of the US in the O48 and
additional Caribbean bases for operations against
Castro would becene available.

(3) Appropriate Latin American countries should
be encouraged to offer support and agsietance, including
bases, to responsible Cuban exile groups to permit them
to operate against Castro.

(4) OAS-wide or bilateral agreements with Latin
American governments should be negotiated for joint
measures, to detect and to prevent arma smuggling by
land, sen, or air into Latin America. Because of the
urgency of the threat, Venezuela ahould be given first
priority and every effort be made to build up Venezuela
ag a decisive defeat for communism in Latin America.

(5) We should strengthen on-site programa to increase
the antisubversion capabilities in the Latin American
countries. At present, the Commnist and Castroite
groups in most Latin American countries are not large,
and for the most part they are disorganis and poorly
equipped. However, the capabilities of the governments
of the area for detecting and coping with infiltration,
subversion, and armed uprising are very low.

i (6) We should attract world attention to Venezuelan
efforts to expoge the Castro regime for ita plots and
acts of subversion against Latin American governments
and to help provide a legal basis for collective actioi
by the OAS against Castro.

2. CIA has attempted in a general and very Limited mans
te se these assurances, but it remains for the Presiden:
and Administrationgpokesmen to instill ae genuine sense of
U.5, comaitment to our efforts, President Kennedy's speech ii)
the Inter~American Press Asseciation on 18 November alluded t:
this problem when he stated:

HW 50955 Docld:32423815 Page 12


"No Cuban need feel trapped between
dependence on the broken promises of foreten
Communism and the hostility of the rest of
the hemisphere, For once Cuban sovereignty
has been restored we will extend the hand of
friendship end assistance to a Cubs whose
political and economic institutions have
been shaped by the will of the Cuban people.”

3. Our Station in Miami reports thet exile conservr-
tives were depressed because they interpreted this possare
as U.S. willingness to accept "Fidelismo without Fidel,
while leftist oriented groups were encouraged to believe
that “anti-Communist progressive and revolutionary cisment«"
have the support of the U.8. Government, These Cuban
exile reactions, however, cannot he taken as reflecting
the views of people ingide Cuba. It is typical of exiles
that they become oversensitive to the innuendoes of
official public statements bearing upon their problems.
Within Cuba, we believe that President Kennedy's statement
probably contributed significantly to providing political
assurances to the relatively amall number of potential
coupsters to whom these remarks are addressed, But we
believe that action may be expected to follow only wnen
these assurances are coupled with open recognition fron
authoritative U.S. spokesmen that iaany Cubans now serving
in the esrmed forces and other power centers of the Ces
regime will have to play a major role in its overtirow,
These people need to be assured that the United Stat
sympathetic to the personal problems they will tace
event of a successful coup. To meet this and relisted
problems, we recommend that the following passe,

"To these men I say the United States is
ready to welcome to discuasion without rancor

the Cuban people to strike down the barrier

American republics, We recognize that many
non—Communist Cubeas who now appear to be a
part of the machinery of tyranny, will uliti-
mately be instruments in destroying it. ar
for this reason should be entitled to spec
consideration,"

4, The President may also wish tc refer te a Speeci
celebrating the return of the Brigade menberg delivere: b
President Kennedy at the Orange Bowl on 29 December 1962
at which time he declared:

“Under the Alianza para el Progreso, we
