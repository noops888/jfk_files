LA 4410-C-TE was interviewed on 3/11/64 by SAs
GEORGE E. BLAND and JAMES F. BRENT, and advised as follows:

He left Los Angeles with his wife on 1/7/64, and
drove straight through to Chicago, which departure was :
caused by information he received concerning a judgement about -
to be rendered against his brother for. $3,300.00 which actually
was the responsibility of the informant. :

when he arrived at Chicago, he contacted his attorney
MIKE KACHIGIAN in regard to this matter. In conversation
with nis attorney he was .told by him as well as another
attorney in the same office, MIKE LEVIN, that .a contract .was
out for informant and neither attorney expected to see him
alive when he appeared in their office. According to LEVIN,
he heard from an someone at a party that. a contract-was out
to kill informant.

_ During informant's stay in,Chicago, from shortly
after 1/7/64, to shortly before his: arrival back in Los
Angeles on; 3/5/64, he learned the following:

From several sources he considers knowledgeable,
he was told that. the victim (CHARLES WILLIAM BRAY) in the
Miami prosecution of ALDERISIO has been straightened out and
that they have got to him and he will not stand up for the -
government and testify.

Also that SAM GIANCANA is no longer the boss in
Chicago but has stepped aside and "MILWAUKEE PHIL" ALDERISIO
has taken over from GIANCANA as the boss. Informant. con-
siders the sources of the above information to be knowledgeable.

In order to handle his brother's case, informant

found it necessary to be in the Cook County Clerk's Office :
as well as the State Attorney's Office and commented that no
one will check a record or do anything for you without $2.00
being paid to them. In this instance,:informant said he was
handing out five and ten dollars and sometimes more to >
numerous people in:order to get the necessary records. In_ fy
this regard, he talked to a Deputy Sheriff named SAMUEL PEVIN 7
who serves subpoenas and who recently had a heart attack.

was one of the people who said that "they" had gotten -
to BRAY in Miami. PEVIN was selling Papermate or Scripto, i

but believed to be. Papermate, ball point pens that retail for
$1.98 for 4o¢ a piece.and he had hundreds. of them. PEVIN
explained that there were 350,000 such pens stolen from a
trailer and they are being sold all over Chicago for 30¢ and
4o¢ a piece.  PEVIN also advised informant that. he had
stolen Admiral portable television sets for $40.00 a, piece
as well as stolen Norelco electric’ shavers for a very good
price. z :

In regard. to MANNY ‘SKAR, informant said that ROCKY
DE STEFANO is behind SKAR and they got $300,000 net, from the sale of
Sahara Inn North,;.Chicago. Also that they went to buy back
the Sahara Inn-that they sold to GENE AUTRY and, according
to informant, this may possibly explain | the bombings of the
Sahara.

"also; ‘DON: JO MEDLEVINE is: close to SKAR and is also :
believed by informant to be fronting for DE STEFANO. MEDLEVINE es
claims to have:lost. $60,000 of his own money in the Chez Paris :
that recently closed in Chicago; however, informant does not ,
believe MEDLEVINE-.lost anything since they probably were tee
stealing off the top. Informant understands that MEDLEVINE
is coming back .to. Los.Angeles to get into another operation.

Informant was asked if’ he knew DENNIS STEIN, who f
is known. to have been recently closely associated with SKAR
in Los Angeles: Informant recalled a DANNY STEIN, who was an’ .
auctioneer from New York who may be identical since his }
description is similar.

In regard to the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada,
it is informant's understanding that the Chicago..outfit ows
this hetel. . Informant produced a’ card reflecting the name ;
of FRED FRIEDMAN whom he described as former manager at’ the :
Riviera Hotel. and was Kicked out broke ‘some time ago, and ~~
came to him about a year ago looking for a job-in.the vend-
ing machine ‘business. At, that time, FRIEDMAN's Los Angeles
phone. number was. WE 1-9090." ‘Informant believes that’ FRIEDMAN, a
who. he knows"deeply resents his treatment by the hotel B
owners, might talk about the operation of the Riviera Hotel.

Informant also mentioned that he has seen, JACK FOX
(PCL) and he is-real sick. FOX's son BILLY, informant under-
stands, is tied.up with FRED SICA.
