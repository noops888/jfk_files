exiles and the intensification of the ‹ overt program.

6. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 December 1!63.

This meno is mainly important becaise it reveals who in the Admin-

Istration was dealing with Cuban policy. The list of people to attend

che meeting on Cuba held this day inclided: Lyndon B. Johnson, Rusk,

Ed Martin, McNamara, McCone, Helme or les Fitzgerald, Don Wilson, Bundy,

and Chase.

%. Meno, Bundy to Lyndon B. Johnson, 12 December 1963.

For a press conference, Bundy reconmends the following language re-

In this four year period.

9. Chase minutes on meeting with Lyndon B. Johnson, 27 December 1963.

The meeting appears to be the first major briefing for the new Presi

dent on Cuba. Desmond Fitzgerald did most of the briefing, which 1n-

cluded a detailed description of CIA assets in Cuba, proposed sabotage plans,

and

actempts by the CIA to stimulate an internal coup which would

dislodge Castro.

The CIA was alding two exile groups in particular:

one led by Manuel Artime, the ocher by lanolo Ray.

Bundy recomenda

that Lyndon B. Johaso

we have in the past."

10. Memo, Bundy to L

a Johnson, Johnson, January January 1964.

Bundy recoumends a Cabinet-level re/lew of the whole principle of

covert sabotage against Cuba.

He notes that Rusk and McNamara do not

support the program of sabotage, while 'McCone and the CIA are for 1t,

so are most of the middle-level offIcers dealings with the Castro

problen."

Bundy concludes:"

..oIn. your position, I would stop sabotage

attacks on the ground that they are 111 :gal, Ineffective, and damaging

to our broader policy."

18. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 21 April 1964.

Notes that Alexis Johnson is in charg: of contingency planning for a coup

in Cuba.

19. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 14 May 1964..

This memo suggests that a primary goal of the Johnson Administration was

"to keep the lid on Cuba" until after the November Presidential elections.

Thus, the continued exile raids were view d negatively since they increased

the noise level.

The memo makes it clear that the exile raids were becoming

completely beyond U.S. control despite CL\ financial support to the groups.

20. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 June 1964.

Chase notes that Castro has executed hree anti-Castro Cubans and jailed

two others as CIA agents. CIA admits hav.ng a connection with the executed

Cubans "but that it is completely deniabl.."

Exiles to Assassinate Selected Cuban Gove nment Leaders"

The CIA was made aware of certain plaus to kill Castro. The Agency tol

the sources, according to Helms, that

"thi: United States Goverment would not,

under any circumstances, condone the plaried actions." Apparently on 2 March

1964 a wealthy Cuban exile was approached with a Cosa Nostra offer to assassinate

Castro for $150,000.

The wealthy exile timed down the offer. Similar offers

were make to other Cuban exiles in early larch. A leading figure in the

negotiations was

a shippin:- businessmen from Ft. Lauderdale.

An agreement was finally made to pay the

$100,000 for killing

castro, plus $z,500 for expenses.

agrees with John and with the need to foniard the matter to the Special

Group.

5: Memo, Chase to Bundy, 16 June 1964, w.th attachment (Des FitzGerald's

"A Reappraisal of Autonomous Operations)

FitzGerald makes a defense of the autonomous operations. Tom Mann and

Chase disapprove of the operations, though for different reasons.

24. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 18 June 1964.

Chase warns that further U.S. support of the autonomous groups is more

likely to lead to a U-2 shootdown and a Cribbean crisis than the overthrow

of the Castro regime.

Chase continues to be worried about noice levels

and the November election. This memo is very much like his 14 May memo

(see Item 19).

25. Memo for the Record, Peter Jessup, 22 June 1964.

In a reference to Helm's memo on assa;sination (see Item 21), it was

pointed out in a 303 Committee meeting of 18 June that "these reports, in

effect, put the United States Government on notice that failure to take

preventive action could be construed as condonation. "

The AG said Justice

would look into the matter.

26. Memo, McCone to Bundy, 19 August 1964.

McCone sumnarizes the FBI investigation of Cuban exile plots against

Castro as outlined in Helm's memo of 19 Jime (See Item 21). The Bureau

interviewed many

people allegedly invo ved, most of whom denied the existence

of such a plan: The Bureau did not interv.ew

the country). The most

29. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 12 November 1964, and attachment (apparently

a Bundy memo for a meeting with LBJ on 7 April 1964).

The Bundy memo suggests that LBJ approved various options "short of

war to get rid of the Castro regime," including the possible contamination

of sensitive Cuban Imports (not food).

The Chase memo Indicates that a

Fitzgerald operation was underway in November 1964 to ship contaminating

elements into Cuba.

30. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 30 December 1964.

The Artime group is out of control, though State, Defense and CIA

(as well as Bundy) all agree that it would be unwise to try to interfere

with him at this stage.

31. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 5 January 1965.

Chase reports a plan told to Criumins and the CIA about an Artime plot

to stage a "palace coup" during which Castro and other top leaders would be

"neutralized.". D-Day was to be March 13. This matter was to be discussed

at an upcoming Special Group meeting on whether or not "to cut off Artime'g

Chase notes: "CIA at this point is loath to make a hard evaluation

of the Artime/Cubela plot."

32. Memo to 303 Committee, unsigned, 18 January 1965, presumably a CIA

Discusses the Virtues of continuing Underwater Demolition Teams against

ships in Cuban harbors. If such activities are disallowed, the CIA should

be authorized to reduce ite commitment 11 the paramilitary field.

33. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 8 February 1955.

This memo indicates that not even Artime had his group in control.

Memo, Chase to Bundy, 2 March 1965

Discussion of who is for maintainin; a covert capability against Cuba

(presently on the shelf) and who is opposed. Chase guessed that CIA would

be opposed ("fish or cut bait"); State wuld not.

Rusk's general attitude

toward Cuba at this time was to keep the temperature low while sorting out

the Vietnam problem.

36. Memo, Chase to Bundy, 4 March 1965.

Chase recommend phasing out suppost to Artime. The CIA is consider-

ing diluting pesticides sent to Cuba; t'is is similar to the kinds of tactics

mentioned in Items 28 and 29 above and i re a manifestation of the moral

bankruptcy of U.S. palicy. Also some tilk here of backing a new exile

group, RECE, though not much enthusiasm for the idea from anyone apparently.

Oddly, CIA wishes to drop its paramilitity capability, while DoD and State

want the capability maintained.

37. Memo, Grant Hilliker (State) to Burdy, 18 June 1965.

This is a summary of U.S. policy teward Cuba. The ultimate objective

is still to replace the Castro regime.

The memo notes that "the paramilitary

program involving CIA controlled actions was set aside even before it really

started."

38. Memo, Bundy to LBJ, 26 June 1965.

Adm. Raborn recoumends reactivatior of a paramilitary effort against

Cuba. Bundy, Touny Thompson, Rusk, McNamara, and Cy Vance are against this

chiefly because of the concomitant international noise level.

writes, "do not recommend visible violent actions against Cuba."

Raborn'g

recommendations said nothing about assassination.

39. Memo, Rostow to LBJ, 30 May 1966.

Rostow notifies the President that a CIA exfiltration mission ran into

ambush and the agents were captured. The President could expect "the noise

level of Castro's charges of 'threatened Yankee aggression' may go up."

40. Memo, Karamessines, DDP, to Rostow, 7 August 1967.

This memo is important because it lists the names of two or three Cubans

who worked on CIA missions. If they are in the U.S., It may be worthwhile

talking to them about their activities.

Dave Phillips was to be in charge of the new CIA Cubà- program.

Bowdler advises that "we be alert to indications that Castro is looking for

accommodation or his disillusioned lieut nants want to know where we stand

If they move to dump him."
