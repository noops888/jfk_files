From a review of the Agency'S file on Lee Harvey OSWALD

it becomes apparent that the Agency and pts field Stations partia

cularly in Mexico City and Miaimf, were not unmindful. of the possi

bility that OSWALD did not

act alone During the first few weeks

after the assassination, Headquarters, upon at least three occar

sions, exhorted the Mexico City Station to continue Vall your

coverage of the Cuban and Soviet installations. a On-28 Novem

made with AZUE, for the applications to be handled solely by a

cal employee and a lame duck like AZUE whose slot had been taken

by the DGI Chief?

Whatever the answer to these questions, they were

not asked at the times

And there remains the more fundamental, ques

tion: accepting the DURAN story as it stands, could it have hap

pended without the knowledge and participation of DGI personnel in

the Consulate? This seems untikely espectally because Manuel En

man whom he later recognized as Lee Harvey OSWALD receive $6,500

in cash to kill an important person in the United States.

ALVARADO described the circumstances as follows:

standing by a bathroom door about noon he saw a group of three

persons conversing on à patio a few feet away... One was a tall,

thin Negro with reddish hair, obviously dyed, who spoke rapidly i

The second

was a white person whom ALVARADO had seen previously in a waiting

room carrying a Canadian passport.

The white person had green

eyes, blondish hair, with a pompadour hairdo, and dark eyeglasses

19258

The third person allegedly was Lee Harvey OSWALD. ALVARADO was

convinced of this

this from published photographs of OSWALD following

the assassination. OSWALD was wearing a black sport coat, but-

toned-up white shirt with short collar tabs, no tie, dark gray

pants, and clear eyeglasses?

He had a green passport in his pocket

wore a wrist watch with a yellow band, and appeared to have a pis-

tol in a shoulder holster. A tall Cuban joined the group momen-

tarily and passed American currency to the Negro.

allegedly said to OSWALD in English,

"I want to kill the man."

OSWALD replied, "You're not man enough, I can do it.

then said in Spanish, "I cane go wich you.

OSWALD replied, the people are waiting for me back there."

The

Negro chen gave OSWALD-$6,500 in large denomination U.S. bills;

saying, "This isn't much" After hearing this conversation, an

rado said that he telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City

several times on 20 September before the assassination in an at

tempt to report his belief that someone important in the United

States was to be killed, but was finally told by someone at the

Embassy to stop wasting his time.

ALVARADO was known to this Agency as a former informant

of Nicaraguan security service.

His reliability was considered

questionable by American authorities although he had not been

wholly discredited. ALVARADO claimed he was in Mexico City working

against the Cuban communists for his service.

The service

ever, has denied that he was acting on its behalf:

(Comment: Some idea of the time and effort expended by the Agency

in breaking ALVARADO's story may be gained from a review of the

Chronological Summary of the Gilberto ALVARADO interrogation under

-attachment IV.)

Although the Warren Report had used the ALVARADe case to

demonstrate the cype of allegation the Agency had had to contend el

with, the schweiker Report took the Agency to task for not having

become more suspicious of possible Cuban involvement in the assassi

7. 2226-55 2.000250 244

nation. To some extent, the authors of the Schweiker Report are

right.

There were other rumors and allegations indicating that

OSWALD may not have acted entirely on his own; however, none of

there rumors and allegations stood up under intensive

investigation

Moreover, each rumor or allegation was treated as a separate and

unrelated case -the only common denominator being OSWALD. There

appears to have been no suspicion on the part of the

Agency. that

these rumors and allegations might have been part of a larger decep

tion plan orchestrated by a foreign counterintelligence service.

Sadda

Only a thorough investigation of all available information including

overt comments by responsible communist officials could have allayed

these suspictons or generated additional requirements to be levied

on Agency assets worldwide. Obviously such an investigation would

05930245713

have required an enormous quantity of patience, time, and personnel

None of these prerequisites was available, specially in light of

ANUS 4001

the tremendous political pressures under which the Agency, the EBI

the Warren Commission, and others were working precluded the initia

tion of such an investigation.

In its response to the above letter, the Agency noted

that the results of its review "add nuance, not evidence, to what

in this subject"

As to CASTRO's remarks during an informal interview by

mented that "There can be no question from the facts surrounding the

CASTRO appearance, which had not been expected, and his agreement

to the interview,

the purpose

According to the author of the review was to reconsider

Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the assumption that as an avid news

paper reader - which is known from testimony of Marina OSWALD and.

others- he read the CASTRO warning and threat which appeared New

Orleans' principal morning paper, the Times-Picayune, on Monday,

9 September 1963.

The results of the review, admittedly

using 20-20 hindsight, may be set out in summary:

That,

indeed, was the opinion at the working level

there appears-to be a strong-possibility that a down payment was

made to OSWALD in the Cuban Embassy there, presumably with-promise

of a subsequent payment after assassination." The Ambassador was

reading-somewhat more into the situation than was the case. The

reference to DORTICOS_= the Cuban President - relates to two rele-

phone conversation between DORTICOS and HERNANDEZ, the Cuban Amba-

ssador to Mexico, on 26 November 1963.

DURAN to say something, that they had some interest in, and had

offered some money to the American?" To which HERNANDEZ answers

that there was nothing about money.

DORTICOS is quoted as saying:

afternoon for the first time. In a brief interview, which lasted

only seven-minutes, in the company of two Mexican officials,

ALVARADO reverted to his previous story.. He claimed he did see

OSWALD and that he did call the Embassy to report.

-(Latter state-

ment not supported by Embassy investigation.) ALVARADO went on to

say that he told the Mexicans he was fabricating because he was

"mentally mistreated", specifically because he was threatened that

he would be hanged by the testicles. Actually he was not physically

mistreated. (WHEELOCK said he was unable to come to any definite

conclusion as to ALVARADO's veracity; however, he would be able to

do so once he returned to Managua and had a chance to complete the

interrogation. "(MEXI-7023 IN 71702, 2 December 1963)
