the

The courts have interpreted this statute to require advocacy to

actIon, 1.e.,

advocacy to do something, now or in the future, rather

than merely to believe in something.

• In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, there

.are two other statutes which might provide a statutory foundation for

an investigation under this section.

d. [Internal

Security Act of 1950 (I 50, USC, § 783a)

In addition to the three

principal statutes outlined in sub-

paragraphs a., bo, and co,

the Internal Security Act could

provide a statutory basis

for investigation of certain cases

under this section.

This Act makes it unlawiul to knowingly

contribute to the establishment of a totalitarian dictatorship

within the United States which is controlled by a foreig

overnment, organization, or individual..

Prosecutive determination

All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investigations

initiated under this section will be conducted by

FBIHQ with Departmental

officials.

These cases should not be discussed with local U. S. Attorney's

office without FBIHQ approval.

Related statutes

There are

a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handling these

investigations.

Information concerning possible violations of such statutes is frequently

developed during these

investigations.

Where this occurs the tield should

consider the desirability of conducting investigation in line with the

policies and procedures governing the statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investigations

is outlined in an appendix

to this manual.

Definitions

The term "subversive activities" as used in this section denotes

activities which are aimed at overthrowing:

destroying or undermining the

Government of the United States or any of its political subdivisions bu

the illegal means prohibited by statutes enumerated in A. 1o above. The

term "'subversive organization" or "subversive movement" denotes a group

or movement which is known to engage in or advocate subversive activities,

as defined above.

5. Predication for investigation

In all cases handled under the provisions of this section, the first

communication prepared for outside dissemination (report or LHM)

show specifically the statute upon which the investigation is based

together with necessary supporting

facts. Where investigation has been

specifically requested by Departnent, this should be indicated.

following examples are illustrative; however, the basis for each

individual case must be tailored to

the circumstances of

such case.

"This investigation is based on information that the subject's

activities could involve violation of I 18, USC, § 2383 (Rebellion

or Insurrection), and $ 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy)•

A source whose

reliability has not been determined has informed that the subject

is planning, along with others, to

travel to Washington, D. C.

01 April 30,

1971, to participate in planned violent demonstrations

luring the first week in May, 1971, to

"shut down the Government.'

Demonstration plans include

the blocking of streets and highways,

destruction of personal and Government property, and physical

obstruction to prevent Government employees from reporting to work."

"This investigation is based

on information

that the subject's

activities couid involve a violation of I 18, USC, § 2385 (Advocating

the overthrow

of the Government).

The subject is

an admitted member

(or has beén identified as a member by a confidential source who

has provided reliable information in the past) of (name of group).

The (name of group) in its public statements and publications

advocates the desirability and necessity of overthrowing the U.S.

Government by force or violence, and the assassination of U. S.

Government officers.

The same

source has reported that the subject

actively supporis these positions."

Nhere possible, the first intra-Bureau communication prepared which

indicates that

is being|conducted|should specifically

indicate the statutory basis for the investigation.

However,

may be occasions involving individuals or groups in contact with known

subversive elements where the purpose of the contact is not initially

known and where a preliminary inquiry must be made to determine

whether a

statutory basis exists for full investigation.

In these

instances, a preliminary inquiry may be undertaken, through estab-

sources, for a period not to exceed 90 days, without specifically

indicating the

specific statutory basis for the inquiry.

If after the

conclusion of 90 days it has not been possible to establish a

statutory basis but further inquiry appears necessary, FBIHQ must

be furnished a succinct summary of the facts by letter together with

specific recommendations

as to further action.

In all cases, of

course, investigations must be based on indications that subject

engaged in subversive activity, whether or not a SpecIIIC

statutory basis is cited.

In the event preliminary inquiries fail to establish a sound basis

for investigation, the case should be promptly closed and there is.

no need to advise FBIHQ (unless FBIHQ has been previously advised

of the inquiry).

Nor is there any need to prepare an LHM or report

where no pertinent subversive derogatory information has been developed.

If the statutory basis for an investigation should change or be

expanded to include an additional statute or statutes, the first

communication prepared subsequent to such change or expansion should

specifically

show such changes.

Similarly, this information

should

be included in the next

report or LHM prepared in the case.

scribed above, do not recommend for ADEX but follow procedures

described above to consider for ADEX upon release from imprisonment.

ADEX should not include individuals who may be ideologically committed

to a philosophy which calls for the downfall of our form of government

or which favors another form of society but who have not shown a current

willingness or capability of engaging in meaningful action to promote

their beliefs.

This might apply, for example, to rank-and-file members

of the Socialist Workers Party or the Communist Party, USA, or other

old-line revolutionary groups which have advocated an overthrow of

our present form of government but where subject's activity is

primarily ideological in nature and not oriented toward action. Each

PREFACE

GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVUSTIGATI

A. GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

Fundamental to all investigations by the IBI is

the need to protect the

constitutional rights of any individual while

still thoroughly and

expeditiously discharging those responsibilities with which it is charged

by statutes and Directives of the President and the Attorney General.

The FBI is a fact-finding agency which seeks with equal vigor to gather

which will aid in

the successiul prosecution,

or establish the

innocence, of alleged violators of laws of the United

States or of those

who are accused of

seeking by force to subvert or overthrow the Goverument

of the United States.

The FBI makes no determination of the guilt or

innocence of any individnal or group

so accused.

To this end, guidelines have been

established to be followed in

Investigation of cases falling within the jurisdiction of the FBI, to

prevent unwarranted investigations and invasions of the constitutional rights

of any person.

[B. [SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

In matters affecting the security of the United States, under no circumstance

is an investigation conducted of any individual on the

basis that such indi-

vidual supports unpopular causes or opposes Government policies. All inves-

tigations of

subversive or extremist activities are directed to the collection

of information pertinent to a determination as to whether or not the subject

has violated, or is

engaged in activities which may result in a violation of,

one of several specifically enumerated Federal statutes; or are in fulfill-

ment of instructions from the Department of Justice. All communications re-

these cases must be limited to intormation regarding the subject's

subversive activities, sympathies and affiliations; pertinent background data

covering subversive individuals or groups with which the subject is connected;

and essential background data regarding the subject. No electronic surveil-

lance may be instituted without the specific authority of the Attorney General.

Prior FBIHQ approval is required to institute an investigation of a faculty

member or an organization connected with an institution of learning or to

interview a student or faculty member other than established sources.

tigations of foreign diplomatic or official personnel are not instituted with-

specific approval by FBIHQ and clearance from the Department of State.

No investigations are conducted of active or retired members of the s

military forces under terms of a delimitations agreement entered into betweei

the FBI and the counterintelligence services of the armed forces..

C. CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE - ORGANIZED CRIME

Where matters of a criminal intelligence nature or organized crime are

concerned, investigations are conducted to develop and maintain current

the activities of organized crime in general, and to develop

substantive cases against individual racket figures.

These investigations

are highly selective and

are, concentrated on the loaders of organized crime

and their reported associates.

Any electronic surveillance used in these

investigations requires

approval of the Bureau, the Attorney General, and

authorization by a court order.

D. APPLICANT-TYPE MATTERS

In the area of applicant investigations, specific standards have been

established to protect

the rights of individuals.

All relevant information,

both favorable

and unfavorable, obtained

concerning an individual must be

duly reported; investigation is limited to checks of pertinent records and

interviews of

persons in a position to furnish relevant information; persons

furnishing derogatory information are requested to furnish a signed statement.

The FBI makes no evaluation or recommendation to the requesting agency

concerning the applicant.

PREFACE.

GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

[E. GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIN

MATTERS

Our investigative jurisdiction in criminal cases is based on specizic

violations of Federal laws.

Investigations are conducted when information

is received indicating a violation of a Federal law, over which we have been

given investigative

jurisäiction, has occurred.

Results of our investigations

are furnished to United States Attorneys or the Department of Justice for

determination of the course of any prosecutive action.

The decision may be

made to present the case to a Federal Grand Jury cr,

if the facts so justify,

to arrest the subject, in which latter instance the

arrest is made on the

basis of authorized prosecution and the issuance of a warrant.

Upon arrest,

the subject must be brought before the nearest United States Magistrate or

Federal Judge in accordance with established rules of Federal criminal

procedure.

[

Requests for FBI investigations in selected civil matters in which the United

States is or may be a party in interest are received from the United States

Attorneys and/or the Department of Justice.

These are handled in strict

conformity with guidelines furnished by the Department of Justice, as are also

investigations of violations of the civil rights, antiriot, election laws,

and antitrust laws.

IF. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

In addition to these principles, numerous other restrictions apply to a11

phases of our work.

For example, our authority to arrest fugitives is

1

statutory.

The United States Code empowers Special Agents to make arrests

and carry firearms but FBI policy further requires that only that force may

be used which is necessary to effect arrest with due regard being observed

for the safety of the arresting officers and others.

•Special Agents are not pernitted to shoot anyone except in self-detense.

No surveillances are conducted in the White House, the Capitol,

• the Supreme

Jourt, or the House and Senate Oiiice Buildings.

No surveillance, electronic

or otherwise, may be instituted on any member of Congress,

any Justice or

Judge, or any principal functionary of the Executive Branch.

Our Special

Agents may not engage in entrapment or any other improper, illegal, or

unethical tactics in procuring information or evidence; any critical

complaints concerning FBI personnel must be thoroughly investigated; any

testimony by a Special Agent in court must be given clearly and without bias

I

The

foregoing is a general statement of guidelines for FBI investigations.

All investigative personnel must follow these rules.

According to Department, prohibitions in

section 793(a) (b) are conditioned

upon suspect having

national defense with intent

or reason to believe

that it is to be used to

injury of U.S. or advantage of any foreign nation; those in subdivision

(c) requira

it will be used contrary to espionage laws; subdivisions (a) and (e) relate

to suspects who already have possession of

or access to information relating

to national defense, either lawfully or

unlawfully, which they have reason

to believe could be

used to injury of U.S. or to advantage of any foreign

nation, and who willfully transmit it to unauthorized persons or retain it

after demand made by person authorized to receive it a demand is only

necessary under subdivision (a) where individual has lawful possession no

is necessary under

subdivision (e) where person has unauthorized

possession); subdivision (I) applies to suspects who have lawful possession

of national defense information and permit it to be lost or destroyed through

gross negligence or fail to report its loss to proper authorities.

Department has instructed all USAs that its prior authorization is necessary

before instituting prosecutive action

in espionage cases, except in emergency

subiect is fueitive or damade may result from delay.

In cases involving photographing violations, Department has advised such

can be more expeditiously handled by presenting directly to USA for

preliminary opinion.

This does not alter policy of presenting all espionage

cases to Department prior to actual prosecution.

Concerning section 798, Department has advised that classification may be

effected by written directive, or by marking or stamping on item classified;

authorization may be established by written directive or oral testimony.

Decodes of unclassified information are covered by act where it can be

they facilitated analysis of cryptographic system.

Department holds that photographing or sketching of outside of commercial

establishment engaged in manufacture of classified military or naval arms

and munitions Ior U.S. Army, Navy, or Air Force would not constitute violation

of section 795 and/ or 797, where no classified equipment or material appears

in photograph or sketch.

Department has suggested following procedurés when obtaining and returning

photographs taken in violation of section 795:

Subject should be requested

to relinquish film.

Receipt should be given to subject and signed statement

obtained to effect

film is being voluntarily relinquished.

section 795 should be submitted to FBI laboratory for any

necessary processing and should then be submitted to commanding officer of

military post, or other installation, for

censorship. If film contains

photographs in violation of section 795, it should be delivered to USA either

directly by commanding officer or through Bureau. 24.02 117-42

returned to subject unless, at

As to rights of Bureau Agents in carrying out enforcement procedures regarding

violations of sections 795 and 796 by Soviet-bloc diplomatic and official

personnel, Department advised in summary as follows:

In all instances in which photographs

or sketches of defense installations

made by Soviet-bloc nationals, every reasonable effort should be made to

recover and confiscate these items in interest of national security.

Soviet-blo, nationals who have no diplomatic immunity are observed

by Bureau

Agents to photograph or sketch military installations in violation of

sections 795 and 796, they may be arrested without warrant and film seized

as evidence.

If observation is by person other than Bureau Agent, an arrest

warrant should be procured (because misdemeanor rather than a felony is

involved) and search warrant obtained if premises are involved.

Where Soviet-bloc or other foreign officials who may have diplomatic immunity

are observed taking photographs by Bureau Agents, they may be detained until

Bureau is satisfied they do in fact have immunity and film may be confiscated

interest of national security.

Il Agents do not actually observe the

activity but received information from outside source, film may not be legally

seized since warrant of arrest or search may not be lawfully executed against

person or premises having diplomatic immunity.

Investigation of violations of espionage and related statutes for

prosecutive purposes

Indolligence cosponsibilities

By Presidential directive FBI has counterintalligence responsibilities

which it shares with military intelligence agencies and is also

charged with correlating information relating to espionage and

making appropriate dissemination.

Coordination in domestic intelligence

field is effected through Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference.

By National Security Council directive, FBI and other U. S. intelligence

agencies coordinate

foreign and domestic intelligence through U. s

Intelligenca Board. (See

section 102A, volume IV, of this manual.

To aid in interpretation of Bureau's policies, following terms are

for formulation and execution oi Government policy

(2) Espionage - intelligence activity directed toward acquisition

of information through clandestine operations

STEP TAKEN BY COMMUNIST PARTI, USA, TO AVOID FROSECUTION UNDER THIS ACI

The Communist Party, USA, held, a special convention in New York City on

November 16 to 17, 1940.

This convention declared "that the Communist Party

of the USA in convention assembled, does hereby cancel and dissolve its organi-

zational affiliation with the Communist International, as well as any and all

other bodies of any kind outside the boundaries of the United States of America

for the specific purpose of removing itself from the terms of the so-called

Voorhis Act."

DEPARTMENTAL POLICY

[In 1941,

Department considered holding grand jury hearings under this

act at which leading Communist

Party lunctionaries would be subpoenaed.

The Japanese attack on Pearl

stopped any action in this regara.

When prosecutive action was initiated against the Communist Party and its

top lunationaries beginning in 1948, the Department selected the Smith

of 1940 (Title 18, USC

and the Internal Security Act of 1950

(Title 50, USC, 88

781-816) rather than the Voorhis Act.l

VENUE

Where the violation is the

failure to register, venue will lie only in the

District of Columbia; however,

aiders and abettors may be prosecuted in the

district in which

their criminal acts are performed, and conspiracy charges

may be prosecuted in the district in which

the conspiracy originates, or In

which any overt act thereunder takes place.

The courts have interpreted this

action,

rather

than merely to believe in something.

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, the tollow-

ing statute would pertain to investigations of Klan and other white

• hate groups.

(4)

Civil Rights Act of 1968 (I18, USC, $241)

In summary, this statute makes it unlawful for two or more

United States.

b. Prosecutive Determination

All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investi-

gations initiated under this section will be conducted by FBIHQ with

Departmental officials. These cases should not be discussed with

local U.S. Attorney's office without FBIHQ approval.

c.

There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handling

these investi-

Information concerning possible violations of such statutes

is frequently developed during these investigations.

Where this

the field should consider the desirability of conducting

investigation in line with the policies and procedures governing the

statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investi-

gations is outlined in

Subsection 9 of this section.

d.

FBI Responsibility

The FBI has been charged by various Presidents with the responsi

bility to coordinate and collect all information relating to the

internal security of the United States, including information iron

all other Federal and local agencies.

See Section 102, Volume IV

of this manual.

This coordination and collection
