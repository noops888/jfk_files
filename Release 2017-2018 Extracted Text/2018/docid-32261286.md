Interview:

On 2/24/78, SCA Investigators Harold Leap and

to the Security investigation of LHO prior to the assassi-

nation of JFK and the investigative response by the N.O. field

office after the assassination:

Kaạch began his FBI employment in 1941 and retired

in 1964. The last 13 years of his career was in the New

•Orleans office.

Kaach advised that he was assigned the LHO Security

investigation when LHO returned to New Orleans.

Kaach,

did not interview LHO or conduct surveillance relative to

LHO's activity. Kaach said he had no knowledge of any agent

in the N.O. office, other than Quiggle, contacting of con-

(?)

ducting surveillance relative to LHo activities.

Kaach

said he did contact LHO's landlady on two occasions.

The first

time was to ask that she report to him any unusual-activity

by LHo. She never reported any information to Kaach.

MILTON R. KAACH INTERVIEW

Page 2

On Kaach's second visit the landlady informed him that

LHo had moved to Dallas.

Kaach said that he then trans-

ferred the security case to the Dallas field office.

Leap ask Kaach if he was censored by the FBI for

the manner in which he handled the LHO security investigation.

Kaach said he was not censored.

Kaach said he retired

rather than be transferred to Springfield and the transfer

was not related to the LHO investigation.

Kaach said that he was certain the LHO was not a

security informant for the N.O. office. As S/A assigned

the LHO security investigation, he would have been advised

if LHO was an informant.
