After several’ conversations with Mir, Hall of the Depaitment.
of Justice, the U. S, Attorney has decided to proceed without calling” v4
on HIDALGO, ‘even for preliminary interview. Consequently,’ no
further action is required unless we hear further from Justice. -
Mr. Hall did say, however, that théy might well have to reconsider,
and may want to call on us again. I said we would make HIDALGO’:
available to their representative at any time in(Panama llput ifthe % J
request involved bringing HIDALGO to the United States we would |
have to reconsider the whole matter at that time. Mr. Hall said~
this was quite satisfactory and thanked us for our cooperation.
