additions such as correction of the name IRMINA BOUZA
ENRIQUEZ , addition of aliases of BOUZA, incorrect stating
of BOUZA's address, etc. Despite these additions, the
basic information in these paragraphs obviously was taken
from CAS/M-2403. 2)

As set forth in referenced teletypes,
upon contact by Bureau Agents on 3/23/68, advised he_had
not furnished certain information attributed to nin 2
this document, specifically that Cuban Power is comfosed
of two numbered the listing of members of each
cell. In fact, (oe Bivisea he had no information to
the effect this organization is composed of two numbered
cells, leading Miami to believe CIA has inadvertently
furnished mifzenor= information in their attempt to round

out eae =>

Jladvised Bureau Agents that on Saturday,
3/16/68, he had been seated in the Camaguey Restaurant,
Miami, where he overheard a conversation among three Cuban
males and one Cuban female seated nearby. With the
exception of the female, he was unable to furnish any

-

description of these individuals, stating he had not looked *

in their direction. The female departed and he briefly
glanced at her as she passed, but he did not see her face
and would not recognize her again. He could describe

her only as a white female, of Latin appearance, who was
"tall and thin." (This is believed to be an attempt on
his part to strengthen the later identification of her

as BOUZA, who is actually nearly 6 feet tall and very
slender. Following her departure, one of those remaining
inquired as to her identity and was told she was IRMINIA
BOUZA, former secretary of WENDELL. ROLLASON and currently

a night employee of "The Miami Herald" newspaper, According

to all of the additional details concerning her

connection with and activities on behalf of the Cuban Power,

as well as names of Cuban Power members and sympathizers
and other details(set out in CAS/M-2401 ,Jwere obtained by
him during this conversation.

{ advised he is not acquainted with BOUZA,
MORALES, CORNILLOT or any of their associates and was
simply Peporting information overheard by him on the above
occasion.

A1ttiough claimed he was able to recall
without notes the names of all persons mentioned in this <
conversation, he was unable to recall these names at the
time of this interview and found it_necessary to refer_to
a copy of his written report (to CIA|for these names, er)
attention was directed to the fact”he had furnished a
account number of RICARDO MORALES and he was specifically
asked if he had also been able to recall this number without <
benefit of notes, at which time he admitted this number had
been furnished by a "confidential connection" whom he refused
i to identify... He was obviously upset at being pinned down
as to the source of his information and attempted to explain
his refusal to identify his source by vaguely stating he was
a friend in the bank where MORALES had maintained his account,

whichis nat believed to be true, He denied his source was
ie SviDrdgana OSTA, stating he had never met KABA,
by In connection with the above, during previous
interviews with RICARDO MORALES, it was determined MORALES
had loaned his car to KABA while MORALES was in jail. In
the trunk of his car was a box of papers containing a passport
of BOUZA, erroneously issued under the name IRMINIA BOUZA,

and in the locked glove compartment was a bank book showing
MORALES* ‘bank account number which was known only to him, —

MORALES also indicated during these interviews that he

had placed sports-type hub caps on this car just prior

to his arrest on 2/14/68, when the car was loaned to KABA
(note reference to sports wheels in enclosure). The car

is a brown Pontiac sedan, purchased by MORALES in September,
1967, in the name of IRMINA BOUZA, his mistress. Although
the car is in her name, she has no driver*s license and has
never driven.it (note reference to her having transported
explosives and Cuban Power papers in this car). Since she
was unable to drive the car, it was loaned to KABA upon
MORALES* arrest.

2 During a subsequent interview with MORALES, he
advised he had obtained a confession from KABA to the effect
he had been Yollecting and reporting information to a Cuban
‘exile, MARIONASIP, and it is now felt MASIP is probably
source,

stated he was positive of the date of the
above conversation as 3/16/68, a Saturday, Regarding the
identification of the "tall and thin" female-as IRMINIA
BOUZA, it is noted inquiry by Bureau Agents at the apartment
of BOUZA on the night of 3/14/68, in an attempt to locate
MORALES for interview, determined MORALES had taken BOUZA- 7
to Mt. Sinai Hospital, Miami Beach, to have her baby. It.
was subsequently determined that she had a baby on the night
of 3/14/68 and remained in the hospital over the weekend.
Thus, she could not have en in the Camaguey Restaurant
on 3/16/68, as claimed_by This fact, along with
the illogicalness of story that he was able to _
overhear and retain all names and facts set forth in this -
report and his subsequent evasiveness during interview,

=

leads to the conclusion his story was fabricated It would

appear this conclusion should have been reached (by CIA piso. u)

report contains enough accurate information,
such as names and account number of MORALES, to give it the” f
appearance of authenticity when the source or method of . |
obtaining the information is not known. If (cra}had tncruaea (SC u)

A great deal of information sent to uiami (by CIA

It is recognized this is a delicate issue and as
stated in retel of 3/26/68, this matter was discussed in-

formally| with CIA liaison, AUSTIN HORN, on 3/25/68, at which
time he agreed with these observations, stating he would

discuss the matter with appropriate personnel and attempt to
correct this situation in the future. u)

E This matter was again brought up on 4/2/68(when
the SAC met with PAUL HENZE, Chief of Station, CIA, ami.
HENZE stated his organization is not now operating any
agents or informants, as such, in exile groups, and is not
engaging in any counterintelligence activities in the United>
