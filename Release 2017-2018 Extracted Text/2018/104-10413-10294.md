1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-F 52-6-1,
section V, paragraph 2 (a) (1).

A, EXPLOTTATION OF LEADS

(1) LIFEAT/Soviet LIFEAT has continued its
daily coverage of the home phones of two known Soviet Intelligence Officers.
This has enabled the interested Station officer to monitor the daily activities
of these officers including clandestine contacts of one and lately the appar-
ent. involvement of the other in an affair with the wife of another Soviet
official stationed in Mexico.

(2) LIFEAT/Polish During the final weeks of
BEKNAVE's stay in Mexico, LIFEAT provided continuing support to the attempted
approach to BEXNAVE. This support included periods of "live-monitoring" ‘the
target lines to give early warning of BFKNAVE's exact departure plans as well
as the movements of BEKNAVE, LiMEAT also initiated coverage of the Polish
Conmereial Office in support of the interested Station officer's attempt to
gain more information on that installation and the personnel assigned thereto.

(3) LIREAT/Cuban, LIFEAT coverage of two
targets related to the AMSTRUT operation are of great interest to JMWAVE and
Headquarters. EY
‘eekly to these customers, A recent and excellent roundup of AMSTRUT-5 Jone
by Headquarters drew heavily on LIFEAT provided information. This roundup
was very well done and greatly appreciated by the Station. During the re-
porting period nothing of interest was obtained from the coverage of the
home of.a Cuban Commercial Attache and it is planned to cut this coverage in
the near future if it remains unproductive.

(4) LIFEAT/Extle LIFEAT coverage of ESLARD-1
continues to be of interest to both the Station, Headquarters and other
Stations who are connected with FSLARD-l's activities. Information con- .
cerning ESLARD-1's planned travel to both Central America and PBPRIME was
fully reported from this coverage. LIFEAT information enables the Station
to provide timely physical surveillance of ESLARD-1 which should give intor-
mation of his exact departure date and mode of travel.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

LIFEAT continued coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura has provided
a number of leads for possible agent candidates to assess and develop this
Costa Rican Communist exile.

(5) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)
‘The information provided to the local ODENVY office from the coverage of
David DRUCKER and Charles SMALL (SMOLIKOFF) is most useful to that office
for covering American leftists and Communists who travel to Mexico. Often
these travellers continue on to Cuba, ‘Their contacts with members of ACGM
are of special interest to ODENVY.

(6) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous As noted in reference the
coverage of a former SMOTH agent is of interest to Headquarters, SMOTH and
the senior ODYOKE official in Mexico, Recent information from this coverage
indicates that this individual is continuing in his literary efforts against
PBPRIME interest.

LIFEAT, at Headquarters request, has undertaken coverage of two
targets of ZRKNICK interest. Although the coverage has not as yet been of
sufficient duration to judge the take definitively, one of these coverages
appears to have potential in providing information of interest,

B, PROCESSING OF TAKE

Processing workload of the LIFEAT processor/translator staff remains
heavy, but no backlog has developed. With the recruitment of LIFEUD-28,
‘there will be a possible more equitable division of the work for the noted
staff.

C, PERSONNEL

LIFEUD-28 was granted a POA on 8 July 1963,

This agent candidate is

presently being assessed. PRQ Part II will be forwarded at the earliest

possible date.

LIFEUD-1 has continued to make a substantial contribution to the success o!

the LIFEAT operation.

Just prior to the reporting period, a telephone work crew disconriect:
the LIFEAT lines routing the Yugoslav Embassy tap lines to the basehouse.
‘This was done at a point one-half mile from the basehouse and en equal di:
tance from the target Embassy, and at a point where the tap routing was
"jumped" from one telephone central's area to the central area serving th
basehouse. It was assumed the telephone crew would be curious as to the
nature of these unusual connections. LIFEAT therefore disconnect
the tap routing completely between the basehowse and the telephone work c

DISPATCH

Even if the crew had then attempted to checkout the routing it would have
been impossible. No direct damage was done to LIFEAT as a result of this
discovery but it was agreed that if possible LIENVOY should assume the
Yugoslav coverage in the future. If such will not prove feasible, a coo!
off period will ensue prior to LIFEAT attempting to re-establish the note
coverage.

F, ‘TECHNICAL
