Another feature of this conversation is the fact that

GIANCANA flew in to Chicago from San Francisco on 11/5/60, and

MOE DALITZ, who has connections with the Stardust and Desert Inn

Hotels in Las Vegas, also came into town over the week end of

11/5/60. Purpose of these two individuals appearing then could be

adjudication over the above-described situation. It could also

apply to the situation wherein MARSHALL CAIFANO embarrassed

certain people in Las Vegas. U

MOE and MOONEY, mentioned in the above conversation,

are one

1n the same; namely, SAMUEL GIANCANA. V

Approximately a week before this conversation took place,

MARSHALL CAIFANO was in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Desert Inn

Hotel and was ordered to leave Las Vegas by local authorities

and he refused to do so. During his stay in Las Vegas, CAIFANO

was the subject of much

controversy and became involved in a fist

fight with a reporter for the "Las Vegas Sun". CAIFANO left

Las Vegas, Nevada, on 10/30/60.

SU.4432-C advised that Major

RIDDLE, President of the

lunes Hotel, Las Vegas; JACK ENTRATIER, President of the sands

Hotel, Las Vegas; MILTON PRELL, President of the sahara iotel,

Las Vegas; and other Las Vegas

Hotel owners and executives, were

extremely upset over the recent activities of MORRIS DALITZ and

his associates in their efforts to take over the Riviera Hotel

1n Las Vegas, in defiance of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

These persons feel that this is bringing unnecessary pressure

on all of the "Strip" hotels and will undoubtedly result in

additional restrictive legislation.

According to SU 43%-C,

these hotel owners also blame the Desert Inn group for the raids

on the casinos by the Gaming Control Board, which has been carried

out in all of the hotels visited by MARSHALL CAIFANO, mentioned

above. (4)

HUMPHREYS:

What did I want to talk to MOE about? Oh yeah.

When you go out, he's got that, his

brothers

are in that motel up north and they've got

their own laundries up there. They found out

it was too costly, it's being torn and every

thing. They reached out for a then company,

MORRIE

wants an appointment with his brother. They're

reachtag out.

I have to get for NANCY, ... his

boy are in the army. I know NANCY's brothers

are in the army ...

The motel referred to by HUMPHREYS "up north" is the

ilver load Motel, which is allegedly owned by GIANCANA and managed

by CHARLES GIANCANA, brother of SAMUEL GIANCANA. Apparently

this motel has been operating their own laundry service and were

WILLIAM "POTATOES" DADDANO

CHARLES NICOLETTI

CURTIS A. HESTER of the follöwing: * U

He stated that approximately three weeks pre-

vious, two men known to him only as SCOTTY STEVENSON

(phonetic) and BILL ROBERTSON (phonetic), had talked to

him at great length concerning his past background. He

stated that ROBERTSON was allegedly a local bondsman, and

that SCOTTY stated that he was a local parole and probation

officer.

Since that time, CI has learned that these two

men are working hand-and-hand with West Side hoodlums,

"CHUCKIE". NICOLETTI, "JU JU" GRIECO, TONY SPILATRO and

"These men meet practically

every evening from about 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in the

Garden Lounge in the Bismark Hotel.U

Since the original meeting with STEVENSON and

ROBERTSON, they have sounded out CI concerning his willing-

ness to work for them, type of work not stated during first

part of their conversation

However, on November 7, 1960,

CI met these men, and arrangements were made for him to

work for them on Monday evenings, which is the one night a

week that CI has off.

The nature of his duties was more

fully explained to him at this time. It seems that there

are certain "pick-ups"

efforts, he will be paid a "C-Note"

that el must make and that for his

every Monday evening.

It is known to CI that

these men are

involved in bookie

operations on the West Side and Forest Park, Illinois.

It is also known to CI that ROBERTSON and STEVENSON are

very strongly associated with the top hoodlum echelon of

organized crime on the West Side of Chicago. CI pointed

out that during the various conversations with these men,

they have gone to great lengths to determine his background

and his associates while he lived in the Southern part of

Ilinois, some years ago. When they determined that h

nad been closely associated with a leading Danville bookie

by the name of WARREN WHITE, that seemed to certify him in

their exes as one they could trust.

WARREN WHITE has recently completed serving a sentence in

the Federal Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, for income

tax evasion. U

In their most recent contact with CI, these

men appeared to trust him 100% and while they have not

told him specifically what type of "pick-ups" he is to

make, he assumes that for the most part, it will be money

owed the "syndicate" on the West Side.

He feels that they

believe that he is better qualified to handle some of their

contacts than the men listed above.

He pointed out for

example, that TONY SPILATRO is a young "punk" who is trigger

happy, impulsive, and therefore, not suited for certain

types of operations in which these men are involved. y

CI stated that the following Monday, November 14,

1960, he is to meet these men at Gus' Steak House of Cicero,

located at 4817 Roosevelt Road in Cicero, Illinois.

pointed out that this steak house is owned by SAM "MOONEY"

GIANCANA, and that it is run by à fellow known to him only

He stated that in the past, he has been invited

on several occasions to their upstairs gambling den and has

seen many prominent West Side hoodlums partaking of the

pleasures afforded

them in this place.

During

the above conversation with these men,

CI was asked what bookie he used, as well as other employees

of Topper's Restaurant, where he

is manager. He stated that

he used a bookie named GOLD, and they admonished him for

using the bookie out of their territory, and suggested

strongly that he make full use of their

service in the future

as well as the other employees at Topper's. CI was given

permission by these men to personally take bets for their

group in the future up to the amount of $5,000.00. U

During the last conversation

which occurred

on election night, November 8, 1960, these men were

checking every ten or fifteen minutes, by phone, with

election headquarters, to determine how DANIEL WARD was

fairing in the contest.

It seems WARD, who was running

for States Attorney for Cook County, is the man who the

would win, these men were quite elated, which indicated

to CI that

the organized crime in Chicago felt WARD could

be controlled by them after he assumed office in the near

future.

CI stated that on the evening of November 10,

1960, STEVENSON and ROBERTSON were to fly to Las Vegas,

Nevada, with two local judges and three or four city

officials, names not devulged to CI. They were to be gone

for only three or four days, after which time they would

return to Chicago. U

ROCCO PRANO

PCI RALPH KOLLY, Elgin, Illinois, advised on

September 28, 1960, that for approximately the last four

weeks, "ROCKY" PRAND and his associates have stayed away

from Kane County entirely.

He stated that business is slow

in the county and PRANO is doing nothing to push business

in any way.

KELLY advised that at the present time the

Aurora-Kane County Amusement Company, a company that

he

and PRANO are entered as paper partners in, has only 40

bowling machines operating and nine pinball machines

opera-

ting and the machines are

only located in Dundee and South

Elgin, Illinois.

KELLY stated that PRANO, along with a person who

goes under the name of MIKE MARINO, has opened the "key Club",

located on the

Southeast corner of North Avenue and wannheim

Road, Stone Park, Illinois. He stated that the club is

supposed to actually be owned by PRANO and MARINO; about whom

he knows nothing. He added that the club is small, only

holding about 40 people and when in the club, a short while agò

could see no evidence of gambling.

It was further related by KELLY that it appears

that WILLIE "POTATOES" DADDANO, who formerly had exclusive

Illinois, has

rights to MeHenry, Kane and DuPage County: "MOONEY" GIANCANA

apparently lost out in his fight with SAM

for the territory and GIANCANA now has exclusive rights to

the area.

He stated that both PRANO and TONY PIROTTI, who

served in the same capacity as PRANO in DuPage County, were

DADDANO's men and from what he has learned, PIROTTI is out

entirely in DuPage County and at the present time he and

DADDANO are operating a jukebox route out of Freeport, Illinois.

He stated that PIROTTI who resides in DuPage County, is only

supposed to spend his week ends in Du Page County and during

in the

county on the machines under DADDANO, is still serving in

the same capacity, however, COHEN only spends two days a week

in Kane County, and at that time he leaves as rapidly as

possible after his work is complete. M

KELLY stated that he is of the opinion that either

PRANO and the others have done something wrong in the county

or they are going to attempt to start something new.

He

that business is so poor due to all the law enforcement

authorities in the county clamping down on PRANO, that he made

a special trip to the Key Club requesting PRANO to tell his

superiors to let him (KELLY), and CLARENCE LAMBERT, no used
