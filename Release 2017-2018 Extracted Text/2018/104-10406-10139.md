ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM:

“Rescission: Annex B of Chapter II, CSHB 70-1-T, 27 October 1966

1, INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

_tively' small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a Voluine’ of ‘corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE £01 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201- system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as'identifying file number for reporting on that
individual,

b, The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie., per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects.

i ¢. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generatéd by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Tadex Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines witl be moved up and the ref-
erence ‘consolidated.

e. OI Code: 2 two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record: the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as‘well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OL
codes for use. by components: . : -

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)
(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services

or other specific organizations.

‘A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

S 1 A201 personality riay be assigtied two OI codes. An o code may be assigned

-” “when the 201 Personality. File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
~, Paragraph 3b below) by filing in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment. .

‘The 201 system has the capability of producing’ machine ‘listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. .

£. 201 Mackine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER
a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent; in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
‘a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISC. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
hanilbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Genorally dossiers are opened ca ,
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
mis of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
ons for whom provisional operational: approvals and operational approvals
quested (see exception below), 201 files are not to be opened on siaéf
loyees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
‘ments.on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose v
names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2, 201

"dossiers should be ‘opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling ont and submitting
a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of 2 cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by waiting 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dis form and/or after

a. Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers, it will therefore: take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, ie., exact copy(s) of a document.
. (2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
the opening. ce wore .
” (3) All abstract slips.
c (4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884). .
(5) The disseminated version of- positive intelligence information if

a copy of the raw report is contained in the 20] file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

. (6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
. cover sheets unless there ‘are remarks such as coordinations or comments,

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification
authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed, retained
in a desk TS file or forwarded to the Top Secret Controt Officer, and a
cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the location

of the TS document.

sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria; _
» (1) Country of location .
(2) OL codes {organization and/or intelligence affiliation)
{3) Citizenship ‘ : -
(4), Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)
(8) Occupation. io

These selection criteria may ‘be used singly of in combinations.’ For éxample,

‘auser could obtain a’ list of all 201 personalities. who have been assigned: the
Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who were bor in Germany betwéen the years: 1915

|

and. 1920, with the occupation computer specialist; who are now citizens of the
United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.
Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA and those .

with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included, Note also
that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific
as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The’ occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some ‘occupation codes cover moré than one ””

occupation. For example, the occupation. code CRAF covers those who practice’
some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters, bricklayers, painters, mechanics
and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category
will be included in the printout, These non-standard listings may be sorted
(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:
