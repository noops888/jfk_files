On July 29, 1963, JESUS RAFAEL FRANCO

CANEDO, who is under consideration for development as
a PSI by the Miami Office, was contacted in connection
ith another matter by Special Agent JOSEPH P. McCANN.
IFRANCO's identity should be protected, he should be
‘validated as having furnished reliable information in
the past, and he should be described as an ex-member
of the Cuban Revolutionary Army, who is familiar with
anti-CASTRO activities in the Miami area.

/
He advised upon viewing a photograph of MAX :
GARCIA, that this individual has accompanied DOMINICK “S/7
~KGARIONE. during BARTONE's contacts with one LUIS BALBUENA.
NCO said he is quite certain that the photograph of
ees GARCIA is of the individual who accompanies BARTONE, z
ji and who appears to act as his bodyguard. .

The photograph shown to FRANCO and upon which
this identification is based is the photograph dated
December 6, 1955, obtained from the files of the Tampa,
Florida, Police Department #APP 13367.

Miami will obtain additional information con-
cerning GARCIA's association with BARTONE through recon-
tact with FRANCO, and Tampa will be advised.
