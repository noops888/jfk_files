MM97-387

On July 29, 1963, JESUS RAFAEL FRANCO

CANEDO, who is under

consideration for development as

a PSI by the Miami Office, was contacted in connection

with another matter by Special Agent JOSEPH P. MCCANN.

FRANCO's identity should be protected, he should be

validated as having furnished reliable information in

the past, and he should be described as an ex-member

of the Cuban Revolutionary Army, who is familiar with

anti-CASTRO activities in the Miami

area.

He advised upon viewing a photograph of MAX

GARCIA, that this individual has accompanied DOMINICK

¿BARTONE during BARTONE's contacts with one LUIS BALBUENA.

FRANCO said he is quite certain that the photograph of

(MAX GARCIA is of the individual who accompanies BARTONE,

and who appears to act as his bodyguard.

USTi

The photograph shown to FRANCO and upon which

this identification is based is the photograph dated

December 6, 1955, obtained from the files of the Tampa,

Florida, Police Department #APP 13367•

Miami will obtain additional information con-

cerning GARCIA's association with BARTONE through recon-

tact with FRANCO, and Tampa will be advised.
