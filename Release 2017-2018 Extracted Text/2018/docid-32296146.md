On 2/28/61, SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, observed GABRIEL MANNARINO's
cottage, located on Old Leechburg Read, R. D. $3, Leechburg, Pa.,
and 1¢ appears as though construction is completed. This means
the cottage now has five rooms; three bedrooms, a living room -
dining room, and a kitchen; and it also hes a fairly jarge
soreened porch, Nobody was noted in the area, and no cars were
observed in the driveway or parking area, but the three German
shetieed dogs were in the cutdeor pen to the rear and right of
the cottage. No telephone line was observabie, and PCI HERBERT
LEB RAY, who lives across the road from the cottage was not
available for interview.

Because of previously set forth information to the effect that

GABRIEL MANNARING spends considerable time at this cottage, has

many visitors at odd hours of the night, and may move into it as
a permanent residence, Pittsburgh plane te make every effort to

guegbligh whether or net highly confidential coverage can be ef-
e there,
