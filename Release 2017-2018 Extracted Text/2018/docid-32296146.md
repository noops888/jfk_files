three bedrooms, a

Living roon -

screened porch.

Nobody was noted in the area, and no care were

observed in the driveway or parking area, but

the three Gernan

shetherd dogs were in the outdoor pen to the rear and rigat of

the cottage.

No telephone line was observable, and PCI HERBERT

LEE RAY, who lives across the road from the cottage

was not

avallable for interview.

Because of previously set forth information to the effect that

GABRIEL MANNARINO spends considerable time at this cottage,

has

many visitors at odd hours of the night, and may move into it as

a permanent residence,

Pittsburgh plans

to make every effort to

eatablish whether or not highly confidential coverage can be ef-

feeted there.
