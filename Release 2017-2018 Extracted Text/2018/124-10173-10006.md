PERMITTED. BY MEXICAN AUTHORITIES TO SEE AND TALK WITH ALVARADO

FOR THE FIRST TIMES CONVEBSATI ON TOOK PLACE IN PRESENCE OF TWO

MEXICAN POICE OFFICERS.

SAYS THAT ALVARADO WENT BACKS

TO HIS ORIGINAL STORY OF HAVING WITNESSED PAY-OFF TO OSWALD

IN CUBAN CONSULATE HERE•

ALVARADO CLAIMS HIS STATEMENT TO

MEXICAN AUTHORITIES WAS

MADE UNDER DURESS AFTER FORTY-EIGHT HOURS

OF CONJANUOUS INTERROGATION•

HE ALSO CLAIMS MEXICAN OFFICERS

THREATENED PHYSICAL VI OLENCE IF HE DID NOT SIGN STATEMENT.

EARLIER ON DECEMBER 2 MEXICAN POLICE HAD TURNED ALVARADO OVER

ALTHOUGH MEXICANS CLAIM THAT ALVARADO WAS TREATED

"GENTLY," SI NE

NOUS FFICIAL WAS PRESENT WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THERE

LAS REPORTED EARLIER ALVARADO'S STORY IMPRESSED US HERE BECAUSE OF

WEALTH OF DETAIL. I DID NOT IN

THE BEGINNING KNOW THAT ALVARADO

HAD DEFINITELY FIXED DATE OF PASSAGE OF MONEY. TO OSWALD AS

SECRE I

-2- 1226, DECEMBER 3, NOON FROM MEXICO CITY.

LIBRARY ON 'SEPTEMBER**19.

SINCE ALVARADO ALLEGEDLY STUCK TO THE

SEPTEMBER

18 DATE DURING MEXICAN INTERROGATION UP TO THE TIME HE

« CHANGED HIS STORY AND SINCE WE CANNOT PLACE OSWALD ON EASTERN

AIRLINES FLIGHT FROM AND TO NEW ORLEANS BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 17 AND

19 THERE IS ONE APPARENT FLAW IN ALVARADO'S STORY•

A SECOND APPARENT FLAW, ALREADY MENTIONED, IS ALVARADO'S INSISTENCE

THAT HE TELEPHONED AMERICAN EMBASSY FOUR TIMES ON SEPTEMBER 2D

AND DAYS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING •

PALVARADO

CURRENTLY CLAIMS HE MADE FOUR TELEPHONE CALLS- TO EMBASSY EXTENSION

E13 JOUSING NAME OF JORGE KYNAUT (PHONETIC), AND WAS EACH IDEN

REBUFFED BY A "WOMAN. "

THIS IS THE NUMBER

OF THE EMBASSY SECURITY

FICER TO WHICH ALVARADO WAS REFERRED WHEN HE TELEPHONED THE

EMBASSY

ON- NOVEMBER 25.

HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE TEXTENSI O

NUMBER FROM THE NOVEMBER 25 CALL• WE ARE CONTINUING TO. INVESTIGATE

THIS FACET BUT EARLIER, MORE GENERAL INQUIRY (PRODUCED NEGATIVE

RESULTS.

NEVERTILLESS THERE IS SUFFICIENT POSSIBILITY OF TRUTH IN THEEPART

OF ALVARÁDO'S STORY ABOUT HAVING SEEN MONEY PASSED TO OSWALD TO

LARRANT CONTINUED INVESTIGATION OF ALVARADO EITHER IN THE U

I NA NICA RAGUA

SAYS THAT NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT ISID

AGREEABLE TO ALVARADO!S INTERROCATI ON IN NICARAGUA BY US OFFICIALS

I THEREFORE SUGGEST THAT FBI AND CIA CONSIDER SENDING REPRESENTATIVES

TO MANAGUA FOR INTERROGATION

PRUPOSES. *PERHAPS A POLYGRAPH

EXPERT SHOULD ALSO BE SENT.
