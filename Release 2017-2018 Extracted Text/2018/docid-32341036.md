Co Re Bureau letter to Miami dated 12/12/66. q-

i Numerous efforts have been made by the Miami Office
since receipt of referenced Bureau letter to contact SANTIA

in order to determine whether or not SANTIAGO is in a position
to furnish information of value to the criminal intelligence
program, particularly that relating to Swiss banks; however, thé
office of the Interchange Bank of Chiasso, Switzerland, in the
Ainsly Building, Mian, Florida, has been noted to be

unoccupied at the present time. SANTIAGO is out of the

Miami area and his whereabouts are unknown.

Continued efforts will be made to contact
SANTIAGO in Miami to determine his potential as an
informant in consonance with referenced Bureau letter.
