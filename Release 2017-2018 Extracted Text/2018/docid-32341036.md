Re Miami letter to Bureau 1/11/67.

Efforts to locate SANTIAGO in Miami have been

unproductive. He has space in the Ainsley Building, Miami,

under the name of SAM BENSON and Associates, however, it

would appear to be a front, since there are people in this

office only on rare occasions.

with the office for SANTIAGO to contact the FBI Office in

Miami, however, these messages have gone unanswered.

In view of the above, this matter is considered

closed.
