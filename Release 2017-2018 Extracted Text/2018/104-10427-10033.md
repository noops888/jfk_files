MEMORANDUM FOR: George Frates

Chief, Records Systems Branch, RMD

FROM

: Jon E. Wolfe, RSB

SUBJECT : Status of Records Related to the HSCA Investigation

Attached for your perusal is the draft of an item scheduling

the CIA's HSCA-related records.

I suggest that this item be added to

the OLC records control schedule (as a restricted item) and submitted to

NARS for formal disposition approval.

(Col. Tagge of NARS has reviewed

the draft item and its disposition and is in basic agreement.)

You will note that the proposed item addresses both film and

paper records.

The film duplicates those records which must be returned

to their original locations. All other records, such as those which

have already been duplicated on paper and those which were generated as

the result of the investigation will not be filmed.

3. Filming is currently underway in the DDO and is being done by

Din, I believe, a new location on the sixth floor.

DO is not only filming and verifying its own files but also those of

the Office of Personnel. One estimate I have heard is that it will

require the DDO about one year to complete the job.

Filming is also either underway or being planned in the Office

of Security.

This process will be overseen by Jack Sullivan. The only

other film we have consists of DDS&T footage on the U-2. I have been

told that the latter is probably part of a permanent record series. If

it is, I suggest that it not be duplicated but rather cross-referenced

in our deposit.

Records that will be retired as paper are located in NFAC,

I suggest that each of the holding components be respon-

sible for boxing, shelf listing, and sealing their respective records

and that all be retired under one job number. I further suggest that

once we are in our new vaulted area (sometime in December?) that we

serve as the focal point for collecting and depositing these records.

If you concur with the attached records schedule item and the

substance of the above, I suggest that both be coordinated with the

other interested parties throughout the Agency.

If no significant

problems are found, I will then see that the new item is submitted to

NARS.
