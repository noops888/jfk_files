CRITICAL, AND HE IS STARTING TO MANEUVER TO REGAIN
GROUND,

2, CASTRO'S INVESTIGATION OF JOAQUIN ORDOQUI MESA WAS THE
AFTERMATH OF AND DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MARCH 1964 TRIAL OF MARCOS
ABMANDO RODRIGUEZ ALFONSO. ORDOQUI WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRO-
CEEDINGS AXD HE REFUSED TO LET MATTERS REST, ORDOQUI CONTINUED TO
EXPRESS IRRITATION ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRIAL HAD BEEN
BAXDLED, AND HIS CRITICAL ATTITUDE CONTRIBUTED TO CASTRO'S BRINGING

MATTERS TO A HEAD,
3. CASTRO'S PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING THE “OLD GUARD" COSIMUN-

ISTS IS THAT THEY ARE SO DISLIKED BY THE MASSES, BY KEEPING THEY,
HOWEVER, CASTRO GIVES HIMSELF MANEUVERING GROUND, CASTRO REALIZES

HE MUST ACT AGAINST THE “OLD GUARD" COMMUNISTS Wi7H RUSTRAINT IN

ORDER NOT TO CREATE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE SOVIETS, THE LAST
THING CASTRO WANTS IS AN UNCONTROLLED CRISIS EITHER WITH THE SOVIETS

‘

OR WITHIN THE REGIME.
4. CASTRO'S MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL, AND LABOR,

LAZARO PENA GONZALEZ, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CENTRAL DE TRABAJA-
DORES DE CUBA REVOLUCIONARIA (REVOLUTIONARY CUBAN WORKERS' ORCANIZA-
TION, CTC-R) IS SLATED TO BE REMOVED, BUT ONLY CASTRO WILL SAY WHEN,

CARLOS RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTO NACIONAL
DE LA REFORMA AGRARIA (NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRARIAN REFORM, INRA) ’
HAS ALSO HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITH CASTRO, THE INRA IS A "MESS" BUT IT j

IS DOUBTFUL THAT ANYONE CAN SUCCEED IN THE JOB, AND IT IS UNLIKELY

THAT CASTRO WILL ESCALATE THE CRISIS BY A MOVE AGAINST RODRIGUEZ AT
THIS TIME, (SOURCE COMMENT: CASTRO ONCE SAID THAT HE WILL NOT
PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE PRESSURED BY ANYONE AND WILL REPLACE OFFICIALS
ONLY WHEN HE DESIRES TO DO SO. AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 1963 CASTRO
WAS PLANNING TO REMOVE AUGUSTO MARTINEZ SANCHEZ AS MINISTER OF LABOR
AT A CONVENIENT TIME, THUS HIS RECENT ACTION AGAINST MARTINEZ MAY
REPRESENT THE REALIZATION OF A YEAR-OLD INTENTION.) CASTRO'S
PROBLEMS WITH THE MILITARY HAVE BEEN LESS SERIOUS. ACTION TAKEN
AGAINST MILITARY OFFICERS HAS BEEN ON DISCIPLINARY, NOT POLITICAL
GROUNDS, AS IN THE CASE OF THE DISMISSAL OF CAPTAIN JOSE AGUSTIN
“TINTIN" DIAZ-ARGUELLES,
