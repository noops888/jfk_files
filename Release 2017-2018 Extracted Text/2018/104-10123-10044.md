1. Hede MASSING's! Zegearch project mentioned in reference appears
in the opinion of @he Hague)Station to be one which should stand on its
own feet and not be supported solely because it is one of particular
interest to the GiPATETZERS) and carried out by subject for them. ;

2. When Hede MASSING was in an Hague) she mentioned to GrmPaTuIZER/11 )
that she could approach people in(foliand)as in any other country in
Europe more gracefully if she had some'sort of cover in which to cloak
her real interest. In the context of this discussion, she said, as de-
scribed in paragraph 1 of reference, that she once was going to conduct
Tesearch together with her husband into the motivation which prompted
the defection of approximately 100 Communists who may or may not have
made public their break from Communist or Soviet espionage. She stated
that this project collapsed because the organization which was about to
support it itself collapsed before she could get launched. She cited
this as the type of project under which sHe could make the type of
approaches in which the SYMPATHIZERS were interested.’ Approaches
of this nature in Folland) might amount to ten or fifteen but no mores

@| 3. The above was the nature of the conversation between her and the
SYMPATEIZERs) with respect to this matter. Therefore, if such a project
is to be supported by KUBARK, Fagg would be inclined to think it should
be done only if KUBARK feels that the project in itself is of merit as
a propaganda vehicle and as a means of contacting this type of person to |
get their full story.in other places as well as(Holland. The (GisParstame)
would certainly benef{t from it in the manner above described but did not at
all anticipate that so extensive a project would be undertaken solely
because they have a somewhat limited interest in it.

4. We will discuss this matter witu Lavell and MASSING when they
arrive in (fol tang) on or about 24 September 1958.
