Hode WAsSInG rascarch project mentioned in reference a ypeare

in the opinion of The Hague Station to be one which should stand on its

own feet and not be supported solely because it is one of particular

interest to the @MPATHing) sad cat it out by subject for then.

2. When Hede MASSING was in The Hague) she mentioned to (SYMPATHIZIR/11)

that she could approach people infolland as in any other country ir

surope more gracelully if she had sone

'aort of cover in which to cloak

her real interest. In the context of this discussion, she said, as de-

scribed in paragraph I of reference, that she once was going to conduct

research together with her husband into the motivation which prompted

the defection of approximately 100 Communists who may or may not have

made public their break from Communist or Soviet espionage. She stated

that this project collapsed because the organization which was about to

support it itself collapsed before she could get launched. She oited

this as the type of project under which she could make the type of

approaches in which the (SYMPATiVERe were interested. Approaches

of this nature in folland might amount to ten or fifteen but no more.

The above was the nature of the conversation between her and the

(SYMPATETZERs) with respect to this matter. Therefore, if such a projact

is to be supported by KUBARK, fagg would be inclined to think it should

be done only if KUBARK feels that the project in itself is of merit as

a propaganda vehicle and as a means of contacting this type of person to

set their full story in other places as well as (holland.

The (SYPATHIZERs)

would certainly benefit from it in the manner above described but did not at

all anticipate that so extensive a project would be undertaken solely

because they have a somewhat limited interest in 1to
