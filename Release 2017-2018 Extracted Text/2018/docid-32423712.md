IDEAS TO EXPLOIT CUBAN VULNERABILII

Ac. of So Intelligense, br

IDEA

Establish and support in whole or in part, a free Cuban govern-

ment in exile with a constitutional bill of rights, an objective of

overthrowing Communism in Cuba, and, if possible, its own armed

forces, radio stations, religious leaders, labor leaders, educators,

fraternal groups, and territory (Isle of Pines). As a minimum, the

framework of a free Cuban government should be established as a

"cover" for U.S. "overt" and "covert" activities utilizing Cuban

personnel or units.

Remove Castro and/or other key political leaders by assassina-

tion, kidnapping, bribery or by placing a bounty on them. Encourage

defections and strengthen Defector Program.

Character assassination of Castro and other key leaders.

Identify for exploitation persons who are anti-Castro/Communist.

Encourage and pressure Free World Nations to "isolate" Cuba

from economic

support in order to increase the cost and difficulty

of support by Russia, and to cause dissatisfaction within Cuba.

Destroy or harass Cuban fishing fleets at sea by ALPHA 66 or

other groups.

Destroy by sabotage sugar cane, sugar mills, POL storage and

distribution, international and domestic communications and key road

and rail bottlenecks.

Initiate biologica

(except human)

Flar

resetable and animal tissue

Prevent repair parts for U.S. machinery and vehicles from

reaching Cuba.

Resume Refugee flights on a restrictive basis to encourage

exodus of trained professional and/or technical personnel to further

weaken economy.

Disseminate counterfeit currency, ration cards, etc.

Manufacture and disseminate, through appropriate channels,

defective repair parts for U.S. machinery and vehicles in Cuba.

* Ideas which could be implemented in approximately six months.

IDEA

Reinstate Naval quarantine of Cuba,

as required, in order to

discourage economic support by Free World and or uncommitted

nations.

Fabricate incidents to encourage harmful retaliation against

Castro such as:

a. Explode a U-2 aircraft over Cuba thereby

encouraging U.s.

military retaliation.

b. Attack of lu. sor free Moria shipby "Cuban" ship or

6(1(B)+(c)

aircraft thereby encouraging economic sanctions, blockade and

adverse public opinion.

c. Establish a

"black" radio station and broadcast Castro/

Communist revolutionary appeals and suggestions to selected

Communist groups in certain Latin American countries thereby

encouraging anti-Communist actions by Latin American countries.

d. Establish a "black" radio stationina elected latin (BA(e)

American count ryl and broadcast

themes to support Castro and over-

throw OAS governments to other countries.

e.

Activate and support mercenary "pirate" attacks against

Cuban coastal shipping.

f. Activate and support mercenary "commando" attacks against

vital coastal targets in Cuba.

Prepare and uncover, in an appropriate manner, official

Cuban Castro documents showing Communist intent to overthrow

selected Latin American countries.

Since Castro constantly refers to Cuba as the only truly free

territory in the Americas demand U. N. observed free elections.

Continue demands for on-site inspections.

Influence Soviet public opinion and Soviet leaders of the

futility and burden of their supporting the current regime in Cuba

thus contribüting to the downfall of Castro.

Prepare plan to harm mental and physical health Castro and key

leaders.

Prepare a plan for the harassment of Soviet installations and

personnel.

Attack mutual confidence among Cuban leaders by creating doubts

as to their individual objectives and loyalties.
