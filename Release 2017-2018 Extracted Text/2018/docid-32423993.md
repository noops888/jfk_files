I FEBRUARY 1962

COVER AND DECEPTION

1. General Situation:

a. The Department of Defense has been directed to take

action to disrupt the Cuban sugar cane harvest.

In order to

achieve this mission, it is necessary to interfere with the

civilian labor force

to

the extent that they would be unable to

conduct

or support the

harvest.

b. The sugar harvest period is 15 January through 15 April.

The most critical period is from 1 February to 1 April.

Therefore time is of the essence.

c. A general

call-up of the Cuban militia would have a

deleterious effect upon the Cuban sugar harvest by reducing the

size of the available labor force.

d. Enclosure 1 is an outlined plan for the test of CINCLANT

Cuban Contingency Operation Plans simultaneously with a test of

CINCONAD's plan for the defense of southern Florida (Southern

Tip, CONAD OPORD 1-61).

e. Procedures and command relationships outlined or directed

by this plan effect only this plan and do not effect nor

constitute a precedent for future command arrangements.

I. Assumptions:

(1) Information can be passed to the Government of

Cuba that the test of CINCLANT Contingency Plans and the test

of the Air Defense of

southern Florida is in reality a cover

for an invasion of Cuba by the United States.

(2) The conduct

of

the operations involving the test

of the contingency

operation plans

and the air defense

of

southern Florida will

cause Castro to call-up militia for

the defense of Cuba.

(3) The call-up of the militia will disrupt the

sugar cane harvest to

a major degree.

2. Mission:

a. CINCLANT and CINCONAD will plan for and execute the

simultaneous tests of CINCLANT Contingency Operation Plans

314/316-61 and CINCONAD Operation Order 1-61 in accordance

wi.th

Enclosure 1. CINCSTRIKE, CINCPAC and other

theatre

QUEMENT AND

and force commanders will support as directed borein.

b. Information will be passed through appropriate

channels

to the Government of Cuba that these tests are, in reality,

a cover for the invasion of Cuba by the United States. It is

recognized that this information may result in an alert

of Cuban forces thus tending to jeopardize a successiul

accomplishment of the OPLAN 314/316-61 mission, if the OPLAN

were to be necessarily executed. However, any Cuban

mobilization thus engendered might cause a related economic

harassment, considered an underlying desirable result.

c. Normal publicity will be given to the test operations.

Foreign observers will be invited if practicable. Although

SOLIDARITY I, conducted in 1961, was attended by high level

Latin American officials, a similar group should be invited

to observe the Vieques

demonstration; on a l-day show of

progress in armament,

technique, materiels, equipment, and

procedures.

Their presence in

the area

as guests of the US

would tend

to give an air of Western Hemisphere solidarity to

this portion of the exercises.

d. The operation will be conducted in early March 1962,

if basic task remains to be disruption of the sugar harvest.

If policy considerations, military impracticality, or other

factors affect the timing of a policy decision (required by

12 February 1962), alternative slippage dates of 1 May 1962, to

coincide with the Communist "May Day" celebration (a time which

would find a semi-military alert, probably not desirable yet

possible quite concentrated in the Havana area), or 26 July 1962

which would coincide with "Castro" Day (again confronting a

semi-mobilized situation but which imaginatively could be

interpreted as a deliberate taunt to Castro). Other dates are

under study. Additional guidance concerning slippage dates will

be provided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff if the arrangement of

other currently scheduled exercises conflicting with this plan

make changes militarily or politically desirable.

3. Operations:

a. Concept:

(1) Enclosure 1 directs CINCLANT and CINCONAD to

prepare operation orders for the testing of CINCLANT OPLANS

314/316-61 in conjunction with a test of CINCONAD Opord 1-61.

b. Phases of Operations:

(1) Deception

(2) Alert CINCLANT, CINCONAD, CINCSTRIKE, and CINCARIB.

(3) Alerting and Prepositioning of Forces

(4) Maneuvers

(5) Withdrawal of CONAD forces

(6) US Courses of Action if Attacked

(7) Withdrawal of CINCLANT forces

(8) Cover

c. Phase I - Deception

(1) Tasks - To cause the Cuban ruling body to believe

that

an attack/invasion

' is imminent.

(2) Concept - To be

accomplished through pre-planned

leaks.

DocId: 32423993

(a) Deception Story - Covertly release to reliable

Cuban agents

a deception story that an invasion of Cuba is going

to take place under the guise of an air defense exercise.

in the Southeast US area to test the US Air Defense:

(e) CINCLANI will make provision for carrier and

land based fighter escort in support of the CONAD Target

Fleet aircraft as outlined in Annexes A and B to Enclosure 1.

Basically, the fighter escort will be provided from the time

the Target Fleet elements approach within fifty (50) nautical

miles of the Cuban land mass until they enter the coastal ADIZ.

Close air cover operations will also be made available to support

AEW & C and ELINI operations on an "as required" basis. In the

event that CONAD (ADC Target Fleet and AEW & C) aircraft are

attäcked by the Cuban Revolutionary Air Force (CRAF), escort

aircraft will take action in accordance with Appendix I to

Annex A to Enclosure 1. CINCLANT fighter escort will carry

live loads with ammunition fed into the chambers. All pilots,

will be briefed on and adhere to the "Rules of Engagement" as

specified in Appendix I to Annex A to Enclosure 1.

(f) Prior, during and subsequent to the above

operations, intelligence information will be gained by all means.

Elements of TAC perforning ELINT operations will comply with

Annex D to Enclosure I. Target aircraft crews will be provided

with cameras. ELINT aircraft, shipborne and land-based communi-

cations will actively seek out and retain intelligence

information.

(g) In the event that CONAD (ADC Target Fleet)

aircraft are attacked by CRAF elements, they will evade away

from the Cuban coast and terminate their participation in the

exercise.

See Implementation Schedule - Annex E.

j. Phase VIII - Cover

(1) Tasks - Io mold world opinion that the United States

forces

conducted routine

exercise aimed

at determining

defensive capabilities of the forces deployed to the southeast

US. Target aircraft flew routes over the Atlantic Ocean and

Caribbean Sea to simulate enemy bombers approaching military

and civilian targets in the southeast US and at no time

penetrated Cuban airspace.

(2) Concept - In the unlikely event that Cuban authorities

would make no protest, release to the press within two hours

after maneuvers time a prepared statement announcing a routine

air defense exercise of the forces in the southeast United

States.

No mention should be made of the proximity of the

target routes to the Cuban land mass.

(a) Should the Cuban government protest concerning

provocation or violation of Cuban airspace, the United States

should

make an emphatic denial, setting forth as a major

effect the fact that radar control aircraft were positioned over

international waters

at least 50 to 100 miles from the Cuban

land mass

assure positive control of US aircraft, to provide

navigational assistance and to preclude a violation of Cuban

airspace.

However, it was necessary to

deploy the target

fleet overseas and to transit overwater routes in order to

exercise the air defense capability of US fleet units

also to simulate the routes that might be flown by a force

attacking US targets in the US. If aggression by the 'Cuban

forces

is attempted, immediate protests through Press, UN, and

State Department

channels should be made from prepared

statements or

releases.

(b) Advance press releases should be prepared to reveal

that an air defense tactical evaluation of the forces deployed

to defend the lis is being or was conducted

using the target fleet

of USAF ADC B-57 aircraft. These aircraft were specially

modified as target aircraft,

unarmed and with bomb bays

sealed to provide space for special equipment used in evaluations

and to provide a realistic environment for training of the air

defense forces. Further, it was necessary to fly near but

outside of the recognized Cuban airspace to add realism to

a simulated attack against US fleet units as well as US

targets. In addition, special actions were taken by radar

controlling aircraft to provide navigational assistance on the

overwater portions of the routes flown by the target fleet

and to prevent inadvertent penetration of recognized Cuban

airspace.

NIK¢NAME :

References: a. CINCLANT CONTINGENCY OPLANS 314-61 and '316-61

D. CINCONAD OPORD 1-61 (Southern Ilp)

1. Situation

a. General

(1) The Cuban Revolution of 1959 under the leadership of

Fidel Castro, a self-professed communist, has resulted in the

growth of a full-fledged

communist satellite in the Western

Henisphere.

Through Soviet economic, illitary and technical

assistance, the military structure in Cuba has rapiary

developed into a threat to the US and other Western Hemisphere

nations. Soviet Colonial Empire and Chinese communiso

infiltration of influence, personnel, and military equipment

is expected to proceed at an increased tempo.

Effective

governmental control over the institutions and dajly life

of the Cuban people is likely to increase, making effective

internal opposition more difficult and risky. There is no

foreseeable development in the internal economic or

political

situation which would be likely to bring about

a critical shift of popular opinion away from the present

government. On the contrary, all indications are that the

existing communist ruling body in Cuba will consolidate its

dominant political position, and will continue to present a

constant threat of harassment and a potential base for

hostile actions against the US. This threat will increase with

the passage of time.

(2) Incident to the communist threat presented by Cuba,

CINCLANT has been directed to and has

prepared contingency

plans for execution in the event that the JCS determine

that US military operations in Cuba are necessary. (Reference a)

(3) Incident to the communist threat presented by Cuba,

CINCONAD has been directed to and has prepared and implemented

plans for an increased air defense capability in the southeast

United States area. (Reference b)

(4) In the event of US-Cuban overt military hostilities, it

is probable that both CINCLANT contingency operations and

CINCONAD air defense operations would be required and conducted

concurrently.

(5) In accordance with existing directives that require

military forces to be exercised and evaluated to determine

their capability to perform their assigned mission,

and in order

to practice the coordination required in the event of US-Cuban

overt military hostilities, this Outline Plan provides for the

conduct of concurrent CINCLANT/CINCONAD exercised which will

accomplish the following:

(a) Test and evaluate CINCLANT Contingency OPLANS

314-61 and 316-61 as realistically and thoroughly as possible,

utilizing a joint airborne/amphibious task force in the

Caribbean area.

(b) Test and evaluate CINCONAD Operation Order 1-61

forces assigned.

FORCES AND

NOPORNOR CINCLANE SPECIAL HANDLING

1. Forces

a. CINCLANT will plan for exercising all of the forces

currently listed in CINCLANT OPLAN 314-61. The General concept

in paragraph 2 below indicates forces to be deployed, forces

to be repositioned, forces to be alerted, etc.

b. In addition to the above, CINCLANT will plan with

COMTAC for the exercise of COMTAC electronic reconnaissance

aircraft and air rescue aircraft as required in the Cuban

area to support the joint exercises. It is estimated that

five electronic reconnaissance aircraft will be required for

a three-day period and three air rosoue aircraft will be required

for

a one-day period.

2. General Concept

CINCLANT's directives in compliance with this outline

plan will support

the following general concept:

a. A realistic tactical evaluation of CINCLANT'S

OPLAN 314-61 is required.

b. "C-Day" will be the term used for the day that US

military forces commence the exercise initial assault. This

will be the same day on which CONCONAD faker aircraft

conduct their simulated attack on southeastern US.

c. C-day operations will include amphibious assault,

air drop, and air landed (if feasible) operations at Viegues.

a. Operations at Vieques will include one PHIBRON with

embarked Marine and Army elements, Army airborne elements,

and required air and

sea support.

e. About C-22 days, CINCLANT will request those PACOM forces

designated in CINCLANT OPLANS 314-61 to be deployed enroute to

Lantcon.

between CINCLANT and CINCSTRIKE. These forees will be used

in the Vieques

area, the North Carolina area deployed to loading/

staging areas, or alerted at home base as CINCLANT requests in

order to realistically teet his contingency plan.

k. CINCLANT will

request required MSTS forces in

sufficient time to make them available for operations envisaged

in CINCLANT OPIAN 314-61. Although conditions may preclude all

the individual MSTS ships from active participation, in order

FORCES AND CONCEPT FOR CINCONAD

1. FORCES

a. CINCONAD shall plan for exercising those of his

forces he considers necessary for a realistic tactical

evaluation of his air defense capability in the southeastern

United States area. In general these forces will be:

(1) Approximately thirty-four faker aircraft to

conduct simulated air attacks.

Four airborne early warning and control aircraft

to

provide navigational assistance to overwater aircraft.

(3) Forces of the Montgonery Air Defense Sector as

required.

2. GENERAL CONCEPI. CINCONAD*s directives in compliance

with this outline plan will support the following general

concept.

a. CONAD (USAF ADC target fleet)

aircraft will fly

predetermined routes.

(1) A flight of 19 B-57 aircraft out of Iyndall AFB,

will fly to approximately 10 miles off the Northeast

coast of the Yucatan Peninsula and then head for the

West coast of Cuba. Upon reaching a point approximately

10 miles off shore, the aircraft will turn to maintain

a track that will parallel the North coast of Cuba

approximately 10 miles off shore. Upon reaching a

position directly south of Key West, the aircraft will turn

North and recover at Key West NAS, Homestead or MacDill

AFB.

(2) The 15 B-57 aircraft being scheduled out of

Ramey AFB will initially fly southerly and then head for

CINCLANT Vieques Joint Task Force; then changing to

Rico; taking a course to the North of the island of

Hispaniola: then heading directly toward military

and governmental targets in Cuba. Upon reaching a

point approximately 10 miles off shore (initiating

turns at 15 miles), the aircraft will alter course to

maintain a track parallel to the North coast of Cuba

approximately 10 miles off shore. Jon reaching a

position south of Miami the aircraft will turn North

and recover at Key West NAS, Homestead or McDill AFB.

b. The target force will be launched at a time to have

the forces from

Ramey AFB arrive at the East coasi of Cuba

at

the same time as the target jorces from Tyndai? AFB arrive

at the Nest coast

of Cuba. When in-bound toward CONUS, these

forces will simulate attacks on US targets in the Southeast

U.S. area to test the US air defense.

c. Faker aircraft will at no time approach closer than

10 miles to the Cuban coast. The waves should arrive at IP

10 miles off the Cuban coast at the same time.

d. Time and space factors, as determined by CINCONAD,

will affect the detailed flight plans.

e. CINCONAD will provide sufficient airborne early

Werning and control aircraft off the Cuban coasts to assist

faker aircraft in their navigation to insure that they stay

at least 10 miles from Cuban territory.

f. AEW

and C aircraft will also be exercised in their

AEW and radio relay missions.

g. Provision will be made for positive control to recall

participating forces and to terminate the exercise.

h. CINCLANT fighter escort will carry live loads with

ammunition fed into the chambers. All pilots, however, will

be briefed on the "Rules of Engagement" as specified in

INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION

1. Mission.

Intelligence estimate outlining Cuban offensive and

defensive capabilities and estimating possible Cuban,

Soviet Communist Chinese and South American reactions

and possible courses of action.

2. Situation.

a. General

(1) Cuba has by far the most formidable military

machine, except for its Navy, in the Latin American

area. Cuba is a Communist beachhead

in the defense

system of the Western world, and the Soviet Bloc

nations have put

forth special effort

to entrench

their influence

in the present Cuban

government. It

is apparent that

this government fits very closely into

the world domination plans of the Communist conspiracy.

The amount of control exercised by the Soviet Bloc over

Cuba is unknown, but is probably considerable. A "lend-

lease" arrangement between the Soviet Bloc and Cuba

whereby Cuba furnishes territory for actions against

the US in return for arms and technical assistance

from the Bloc 1s a distinct possibility. There are

believed to be over 500 Soviet Bloc technicians in Cuba

traveling under various guises.

Generally, these

technicians can be broken down into groups as follows:

(a) Soviet - Government advisors, military

construction experts, economic advisors, military

planning and training advisors, and military

equipment instructors - especially instructors for

the jet aircraft which Cuba is receiving from the

USSR.

warfare and camouflage.

(c) Soviet Bloc personnel - Jet fighter instructors,

factory technicians and instructors on use of smaller

military equipment, such as automatic and

anti-aircraft

weapons.

(2) It is conceivable that the military advisors will

play

an important part in decision making if and when

the Cuban

leaders

are faced with the problem

of

whether

or not

an

actual

attack is underway. The Soviets,

being past masters at "brinknanship", might exert a

sobering

influence on such decisions.

(3) The Cubans have trained approximately 200 pilots

to fly MIGS. However, the Cuban pilot training

program is only about 18 months old and it may be

expected that the Cuban fighter pilots are not equal in

ability to pilots of the US forces. In the event of actual

hostilities, it is possible that soviet or Soviet Bloc

pilots flying MIG-19 FARMERS will be encountered.

These pilots are of the instructor category, and would

be flying high performance aircraft with possible

air-to-air missile capability.

(4) The EW/GCI capability of the Cuban military runs the

gamut of radar types from GOS to SCR-627. EW capability

may extend as far out as 250 and possible 350 miles from

the Havana area. The capability of Cuban

radar technicians

and operators is not known; however,

technician and

operator assistance must be expected from Soviet Bloc

instructors in the event of suspected hostilities. This

assistance should provide a marked increase in radar

detection

capability over that of

Cuban operators.

SECRET Little Information 1s available on the GCI/AI

capability of the Cuban Rebel Air Force (CRAF) :

(5) Guerrilla warfare holds a high priority in Cuban

army training. The average. Cuban adapts well to military

life and especially to guerrilla warfare. He is small

in stature but rugged, strong, inured to hardships, and

able to subsist on a simple diet for a long period of

time. It should be expected, therefore, that,

if the Cuban Army were confronted with an unprofitable

military situation it would revert to guerrilla

warfare which could be. long and costly.

(6) The average Cuban fights well while winning, but

may tend to offer less and less

resistance as the

situation becomes

more untenable. The Army is reasonably

mobile with good ground communications. Areas of special

activity such as supply depots, are usually surrounded

by prepared defenses with tanks, troops, trenches,

and automatic weapon (AW) positions. The Aw positions

normally are unoccupied; however, mobile amounts

of quads, ete., could be moved into these

positions on short notice. Areas of heavy military activ-

ity and airfields are usually further protected by AA

weapons up to 57 mm. Larger numbers of .30 and .50

calibre machine guns are included in AA and ground

defense installations. Ground forces are well equipped

with mortars, AT guns, assault guns,

tanks, submachine

guns and rifles.

b. Characteristics of the Area of Operations

(1) Transportation

(a).

There

are over

5, 000 miles of all weather

roads in Cuba, some 3,500 miles of which are paved.

SPECIAL HANDLING

An additional 3,200 miles of road are passable in the

dry season. The most important artery of communication

and chief connecting link between Cuba's major cities

is the Central Highway. Over 700 miles long, it

runs between Pinar del Rio and Santiago de Cuba

following the central axis of the island except

where it turns

north of Havana and Matanzas and south

to Bayamo and

Santiago de Cuba. From the Central Highway,

a road and highway network extends curward toward the

coast, and

ranges from farm roads, at timesunusable,

to all weather highways connecting important coastal

areas. The mountainous area

east of Santigao de Cuba

is completely unserviced by cads or railroads,

and

air or sea transportation is the only reliable means of

reaching some eastern tip areas such as Baracoa.

(b) Total railroad trackage in Cuba is over 11, 000

miles. The rail network closely parallels the

highway network along the central island axis with

connecting lines to all areas of commercial

Importance. Basically, Cuba's railroads are in

mupport of the sugar industry and their financial

stability and operative effectiveness have fluctuated

with this industry. Castro has probably seen to it

that both rail and highway systems have been brought

up to

a higher level of effectiveness than in the

pre-revolutionary days.

Assuming that the rail and

highway systems are in good repair, rapid deployment

of ground forces to any part of the island

is

distinct capability. This deployment will be further

enhanced by the three (3) self-sufficient territorial

commands designated as the Armies of the west, the

Central and the East. Each

of these Armies has full

operational control of all regular and ready reserve

units in its area.

(c) Cuba has good facilities throughout the island

for air transportation. Approximately 95 airfields

in various stages of usability from highly efricient

International airports with 10, 000 feel (plus)

runways to 2,500 feet landing strips of sod, dot the

countryside. Over 45 transport/cargo type aircraft

are presently in

service with

additional Soviet

made CRATE aircraft being procured.

(a) A negligible coastal

trade is in effect in

Cuba which in some instances

uses

sailing vessels for

cargo carriers. There are a number of excellent

ports with modern facilities for international trade.

The main ports are Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Cienfuegos,

and Nuevitas.

(2) Telecommunications

(a) The entire island of Cuba is criss-crossed with

a complete network of communications including landline,

manual and automatic telegraph, teleprinter, both

UHF and VHF voice links, and facsimile circuits. All

communications are controlled by the Ministry of

Cormunications and communications systems are available

for use by the milltary as required. Complete portions

of the present communications systems

were installed

by RCA and Philco Corporations and are considered

to

be very reliable. Along with tele-communications

systems, the island is covered with an extensive

network of radio and IV stations. Nearly all areas,.

no matter how remote, may be recipients of regularly

broadcast radio and IV programs. The US embargo and

the lack of adequate telecon equipment producing

industry in Cuba together with an acute shortage of

engineers severely limits maintenance or expansion of

the present system. However,

some development programs

are in progress and equipment for these programs 1s

being

obtained from Hungary, Switzerland and the

Soviet Bloc.

(3) Political

(a) The present regime in Cuba is in the process

of reorganizing the government into a totalitarian

political system.

The traditional provincial and munici

pal governments are being replaced by Juntas for

Coordination, Execution and Inspection (JUCEI).

Already established in each province of Cuba, the

JUCEI consists of a Provincial Congress, representative

of all major economical entities in the territory

which meets occasionally, the "plenum" of the Congress

which meets every few months, and several smaller

bodies which meet frequently and actually direct the

provincial administration. The new totalitarian

political machine is to be called the United Party of

the Cuban

Socialist Revolution, a merger of the amorphous

20 of July Movement with the well organized Communist

party. Although Castro, is, of course, to be the

supreme head of this party, the man who

is pushing

the project is Blas Roca,

the Secretary General of the

Communist party. Party membership is to be limited

to the elite of the revolutionary struggle and will

be prerequisite for appointment to any Important

political or economic position. The new organization

will enhance the already extensive communist control

of Cuban Institutions and the influence of Blas

Roca on policy.

(b) An important arm of the Castro political

organization is the Association of Rebel Youth (AJR).

It now numbers some 150,000 members.

Many of these

teenagers are of the type which elsewhere is found

In juvenile gangs. Recognition and status accorded them

by the regime

makes them fanatical in its service.

Active

participation

in the

AJR

is becoming requisite

for educational

advancement

and eventual political

preferment.

, (4) Economics

(a) The Cuban economy is now feeling the impact of

three revolutionary changes: (1) the loss of experienced

middle and upper level managerial and technical

talent, (2) imposition of elaborate state control,

and (3) a drastic shift in the trading pattern from

primary dependence on the US to primary dependence on

the soviet Bloc.

The elimination of the US quota for

Cuban sugar has deprived Cuba of its major source of

dollar income.

US embargo has also produced

economic

difficulties especially through the denial of spare

parts for previously acquired US equipment. Although

Cuba's free world trade has declined sharply, and

foreign exchange reserves have been

exhausted, the

Bloc is taking enough exports

and

returning

enough goods

and machinery to keep the economy going.

In addition,

to trade, the Soviet Bloc has extended to Cuba 357

million dollars in credits for industrial development.

(b) In general, the Cuban economy is now

characterized by major shortages and considerable

disorganization. However, in view of the availabillty

of Bloc assistance, It is not believed that the

economy will deteriorate so far as to bring about

Castro's over-throw or to force him to make basic

changes in his policy.

c. Cuban Military Situation.

(1) Strength

The Cuban ground forces are in the process of

thorough reorganization designed to enhance their effect-

Iveness. The numerical strength of the Army has declined

as Army personnel

are absorbed into the militia as

cadres. At the same time there has developed within the

militia differentiation between

various categories of

units.

Thus, meaningful distinction is no longer

that between the Army and the militia, but rather

that between the regular ready reserve and home guard

type units. On this basis the ground forces available

to the regime to suppress insurrection or revel

Invasion are estimated to be:

Regular Forces - 75,000 (Army, Navy, Air

active duty

militia)

Ready Reserve - 100,000

Home Guard - 100,000

(c) Navy

The Cuban Navy is capable of moderately effective

patrol operations along selected

portions of the Cuban

coast.

But its combat capabilities are negligible.

Mutinies, defections, and purges have left it few

professionally trained

and technically qualified

men.

Its present personnel strength

is composed largely of new

recruits and

militiamen and is estimated at not more

than 4,000. Defections among Navy personnel have been

so high

that active duty militia personnel are assigned

to units as security against further defections.

(2) Uniforms and Insignia

(a) The uniform of the cuban Army closely resembles

that of the US Army's olive green, cotton, field

uniform - although many combinations and variations

exist. The lack of uniformity in dress may be

attributed to a lack of discipline, which within

certain limits permits many combinations of what is,

in reality, a simple and practical field uniform.

(b) The majority of militiamen possess uniforms

which they have provided themselves. The uniform of the

Farmer's Militia is a straw

hat, blue work shirt,

and

olive green trousers. The uniform of

the Students'

Militia consists of a black beret, maroon shirt,

and gray trousers.

(3) MobIlity

The Cuban forces are estimated to have the

capability of reasonably good mobility for all active

duty units. This mobility is enhanced by the

acquisition of some 5, 000 pieces of military

transportation including US and Soviet made 4x4 and

6x6 truck and tractor-trailer type units. (See

paragroph 2b(1), Transportation).

by the recent reorganization dividing the island

operationally into three self-sustaining Army areas of

command.

Operational control of all forces within the

East, Central and Western Army areas is vested in the

commander of the particular area.

(4) Availability of Reinforcements

The Peoples' Militia both male and female, with a

potential strength of 500,000 spends several hours a

week in training under the tutorship of the active

duty forces. This militia is well equipped with

Communist Bloc produced small arms, plentiful

supples of ammunition, and constitute

an avilable

source of reinforcements to add depth to the active

forces.

No outside source of reinforcements is known

to be available.

(5) Serviceability and Operational Rates of Aircraft

(a) In the event that Cuba elects to act against

an exercise force,

the Cuban Rebel Air Force in an

all-out effort could probably launch about 25 high

performance jet aircraft. Conventional aircraft

possessed would probably be held in reserve to

repel

ground

and landing forces. Due to the early

stages of training, probable early stages of

organization and poor terminal facilities, the

reattack capability of the CRAF jet fighters 1s

considered to be relatively low.

(b) There is evidence to indicate that I-33 and

other American type aircraft may display US military

markings. The problem of turn around is complicated

by the fact that parts and supplies for British and

American type aircraft have been cut off. A pressure

refueling capability is not indicated at any Cuban

base supporting jet type aircraft.

During combat

operations MIG

aircraft: which normally fly from three

Cuban fields could be expected to deploy to other

more remote airfields.

c. Unconventional and Psychological Warfare Situation

(1) Guerrilla

Some guerrilla activity against the Castro forces

can be expected by widely dispersed bands of anti-

Castro groups operating from mountainous areas of the

island. Due to the small size of the bands and lack

of coordinated leadership, it is doubtful that they

can do more than harrass the active forces cy

occasional cutting of lines of communications.

(2) Psychological

At the first indication of US operations oriented

toward the area

of Cuba, the Cuban Government is

expected to charge the US with hostile intentions.

Charges

will

undoubtedly be placed before the UN and

the OAS, and to the world public through all

propaganda media. In addition, it is expected that

Cuba, through her representatives and/or agents in all

South American countries, will try to bring pressure

to bear to cause Latin American governments to

condemn the action of the US Government.

(3) Sabotage

Sporadic cases of sabotage may be carried out by

anti-Castro groups against the communications

systems.

However, they will probably be on such a

small scale as to be an annoyance rather than a

handicap to the Cuban Government.
