Case 49364 - Possible ‘Involvement of
George Brown in Garrison’ Matter

Haynes/Musulin Telecon $ Jan 68

1, In connection with referenced telecon and in anticipation of
receipt of memo on this request from Musulin, Haynes contacted
Herbert Frensley and learned that he would only-be available early in
the morning of 8 January as he was leaving town for several days at
mid-morning. Feeling that he was fairly well informed oa what Musulin
would request in his memo, Haynes made arrangements to see Frensley
before he left town, : Z

2, Frensley stated that there have been no further developments
in the Gurevich approach (thtough the Newsweck correspondent) to Brown,
Frens!ey had advised Brown to ignore the matter and thus far he has,
Frensley says’ that Brown has not the slightest intention of trying to
gain access to the documents referred to by the Newsweex correspondent.

3, Frensley was most appreciative of the small amvunt of back-
ground we could furnish him on Gurevich and his methods, We will keep
you informed {f there are further developments.
