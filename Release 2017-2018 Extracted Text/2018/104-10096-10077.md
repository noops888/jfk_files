As you can see, haste often

makes for much waste!!

After No. 16, things begin

to get a bit confused as you

can clearly see. I have no

way of knowing what is what.

Therefore, I have made two

versions -- both of them are

probably incorrect -- but

I had no other choice.

Anyway, after Paragraph 16,

everything seems to be a

mess.

Also note the spelling of

Alvarado is two different

ways -- 1 just picked one

and did it the same way

twice. I don't know which

is correct.

was omitted from the transcript, and the CIA

claimed it did not know of most of Oswald's

activities in Mexico City until after the

assassination.

16. COMMENT:

"CIA claimed it did not know of most of

OSWALD's activities in Mexico City until after the assassination."

This is true; however, it should be pointed out that after the

dissemination on 10 October of the 1 October 1963 contact no re-

quests were received from the recipients of the report for further

information or follow-up investigation. Under the Delimitations

Agreement, OSWALD, as a former Marine, was a Navy and FBI case

and potentially of interest to the Department of State.

In interviews with The Post, Belin, who docu

mented the CIA plots against Castro in his capacity

as executive director of the Rockefeller commission,

revealed the CIA also did not tell the Warren Com-

mission of a report from an alleged witness to a

meeting in Mexico City between Oswald and Cuban

intelligence agents.

for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 1 June 1964, from Richard HELMS, Deputy

Director for Plans.

(See also Memorandum for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 4 June

1964, from Richard HELMS; subject: Information Developed on the

Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City.

This memorandum

became Commission Exhibit No. 3152 contained in Volume saVI of

Warren Commission report.)

Belin called on the CIA to make full disclosure

of its knowledge of Oswald and his contacts with the

Cubans

and Russians.

No real recollection of who might have gone over Win Scptt's

records after he died in 1970. Ijink it was someone from CI.

Bgo shaw recalls the following names of possible sources:

Anne Goodpaster (Scott's secretary) now retired to Texas

she carried the tapes back and forth.

Charlotte Zarino Bustos (now Videla), currentzy on home leave

from

¿lan White vas DCOS lexico during some of this time. Now retired.

Tex Puckett,

personally close to scott, but left April bay 1963.

How retired.

Joe Loftus phoned back from In to name

as a possible, but

he was COS (according to someone in background) 1913-75.

Russ Holmes phoned to say that he found the pseudo of a Douglas d. FEINGLAS

speaking on the atrocious Ru sian of the man who had identified himself as

Lee Oswald. I asked Joe Loftus if he can identify that man's true name.
