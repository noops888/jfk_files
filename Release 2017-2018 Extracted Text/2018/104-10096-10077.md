As you can see, haste often
makes for much waste! !

After No. 16, things begin
to get a bit confused as you
can clearly see. I have no
way of knowing what is what.
Therefore, I have made two
versions -- both of them are
probably incorrect -- but

I had no other choice.

Anyway, after Paragraph 16,
everything seems to be a
mess.

hj

Also note the spelling of
Alvarado is two different
ways -- I just picked one
and did it the same way
twice. I don't know which
is correct.



was omitted from the transcript, and the CIA
claimed it did not know of most of Oswald's
activities in Mexico City until after the
assassination.

16. COMMENT: "CIA claimed it did not know of most of
OSWALD's activities in Mexico City until after the assassination."
This is true; however, it should be pointed out that after the
dissemination on 10 October of the 1 October 1963 contact no re-
quests were received from the recipients of the report for further
information or follow-up investigation. Under the Delimitations
Agreement, OSWALD, as a former Marine, was a Navy and FBI case
and potentially of interest to the Department of State.

In interviews with The Post, Belin, who docu-
mented the CIA plots against Castro in his capacity
as executive director of the Rockefeller commission,
revealed the CIA also did not tell the Warren Com-
mission of a report from an alleged witness to a
meeting in Mexico City between Oswald and Cuban
intelligence agents.

17. COMMENT: Is BELIN referring to Gilberto ALVARADO
Urgate? If so, information regarding OSWALD provided by ALVARADO
was passed to the Warren Commission as attachments to a memorandum
for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 1 June 1964, from Richard HELMS, Deputy
Director for Plans.

(See also Memorandum for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 4 June
1964, from Richard HELMS; subject: Information Developed on the
Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City. This memorandum
became Commission Exhibit No. 3152 contained in Volume XXVI of
Warren Commission report.)

Belin called on the CIA to make full disclosure
of its knowledge of Oswald and his contacts with the
Cubans and Russians.
