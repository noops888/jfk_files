Notes on Contacts

The undersigned arrived in parts on the morning of the 25th of March and went: to

the safehouse where the LeFLUTTER operster had spent the fight and was shortly

to meet subject at the cafe tes Sport pear the Por- Matilot. Subject passed by

as ve were having coffee and according to instructions walted elsewhere.

We

left while the operator collected Subiies and tock htm to the house, enabling us

to return at about 12 hours.

Subject was dismissed for lunch at about 1145, whereupon the operator and

the undersigned returned to the Embassy office where after a quick lunch the

questions for the examination vere written. The operator met Subject, returned.

to the house, and began the examination at about 1430, it having been agreed

we would appear at the safehouse promptly at 1630. He did this to find that the

operator had not concluded the examination but there was sufficient time to.

continue which he did.

The examination was completed about 1845 hours, whereupon

ve were Informed by the operatcr that in his opinion Subject was not attempting

to decelve on any important points, even

though sone of the more prosate aspects

of his blography continue to defy logical acceptance.

we then discussed future meeting arrangements with Subject:

Subject will

appear in front of the Cafe Georges V on the Champs Elysees at 1214 and 16 hours

on 6 April: He will wait for five minutes in front of the cafe but will bọt:

enter.

If we are not there he will return for the alternate. In any event

alternate contact will be made through Annick. Subject was instructed to clear

up his affairs in Ambert and be prepared to depart for Germany; however, It wäs

also explained to Subject that we were not authorized to make a final commitment

to subject and that much as we regretted this, this would be left until 6 April.

Subject was paid Francs 15,500 for which no receip; was obtained since we were

in a hurry to catch a plane for the Hague. If Subject has any difficulties he

will write Annick. He will not return to Gap.

He expects to stay with Josef

Dassaud in Ambert until the night of 5 April when he will travel to Paris by

train.

It was further agreed that on or about 4 or 5 April Subject will have

sent a letter to Annickfor "Mike" In which he will conform his arrival and in

double talk inform us if he has had any trouble.

he discussed with Platipodis of the Paris station the need to send "Maurice"

to Annick on 4 or 5 April to see if Subject had written.

Upon the receipt of DIR

the undersigned borrowed a car

was Informed that we would arrive. at Ambert at about 12 o'clock, and we agreed to

However, Subject.gets.ne Income other

than pocket money, free room and board where he now lives, and will not receive

any until the capital outlay of his other two partners has been amortized.

Taking

the bull-by the horris we explained to Subject the delay: A telegram had been sent

to "certain colleagues" in Paris. who were supposed to write a letter to be for

warded to Subject.,

The man to whom the telegram was sent was

on leave and upon

return he' was not notified of the telegram we sent; consequently, Subject was not

inforwed as he should have been.

We are terribly sorry and hope that Subject

would

appreciate such a minor matter. "In any event we reminded Subject that he had not

een promised a letter on or about 1 February

but rather sold that he could expect

I hear from us then.

Subject agreed this was so.

Subject was far less interested in explanation than a decision.

He rhetorically

asked

whether he was acceptable, adcing he was

obliged to assume he ras not, and

commer.ting

that although there are "rany two legged people in America also" he

thought he was probably a unique persom from the point of view of language ability,

experience as an operator in dangerous situations,. etc.

We replied this:

One man

(the psychologist) has already come all the way from the States just to see Subject

and another was on his way.

From this Subject

could fairly conclude the importance

"Headquarters"

attaches to Subject's candidature and that far from being a dead

Issue, Subject's prospects were good, although all depended or him.

We then turned to the matter of Subject coming

to Paris.

Subject explained

that Paul (

) had been sent by the paris station

to Annick and had not done very

well.

He had failed to convince Annick that he was

sent by like (Friganza) and

apparently although we did not go inic the details of

this, he did

nct get the message

straight.. In any case Subject immediately said

that he could

come

to paris anytime although he would be abliged to travel

1llcgally•

This

because he had permitted his identity document to expire as of 14

February 1959.

subject leil he could make the journey by train without

being caught because

the police are not checking most trains.

He did not want to

travel by car because. he

had heard there are occasional road blocks (this may be

true for the undersigned ran into one on the

drive from Paris to Ambert).

sübject

also said he

could stay as long as

need by but it was absolutely essential "that he

not be obliged to stay at a hotel -- he could either stay with Annick or at a place

pat at his disposal by

concept of nobility has evolved into a concept of dignity and pride in his

work.

The family left Georgia when the Subject was three... They fled

before the soviet invasion. Subject feels that his real exietence began

at this point.

Because the father had provided himself with certain montes,

the family was able to live comfortably and even opulently. However, the

vicissitudes of life brought the famlly progressively to material degradation

and financial difficultles which greatly influenced subject's way of think-

ing thereafter.

Whereas the family had previously lived in an artificial

feudalistic way, life became tough. Subject feels that the family was

brought into more direct contact with reality and that this was not

necessarily a bad influence.

6. Subject actually did not want to leave Ceorgia. He felt it was

a flight rather than a tactical retreat. Apparently he has never been

able to accept this humiliating defeat and it may be that part of his

current motivation for affiliation involves his perception of an opportunity

to take countermeasures against the soviets.

He is a person who cannot

tolerate being beaten in competition.

in the form of aggressive and destructive behaviour. Apparently Subject

was a precocious child and he experienced disillusionment in his family

and In society. It is as if he suddently discovered to his great dis-

appointment that there was no Santa Claus.

8. At first Subject felt his disillustonment was unique and pecullar

to his particular life experience, but he soon discovered that his dis-

content was characteristic of others. He experienced this fighting

attitude within himself and he reflected it in his non-conforming. be-

9. His mother reacted to his behaviour with over affectionate

solicitousness.

She wasn't actually able to determine the reasons for his

Internal distress;

but she was aware something was taking place within him.

The mother was apparently a marked conformist who insisted that subject

abide by the sccial order. She tok him to a psychiatrist because of his

behaviour problems and because she did not advise him of what she was

doing and got him to a psychiatrist on a subterfuge, and because Subject

did not agree with the psychlatrist's conclusions, he did not benefit

by this experience.

He feels that many people need help

and he has always wanted to help others in order to help himself. In other

words he is motivated to helping others in order to obtain love and

affection. This need for love and affection is probably the most primary

of his notives.

Il. In respect to the flight of the family fron Georgia, Subject feels

he was too young to understand it. However, he feels he revolted against

1t. His idea is that one must fight, surpass and conquer.. As a young boy

he felt he was much stronger than several million men. This is extremely

important as regards utilization of his services. First of all he is

motivated to succeed out of a spirit of revenge, and secondly he 1s self-

confidant and optimistic that he will succeed despite the hazards of the

undertaking. He is like a man who wants to kill an elephant - all he

wants from us is a high-powered rifle - then he feels he would be equal

to the elephant.

12:

Subject also seems to reflect disappointment in his fathér as

a personal ideal. He regards his father as a very independent person,

kind but profoundly selfish, bt who would nevertheless give you the

shirt off his back. His father was fond of the children, loved the whole

family and was happy when he saw others happy. However, Subject is con-

vinced that if his father had succeeded, none of the things that. happened

In his life would have come to pass. He feels that his motner's sulaide

1s a direct consequence of his father's

failure to succeed.

13.

When his father and sister returned to Georgia, Subject was driven

to despair by the breaking-up of the family. The death of his mother and

the departure of his father and sister was quite a threat to his security.

15. Subject's sister followed her father to Georgia out of a spirit

of affection and sacrifice.

She felt that her father needed her and

Subject feels she was a tributary of his mistakes. The sister has a Ph.D.

In languages and taught courses in school. At the time of Stalin the

children would say. "we have done this and that thanks to Stalin" and she

would reply "you are individuals and you have done this or that without

Stalin." As & result she was arrested and sent to a concentration camp.

With the change of regimes she obtained her freedom and got her Job back.

18. Subject was the baby of the family and still 1s. Whereas he

ras born in 1918, his brother was born in 1916 and his sister in 1915.

Subject was more expressive of affection, particularly for his mother,

whereas his brother was more timid, shy, and independent. When the

brother saw Subject getting the mother's attention, he tried to replace

Subject, This sibling rivalry may continue to date, for example, the

brother learned that subject was seeing a girl whom he knew. The brother

advised the girl to leave Subject alone.

19.

Subject denies he is Jealous of his brother. He admits his

brother has been successful but in his own sphere. Subject's new found

philosophy is not to accept the fact that he has been unsuccessful, but

to try to explain why he has not. In other words he seems to be motivated

to obtain greater knowledge of himself:

Subject does not consider himself as a Georgian; this is of no

child but the most important aspect is that he feels he was

defeated by the necessity of the family's flight from Georgia... He offers

as an analogy the fact that he was committed to prison; this was a defeat

for him. In other words he was not bothered by the prison life but by the

fact that he made a wrong calculation in taking on a bad associate and con-

Ho reals he must cleo have been impressed by their patriotiate foote

a tare and enthralling manner which exalted

and deeply impressed him.. He feels this particular association may account

for his passion which he always puts in the execution of whatever ke

undertakes. One of the principal determinants of this man's behaviour

is apparently the very strong desire to sueceed and accomplish.

22. subject feels that throughout his school experience perhaps only

one or two professors understood him. These particular professors thought

that it was often necessary in life to "swallow" a great deal of useless

"stuff" so that thereafter certain essential problems could be more easily

digested. Subject feels that these professors were superior and that he

understood them, whereas he regarded the others as apparently idiotic

or worthless.

23. Subject was influenced by heroes whom he heard about such as

Lindbergh, Edison, Hitler, Einstein, and several others. He realized that

If such people existed, it meant that the possibility to act either for

good or for evil also existed. He did not identify with any one hero in

particular but always wished that he could have been one of them. He did

not actually want to be one of them, but wanted to resemble heroes in

general.. Subject always peratno- remembers certain great men mentioned

in history. He feels that these great men gave him the concept that a

certain order was necessary for the level of the people. However, 1t

appears he was disillusioned in these men and his ideals were shaken be-

cause he later learned to his dismay that they could count abject or

monstrous acts.

Subject feels he has made many mistakes in life but how-

ever big these mistakes may be, he does not feel they have reflected his

basic character.. He feels that his character was basically based by the

desire to become a worthwhile individual, even at the cost of behaving

wrongly. He feels that if the only criterion for judging a man to his:

and all his illusions disappeared. He tried to find affection through

others. He feels the need for affection is a big part of himself but

on the other hand "I am a complicated person."

26. Subject claims he has leärned the difference between a man and

a woman. This 1s likely to have a good deal of meaning to him, particularly.

as regards his relationship with hia mother.. He regards women as allogical

and to be determined by a psycho-feminine education. This is enough to

tip us off that he should not be exposed to handling by females.

27. Subject claims he has learned from his personal experience in

life rather than from the experience of others. In other words he has

educated himself in the school of life and has derived little from the

aotual formal school situation. For example, he claims his mothers

opinions had importance only at the time she was rendering her opinions;

thereafter they were not influential as far as he was concerned. This

may be important as

regards training. It Is likely that he would prefer

to proceed with the task in actuality rather than to learn about per-

forming the task through the experiences or training of others.

necessery to build a family and to make a hone. He feels his marriage was

a mistake because, even though he understands the value of the principles

involved, principles which were inculoated by his father, It' is ridiculous

to marry just for the sake of principles without the necessary sentiments..

He feels that at the time he was merely abiding by precepts of his father

without thinking of the possible consequences. However he soon discovered,

In fact, a family did not represent anything at all, and that creating the

view point getting marrled meant building a wall around himself. It also

meant that instead of finding a partner who complemented him, all that he

obtained from the partnership was a

reflection of himself.

He feels that the so-called spiritual intimacy is a fallacy. He claims

that, sexually speaking, women are necessary but he fails to say why it

•is necessary to build a separate world with it.

31. During the war when Subject was in Cermany, he göt involved in

a false documents business and created a gang which he led. The purpose

of the group was to repatriate or liberate war prisoners. The black

market was a worthless branch, technically speaking. of the orgenization.

Its only purpose was to solve financial problems. However, It 18 true that

the black market reached such a magnitude that a person who was interested

only in making money would have found it quite satisfying and sufficient

in Itself.

As a whole, the technical efficiency of his gang satisfied

him. They had freedom of notion and security. Subject was arrested be-

cause of a carelessness or a slip, not in the actual functioning.of the

gang, but rather on the part of one of the men whom they were helping.

32. Through this experience Subject learned that it was very inter-

esting to know the weaknesses of authoritles and to play these weaknesses

or. forces against one another. His emotions corresponded to a joy of

being the sole master of his actions and moves. He feels that if he were

to find himself in this sort of situation again, he would act in exactly.

the same way.

33. When subject was arrested by the Gestapo, he was considered by

the Germans to be a very important preg. He played the game and led the

Germans to believe

that he was an important prey in the hope that such

belief woüld give him certain advantages..

35. Subject attacked a bank in 1950. At the time he wes marrled and

was the father of one child. He was working in a model makers ahop and

although he was not well off, he was earning a decent living. Hoever,

because of his love

for risk and out of friendship for another fellow, he

agreed to participate in the bank attack. Apparently the other fellow

trusted subject because he knew of Subject's war activities and he figured

that because Subject had been able to acoomplish certain illegal activities

that he was quite capable of attacking a bank.. The attack was carefully

planned. Because there were only two on the team they were compelled in

view of the smallness

if his staff to give extra sitention to their plan.

36. According to subject he was close to this young ftlend who.

solicited his financial assistance. At first, Subject felt that the other

fellow was crazy to dare to attack a bank. He also had the normal twinge

of conselence and asked himself the question "is It right to do harm by

robbing a bank?" Subject never felt that the two alone would be able to

attack the bank successfully. Consequently, they determined to knock

over a Jewelry shop first. At each point in the developmenta Subject

wanted to withdraw from the whole deal by saying "if my mother learned of

this, she would die." They postponed the job indefinitely, However, hla

mother died in the meantive and his friend again approached him and told

him that now that his mother was dead, there was no longer such a danger.

Subsequently they knocked over the jewelry store.

Subject's chief notivation for such an actlvity appears to be

the following: (a) friendship. Apparently Subject will do anything for

a friend.

(b) Action.

However, the friend returned after having spent his money.

Prevlously Subject had told him "you got your money for the marrlage;

now leave me alone."

However, the friend had not married and was now

des: rous of robbing a bank in order to finance another Intended marriage.

subject agreed that this would be the last Job. They cased the Joint very

carefully and then committed the act.

The other fellow apparently threw

his money around, was arrested, and squealed. The police came to

had learned that his bank deal partner had been arrested and had talked,

and had to flee.

He had not foreseen or prepared himself fur such a con-

sequence. If he were to find himself again In the same situation, he would

prepare an escape even if it were only necessary for the satisfactory

planning of the project.

39. However, the question which arises in this examiner's mind 1s

why Subject panicked in his flight. It could have been that he un.

consciously wanted. to.get caught and to be punished in order.

to relieve

his guilt. If this 19 so, then important consideration should be given

to this aspect of Subject's personality as regards planning the project.

and also then he was arrested by the Prench. He feela these to ratured

feele it is now up to his to take all une necessary precautions la order

entire world seemed to conspire against him and when everything seemed to

collapse before him, yet he has always felt there were ways to get ouf of

unless a man is so weak both physically and morally, it 1s always possible

for him to get back on his feet or at least so hope that this 18 possible.

Consequently, even when he was. broke,. Subject always believed there was a

posalbility to fight and conquer. It Is likely he will always have hope

and optimism.

13.

Ag. regards his philosophy on the two projects which involved

liberating French prisoners and the bank attack, he was betrayed by

another. Actually, however, he could not have become angry at these

persons because he felt his betrayal was unimportant. However, these

persons lost his esteen because he feels there are certain moral values

which he holds dearly, namely friendship. This would indicate that he is

pore in contempt of himself for having miscalculated than angry with the

other person for having betrayed him. However, Subject does not feel that

any of his mistakes, regardless of their size and consequence, have serioug

consequences as regards his near or distant future. There is no question

that his mistakes have seriously reduced his circumstances of life, but he

Although SubJect has seen many things in hits life and has had

many opportunitres to becone angry, he feels he has never coopletely lost

self control. He feels he has always been the master of his actions at

all times and that these actions could haye been changed by his own volitian.

45 It subject has ever been ashamed of himself, It must have been

when his behavlour was wrongly interpreted by persons whom he loved or who

loved him.

In other words, too large a dose of affection w1ll unsest Subject despite

the fact that he cont nualty colloits affection.

47. Subject has continually deceived and disappointed his mother

because overy time She started hlm in a new school, she made him pronise

he would behave nicely, but each time he was thrown out of school. He 1s

convinced she wanted this for his good and not for the satisfaction of

having a perfect child. However, it is likely that the mother's over-

gOlleltousness was actually compensatory for her basic rejection of

subject. Therefore, she wanted him to be perfect so that she could love

him. consequently, It is ikely that she did things for him, but she did

things with him for herself. In other

words, she wanted him to be perfect

so that he could be worthy

of her love. He was not perfect, probably did

not obtain her love, and consequently is continually seeking the love of

other persons. However, he cannot accept this fact as regards his mother

and dentes she did not act in his interest. One of his chief defenses la

denial; that 1s, simply assuming the attitude that such and such was not

true when he probably believes it was true.

48.

Subject's actions are often impulsive and unreasoned. such

fact that there may be no particular tle or affection between him and the

other person. Subject is unable to explain why this 19 so and intellectual

In other words, this

53.

subject feela that a critio yould say of nia chat the majority

of his comercial undertakings have brought results which are considerabl

lover than noped for consequently, he feels he is elither an optimist

or a joker, or else hts views on the possibilities of accomplishing

things are not very healthy

540

In his defense he emphasizes that in blo optaton the value of an

achlevement does not constst of lis spectacular magnitude or in its

multiplietty.

for example, he reele it a not necessary to say 1eood

morning" 100 times in order to understand the meaning and purpose of

"good morning." Also he does not feel it is necessary to mass produce

a machine in order to fully understand its function. However, he realizes

that, comercially speaking, It Is more rational to mass produce the

machine but the repitition does not Interest him. In his opinion the

creative ider and

the prototype have a much greater value and Importance

than the setting up of the factory which will popularize the prototype.

To illustrate his feeling further he Is of the opinion that one single

thought from a great thinker appears to him to be much more valuable

than the millions of books which are published yearly.

55. In describing himself Subject reveals that he always tries his

hardest to keep his promises.

He also feels that be sometimes appears to

talk somewhat rashly but he feels this is due to the fact that he thinks

fast and he is able to seg quickly the components and the essence of a

problem in its various prospectives. He is able to rapidly synthesize.

In other words he learns extremely fast and he sets the point Immediately

He is so quick that he will understand what you are. trying to say before

you finish the sentence.

56. Subject is unable to see himself in terms of what he would like

to be.

In order for him to display himself, It would be necessary that he

would be another person altegether. However, he feels that, everything

relative, perhaps he should show more"strength of character, be a little

more compromising, more realistic, and less sentimental. However, this

would imply that he would then find himself in an environment in which

there was no room for sentiment - in which case his personality would

out of place.

57: It Is Subject's expertence that his friends love him for what

he is. He likes his triends as they are, probably because they are as

they are. The ides of attemptins to change a friend is unthinkable for

nim. He loves them for their bad pointe as well as their good points:

58. Subject to an optimist but also a pessimista

He feels he will

never be able to reach its Ideals because his matertal ideal (soctal

reform) Is so distant that he would need to lead many

order to attath it.

To might be unfatr co call this man a pessimiet:

It is nore likely he is a realist and perhaps a cynic.

59. This man denies that he has any interest or emotional

attachment to Prance at this time. However, it is likely he was patriotio

at the time of the war.. Since he has been branded a criminal and has

been deprived of certain rights and privileges, he now perhaps feels re-

Jected and in turn is rejecting France as his fatherland. Nevertheless,

he strikes the examiner as a true Frenchnan - he thinks and feels like a

Frenchman and is certainly not a Russian in his personality. It is likely

that he Identifles the French authorities with the police.

He cannot

tolerate rejecting attitudes. He is like an outsider who is looing in.

It may be he has the "sour grapes" attitude by wnich he feels that since

he cannot have what he wants, it is not too good anyway.

60. Subject Is not a planner. Despite his Interest in invention

and the fact that he has pulled off a number of capers, he is more of an

Inselgator, a lender, and an executor. In order for him to be successful

In future projects, it is necessary. that someone else plan and then tell

him exactly what to do.

61. Subject is currently Involved in the invention business which

he started alone. He is the owner and exploiter of several patents and

certain persons are financially and technically interested In his in-

ventions:

He is faced with a problem at this time. He is Involved in

the initial and preliminary phases with us and

consequently. is put on

the fence as regards his invention business,

Furthermore, if he were to

Join us, he would relinquish

everything to his business partners.

62. this person will open himself up readily to an open personality.

He will be secretive with an inhibited or secretive personality. Con-

sequently, the best person to work with this individual is a direct,

expressive and visible personality:

provement of ilving conditions for everybody: In other words he la a

human tarian He ls not necessartly an activistie social reformer.

subject, expresseS himself freely, is discursive, volubles and

1a able to carry on a conversation Indefinitely. This la typically Prench

but, in particular, it representa an oral characteristic. In other words.

he 1a all south. He both expresses himself orally and he is driven by

desire to obtain oral supplies by incorporation. What this means is that

he will eat you up.

65. Subject reflects: superior intelligence, Is capable of abstract

conceptualization, and is able to deal in symbols.

66. subject is a narcisaistie character who feels that because others

don't love him, he needs to love himself.. In other words, he 1s quite in

love with himself and acts accordingly.

67. Subject tends to rationalize and to offer socially acceptable

reasons

for his individualistic behavior.

68. Subject strives chiefly for emotional satisfaction.

69. Subject is An altrüistic but at the same time he is selfish. He

will do things for the community with the hope of getting something out of

It for himself, Both of these drives merge in a unitary fashion.".

He Is

motivated by both at the same time.

70.

subject dentes nationalistic motives for his actions and prefers

to regard them as being primarily humanitarian. .

Subject is action-oriented

and loves to take risk and gets a kick out of excitement and adventure.

## Page 33

71. subject acts because he thinks he Is right.

72. Subject acts because he thinks he will succeed and because he

regarda what he undertakes as important. He is egotistical in this regard.

73. Subject needs co prove to others that he la successtul. He 18

self confident in his provess but la Insecure that others may not regar

him as adequate as he feels he 1s.

74. It ls Interesting to note that Subject participated in the

release of the 13 Prench prisoners not out of patriotle motives, but to

satisty his taste for action. it they vere German prisoners, he

would

have done the same thing.

Actually, Subject admired the German army, had

sympathy for Germans, but did not wish the French to be hared, This le

quite paradoxical but understandable in terns of the subject's personality.

His emotionalized ideals are not defined in terms of politice or

nationalities, but 'are determined by a vague desire to help others who

need it. This combination can mislead him and get him into difficulty;

for example, his accomplice in the bank robbery.

75. Subject Is a rank individualist. He 1s a non-conformist.

However, he realizes he must cope with the community, must sacrifice for

the

of the community, and must not harm others. In this

regard 1t is unlikely that Subject has ever committed physical assault,

nor 1s It likely that he would in the future.. No matter what the other

person is or represents to Subject, he is still a human being whom

Subject respects.

76. Although Subject is basically an exhibitionist, he is not

Inclined to bragging or to exhiblt himself in a transparent or patent

fashion. He is too sophisticated. However, he necds attention and 1s

likely to do things in order to get attention. This is what he did in

18 schools.

77. As was previously mentloned, Subject helped French prisoners

get back to France during the war.

He thought it

was the right thing to

do but did not do it just for france.. He was pald for it but he gave

his money to help the prisoners. In terms of his hierarchy of motlves,

It is likely that this person acts according to what he considers to be

right.

Re also expresses

self pride in doing the outstanding, the difficult,

---

## Page 34

119/

and for which he is not necessarily being pald. He acts out of principle,

with no spectal reason

He helped the Prench prisoners despite the fait

that he had sympathy for the Germans. However, hid sympathy for the

Germans way based on the fact that some Georgians had relatives in Germany

and he preferred that the Germans would defeat the fussians.

78. Another reason he helped the French prisoners was that no folt

that they vere suffering and because they vere suffering, he wanted to

relieve then by helping them return to their country mus he was bent

on nurturance:

he always stands ready to help someone tho so in need.

79. subject's notsvation for artiliation la positive, spontaneoues

voluntary, and intense.

He liked the Americans but finds it a bit airfioure

to analyze this sentient.

He feela the Americans have nade certain

political mistakes but they reflected a fundamental and baste sinoerity

which he likes.

He understands the United States has political irterest

but he is willing to go along out of admiration for the sincerity of the

Americans. He is not looking for special compensation. Generaily, he is

quite willing to do what is asked without rational

reasons. In other

words, his motivation i8 typically emotional and is understandable in

terms of his character organization. He feels that a person in capable

of doing anything for love of nothing. He is inclined to put things on a

personal basis.. He doesn't belong to any community. He feels hie early

years in Georgia have had no effect on his way of thinking or on his way

of perceiving life. He likes the Ilberty which exists in America and the

fact that people are treated as individuals rather than as numbers.

80. Subject's motives are genuine and are compatible with his

outlook on Ille:

They are not necessarily original or sophisticated but

they are personal and therefore bona fide. Furthermore, Subject is really

on the shelf in Cap. He is controlled in his movements and is restricted

in his aspirations and consequently is unable to realize his freedom and

to develop himself as an Individual. Consequently, the assignment

represents a unique opportunity for. him to rise above his present re-

stricted level of existence.

81.

Subject 1s a very sensitive person and he attaches great in-

portance

to events

of life.

82. Another important characteristle la his curlosity and his loterest

83. Another interesting proclivity is Subject's tendency to assume

blame for the mistakes of othere even when he is not necessarily gutity.

As a child he wes girted but undisciplined and an unsultable student

who couldn't concentrate and adapt to the school altuation.

on? As a result

he was alveys in trouble but, more interestingly, he was alvaye glad to

assume responsibility for the anti-social actions of others:

whether

be did this for masochistic reasons or because he wanted to obtain the

approval of othere for whon he sacrificed lo difficult to deterane.

What la true, however, Is that he will subalt himself for punishment

even though he has not done wrong. He may do this out of friendship

In order to have others feel greatful to him. He has the attitude he

should be puniahed for doing wrong, but should not be degraded for doing

right. subject has always realized that he has needed help as regards

his emotional problems. He likes to be helped materially, not as and it-

self (?) but because material help involves the implication of moral

help. For example, a dentist in Gap offerfed to help subject in his in-

ventions without asking for advantages. This means a lot to subject. He

attaches small importance to money and he derives a tremendous satisfaction

out of helping others or being helped.

84. Subject reflects a tremendous vitality that has, in the past,

expressed itself through false attempts such as the bank robbery, etc.

He feels he is not being used as he should and that there is a power

within himself, a creative urge of movement, a power of realization.

It 1s highly emotionally charged and he feels he is capable of doing much

more: than he has in the past. Although he feels he is a complicated

person, he does not feel he is difficult to understand:

85. Subject likes to act intelligently and sensibly. He strives

for efflolency. For exampie, hurter if a person were to ask him to open

a window, he feels it is up to him to decide as regards the proper method.

The efficiency plus the results are his rewards. Consequently, he likes

practical work which involves an intellectual effort.

86.

subject has highly developed verbal Intelligence and he sa

able to amplity and elaborate on his ideas

87. Prior to the laet session on the 10th of january Subject was

routinely contacted by the French police mo vere investigating hie

activities in Parts at Chile time, Ab a result of this contact, he was

markedly apprehensive and pre-ocoupted With the seriousness of tnts Visit

by the police and vas not able to freely devote hieself to psycholosteal

analysis as heretofore. The important point here is that Subject in an

extremely alert and tellent persons la pripary nocine la, of courso,

sels preservatloa and he lo likely to over react and to become emotionally

upset with provocation. He needs the guiding influence of a more nature

and expertenced person who l8 in control of the situation.

88. Anöther Important aspect of his relationship with us appears to

be the fact that he conselously or unconsciously feels he has "arrived"

and 1s acceptable to us. In other words he feels that perhapa a deoision

has been made which is in his favor. This reflects his own desire to be

accepted together with his estimation of the situation.

89. This Indlvidual, despite his past explotts, is not necessarily

a hostile person. In other words he will not do harm nor will he hurt

others who are weaker than himself. He will act out of exigency but he

will deliberately avold being sadistic or wantonly cruel.

90. For some reason Subjeet exhibits & marked degree of loneliness

and isolation at this time. He seems to be seeking companionship.

91. Subject prefers to work alone as regards technical research, but

as regards the execution of an operation he prefers to be with someone or

part of an organization. He knows he can rely upon himself when he is

alone and

that others had been unreliable In his past. However, If it 18

necessary for h'm to work with two or more Individuals, he will accept it.

92.

subject admits of physical inferiority feelings by virtue of his

size and strength but he denies he has feelings of intellectual inferiority.

He depends more upon his mental faculties than upon his physical. "I have

no fear of an elephant if I have a gun."

93. Subject is a stubbom fellow who does not like to be defeated

and he strives to conquer.

94. subject almays looks for causes. He lo no magteal thinker but

conde to be rational and realistic despite his strong emotional re-activity

which can be almost explosive at timen.

95. Subject particularly strives not to be regarded as bad or evil.

In fact, he la not a ertainal type but 1s a neurotte character who bus

expressed his conflicty and difficulties in non-conforaing behaviour.

At the same time he to not anti-social. He la a person who has

dittorences of opinion and confliets vich the social order.

Subject does not regard hinself as an expert or

He realizes his short comings and he hopes his

will be

complemented by training.

97. Subjeet relles quite heavily upon humor for rellef of tension

and as a defense against the development of anxiety and inter-personal

relationshfps.

98.

An important aspect of this man's personality and history would

appear to be his so-called accident proneness.

He 1s. like the cat in the

Disney. film who, while chasing the mouse and having his entire attention

directed to the catching and incorporation of the mouse, inadvertantly

gets himself run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered

by the truck is one of disappointment as regards not arriving at the goal:

1.0., catching the mouse. He thereupon acts upon feelings of revenge on

the mouse for having caused his unfortunate aceident. In addition, this

example signifies that subject is likely to keep his eye too much upon the

goal and Insufficiently upon the hazards involved in reaching the goal. It

may be argued that Subject's philospphy in his past operations are related

In some manner to his lack of attention to such details. His history 1g

that of the unlucky eat who manages to get himself run over successfully.

99. This person can be quite discomposed by the surprise of un-

expected occurrences.

100. Despite defeat Subject is able to pick himself up, figure things

out, start all over in a more systematie may, and continue in his pursult

of his goal.. Consequently, he does learn by experience. His mistakes are

---

## Page 38

/23/

chiefly due to the fact that he is or has been "stupid" or Impulsive

stupid, impulsive, immature and Inexpertenced.

';*

101.

Subject is capable of experiencing melancholy or depressive

mood swings. Honever, he maintains a sey-facads and he attempts to

relteve bis depressive feelings with lightness. Underneath the gay

appearance, however. Is sertousness. One of the chief motives is hia

curlousity. He seeks the unknow but when he approaches the unknown, he

experiences a certain foeling which he recognizes as a threat to his

enot tonal security and he te ambivalent about proceeding or withdrawing.

He has on laternal fear of sonething which he doesn't know of understand

Becauso of this it may be necessary to provide his with fire support.

guldence, and consideration of all the possible eventualities. He has 4

fear of getting himself into something which he cannot set out of and hte

Immediate reaction is to turs around and go avay without having solved

the probleis. Consequently, he needs a person of greater intelligence sho

18 able to help him to evaluate the realitles of his situation or

predicament. It must be kept in mind that his self-preservation 18

stronger than his desire to solve problens.

102. subject is likely to be loyal to a superior and may even be

critical of himself in relation to the superior.

In other words, he would

like to be as useful as possible in order to express his loyalty, but may

feel Inadequate in that he reguires the pretection of his superior.

103. This person puts no stock in emblems or signs of rank or

reputation. He regards such signs as identifying labels only and is not

impressed or motivated for glory symbols. If he were to accomplish an

outstanding feat, he would not want a medal: all he would want was a

remark from an important figure to the efféct "well done, thank you."

He feels it is sufficient only for him to know he has done well.

104.

Subject will attempt to assume leadership on the team but

1t may be that 1f his partner 1s superior, he would be a better follower

than he would be a leader of a less adequate person. He Is more of a

dependent than independent person in terms.of his inter-personal relation-

ships; furthermore, he acts on sentiment and impulse and consequently

his judgment is questionable. This would indicate that he would work

better with a more soher-ninded, calculating Individual. He Is likely

## Page 39

/24/

to work beat with a person whom he respects and with whon he enjoys a

frendly but authoritative relationship.

105 here I's no reason why this person cannot be handled by an

experienced, mature case officer.

Gerin Documents, and developtas and or taproving toole and methods for

On 17 June 1980, It was decided that Project ASSSUTINEL

would not be cartied out. On receipt of this information SR/DOB en-

deavored to place subject elsevtere, where his training would be bené

11cial. The African Division expressed Interest and had agreed to uti-

Lize him as a result of assesspents. Durtig the period Pron the 21st

of October unt 1l dispatch, subject will be carried on ORA funds.

2.

Security Flaps -

A.

During the latter part of Wi Il subject was arrested by the Ger-

man police for forgery. He was not unduly held by the criminal investi

gation branch of the police but pessed on to the Gestapo.

Subject sas

brought to Berlin where be vas toterrogated for several months at

Gestapo Headquarters. Later he vas tried and sentenced to death. For

some unmown reason he was moved tron jail to jail, concertration camp to

concentration camp..

While in prison he resörted to a "ruse de guerre"

and told the Germans his father had Invented a motor that could run

without gasoline®

He offered to draw the designs of the notor and vas

able to stall long enough to be liberated by components of the advan..

cing U.S. Armye

B.

In 1946-47 subject and an aceomplice conmitted two robberies of

Jevelry stores.

C.

In 1949 subject röbbed a bank of 1,000,000 FT. IT.

His accomplice

bas apprehended and shortly thereafter confessed, implicating subject.

Subject was apprehended while attempting to cross the Franco-Spanish

border. He was

sentenced to ten years in prison of wbich he served

only five, receiving parole for good behavior. Upon release in 1955, he

was exiled on parole to Cap, France where he worked as an architect.

D.

To our knowledge thereis no indication that subject is lnown to

be associated with KUBARK.

Agent's knowledge of sensitive matters - has met the fOllowing KUPARKERS:

Anthony H. FRIGANZA (P)

Patrick B. NEWENS (P)

Subject does not kow that he is working for KUBARK. He knows that

he is connected with some Intelligence organization,

e-go; ODIERX. He

does not know anything about KUBARK organization nor 1ta modus oper

andi.

4. Security of meeting sites, communications, ete:

These will have to be worked out in the field by subject's case of

ficer. In general it le proposed to have him be surfaced In Germay

"as an

Austrian and from there; making his own way to leopoldville.

Tere he lo to establish a sunil repair or photo shop. Thie would pro-

vide a natural reason for his Co or anyone to visit him under the suise

of overt business. Longer meetlags would be held clandestinely as

determined by his CO. All coumnication channels will have to be vorted

out in the field. However until contact in established, a Becure emer-

geney channel with Headquarters is being established. This channel 18

to be used only in the event subject finds himself stranded or for

dire emergency.

So Security:

The agent is very security conscious and will follow auy direction

in the interest of secuirty

6. Control:

On this point here are several aspects for consideration.

Re 1e

under contract to us and although he le not too interested in money, he

does enjoy Its benefits and realizes that it will continue so long as

he does a good job.

The more: important built lo control is the fact

that he will be under. false documents, and being stateless, he 1e con-

pletely dependent on KUBARK to perpetunte his quasi legal exiatence and

to eventually legalize his status.

Added to this is the control which

stens from the prospect of resettlement in another country.

This vould

give him status as a citizen.

Reallzing these points, subject 1e more

than wiling to play ball with us.

7. Prior contacts with 'any security service:

stated In 3B (2) above, the only brush subject has bad in the

past.was with Gestapo and French police. These were prior to his re-

cruitnent by KUBARK and were not as a result of I.S. activity.

8. Trainine of agent:

Re had received training in covert black border operations. In ad-

dition, he is being trained

in srall arns and denolition.

a degree of latitude in novement and a cover for covert contact:

Subject has undergone plastic surgery in order to change his appearance,

also a toupe wus sade to further assist in the changing of his outvard

appearance.: This action bas designed to preclude any possibility of

recognition by former French associates, particularly since he 1s to

pass as an Austrian.:

The cover facility, as stated, will offer access

to all classes of people, it will provide a natuml beans for contact,

and will permit subject to make trips under the fuise of business tra-

vel.

WIROGUE/ will be required to set himself up

in business.

The

dearth of qualified technicians will help facilitate his opening an

establishment: WIROSUs/1 will need capital to set binself up, buy

needed supplies and bave sorking funds. For the purpose of provtding

him with funds to establish and open this cover business, ve will ad

vance him 000.00 as an orerational loan, to be secured with a non-

paid off, WIROGUE 18 to keep the profits he may make.

Fe will Initially transfer $1000:00 to & bank in Leopoldville. We

are certain that he will not abscond with the funds, since hie docu

mentation will be false and his rey and allowances total $8500 per

sanun, he would therefore stand to lose i great denl more than he would

gain.

Being a contrect agent, there is ample control if he shows signs of

spending too much time in

the pursuit of profits fron bis cover business.

His salary and allownces will be paid in part to & personal account

In Switzerland (separete fron his business account).

This money will

C.

Security Estimate:

WIROGUE had been recruited in France and exfiltrated black from West

Germany to SR, DOB.

He has had no known I.S. connections in the past.

He

will be surfaced in West Germny and will proceed to Leopoldville. He

will be documented as an Austrian.

4.

seckpround

The need for various technicians to stabilize the chaotic conditions in

Leopoldville coupled with an urgert need for controllad assets in that city gave

rise to this project.: WIROGUS's particular talents, experience, ability and

tratning open up a wide varietyof possibilities:

one, (and was, in fact, purchased by TSD/IB) and is therefore

backstopped in name,

Subject could apply at the Mexican Embassy

in West Germany for a Mexican tourist visa by presenting this

passport. Once in Mexico, Subject could request emigration

action upon declaration of intent to become a Mexican citizen and

upon submitting proof of sponsorship by an emplojer in Mexico

City.

2. Upon your concurrence, l

for introducing agency designees into Mexican private industry.

Jhas already talked with_

- on two occasions

and has passed him Subject's file. From their talks, E

has assured me that this arrangement is entirely feasible, Gillete

Company of Mexico City being cited as one possibility.

3. AÉASPIC would then openly proceed to purchase plane

tickets in West Germany for Mexico City and upon arrival there,

would be waiting for him. The time table for this entire operation

was estimated at about five weeks. Of course we did not discuss

Subject's monetary maintenance for the interim period of travel,

nor until Subject could begin earning his own living.

of

lof Alien Affairs Staff about the knowledgibility

of Subject re pass Agency tie-in and Agency assets. It will of

course be our job to assure Security thát Subject is not knowledgable

and will entail a minimum of risk to transport and to resettle in

Mexico, In view of this concern; all arrangements offered for

DOB's consideration by TSD/IB were tailored to afford step by

step denial or participation by the U.S. Government. In effect,

all items procured by Subject for resettlement could just as

easily be obtained on the European black market as well as from

this Government. Subject will in effect be briefed and taken by

German Station asset to. obtain his documents ostensibly on the

•black market. Monies due Subject would be withheld pending

destination arrival.

The letter head and supporting sponsorship

documents to be used by him for ultimate employment in Mexico

would be prepared in such a manner as to be either legitimate or

forged. In addition it was suggested that Subject be closely

bandled and advised by someone known to him to ensure the

security aspect both to Subject and to this agency.

5. The meeting was closed by TSD/IB's request to be

informed whether these arrangements in theory meet with the

approval.of SR/DOB, and Office of Security.

was explained byl

H/T training of an agent on a

full or part-time basis, 18 contingent upon the approval of a

specific project with supporting conmunications annex. Wulle

we have on occasion participated in "bolding" training of

agents without benefit of a definite requirenent, current

operational conmitments now make this impossible.

2. Should a definite requirement for the operational

utilization of AENSPIC develop we will arrange for the W/T

aptitude assessinent and

training.

Prior to our initiating

such action, it is requested that a representative of your

Office discuss operational details with an appropriate

Foreign Division within the Office of Coumunications. This

will enable us to tailor subsequent training in terms of

specific equiprent and procedures as required by the project.

ry congratulations.

His father's condition is very bade he are afraid it is a tumor

of the lung. Unfortunately, when one says tumor, one often mcans cancers. I hope

to God that I am mistaken. Little (eligible) the cousin of Paraz had a fine boy

named Christophe; and that's the latest news!

The children should write you every day, but if you want to chew them oute

here is Nina's address: Mne. Monestler, 259 Bd. Auguste Elanqui, Parie 13.

Nelly has been working since last Monday in a very stylish and territly

expensive little shop.

The Job of sales clerk seens to agree with her. It is a

store for expensive lingerie at the corner of rue Miromesnil and St.. Honore.

I am writing you all curled up in the corner of the kitchen for we are out

of beat and today, alter a few days of radiant sunshine it 1s raining in torrentel

What crimes must I have committed in a previous life to lead such an ugly:

the meantime, I kiss you

Par18; March 25, 1960

Dear "Ecuardo,"

Everybody was very happy to hear from you again.. You now that Mind and

Mama have alroady voltion you as woll as, undoubtedly, Nina and Nelly. Therefore,

I'" the very last to write you but that doesn't mean that I don't think of you

It's almost a year since you left. Iine passes rather quickly in spite al

everything. Everybody wat have already told you the nost important news. So

much the vorce 1f I talk nonsense.

Last August 15 I went to neet Tit1 in Algeria. We returned together early

In October. A whole yoar paased ulthout our seeing each other, but with letters

every day, and we found each other as if we had parted the day before, or almost.

It was funry to see Titl exercising his functions as a second Ileutenant with a

section under his orders. what a pleasure to find myself with him there. Now

when Bebert, and compary speak of alitary service I can join then. The life of

an offloer'a vilo la not so bade One 18 spotledi The first month no ware at

the sea shore. Since I love the heat this was just the thing for mel Titl left

every norning at 5 o'clock to join his secton 25 km from the place where I vas

staying and returned only at l o'clock in the afternoong the weeks passed

quickly except for the beach … and still ve could not go very far becmse of the

guerrillas! In short, apart fron going out to lunch, I stayed, so to speak,

shattered up in wy roon waiting for the return of ry lord and masters. I tried

to go swiming alone, but the city and the beach were full of soldiers and I gave

up quickly. You cannot imagine I think, what 1t's Ilke to eat alone as a woman

in a restaurant dining roon full of soldiers. I did not dare to raise my eyes

son ty plate and, to feel looked et unile eating, makes you becona clunsy. Hardly

was plenty of jouth but then too they looked at se like à China doll. That a

enough for my "military serico".

Tits went backto the school of fine arto, herg coudng along fine. Unless

someone offers hin a vonderful pooltion he will contime at the school. It wdll

be very long! fe also works for an architectinl fira. Pinally you know the

procedure having almost been in it yourself, we sre looking for an apartment.

tis would 11ko to have a home of our own. Certain people don't understand vio

so vant to leayo la rue fabanda since there's enough room there. First at all

there isn't that richd He have to queup for the dath room, 1l TitI wants to

walk around in his shorts he can't do 1t (1t!3 not that he la accustomed to doing

this sort of thing) and the people ean hear everything that's going on in the

room. And then again 1t's very understandable that ve want to have a place of

our oun which we will furnish as we like and there we will live as we like. To

spend a full day in bed or to eat at one o'clock in the norning, etc, -and there

too, there is also a little friction between Mana and ne. Ild like to shake her

"o. If you can do 1t by letter don't hesitate.. She's gatting bitter how can sho

do otherwise. She does nothing or next to nothing and she's letting herself go.

She could be so cute 1f she did what's necessary to get thin, and despite her

l5 summers she's stili well-built. What she needs 1s a man to take care of her,

to take her out and pull her out of her comatose or almost comstose state.

shake her up often but as for me I am abrupt and sonotines I say what should not

be saldo I'd like to find her a part-time Job, sorething pleasant which would

cause her to get out, take a walk, sea people, ote. Evidently the house 18 leas

gay than previously and, nevertheless; we are still hero. What will 1t ba like

when only Nelly will remain who is hardly ever here because she goes out with

Rasas. And then there's another thing people criticise Mama because they see

her with nothing to do • I allow myself to critieise, but I rofuse to hear

across the street fron the retro Glaciero. They found an apartmant; but, hold on

to yoursol? 1, 600, 200 manes dopostt. It's craxy. It's their fraudfates

who loaned then the money which they are paying back at the rate of 10,000 traca

per months. They have received many gifts and are completely furnished, he see

them frequentlye Nelly went to a beautlosen school which lasted three months.

She liked it very much, but after

Pating out, she didn't find a Job. Through one

of i friends I found her a Job as a bestntnig sales clerk while waiting, birt

perhaps at the end she'll like being a sales clerk better. She's been vorking

since Mondayo Nina 1s still in the sane Jobo. She's saiting impatiently for

Bernard to make enough money so she won't have to worke

Mud 1s still the same fortunataly. As for me, Ilye changed professions.

I am a sodel. Don', laughe Evidently I am beginniag In this career, but I hope 1t

will work oute.

One can earn a lot of money and it's a tiring buainess but pleasant

and lexinine and a lot nore interesting than the job as secretary where you rest:

your behind on a chalr all day.

I began at the beginning of November and I worked

until the month of March. I've been unemployed since then, but I'm doing a lot

of looking ground to find sonething. The mannequin "cablnes" are formed only

toward the end of May. I must take some photo tryouts next veeke Photography

brings in much nore. If only le works out I'd like it very mucho

What sore can I vite you! we see louls and Nethela quite often. Withela

has changed jobs and is now sarning 150, 100 franes a month. Not bad! Furry up

and write us and tell us about the things jou're seeing. Do you Ilke Brazil?
