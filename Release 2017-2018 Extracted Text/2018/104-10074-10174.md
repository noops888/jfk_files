-" 1. "One of our sources in Miami, Joseph Merola, revealed
the ‘name ‘and position of an individual reported to be an Agency.’
‘official in El Salvador to Matt MacVane during the. course of an
interview on 21 December 1973, This was reported in MIM-006-74:.
4-January' 1974. ‘This report was forwarded to the El Salvador
Desk on 8 January 1974. On 16 January 1974 the Desk requested
that DCD obtain the name of the individual mentioned ia this
memorandum who said he knew a CIA officer in the Embassy.,,This
request was passed by telecon and TWX to MacVane by| 3h
16 January 1974. The El Salvador Desk also question tl
reliability of our source, Joseph Merola, at this time and
requested we query Miami as to his reliability. 2

2. On 17 January 1974 at the request of MacVane [1]
visited the El Salvador Desk to ascertain their objections to
our source, known to us as a convicted felon. Desk objections
stemmed from a 1964 report which indicated that Merola had
informed persons that he was a "CIA agent". Further conversa~
tion elicited the fact that Merola had again made this state-
ment in 1973 at an Embassy function. We advised the Desk that
DCD was well aware of Merola's criminal background but that he
had provided DCD with reliable reports in the past ‘unrelated
to his own "pursuits".

‘The El Salvador desk confirmed the fact that’ the

ividyal’mentioned by Merola‘'s informant as being .a.CIA
officer'was-in fact such. Ryan advised MacVane of this per 2
