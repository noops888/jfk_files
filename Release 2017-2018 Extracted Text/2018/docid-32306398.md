For the information of the Bureau, reMM let

furnished a copy of the mimeographed letter soliciting

MORENO's cooperation in furnishing information of an

ntel

ligence nature to the Cuban Government.

On July 21 and September 23, 1965, MARIA MORENO

BALBUENA) (currently residing 927 S. W. 3rd

Street, Apart-

ment 4), advised she has received no further correspondence

soliciting her cooperation in furnishing information of an

intelligence nature to the Cuban Government. She stated

she would immediately advise the FBI should she receive

any further correspondence. MARIA MORENO (BALBUENA) has

stated she intends to take no action in regard to answering

the letter she received out of fear of jeopardizing her

chances of getting her daughters out of Cuba. It appears'

she has little, if any, potential for development as a

PSI, and for this reason her case is being closed.
