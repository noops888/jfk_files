IN THE UNITED STATES; IS- CUBA."

ADMINISTRATIVE

On June 30, 1959, and on July 31, 1959, PSI

VENANCIO LOPEZ SOSA, who is under development by the

Miami Office, was questioned as to his testifying concerning

the information which he had furnished with regard to the

meeting he attended on June 1, 1959, at the home of

JUSTO LUIS POZO del PUERTO.

LOPEZ

stated that he does

not desire to testify concerning the matter as he fears

for his life and the life of his family if he should do

SO.

It is noted that the development of LOPEZ

as a PSI has been discontinued due to reports that

he is furnishing information to the present Cuban

Government and because it was reported by others present

at the meeting on June 1, 1959, that LOPEZ failed to

furnish the identity of two other individuals who were

there who were known to him, because they were friends.

When subsequently questioned as to whether there were

not more individuals present at the meeting, LOPEZ

stated that he could not recall the identities of any

of the others. It is also noted that ROBERT WILLIAMS,

then under development as a PSI in the Miami Office also,

was present at the above meeting and furnished substantially

the same information as LOPEZ concerning the contents of

the meeting, however, WILLIAMS, who is known to Lorr,

also furnished LOPEZ' name and

the name of WILLIAM JOHNSON,

a former friend of LOPEZ, whom LOPEZ would not identify.

CONFLENTIN.

PSI ROBERT WILLIAMS indicated upon originally

being contacted concerning his possible development as

a PSI that he had no objection to testifying to information

furnished by him should it become absolutely necessary.

However, development of WILLIAMS as a PSI has been

discontinued due to instructions contained in Bureau

letter to Miami dated June 30, 1959, entitled, "ROBERT

ARTHUR WILLIAMS; PSI - CUBA. "

In this letter, it was

stated that due

to the indication that WILLIAMS may be

bordering on mental instability and in view of the

diagnosis set forth in St. Louis letter dated June 11,

1959, no further effort should be made to develop WILLIAMS

as a

PSI.

In view of the above, it does not appear that

LOPEZ or WILLIAMS would be desirable witnesses.

In view of the information set forth below,

it is believed that information concerning the activities

Of ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS and of JUSTO LUIS

POZO del PUERTO can better be reported in the individual

case files which have been opened on each of them in the

Miami Office.

In view of the fact that the proposed plan

for the attack on the Isle of Pines was discarded

on approximately June 13, 1959, according to information

furnished by WILLIAMS on June 17, 1959, and confirmed on

June 21, 1959, by RICHARD JAFFE, an American pilot associated

with ex-Cuban

Senator ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS,

and because no indication has been received that any

such plan of attack has been reconsidered or that airplanes

mentioned in connection with the plan have been purchased

and because the Cuban Government has now reinforce the

Isle of Pines garrison with

veteran Cuban Revolutionary

Army men known as "Barbudos" and lastly because no

indication was ever received that PEDRO DIAZ supposedly

in charge of the demolition and sabotage activities in

the Isle of Pines had ever left the Isle of Pines.

CONFIDENTIAL

In view of the above, it is believed more

economical and advisable to close instant case and to

continue reporting individual information concerning

MASFERRER and POZO and any other individuals whose

names are herein mentioned in individual case files

which are opened in the Miami Office.

Miami is not requesting permission to interview

MASFERRER at this time inasmuch as permission has been

requested to interview POZO and it is believed that it

would be advantageous to have in Miami's possession any

information furnished by POZO prior to an interview with

MASFERRER.

This is believed advisable in view of the

fact that MASFERRER has been interviewed on two previous.

occasions and has not furnished any information which

would indicate that he was engaged in ANTI-FIDEL CASTRO

ACTIVITY.

Results of said interviews, when conducted, will

be reported in individual case files.

On July 31, 1959, ELOISE ERICSON, Clerk in the

Miami Office, who has relatives on the Isle of Pines in

Cuba, advised that she visited the Isle of Pines on

June 5, 1959, and at that time, noticed detachments

of Barbudos training and marching in the various areas

of the island.

She stated that she stayed with relatives near

the Nueva Gerona Airport on Isle of Pines and saw numerous

Barbudos at and

around the airport.
