3. A Cuban revolt well conceived, timed, executed, and supported overtly

by US military forces could destroy the Cuban Government in being and

establish in its stead a government friendly to the US. The requisite

conditions of timing and execution suggest that they can be assured best by

US initiation and control of the enterprise by covert means.

4.

Operations in accordance with the general concept presented herein are

designed to create the-conditions under which the US could participate in

Free Cuban revolutionary activities and ultimately initiate overt large scale

military operations in Cuba without subjecting the US to unacceptable

censure.

To achieve the desired result, however, activities of CIA, State,

DOD and USIA must be coordinated in an over-all plan.

5. General Concept.

The calendar of events in enclosure (1) will bring these

operations to fruition in about 18 months. The program could be compressed

to about 15 months provided that initial decisions and initial actións required

to coordinate the activities of all concerned agencies were expedited.

CIA would begin as soon as practicable to introduce assets into

Cuba to develop intelligence required for successful UW operations.

b. Concurrently, State would initiate action to ensure the organization

of Cuban factions into a single, cohesive political organization, and

establish a Free Cuban Government in Exile, preferably in a Latin American

country-

DOD (The Military Services) in conjunction with CIA and CINCLANT

would train Cuban nationals for operations with US UW forces.

d. USIA would develop and execute a propaganda plan to support the

US program.

DOD (CINCLANT) would initiate CINCLANT 380-63 on/about 15

January 1964 by infiltrating UW forces into Cuba for area assessment,

establishing guerrilla bases, developing military assets, establishing

escape and evasion nets and conducting subversion. On about 15 June 1964,

UW forces would be augmented and would accelerate subversive operations

to create conditions favorable to establishing a Free Cuban Government on

Cuban soil and for employing conventional forces.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

Subject:: JOS 2304/171 - Action in Cuba (U)

1. The Note by the Secretaries, dated 15 March 1963,

indicates that the subject report is desired by 26 March

1963.

However, the comment and recommendation therein

will be based mainly on the decision reached by the

Joint Chiefs of Staff concerning JCS 2304/172 now on

2s go outc

the agenda for Friday, 22 March 1963. Because of this,

it is believed that more time will be required to pro-

cess the paper through the Joint Staff and the Services

than is now contemplated.

2. Therefore, it is requested that the desired date

of submission of JCS 2304/171 be changed from 26 March

1963 to

that of being completed as a matter of priority

after a

decision is reached on JOS 2304/172.

Concept for Cover Plan

Proposed Preliminary Requirements and Task Assignments

1. The purposeful application of US force last fall met with apparent

success in frustrating Rússia's attempt to establish a military offensive

system in Cuba. Our concern over the communist influence in Cuba,

however, still remains. Continued domination of the Castro Govern-

ment, primarily by the USSR, but potentially by Communist China, is

increasingly unacceptable to United States interests in Free World leader-

shi?, Western Hemisphere orientation to denocratic principles and

military security.

We are still faced with the problem of supplanting the

present communist dominated Government of Cuba with a government

friendly to the United States and compatible with the aims and principles of

the Organization of American States.

2.

Resolution of the problem through an overt military invasion, while

militarily feasible, would at this time jeopardize those US interests other

than military security. Further, it appears unlikely that, without overt

US military support, an internal revolt could achieve more than a fleeting

success in light of the efficacy of communist control over the Cuban

Government and military forces. It is also unlikely that any one, or group,

of Latin American countries would provide the degree of support needed to

assure success of a purely internal Cuban revolt.

A Cuban revolt well conceived, timed, executed, and supported overtly

establish in its stead a government friendly to the US.

The requisite

To achieve the desired result, however, activities of CIA, State,

5. General Concept.

The calendar of events in enclosure (1) will bring these

operations to fruition in about 18 months. The program could be compressed

to about 15 months provided that initial decisions and initial actions required

to coordinate the activities of all concerned agencies were expedited.

CIA would begin as soon as practicable to introduce assets into

of Cuban factions into a single, cohesive political organization, and

establish a Free Cuban Government in Exile, preferably in a Latin American

d. USIA would develop and execute a propaganda plan to support the

US program.

January 1964 by infiltrating UW forces into Cuba for area assessment,

establishing guerrilla bases, developing military assets, establishing

escape and evasion nets and conducting subversion. On about 15 June 1964,

UW forces would be augmented and would accelerate subversive operations

to create conditions favorable to establishing a Free. Cuban Government on

Cuban soil and for employing conventional forces:

f.

DOD would provide necessary support to establish the Free Cuban

Government on Cuban soil on about 15 July 1964. Once established, even

tenuously, the Free Cuban Government would request US assistance.

CINCLANT on about 15 July would begin mobilizing forces for US

conventional operations in Cuba (see cover plan in enclosure (2)).

h.

CINCLANT OPLAN 312-63 would be executed on about 26 July 1964,

followed by D-Day of OPLAN 316-63, or other approved military plan, on

about 3 August 1964.

1.

ICS would prepare and execute a cover plan for the over-all

opiration. It is suggested that the items in enclosure (2) be included therein.

6. This conceptual plan would provide for:

Incremental steps in replacing the present communist dominated

government of Cuba by infiltration, subversion, unconventional warfare,

limited conventional actions and finally full-scale invasion, in that order,

i necessary.

The capability of US to withdraw at any point in the process if

uniavorable international reactions or pressures require it; or if the Cuban

people themselves, in a successful revolt, overthrow the present regime

and form a government favorable to US interests.

c.

An ambiguous atmosphere during the critical phases in its

development which would not present the Soviets with a direct confrontation

ci power until events would preclude timelyiaction on their part to prevent

our intended result in Cuba.

Utilization of the OAS Forum and support without being dependent

upon OAS approval or disapproval for the necessary intermediate steps

leading up to OAS recognition of a Cuban Government in Exile and the final,

dacisive military action.

Maximum utilization of the Cuban refugee elements in the US for

political and military support without depending upon their effectiveness

¡ur the ultimate success of the plan.

A definite time scale of events culminating in the defeat of Castro's

7. If this concept is approved, I intend to proceed with the preparation of

detailed military operational plans.

As a prerequisite to the planning,

answers to the following questions are required:

Can CIA provide timely intelligence on Cuba and develop the assets

necessary for UW operations to be initiated on 15 January 1964?

Can the State Department take the steps necessary to effect the

organization of a Free Cuban Government in Exile and establish that govern-

ment in Latin America in sufficient time to fulfill the requirements of the

time scale illustrated in enclosure (1)?

In the event that 7.a. and 7.b. above are considered feasible and those

agencies are authorized to proceed with the necessary actions, enclosure

Concept for Cover Plan

1.

General: The concept for operations in Cuba is based on an assumption

that overt military operations against Cuba at this time would be inimical

to US international political interests.

The US will resort to overt military

operations only in a favorable political climate.

2. Objectives: The objectives in this plan are to:

÷.

opcrations.

Create a political climate suited to initiating US overt military

b. Provide a cover for unconventional warfare operations in Cuba.

c.

Provide a cover for the mobilization of forces for large scale

conventional operations in Cuba.

3.

Concept: It will be necessary, in order to safeguard US objectives and

interests, that US covert military operations be conducted behind the facade

oi an apparently strong, independent Free Cuban Government in Exile.

a.

Establish Free Cuban Government.

(1) Action: Provide strong political support to organization of the

Free Cuban Government.

(2)

Cover: Publicly disavow any association with the Free Cuban

Government although expressing sympathy with its aims.

•. Davelop Military Force.

(1) Action: Provide facilities, equipment and training for a Free

Cuban Government military force.

(2) Cover: Decry violations of US Neutrality Act.

Action:

Provide funds necessary to support development.of

ailitary force.
