when KELLY became fully awave of the extent of BURGART's
luerative wagering business, he felt that BURGART should bo

- ‘pulled into line" with the other small operators in the Mew

Kensington area and forced to become a low-level part of the
organization by turning in all wagers to MANNARINO cojiectors.
BURGART hag consistently vefused, with the result that RELLY
ig increasingly annoyed and letely has been trying to steal
BURGART's long-time customers. He has done this through threats
af physical harm, by spreading rumors that BUAGART is not
financially able te pay wins, and by attempting to have New
Kensington ice harass BURQART. This latter move has been
unsuccessful because of BURGART'’s close friendship with Mayor
RAYMOND GARDLOCK. On the other hand, the other methods used
by KELLY MARNMARING have been more successful, and BURGART'sS
business has suffered a loa of almost one-half.

Because of the above, BUAGART is willing te assist the PBI in

any fashion, except that he is insistent that he will never, under
any circumstences, testify at any sort of proceeding, local or
Federal. A POT file will be opened concerning BURGARY.

On 5/19/61, 0 615~C advised $A FORSYTH ap follows:

SAM MANNARING has fixed up a room in the basement of the Bonfire
Restaurant, near Leechburg, Pa., whieh looks ap though 4t could
be used as a mecting place. Informant will submit a drawing of
this voom and ite relation tw other parts of the building.

GAPRIEL HAWNARING has acquired a mate@ pair of Doberman Pinscher
doge, along with two puppies. The older dogs have been trained
as “attack dogs." fhe price of the dogs is rumored to be in
excess of $2,000.
