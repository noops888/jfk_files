Shep: Re HSCA request 6 July 78 (OLC 78-2491)

Para 3: We have no record of any transcripts or recordings of conversations of Jack

or Win Scott. If any exist should be in Cl Stati.

Fara 4: Annie Goodpasture wrote a history of the Mexico Station for the lestern Hemi

phere Division not the White House. This history covers the period from the inceptio

of the Station in Ito 1969. There is very little material dealing with the kenned

assassination but a great deal of material relating tol

land overations,not related to the asta investigacion. Ic is imposside to san

itize this tome and the "soft file" docyments do not exist. There is a bibliography but

again precious little pertains.

Where to now?
