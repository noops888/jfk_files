ATTN:

Shep: Re HSCA request 6 July 78 (OLC 78-2491) i
_ Bara_3: We have no record of any transcripts or recordings of conversations of Sack
‘Whitten}or Win Scott. If any exist should be in CI Staff. fi

Fara 4: Annie Goodpasture wrote a history of the Mexico Station for the Western Hemi-
sphere Division not the White House. This history covers the period from the inception
of the Station in[__|lto 1969. There is very little ma aling with the Kenne:
assassination but a great deal of material relating tol

jand operations..not related to the HSCA investigation, It is impossible to san-

itize this tome and the “soft file" docyments do not exist. There is a bibliography but
again precious little pertains.

Where to now?
