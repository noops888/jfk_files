Regarding Lead #4, inquiry in the vicinity of

the Standard 011 Station at

this station is operated by Cubans and that almost all business

is with Cuban exiles. In an effort to obtain some coverage

on this station on the possibility that the SNFE is obtaining

gasoline there, Mr. RAY STAMPER, owner of the Amoco Station

on the opposite corner, has been contacted as a source in this

regard.

STAMPER 1s most cooperative, anti-Cuban, and stated

he will immediately contact the office when he observes

large amounts of gasoline being purchased from this station.

STAMPER said that on several occasions in the past he had

observed as many as six 55-gallon drums being loaded and

transported from the station during the course of one day by

Individuals whom he considered to be Cubans.

No direct

contact will be made with the proprietor of the Standard

Station at this time.

Regarding the information furnished by CIA concerning

alleged surveillance by FBI, it 1s to be noted that the only

On June 19, 1963, MM T-1, another Government

agency which conducts personnel and intelligence

del Pueblo (MRP), had confided in a private conversation

during mid-May,

1963, that the alliance between the

MRP and the SNFE and Alpha 66 was engaged in raising

funds for a major operation called "Plan Omega"

did not have the details of this plan but said

It would be a bigger operation than a single attack on

Soviet personnel or installations in Cuba and that the

launching of the plan depended on the success of the

fund raising campaign.

He said that

the "milltary" wings of this

alliance; the SNFE and Alpha 66, had announced their

Intention of keeping 90% of their collected money in

military equipment and operations, and had called on the

other organizations with which they were in close contact

to do the same.

These groups Included the 30th of

November, the Montecristi, an unnamed formerly anti-

BATISTA

organization, and the Anti-communist Front of

Liberation.
