JOHN HOWARD LAWSON

948 BLYRIA. DRIVE

LOS ANGELES 6S, CALIFORNLA

June 25th, 1956

Dear Mr. Schlichting:

• I have delayed a little in

answering your letter of lay 30th, in the hope that

the art books which you mention as being sent to ne

would arrive. They have not yet appeared, but the delay

is natural enough, and I look forward mont eagerly to

receiving them. I read German very badly, but will be

able to study them with the help of friends - and will

certainly do so.

As for terms for the translation and .

publication of "THEORY AND TECHNIQUE,"'I shall be glad

"to have it done on the same torms-as for "

"FILM IN THE

BATTLE OF IDEAS." I believe the publishers of the

latter (Masses & Mainstream, 832 Broadway, N. Y.)

made a proposal regarding terms. I regret to say that

Iam very vague about the actual figures that were suggested.

In any case, I am agresable to any arrangement that is

customary

and proper. If you will suggest whatever the

German publisher feels is a fair offer,

and in

accord with general procedure for a work of this type,

I am sure it will be satisfactory.

with friendly greetings,

CONFIDENTIAL
