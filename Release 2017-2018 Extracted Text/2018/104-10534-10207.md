“Appropristeness

In our inquiries imto the appropriatencss of the regulations
on control of firearms, we repeatedly encoantered officers in beth
the Support and the Plane Directorates who feel quite streagly that
there should be one central point of control, or at least of cognizance,
of the Agency's dealinge in firearms. There is ne such central point H
now, although it seems to us that the import of the regulations is
that ® centralized control of flrearma within the Clandestine Service
was envisioned. We are aot sure that a point of central cognisance
is needed, but we do bolleve that the desirability of it shonld be takes
ander consideration.

Recommendation No. 3 i

‘That the Deputy Director for Plans have a
review made of the desirability asd practicality
of establishing s central palat of cognizance of |
all Grearme holdings and transactions withia the
Directorate for Plans,

25X1A

Recommendation No. 4

That the Deputy Director for Plans, by
whatever mesus he considers appropriate, extend
to fabound and iateral pouches a degree of control
over the pauching of firearms equivalent to the
control that exists ever outbound pouches,

The regulations onthe procurement, shipping, storage, and
handling of firearms, with very minor exceptions, address themeelves
to the broad subject of government property ta general. Firearms

are looked upon a: erely as one of many categories of property.
We do not ses this as a significant deficieacy. The supply
procedures established for the control of all aon-expendable
Agency property seem to us adequate in the case of firearms.

Consietency

We find no major contradictions among the provisions of
the several regulations having to do with the central of firsarms.
There are, however, a namber of instances in which the guidance,
if not actually contradictory, at least gives rise to uncertaiaties
in the minda ef some of those who mast deal with firearms. There
are enough of these seeming contradictions to call for a review of
the regulations on control of firearms for consistency within and
among the regulations.

Recommendation No. 5

That the Deputy Director for Support, in
consultation with the Deputy Director for Plans,
initiate a review of existing Agency regulations,
te include Clandestine Service lnstractions, with
& view toward identifying and eliminating possible
areas of conflict among the various Regulations
and Instructions.

What Are the Checks on Compliance with the Regulations °

The periadic and continuing checks consist of audits by the
Audit Staff, security surveys by the Office of ‘Secarity a ea
Logistics checks on questionable
requisitions, and the mechaniems for the reporting of general
property and financial accountability. We consider the checks to
be effective. One additional check occurs to us, which is readily
available bat ie not now applied. There is act now a requirament
on the Cable Secretary for the diesemination to the DD/P ef cables
dealing with the contrel of firearms, We believe that it would be
appropriate for the DD/P to receive copies ef cables on this subject
in view of the extent to which he has reserved to himself authorities
io thie field.

25X1A



SECRET

Recommendation No. 6

That the Deputy Director for Plans review
hie requirements on the Cable Secretary for
dissemiaation of cables and consider adding to
them a requirement for the diasemination to his
office of all cables dealiag with control of firearms,

Are the Regulations Kaown, Understood, aud Followed :

We find that perseanel who deal with firearms are aware of
the applicable regulations and have a moderately good anderstanding
ofthem. The degree of compliance with the regulations ie met easy
to assess, but we have the impreseion that it is high, The regula-
ticas are followed wall while the firearme are in or moving through
established supply chanasia; however, regulatory controls are aot
always applicable in as operational envirosment. Whea we are
faced in the Agency with an operational exigency, we have 20 choice
but to do the best we cao with the means available to us. [It is not
a case of regulations ~be-damned but of recognizing that the rege-
lations are aot absolutely binding at all times and in all sitaations.

Can the Regutations Be Circumveated Without Risk of Detection /

Our inclination ie to give a flat “no” to thie question, but
thera ie a possibility--altheugh a very slight one~-that a dishonest
employse could acquire a small quantity of weapons for unsuthorized
age without too much risk of his being associated with them. The
examples we cite ia our detailed report are quite far-fetched, and
they assume a lack of integrity on the part of an employee. The
consensus is that, while it would be impossible to write a regulation
that would prevent a dishonest employee from engaging ic an illegal
firearms transaction, our existing regulatioas are euch that he
would almest surely be caught.

Are There Past or Present Fircarma Transactions That May
Embarrass Us Is The Fature -

Any iadividual weapon that ls traceable to CIA is a potential

source of future embarragsment, because we have almost no control
over what happens te it after it leaves our hands. The potential for

ny

SaeoRet

embarrassment over a aingla traceable weapon that goes astray
ie oot high: asually the fact of ite having gone astray bec
known when it is seized by U.S. law enforcement authorities.

A tracing of ite ownership history leads te CIA, and our records
will reveal the disposition made of it by the Agency.

There ate, however, some old large-volume firearms
transactions, which might one day be the source of quantities of
weapons traceable to CIA appearing on the illegal market. The

Fallacious Allegations of CIA Involvement in Hiegal Arms Deals
We examined a number of instances in which CLA has been
falsely accused of affiliation with an illegal arms transaction. We
have on occasion provided certifications that an individual had no
connection with CIA, but in masse triale of people some of who may
have had prior CIA affiliation we prefer not to do this. We are
Ukely always to be plagued by incidents tik jand

there often is little we can do other than be ppy over the
atlegations,

How Important Are the Regulations ¢

Of course the regulations are important--iadiapensable, in
fact--and it would be foolish of as to suggest otherwise. We ack
the question as a means of focusing atteation on a form of control
thet operates perhaps even more effectively than do the controle
that are spelled out in the regulations. We are referring to some-
thing that might be called state of mind, or attitade, or atmosphere.
We found a universal awareness that firearms, while treated ae
just another item of supply in the genoral supply regulations, are
in reality a very special kind of property requiring special types of
handling. It is widely believed that the epper echelons of the Agency
would prefer to have no traffic at all with fizearme and are likely

25X1A



SECRET

ett

to deal perermptorily with offenders who knowingly try to circamvent
controle. This is not to cay that people are running scared; it is
just that they know what the general policy is, and they reepect it.

What is perbaps most notable is the extent to which current
attitedes with reapect to firearms differ from attitudes that were

- prevalent in the Agency during its eariier years. Today's outlook

on weapons procurement in the Office of Logistics is characterized
‘by caution and conservatism. Withia the Clandestine Service, there
are variations in outlooks on firearms arising largely from differing
conditions in the foreign field. Even allowing for these variatione
in attitudes, we think it fair to eay that the Clandeatine Service, too,
is living la a new era in which it is uaderstood thet firearms will
play s amail and closely monitored role. :

ORIGIS AXD SCOPE OF T2 REVIEW

1. This inquiry into the adequacy of Agoncy regulations on the
control of firearms orijinated as an ection item from the Director's
noraing meeting cf 14 October 1969. ‘Tac Deputy Director for Support
noted the iten by Martin Waldron in that day's New York Times, “Arcs
Linked to "Agency,’” and comcated that, had we been involved cs
alleged, we would have known it. (The Waldroa article reportea the
seizure last June of a five-toa cache of arms on the form of Earl Vv.
Redick, a firearms dealer ia Tuyetteville, North Carolina. Redicx
claimed that the asus were cuned by a Henry Vizanar, who reportedly
was acting on behalf of an ummaued “Feceral Agency,” and that thoy
were destined for the Republic of Chad.) To assure himself that we
would indeed have known it, if we hed been Involved in thia trancacticn,
the Director instructed the Inspector General to examine and report on
8lL Agency xegulations pertaining to the shipment and requisitioning
of firearms.

2. We made a quite thorough investigation of all aspects of the
Agency's involvement with firearms. This included identification and

detailed study of the regulations thexselves, examination of many

files, and a large surber of interviews of employees whous work might

ve expected to requlie thes to be faniliar with and to abide by our i
Yegulations on the control of fincarss. Tasse ara the questioss to
Vaich we sought ansvers: i

What is the nature ona extent of the Agency's involvenent with
firearns?

Which of ou reguintions yortein to control of firenms?
ara the reguintions complete, avpropriate, and consistent?
Ave the regulations knom, understood, ond followed?

What are the checks on compliauce with the reguistions?
Can the regulations be circumvented without detection?

Are there past or preceit firearms traisactions thes may
embarrass us in the Aiture?

Row important are the regulations in thengelves? .

We take up each of these questions in succeeding sections. in one
section ve have a brief Giscussion of fallacious allegstions of CLA
davolvenent in various illegal arms denis. These false accusations
somatines have an air of credioility about them, and trying to dice
rove them might risk more than it would be worth. There 1g on amex
attacked to the report ax Tab 3 examining one of these follacious
allegations in detall. It describes two incidents in the Zev Orlesns
area, which District Attorney Janes Garrison tried to link to CLA ond
to the assassination of President Kennedy.

WHAT ARE THE CHECKS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS?

i. There aro a nuzber of checks on compliance vith the regulations
on the control of fixearns. Some of them are in the form of periodic
reviews, and some operate continuously within the procurement cyclic.
We have no way of evaluating the effectiveness of these checks, but
we have the impression that they give reasonably good assurance that
nothing could go seriously cmies and remain that way for long. These
ere the checks of which ve are avaxe:

& The Audit Steff, in its anmal audits of all Agcacy
installations, routinely checks on compliance with the :

aii provictondgam maaan on ‘the storage, control of issuance, and

xeporting of inventory of firearms. During the course of this

Divisions instructing then to make sure that any requisition

something about the source of the request and the ultinate

in view of the extent to which he has reserved to himself anthoritics
in this field. We note in this regard that the £6A/DDS, who

firearms are aware of the applicable reguiations and have a

HOW DPORTANT ARS THE REGULATIONS?

2. Of cource the regulations are iuportant--indispensadle, in
factmand At would be foolish of us to mazest otherwise. We ask the
question a9 a means of focusing attention on a form of control that
operates perhaps even more effectively than do the controls thet are
gpelled out in the reguintions. We aro referring to something that
might be called state of mind, or attitude, or atwosphere. We found
© universal evareness that firearms, while treated as just another
Sten of eupply tn the general eupply regulations, are in roelity «
very special kind of property requiring special types of handling.
Zt ia widely believed that tho upper echelona of the dgenay would
prefer to have no traffic at all with firearms and are likely to
Scal poremptorily with offenters who knowingly try to circumvent
sontzsola. This is not to say thet people are running soared; 1t is
ust that thay know what the general policy is, and they rospect it.

2. What is perhaps most notable is the extent to which current
attitudes with respect to firearms diter from attitudes that vere
prevalent in the Agency during ite cerlier yeara. Early in this
paper ve romrked that ordnance ts big business in CIAe-unt this to

the Office of Logistics 4s characterized ty caution and conservatisn.
Within the Clentestine Service, there axe variations in outlooks on
fircorms eriaing largely from differing conditions in the foreign
field. Latin Americans and Africans, for example, like guns; and they
are @ useful commodity in fostering or reinforcing operational rela-
tionships. Not unexpectedly, officers of WE Division have a somavhat
different attitude tovent guns than do officers of, say, EUR Division.
Yet another attitude prevails in Fi Divielon aa a consequence of its
support of large-scale paramilitary operations in Southeast Asie.

We ahould af4 that FE Division uskes @ clear distinction betveen

District Attorney James Gorrieon's investigation of the supposed
Hew Orleans origin of a plot to assassinate President Kennedy tried
to link CIA to two incidents in eouthern Loulsiang involving caches
of weapons and explosives. The first incident occurred in 1961 and
concerned the theft of material from an explosives storage bunker at
the Houma Air Force Base at Houma, Louisiane. The second incident
was in July 1963 when the 7BI seized a cache of explosives and other
warerelated materials near Laconbe, Louisiana.

Garrison my have gotten these two incidents confused in the
early days of his investigation, thinking that the theft frou the
Houma bunker tock place not long before the assassination of President
Kemedy. It te elso possible that he deliberately merged the two
incidents to add sensation to his case. There may, in fact, be a
ink between the tvo incidents; the description of the materials
seized by the FBX at Lacoubo sounds suepiciously Like those reportedly
stolen from the Houma bunker.

In any event, a key element of Garrison's case ves an allegation
‘that one Julio BUZNEDO went to Dallas at the time of the sssassine~
tion 1n e panel truck used in the comitssion of the burglary of the

“portedly has a photograph showing BUZHEDO standing with FERRIE beside

of his lewyers, Stephen PLOTKIN, vas paid by CIA. NOVEL was poly=
@raphed by Lloyd FURR, o private detective in NeLean, Virginia. The
reference to Mclean caused newspapers to speculate that NOVEL had

the Schluuberger bunker in Houma at CIA's instigation end that he ran
‘the Evergreen Advertising Agency in New Orlesns as a CIA front. He
left @ letter in his New Orleans epartment, subsequently delivered
to Garrison, implying s tie between NOVEL and the CIA Double-Chek -
operation. ROVEL sent 4 telegram to the DCI on 28 Nay 1967 about

Trails to CIA from the Leccnve Munitions Cache and Training Camp
Alberto Federico FERNANDEZ Hechavarrias Albert FERNANDEZ was

named by Hichael LABORDZ as being his father's contact among Cuban
exiles. In a 1964 interview with the FAI, FERNANDEZ acknowledged
that he knew of Rudolph DAVIS, the Lacombe group's contact with
their American supporters. FERNANDEZ was s prominent member of the
UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA, vhich was CIA-supported. FERNANDEZ was also
& JHMAVE contact beginning in Decesber 1960 and contiming et
least through Jamery 1966. He figured in e 1962 IG investigation of
CIA activities in the Miant area as the owner of a ship, the TMJANA,
vhich was used by the Agency in maritime operations against Cubs.
Lawrence J. LABORDE: LABORDE was named ap one of those contact~

ing Frank BARTES in New Orleans to arrange for the training of the
Cubens at Leconbe. Larry LABCRDE was granted a provisional covert
security approval for use by the JMUAVE station on 24 March 1961. 4
31 March 1961 eable from Miami requested permission to increase his
salary to $700 yer month, plus bomuses. JMIAVE requested on 20
April 1962 thet the approval be cancelled on the grounds that LABORDE
was & poor security riske He served es chicf engineer on FERNANDEZ’
‘vessel, the TEJANA. LABORDE almost certainly was the source of the
Charges of C7A mismanagement of Cuben operations, which reached the
White House and were the basis of the IG investigation in Florida in
1962. On 11 May 1967, LABORDE telephoned the New Orleans office of

that Garrison would subpoena him, that he was willing to leave the
U.8. to avoid @ subpoena, and that he wanted the office to tell hin’
what to do. He was told that the New Orleans office was in no posi~
tion to advise him.

Victor Manuel PANECUE y BATISTA: Victor PANEQE was named by
Rudolph DAVIS e8 one of the Cubans who arrived at the Laconbe train~
ing coxp from Miami end vas identified by Carlos QJTROGA as being
the leader of the Cuban group. ‘The Miami station, on 10 August 1964,
requested @ POA and Commo clearance on PANEQUB as scon as possible.
the POA vas granted on 13 Noveuber 1964. The station reported on
5 October 1965 thet PANSQUE vas to be terminated os of 31 October
1965, because there was no immediate operational use for him.

Gerald P. REMMING: HEMNING was one of the men who approached
Frenk BARESS in Rev Orleans to propose the training activity at
Lacombe, end there is some evidence that puts him in charge of train-
ing et the camp. HEMMING hea denied sponsorship by any U.S. Governe
nent agency; however, there is information in the file indicating
that he may have been in touch with the Los Angeles DCB office at
one tine. A DDP/WH memorandum of February 1965 etated thet the
Clandestine Service had never hat eny operationel relationship with
HEMGNG. A 1964 cable from a WH Division covert operations office in
New Orleans xeported that HDMING's group had threatened to create a

acene to exbarvass CIA. ,
