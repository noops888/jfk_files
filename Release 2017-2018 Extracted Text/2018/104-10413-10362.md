MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence u

FROM ohn H. Waller oe Ch. .

Inspector General

SUBJECT : Bernard Fensterwalds dr. Comments in 22 October
1976 Issue of Washington Star

1. The following is a response to your query to Mr. Seymour Bolten
concerning comments made by Bernard Fensterwald, Jr.

2. The comments made by subject in the marked-section of the at~
tached newspaper clipping are partially factual and partially sheer
speculation. It is true that the Agency has been particularly sensitive
about the entire matter because the photographs in question originated
from a highly sensitive intelligence operation which was conducted in
October 1963 by the Agency and-Mexitan sécurity authorities against the
Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City. However, the material was
not withheld from the Warren Commission. It should be noted that Oswald
was in no sense “under investigation" and that at no time during his
stay in Mexico City did the CIA acquire a photograph of Oswald.

3. The Agency has 12 different photographs of an individual, pos-
sibly an American as yet unidentified, who was observed entering the
Soviet Embassy and later the Cuban Embassy. A cropped photograph was
introduced into the Warren Commission public record. The Warren Com-
mission and its Staff were made fully aware in the courss, of their
‘inquiry at Headquarters and in Mexico City of the origins of the photo-
graph, and the fact that we had additional photographs of the same
individual taken at different times in Mexico City. At one point our
Chief of Station in Mexico City suggested that the man in the photograph
was Oswald. However, this proved not.to be the case. It should be
noted that Mr. Fensterwald “in 1971-1972 was actually shown two of the
12 photographs during a visit to the Agency, other than the one already
published in the Warren Commission report. It is a matter of more than

ordinary interest to note that in April 1971 Mr. Fensterwald told Mr.
Lawrence Houston, the General Counsel at that time and another repre-
sentative of the Agency “in attendance at the mecting that he knew the
identity of the unidentified man in the photograph and that we will
be furnished his name in due course. tot
4. Al) coverage by CIA of Oswald's stay in Mexico City was tech-
nical. The Station had no live source coverage ei “wnilateral-or,
fir isong, Subsequently, Mexican police interrogated Sylvia ,
DURAN, a ‘an employee of the Cuban Embassy. . Her testimony gave us
full details on Oswald's trip to Mexcio City, and was made available
to the Warren Commission. The lack of coverage on Oswald entering the
Cuban or Soviet Embassies resulted from mechanical malfunction. The
Agency provided the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the field in
Mexico City and in Washington all of the information it had acquired.
