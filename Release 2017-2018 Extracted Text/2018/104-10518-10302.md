@ © LORAN EUGENE HALL, also known as

“The following information is submitted to re-
flect the activities of LORAN EUGENE HALL in the Miami
area.

On July 9, 1959, RUBEN MIRO GUARDIA, a Panamanian
then residing in Miami, advised that in April, 1959, he
was detained by Cuban Police in Havana, Cuba. During his
detention he met a United States citizen named LORAN HALL,
who was also under detention at the time. HALL, a white
male, approximately 30 years of age, 5'10" tall, black
hair, said he was from the State of Kansas, and had served
in the United States Armed Forces for about six years.

HALL told MIRO that he had arrived in Cuba in about March,
1959, and had subsequently been contacted by CAMILO
CIENFUEGOS, a Cuban Rebel Army Commander. CIENFUEGOS wanted
HALL to train a group of men who were goire to participate
in an invasion of Nicaragua. HALL claimed he trained a
group of men on a farm known as La Lisa, located near
Havana. HALL said the food for the trainees came from the
Cuban Military Stafff Headquarters, on the orders of
CYENFUEGOS. == :

MIRO stated that HALL said he was arrested on
April 8, 1959, by Cuban authorities, who alleged HALL was
suspected of being an FBI Agent. On MIRO's departure from
Cuba on July 7, 1959, HALL was still in the custody of
Cuban authorities but MIRO believed that HALL was going to
be released and deported to the United States.

‘LORAN EUGENE HALL

MM T-1, who has been involved in Cuban revolu-
tionary activities for the past years, advised on March
10, 1963, that HALL had been in Miami for about the past
three months, and associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING,
an American adventurer, mercenary and soldier of fortune.
MM T-1 stated HALL is disagreeable, is not Liked by the
other mercenaries in Miami, is of low moral character,
and appears to have a criminal background.

On March 18, 1963, LUIS BALBUENA, 908 S.W. Sth

Street, Miami, a Cuban exile, advised that his brother,
along with some Cubans and Americans, was involved in
some plan to try and overthrow the government of Haiti.
Sowehow connected with this group is an American, LORENZO

» @lso known as LAWRENCE HALL, a soldier of fortune,
who appears irresponsible and at one time was a member of
the Cuban Rebel Aroy..

On April 5, 1963, the Miami Office received a
telephone call from a LORENZO HALL, 142 S.W. 21st Avenue,
Apartment 6, Miami, Florida. HALL said he understood
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelli-
gence Agency and Immigration and Naturalization Service
were’ trying to locate him, and he wanted to report his
address.

On November 11, 1963, MM T-1 said that LORENZO
HALL, a white male, 25 years of age to 26 years, 5'7",

“155 pounds, ruddy c on, was unemployed and had in-
dicated that he was from Los Angeles,
Califo: - He is always on the move, is in and out of

Miami, is the confidence man type, and it was not know
if he was then in Miami. MM T-1 advised that HALL
claimed to have been in the Cuban Rebel Army, but the
other mercenaries in Miami doubt this. .

“LURAN EUGENE HALL

MM T-l said HALL was then loosely connected with
Cuban revolutionary activities, which he uses as a gimmick
to try and obtain money donations. In Miami, he loosely
associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, "MEXICAN" LARRY
HOWARD and WILLIAM HOUSTON SEYMOUR, all unemployed ad-
venturers. “

MM T-1 stated HALL and HOWARD made a trip to
California several months Previously in an attempt to
collect money by representing themselves as members of an
€anti-CASTRO movement. It is doubtful they collected any
sizeable amount of money. Their practice is to contact
local chapters of the John Birch Society, claiming they are
anti-Communist freedom fighters, and ask for money to carry
on their work. They do obtain some money this way, and
use the money for living expenses.

In October, 1963, according to MM T-1, HALL and
SEYMOUR visited Dallas, Texas, trying to collect money
donations under the guise of representing anti-CASTRO
organizations. Among the persons they contacted was
LESTER R. LOGUE, 628 Meadows Building, Dallas, a geolo-
gist. It is unknown if LOGUE gave them any money.

1 On December 5, 1963, MM T-1 advised that HALL
had not been seen around Miami for about a month, and his
whereabouts was then unknown.

On November 1, 1963 the United States Customs
Service, Miami, Florida, furnished a Yeport concerning the
boat PITUSA I, which was observed on October 29, 1963
being trailer hauled by a 1955 Oldsmobile sedan, south of
Miami in the direction of the Florida Keys. This car was

accompanied by another automobile, and a station wagon.
At approximately 1 AM on October 30, 1963, in the vicinity
of Jewfish Creek, U.S. Customs officers approached the
Oldsmobile and boat, and another one of the cars, and
found in the second car a quantity of arms, munitions,
explosives and supplies. The driver of the 1955 Olds-
wobile was identified as L. E, HALL, 142 S.W. 21st
Avenue, Miami, Florida, who was also the Tegistered ower
of this car. The sole occupant of the other car, a
Mercury, was identified as MANUEL BARBARITO PEREZ GOYANES ,
@ Cuban citizen. Customs seized both cars and their con-
tents.

Investigation disclosed that an anti-CASTRO or-
ganization, the Frente Revolucionario Anti-Commista
(FRAC), had been involved in Plans to utilize the PITUSA I
on a trip to Cuba, for the Purpose of gathering propaganda
material for the John Birch Society, and to obtain money
to sustain military type raids on Cuba.

EE On August 6, 1964, Mr. STANLEY SHACHTER, U.S.
Customs Agent, Miami, confirmed that L, E. HALL is identical
to LORAN EUGENE HALL. He recalled that HALL, at the time
of the Jewfish Creek incident, said he intended to to to
Cuba on a raid. Neither BALL nor his companions were
arrested.

At that time HALL had information in his poss-
ession reflecting that he was born January 4, 1930 and re-
sided at 285 N. Oakland, Apartment 9, Pasadena, California.
Another residence address in his possession was for 1191
Collegeview Drive, Apartment 14, Monterey Park, California.

On June 26, 1964, MM T-1 stated that he last

LORAN EUGENE HALL

heard of LORENZO HALL about 8 months ago, at which time
HALL was reportedly en route to Mexico with LAWRENCE
HOWARD. MM T-1 said that both HALL and HOWARD were
"“soldier-of-fortune types" and prior to coming to Miami
in 1963, had raised money, possibly from right wing
organizations in California, in order to support their
Proposed military action against the regime of FIDEL
CASTRO. HALL never succeeded in such military effort
in that he was thwarted by the action of U.S. Customs
at Miami, who seized what equipment he possessed.

M4 T-1 expressed the opinion that HALL may
have gone to Mexico with HOWARD, but HALL is not known
to have returned to Miami since the latter part of
1963.

E On July 22, 1964, GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, 1036
S.W. 5th Street, Miami, Florida, who since 1959 has
been active in Cuban revolutionary activities, stated
he first met LORAN HALL, who liked to be called "SKIP"
HALL, in April, 1959, at which time HALL was in jail at
the Army barracks in Ciudad Libertad near Havana, Cuba.
HALL was arrested for being involved in alleged prepara-
tions for revolutionary action against Nicaragua. BALL
shared a cell in the Cuban jail with SANTOS TRAFFI 7
well known gambler and hoodlum of Tampa and Miami,
Florida.

HEMING stated he next met HALL in Los Angeles
in January, 1963, at which time HEMMING was visiting
his family, and while in Los Angeles, HEMMING was inter-
viewed by a reporter from the PASADENA INDEPENDENT STAR
concerning HEMMING's anti-CASTRO organization called

Interpen (Inter-Continental Penetration Forces). HALL,
who was in California at the time, was able to locate
HEMMING through the reporter. ”

HEMMING related that on his return from Cali-
fornia to Miami in February, 1963, HALL accompanied
him, and after arrival in Miami, HALL attempted to asso-
clate himself with various anti-CASTRO groups to organize
action on several revolutionary ideas of HALL, including
one to invade Haiti. None of the groups at Miami took
HALL very seriously, considering him somewhat of an un-
reliable character.

HALL eventually associated himself with a
Cuban named MANUEL 'MANOLO" AGUILAR. Together with
AGUILAR and several other Americans, including WILLIAM.
SEYMOUR from Arizona and TOM DUNKIN, a Florida newspaper-
man, HALL participated in an infiltration attempt against
Cuba but they were arrested by U.S. Customs while still
on the highway in the Florida Keys. At that time U.S.
Customs confiscated what equipment the group had, but
mo prosecutions were brought against HALL or the other
individuals involved. HEMMING stated that the latter
incident occurred some time in late 1963.

During the summer of 1963, HALL and LAWRENCE
“LARRY" HOWARD, an individual of Mexican-American descent
who was in Miami at the time, went out to California
where they were able to raise funds and obtain some guns
which they then brought back to Miami. HEMMING recalled
that they had approximately 16 Garand M-l rifles, which
they converted to automatic rifles. HEMMING said that
these weapons were confiscated by U.S. Customs on the
highway in the Florida Keys when HALL and his group were
reportedly preparing to leave for Cuba.

LORAN EUGENE HALL

a HEMMING advised that HALL has not been in Miami
since approximately November, 1963 » When Customs made the
seizure of equipment. He said that HALL left Miami with
LAWRENCE HOWARD, who was reportedly now in Vera Cruz,
Mexico, HEMMING did not know if HALL went to Mexico at
that time but he recently saw MANUEL AGUILAR, now a
member of the anti-CASTRO group Ejercito Rebelde in Miami;
and AGUILAR said he had recently heard from HALL, who is
still in Los Angeles.

HEMMING stated that HALL is about 32 years of
age and is married to a woman who once was the secretary
to the President of Cessna Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas,
but as of February, 1963, when HEMMING was in Los Angeles,
HALL was residing at 285 N. Oakland, Apartment 9, Pasadena,
California. At that time he was employed by the Ernie
Porter Chevrolet Company in Pasadena.

HEMMING related that HALL and. LAWRENCE HOWARD
when en route from California to Miami in the summer of
1963 with the converted Garand rifles, were held by the
Dallas Police Department for possession of narcotic
medicines. HEYMING believed that HALL and HOWARD had
been able to obtain such medicines from doctors in Cali-
fornia on the basis of their Proposed military action
against Cuba, which would require medicine for the wounded.
HEMMING did not know how HALL and HOWARD came to the atten-
tion of the Dallas police.
