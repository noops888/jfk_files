division of powers and the beginnings of military integration

between the Central Government and the Katanga.

In those cireunstances, ve recommend three major steps:

1. M1lstary Stops to be Taken..

At the present time, our assessment is that, with the new

Indonesian battalion (one of then supposedly a paratrooper battalion)

and the relatively good security situation in the rest of the country.

the UN has enough ground forces to bandle any challonge from Katanganese

gendarmerle if it is not eballenged fron the air.

The problem 1s, therefore, to make sure that no present

or conceivablo Katanga air capability bas a chanco to operate against

the UN foroes. This means three thinee;

1., Changing the present rules of engugement of unoc

Air Force

•to permit the destruction in the

alr or on the ground of Katangese air force planes with combat

oapability, 1f any of these planes engages in a hostile act.

Tale mould involve due justification and publio warning bufore

such action was undertaken. Tshembe would be told that, 18 any

of his planos 1a positively identifiod as engaging in hostile

action in North Katanga or South Katanga, UNOC would consider

Itself justified not only in attacking the plane in question,

but In attacking and destroying on the ground, after due warning

so as to limit civilian casualtios, all Katangan air force

planes ilth combat capability.

2. Pollowing

on:all of the prosent arrangements

to beef up the UN air forces in the area with Swedish, Itallan,

Iranian, and Etbopian equipment and personnel..

3. Placing In the conse to back un the Ul fesses an

American fighter unit.

It would be a departure from the original Harmarsk jold polfey

for the United Nations-to accept an American unit as a part of the

regular UNOC Force, which has been made up of contributions from

countries uno are not pormanent members of the Security Council.

Moreover, It raises the question of the command relationship of the

Us unit to iOC. Under existing State-JCS arrangements the Usat

transport siroraft flying in support of UNOC, the CINCUR representative

in Leopolduille retains operational control. The Indian, Ethiopian

and Swedish air units are, of course, under direct UNoC command. The

SYC would find it easier to accept a US unit if Its command relation.

From the political standpoint, we belleve tais would be in the us

interest, but the views of the Secretary of Defense and the JCs

should be sought on this point.
