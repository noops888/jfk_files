C/S Comments: -

p Detziled policy: guidance for bonus payments to al! Cubans.

** WAVE(2) authorized to fund AMTIKI/1(4) locally $ 75,000, Also authorized
to make June payments to dependents of Freedom Fighters, Decision on July and
subsequent dependent payments would be a matter of high level policy,

*** July payments to be made only to dependents of strike force personnel
captured or missing,
648 Cutback in payments would inevitably carry grave political consequences,
WAVE(2) urged continuation at least long enough to allow 30 days notice to those

slated for cut off,
