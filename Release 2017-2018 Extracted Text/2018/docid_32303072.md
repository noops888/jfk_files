is being set forth herewith:

VERIFICATION OF THE STATUS OF MIKE GENOVESE AS A MAJOR

FIGURE.

Investigation in the Pittsburgh vicinity subsequent to the

meeting of hoodlums at Apalachin, New York, on 11/14/57

has established the fact that GENOVESE"'is a major figure

as far as the Pittsburgh racketeering element is concerned.

His association with racket figures in the vicinity of

Apalachin during November, 1957; has received widespread

publicity in Pittsburgh newspapers.

GEORGE "MOON" MESSER, a potential criminal informant of the

Pittsburgh Office who is intimately acquainted with many

Pittsburgh top hoodlums through association with them when

partner in a coin machine business in Pittsburgh, advised

PA

SA ROBERT A. VOEGE on 2/27/58 that in his opinion LA ROCCA

is "head. of the entire racket set-up in Western Pennsylvania"

and that the MANNARINO brothers of New Kensington, Pa., are

"probably just below him" in stature.

He stated that he

has no doubt that LA ROCCA 1s grooming MIKE GENOVESE for

this lofty racket position so that he may take it over following

the retirement of LA ROCCA.

PG 92-211

Continuing liaison with the police departments of Richland and

West Deer Townships, which cover the neighborhood surrounding

the GENOVESE residence at Gibsonia, Pa., has reflected that

no new Information concerning GENOVESE has been developed.

The Pittsburgh Office 1s presently

Its major hoodlum investigation in reviewing and re-evaluating

an effort to ascertain

the actual financial holdings of this subject.

Constant

checks are being made in this regard, keeping in mind that an

estimate of the net worth of a major

hoodlum such as MIKE

GENOVESE, based upon his scale of living, will be invaluable

not only for uncovering heretofore unknown sums of money,

but for dissemination to the local office, of the Internal

Revenue Service as an aid to that agency's investigative

efforts. This information will be evaluated for comparison

with the suggested agenda of the Apalachin meeting to

determine whether the transactions are in any way coincidental.

There has been no new information coming to the attention of

Pittsburgh agents, through informants or sources, which would

indicate that the Apalachin meeting was held for anything other

than those

purposes listed under Section E of referenced

Albany airtel.

It is to be noted that Pittsburgh Informant PG 514-C advised

on 11/25/57 that he had received information from one PAIXIIANI, who

had obtained it that

same day from MIKE GENOVESE, that

at the meeting it was agreed to build a string of motels across

the country and local representatives of the group were to

begin construction in their territories. The group at

Apalachin would be called upon for any financial aid needed

in this regard.

At this same time GENOVESE reportedly advised

TIANI that he and his partner, ARCHIE NELSON, also a Pittsburgh

top hoodlum, had plans to build a motel at Monroeville, Pa.

MIKE GENOVESE was contacted by SA ROBERT A. VOEGE on 5/29/58 - 3

at which time he advised that inasmuch as he had little

education compared to that of a FBI Agent he would consent to

an Interview only int the presence of hisshook up" over the

VINCENT CASEY

of Pittsburgh. He admitted that he was

investigation which has centered around him to date and he

does not believe he has done anything wrong to warrant such

an investigation.

He admitted that he was at Apalachin,

New York, on 11/14/57, but stated he "didn't know what it

was all about.

He said that he wishes now he had never been
