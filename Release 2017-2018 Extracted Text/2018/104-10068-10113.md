1. In revlewing the traffic for the period indicated. Rowton fuzzé

valuavie confirmation of LIRING/3 and IIRING/4 contact with Ram=e

Abrou, Indicating that both persons complied with Rowton's suggertions.

LIRING/3'a telephonic contacts with Enrique Morales In Guatemala City

confirmed reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the eve=-.

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 18 a dinner engize

ment which Enrique Morales had in Guetemala City on 25/4/67 wits "friends"

of Morales' wife, Esperanza. SAN-10 (17.5) a1s0 reveals that I5=G/3

and fiorales are engaged in sone sort of deal for the purchase of purses

or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatenala or San Cristóbal for resale

1n Mexico City or import into the U.s. at a bigher price. (LIPI=/3

mentioned the opportunities in this line to Rowton previously, It RoW

ton did not react favorably)

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of to take

which will serve to clarify them is relationship to reports made to him

by LIRING/3 and IIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Ramiro Abrey: On 22/4/67, shortly after lowton

suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect torough

him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephazed the

Embassy and attampted to reach Abreu. From. the content and toe of ber

questions and renarks; it appears obvious that IIRINC/4 hes not bad re-

cent contact with the Cuban mission. She asks when Abreu is Leaving for.

Havana, but is given no information. She tries again at abort 1900 and

2000, but there is no answer. She finalli sets througo to abrez on

14-13-26 who promises to come to her home between 1000 and 1100 the

following day (23/4/67). She has to give Abreu the address, indicaiing

that be 1s not faulliar with the bone add-ess of LIRING/3 or/s.

SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that ibreu called or talked to 1-ING/4

yun the telephone three times on 24/4/67. ITRNG/4 makes reference to

"so much analysis, so many theories and ideas" which apparentiy were dis-

cussed between her and Abreu at their 23/4/67 conversation. her re

maris made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu indicate that Abreu 1s, or watra

1s substance by LIRIlG/3, although Rowton has not as yet had a chance

to talk directly with IIRING/4 to get her version of the conversationa

with Abreu. Apparently in ordes to put Abreu off (in his amorous de-

81508) LIPIIiG/4 teals him on 25/4/67 that her husband auspects.

sonething is going on between bem. In reply to Abreu's anxious ques

tioning, LIRING/4 states that her huswand asked her whether she liked

Abreu and whether Abreu like her, to which she said that the replied is

the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off.

without ali.nating hin). Abrew's visit to the apartment and his pro-

poed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confinned by the latter in his

report to Rowton on 27/4/67•

Conversativns Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) IIRIG/3 asks

his (Guatemalan friend (Jacobo jodriguez Padilla?) Whether It mattern 1?

the hath certificate la for a person 10 years older? Jacobo replied

in the negative, but would prefer it of a persos ten years younger.II-.

RDiG/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his posuossion by

2526/4/57. Inis is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state

ment made to him some tro weeks previoualy that when he wont to pick us

the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of bis

half-brother (and the lawyer Folando Riojas) he discoverid that it was

Ior a person born in 1916 and hence useless for himseli. MIRiNG/3 also.

reported to Rowton that Jacobp had contacted him recently and asked for

hoip in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation

therefore would indicate that IIRING/3 plans to sive Jacobo the false

document originally procured for himself through his half-brother. II-

RING/3, bowever, has not revealed this plan to porton.

SAI-11 (16.0) reveals that IIRING/3 informed his brothar two days later

that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but it 1a "impossible

to get the birth certificate. The book no longer eximstt." He adds that

he has written his half-brother a lotter explaining everything: LIRIlG/5

reportod to Rowton that he had asked his balf-brother to obtain an

"acta notorial" in lieu of brita certificate and hoped to have the doce

ment soon.

LIPING/3 reported that he had been working with the Secretarait of

Commerce and Industry to obtainthe license for the importation of the

and that be had told Enrique Morales Guerra to stand

by until the forrelities of the license were completed. He added that

as a wetter of fact he had not made any commitment to Morales and did

not feel under any obligation to continue to use him, even in the

business, especially If Roston had any further reservations about him.

?. Regarding

Sergio Gonzalez Marin of the Secretariat of

Commerce and Industry, LIRING/3 co:mented that, as he had reported pre-

viously to Rowtor, the latter had formerly been a member of the Communist

Party of Mexico, but was no longer active. LIRING/3 added that his sis-

Corcalon Marin; was a very active nember of the

Party and narried tol a Raúl moreno, who was also most probably a ember

of the Communist Party. IT-ING/3 continued that both Raúl koreno and

Silva and

had & mutual friend Sergic Valdez who had

excellent contacts in extreme leftist circles. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez was the son of the Siempre correspondent and associate of Alberto

9 or 10 May, Roxton stated to him at the end of the meeting that he was

preparing a nunber of questions that still bothered bin so that LIRING/3

could sive a definitive reply that would close the matter for once and

might havo and hoped that this would resolve any problem and dispell any

lingering doubts that Ronton
