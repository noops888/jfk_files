known to this Station, Station files also contain references
to a Sergio Valdez (who may or may ot be identical with the

National Coamittee of the SMACP, Mexican Society of Friendship
with People's China. .

iaentical with the man by t'e same name who contacts Gerard
Pierre Charles. We will also try to identiiy the alleged: PAR.

: Subject: Analysis of LIFEAT Traffic Relating to LIEING/3 for ?
the Period 19-26 April,1967.

1. In reviewing the traffic for the period indicated Zowton fomdé
Valuable confirmation of LIRING/3 and LIRING/4 contact wath Ramiro
Abreu, indicating that both persons complied with.Rowton's suggessions.
LIRIKG/3's telephonic contacts. with Enrique Morales in Guatemale City
confirmed reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the ev
The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 is a dinner engeze-

ment which Enrique Norales had in Guatemala City on 25/4/67 with "friends" 7
of Morales' wife, Esperanza. SAN-10 (17.5) also reveals that LIz=uG/3

end Morales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of 5 ‘parses

or briefcases (boisas) « either in ‘Guatenala or San Cristébal for sesale

in Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIBT2/3
mentioned the opportunities in this line-to Rowton previously, <3 Row-

ton did not. react favorably).

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of tie take
which will serve to clarify them in relationship to reports made to him
by LIRING/3 and LIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Ramiro Abreu: On 22/8/67, shortly after 2owton
suggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect zarovgh

him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephszed the
Embassy and attmmpted to reach Abreu. From the content and tone cf her
questions and remarks, it appears obvious thet LIRTNG/4& has act had re-
cent contact with the Cuban mission. She asks.when Abreu is leaving for
Havana, but is given no information. She. tries sgain at abozt 1900 and
2000, but there is no answer. She finally gets througa to Abrez on
44-13-26 who promises to come to her home jbetween 1C00 and 1460 the
following day (23/4/67). She has to give Abreu the address, indicaving
that he is not fawiliar with the hone eddzess of LIRING/3 or/s.
SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that Abreu called or talked to EXaHIG/4
>on the telephone “three times on: 2k/4/67. LIRNG/4 makes referezce to
val : "go much analysis,so many theories and ideas" which apparentiy were dis
W cussed between her and Abreu at their 23/4/67 conversation. ckher re-~
marks made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu indicate that Abreu is, or watna
to become emotionally involved: with LIRING/4, who at least ‘im words ap"

Hf od pears to have encouraged him, TERS a were reported to Rowton

in substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet had a chance
to talk directly with LIRING/4 to get her version of the conversations
with Abreu. Apparently in order to put Abreu off (in bis ‘amomous de-
signa) LIRIKG/4 tebls him on 25/4/67 that her husband suspects. that
sonething is going on between them. In reply to Abreu's enxious ques-
tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husvand asked her whethor she liked
Abreu and whether Abreu like her, to which she said that the replied in
the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off
without alisnating him). Abreu's visit to the apartment’ and bis pro-
peed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confimmed by the latter in his
report to Rowton on 27/4/67.

Coaversaticns Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) LIRING/3 asks
bis(Guatemalen friend (Jacobo icdriguez Padilla?) whether it matters ir
the hin fignte 4s for a person 10 years older? Jacobo revlied
in the negative, but would prefer it of a person ten years younger.LI-

' REIG/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his possession by

25~26/4/57. This is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state-
ment made to him some two weeks previously that when he wont to pick up
the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of his
half-brother (and the lawyer Rolendo Riojas) he discoversd that it was
Yor a person born in 1916 and hence useless for himself. LIKIKG/3 also
reported to Rowton that:Jacobp had contacted him recently and asked for
help in obtaining false’ papers for himself. The above conversation
therefore would indicate that LIRING/3 plana to give ‘Jacobo. the false
document originally procured for himself through bis half-brother. Li-
RING/3, however, has not revealed this plan to Rowton.

SAN-11 (16.0) reveals that LIAiNG/3 informed his brother two days later
that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but it is "impossible
to get the birth certificate. The book no longer exizsts." He adds thet
he has written his half-brother a letter explaining everything. LIRING/3
reported to Rowton that he had asked his half-brother to obtain an
“acta notorial" in lieu of ‘rita certificate and hoped to have the doca-
ment soon. '

4. In preparation for a possible LCFLUTTER examination of LIRING/3 on
9 or 10 Hay, Rowton stated to him at the end of the meeting that he was

coulé give a definitive reply that would close the matter for once and
all. LIRING/3 replied. that he was anxious to answer any questions Rowton
might have and hoped that ‘this would resolve any problem and dispell eng
lingering doubts ‘that Rowton mizht still have concerning his bona fides.
