Statement of Raymond H. Rosing regarding audit of Sidney Morris

Peck based on telephone interview 8/13/15.

In the summer of 1968 I was the Assistant Chief of the Audit Division

in the Cleveland District. I recall some of the circumstances

surrounding the audit of Sidney Morris Peck; though I would like

to review the audit file (which has not yet been received from the

Federal Records Center) before giving any formal testimony on the

subject if any should be necessary.

My best recollection is that the return was of a type which would

identified by the computer as having audit pitiahal.

not normally be setected for audit. The information on the return

was-not of the kind which the computer would normally select for

audit under the IRs DIF scoring method. There was no routine

procedure in effect at that time for manual screening of returns

for questionable deductions. Therefore, without some impetus

from outside the normal, routine system, Mr. Feck's return

would in all probability not have been selected for review.

My best recollection is that at the time of the demonstrations

by the SDS in Chicago in 1968, or shortly thereafter, we received

in Cleveland a transmission from the National Office with regard

to pulling Mr. Peck's tax return. My impression (though I am

by no means certain) is that Mr. Peck was one of a number of

people on a National Office list of persons associated with the SDS,

HW 50955 DocId:32423538 Page 16

## Page 17

= 2 -

and that the transmission was the impetus for our pulling Mr.

Peck's return for review. I do not now recall whether there

were other names of other persons associated with SDS on the

transmission to the Cleveland District or whether Mr. Peck

was the only one.

I have been advised that Inspector Samuel Gardner has indicated

he orally transmitted to the Audit Department some information

regarding improper deductions by Mr. Peck which he obtained

from the FBI. I have no recollection of this event, though it

could very easily have occurred as Inspection frequently :

supplies information to Audit.

Upon manual review of Mr. Peck's tax return, it was noticed

that there were a number of deductions which were not self-

explanatory and which required audit, so an audit was conducted.

I have no recollection that there was any special urgency about

the audit, or that Mr. Peck was treated differently from any

other taxpayer. In fact, I was quite certain the audit was conducted

in an entirely routine manner.

Mr. Frederick A. O. Schwartz, Jr.

General Counsel

United States Senate

Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations

with Respect to Intelligence Activities

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Schwartz:

As requested in your letter of 6 August 1975, and passed by

telephone to Mr. Gregory Treverton this date, the

following

replies are provided:

1..

During the period September 15 to November 3, 1970, I was

serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Were you aware at this time that President Nixon had

requested the CIA to conduct certain activities in Chile

directed toward preventing Salvadore Allende from assuming

the Presidency?

Answer: My knowledge concerning the CIA activities in

Chile was restricted to that information that was discussed

in formal meetings of the 40 Committee. The main thrust of

these meetings was pointed toward various financial actions

aimed at assisting the established political opposition to

Allende. I did not attend the last staff meeting in the

White House on the subject of Chile but was represented by

Lt. Gen. Richard Knowles, U.S. Army. Neither did I attend

the National Security Council meeting on the subject in

November 1970. In this case I was represented by General

William Westmoreland, U.S. Army.

2.

Were you aware that these activities included an attempt. by

CIA and DIA officers in Chile to promote a military coup

d'etat by opponents of Salvadore Allende?

Answer: I was not aware that an active effort was underway

to promote a military coup by opponents of Salvadore

Allende. Speculation as to the possibility of independent

action on the-part of the Chilean military forces, who were

known to be strict constitutionalists, was of course raised

from time to time during discussions of the rapidly

developing Allende episode. As I recall, I was advised

by General Bennett, Director of the Defense Intelligence

Agency, on one occasion that the DIA was in touch with our

attaches in Chile with a view toward determining the

courses of action, if any, which might be under considera-.

tion by the Chilean military.

This was prior to Allende's

inauguration. General Bennett noted that the contacts.

and friendships developed by the attaches with the

Chilean officers while assigned to the Inter-American

Defense College and the Inter-American Defense Board

were expected to be of assistance.

Did you hear during this time any reference to a two-track

policy aimed at preventing Allende's accession to office?

•Specifically, did you ever hear of a so-called Track II?

Answer: I did not hear any reference to a "Two-Track" policy

aimed at preventing Allende's accession to office at that

time (1970). I learned of the so-called "Track II" policy

only a few days ago (1975).

Did you know at the time that any weapons had been passed

to Chilean conspirators by the Central Intelligence Agency

during the September to October 1970 period?

Answer: I was not aware at that time that weapons were being

passed to Chilean conspirators by the CIA.

Were you aware of any activities being conducted in Chile

during this time that had not been taken up by the 40 Com-

mittee, either for informational or approval purposes?

Answer: As stated before, the answer is "No."

Did you ever learn, subsequent to November 3, 1970, of U.S.

efforts to promote a coup d'etat in Chile, a two-track

policy regarding Chile, weapons passed to Chilean conspirators,

or activities being conducted in Chile during this period

that were not reported to or approved by the 40 Committee?

If so, when did you learn of these activities? Through what

source did you learn of these activities? What specifically

did you learn of these activities?

Answer: As stated before, I learned of subject activities

only a few days ago when I was advised that considerable

information had been requested of the Secretary of Defense

by the "Select Committee," and that a thorough search of the

files of the Joint Staff was being conducted concerning the

subject of Chile. I was given this information by General

George Brown, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who did

discuss the matter with the Secretary of Defense following

Dr. Schlesinger's telephone conversation with Chairman Frank

Church. With respect to the activities generated by the

"Two-Track"' policy, I was advised at this time that there

was in fact à "Two-Track" policy and that communications

were passed between Washington and Santiago with respect to

action by Chilean military officers aimed at preventing

Allende from seizing power prior to the time he was actually

inaugurated. In this connection I should report that so far

as I know there are no references in the Joint Chiefs' files

to the "Two-Track"' policy and 1 have personally never seen

any messages, incoming or outgoing,

dealing with "Track II."

Hence, I have no knowledge of the details of the events

alleged to have occurred by the New York Times articie you

supplied.

While the above sets forth my best recollection concerning

the Allende episode, I will of course be. happy to answer further

questions if you so desire.

Dear Mr. Miller:

This Agency is unable to locate a document described

as "Review Conducted in Mid-1969 by Chief, Special Opera-

tions Division, on Covert Disruptive Action."

This refers

to your request dated 31 July 1975 (Covert Action, Laos,

First Priority, Item 22).

It is possible that the so-called review was an up-

dating of the manual listed as Item 18 in referenced

request,

"CA/PMG paper on Covert Disruptive Action

Operational Guidance (Paramilitary Countersubversive

Operations), early 1962.

In any event, if the Committee staff could provide

us with any further clarification of its request, this

would assist greatly in continuing the search.

Butterfield receiving any money from CIA.

2. The Agency has no knowledge of any

agent whose employment with

the Agency was un-

known to the White House and who was assigned

to the White House.

3. Each Agency in the Intelligence

a penetration of the White House, and the

response in each case was negative.

The response from each Agency in the

Intelligence Community was also negative with

respect to access to the White House tapes.

5.

Personnel in the Technical Security

Dear B111:

Re your letter of July 30th, I am hard pressed just

now and

can only be summary: • !

1.

created by

to it by Congress.

The Act of 1947 does not authorize

use of force or hostile acts.

2. The Executive has no independent authority

to authorize hostile acts. My views on that were

compressed in an article in the

NoY.Times

re Mayaguez,

which you will find In Cong. Reç., June 2,1975,

52772.

3.: There is no inherent authority over foreign

affairs. Madison made clear that such authority had

to be "given"

, and except for authority to receive

ambassadors It wis made subject to advice and consent

of the Senate. You will find a full length discussion

of this in Chapter V of my Executive Privilge.

4. Congress must come

to grips with the fact that, as

President Buchanan said, the President can not fire a

hostile shot, even for the protection of Americans, without

congressional authorization.

A11 good wishes,

Yours in haste

In reference to the Committee request of 16 July 1975, I noted

that item D. 6. (1960 DCI-BOB Defense Study of Intelligence) was

previously requested. This document is, and has been since early

May, located in your study area here at CIA Headquarters. Its full

title is 'Joint Study Group Report on Foreign Intelligence Activities."

The clearance that we obtained from the White House concerning

this document specified that it was to be made available for review

here. If you are now requesting delivery to your offices, then it

would be best if you went directly to the White House since the DCI does

not have authority to transmit it.. I hope that

you will find the existing

access satisfactory, however.

During the course of recent testimony before the

the following question:

What were Taylor Branch's connections

with CIA?

Dear Mr. Miller:

Attached are two additional communications (CIA

messages SANTIAGO 4553 dated 12 January 1971 and DIRECTOR

103882 dated 21 January 1971) exchanged between Colonel

Wimert and General Bennett on

the events in Chile during

the latter part of 1970.

Also attached is a covering note to General Bennett

from William

Broe,

then Chief of the CIA Western Hemi-

sphere Division.

This covering note also contains an

original handwritten acknowledgment from General Philpott

to Mr. Broe.

While these messages were exchanged more than two

months after the event, they are possibly of current interest

because they concern the General Schneider incident.

Intelligence A

tivities

Dear B111:

Re your letter of July 30th, I am hard pressed just

now and can only be summary:

created by

National Security Council is an agency

ongress, and it has only the powers delegated

to it by Congress.

The Act of 1947 does not authorize

use of

force or hostile

acts.

2. The Executive has no independent authority

to authorize hostile acts. My views

on that were

compressed in an article in the N.Y.Iimes re Mayaguez,

which you will find in Cong. Rec., June 2,1975,

E2772.

3. There is no inherent authority over foreign

affairs. Madison made clear that such authority had

to be

"given"

, and except for authority to receive

ambassadors 1t was made subject to advice and consent

of the

Senate. You will find a full length discussion

of this in Chapter V of my Executive Privilge.

4. Congress must come to grips with the fact that, as

President Buchanan said, the President can not fire a

hostile shot, even for the protection of Americans, without

congressional authorization.

All good Wishes,

Yours in haste

Dear Mr. Schwarz:

We are in receipt of your letter dated July 30, 1975 wherein you

request the cooperation of the City of Miami Police Department

in your investigation of the relationships between federal agencies

and local public departments throughout the United States.

While we welcome the opportunity to cooperate with your committee,

it is our feeling that your request covers an extremely broad

range of information, too broad in fact for our department to

adequately fulfill without incurring a prohibitive amount of

expense.

Our legal advisors have been consulted with reference

to your request and they also have some reservations about

approving the release of much of this information in light of

the recently enacted Federal Privacy Regulations (see Federal

Register Vol. 40, No. 98 - Tuesday,

May 20, 1975)•

We would appreciate more specific guidelines with reference to

the information you have requested and would suggest that you

coordinate your work through our legal advisors Ms. Loraine Strait

and Mr. Thomas Connors.

Mr. William G. Miller, Staff Director

Mr. Frederick A.0. Schwartz, Jr., Chief Counsel

United States Senate

Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations

With Respect to Intelligence Activities

Washington, D.C. 20510

Gentlemen:

I have your inquiry of July 30 pertaining to constitutional

issues regarding foreign covert action operations.

As I told

Robert Kelley of your staff on the telephone, I unfortunately

cannot take time now to pursue at length the interesting and

Permit me simply to sketch my

conclusions.

You raise two broad questions of special interest to me:

first, the President's authority to permit the conduct of

loreign covert actions in the absence of statutory authoriza

tion; second, congressional power to regulate the conduct oI

covert actions in view of the President's constitutional powers.

It seems to me that the first of these questions is the

more complex but also the less

may be made, as you know, that! in the absence of statutory

authorization, the President has some authority derived from

his concerns with foreign affairs and military matters.

believe that the maximum executive authority in this regard

best viewed in accordance with the three-part division suggested

by Justice Jackson's concurring opinion in the Steel Seizure

Justice Jackson's second category

in his Steel Seizure analysis seems especially relevant here:

there may

•be situations where a President may be able to act

because of "a zone of twilight" -- an area in which there is room

for initiative by either branch, and in which the executive may

act in the absence of contrary congressional directions.

believe that presidential authority in the foreign covert intel-

ligence area stems largely from congressional inaction or perhaps

implied authorization rather than from any inherent, congres-

sionally untouchable variety of presidential power.

-2--

But it seems to me that pursuit of the question of the per-

missible range of executive authority in the absence of congres-

sional action is relevant largely to matters of hindsight, and

that the more important question pertains to the future.

The

latter question - the question of whether Congress has power to

act, to set guidelines, impose restrictions, and exercise over-

sight - seems

to me the simpler as well as the more important

one.

Congressional power to enact the kind of measures proposed

in recent discussions seems to me clear - even clearer,.

for

example, than the authority to adopt the War Powers Resolution

of 1973. Congress, it should be recalled, not only has autho-

rity to adopt measures necessary and proper to implement consti-

tutionally granted legislative powers, but also, under the quite

explicit terms of the Necessary and Proper Clause, may "make

all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into

execution" "all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the

Government of the United States, or in any Department or Office

thereof."

In short, even if the

executive branch can assert a

"twilight zone" authority to conduct covert foreign intelligence

operations in the absence of congressional action, any execu

tive authority in that area is subject to the congressional

oversight and guidelines founded on Art. I, 58, cl. 18 of. the

Constitution.

In short, I would think that the major congressional focus

in the important task that you are presently undertaking should

be on the question of what measures are appropriate by way of

congressional control. That, I recognize, is a difficult task;

but it is a task which can and should be undertaken with very

great confidence that Congress has the authority to enact what-

ever it may ultimately find to be appropriate as a matter of

wise national policy.

With high regard,

Faithfully yours,

Gerald Gunther

SELECT COMMOTEE ON

INTELLICENCE ACTIVITIES

Columbia University

New York, New York,

August 6, 1975

10027

Dear Mc. Miller:

Your letter of July 30 invites my views as to the constitutional

authority of the President to conduct "covert action operations."

Since the Constitution does not speak to this subject, and the

Supreme Court has given no opinion on it, I cannot, of course, be highly

confident in my views, but the following is my considered opinion in brief

outline:

1. Although the Constitution does not expressly confer

the power to conduct covert operations on the Federal

Government, I have no doubt that, as a matter of

Constitutional Law, the Federal Government has the

authority to conduct such operations equally with

other soverign nations.

Compare U.S. Curtiss-Wright

Export .Corp.,

299 U.S. 304 (1936). Clearly, then,

the President may carry out such operations when

authorized by Congress.

2. If Congress has not forbidden or otherwise reg-

ulated the conduct of such operations, the President,

it can respectably be argued, may conduct such opera-

tions on his own authority. By international practice

such operations, like espionage, appear to be an

accepted facet of the conduct of foreign relations

which is the President's responsibility under his

"Foreign Affairs Powers. If so, he can carry them out

by all means available to him, including the use of

military personnel under his command, in ways short

See Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the Constitutio

(1972)

pp. 45-54 and corresponding notes. That such

activities may violate international law, or treaties

to which the United States is party, would be consti-

tutionally irmaterial: the Constitution does not

forbid the President (or Congress) to violate our

international obligations; and the President may do

what is within his constitutional authority even if

what he does violates international law.

3. I am, however, disposed to the view that Congress

can forbid, regulate, oversee or scrutinize, such

Executive actions, at least when gross intervention

in the affairs of other nations, especially with the

use of troops, might invite war, since decisions about,

or close to, war-and-peace are for Congress to make.

If so, Congress can regulate such activities either

directly by legislation, or by denying or limiting

appropriations for such purposes.

Need I say that nothing above implies my support or approval for

such activities as a citizen, whether conducted with or without Congressional

authorization?

conducting the defense of this litigation, it appears that you should

review the Select Commitice's request and determine what further

material, if any, should be provided to the Committee.

As you may know, in response to earlier questions raised orally by

staff members of the Select Committee, copies of all documents filed i

in Court by both sides to this litigation - with the exception of an

in-camera submission o defendants -- were provided to the Committee.

In addition, the staff members were advised, after consultation with

your department, that questions regarding patterns and practices, both '

past and present, wouid be answeied by the Aimy, but that specific

names, dates, and places could not be discussed at this stage of the

litigation, snile we are awaiting a hearing on the defendants' renewed!

motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The:

Army, of course, desires that this motion be heard as soon as the Court'e

schedule perinite.

Considering all of the circumstances -- including the obvioua practical

difficulties inherent in cuplicate consideration of these mattera by two

'forums, and protection of the rights of those defendants sued, in their

personal capacity:-- I believe that we should await the Court's ruling'

'on the motion before we provide the Commitice with specific information

regarding the specific individuals and issues involved in this litigation.

Following the Court's ruling, we would then make an appropriate

determination as to the Committce's rcquest.

Dear Mr. Miller:

In response to your requests (originally on 26 June

1975 and again on 31 July 1975) for information about

Agency relations with a number of corporations, please be

advised that we have available a list of contracts with

ITT, Hughes,

and the Wachenhut Corporation.

k

Because of the sheer bulk of the information, we

recommend that appropriate members of

the Senate Select

Committee staff meet with representatives from our Office

of Logistics and review the listing which states the value

of the contract, starting and stopping dates, and a brief

description of the scope of the work.

After

this review,

specific contracts can be made

available.

We have no information about contractual activity

involving International Intelligence Inc., Dector Corpora-

tion, Pan American Airways, or US R&D Corporation, although

we have not completed our

review of contract activity in

highly-compartmented programs.

Dear Mr. Schwarz:

individuals who engage in gatherina of intelligence,

s incredible. 1 think that the elected politicians

in Washington who are supposed to represent their states

are doing

a pretty good job of raping the FBl, the ClA,

and the

DEA.

1n15, however, involves incest because

they are federal agencies.: I suppose if members of

Congress decide

to destroy the effectiveness of

the

FBI, the CIA, the DEA, and

the military

that this is

their prerogative as long as their constituents holo

still.

The attemot to penetrate the appropriate criminal

intelligence mechanisms of local government by federal

lawmakers is an absolute violation of the Tenth Amend-

ment of the constitution.

It will be a cold dav in

hell when I provide you with the information you have

requested.

didn't gather necessary intelligence information

on criminal

activity in my city to assist me in

ing my resources at the right place at the right time,

this city would be in the same shape as many others.

We are proud of the fact that when crime went up

nationally 26 percent between 1970 and 1974, crime went

down in this city almost five percent.

One of the

prime reasons is appropriate intelligence operations.

We are proud of the fact that this is the only major

city in the country relatively free of any organized

crime influence--that is because of appropriate

intelligence gathering functions.

We are proud of the

fact that terrorists don't intimidate the citizens of

our city--that is largely due to appropriate intelli-

gence gathering processes.

Our intelligence gathering is in absolute conformance

with California law and is done under quidelines set

forth by our civilian Board of Police Commissioners.

I would suggest that you stick your nose back in your

own tent.

Dear Mr. Schwarz:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter ad-

dressed to Commissioner Pomerleau, Police Commissioner of

Baltimore City, dated July 30, 1975, requesting information

regarding intelligence activities of the Baltimore City Police

Department between federal agencies and other information

related thereto.. I am, by special designation, specially

as a result of a declared conflict of interest of the Attorney

General of Maryland.

The Baltimore City Police Department,

while funded by the City of Baltimore, is a State agency.

This is one of many unique features of this agency.

Your Committee should be informed that federal monies

have not been used by the Baltimore City Police Department in

any way to support intelligence gathering activities.

This

means that no federal money has been used for the payment of

personnel involved in the gathering of intelligence information,

for the purchase of equipment related to intelligence gathering,

or payment to sources for information related to intelligence

matters.

The Baltimore City Police Department has been inves-

tigated by almost every agency in government, except your com-

mittee.

By way of illustration, it was the subject matter of

an extensive and all inclusive investigation by two Baltimore

City Grand Juries in which

the Department fully cooperated

without the requirement of

subpoena, and after this investi-

gation which, in my judgment, 'was conducted in part by indi-

viduals who were something less than neutral in their bias

against the Police Department.

Department against the State Senate Investigating Committee,

a. Does the State Senate Committee have

authority to be other than a legislative

body? i.e., Does it have inquisitorial

or accusatorial powers?

b.

Is the Committee conducting its investiga-

Dear Mr. Miller:

I was delighted to learn that you will be able to speak at The

National War College on Thursday, 18 September, at 1:30 p.m.,

to those of our students taking the elective course

"Intelligence

and National Security," addressing the topic "Intelligence Con-

straints in a Democratic Society:

The Congressional Perspective."

This seminar, the opening session for the second bloc of the course,

will be the students'

principal exposure to the ethical and legal

limits for intelligence activities of our democracy.

As background,

the students will have read the summary of the Rockefeller Commission

Report and will have been encouraged to keep abreast of developments

in the press. Beyond this, we would benefit in particular from your

insights on impending or likely legislation, the key themes of the

ongoing hearings, and the quality of the public debate.

The session

following yours

collectors to discuss many of the same basic issues from their

perspective.

Perhaps you would lead off with 40-50 minutes of initial remarks.

Following a short break, the group will reconvene for questions

and

answers for the balance of the two hours.

The National War College has a well-established policy of holding

all remarks in presentations such as yours in strictest confidence.

This, we believe, permits the speaker to discuss his subject freely

and with complete candor.

SSC-CIA PROCEDURES

Procedures for the continuing investigation of the

Agency by the

Senate Select Committee are agreed along

the following lines:

1.

The Director reaffirms his responsibility to

protect sensitive sources and methods.

As a general

practice,

Agency files will be screened before the SSC

is granted access. The primary purpose is to protect

sensitive names and methods.

2. The SSC reaffirms its need to have access to complete

unscreened files.

In practice, the SSC staff has the

right to protest our removal of information. CIA

must be precise when

material is removed and explain

why.

The SSC staff in appealing, must state precisely

why they think they must have the sensitive detail.

(When it is agreed that the SSC will have access to

sensitive detail.)

1. A designated SSC staff member will read certain

unscreened files. His notes would be subject to

Agency sanitization.

2 .

In more sensitive situations, senior SSC staff

members will read certain unscreened files.

Their

notes would be subject to Agency anitization.

(When it is not agreed that the SSC staff will have

access

to

sensitive detail, the following will occur:

1. The Director will take the sensitive detail to

higher authority in the NSC for decision

and if the

decision is not

to make the material available to the

staff the sensitive detail will be taken directly to the

Chairman and Vice Chairman of the SSC for final

resolution.

The Agency will to the maximum extent possible provide

contained among the "Presidential materials of the Nixon

Administration."

I appreciate your views on the interpretation to be given

to the Order of the United States District Court for the

District of Columbia in Nixon v. Sampson, et al. However,

I have been advised by the Department of Justice, which

represents me as a named defendant in this litigation, that

the Order, as it currently stands, prohibits compliance

with this request until counsel; for Mr. Nixon consents to

our undertaking

the necessary search and review of Nixon

Presidential materials. Otherwise, I would be construing

the Order differently from the way Mr. Nixon does and

would be doing so at my peril.: For this reason, we are

unable to comply with your request at this time. In fact,

I thought Mr. Schwarz agreed with me that only a further

clarifying order by the Court would enable me to conduct

a unilateral search.

As you are aware, it is the policy of this Administration

to cooperate fully with the investigations of the Select

Committee. However, under the Order of the District Court,

we lack the unqualified authority to review unilaterally

the documents on the basis of your request.

Until these

materials have been reviewed, we cannot address the

question of the handling of any

of these materials by this

Clair?

Administration. I can assure you that this is in no

way intended to reflect any change in our desire to

cooperate fully with the investigation.

I trust that you understand our position in this

matter.

United States Senate

Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator:

As you know, the Department of Justice has under-

taken an

investigation into various intelligence

operations of the Central Intelligence Agency to

ascertain whether such activities might constitute

prosecutable violations of Federal criminal law.

It

is noted that, in furtherance of its responsibilities

in the area of intelligence activities, your Committee

has also instituted its own

inquiries into CIA intel-

ligence operations.

It is requested that this Department be afforded

access to any information maintained by your Committee,

supplemental to that contained in the Rockefeller

Commission files, including any transcripts of testi-

mony which may have been taken in either open or executive

sessions, that may have a bearing on the investigation

currently being conducted by this Department.
