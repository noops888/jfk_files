Mr. Goodwin. Richard M. Goodwin, 1536 32nd Street, N.W.,

| Washington, 0.¢.

Mr. Schwarz. And as a mactar of course, we tall all of
our witnesses what they no douht know, that they have their
right to counsel, and you know that, and if you want to stop
te obtain counsel, you know that you can do that?

Mr. Goodwin. I already have too many lawyers,

Mr. Schwarz. And you know what your constitutional
rights ere?

Mr. Goodwin. Hopefully.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, what connection did you have with the
Dominican Republic in the winter and apring of 19617

Mr. Goodwin. I cama into the White House aa Assistant
Special Counsel to the President, having worked on Latin

American affaira policy statements in the preceeding campaign.

i became involved in Latin America. And from that period until

I left to go to the State Department, I was involved on a
daily basis with President Kennedy and his actitities'’in Latin
America which dncluded what was happening in the Dominican
Republic in terms that I drafted contingency plans, I prepare:

cables that went to Mr. Dearborn focussing on the areas that

you are interested in, and f was with him every day on somethin;

connected with Latin America.

Mr, Schwarz, Without your turning to the documentary

TOP SECRET



material, would you recount for the Committee your understand! n:
i of what the United States governmant polley toward the Dominic
Republic was in the winter and spring of '61 and what action:
wera taken to implement that poliey,

Mr. Goodwin. Well, that policy was 4 continuation of th.
policy established by President Eisenhower when he, in
2 accordance with the vote of the OAS, voted to sever -= decide! |

@ | to savar diplomatic and commercial relations with tha Dominican ;

bes 9 | Republic and the sitdation whith you know arcee wis precipitated
~ :
6 1o | by the attempted assassination of Prasident Betancourt by the

~ 12 ] Preeident of the Dominican Republic.

So that from that point on when we came in, the feeling

ra
np

was, first of all, of course that Trujillo was even more

wane
w
a

14 || 4t odds with the philosophy of the Alliance for Proqresa tha:
# .
15 had bean and beyond that; having cut off diplomatic and other

f numbered. The principal support of the regime in that decade
17

la which was often in great domestic difficulty had been the

i yg || concept of American support, it strengthened Trujillo agains:
: 4 20 | his opposition,
{ 1 At that point our policy became one of trying to antici:
J 2p at least, the fall of Trujillo. Of course the Castro thing
! gy | waa very much in everybody's mind and the principal concern o:
@ i 24 tha President, the ona thing he didn't want was for Trujillo
. to go and a Communist leader to coma in. - So I think the policy!

was to keep up our economia and diplomatic prassure to hope

that when Trujillo went, howaver he went, wheather violently or
Peacefully or died a natural death that the guccassion would
be a moderate, democratic group friendly to the interests of
the United States in the Caribbean and therefore try to keap in
touch with and halp out and keep communications open with

the potential sucesssor groups, and it was very hard to
pinpoint.

Mr. Schwarz, What steps did you take during the period
of time you ware involvad, or prior thereto, if you know
about it, in order to assist one or more of the dissident
groups?

Mr. Goodwin. Well, wa did al) sorta == everything from
Policy statements, tha usé of USIA, the ude of: ecodomic
Pressure, to maintain our network of contacts with exile
groups principally'in New York and elsewhere. A certain number

of limited covert operations, some transfer of arms. Dearborn

of course was ona of ths principals, his principal instruction
was to try to kasp all channels of communication open, he was
zealous in thie beacause he disliked Trujiilo intensely hinself |
and felt that he ought to be allied with these other groups.
And I raad through the sort of overall Planning papers, and ©
think they fairly reflect that range of operations.

None of them warw terribly affactive.

Mr. Schwarz. In connection with the transfer of arma,

was provided to transfer arme?
Mr. Goodwin. January 12, 1960, under President Risenhower
Mr. Schwarz. And that was at a mueting of the Special
Group?
Mr. Goodwin. Wall, I don't know beacause they didn't let

me in that week, but there was an NSC action memorandum of

some kind which just set forth the authorization. I don't reall

know the procedure.

Mr. Schwarz. When were the erms passed?

Mr. Goodwin. % don’t’ know. Tf became aware of the trans
of arms. The transfer I think you're thinking of is the

transfer of a couple of carbines and .39 pistols. After the

transfer had been made,: 1 the message of communication that
came to us from the Dominican Republic along with the request
for the transfer of machine guns which ware to be used in an
effort to kill Trujillo, the smaller guns were to be given as
Dearborn told me later in conversation after the assassination
because these people feit their own lives were in danger,
especially if they embarked on anything ‘as risky as trying to
kill Trujillo, and they wanted some self-defense weapons, and
they were given to them for aelf-defense and then they made a
Fequest that they wanted weapons to try an assassination, they

wanted a machine gun,

tried and most of them, thay were all dead. ft was a vary
risky business. It's not tha kind of thing they would want to
try with a .38,

And f think also, I mean nobody, TI think -- as I say, we
had no particular anticipation that thia or any other group
would be successful in something that nobody had been able to
do for thirty years, but at any rate, those were the backstops.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you know how the arms were passed into
the Dominican Rapublic, as opposed to passed to the dissidents?

Mr. Goodwin, No, I only know what Dearborn later told ma
in conversation. I only have this fifteen year old mamory
on my part that he qave them to them in the consulate. IT may
have known at one time how ha qot them. There were @ lot of

gune in the Dominican Republic. \ 24

Mr. Schwarz, Did you worl

Mr. Goodwin. I did not know that, but T wouldn't be

the message is in here. J think it was after President
Kennedy took office. .

Me. Schwarz, Would you read into the record, Mr. Goodwin,

this is a memorandum for the files dated Juna 1, 1961, subject
Report of Point Raised et meeting with Vice President.

Would you read into the record tha second paragraph? 1

Mr. Gocdwin. “At one point during tha meeting, the Vice
Prasident asked about the three carbines which the Agency had |
turned over to the dissidents, spacifically asked about the
date of delivery. Mr. Goodwin made a statement to the effect
that this was done under the previous Administration, L.e.,
prior to January 20, 1961, pursuant to a decision of the
Special Group.” :

Can you tell me if this hia mamo I'm reading? I'd like :
to know,

Mr. Schwarz. Well, there are soma initials at the bottom |

of the page, do they help you decide whosa memo it is?

Mr. Dennin. I believe wa were told by Secretary of State
Rusk that it's Under Sscratary of State Johngon. That's what

the U stands for.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you make that statemant, Mr. Goodwin?
Mr. Goodwin. I don't remember making it. Te is an
{inaccurate statement, and there was a clear record that it
would be inaccurate in documents that I had already seen.

Me. Goodwin. The delivery'of the arms was not made prior
to January 20th. ‘The authorization, Senator, was prior to

Senator Schvaiker. Was when, again? Was what date?

Mr. Goodwin. The authorization was tha 12th of January.

Senator Schwaiker. What year?

Mr, Goodwin. 1961.

Senator Schweiker. And delivery was when?

Me. Schwarz. Somatime aubsequent to Jahuary 20th.

Mr. Goodwin. Well, now that I look at this, all it says
was late January.

The Chairman, ‘This is June lst, this is dated June lst,
and you ara reported to have said, "At one point during the
meating the Vice President asked about the three carbines
which tha Agency had turned over te the dissidents and
specifically asked ahout the date of delivery. Mr. Goodwin
made the statement to the affect that this was done under
the previous Administration, i.e., prior to January 20th,

Actually the delivery took place after January 20th 1962.

“xr. Goodwin. Well that was my firat impression on reading
that, but I notice that all it says was late January, Senator,
so ft suppose the 20th of the 19th in somebody's mind could be
late January. I mean, } don't really remamber.

Mr. Goodwin. I may have known. All I -- my first
knowledga was this document, the timetable that I requested
which simply informed me that the delivery of carbines had heen
made in late January. I don't know any more than that.

Mr. Schwarz. All right.

Mr. Goodwin. Thie is my source of knowledge. may have
learned more subsequent to it if Mearborn pinpointed it.

Me, Schwarz. In addition with dealing with Dearborn, were
you dealing with anybody from the CIA on this?

Mr. Goodwin. Wall, they wera always at the meetings.

Mr. Schwarz. Who do you remambar from tha CIA?

Mr. Goodwin. Tracy Barnes ~~ I can't be eure who all was
there. At the meeting with the Vice President, I'm sure some-

sure you must have a list.

Mr. Schwarz. tlow I would like you to testify in answer to
a series of questions as to what you Were or ware not told.

Now, were you told that the arms which had been delivered
had been delivered to persons who said at times that they
wanted te use them for personal defanse, but who said more
often that they wanted to usa them for assassination pursoses?

to help.

Now, were you informed by the Agency oF by anyone else
that the dissidents intended to accomplish the aagasaination
with the small arms whether or not they got the machines?

Mr. Goodwin, I was informed that both this and other
groups intended and wanted to assassinate Trujillo, We got
reports of assassinations about to occur almost every two or
three weeks in the White House. There is a long gap between

wanting to kill gtrujillo and being able to do it, and -- but

Mr, Schwarz, I'm going to coma to that. 1 want to know

You didn’t answer my question. You said you were frequently

diasidents that they intended to accomplish the assassination

between these weapons which ware to be used for purposes of

project and tha desire for assassination weapons which would

Our response to this briefing paper was immediately to

instructions to the Consul about the nature of future’ relations }

with dissidents, because the President felt that thing®

Dominican Republic.

So we did prapare that paper. The President had, as 1
said, two great concerns. He didn't want anybody trying to
push Trujillo over unless he knaw what was going to happen
next, because hea would much rather have Trujillo in there than
a Communist’. leader. And secondly, that the United States
not be associated with any kind of violent overthrow. And in |

the telegram that was -° ‘

Now whan the President told you that those wera his
two concerns, what action was then taken to implement the

There was a proposal mada in the State Department varsion |

that has bean discussed that the dissident groups, that in case:

the Chairman. All right.

Than the second paragraph, “We consider it essential that
you continus to work" -- wall, before we go on with the second
paragraph, in the first paragraph you say, “the President has

Now, what were those contingency plans that had been

Mr. Goodwin. They have them here, I believe. I think
this is a very thick document, whare you have 4 ties of
contingency plans, it discus here. “Tha paramount interest

of the United States is to assure that Castro-Communist

elements not take over.” It gays Trujillo te weak, and then it,

is an analysis of the dissidents and their intention, the ‘
weakness of the Trujillo ragima, and it goes into the covart
activities, which, I think probably ~~ is that yoor principal

dhe Chairman. There ie nothing in that contingency
“plan that contemplatad the assassination of Trujillo himself?

Mr. Goodwin. It contemplated only the possibility that
ha might be assassinated, not that we would assassinate him.

The Chairman. But if he were assassinated, it would have
presumably been the resuit of an action by a dissident: group
to overthrow his regime?

Mr. Goodwin. Yes.

The Chairman, Ali right.

Moving to Paragraph 2 in your message ~~ the President's
message to Mr. Dearborn, “Ne consider it ansential that you
continue to work to strengthen pro-U.S. sentiment among dissi-~
dent groups. Your work along this line has been invaluable.
Howavar, wa must not run the risk of U.S. association with

political assassination, since the U.S., as a matter of general

policy cannot condons assassination, This last principle is

overriding and must prevail in doubtful situations.”

tow that language, it has been suggested by some members

of the Committee that your concern here had to do with avoiding
any relationship that might lead to a disclosure that the

united States had indwed an interest in or was somehow involved

in a plot to assassinate Trujillo. Because you say, “nowsvar

we must not run the risk of 0.8. jociation with political

assassination, since the U.S. as a matter of general poliey

| riding and must prevail in doubtful situations."

Now don't thoes words at laast convey or land themselves
to the interpretation that your primary concarn was that the
United States should not get caught?

Mr. Goodwin. Well, I don't heldeve so, Senator, because

I think, to me, the plain meaning of the words and as t
underatood it was that we must not run the risk of U.S.
association with political assassination, That means not
be associated with the process of political assassination in

Machine guns were in the country but had not been turned over

Senator Raker. And now, in retrospect, we're not quite

with the material in hand.

Mr. Goodwin. I believe they had additional guns of their
own. You wouldn't try it with a .38.

that it was your understanding that the meaning of that
sentence -~ that that sentence was intended to convey to Mr.
Dearborn a prohibition against involving the United States

in an assassination attempt on tha life of Mr. Trujillo?

Mr. Goodwin. Absolutely. And in my firat draft, I did it
in terme of Aisclosure and changed that, struck that phra
about disclosure in order to make the point, and always at the
President's instruction, to make absolutely clear to the Consul)
because I used‘the very word disclosure, you can see here, and

that the President was not aware of any transfer of guns,
because he told ma he was not aware of it, until wa finally
Kequested a review a couple of months, a few months later, of

The Chairman. Well, you See, we know, from your testimony,

that you had been advised in May that certain weapons had
transferrad to certain dissident groups who at least had
oxpressud an interest in assassinating Trujillo.

Mx. Goodwin. Corract.

Tha Chairman. So there was @ connection, the connection
being that the Amarican government, through the CIA, furnished
weapons to a group that had communicated ite interest, if not
its intention, to assassinate Trujille.

$0 then you send this message, and I'm asking you if the
massage was meant to call this off, this involvement. What
exactly was meant? You weren't saying recover those arms.

Mr. Goodwin, No, I wasn't. No.

The Chairman. But at the same time, you ware saying, den’
transfer the machine guns, ware you not?

Mr. Goodwin. That's right. I think the President -- what
Wa Were saying is --

Mr. Goodwin. We were saving that we didn’t want to do

from this is that wa don't want to be involved, but go ahead
and have the other-guys on, because their position would be to
assassinate Trujillo, s0 what you are in affect doing is saying,’
let's don't be involved in it but let's indicate our support
for what they are doing.

Mr. Goodwin. We were indicating our support for what they,

were doing on the basis of the astimate in the contingency

paper that Trujillo's days ware numhered and whoever took offica

we wanted to ba our man. that is correct. And so wa were goina |
to support and try to retain relations and say we would support,
which in not a difficult thing to do, as you know, any qdroup
that might take office and ba moderate and pro-tnited States.
That was all we wore interested in, was having a pro-American
government. :

Senator Schweiker. Wall, there are two other references
here, Mr. Goodwin. Paragraph 3, “In case of assassination or ¢
overthrow” -- obviously you still had a reference thare, whether
dnitiated by a pro-U.S. group or not, was #till part of the
planning, and then back on page 3 you say, "In actual fact, we
feel tha transfer of arms would serve very little purpose and

expose tha United States to great danger of ultimate disclosure |

1 in participation in an easassination attempt," and that is

scratched out, and says “assassination attempt,” meaning that

! that there were various groups planning to assassinate

" tn fact did you delete those four words, “ultimate disclonure

Since the ultimate would still be disclosed if you gave this.

So what interpretation? I mean, thie is rift here with
assassination propoaitions, and the fact that you have “ultimate!
disclosure," fear of ultimate disclosure of participation,
meant that certainly there was something already afoot, that
ultimately would be disclosed if you want ahead with this
pass through.

Mr. Goodwin, I think what wa were saying is if we did,
it would be found out ultimately, which means not right away,.
but later. In the case of assassination or overthrow, there

ware many groups, a continual flow of groups, of information,

Senator Schweiker. Well, if that's what it meant, then
why did you delete it?
Mr. Goodwin. Well, I think -~

Senator Schweiker. If that was your interpretation, why

Mr. Goodwin, Could you tell me what page you're reading

ware words that ware going to giva exactly the impression you
are talking about. By talking about ultimate disclosure, We
were afraid of being found out and what we didn't want was any
ct ciation with the assassination attempts, so the reference
to disclosure was struck and the words asscciation were
inserted.

Senator Schweiker. But you still call off -- you still
left the language, in actual fact we feel the transfer of arms
would serve very little purpose and expose the Unitad States
to great danger of association with assasaination attempts.
That still makes the point that you want to make, but you had
other language, that says “ultimate disclosure of participation)

Senator Tower, Well, the next line says, "Continue to

i Senator Mondale. In other words, if I were one of those

Aissidents and T qut that from the United States pursuant to
this earlier agreement, I would feed encouraged to belisve that
T had the support of the United States in killing Trujillo, anal
that we woran’t exactly nautral in that, at least, our govern-
mant was not really neutral, that it encouraged then.

Tt ia true that thay didn't get the machine guns, and it
is true, apparently that what you understood was that they
wanted the machine guns for assassination and thay wanted the
other weapons for personal defanse, but there was atill, it
would seem to me, reason for them to believe thet they had our
support.

Why didn't we say or communicate to them we want you to
stop and wa don't want this man assasainated, and we want you
to know that we will have nothing to do with it?

The Chairman. Fritz, leok at the way Dearborn is. 7

them you're no longer connected with their scheme and tr.
Dearborn had not been instructed to tell them that.

to the dissidente, and that f# what ia what Kennedy, of course,

had said in the telegram. And the request had been to know

whether or not he could supply arms.
So that I see from that point of view, I am not sure,

quite clear, in what way he misinterpreted the telegram.

The Chairman. Wall, let's go down =-- I don't think he

i them,

has misinterpreted his instructions not to supply more arma.

That's clear enough. But if you go down to B -- are you with

ma now?
Nr. Goodwin. .

The Chairman. “Since local CAS" == I quass that should

and that would bse CIA Chiaf of Station -- "Since local Chiaf

of Station is now to engaqe mainly in intelligence collection

position.”

Now Y would read those words aa meaning that Mr. Dearborn
anticipated at least the real possibility of assaseination
attempts in the immediate future and that he was recommendine
that thoaa CIA officers that had been connacted with having
supplied weapons should be taken out of the Dominican Republic

right away.

Mr. Goodwin, Well, T would agraa with a good part of that.)
i

Senator, although I think that there were assassination plots
aimmaring in the Dominican Republic and now, and of course this
in fact took place. And f think he wes concerned that the
assassination would be unsuccesaful, that Trujillo would pick
up the Americans and find out not simply about the transfer of
guns but the whole range of covert activities that thay had
been engaged in, torture them and perhaps kill then.

And he thought the safest thing to do, with this thing in

the alr, was to get them out of the country. There was nothings

I think, in the telsgram that waa sent to him that denies the |
possibility that Trujillo might be assassinated or that there
might be an attempted assassination, which igs the purport of
Duarborn’s, because if the assassination was successful, thern
was no nuad to get the CIA out.

The Chairman. . But there is somathing more, raally. If

the possibility of assassination was a long continuing thins,

always on the mind of Pearhorn, why doas he raspond to this

inatruction by saying, gat these man out now?
Mr. Goodwin, Well IY think obviously these people had

ralayed to him that they're going to try to make the attempt

anyway, with or without the machine guns. lle thought the attempt

might be ebortive, and if so, ha thought that all Americans or

people that worked for him or with him would be in danger

The Chairman. Then -you would have to aares with me,
wouldn't you, that in his opinion, Mearborn's opinion, he had
evidence that suggasted te him that en assination attempt
was imminent.

Mr, Goodwin. 1 think that’s clear. Yaa, T think it was.

The Chairman. And he took this sufficiently serious to
recommend gatting the three CIA agents out without further
delay?

Mr. Goodwin. 1% think that's right. That's absolutely

l true, because I think he believed that there was a serious

attempt in the offing, as‘indesd there was, and he was absolute!)
right and he was doing his job wall.

I would like to say, if T might go back, that in terms of

| che telegram, is that I sat in the office with Prasident
b Kennedy who instructed me to draft a telegram to say that ha

ll wanted nothing to do with political assassinations, which 1

did, so it's not a matter of interpretation, because ha cannot

Senator Mondale. In othar words, the President was
advised by you that there was an aséasaination plot in which we
were implicated and he told you that we don't want any part of
it and you are to send & message on his authority saying that.
and that is what you thought you had done?

Nr. Goodwin, 1 would phrase it a little bit differently,
Senator, which is to say I would say there were people who
wanted to assassinate Trujillo to whom wa had given some guns
! and his response was probably like, ycu mean some idiot dave
them guns? I said, yes. Ha said -- thin is a paraphras!

you know, if you knaw Senator Kennedy, or President Kennedy,

 t mean, he said, well, let’s make it clear. And if you compara

course, than the President.

It 4s clear that the stress is changed to make it clear

that the President wants nothing to do and cannot condone
"assassination. t does not say cannot condone being caught at
assassination, 4¢ says cannot condone assassination. And.t did
that becauss he told ms to do that.

you knew that, to the extent that weapons had heen furnished

Mr. Goodwin, Thay Were =~ their position was that, what

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, could t ask a question in

that respect?

the Chairman, Well, I am not sure I agree with that,
although that is a philesephical argument.

Senator faker. Are you talling us, Mr. Goodwin, that
assassination, not of heads of state, hut assassination of
lesser figures wan a common, ordinary occurrance in South
America at the behest of America or with American support?

Mr. Goodwin. No, 1 am talking about that we supply arms
to revolutionary groups or to armed groups which we did in
say Bolivia, or sometimes to the government itself, or in Chile
we gave assistance of various kinds to dissident groups with
the knowledge that our assistance would he used in interne}
struggles.

1 don’t have to use the word assassinations.

Senator Baker. Sut how about for internal strucgles, then,
as opposed to assassination?

Me. Goodwin. Wall, this ig an internal struggle in the
Dominican Republic.

The Chairman, I think you racoqnize the distinction,

8 a difference between first deqres murder and manslaughter.

laws as the most reprehensible kind of homicide end therefora
definted as murder'in the first deqrae. So there mist ba some
gradation there.

Mr. Goodwin. Well, there are gradations, although I do
think that many of the activities against, say, someone like
Allende or others are equally tarqettsd in Latin American
countries and not just general conflict or the killing of
particular t- Mexicans, ‘ofcourse, traditionally go out and
shoot down leadars of new guerrilla groups or insurdents, but
not necessarily with our guns.

Mr. Dannin. Well, whan you seid thera were no more

about meetings held after the assassination back {n Washington
whan Mr. Dearborn came back as well as those maetings held
after the assassination before he came back, at which the
whole matter was discussed, initially with Vics President
Johnson presiding and ultimately, the last one, with President
Kannedy.

Mr. Goodwin. That's right. Wa had, of course, « series
of amargencias. Wa had an emergency meeting, and cabled the
President who was in Paris, and the first matter on our mind
was how to ksep Ramfes Trujillo, who was the son of Trujillo,
from taking over, and we didn't know where he was, at first,
it took us awhile to find out that he was in Paris, which at
least (ndicated, Senator, that if they were planning it, it
: wasn't done in a very comprehensive fashion, and wa found he
was in Paris and we wanted to stop him from returning, to
detain him, but it was too hate. By the time wa found out, he
had already chartered an Air France jet and was on his way to
Cuidad Trujillo, and I believe thare was some affort made to

biufé him off by sending massages to ths plane in flight,

diverting it to somy Amyrican airport, but he didn't do that.

and he landed and took ovar. And I think the principal aim of
our policy from that point on was how to qat him and his uncle,
Nector -- and I forget tha othar fellow's nama -- out of there
so that tha kind of moderata government that wa wanted could

i bu installed.

TOP SECRET



And John Martin was ment down to talk to him and to make
various inducements Like ha could take his money out, it was
discussed that if he would leave peaceably, but what finally
happened waa when McNamara moved the fleet in over the horizon
and an Air Forca Ganeral bombed the palace, that was the end,
he got on his boat and left.

The Chairman. Air Force Ganeral?

Mr. Goodwin, A Nominican Air Force Ganeral.

Ite decided that was an easier target than the Ametican
Float.

Tha Chairman, Was tha bombing done at our instruction?

Mr, Goodwin. No, I don't bullave so. T was tryina to

Temambur that, but I don't balieve it was. As T remember,

mame a rae

, it was quite a surprise to us that this fallow had taken the

initiative. The moving of the fleet was intended as sort of

a threat that if they didn't gat out we might come in and qet
them, There was no, however, no, at that point, no country

| attempted to do that, just to scare them. And the fleet was
} actually cheered in the Dominican Republic, a very rare
occasion.

But this Air Force Ganarat did, and then he tried to make

fl himself dictator and two of his own officers arrested him. They

all had been trained in American military schools.
Mr. Schwarz. To complete the record on the responsa to

the teleqram We had Mearborn'a raaction. - We will read into

response to the telegram “Mr. Goodwin drafted.
