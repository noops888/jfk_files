The Chairman. Our witness this morning is the Honorable
Edward H. Levi, Attorney General of the United States, Mr.
Levi has appeared before this Committee on previous occasions
and this Committee was most happy to welcome him back again .

this morning.

He has been asked to testify today about the future of

“the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and especially its

domestic intelligence operations,

This morning's hearing marks both an end and a beginning
for the Select Committee. It is the end of a series of hearing.
on domestic intelligence which began in September with an

“examination of the so-called “Huston Plan.” Those original
hearings explored the relationship of the White House to the
FBI and other intelligence agencies in the development of a
specific plan for using illegal techniques against domestic’

groups.

At that time the Committee learned the details of FBI
black bag jobs against domestic targets which continued at leas

until 1968. We learned of a "do. not file” procedure in the

PBI for destroying the records of these operations and the Com-
: : \
mittee was told that the FBI expanded its intelligence

investigations along the lines of the Huston Plan, even after

the President wilthdrew his approval.

Our next hearings in this area dealt with improper

NW-SSttO—Dockd+32989560—Rage_5



activities that overlapped foreign and domestic intelligence
operations. The Director of the National Security Agency.
3. testified that the sophisticated surveillance operations. of”

4 that agency had’ been targeted against the international

5 communications of American citizens for domestic intelligenc]

6 purposes, This was done in direct’ cooperation with the FBI,.

a which supplied names of citizens for the NSA watchlist. .

8 Present and former FBI officials also testified that until
9 1966 the Bureau undertook programs for illegally poet the

Lo |} mail of innocent citizens in the search for espionage agents
11 || and foreign intelligence. The FBI used the CIA's mail

12 |} opening program after 1966 for a intelligence purposes,
13 || again sending over lists of names of American citizens who

14 | were to be watched, ,

15 The Committee's recent hearings on the FBI itself have

16 || raised some of the most fundamental questions that any democrac
“17 | must face. We have placed on the record deeply disturbing
18 information about the FBI’s COINTELPRO activities over a period
-19 || of fifteen years; the attempts to discredit Dr. Martin Luther
go || Xing, Jr., the broad surveillance of law-abiding citizens

e1 || and lawful activities, the practices of infiltration and dis-
22 || ruption by informants, and the political use of FBI resources
23 | by Presidents of both Sere

Pe The Committee's work in this area has been aided sub-

25 || stantially by the cooperation of the Justice Department. I

would like to take this opportunity, Mr. Attorney General, to

express the appreciation of the entire Committee and the

| staff for your assistance in making available the materials

needed for this investigation. Our eeieianed has demonstrated
that the Constitutional principle of Separation of Powers has
enough flexibility to allow clase cooperation between the
Congress and the Executive in a matter of the greatest public

concern,

ie While our investigation is coming to an end, the task

of making constructive recommendations is beginning. We

have heard this week from former officials and from Director
Kelley. We are exploring a wide range of proposals, including
those being developed by the Justice Department. And we

look forward to working. closely with you on these issues.

One .of the best statements of the problems we confront
was made last summer by Philip Kurland, Professor of
Constitutional Law at the University of Chicago. Professor
Kurland spoke of the threats to an open, democratic society
from what he called the perversion of our intelligence agencies
into political police forces, He rejected the proposition
that we should be satisfied that these agencies will exercise
self-restraint. Professor Kurland did not deny the importance
of the. individual qualities of the officeholder. But he
stressed the greater importance of confining our intelligence

and counter-intelligence agencies to the limited functions they

were created to deal with.

The crucial responsibility lies with the Congress, "If

oversight by Congress is not to be the answer," Professor .

Kurland declared, "it is hard to conceive of an answer." The

essential requirement for Congressional oversight is informatior
| about intelligence operations, and the greatest barrier is
Executive secrecy. consequently, Professor Kurland and others
have urged that we establish eres which require the
aeenneiee to provide this information to.the Congress. This
may be the only way to insure the responsibility of the
Executive Branch to the people through the Congress,

Therefore, we especially hope that you, Mr. Attorne
General, can help this Conmittee and the Congress develop.
not only standards for the FBI, but also procedures for

effective Congressional oversight to-assure regular account-

ability.

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE EDWARD Ii. LEVI, ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.

Attorney General Levi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Before I begin, let me say that I an ee that your
statenent is meant to indicate that I am committed to agreé ae
.with my friend, Professor Kurland, who may not be wrong as
often as many people are but occasionally is not correct.

The Chairman. Wo, it was only méant that I agree with”
him.

Attorney General Levi. Then I hope the matter can he
explored more in depth.

Senator Mathias. Mr. Chairman, I think that's one of the

most graceful declarations of independence I have ever heard.
Attorney General Levi. lir. Chairman, the Committee has.

asked me to talk with you today about the futuxe of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation. I thought it might be helpful

if I outline quite briefly some of the points I would like

to make, some of the problems I think ought to be considered,

and some of the steps we have taken.

The first point is that the statutory base for the

The basic statutory provision ‘is 28 usc 533 which provides
‘that the Attorney General may appoint officials "(1) to detect
and prosecute omimes against the United States; (2) to assist

i

operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully satisfactory

Docld:32989560 Page



investigations regarding official matters under the control

-of the Department of Justice and the Department of State

ay be directed by the Attorney General.” There are other

as mM

statutes, such as the Congressional Assassination, Kidnapping

and Assault Act, which vest in the Bureau special responsibilit

to investigate criminal violations, In addition, there are

Executive orders and Presidential statements or Cirectives
which place investigatory responsibilities upon the Bureau.

A number of questions are often asked about-this statutory

base. It has the virtue of simplicity, but the Executive orders

which deal with government employee investigations are compli-

cated and confusing, and Presidential memoranda, or, perhaps,

oral instructions from a ‘President may be difficult to collate.

I think it is important, in any case, to separate out the kinds

of questions which are asked about the Bureau's authority base,,
Some questions .are constitutional in nature, relating to the
inherent power of the President; others go to the interpretati.
of the statutes and the relationship between the statutes and
Presidential directives; others go to the failure of

the statutes to define sufficiently the areas of the Bureau's
jurisdiction or to spell out sufficiently -- and this is
partly constitutional ~~ the means and methods which the
Bureau is permitted to use in carrying out its assigned tasks.

The second point, related to the first, is a continuing

ddiscussion of the role of the Bureau in intelligence investigat



ee See
or domestic security investigations. The argument is sometimes
made that the Bureau's proper role, at least in purely
domestic matters" should be limited to investigations of
committed crimes. The basic statute for the Bureau 185 broader

than this, as have béen Executive orders and Presidential

mandates to the Bureau. The basic statute is broader since it

xefers to investigations regarding official matters under the

control of the Department of Justice and the Department of
State as may be directed by the Attorney General. A disparity
is sometimes seen among the different roles of en
in crime detection, in on-going dotuestic security matters,
and in-foreign intelligence or foreign counter~intelligence
matters. In recent days a statement by then Attorney General
Harlan Fiske Stone, who reorganized the Bureau and ey a.
Edgar Hoover as its director, has been quoted as a relevant
warning.

Stone warned, “there is always the possibility that a
Secret police may become a menace to Eree government and free

institutions, because it carries with it the possibility

of abuses of power which are not always quickly apprehended

or understood. It is important that its activities be
strictly limited to the, performance of those functions for
which it was created and that its agents themselves be not
above the law or beyond its reach. The Bureau of Investigation

is not concerned with political or other opinions of individual

It is concerned only with'their conduct and then only ‘with such
conduct as is forbidden by the laws of the United States.
When a police system passes beyond these lifits, it is dangeroud

to the proper administration of justice and to human liberty,

which it should be our first concern to cherish."

I should like to suggest that Stoné's warning always
must be considered relevant to the proper conduct of the
Bureau's duties, but it does not necessarily follow that
domestic security investigations are, therefore, outside the

Bureau's proper functions. The detection of crime in some

areas requires preparation and at least some knowledge of what
is likely to be going on. What is at issue, I think, is the

proper’ scope, the means and methods used, the attention paid

to conduct and not views, and the closeness of the relationship
of the conduct and that which is fortizden by the laws of
the United States.

Third; I realize that some proposals, since I was |
asked about this when I last appeared before this Committee,
might separate out in some fashion domestic and foreign
intelligence functions from the FRI or from one another within
the FBI. This is, of course, an issue to be looked at. I
assume it is recognized that there may be some relationship
between that intelligence which is involved in foreign counter~

intelligence work. One may lead to the other. And there may

be a relationship between foreign counter-intelligence and

| consideration has been that it might be decided that information

conduct is lived up to. My hope is that the fact that the FBI

_ Strictly enforced by the courts, gives the organization’ an

foreign intelligence. -If the work were separated out into
different agencies, I do not know if the decision about when an
investigation should pass from one agency to. another alvays
could be made easily. Moreover, even so, information presumably

would pass from one agency to the other. I know that one

collected by some permitted means in intelligence investigations
under -some circumstances should not be used in criminal
prosecutions. But if there is an exchange of information,

this must always be a consideration, whether there are eeoeeate
agencies or not, and the basic question then is one of use

and not organization. The more active concern, I believe, is.
that there is a risk that conduct proper for one area may be
improper for another, and that the combination can work a

contamination. My view on this is that-in any case we must

decide what conduct is appropriate and is inappropriate.for eacl

of the areas, and we must take steps ‘to make sure that proper

has criminal investigative responsibilities, which must be

conducted within the confines. of constitutional protections

awareness of.the interests of ‘individual liberties that might
be ‘missing in an agency devoted solely to intelligence work.
I know the argument can be run the other. way. I believe the

dangers are greater is there is separation.

Fourth, there is a question.as to the.proper role of the

FBI in crime prevention and whether or not it should be con-

sidered authorized to take steps under some-circumstances to
reduce the likelihood that crimes will be committed ox that
sexious injury to persons or property will occur. IE

Preventive action has raised serious questions and these
must be dealt with. ‘I suppose an initial question is whether
it should be allowed at all. Yet I believe under special

circumstances and-with proper controls most would believe this

to be a proper function.

Fifth, the problem of proper controls, supervision and
accountability is all-embracing. By statute the Federal Bureau
of Investigation is in the Department of Justice, and also by
statute the Attorney General is the head of the Department of
Justice. _ The history is mixed, of course, and we all have ia
tendency to over-simplify, but it is a fair statement that

there have been times in the past when the supervision by

Attorneys General, granted that the Bureau must have consider-

able autonomy, has been sporadic, practically nonexistent, or

ineffective.

I hope that is not the case now. The responsibility is a

heavy one. But in any event the problem of proper controls,

supervision and accountability goes beyond the Director of

thé Bureau and the Attorney General. I have already mentioned

that in my view the statutory base for the operations of the_

Bureau cannot be said to be fully satisfactory. I think that
better controls and performance can be achieved through
statutory means, executive orders, guidelines, and reporting
to appropriate congressional. committees.

Sixth, before I come to a resume of some of the steps
which have been taken, let me say I know we all realize that
in the past there have been grave abuses, I am uncomfortable
with a kind of writing of history, however, which sees it only
Pee of the abuses and not in terms of past and present
strength. It is very difficult to be fair to the past in
which many ingtitutions of government carried a share of
responsibility. But more than unfairness is involved, if we
are not careful, we will turn to solutions of the moment which
a better reading of history might indicate are not the best
solutions.

I know we must seize the. moment, if I may use such a
phrase ‘in this setting. I know also that this committee
realizes that a very important agency with dedicated, highly
professional, greatly disciplined government servants is
involved. The importance is to the’ security and domestic
tranquility of the United States. Stone's warning was given

in an act of creation.. He was proud of his creation. In spite

of the abuses, there is a proper place for pride. I take it

our mutual work ‘should be to nurture that pride and the condi-

tions which justify it.

I turn now to a review of some of the steps which have

been taken or are in progress. We have tried most diligently,

under safeguards to protect the privacy of-individuals and

with an:awareness of the unfairness of instant history to. give

a great deal of information to congressional committees,

Attorney General Saxbe made public and Deputy Attorney
General Silberman and Director Kelley testified about the so-
called COINTELPRO. When the FBI aiccweecea evidence of
several more COINTELPRO projects after I became Attorney.
General, these were revealed. One of my first acts as Attorney
General, my third week in office, was to testify before a
congressional committee about possible incidents of political
misuse of the FBI by the White House in the past and about the
nature of FBI file-keeping systems, particularly the files kept
by Director Hoover in his office suite. i

“ Director Kelley has spoken publicly and before congres-
sional committees about incidents in the past in which FBI
/ agents engaged in break-ins to gather or photograph physical
evidence in intelligence investigations. On a number of occa~
| sions, most ee in testimony before this committee, I
have described the history of the use of electronic surveil-
lance by the FBI. We have welcomed such opportunities.

On February 26, 1975, I instructed Director Kelley to

report to me any requests made of the Bureau or practices

within the Bureau which he deems improper or which present the

4 directive and-also asked for a report of all sensitive investi-
gative practices. -

“6 The Director promptly complied. Director Kelley has

Finally, a committee within the Department of Justice,
chaired by Mary Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in th
Office of Legal Counsel, and composed of representatives of
my office, the Criminal and Civil Rights Divisions, the Office
of Policy and Planning, and the FBI, has been working for :
i eight months reviewing FBI procedures in many areas and drafting

guidelines to govern those procedures in the future. The Com-

mittee has produced draft guidelines covering White House

inquiries, congressional and judicial staff appointment civestit

gations, unsolicited mail, and domestic security investigations
It is currently at work on guidelines covering countérespionage
investigations and will later consider the use of informants,
the employee loyalty program, organized crime intelligence
investigations, criminal investigations, and other aspects of

1s || FBI practice. The Committee's work has been extensive and time

16 || Consuming. It has involved not only questions 9f proper safegu:
17 || but also of ‘efficiency in the proper functioning of the Bureau. |.
1g || Tt has been an effort to translate into words the complicated

“46 and important mechanisms for controlling the FBI. I hope the

20 |. Committee's efforts at articulation will be of _ to this Comm
2), | tee and others as it considers drafting legislation.

“ee You have received copies of the latest drafts of the
23 guidelines that have been substantially completed by the

-p4 || Committee. ‘These guidelines do not yet represent Department

25 || policy. There is disagreement within the Department on some

aspects of these guidelines. I have disagreed with the Comme
recommendations from time to time, and the FBI has raised

substantial questions about other recommendations, particularly
with Tie to the treatment of unsolicited mail. Some of the]
proposals in the guidelines could be promulgated as departmental
regulations. Congress may feel some ought to be enacted into
statutory law. Ohter provisions would require implementation by;
executive order.

I would be glad to discuss these draft guidelines with you

in detail in response to your questions, but a brief discussion}

of the guidelines on domestic security may be useful at the
outset. E

The guidelines begin by attempting .to impose some order
and definiteness to the domestic security field. To begin with
these guidelines do not -deal with FBI efforts to counteract
the work of foreign intelligence services operating within the
United States. Standards for determining when.there is foreign
involvement sufficient to place a subject in the category of
foreign counterintelligence investigation are now being
debated within the guidelines committee. The domestic security
guidelines also are not meant to cover security or background
investigations of federal appointees or investigations of
ordinary crimes, Under the draft guidelines, domestic
security investigations are only to be authorized when there

is a likelihood that the activities of individuals or groups



: . : 6 “254°

onl involve or will involve the use of force or violence in violatign

ed - of Federal law. Domestic security investigations are to be
g
ie 3 limited to activities of individuals or groups intended to

accomplish one of five purposes: overthrowing the government
of the United States or of a State; interfering with the
activities within the United States of foreign governments or
their representatives; influencing government policies by
interfering by force or violence a, government functions
ox interstate commerce; depriving individuals of their civil
rights; and creating domestic violence or rioting when such
violence or rioting would necessitate as a countermeasure the
use of Federal armed forces. There is also a provision for

limited investigation when there is a clear and immediate

threat of domestic violence which is likely to result ina

request by a state for Federal armed assistance.

Currently there is no procedure requiring the review
outside the FBI-of all domestic intelligence investigations
conducted by the FBI, though the FBI has a long-standing
policy of reporting its investigative findings to the

- Criminal Division. Under the draft guidelines there would be
a comprehensive program of reporting to the Attorney General or
his designee of all preliminary and full domestic intelligence
investigations. The Attorney General would be required
under the draft guidelines to put a stop to any full investiga-|

tion whose justification did not meet an established standard.

The standard would be that there must be specific and articulable
facts giving reason to believe that the individual or group
under investigation is engaged in the activities I have just
listed. ,

Another feature of the draft guidelines is to place strict}
iiaisienl upon the use of any technique by the FBI which goes
beyond the gathering of information. COINTELPRO was the name
given the use of some such techniques. As I have said
before, some of the activities in COINTELPRO were pie an
the others were foolish. Nonetheless, there may be circum-
stances involving an immediate risk to human life or to
extraordinarily important government functions that could ae e
countered by some ania of preventive action. The guidelines
require that any such preventive action proposal be submitted ,
to the Attorney General. He could: authorize: thé preventive
action only when there’ is probable cause to believe that’ the
violence is imminent and when such measures are necessary to-°
minimize the danger to life or property. The preventive action
would in all cases‘have to-be. nonviolent: The Attorney General
would be required to report to ‘Congress Bei saj eta and no
less often than once a year on the use of preventive action by
the FBI.

i make no claim that during this rather difficult but
|. interesting and, I must ener promising period, ,we have
achieved all that might have been possible. In many ways the

work has been disappointingly slow. But I do think we have
made advances in nurturing and helping to improve a structure
which will be supportive of the best efforts of the men and ol

in the Department of Justice and in the Federal Bureau of Inves

tigation. No procedures are fail-safe against abuse. The best

protection remains the quality and professionalism of the

members of the Bureau and of the -Department.

_ The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Attorney General.’
It's a very helpful statement, and does summarize the efforts
that you are making to give greater, put greater order into
the work of the FBI.

One thing that leaves me somewhat baffled is the --
difference between domestic ‘security action, for which you have
set forth the proposed guidelines, which seem to me to be
good ones, and what you call preventive Seeioait You state
in your statement at page 12 and the top of page 13, after you
eriticize the COINTELPRO program, which this Committee has
explored in some detail, you say "Nonetheless, there may be
circumstances involving an immediate risk to human life or
to extraordinarily important government functions that coudd
only be counteréd by some sort of preventive action."

In that case, why can't the preventive action take the
form of an arrest if there are circumstances involving inmediatd

‘risk to human life or to extraordinarily important government

functions?

Attorney General Levi. If it can, er that would have
to be done because the guidelines specifically require that
the preventive action is necessary and it can't otherwise be
handled.

Now, one can think of incidents --

The Chairman. Can you give us some incidents?

Attorney General Levi. If there is the likelihood of a
violent confrontation between two marching groups on a state
capitol, it is conceivable that blocking off some streets, or
directing signs to some other direction in an emergency
situation of that kind might be useful, and I take it that
is a preventive action, and I would not think unusual, by the
way, for people who are properly trained in work of that kind.

The Chairman. That is a good kind of preventive aare

Suppose that there were two caravans instead of two
marching groups; and that you had reason to believe that they
were headed toward one another and there would be a violent
confrontation once they met. Would permissible preventive
action in those circumstances permit putting sand in the
gas tanks of the automobiles so that neither caravan could

_move?

I have to ask that kind of a question after what we found |

out that the FBI was up to in the COINTELPRO program.
Attorney Gdneral Levi. The answer is no. Certainly

there's no intention, the guidelines do not spell out, and we

have had discussions about that, what kind of precise

preventive action might be possible or might not be possible
under special circumstances.
fhe Chairman. This’is all very vague, and suppose you

had reason to believe that a. prominent figure of some kind in

a movement was about to or of a mind to incite his followers

to violence. Then in that case could you undertake to give

hin a drug. that would prevent him from speaking for three

weeks?

Attorney General Levi: No, of course not, but I have to

add that what the guidelines do say is that the Attorney
General as=t5 give permission, not only does he have-to give

since quite naturally this Committee believes’ that reports
to. the Congress are the. most important thing that any agency
can do, then it seems to ae you must also ee that that is
some safeguard.

The Chairman. Well, that depends upon your view as to the
kina of Committee that can do the job of surveillance.

Attorney General Levi. Well, I don't think -- this really|
was my suggestion before. It takes a combination of control, .
and what we have attempted to do here is to have a guideline
‘which strictly limits -- maybe it should limit more, preventive
action, but- admits that there is an area for it. Now, maybe

we should not admit.

The Chairman. Why couldn't you do it this way, Mr.

necessary, it must be open and public kind of action,

Attorney General Levi. I don't think that telling people 7~-

clashing. Well, when that is the case, the means used are
likely to be reasonable ones. But when there are. secret methods

potential problems, real troubles that we have seen.

Attorney General Levi. Well, we have to take that through

in any event, to very much limit the field.

Now, whether we have limited it enough, I'm not sure.

The Chairman. Did you say that with respect to the domestiic
security activities of the FBI, that before such a project is
undertaken, the Attorney General must give his consent or
that he might be informed of prospective ongoing projects
in order that he can calla given project that he doesn't find
fully justified to a halt?

I didn't quite understand your question.

Attorney General Levi: Well, he has eee he has to
be informed of, I think, all of the investigations. He can
terminate them all. The problem is whether he -- he doesn't
have to authorize the full investigation, but he has to be
informed about it and he can terminate it.

The Chairman. Now, well, you have to authorize wiretaps
and electronic devices in such eooes Why shouldn't -- why
wouldn't it be well for the Attorney General to authorize the
initiation of programs in this particular field, new snvesti-
gatory programs?

Attorney General Levi. Well; I'm trying to protect, if
not myself, at least my successors. I'm not sure that it makes
much difference. It makes some difference. -If the Attorney
General has to authorize ali full investigations, he will have
quite a lot of work to do. If he has to authorize all of

the preliminary investigations, his desk is going to be covered

with a great many ‘things which he doesn't know a great deal

about.

The Chairman. Don't you think there should be some outsidé
check in this area, particularly where we are not dealing with
criminal law enforcement as such, but we are dealing with
potential violence and you referred -to as surveillance of
citizens and groups of citizens for purposes of domestic

security. That's a pretty fuzzy field, and we have seen how

great the abuses were for a long period of time, and don't you
think there should be some outside check, perhaps not with
every case, the Attorney General himself, but some outside
check on the agency in this general field to be sure that they
are following these guidelines?

Attorney General Levi. But I've already said that I
think that there ought to be eegeete Congress. I don't

want to word the scope of the domestic security investigations,|
however, quite the way you have worded them, because ‘these
guidelines which could be in part put into statute, strictly

limit them. They limit them to where there is a likelihood

for preliminary investigations that the activities of

individuals and groups involved would use férce and violence
in violation of laws in particular areas.

And that is for 90 days, and then perhaps another 90 days,
and the kind of investigation which can be done in a

preliminary investigation is also restricted. When you go

Now, whether that is sufficient, I don't suppose anything
is fully sufficient, but I would assume that in addition,-
there can be reports to Congress, and there will have to be
reports to the Attorney General, and I would think that that .
and the lessons of history would provide quite a lot of safe-
guards. If the suggestion is that one should go to a Commissio
or to a court, I must say that I have grave doubts as to whethe
that is the proper solution, but if that were the case, it woul
be a statutory matter, and I would hope that my participation
in making that decision would not be viewed as having as
heavy responsibilities as those who would have to vote for it.

The Chairman. Don't you think, given the_past history
you have referred to, that it might be a very good idea to
take these guidelines which represent to me a good faith
effort on your part to bring order into this general qhaos,

take these guidelines and write them into the law?

Attorney General Levi. I think that undoubtedly parts of
the guidelines should be made statutory. I think ‘that the
problem is, and I am sorry for this, is that it has taken so
long to draft these guidelines, although I think it has been an

extraordinary effort. And the way the guidelines are written

because they do relate to each other. But there may not be
time for that.

As I said, I know we have to seize the ae ie I do
not know how long the moment is. In any event, I agree that
part of the guidelines, at least, ought to be in statutory

The Chairman. Well, at the moment, this committee is.

much cooperation as I know you will give,: baséd upon your
willingness in the past, to see what kina of recommendations
the committee can make, because clearly the FBI does need a
generic statute which it has lacked through the years and that
would be the appropriate.place for guidelines at this time.

Senator Hart, do you have questions?

Senator Hart (Michigan). Mr. Attorney General, good
morning.

First, for a number of years in the Judiciary Committee,
we have been huffing and puffing with a.whole line of Attorneys

General ‘in an effort to-catch them, and it is against that long

period of effort that I want this morning to first of all thank

you for developing to the degree. that you now have, exactly the
kind of thing we have been talking about. And even as we on
the committee in those days were urging guidelines and while we
might not have sounded we understood how incredibly dificult
it is to put down in black and white, chapter and verse, how
you respond in a whole variety of etre

. And for the first time, the Attorney ae come in

with a very solid piece of work that all of us appreciate.

Now in your statement, you indicate that you are working
on guidelines as they relate specifically to informants and
you relate that to the Department's general guidelines on
intelligence that permit the use of this. Now yesterday, as
you know, we discussed with the FBI Director,- the possibility
of yetting judicial approval for informants by you.

: I think all of us understand the importance in an investi-
gation of informants. “But we have heard some stories, some

hair raising stories about the way that can be abused, that

technique can be abused. And I, and I am sure others, suggeste
that informants are an extremely intrusive form. of eavesdroppin
in terms of what: can be reported.

I know that the Supreme Court has not said that informants
are unconstitutional per se under the fourth and first amend-
ents, unless you. get a court warrant, but that does not preven

Congress from requiring that : kind of procedure, in order

1 to fully safeguard the rights of privacy and expression. Now
2 what are your thoughts on such a requirement, the requirement
3 of a neutral, detached third party, rather than the investigating
4 branch of the government deciding when to use targeted infor-
5 mants?

6 Attorney General Levi. Well, I am sorry to say, Senator

- OF Hart, that I do not think that the suggestion on balance is a

8 good one. And that does not mean that I have a-better sugges-
9 tion. Theré is no doubt ‘that informants or paid informants

12 statutory restrictions on that if you think of, again,

14 But the notion that a court would have to authorize the
15 use of each informant and how the fqedenane was ‘to be used,

16 to continue to pass on that, I think would make for mal-
- administration. It would impose an enormous burden on the

20 ||) that it can be the court.

really provide the kind of knowledgable review that you would

want.

So I recognize the problem and I recognize why one might
turn to that suggested solution. I do not want to take away
from your time, but it is sort of interesting that special
devices and protections were developed for électronic surveil-=

lance because they were said to be different from the use of

informants. And now we are.running the argument in the other

direction and saying well, they are even more dangerous than

electronic surveillance because you have the human ear right

there. Pe
So it is just an interesting point. -
Senator Hart (Michigan). Well, maybe in defense of our
earlier attitude, we did not know about the abuse with respect

to the human technique, the number of occasions on which it

has been used.
Attorney General Levi. TI rather think that the fourth

amendment knew more about that than it did about electronic

surveillance.

Senator Hart (Michigan). The fourth amendment drafters

did. But people around now --

Attorney General Levi. I feel for the objective, but I

do not think -- I just think it would not work.
Senator Hart (Michigan). We are agreed that it is a

difficult balance. ‘The national security concern here and the

individual's civil liberties here -- and to balance these
claims is tough. You say you think the court is inappropriate,

Attorney General Levi. I think that would be a mistake.

I think it would also be a mistake to have the court pass on
the activities of the agents, of the Bureau's own agents who”
have ears and listen and so on. I think we have S trust
someone.

. Senator Hart (Michigan). But -is the Director of the FBI
the fellow to trust?

Attorney General Levi. He is certainly one of the persons
that has - be trusted very much, and he has to be put ina
position where it is known that he is. being trusted and what
his Qn ie ies arc

And I think if the congressional mandate and the guide-
lines and whatever else are clear enough, I have ee faith
in human nature to think that that would be abided by. I do
not think the history of the abuses shows that that kind of a
thing really was abused. There was not that kind of spelling |
out. There was not that kind of direction. There were
directions in the other way really; so that I do not think the
problem -- while I do not mean to minimize the prior abuses
which were terrible -~ but I do not think the problem requires
the solution of the interposition at every stage.

Senator Hart (Michigan). If we leave the discretion with

the Director of the Bureau, you would agree that there should

be a ---we always use the word effective even: though we cannot
define how you make it effective -- an effective system under
which somebody other than the Bureau's Director would be
reviewing the decisions he is making, as he affects this
balance.

- Attorney General Levi. I think theré have to be frequent
reviews and I think one has to have a situation in the
Department of Justice where the Reeoeney General or his
designee can be in a position to make that review and I think
one also would hope and require that there be adequate presen-
tation to congressional committees. You do not want to impose

so.many duties on the Attorney General so that he is -- s0

‘that he loses some sense of distance and objectivity on the

Bureau.

_-That is one reason I said one has to realize that there
is not full knowledge and they are different offices. But I
do think the Attorney General, I hope, is some protection and
the Department is and congressional committees would be too.

Senator Hart (Michigan). The earlier hearings, which

PSE some of the excesses, found some citing in the FBI
handbook regulations which directs field offices and their

informants to find out and report all contacts and cooperation

between a group under investigation and other groups, even if

the other groups’ are not suspected of being either extremists

| or subversives.

I would think that part of the investigation would be to put
that down. And that is really what’ you are talking about. And
I do not know that one should want to Limit that.

Senator Hart (Michigan). “well, maybe there is not any _
happy solution to this, but we would be doing would be
reporting on first amendment activities of the other groups
that would not be eligible to be targeted.
raat Attorney General Levi. I think the report should not. be
on that. It should be rather on the effort of the group
properiy being investigated.to gain control. And we do have a
problem as to what one does with the dissemination or keeping
of information, and the guidelines attempt to address that
question, whether they have done so sufficiently or not.

One reason the guidelines are not all finished, when one
gets to the counter or foreign intelligence guidelines and has
to deal with organizations which are under active collaboration
-with foreign governments, and the question is whether they have
extended their influence in such a way as to impose a real
threat of force and violence, I do not know how effectively
ote can impose restrictions.

We try to do it, The proposed guidelines have not been
worked out. One has to remember that if one goed back to the

that is the kind of information that you may not get.

The Chairman. Senator Mathias?

Senator Mathias. If Senator Hart has any question. which

follows right along at this point, I would be glad to yield.

Senator Hart (Michigan). No.

‘ Senator Mathias, Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to

join with Senator Hart in thanking the Attorney General for
all the help he gives to this committee. Whether we call on
him for philosophical treatises or for practical advice, he is
always available. I think that is a very real contribution.

And the way in which he helps us leads me almost to regret that

I did not go to the University of Chicago law school.

Attorney General Levi. Senator, you are going to go far.
Senator Mathias. You have talked a little about the
Smith Act, and about the seditious conspiracy clause in connec-|
tion with the responsibilities of the FBI. And I wonder if you

think there is sort of a dated aspect to these.

actor: General Levi. Oh, ‘of course there is and I want
to say that when one talks about the looseness of the guide-
lines, one ought to read the statutes which came out of
Congress.” that is why I say that it is sort of amusing as we
go around flattering each other, we all bear ~~ I mean all of

the institutions bear responsibility.

Senator Mathias. I could not agree with you more, and I

think I have said repeatedly that I think a lot of the problems
that are dumped in the courts and a lot of the burdens that the
courts bear have begun right, here on Capitol Hill because we

have not carefully sculpted the laws to make it clear what the

legislative intent was. And in fact, perhaps they have been
carefully sculpted to obscure the legislative intent in some
~cases. And the courts then are left with the burden of finally

administering the law rather than either the legislature

prescribing it, or the executive enforcing it.

Attorney General Levi. Not only that, you draft> >
statutes that quite clearly say one thing, the Attorney-
General is then asked for his opinion which he is required to
give,as to what it means to a government Sa He gives
it. Another House of this congress then proceeds to make

motions to hold the man in contempt for following the opinion

of the Attorney General. And Professor Kurland, my good friend

Says dovnot listen to the Attorney General, he is only a

lawyer.
There is a responsibility in Congress for having statutes
clear and for abiding by what they say, and if they do not like

_ them, change them. I agree with you.

Senator Mathias. I would hope that with all the admonitio
that we are giving to other people these days that we take that
one ourselves, that the laws need to be more carefully written.

: Attorney General Levi. So is easier to see abuses

Senator Mathias. Let me say that I think we need some help
in this endeavor, that there are many cases in which the stort
taken by Congress are criticized later when the errors might
have been avoided by some cooperative action in the process.

Attorney General Levi. I meant that to be clear when I
was referring to all parts of the government.

Senator Mathias. But, specifically in relation to the
seditious conspiracy eels the Smith Act, the courts have
talked about the advocacy provisions of the law 80 strictly as
to reqtire incitement of imminent lawless action as a test and
that I think does really date these acts.

Attorney General. Levi. I think so. And while I want
to say that in. the guidelines we tried to ettphasize that there
is a question. of how much one ought to spell out the nature
of the evidence, in part, because I think that even spelling
it out might have a chilling effect.

Senator Mathias. Now you have lead me right to my next

question, which is whether we should ppt any limitations on

domestic: intelligence investigation.

Attorney General ‘Levi. Well it may be that one has to

try one's hand at drafting them. I have.
Senator Mathias. It is a tough one, I think, but we have
seen as a result of this investigation family matters, is that
” proper? Can you prescribe it in a general way that sexual ae
activities, purely legal activities, but perhaps not within the}
mainstream of what most Americans are thinking of doing, per-
sonal relationships, all of this kina of thing --

Attorney General ee Well, one can try. What we did
was, as I say, to provide a very tough and maybe too tough
standard, because it is specific. And articulable facts,
giving reason to believe that an individual is engaged in
activities described in the paragraph which is force and violen e
to do the following things. :

Now,, that may be too restrictive. Now, if one starts to
say what kind of things can one look at which might suggest andl
lead you..to see these things, I do not know. And I suppose
we all have to admit that public attitudes about activities and
therefore maybe the activities themselves mean different things
at different times.

And maybe one has to have a different set of rules created
from time to time and one of the notions of the guideline would
be, I think, to do that.

I am not in favor of Congress every year. deciding whether

it is against homosexuality or particular other aberrant sexual

And therefore this can be included or not included as the
winds blow. I think that would be probably not legislatively

very desirable.

Senator Mathias. Let us suppose, however, just for the”

_ Sake of discussion that these activities are the proper scope
of a domestic intelligence investigation and that that investi-
gation is conducted and its object is obtained and the investi-
gation is closed, then what. should happen to this material,
given the infinite capacity of the government today to store

and retrieve information?

Attorney General Levi. Well, the guidelines attempt to
.go in the direction that after a period of time that material
should be done away with.

Senator, you have -often posed questions for me to. think
about and this is another one that I think we Saute think
about together: that is the destruction of information. It
is also the destruction of evidence which might be used to show
abuses by the Bureau.

question --

Senator Mathias. I think what you suggest isa very per-
tinent, very current. consideration, that if you destroy all the
files, you can do more than all the perfumes of Arabie in washing
out the blood. i a :

Attorney General Levi. The guidelines do move-in‘that

direction. There is an argumeft about the time for the destruc
tion.of information.

Senator Mathias. There is a concurrent question: if file

are retained for any period of time, are they open for the pur-

‘pose of name checks during that period, which is a related

but really a separate question, for background checks, for .
employment checks, that kind of thing.

Attorney General Levi. Well you could have selective
sealing of files and I suppose selegtive destruction of items.
But it is a very difficult thing. -

Sénator Mathias. I would like to explore briefly your
thoughts on a subject we have discussed with other witnesses
at some tength.. And that is whether you believe that a
warrant requirement for beginning .a domestic .intelligence
investigation would meet the standards inthe Fourth Amendment
-if it required less. than. probable cause for the issuance of
a warrant, probable cause.to believe that a cyime has been or

was, about to occur.

I think the court would really wonder ‘why you want the

Senator Mathias. The intrusion of an informant, for
Seoacie! into a political discussion,. or any other activities
is a much greater intrusion than a bug or a wiretap in that
same conversation.

Now, would. this be, would the placement of an informant
be that kind. of. activity?

Attorney General Levi. Well, you.see, the preliminary
investigation does not really ‘allow new informants, so, as I
say, it is quite limited:

And I think we have to be grown up enough not to feel that

that there is a lack of protection. But I think a greater

protection is to’ curtail the scope of the investigations to

make sure that they are held to a high standard and to control

Senator Mathias. ‘Thank you very much.

‘The Chairman. Senator Mondale.

Senator Mondale. Thank.-you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Levi, I think the most faithful question that this
Committee, our Congress and our government must face is whether|
we are going. to step beyond the Stone line permitting investi-
gative a aT to go beyond matters of law enforcement, matters
of so-called “internal security.” i ;

If we decide that we must, then I am persuaded we should
only do. so baséd upon unarguable evidence that an exception
is needed arid. then to grant such an exception only under the
severest and closely defined standards, and, if possible, under
court supervision.

If we ‘fail to do that, I am convinced that this Committee
has failed and. that. in another.50 years, there will be hearings
just like this in which the. excesses that we have uncovered
will have been repeated.

And, I say that =: think. anything we do has to

stand the test of what we have learned. And what we heve

learned is that the power to use the police for politics is
a seductive and irresistable one. .No President; no attorney
general can resist it. Few have.

But we have now found that it is not a partisan issue. Th
Presidents of both political parties, a director who ant
under Presidénts of both political parties, they were absolutel
unable to resist the right to snoop into the private affairs of|
Americans not to enforce the law but in order to gain.some pol-|
itical advantage.

This is, I think if you leok at human history, this has
happened everywhere. Which is why we adopted the Bill of Right

The Federal Bureau of Investigation was set up precisely be-

cause it happened in World War I and we had the scandal of
the Palmer Raids and all the rest.

_ And when I aac at these vaguely defined guidelines, I
have to ask would they stand up under the direct orders to
the contrary from. a President of the United States. Would
they stand up in the .face of a willful director who is angry
or. hostile or suspicious about some of these political ideas,
the next Martin Luther King. _

My feeling is that based upon what we have learned, with-
out any doubt, if you swept away, as. quickly as a sand castle
being overrun by a hurricane, they would mean nothing.

What we decide to do cannot be tested by the words, but

by our notions of-how human nature works when empowered -in thig

way to play god with the American people.

That is the test and it has got to be tested by what
happens when the nation is in frenzy an in fear and it has
got to'be tested by what people do when they do not think they
are going to be caught.

And, for that reason; I see the step beyond'the ‘stone Steg
namely beyond the enforcement of the criminal law, is not a
~ step forward, but a step off a cliff, right back into the morass

that we find ourselves in today.

If you look at this record, it isa horrible one. I mean
the way Martin Luther King was hounded and harrassed isa
disgrace to every American. That this country once took all i
the Japanese and put them in internment camps we now khow is

- one of the blackest pages in American history. and it is that
kind of record that whatever we do has to be tested against.

And, I think for’ that reason we have to draw a line, the

. line that Judge Stone suggested, and if we do grant exceptions,
they have to be specifically and rigidly and unquestionably
drawn, because there is no point in talking about oversight

. if the standards are not understandable. :

And these laws have to be so clear that the Attorney
General and the director of the FBI would have to say when the
Pe dent-ca "I am sorry, Mr. President, but we cannot do
it, it is against the law.”

If they are not able to say that, I am convinced we will

2 from now, holding hearings similar to these.
18 Would you respond to that?
4 Attorney General Levi. Well, I think, like the Stone
5 statement, it a a good admonition. As I tried to-say in my

statement, I do not think the Stone standards indicates that

there should not be domestic security investigations because |

8 || the Stone standard talks about items within the proper juris-
9 diction of the Bureau.and violations of law and if you are going
10 to have an investigating agency which is going to be at all

iL responsible in those areas, they have to know some things which
12 |} are related, closely related to violations of particular kinds

13 of law.

14 And I do not believe that the standards that have been
15 @rawn up are as vague as your statement, perhaps, suggests, be-|
16 cause, when one uses the standard of ‘the stop and frisk case,

‘"_? that is the standard, very close and perhaps too close.
18 So, I think in terms of the Stone standard, it probably
19 meets it.

- i So. that I ‘am not sure that there is this big gap, .because|
21 this says specifically, “specific and articulable facts giving
22 reason to believe that an individual or individuals acting in

So -~ and I should remind you, as I know I do not have to,

that, as we said before, Congress has passed some rather broad
criminal statutes.
Senator Mondale. Oh, yes.”
Attorney General Levi. And the Stone standard is not
very meaningful if Sout as that.
‘ Senator Mondale. Well, the question now is once we know
~Wwhat-has happened, and we know the abuse that arises when peopl
have this unlimited, ill-defined power, what do we do if
possible to try to prevent its recurrence? That is the issue
that faces you. That is the issue that faces me and I am con-
vinced that guidelines written by the executive can be
rewritten by the executive, and if not by you, by those who
follow. And they will mean absolutely nothing against the will

of a willing president, a.willing attorney general, or a

willing director, absolutely nothing. because they do not have

the force of law.

2571,

Attorney General Levi. ‘There's no disagreement. I don't

think I should apologize for having ventured into the drafting,
into having the guidelines drafted. It seems to me that that
had to be done. I certainly do not take the position that
parts of them should not be put in statutory form, and I
certainly do not take the position that some of them should not

be put in Fxecutive Order form.

I think we ought to use all the devices, those devices
"where more permanence is wanted and those devices Sere there
might have to be changes from time to time.

Senator Mondale. ‘ow, Mr. Levi, are you persuaded that.

Senator Mondale. I mean, what were you trying to get
from him? Was that evidence of FBI improprieties? A record

Attorney General Levi. Yell, there are problems of
misbehavior, of what I would regard as misbehavior, or might

regard as misbehavior, and when one deals with matters of this

carry the same meaning.

I was.told when I came to the Department that the COINTHL

project had been completely reviewed and exposed. After I vas il
the Department, I discovered -- and I think partly as a result
of miscommunication to the Nirector -- that they had found
other items in the COINPELPRO project, and those vere reported
to this Committee aralles other Committees, but the point is
that. you might have projects which go beyond the confines of
the COINTEL project, which might still involve similar behavior.

“Senator Mondale. . But, I am asking you as the head of
Attorney General Levi. Well, I do not know if you can

or not, but we will certainly consider it. :
Senator Mondale. Why not?.

» Attorney General Levi. Because I think that it is one
thing to give reports of that kind-in confidence to a Committee
of this kind and another thing to make them public.

Senator Mondale. The CIA gave theirs to us. Why cannot
you?

Attorney General Levi. Well, I am not in Thene caja.
do not care to be. I do not wish to be.

Senator Mondale, Do you consider that a good answer?

Attorney General Levi. I -- yes, I consider the answer

as good as the question.



Senator Mondale, Well, I think that kind of arrogancé
is. why we have trouble between the Executive and the Legislativd
Branch, Thank you, ‘tr. Chairman.

The Chairman, I understood Senator Hondale's question to
be whether you would furnish certain docunents to the Committee,“
not if you wished them to be made public or not that he was
asking that the Committee make them public. I do not know
that we have had any problem in the past with the Nepartment

in getting information of this kind.

Attorney General Levi. I apologize to Senator Mondale if

I appeared arrogant. I thought that somebody else was appearin
arrogant, but I apologize.

The point is that if you ask agents to report on what. they
may think is misconduct, if they think that that is going to

be made public, that would, I believe, to be very chilling.

I, personally, have no reason to not want to give it to a

Committee if it is to be kept in confidence, I do not know
what the Bureau's position on that would be, .and my relationship
with the Bureau is that I like to discuss these matters with
them before giving a definitive answer oe ce I am not that
arrogant.

The Chairman. Well, leaving all personal references aside,
I think that you know that when this Committee has asked and
received information in confidence, it has kept the confidence.

Attorney General Levi. And we have tried very hard to give

2 The Chairman. So that ought not to be any problem, and I

3 would appreciate vour following up Senator Mondale's request

“2 because I regard it as an important one and not a frivolous

5 one, and in that connection let me say just before we move ‘on

6 to further questions that sometime ago, in early August, you

a sent a letter to me in which you requested from the Committee |

8 this seems appropriate now because it is a request in reverse -+

13 || you will recall, we met shortly later -~ and I think Judge

14 Tyler was present, and I was present at the time -- and’ this .

15 subject was touched upon, and I said that the Committee wanted

16 || te cooperate in making available whatever information we could

17 that would be helpful to the Department and that there would be

1g || 2 follow-up in which Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers would

corroborate with representatives of your Department to. find

out the best way for proceeding to implement the dustice

Department's request.

ies matters, including Dr, Martin Luther King matter and the Chilean]

matter.

I simply want to assure you, as a matter of public record,
that the Committee, having considered this earlier request,
fully willing to cooperate in any way, and we will see to
that procedures axe now worked out so that there will be

further delay. Our preoccupation with the assassination

investigation and the issuance of the Committee's report has

prempted our time, but we think that these requests are 7

and- we stand ready to work with the Justice Department in making
all relevant information available.

Attorney General Levi. I am delighted to have that assur-

ance.

The Chairman. Now, Senator Schweiker.

Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairnan.

Attorney General Levi, I an pleased to see that you have
announced this week the establishment of the office of
Professional Responsibility to aid in the oversight of the
investigations or allegations of misconduct by different
employees within the Department of Sat ae

I have been interested in something along this line for
some tine, and I commend you for taking this lead in this area.
I would just like to really asl oe a few questions about the

kind of concept that this is.

in terms of structure or organization?

Attorney General Levi. ‘Well, t ences may not be

as great as I thought they were when I ar.

2fted out this new

ordex Sut there are, I think, these differences, In the fir

dlace the Counsel will be in the office of Special Responsib
unlike the person who would be in the Office of Special Review.
We is in a position to directly receive complaints, and he is

in.a position then to directly’either refer them or to make .

a recommendation to me about then,

As I read the Office of Special Review, the holder of that
office would not have been in a position to receive complaints
unless the complaint was given to him by the Attorney Genoral
or the Deputy Attorney General. :

“tow, I thought that additional channel, while I hope it
will not be the major channel, was an important thing to keep
Shea! and, therefore, I wanted to make that clear. I also
wanted to enbody in this new order the experience that we have
had. We have called in-special groups to do investigating as
we did with the DEA when we organized a special team, and I
wanted to reflect in this order that there would be occasions
when the ordinary investigative practices would not be sufficier

I wanted to have the Counsel put in the position where he could

recommend that a special kind of review would be necessary thro

a different kind of a group, perhaps through a group assembled

by him, perhaps going outside of the Department.

it is stronger, and I felt we should make it stronger.

Senator Schweiker, Will this office have the authority
to go into, maybe, a pa review like the GAO progran audit,
or will it »e focused on primarily allegations of misconduct

on allegations of misconduct and on -- it will also focus on

so that it can recommend heyond ae and if it wishes to

Senator Schweiker, One of the things that came out this

we

k -- and I an not.sure that this would he subject to this
new connittee or office procedure or not -- but there has been
3 lot of discussion about the personal files of Mr. Hoover that
Helen Ganty had, and I would just like to read one paragraph

from the latest issue of "Tine" magazine that seems to show

a little bit of twist, if I understood it, because up until
now, as I understood it, there were mainly personal files that
Miss Ganty went through. 7
This latest edition says, “Before secretary Ganty could
look at Mr. Hoover's office, the files, the most eee
papers were carried off in an FBI truck to Nest Virginia's
Blue Mountain. Ridge Club, a Shennandoah Mountain hideaway used
by innermost FBI officials for regular poker games . the CIA
and other cronies. The papers a burned in the club's
large fireplace. Precisely who ordered this destruction and
carried it out has not.been disclosed. ~ The - three-story
clu worth. $300,000, was burned down in a fire of unknown cause
December 23rd. Ho evidence of arson has been discovered."

I guess my question here -- and maybe you have this under

investigation, I do not know, but this indicates to me, if it

tiated ._ @ feces _@ 2583
is true, and I do not know if it is’ true at all, some

FBI participation in terms of separating out so that even Miss
| Ganty could not see some of these files, and obviously somebody:
had to-make a decision, and obviously if the story is accurate,
they were destroyed. Can you shed any light on that, or is
this sonething that the Office of Professional Conduct would

be looking into or not?

Attorney General Levi. I have asked the criminal pivision
to investigate any and all of the items relating to the Depart-
ment of Justice which have come before this committee. And, of
course, one reason that they are rather anxious to get this
material, and this: certainly will be part of it.

Senator Schweiker, Can you give us any indication whether
that account is accurate at this point or not?

Attorney General Levi. Well, I really cannot because I
have to say that it does not -- it does not conform to my
memory of the documents that I have seen. But I cannot really ~
answer that question.

Senator Schweiker. On the matter of the office of Pro-
fessional Conduct, will it have the right to go in anywhere it |
feels it should go in terms of pursuing its job, as I under-
stood what you said? In other words, following an investiga-
tion, within the Department anywhere in the field so that it
should pursue it subject to what restrictions in that aspect?

“Attorney General Levi. I think it will. not be subject to
restraints. I think it may have to be subject to ee

Senator Schweiker. And it would have access to all of
the material in its original form if need be?
Attorney General Levi. I-think the negotiation. might be

some sensitive information which there vould be resistance to

giving and so on. But I think that anything it needed it

would get.

Senator Schweiker. Would material such as their reports,
would you envision that a new joint committee of Congress
charged with overseeing intelligence activities might have
access to that information or not?

“Attorney General Levi. Well, I think that is going to be
aepeaaene -~ that is a touchy subject because if it is going to
be public, then the way the material is obtained and the way it
is written about will be in a certain way, If it is going ‘to
be kept confidential, and we know it is going to be confiden-
tial, then there are less problems, oe not*sure.

Senator Schweiker. So as far as you are concerned, that

“is open to negotiation at this point in terms of working some-

thing out that would meet the guidelines you have in mind?

Attorney GenceaT Levi. Well, I” think so. There is no
joint committee at present, and of course, that is one of the
problems. Certainly one would hope that a reasonable ae
to what was being done would be available. But I do not
really believe ~- I do not really think that it is appropriate
for a joint committee to be on top of exploring the files of
the Bureau.

Now I know there is a great difference of opinion for cca
some members of the committee at least on that. I think that
is close to the line of managing the Bureau and I think .its

management really is not a legislative function. But certainly

5 to mandate the FBI or to second guess their investigation of

6 ongoing cases. But assuredly, it is part of the responsibility |

7 of the Congress to investigate wrongdoing and if we have reason

12 Attorney General Levi. Well it is like many of the ques-
13 tions. that we have discussed earlier. One has to be a

rr sensitive to. the limitations because if you have an open

15 investigation and there is the. possibility of any political

16 influence, either to act or not-act, then I get very upset at
17 the notion of thosé going to a congressional committee.

ae And I think everyone can understand that kind of problem.
19 so it has to be balanced.

20 Senator Schweiker. Well, Mr. Attorney General, I can.

21 understand protecting informants and protecting raw files, I
22 think that is legitimate. That is something that we would have
23 a responsibility in the Congress to-do. But I do have trouble,

24 assuming that can be worked out, and I think that is a very

25 important point, particularly from the administration of the

Department of Justice and the FBI, But assuming that can be
worked out, I do not see how you can possibly be protected; tha
what we just saw happen in the last 30 years will not happen
again, and that your inspection force will work, or that any
oversight committee will work unless we do have that kind of
prerogative,

On the basis that I outlined, it just seems to me we are

sort of deluding ourselves in view of what has happened, not to

have that access, ‘first for you, but secondarily for some
responsible element of the Congress that would be guided by
certain Tapa stoma protecting that.

Attorney General Levi. My only suggestion is that it may
be that the Attorney General should be able te see things vhich| -
the congressional committee ought not to see. And I just think
we have to think that through. Théré are stages. They are-
all problems of peivaey They are all problems of exposing
individuals to eae I think we have to take all that into
consideration.

Senator Schweiker. that is all I have.

The Chairman. If we had not had access to the raw files,
we would never have discovered the FBI's plan to discredit
“Mr. King and pick his ec secoe! And you recognize the
responsibility of this committee and we have worked out pro-
cedures which have enabled us to reach this basic evidence-in

ways that did not reveal informants or did not reveal agents.

And I think the guidelines of that kind could be worked out
between a permanent oversight committee and then Attorney
Generals so that the committee could get its job done. So I
really do not believe that the problem is insuperable, and the
fact that we have been able to get to the raw files when we :
needed to demonstrates that it can be done. |

Senator Hart?

Senator Hart (Colorado). Mr. Attorney General, I would

like to pursue this last question one minute further, and that

has to do with raw files. It is my understanding that in the

recent GAO inquiry into Bureau activities that they worked

almost exclusively, if not totally exclusively, from Bureau or

Departmental summaries. Is that correct, in their investiga-
tion?

Attorney en iei Well, that is what I understand.

Senator Hart (Colorado). And what you are saying here
today is that in the future, if there is established an over-
sight, a permanent oversight congressional committee, that
your recommendation would be that raw files reporting under

some restrictions would be available; that it would be the

same guidelines and the same kinds of investigation that the
Gao does.

Attorney General Levi. - I did not mean to assert that it
would have to be based on summaries. No, I did not. I just

think we have a problem as to the proprieties of what the

Docld:32989560 Page 67



e * 2589

ac joint committee -- if there is a joint committee -- would want,
“2! and what we should appropriately give.

3 I have to say that there might be a temptation on the

4a part of our Department of Justice to give more than it wanted
5 to, and in later years that might be a problem. So one has ite
6 balance that.

v7 Your committee, this committee did not ask for all of the
8 King files. And I rather suspect: that this committee had the

9 same, to some extent at least, the same feelings of sensitivity

10 || and propriety which I had when I said I did not want to look at
11 || them because there are materials there which I really think

12 || should be regarded as secret. And that is the kind of problem
13 || one has to get into.

14 Senator Hart (Colorado), But as a basic proposition, you

15 ate willing to go beyond that to ‘sortie degree?’

16 Attorney General Levi. Yes, I am. Of course the Bureau
17 || might not like the idea.

18 | Senator Hart (Colorado). Oh, I am sure they will not.

19 Yesterday I asked Director Kelley about the letter we

20 received from one of your Sees a Mr. Pottinger, in connec-
a tion with investigation of the King case internally. And he

22 asked us for FBI records and documents, all materials was I

“23 think the phrase he used. -The Director seemed somewhat
puzzled by that; but I guess’ my question is: why is the

25 Justice Department contacting this committee for FBI records?

Attorney General Levi. Well, I cannot imagine why, unless

you were given the only copies.

Senator Hart (Colorado). I would be surprised if that

happened.

Attorney General Levi. But.if the suggestion is that he
can only get them that way, and not directly from the Bureau,

I think that is really incorrect because it just happens: that I
have specifically asked Mr. Pottinger whether he had access to
“all the materials and he said yes. But it may be that our form
‘of record keeping is such that you have things where we do not

Know where the copies are, and you have a great deal of material.

‘Senator Hart (Colorado). But you have no doubt that you
will get everything the .FBI has on this matter?

Attorney General Levi. I have no doubt that eooote
investigating it for me will get everything the FBI knows that
it has.

As you know, it is possible that there are materials in
other files somewhere,

Senator Hart (colorado) . Well, I am talking about
conscious withholding.

Attorney General Levi. I do not believe there will be

* conscious withholding,

Senator Hart (Colorado). If or when you depart from the

Department of Justice, will you do so with any degree of fear

of an overly independent FBI in the future? Leaving aside the

question of the relationship that exists now, but is it a mattez

of concern to you about your successors;,.that the Bureau is too
independent of the Attorney General?

Attorney General Levi. Well, I have already said that I
think that there is a certain amount of distance and indepen-
dence. It-is probably desirable. But, of course I am concerned,
of course I am concerned. I am concerned not only about the
future but today. ‘

Senator Hart (Colorado). And therefore you would suggest
that Congress ought to also be concerned about that?

i Attorney General Levi. I have said so. I agree.

Senator Hart (Colorado) . In connection with these guide-
Lines that we are talking about, as you know one of the very
puzzling areas that this committee is in is thé Huston Plan,
Operation CHAOS and so on, back in the “60s and early '70s;
the tendency on the part of both the Department and the Bureau
arid many in ‘the White House to fear that. domestic protest
groups, particularly in connection with matters of race or
the Vietnam War, had some outside or foreign domination or
guidance or direction or support.

What,do you think preei guidelines should say for the
future about separating Soaaine domestic, domestically :
oriented and controlled protest that is legitimate and consti-

tutional, from the kind of official governmental harrassment

that did in fact go on with very, very little substantial



e « 2592,

support for the proposition that it was foreign dominated? What!
can be done about that in the future?

Attorney General Levi. It is terribly difficult for the
very reason of your last phrase, .in which you correctly empha-
sized that we do not have the guidelines on the foreign dominat .

‘ organizations; The question is how close one can come to
barring evidence of that domination when the purpose of the.
investigation in some sense has to be to obtain that very data.
So I suppose that one would try to-do is to use some kind of a
likely standard or something of that sort as-one approaches it
and then a reason to believe or some such thing which we have |}
come to temporarily on the domestic security ones, the stop and
frisk standard which is a pretty stringent standard for inves-

. tigation.

But I think there is a problem.

pit Hart (Colorado). But not with judicial approval;

I think that is your strong recommendation?

Attorney General Levi. I° do not whether it is strong or

not.

Senator Hart (Colorado). It is consistent.

Attorney General Levi. I just do not think that is the
most desirable path, I think it puts an enormous burden on
the court. I do not know how the court will exercise it. f
: doubt if it is the best way. But it may be one way.

where you as the ultimate decision maker as to whether a wire-

tap should be implanted and surveillance, all of it, and the
rights of the individual who would be jeopardized, the consti-
tutional rights of that individual or that group would be

jeopardized by the proposed surveillance, wiretapping or what-

"ever, what would be your own personal judgment on that where
there was an absolutely even question; there was no question
constitutional rights would infringed upon or even violated,

ean yet the balancing consideration was that there might be
some evidence of criminal activity or subversion or whatever?

Would you come down on the individual or group's side, or
the other way?

Attorney General Levi.” Well, I must believe that there
is a misunderstanding between us because I do not authorize
anything where .I think there is a violation of constitutional -
el So I think I must be misunderstanding.

Senator Hart (Colorado). Well, I am trying to get inside
the mind of an individual who is going to have this eutioe ites
“that you do not want an officer of the plu to have, about what
outweights what, where you do not know what information you are
looking for, and the Bureau agent is recommending a-wiretap or
a mail search and he is just saying I think there may be some
evidence here that we might need, and so on and so forth.

Senator Hart (Colorado). Do you resolve differences in
favor of the individual?

Attorney General Levi. I do want to say something about
the hypothetical. In this first place, under Title III, the
wiretaps -is judicious and the legislation that we are drafting
on electronic surveillance which is not a Title III matter, we
are suggesting because of reasons which I think I stated. before

But I do not know -of a present authorization which would permit
me to, without a warrant, authorize the opening of mail. Sol
think one has’ to weigh: the individual rights very seriously and

suggesting by my answer that in those particular hypotheticals
that the decision would be made without -- or could be made or
would be made without judicial review because I think in those
particular.examples there would be a warrant -- there would
have to be a warrant.

Senator Hart {Coloradd). Well, I am talking about the
area where there are no warrants. But I cannot frame the

hypothetical clearly enough.

- Attorney General Levi. Well, it has been framed in terms
of the use of informants; and where I do not think there should
be a warrant, and there is not a warrant, as far as I know, and
there does not have to be, in terms of constitutional equities
ments, at least at the present time. JI think one does have to
. be very sensitive. I think Stone was correct and if you are
_going to have an agency of this kind, and it is going ‘to
survive with the proper discipline and so on, it has to be
extremely sensitive to individual rights.

The Chairman. Senator Hart, ao you have further questions

Senator Hart (Michigan). Yes, Mr. Chairman, on specifics
really.

going back and forth with you and with others earlier on the

This morning you indicated that sone of the guidelines
might well be in statute and others in regulation, and you
suggested Executive Orders, and that gets to the point that
even in the area where statutory definition of guidelines is
appropriate, no matter how skilled the drafter, it will leave
unanswered certain things. 50, it also will have to be imple--
mented by Departmental ordersand guidelines, making even more
explicit the dos and donts and safeguards,

we do by statute, be subject to debate and approval, at least

by the Oversight Committee, which everybody assumes we_will

can involve debate and, hopefully, it will involve approval,,

tional questions, and I really do not know why one would want

king about not the problen of damages so much, as to the
problem of controls on the operation of the Department, and
I was looking at it fron that standpoint. I think there is
a problem about damages, There is a problem about the right
of people who may have been injured and whether they should
be notified, and I, frankly, do not know the answer to that
_question..

Senator Hart (Michigan). I would suggest that the Depart-
ment ought not make the judgment as to whether, to use your
expression, it had no consequence to the Subject. ay think that
that would be a decision that more correctly should be made by
the subject in his mind, and not the Department of Justice, as
you go through that file.

I would hope there could be a resolution of which you
would say to be the right answer.

Attorney General Levi. I have thought of suggesting the
Congress establish some kind of a claims division. But, in any
event, it is something we are thinking about,

Senator Hart (Michigan). Well, I hope we can come out of
this with some teeth in what we do because — suggest perhaps
exriminal penalties would not be very effective, ana you
describe the difficulties that attach to civil aia eae
you suggest that no matter how carefully drafted --

Attorney General Levi. Well, there are civil penalties

now, but I hate to think that, if guidelines are drafted and *

is a violation of one of the guidelines, that the consequence
is a criminal penalty. Somehow or other that seems to me
an inappropriate way.

Senator Hart (Michigan) . It would not be a criminal

' penality unless the person knowingly took action in violation

of the guidelines. And if you are paid by the taxpayer, why

should you not be subject to sanctions of that kind?

Attorney General Levi. I do not really see why payment

Senator Hart (Michigan). Well, .why should you not be

Attorney General Levi, I think my problem is that I think
you have problems of.discipline in any organization, and I think
one ought to be careful not to cover the field of administra-
tive. discipline in a government with criminal *‘penalitives which
I think is self-defeating. So, that is the only reason.

The Chairman. Just two subjects, Mr. Attorney General,
and then I am finished, and I will conclude the hearing.

Yesterday I asked Director Kelley about the amount of
time and money and general imposition on the overall per
of the FBI that was’ represented in the many investigations they
xoutinely make that deal with appointees or nominees, and
people being considered for Aare employment. And he said he
would supply those figures and give us some idea of how much of
the workload this represented. i

It is my understanding that the FBI does these investiga-
tions only for sensitive civilian jobs, and wherever a name
check digs up information from FBI files indicating a possible’
security risk. In other words, the FBI name check is there if
there is an allegation in the FBI files that a person might
have once been associated with a subversive or. extremist

organization or something like that, or if the position to

which the nominee is to be appointed is regarded as sensitive.
Then the FBI does the investigation of the nominee. Otherwise,
it is done by the Civil Service Commission.

I am wondering if when it comes to guidelines, that not
sought to be a good place to look pretty carefully to see how
much of this is really necessary. My impression in the past
has been that there are many FBI checks being done for posi-

tions"that could not possibly be regarded as sensitive as far

as national security is concerned, and maybe we just have over-
done this back in the period when we were terribly frightened,
in the McCarthy years, and it has never been looked at
sufficiently since to see if it still is all that necessary.

Attorney General Levi. Well, I agree and a good place to
begin is with the executive order that has been modified many
times on suitability for employment.

The Chairman. I do not know whether it is feasible to try
to legislate here, or whether there could he a way that legi-
slation might be helpful as a part of the basic or generic FBI
law that we hope to draw up.concerning this phase of the FBI's
activities. But I wish you would give some thought to that,
would you please?

Attorney General Levi. Surely.

The Chairman. The other matter that I want to deal with
is that time and time again in our investigation of the intelti|

gence agencies, including the intelligence aspect of the FBI's

i @ ings re any
work and the counterintelligence aspects, we are up against
the problem of accountability. And with the FBI, of course, we
have had the additional question of the president putting the
agency to his personal or political use; and a difficulty which
I think Senator Mondale rightly referred to -- the difficulty,
no matter what the regulations may be, and even perhaps
contrary to positions of the law, of refusing to do the presi-
dent's bidding. You know, the order of the president or the
desire of the president can be easily rationalized or some kind
of plausible excuse can be given for it that it sounds like it
might fall within the purview of the law.

And neither an attorney general or a qiveceee of the PBI
is in very much of a position.to argue with the president. And
then there is a feeling of who is going to find about it any-
‘way.

I asKed Director Kelley yesterday if he thought that
orders should be transmitted to him from the president through
the attorney general; and secondly, if orders are transmitted
to him to undertake an investigation.in which the president has
.expressed some interest, they ought to come in writing, and a
permanent file be kept so that the accountability is there
for review of-a congressional committee or for whatever.

He said that he thought that such directives should be in
writing and that a file, a permanent. file of then should be kept]

I would like to ask you how you would respond to those

questions. And I put the questions in this order: first, do
you think that if the president wants the FBI to go out and mak
an investigation for him and report back to him, that that
order should be transmitted through the attorney general? and
secondly, whether you think orders of that character coming
from the president should take the form of a written order and
permanently maintained in the files of the Bureau? ;

Attorney General Levi. Well, I think a orders probably
should be written. Now as to the first part of your question,
the hypothetical case’ might be that the president has decidea
that he wishes to appoint a certain person to the cabinet and
he wishes a full field investigation. - Under the guidelines,
the president, the counsel to the president or associate
counsel could ask the Bureau to do that.

I would think, unless there ie cou particular reason,
that the attorney general should be notified as to what is
going on. I think any suggestion of any other kind of investi-
gation of an organization or something of that sort, which I
thought you were suggesting, should not come from the president
to the director, in any case, and if it did come, it certainly
should come in writing and the attorney general should be
notified.

I certainly do not want to say that the president cannot
: speak to anybody he wants to speak to and there is no reason’

why he should not be talking to members of the Department of

Justice. I do think it is a desirable thing when that occurs,
unless it is discussing the criminal activity of the eaeey
general, that the attorney general be notified.

Now I think in fact, at the present time, and I maybe I
would be the last one to know, but I think the cian ieation.
are through the attorney general, except for the kind of inves-
tigations for Pere ere which might or might not come to me.

The Chairman. But it is possible au that too might
ba the subject of that kind of procedure, the very kind you have
outlined can be the subject of a statute. And if it were, do
you think the president-would be bound by’ it?

Attorney General Levi. Oh, he might not be, but in fact
he would, I would think, wish.to.adhere to it and ib vould
make it easier for others to suggest that there was kind eS a
propriety about it.

The Chairman. Before you leave, and I want to express the

want to say that Mike Shaheen, who has been the liaison with

quite busy and would not be able te see him immediately.
The only information Epstein gave as to the reason for
wanting te interview Magee was to get information about the
early organization of the FBI Laboratory. There followed
some further telephone calls between the two but they never
got together for an interview at that time. However,
Epstein again called Magee early during the week nf 12/28/75
and asked Nagee te appear for interview Tuesday, 1/6/76.
The only information Upstein gave as to the subject matter
of the interview was that it would be about the operations
of the Bureau. Magee agreed to appearing for the interview.

It was explained to Magee that the same procedura
relative to an SSC interview would apply as that for one of
the HSC, and it was suggested that immediately after completing
the conversation with Phillips, Magee telephone the Legal
Counsel Division for further information, particularly as
to waiver of the confidentiality agreement he has with the
Bureau. Magee said that he would immediately call
Mr, Mintz’ office.

AS a matter of intercst, Magee also advised that,
when he was first contacted by Epstein September last, he
asked Epstein where the latter had gotten his nama and
Epstein said it was from Bill Sullivan, Magee then told
Phillips that he could just not understand some of the things
which he has been learning about Sullivan and he expressed
dismay at some publicized reports that Sullivan had been
making statements derogatory to the Bureau and the late
Mr. Hoover. Mazee said that at the time former Acting
Director L. Patrick Gray left the Bureau, and before
Mr, William D, Ruckelshaus was named to succeed him,
Sullivan contacted Magee. Sullivan told Magee that he,
Sullivan, fully intended to become FBI Director and that,

RE: GARY THOMAS ROWE

; At 11:00 a.m., November 21, 1975, Special Acent
NEIL P. SHANAHAN of the Philadelphia Division of the FBI
was interviewed under oath by two staff members of the
above styled committee in the Old Senate Office Building
in Washington, D.c. Present during the interview and
doing most of the questioning was Mr. ROBERT KELLY, and
Mr. JOUN BAYLY, who identified themselves as staff

tee {(Ss8c).

Prior to any questioning, it was explained by

- Mr. ROBERT KELLY that SA SHANAHAN would be testifying
‘ yoluntarily and that he had a right to be represented by

counsel if he so Gesired. Also prior to any questioning,

‘Mr. KELLY explained that he had previously interviewed

GARY THOMAS ROWE, a former confidential informant. f
FBI and would be asking questions prompted by ‘in£o}
furnished to him by Mr. ROWE.

After responding to questions of a general
informative nature, such as when SA SHANAHAN handled
Mr. ROWE, and the general dates of Mr. SHANAHAN's

. employment and assignments with the FEI, certain specific

areas were covered and recalled by SA SHANAHAN as foht cues

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

A question was asked concerning activities
‘taken by SA SHANAHAN upon receipt of information from
Mr. ROWE that the Ku Klux Klan was going to immediately
engage in some form of violent activity. SA SHANAHAN
responded that upon receipt of such information, it was
immediately reported to his superiors, and evaluated to
determine what immediate action, such as dissemination
to local authorities, etc., was required. A question
was asked in thic wrea directly on the issue of whether
anyone in the FBI instructed Mr. ROWE to engage in any
violent activities. Mr. SRANAHAN responded that at no
time did he, or anyone else to his knowledge, instruct
Mr. ROWE to engage in any violent activity. in fact,
he was often instructed to avoid engaging in violent
activity.

At one point in the interview, Mr. JOHN BAYLY ©
asked questions concerning whether SA SHANAHAN could
express his opinion as to the morality or ethics involved
an certain activities which Mr. ROWE had reported.that he
-had engaged in. This question was xre-phrased several times
by Mr. BAYLY because of SA SHANAHAN's reveated statements
that he did not understand the extent of the information
sought by Mr. BAYLY.

Another eritical areacf questioning dealt with

“a statement made by Mr. ROWE that at some time during
. the trials of three members of the Ku Klux Klan, for

killing Mrs. VIOLA LIUZZ0, he had advised Mr. JOHN DOAR,
Assistant Attorney General, -that they. had been introducing
testimony from one Mr, LEROY MOTON, who was identifying
himself under oath as the man present in the automobile
with Mrs. LIUZZO0 when she was shot. Mr. ROWE had advised
Mr. DOAR that Mr. MOTON was not the same man who was in
_the auto with Mrs. LIUZZO when she was shot. In response

NW_S5110__Doocld: 32989560 Page 101



UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

to these questions, Mr. SHANAHAN testified that Mr. ROWE
had at some point during these trial proceedings, seen
either in person or a photograph in the newspaper of

Mr. LEROY MOTON, and had advised Mr. SHANAHAN that this
man was not the same man he had seen riding in the car
with Mrs. LIUZZO. At the next opportunity, Mr. SHANAHAN
contacted Mr. JOHN DOAR and had Mr. ROWE relate to Mr.
DOAR his opinion concerning the identity of LEROY MOTON
as the man present in the car with LIUZZO. Mr, SHANAHAN
further testified that he did not know what, if any,
impression this had on Mr. DOAR and the further content
of the trial.

At a point the interview appeared to be over
and Mr. KELLY and Mr. SHANAHAN conversed off the record,
during which conversation Mr. KELLY related that Mr. ROWE
had currently had some difficulties with Mr. DOAR and the
Department of Justice after the FBI had relocated him in
another part of the country and that some of the statements
being made by Mr. ROWE concerned his treatment by the
Department of Justice after he was no longer under FBI
control. Mr. SHANAHAN mentioned that he recalled that
GARY THOMAS ROWE received a written agreement signed by
Attorney General NICHOLAS D. KATZENBACH, which outlined
what agreement would exist between Mr. ROWE and the
Department of Justice. Mr. KELLY asked Mr. SHANAHAN to
go back on the record and relate this under oath, which
was done. Mr. SHANAHAN testified only that he had been
present during negotiations between Mr. ROWE and Mr.

DOAR about this agreement and had seen the agreement
furnished to Mr. ROWE prior to Mr. ROWE's testimony during
the Federal trial in Montgomery, Alabama.

POSTAL Specifically, what instructions did you
give her?
LASH I told her to become a member of the

Buffalo Chapter of the VVAW in order
that she might gather information
concerning violent or radical activities
engaged in by the organization.

POSTAL What specifie area was Miss Cook assigned
to work in?

LASH Initially she became a member of the
women's group of the VVAW.

POSTAL Was this group of the VVAW engaged in
any specific type of activity at the time?

LASH I believe at this point in time they
were trying to develop various 7
programs they could implement in the future.

POSTAL Did you tell her she was to obtain
background information concerning
individuals in the group?

LASH I told her to obtain information concerning
members of the VVAW.

POSTAL What do you mean by "a member?"

LASH The VVAW did not have membership cards

as such, however, I considered a

person who attends meetings of the Chapter
or gives financial. or other support to be
a member of the organization.

POSTAL What type of background information did
she obtain?

LASH She obtained physical descriptions and
other types of background information
such as residences or employment which
would allow me to differentiate between
that individual and other individuals
in the Buffalo area.

Did you have her provide any other
information concerning individuals
in the organization?

I asked her to identify those individuals
who had a capability of engaging in
radical or violent activities.

What is the difference between violent
and vadical activities?

Radical activities that are not violent
are those which are illegal or infringe
upon the rights of other citizens.

Did you have another Agent present with
you when you recruited Mary Jo Cook?

Yes, I did.

For what reason?

It is a FBI regulation that two Agents
be present during initial interviews
with female informants.

Did this Agent become a handling Agent
of Mary Jo Cook?

No, he did not. He was merely present
during the initial interview.

When did you first contact Mary Jo Cook?
June, 1973

Did Mary Jo Cook attend meetings of the
VVAW with her boyfriend, whose name we
shall not mention?

I believe she did.

Did she and her boyfriend ever give
joint reports?

I can not discuss that matter within
the scope of this inquiry.

Miss Cook stated that the objectives of
the VVAW were as follows:

To end the war in Viet Nam, to obtain
better veteran's benefits, to upgrade
bad conduct discharges, to obtain
drug treatment for veterans. Is this
correct?

I believe they embraced those objectives
but they also had others.

What were the other objectives?

As she described them, the destruction of
U. S. imperialism and the replacement of
our form of government with a socialist
government, probably modeled after the
government of Red China.

Did the VVAW ever engage in violent
activities?

Yes.
Could you cite some examples?

The first meeting she attended, for
example, concerned the planning of a
disruption of a U. S. Marine Corps
Armed Forces Day display in Buffalo. On
other occasions actions were planned
which were illegal and disruptive.

Can you gives any examples of violent
activities by individual members?

I recall on one occasion several members

in this organization told Miss Cook

that they felt the actions of an individual

who was arrested for a bombing on the
University of Michigan campus, which resulted in
death, were justified for political purposes.

Do you know of any violent activities
that VVAW members actually engaged in
since the foregoing could possibly be
rhetoric?

VVAW have physically assualted members of other

subversive groups in the Buffalo area.

Miss Cook has indicated that you told
her that you were interested in attempts:
by other groups to take over the VVAW.
Did this ever happen?

According to information provided by
Miss Cook, the Revolutionary Union
(Characterization of which is contained
in appendix hereto) was attempting to
take over the VVAW. I was interested
in this.

What is the Revolutionary Union?

The Revolutionary Union is a Maoist
subversive group.

Was the Revolutionary Union attempting
to take over the Buffalo Chapter?

According to Miss Cook, they were’ trying
to take over chapters in several areas

of the country and she said that they were
taking over the New York City chapter,
however, I cannot recall specific attempts
to take over the Buffalo chapter while

I was handling Miss Cook.

Did the Revolutionary Union ever take
over the VVAW?

I cannot answer that within the scope
of this inquiry.

Did you consider the VVAW to be a
subversive organization?

Yes
Do you know anything about "Cointelpro"?

by Mary Jo Cook in any cointelpro-type
activities such as getting members of
VVAW fired from their jobs or telling
the parents of members?

LASH No I did not.
POSTAL Did you ever take any actions against
. Mary Jo Cook or her family?

LASH No I did not.

POSTAL Did you ever engage in any disruptive
or neutralizing action against the
organization?

LASH I engaged in no disruptive activities,

however, if I learned that the organization
was planning something illegal I would

alert the local authorities and sufficient
police officers would appear at the scene to
prevent trouble. I feel this neutralized any
planned illegality by the VVAW.

POSTAL Did Miss Cook ever provide you with
mailing lists of the organization?

LASH Miss Cook provided me with any number of
lists, whether they were described as
mailing lists or membership lists, I
cannot recall.

was getting funds from foreign sources?

LASH No.

POSTAL What did you do with the names that

were contained on these lists?

LASH I would review the lists to determine
if there was anything significant

provided me with a lot of material that
I had no interest in.

POSTAL Did she ever provide you with a

defense pamphlet? 4
LASH Not that I can recall
POSTAL Did she ever give you any information

concerning VVAW defense strategies?

Today" and from a magazine called,
"Counter Spy" and other information of
that nature.

POSTAL Did she tell you that she was working
with the Attica Defense Committee?

LASH Yes

POSTAL What is the Attica Defense Committee?

as individuals seeking their own ends |
have gotten together.

POSTAL Did Miss Cook ever indicate that the |
VVAW was a conduit of mail between
the Attica Defense Committee and prisoners

in order to get letters in and out of

Did you ever give any information she
provided to the Attica prosecutors?

None whatsoever

Did you ever give any kind of information

to others outside the FBI?

I would pass on information concerning
demonstrations, rallies, etc. to the
local authorities.

Did she ever talk about demonstrations
in the courtroom itself?

Not that I can recall.

Did she ever provide logistical
type information concerning Attica
demonstrations?

Yes, on one occasion she was even
a "parade marshal" at a demonstration.

Was there ever any violence at Attica
Defense Committee Demonstrations?

On one occasion another group which was
marching in a demonstration planned

to march out of the parade and trash

the Chase Manhattan Bank in Buffalo
provoking the police. This information
was brought to the attention of the police
and it did not occur. And as I recall,

I also told Mary Jo Cook about this

plan and might have prevented it from
happening.

Are any of the individuals who are actually
connected with the defense of the Attica
prisoners known to be violence-prone
individuals?

LASH I cannot answer that within the scope
of this inquiry

POSTAL What was the method of her providing
you with reports?

LASH She would provide me with information
either in person or by telephone, which
I would dictate to a stenographer, have
reduced to writing and have her sign.

POSTAL Did these reports contain background
information regarding individuals?

LASH Yes

POSTAL What type of background information?

LASH The same type I deseribed before, physical
data, place of employment, residence, etc.

POSTAL Did she give you follow-up data on this
background information?

LASH Yes. If a person changed his residence
or employment she would tell me.

POSTAL Did she make conclusions in her reports?

LASH She reported information factually,

however, I believe she did make conclusions
regarding the propensity for violence
for individuals in the organization.

POSTAL Miss Cook indicated that after a while
she began to give you reports wherein
several meetings would be reported in
one report if these meetings concerned
a central theme. Is this true?

LASH As best I can recall, Miss Cook gave me
reports on each individual meeting she
attended.

POSTAL Did you ever indicate to Miss Cook that
you had specific questions for her from

SELECT COMMITTEE ON

POSTAL She stated that on oceasion you provided
her with a list of questions which she
said came from Washington and sometimes
she did not understand the questions.

LASH On occasion I would ask her questions
7 about the organization. I never gave

her any list of questions that I said
came from Washington. On several
oceasions I told her, in response to
her questions, that the information she
provided was sometimes sent to Washington
since it pertained to VVAW nationally.
I pointed out that this should calm
her fears that the FBI might be
getting information from informants who
are not telling the true story about
the VVAW. I also pointed out to her
that her information being accurate
would in fact offset any mis-information
that might come from another informant.

POSTAL Did Miss Cook ever provide out of town
reports?
LASH Yes. Miss Cook traveled to other cities

and provided reports on activities in
these cities.

POSTAL | Was she provided with the names of Agents
and telephone numbers in these other cities.

LASH Yes she was.

POSTAL Was this so she could report to these

other Agents?

LASH No. She was given the number for
emergency purposes only, to be utilized
if she found out something that required
immediate attention or if she suffered
some personal emergency such as an
automobile accident, etc.

POSTAL During her trips to other cities and
attendance at conventions, did she
obtain any documents for the FBI?

LASH Yes.

POSTAL What was the nature of these documents?

LASH Any number of documents and handouts were
provided to the attendees at conventions.
Some of these were pamphlets describing
VVAW activities, copies of VVAW newspapers,
flyers concerning demonstrations and a aaa
in other VVAW chapters, etc.

POSTAL What was the method of payment for Miss Cook's
services?

LASH Miss Cook was paid on a COD basis for
information provided.

POSTAL Was she paid a salary?

LASH No

POSTAL What determined the amount that she was

paid monthly?

LASH She was paid on a monthly basis COD for
information provided. Inasmuch as she
provided a good deal of information every
month, she was usually paid the maximum
amount permitted by FBI Headquarters,
therefore monthly payments often totaled
similar amounts.

POSTAL Was she instructed to pay income tax?

LASH She was advised to treat all money
she received from the Bureau as income
and to pay appropriate taxes.

POSTAL Was she given any instructions on how
to report her income from the FBI?

LASH IT cannot recall giving her any specific
instructions, however, if I had I would
have instructed her to report it as
miscellaneous income or income from
self-employment, something of that nature.

POSTAL Were these instructions to conceal the
fact that she was receiving money from
confidential FBI funds?

UNITED STATES SENATE

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

LASH No. This would have been to conceal
the fact that she was an FBI informant.

POSTAL Did you get Mary Jo Cook a job?

LASH I aided her in finding employment.

POSTAL What were the circumstances?

LASH Miss Cook indicated that she was being

eriticized by members of her group

for being a "lumpen proletariat" (PH)
for not being gainfully employed.

This is a Marxist term for anyone
being supported by their parents

or Welfare, etc. She indicated that
it would be necessary for her to find,
a job and I contacted a social
acquaintance of mine who is employed
by a Buffalo area bank, who advised that
the bank is always looking for tellers.
I advised Miss Cook to go to the bank.
She did and she got a job as a teller.

POSTAL Did Mary Jo Cook feel she was an
Agent Provacateur?

LASH No. On the contrary, I feel if anything
she was a non-provacateur since I
instructed her to act in such a way as to
prevent any violent or illegal act that might
be discussed in her presence. I think she
understood this and acted in this way.

POSTAL Why did Mary Jo Cook act as an informant?

LASH Mary Jo Cook was an actual member of the

VVAW as well as being an informant for the
FBI. She reconciled this in her mind z
by feeling that she was providing

the FBI with information that was objective
and true about the organization, as well as
preventing violent individuals from taking
over the group. :

POSTAL What percentage of the group did you feet!
was violence prone?
LASH I do not think I can answer that.

You cannot give some approximation?

According to Miss Cook there were
individuals who were not interested at all
in violence, as well as individuals who were
interested in taking up the gun and

fighting in the streets as a defensive
measure assuming that.a violent revolution
would be started by the establishment.

There were also individuals who were
interested in initiating violence themselves
to bring about their political goals.

What percentage of the group each of

these factions represented, I cannot say.

Could you indicateé the number of
violent activities that the VVAW was
involved in during the period you
handled Mary Jo Cook?

I cannot recall.
Was it 2 or 25?
Between 2 and 25.

Mary Jo Cook indicated that the VVAW members
were the most loving and good people she

has ever met. Did she ever indicate that
=a. you?

Yes.

If she indicated that these people
were so loving and good, how did
you feel that they could engage in
acts of violence.

I do not mean to be facetious, but

I have read that the "Charles Manson
family" in California claim to love
each other and are very interested

in ecology and other good things.

But I believe they certainly seem

to be capable of engaging in violence.

POSTAL Miss Cook indicates that she felt
there were other informants in the
group. Did you ever discuss other
informants with her?

LASH On one occasion an individual came to Buffalo
from another part of New York state
who was suspected of being an informant.
The group wanted to take action against him,
however Mary Jo Cook told them they
should take no action, but rather should
check with VVAW members in his home area to
determine if he was an informant.
I believe at the time it was necessary
for me to ask her about this situation
immediately after it happened and she
therefore suspected we had other
informants in the organization.

POSTAL Did you indicate to her that if she
were to quit you would put other informants
in the organization who would possibly
not be as truthful about the VVAW
as she was?

LASH Yes. I believe I did indicate this to her.
POSTAL Why did she quit?
LASH Because she indicated that she was having

nightmares and suffering actual physical
afflictions due to her fears of being
discovered as an informant.

POSTAL She has indicated that she has had
long political discussions with you
where you disasereed with her on
political issues. Is this correct?

LASH Yes, this is correct.
POSTAL What prompted these discussions?
LASH She indicated on many occasions that

as a member of the VVAW she was only
hearing political perspective from the
far left. She asked that I present
her with an alternative perspective
which I attempted to do. I attempted
to point out that there are two sides

LASH to every question. For example,

(Cont. ) I recall on one occasion she was told
by the VVAW that Bethlehem Steel in
the Buffalo area had permitted a worker
to die rather than shut down a blast
furnace after a worker had fallen
down into the furnace area. I checked
on this and told her that the true story
was that the worker had had a fatal heart
attack before falling into the dangerous

7 area and that immediately after his fall
everything was shut down for his rescue.

POSTAL Did she indicate to you that she was
especially concerned about the atrocities
at Attica Prison?

LASH Yes, she did.

POSTAL Did you ever indicate to her that you
talked to someone who had been there
and said there were no atrocities?

LASH I indicated to her that I had talked
to a physician who had been there
after the rebellion had been put down
who had told me that the individuals
he treated had been injured during the
period the prison was in the hands of
the rebellious inmates and not during’
the suppression of the riot.

POSTAL Did she ever discuss political parties
with you?
LASH The only thing I can recall is her telling

me that at some time in the future the
VVAW will be a grassroots socialist party
in the United States.

POSTAL Did she mention an individual named
Martin Solestry (PH)?

LASH Do you mean Martin Sostre?

POSTAL Who is he?

LASH He is a prison inmate I believe in

Auburn Prison.

No

keep her as an informant?

On several occasions I convinced

her that she should remain an informant
but at the time of our last contact I
felt that she had truly made up her mind~
and I made no further attempt to convince
her to remain an informant.

Did it bother you that she was reporting
to you on the political activities of these
individuals?

Is it Bureau policy that informants report
on political activity?

Veterans Against the War/Winter Soldier Organization (VVAW/ naeer
WSO) in 1973 to include non-veterans as members), has spon=
sored numerous anti~government demonstrations, some resulting
in violence. The VVAW/WSO National Office (NO) and some key
chapters are infiltrated and influenced by the militant Revolu-
tionary Union (RU) organization, and VVAW/WSO leaders have told
members that VVAW/WSO is a revolutionary organization, not "just
another group of war veterans." The current Marxist-Leninist-
Maoist oriented NO, which promotes education of the membership

. in Marxist-Leninist-Maoist doctrine and directs the organization

i into political growth along the same lines, has at VVAW/WSO
National Steering Committee Meetings (Nsom , in 1974, portrayed
VVAW/WSO as _a mass anti-imperialist organization and a vanguard
of the revolution eventually created by the masses.

VVAW/WSO leaders voted at the December, 1974 NSCM to

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

The Revolutionary Union (RU), founded in early
1968 in the San Francisco Bay area, is a militant semi-
covert Marxist-Leninist revolutionary organization
ideologically oriented towards the People's Republic of
China and the teachings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung. Its
objectives as set forth in its theoretical publication,
"The Red Papers," and in its monthly newspaper, "Revolution,"
are the development of a united front against imperialism,
the fostering of revolutionary working class unity and
leadership in struggle, and the formation of a communist
party based on Marxism-Leninism-MAO Tse-tung thought, leading
to the overthrow of the United States Government by force
and violence. Members of the RU have been identified as
collecting weapons while engaging in firearms and guerrilla
warfare training. As of July, 1974, RU national headquarters
was located in Maywood, Illinois.

I welcome the interest which this Committee
has shown in the FBI and most particularly in’ our
operations in the intelligence and internal security
fields.

I share your high regard for the rights

guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United
States. Throughout my 35-year career in law enforcement
you will find the same insistence, as has been expressed

by this Committee, upon programs of law enforcement that -

are themselves fully consistent with law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of

legislative oversight. In fact, at the time my ‘appointment

as Director of the FBI was being considered by the Senate
Judiciary Committee two and one-half years ago, I told

the members of that Committee of my firm belief in

Congressional oversight.
This Committee has completed the most
exhaustive study of our intelligence and security

operations that has ever been undertaken by anyone

NW 55110 DocId:32989560 Page 130



NW 55110 DoclId:32989560 Page 131

outside.the FBI other than the present Attorney General.
At the outset, we pledged our fullest cooperation and
promised to be as candid and forthright as possible in~
responding to your questions and complying with your
requests.

r believe we have lived up to those promises.

The members and staff of this Committee have
had unprecedented access to FBI information.

You have talked to the personnel who conduct
security-type investigations and who are personally involved
in every facet of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

You have attended numerous briefings by FBI
officials who have sought to familiarize the Committee
and its staff with all major areas of our activities
and operations in the national security and intelligence
fields. ,

In brief, you have had a firsthand examination’ of
these matters that is unmatched at any time in the history
of the Congress. :

As this Committee has stated, these hearings
have, of necessity, focused largely on certain errors
and abuses. I credit this Committee for its forthright
recognition that the hearings do not give a full or

balanced account of the FBI's record of performance.



Ww 55110

It is, perhaps, in the nature of such hearings
to focus on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments
of the organization. ;

The counterintelligence Programs which have
received the lion's share of public attention and critical
comment constituted an infinitesimal portion of our over-
all work. ‘

A Justice Department Committee which was formed
last year to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's
Counterintelligence Programs has reported that in the
five basic ones it found 3,247 Counterintelligence proposals
were submitted to FBI Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this
total, 2,370 -- less than three-fourths -~ were approved.

I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247
proposals were being devised, considered, and many were
rejected, in an era when the FBI was handling an average
of 700,000 investigative matters per year.

Nonetheless, the criticism which has been
expressed regarding the Counterintelligence Programs
is most legitimate and understandable.

The question might well be asked what I had
in mind when I stated last year that for the FBI to have
done less than it did under the circumstances then existing
would have been an abdication of its responsibilities

to the American people.

DocId:32989560 Page 132



What I said then -- in 1974 ~- and what I believe
today, is that the FBI employees involved in these programs
aia what they felt was expected of them by the President,
the Attorney General, the Congress, and the people of
the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private

offices and buildings; rioters led by revolutionary
extremists laid siege to military, industrial, and
educational facilities; and killings, maimings, and
other atrocities accompanied such acts of violence
from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings --
men, women, and children. As is the case in time of peril -- i
whether real ox perceived ~- they looked to their Government,
their elected and appointed leadership, and to the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies to protect their lives, their

property, and their rights.

There were many calls for action from Members
of Congress and others, put few guidelines were furnished.
The FBI and other law enforcement agencies were besieged
by demands...impatient demands...for immediate action.

FBI employees Tesoguiiaca the danger; felt

they had a responsibility to respond; and, in good faith,

NW 55110 Docld:32989560 Page 133 ina Ata



initiated actions designed to counter conspiratorial-
efforts of self-proclaimed revolutionary groups, and
to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred
in the Counterintelligence Programs -- and there were
some substantial ones -- should not obscure the underlying
purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred
in the past ard will arise in the future where the
Government may well be expected to depart from its
traditional role -- in the FBI"s case, as an investi-
gative and intelligence-gathering agency -- and take
affirmative steps which are needed to meet an imminent
threat to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to
be carried out NOW, can we truly meet our responsibilities
by. investigating only after the crime has occurred, or
should we have the ability to prevent? I refer to those
instances where there is a strong sense of urgency because
of an imminent threat to human life.

Where there exists the potential to penetrate

and disrupt, the Congress must consider the question of

NW 55110 DoclId:32989560 Page 134 ~S-



Nw 55110 : DocId: 32989560 Page 135

@ : : r : &

whether or not such preventive action should be available
to the FBI.

These matters are currently being addressed
by a task force in the Justice Department, including the

FBI, and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and

controls can be developed in cooperation with pertinent
Committees of congress to insure that such measures are
used in an entirely responsible manner.

Probably the most important question here

“today is what assurances can I give that the errors
and abuses which arose under the counterintelligence
Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some
very substantial changes have been made in key areas of the
FBI's methods of operations since I took the oath of
office as Director on guly 9, 1973.

Today we place a ‘high premium on openness -~
openness both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open, frank
discussion in the decision-making process which
insures that no future program or major policy decision
will ever be adopted without a full and critical review

of its propriety.



iw 55110

Participatory management has become a fact
in the FBI.

I have made it known throughout our Headquarters
and Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, regardless
of position or degree of experience, to contribute their
thoughts and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms
or reservations they may have concerning any area of our
operations.

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine,
and I take full responsibility for them. My goal is to
achieve maximum critical analysis among our personnel without
in any manner weakening or undermining.our basic command
structure. ,

, The results of this program have been most
beneficial...to me personally...to the FBI's disciplined
performance... cand to the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the
past were’ occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities
outside the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward
Levi's guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability --
in his own words -- "as a ‘lightning rod' to deflect improper
requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General

Levi instructed that I immediately report to him any

DocId:32989560 Page 136



: requests or practices which, in my judgment, were improper
or which, considering the context of the request, I believed
presented the appearance of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I
have to the Attorney General that during my nearly two
and one-half years as Director under two Presidents and
three Attorneys General, no one has approached me or
made overtures -- directly or otherwise -- to use the
FBI for partisan political or other improper purposes.

I can assure you that I would not for a moment
consider honaring any such request.

; I can assure you, too, in my administration of
the FBI I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney
General and the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions,
including those which arise in my continuing review of our ,
operations and practices. These are discussed openly and
candidly in order that the Attorney General can exercise
his responsibilities over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the
FBI today is sound. But it would be a mistake to think
that integrity can be assured only through institutional
means.

Integrity is a human quality, It depends upon
the character of the person who occupies the office of

Director and every member of the FBI under him.

INW 55110 Docld:32989560 Page 137



=

I am proud of the 19,000 men and women with
whom it is my honor to serve today. Their dedication,
their professionalism, their standards, and the self-
discipline which they personally demand of themselves
and expect of their associates are the Nation's ultimate
assurance of propper and responsible conduct at all times
by the FBI.

The Congress and the members of this Committee
in particular have gained a great insight into the problems
confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields --
problems which all too often we have been left to resolve
without sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch.or
the Congress itself.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment
have been made. But no one who is looking for the cause
of our failures should confine his search solely to the
FBI, or even to the Executive Branch.

The Congress itself has long possessed the
mechanism for, FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been
exercised.

An initial. step was taken in the Senate in
1973 when the Committee on the Judiciary established

a Subcommittee on FBI Oversight. Hearings had been

NW 55110 DocId:32989560 Page 138



‘ul 55110 Docld:32989560 Page 139 - 10

commenced, and we were fully committed to maximum
participation with the members of that subcommittee.
: I laud their efforts. However, those efforts
are of very recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.
One of the greatest benefits of the study
this Committee has made is the expert knowledge you have
gained of the complex problems confronting the FBI. But
I respectfully submit that those benefits are wasted if
they do not lead to the next step -- a step that I believe
is absolutely essential -- a legislative charter, expressing
Congressional determination of intelligence jurisdiction for
the FBI.
Action to resolve the problems confronting us
in the security and intelligence fields is urgently needed;
and it must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither
the Congress nor the public can afford to look the other
way, leaving it to the FBI to do what must be done, as
too often has occurred in the past.
This means too that Congress must assume a
continuing role, not in the initial decision-making
Heroes’: but in the review of our performance.
I would caution against a too-ready reliance
upon the Courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some
proposals that have been advanced during these hearings

would extend the role of the Courts into the early stages

i
|
i
i



of the investigative process and, thereby, would take
over what historically have been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked,
would seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary
and cast them in a role not contemplated by the authors
of our Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a
substitute for Congressional oversight or Executive
decision.

The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable
determination of our jurisdiction in the intelligence
field, a jurisdictional statement that the Congress finds
to be responsive to both the will and the needs of the
American people.

Senators, ‘first and foremost, I am a police
officer -- a career police officer. In my police experience,
the most frustrating of all problems that I have discovered
facing law enforcement in this country -- Federal, state, or
local -- is when demands are made of them to perform
their traditional role as protector of life and property
without clear and understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a
legislative charter will be a most precise and demanding

task.

NW 55110 DocId:32989560 Page 140



7 @ : @

It must be sufficiently flexible that it
does not stifle FBI effectiveness in combating the
growing incidence of crime and violence across the
United States. That charter must clearly address the
demonstrated problems of the past; yet, it must amply
recognize the fact that times change and so also do
the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive
challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has
commenced the formulation of operational guidelines
governing our intelligence activities does not in any
manner diminish the need for legislation. The responsibility
for conferring jurisdiction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals
which question the need for intelligence gathering, suggesting
that information needed for the prevention of violence can
be acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations.

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation
May well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But

there are some fundamental differences between these

ee

[ w 55110 Docld:32989560 Page 141



: eo @

investigations that should be recognized -- differences
in scope, in objective and in the time of initiation. In
the usual criminal case, a crime has occurred and it
remains only for the Government to identify the perpetrator
and to collect sufficient evidence for prosecution. | Since
the investigation normally follows the elements of the
erime, the scope of the inquiry is limited and fairly
well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves
the gathering of information, not necessarily evidence.
The purpose may well be not to prosecute, but rather
to thwart crime or to insure that the Government has
enough information to meet any future crisis or emergency.
The inquiry is necessarily broad because it must tell
us not only the nature of. the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent
paige anticipation of those unlawful acts. Anticipation,
in turn, is dependent on advance information -- that
is intelligence.

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on
these issues. Given the opportunity, I am confident
that the continuing need for intelligence work can be

documented to the full satisfaction of the Congress. \ We

NW 55110 DoclId:32989560 Page 142 - 13 -



“recognize that what is at stake here is not the interests

of the FBI, but rather the interests of every citizen
of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee
or its successor in this important task.

In any event, you have my unqualified assurance
as Director that we will carry out both the letter and

the spirit of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

SUBJECT: “Senate Select Committee letter dated December 16, 1975
aa

Attached is a letter from the Senate Select Committee
requesting delivery of certain materials concerning electronic
surveillance and surreptitious entries. Please arrange for an
appropriate response.

My initial view is that the Senate Select Committee should
be given the same excised versions of the authorizing documents
that the House Select Committee was given in response to its re-

quest. I would oppose giving the Senate Select Committee acc fe
to the unexcised version of these documents for security reaspngi,

With regard to the November 21 letter referenced in Jo
EL1iff's letter, we propose to give John Elliff access to the
inexcised versions of the documents but would prefer that the
enate Select Committee be given delivery of excised versions
nly. Elliff's letter appears to accept this arrangement.

With regard to the request for materials concerning any
surreptitious entries, the Senate Select Comittee is referring
to what was described as a surreptitious entry not related to a
, microphone surveillance in 1972 against an “Arab Terrorist Acti-
: ist". This surreptitious entry was listed on an FBI memorandum
jated November 5, 1975 which’was in response to a request from
the House Select committees” This memorandum was delivered initially

NW 55110 “DocTd:32989560 Page 174

Attached is a letter from the Senate Select Committee
requesting delivery of certain materials concerning electronic
surveillance and surreptitious entries. Please arrange for an
appropriate response.

My initial view is that the Senate‘Select Committee should
be given the same excised versions cf the authorizing documents
that the House Select Committee was given in response to its re~
quest. I would oppose givi the Senate Select Committee accose
to the unexcised version o nese documents for security reasor

With regard to the November 21 letter referenced in John“

LEE

ELLIff's letter, we propose to give John Elliff access to the

. unexcised versions of the documents but would prefer thac the

Senate Select Committee be given delivery of excised versions
only. Elliffts letter appears to accept this arrangement.

With regard to the request for materials concerning any
surreptitious entries, the Senate Select Committee is referring

to what was described as a surreptitious entry not related to a
microphone surveillance in 1972 against an “Arab Terrorist Acti-~
vist". This surreptitious entry was listed on an FBI memorandum
dated November 5, 1975 which was in response to a request from

the House Select Committ. ee This memorandum was delivered initially
to the Senate Select ca littee by mistake. Because I have not
