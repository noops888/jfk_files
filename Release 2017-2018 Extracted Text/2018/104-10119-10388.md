AOFEI report of August 1952 stated that Subject had duped
certain persons into buying a schooner, the "Elsie Riechart," by
eleiring that he and u crevy would operate it for Cuban operations
which would be paid for by the U. &. Government, although, the ~
Government could not openly acknowledge the support.

DETAILS:

When LABORDE visited the Nev Orleans DCS office on 11 May 1967,
he eafd he feared that GARRISON woul subpoens him and said he ws
willing to leave the U. S. to avoid a subpoena and that he wanted
the DCS office to tell him what to do. Subject's visit was believed
to be a provocation by GARRISON in an attempt to entrap CIA into
advising Bubject to leave Louisiana. ‘This would -have buttressed
GARRISON's charge that CIA and the FBI are attempting to obstruct
the course of justice in New Orleans.
