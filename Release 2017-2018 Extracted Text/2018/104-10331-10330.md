NOTE FOR THE RECORD
ar
SUBJECT: JFK~Package from Ford Library

1. On 9 June, at a meeting with NARA officials on the
JFK documents, I raised the subject of the package of
withdrawal sheets we had received from the President. Ford
Library. Steve Tilley, NARA advised me that no action was
required by CIA with regard to the package. He said he had
spoken with Karen Holzhausen of the Library about the
package, and learned that the sheets were sent to
Steve Katz, a Senate staffer, in response to a specific
request from him. Tilley agreed that HRG would hold the
package temporarily. .

2. I told him that we had identified classified

information in the package of withdrawal sheets e.g., name
of a station, although the sheets carried no classification.

He took note of this problem.

Subject : Rockefeller Commission files information

To : , Steve Katz, Senate Committee on Government Affairs

Enclosed are the finding aid to the Rockefeller Commission files
we have processed, copies of all the withdrawal sheets, and some
explanatory information.

About the withdrawal sheets: When we remove a classified .
document from a folder we record more information for
administrative purposes than you find on these withdrawal sheets.
The. data put into such fields as creator's agency, classifying
agency, classification level, comments, and special markings are
not printed on this short form that researchers see. Our
computer program was designed to produce these abbreviated public
descriptions because some agencies, chiefly the CIA, do not want
to be public identified as the originator of specific documents.
We have made the withdrawal sheets for the Rockefeller Commission
items we have processed more explicit than normal practice
because the Church Committee published the gist of most of these
documents in 1975, identifying the CIA connection. But, because
of the software limitations, the computer cannot print the
"agency" data on the short forn.

I think there is enough information for you to deduce the
originating. agency for most of these documents. Most of them
were supplied to the Rockefeller Commission by the CIA, although
many of them are of interagency origin. If you have questions
about®particular sheets, please don't hesitate to call me.

We may find that some, perhaps many, of these documents have
already been declassified, but rather than take the time to
research all of them and delay “opening the collection, we
simply “pink sheeted" everything and will wait to see what
happens with the proposed review commission. If they are not
systematically declassified, we will research them individually
as they are requested under mandatory review.
