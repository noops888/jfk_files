ADMINISTRATIVE: This report has been classifed CONFIDENTIAL

since data reported from T-l, I-2, T-3 and

I-5 could reasonably result in identification of confidentialâ„¢

informants of continuing value and compromise the effectiveness

thereof.

Inasmuch as the Denver Chapter, FPCC, is relatively inactive,

the Denver Division will continue to submit reports on a six-

month basis.

Agents who observed VINCENT TED LEE On 4/18/63 were SA'S JOSEPH

C. LEARNED and LOUIS D. NELAN.
