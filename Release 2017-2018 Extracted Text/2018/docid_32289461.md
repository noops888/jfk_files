On March 15, 1962, CHARLES SAMS, United States Mail

Carrier, advised SA STEPHEN

J. LABADIE

carried

mail to subject's residence at 250t, although he had

Bristol Avenue

for the past five years, he had never seen subject. He states,

as a matter of interest, he hardly ever sees anyone at 2505 Bristol

Avenue, and has only been in contact with an individual he knows

as ANNIE MAE JACKSON, the colored maid, because he also delivers

mail to her residence, 2505 Deleon. He noted that even though

ANNIE MAE had been pleasant enough

with him over several years;

she has never divulged any information concerning subject or his

residence. This source endeavored to locate subject

at his

residence on March 15, 1962, and reported subject was not

at his

residence.
