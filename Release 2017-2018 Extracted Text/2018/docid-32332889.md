DETAILS:
A. PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

1. Birth Data

T-1, a reliable source abroad, advised on April 30, 1958,
that SEBASTIAN LA ROCCA, the son of IGNAZIO and ROSARIA
SCANCARELLO, was born at Villa Rosa, Italy, on December 19,
1901. LA ROCCA departed Villa Rosa before 1927, the year
in which the registration of the inhabitants of the com-
munity of Villa Rosa was begun. :

2. Citizenship Status

On December 12, 1957, SA WILLIAM R. WALL ascertained from

the records of the Immigration. and Naturalization: Service
(INS), Pittsburgh, Pa., that JOHN LA ROCCA entered the United
States on September 2,-1910; at New York, New York, aboard
the "Principe De Piemonte."

These same INS records show that on May 12, 1950, LA ROCCA
applied for U. S. citizenship: On January 20, 1953, a
deportation warrant was issued for LA ROCCA by the District
Director, INS, Philadelphia, Pa., said warrant was based on
Sections 241 (a)(4) and 212 (a)(12) of the Immigration
Nationality Act. He was arrested January 21, 1953, and -
subsequently given a deportation hearing as an-undesirable
alien. This undesirable status was based on previous arrests
involving LA ROCCA on criminal-type charges. On August 31,
1953, LA ROCCA testified before an-INS Hearing Board that he
had been involved in the numbers racket, bootlegging, and
Slot machines, but added that he was no-longer. involved in
anything other than legitimate enterprises. The "Pittsburgh
Press," a Pittsburgh daily newspaper, publicized portions of
LA ROCCA's testimony.on November 10, 1954, and reported that
LA ROCCA had testified that his financial holdings amounted
to approximately one-quarter of a million dollars and if
permitted to remain in the United States, LA ROCCA testified
he would not become a burden of the state.

A-news release from the "Pittsburgh Press" dated January 27,
1955, stated in part: "The government today dropped attempt

A news release of the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette" dated May 15,
1957, reported in part that a Federal indictment against
ex-racketeer JOHN LA ROCCA was ordered reinstated by the
Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, Pa. In an
article dated October 11, 1957, this same newspaper reported
that LA ROCCA went on trial in Federal Court charged with
perjury and making false statements in connection with his
deportation hearing. Then on October 15, 1957, this same
newspaper reported in part that Federal Judge RABE F. MARSH
had ordered JOHN LA ROCCA acquitted on charges of perjury
and making false statements in connection with his deporta-
tion hearing. Judge MARSH ruled that the Government had
failed to show clear and convincing proof to back up its
charges.

HAROLD LAUVER, Investigator, Immigration and Naturalization.
Service, Pittsburgh, advised SA ROBERT A. VOEGE on March 13,
1958, that his office planned to take action concerning the
-Béetition of Naturalization filed by LA ROCCA on May 12, 1950,
and which had never been acted upon. Mr. LAUVER stated that
although LA ROCCA had made no new request and had not "pushed"
for action to be taken on the petition filed, his office was
setting up a hearing and was gathering information regarding
LA ROCCA's moral character, known recent criminal associates
and identities of persons willing to testify against LA ROCCA.

3. Education :

T-1 advised on April 20, 1958, that it was not possible to
ascertain whether or not LA ROCCA received any formal schooling
during the time that he was in Italy.

On February 13, 1958, FLOYD 0O.. SMITH, Supervising Principal,
and THOMAS J. ADDLEMAN, High School Principal, both of
Shannock Valley Joint School District, which includes Yates-
boro, Pa., where LA ROCCA formerly resided, advised that the
Old Yatesboro School had been abandoned-and that records

of attendance are not available for students who attended
from thirty to forty years ago. Both advised that although
they have been residents of Rural Valley-Yatesboro area for
forty or more years, they could not recall the LA ROCCA
family. .

With. regard to LA ROCCA's present residence, it is pointed
out that CASIMER J. PELLEGRINI, owner, Casimer J. Pellegrini
Associates, 201 South Craig Street, Pittsburgh, advised

SA ROBERT A VOEGE on April 24, 1958, that he designed and
directed the building of the home in which LA ROCCA now lives
and which he owns. He said that to duplicate this home today
would cost between $150,000 to $175,000.

It is pointed out that LA ROCCA's whereabouts have not been
known to individuals in his neighborhood or to other avail-
able sources since about December, 1957. It is also pointed
out that the U. S. Marshal's Office in Pittsburgh has had a
subpoena for LA ROCCA to appear before a New York investigating
. committee with ‘regard to LA ROCCA's possible presence at the
I. November 14, 1957, meeting at Apalachin, N. Y

STEIN, Manager of the J. G. PICKARD Store, Dunkirk, New York,
obtained a warrant for the arrest of JOHN LA ROCCA for
disposing of chattel mortgaged property. She stated that on
November 5, 1931, LA ROCCA appeared in court and paid STEIN
$115 for the property originally purchased and the charge
was dismissed. She advised that the J. G. PICKARD Company
went out of business’ approximately fifteen years ago and that

T-6 said that in the LA ROCCA residence seven murders were
committed within: the period of a few years and that no one
was ever prosecuted for any of these murders. Informant
said that in 1922 JOHN LA ROCCA attempted to kill TERESA
TRONZO and then after this attack the families of TRONZO
and LA ROCCA were constantly at odds‘and that they all
carried firearms. T-6 said that the LA ROCCA family had
threatened to kidnap TERESA TRONZO and place her in a
house of prostitution unless the charges against LA ROCCA
were dropped. (This offense has been previously reported
under the caption "Criminal Record.")

In October, 1942, Captain W. I, ENGLISH, U. S. Engineers
Office, Pittsburgh, advised SA DANTE DE LILLO that he had
information that JOHN LA ROCCA's liaison with the. Superin-
tendent of Police in Pittsburgh was through one GEORGE
MESSER. (MESSER admittedly has been a partner to LA ROCCA
in the numbers business in the East Liberty section of
Pittsburgh. )

On August 21,.1946, MESSER advised that he felt that an
attempt, on his life was brought about by JOHN LA ROCCA and
that LA ROCCA's attempt to squeeze him out of business was
the purpose for this attempt. MESSER said that LA ROCCA
had exclusive numbers rights in the Eighth Ward and also
rights in part of the Thirteenth Ward of Pittsburgh.

On. December 13, 1957, T-7, a representative of another
Government agency, advised that one MIKE GABLE and FRANK
VALENTI ‘arid AL LADISH, now deceased, illegally entered the
residence of an individual and stole from the premises a

-45 caliber automatic pistol.  T-7 stated that this allegedly
oceurred in 1942, 1943 or 1944. This source said that FRANK
VALENTI left this gun with JOHN LA ROCCA for safekeeping
and that: at a later date this same gun was used to kill one
GUS 'GIANNI. T-7 said that his source claimed that FRANK
VALENTI had told many times that no act could be committed
without the permission of JOHN LA ROCCA and that because of
this the source felt that LA ROCCA had knowledge.of, and
concurred with, the murder of GUS GIANNI.

T-7 further advised that CARLA FERRARI, who was a paramour
of FRANK VALENTI at the time of the FREDDIE GARROW a.

exist any longer because they have all been confiscated by
the Pennsylvania State Police during their various raids.

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE MESSER advised SA VOEGE that
he had been in the numbers writing activity since about
1928 and is still active in this regard. He said that most
of Pittsburgh's present day ‘big racket men" once depended
on him solely for protection purposes since he knew local
and state police figures and recalled that JOHN LA ROCCA
was one of these racketeers. MESSER stated that LA ROCCA
became acquainted with him in about 1941 or 1942 when

LA ROCCA was. handling all the numbers activity in the East
Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself up as a
"little God." When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied with his
financial gains, he left Pittsburgh on a trip to Chicago
to see friends about paste reel machines with which he felt
he could make more money. MESSER said a paste reel was
similar to a "one-armed bandit" with the exception that a
small paper-wrapped mint was dispensed after the coin was
placed in the slot and the play was registered. The
Chicago manufacturer of this machine circumvented the
"strictly for gambling purposes" phraseology in the law in
this manner.

While LA ROCCA was in Chicago, MESSER said he moved into the
East Liberty section and took over the entire numbers |
operation. He turned in his numbers returns to one GEORGE
CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When LA ROCCA returned
to Pittsburgh he became angry with MESSER and his move and
had someone drive a car over MESSER one night as he was
crossing a street. MESSER said when he was discharged from
the hospital he found out that his automobile had numerous
bullet holes in it. MESSER said that because he thought

he would make money in the East Liberty section he stayed
in the business of writing numbers and actually forced

LA ROCCA out of the numbers business.

MESSER advised that in about 1943 he and LA ROCCA became
friendly and LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in the
ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which
later set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh.
MESSER recalled that LA ROCCA was completely bankrupt at
that time because of numbers setbacks but managed to raise

- 24 -

HW 56792 DocId:32332889 Page 10



PG 92-226

enough money to put up his share. MESSER said he personally
travelled to Chicago to arrange for the purchase of machines
to be distributed by this company and had a verbal agree-

ment with ART ROONEY who allowed him to place these machines
throughout the East Liberty, Homewood and Garfield sections

of Pittsburgh where ROONEY was not operating. According

to MESSER, ROONEY, who is the present owner of the Pitts-
burgh Steelers professional football club, was the only man
who could get paste reels before LA ROCCA tried, and controlled
the entire Pittsburgh vicinity in this regard. MESSER said
that the government placed a $100 tax stamp on each machine
and the City of Pittsburgh put a $50 tax stamp on each machine.
He said that other owners of the company, in addition to
himself and.LA ROCCA, were FRANK AMATO, BARNEY McGINLEY,
SAMUEL MANNARINO and F, W. 'ZOGG, the latter from Chicago.

(a) .Dlldeit Alcohol

On August 31, 1953, LA ROCCA, while testifying at.an INS
hearing in his own behalf, stated that he had been ."mixed up"
in bootlegging, numbers racket, and slot machines, and that
in his earlier days he had worked as an Indiana County,. Pa.,
coal miner. LA ROCCA stated that he was then engaged only
in legitimate enterprises.

E, LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISES

On October 10, 1955,. JOHN LA ROCCA was interviewed at his
place of business on Craig Street by SA JOHN S. PORTELLA.
LA ROCCA stated that since his trouble with the Internal
Revenue. Service, and the INS, his business in the past three
years had dropped so much that he had his business and
property up for sale. LA ROCCA stated that he has been
patient and cooperative with all government agencies and
has been investigated and reinvestigated on numerous. occasions
and cannot understand why the government will not leave him
alone. LA ROCCA stated his true name is SEBASTIAN JOHN

LA ROCCA and -that he never liked the name SEBASTIAN and
consequently has been called JOHN for many years. LA ROCCA
stated that after he sells his business on Craig Street.

he will continue to operate the North Star Cement Block
Company. 7 :

the perjury. trial in Federal Court, Pittsburgh. The subject
had maintained that he had no connection with this business
as of February 19, 1948, when this business was raided by
the Allegheny County Detective Bureau and thirty-eight slot
machines were confiscated.

FRED M. THIER, 422 Miller Avenue, Duquesne, made a sworn
statement on March 15, 1954, that the Duquesne Vending
Company was never sold and that LA ROCCA was still a
partner at the time of the raid.

A search of the records of the Prothonotary's Office failed
to reveal any record of the Bulk Beverage Company which
LA ROCCA had alleged that he owns. :

HAROLD W. LAUVER, INS,Investigator, advised on December 16,
1957, that he had made a search of the prothonotary's records
at Fayette County, Pa., and had not been able to locate any
record concerning the Fayette Novelty Company nor the Rock-
O-La Corporation which have been allegedly owned in the

past by the subject.

A news item dated November 10, 1954, appearing in the "Pitts-
burgh Press" reflects that JOHN LA ROCCA testified before

the Immigration Hearing Board that his net’ worth is $258,500
and that he has had no income from gambling or other illegal
sources. in the past ten years. ‘

With regard to the North Star Cement Block Company, it is
pointed out that on December 10, 1957, T-8, a representative
of another ency, advised that

Regarding the Standard Dryer Distributing Company, it is
pointed out that prothonotary records, under fictitious
names registration, Volume 133, page 42, Certificate No.
42387, list the United Hand Dryér Distributing Company,
500 North Craig Street, Pittsburgh. The character of this
business was to buy, sell and distribute mechanical hand
dryers, and the interested partners were JOHN S, LA ROCCA,
The date the certificate was issued May 12, 1954.

LA ROCCA advised at the time of his deportation hearing

that after the termination of the Standard Dryer Distributing
Company, prothonorary records, fictitious name registration,
Volume-120, page 19, Certificate No. 38182, he formed the
United Hand Dryer Distributing Company. Heretofore these

It is noted that the registration card No. B-56740 of the
Arlington Hotel, Binghamton, N. Y., dated November 14, 1957,
listed JOHN S. LA ROCCA, Coin Machine Distributing Company,
500 North Craig Street, Pittsburgh.

On March 4, 1958, T-9, whose records are available through
the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum, advised that his
records show that on November 9, 1956, his records show
that $45,000 was loaned to JOHN LA ROCCA and his wife,
MARY S. LA ROCCA. It'was noted that $1,000 was paid on
this loan on January 7, 1957, and that $500 payments were
made each month thereafter until January 30, 1958, with
the exception of September, when two $500 payments were
made during that month.

It was noted that there was still a $37,500 balance re-
maining on this loan as of March 4, 1958, and that this
was apparently the second loan made to LA ROCTA.

No notation was noted which would indicate the purpose
of this $45,000 loan. °

On January 27, 1958, Mrs. CLOVER GIBSON, Secretary, and Miss
LORENA SANDERS, Clerk, Velda Rose Motel, Hot Springs, made —
records available to SA ROBERT E. HICKMAN, which revealed that
JOHN S. LA ROCCA, 500 North Craig Street, Pittsburgh, registered
in the Velda Rose Motel on October 22, 1957, with one JOHN
SCARDINO (address not given) and departed on November 8, 1957.
The records revealed that the subject and SCARDINO resided

in Rooms 118 and 99. According to Miss SANDERS, the subject
seemingly was in Hot Springs to take the baths and to her
recollection had no visitors in his room. Miss SANDERS
advised that she did not know what places the subject
frequented while visiting in Hot Springs nor did she know

any individuals he contacted while in Hot Springs. Miss
SANDERS pointed out that the motel did not maintain telephone
numbers of local calls their guests make. i

On January 21, 1958, Mr. AUSTIN PITTMAN, Assistant Manager)
Arlington Hotel, Hot Springs, advised that a review of his
records from 1954 to. present revealed no information regarding
