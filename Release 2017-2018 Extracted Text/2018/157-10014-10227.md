He also asked that a telegram be sent

other hand, we are in no way responsible for stopping every such threat of which we might

OCCURRENCE:

The I.G. REPORT of 1967 (CIA) contains the following, description of the events of August 25,

1963, from a book by MARGUERIIE HIGGINS:

"The crucial act, with its overtones of Greek

tragedy, opened with a cable. It was dispatched to Saigon late in the evenine; of August 24,

1903, a date made more significant because it was a Saturday. Washington usually empties or

summer weekends or lapses into a somnolent mood as officials desperately seek relaxation.

"The telegram contained spectacular new instructions for the U.s. EMBASSY in SAIGON.

It was drawn up at a meeting, called by Under-secretary of State AVERELL HARRIMAN and ROGER

HILSMAN, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs and head of the Vietnam task

force.

The President's senior advisers were, for the most part, out of town. CIA DIRECIOR

JOHN MCCONE was in California. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT MCNAMARA was on vacation. (con't)

Diem on May 6, 1963 revived

a regulation banning the public display of any

religious flag--either the Buddhist or Catholic-- having any precedence over the National

Vietnamese flag in public places or in public view.

Higgins does not doubt that the

Vietnamese government's decision to revive these flag regulations on May 6, 1963 made

possible the Hue tragedy. Ironically, action by Diem has been generally viewed as anti-

Buddhist. His May 6 circular had been provoked a few days earlier in Da Nang by the

excessive use by Catholics of the flag of the vatican with the National Vietnamese flag

on view being sometimes tattered and torn and few in number. (9L)

And that DIEM led a Catholic regime and that this drove people, particularly in

OCCURRENCE: Mecklin stated that the American position following the incident at Hue

for the May 8 killings, and to indemnify the victims and apologize, perhaps

was to "urge Dien to repair all Buddhist grievances forthwith, to accept responsibitily

Hue himself to do so." (Ambassador Nolting was on a Mediterranean vaction at the time.)

"According to Mecklin, William Trueheart, the Charge d'Affaires, applied on orders from

Washington,

'direct, relentless, tablehammering pressure on Diem

such as the United States

had seldom before attempted with a sovereign friendly government...' In despair Trueheart

in June resorted to a formal warning to Diem that if he continued repressive measures

(police effort to prevent and disperse illegal demonstrations), the United States would

be forced to disassociate itself publicly from such actions, as indeed we did two months

later. The warning was a momentous step. It amounted to rectafticial command from

chance to get out of it and get out of it very gracefully within the first two weeks after

the 8th of May incident in HUE by meeting the demands of paying off the families of those

people who were killed when the military attacked the pagodas in Hue.

Nguyen Van Bang later at the trial of Major Däng

sounds of broken glass, gunshots, and exploding hand grenades.". In the confusion Major

Dang Sy heard the explosions also and in attempting to signal

what he feared may be a

Viet Cong attack fired three shots in the air. Unfortunately this was the prearranged

signal authorizing his troops to use grenades to disperse the crowds. At least 15 of

these grenades were throw and the explosions caused at least 8 dead at the radio station.

(95) This statement though, appears to be in conflict with later medical evidence coming

from the Interior Minister which found that none of the bodies of the dead had metal

splinters in their organs, but rather the weapons expert said that the bombs were probably

made of plastic and that "plastic is the arm of the Viet Cong guerilla." (95-96)

not listen. Nguyen Van Bang then asked for armored cars in hopes that this would

Police arrived and attempted to turn fire hoses on the crowd. (93-94)

OCCURRENCE:

....Diem was not conforming to Western standards of democracy. And this

was really the heart of the case against him. Implicit in their criticism was the assump-

tion that Occidental style democracy was, in fact, the answer to Oriental Vietnam's problems.

It was an assumption with which Ngo Dinh Diem disagreed on both practical and philosophical

grounds."

OCCURRENCE:

Higgins notes that Kennedy dispatched Krulik and Mendenhall to Viet Nam to make a tour of

Returning to Washington, Krulik and Mendenhall each gave a different report on the

effect. Higgins notes that Kennedy asked wryly, "Have you two fellows been in the same

country?" Higgins goes on to note that this was indeed Indicative of the American reac-

tion to Vietnam generally. Krulik, Higgins points out, visited the theatre of war by go-.

ing to all core areas as well as six divisional and some twenty-five regimental and bat-

talion headquarters.

"As part of the pressure on the government in the Augus:

We did not suspend our assistance to the police or to the

military who were involved in that, but CIA is an easy thing to turn off, turn on and off.

The other programs are much more difficult to turn on and off. In a simple way, I think t:

units outside of Saigon when we said we would continue to support them."

OCCURRENCE: COLBY stated that the United States sought to put pressure on President DIEM

and the government, particularly to remove NG DINH HU from the country, to bring about cer-

tain changes of policy in August of 1963 that was thought necessary to improve the perfor-

mance of the government of South Vietnam. Among these were the suspension of Public Law

480 aid the suspension of the commodity import program. And also through various contacts

with dissident generals, the United States was requested whether it would stand aside if

the generals ran their own coup, and they were given the response in general terms that,

"Yes, we would stand aside, and yes, we would continue the aid program if a successor gov-

emment took over and looked reasonably able to carry on the war.

This can only be read as

a green light to the generals. This message was passed through a CIA officer, but his cre-

ditentials were checked by the generals receiving this kind of a message, with the Ambassador

and with the Chief of the Military Ald group in Saigon so_

that there was no question

stressed the need to unify U.S. government posture, to coordinate press guidance and to

control outgoing messages to Saigon. He emphasized the Importance of following the

President's guidance on this delicate problem, in spite of intensly differing views of

what should be done and how, the risk, minimun objectives, and facts. McNamarra stated

that his position was virovously against throwing out this government without seeing

an alternative and that none appeared to exist.

Mr. McCone cormented that the problem

was not so much the existance of an alternative as to how to put one into power.

Bundy

OCCURRENCE:

On 5 October there was a Presidential meeting on Vietnam. The only CIA participant was

MeCone. He provided the following record.

The meeting was held to discuss matters that

becane the subject of DEPTEL 5/34 (See later entry of 5 October.) DCI said it was the

opinion of CIA with the exception of Colby, Chief Fareast Division, that fiddling with

the cormodity import program as a political lever would be much more likely to create

an econonic crisis undermining the war effort than to scare Diem and Nhu into a more

coperative attitude, because it would seriously affect the confidence and planning

of the Vietnamese business cormunity and quickly engender inflationary measures at

large of a more serious nature.

It was the concensus of the meeting that some meaningful

political movements had to be made but exactly what they should be was not determined.

OCCURRENCE: COLBY testified as to the events surrounding the cable, from Saigon of 5 Octo-

ber 1963 which reads as follows: "We do not set ourselves irrevocably against the assass-

ination plot since the other two alternatives mean either a blood bath in Saigon, or a pro-

tracted struggle which could rip the army and the country asunder." And the response on

6 October 1963 which COLBY wrote for MC CONE as follows:

"MC CONE directs that you withdraw

recommendation to Ambassador concerning assassination plan under MC CONE Instructions as we

cannot be in a position to actively condone such course of action thereby endangering our

our responsibility, therefore COLBY explained that this second message he drafted was to

eliminate assassination as an alternative. COLBY stated that the assassination of DIEM's

other brothers NHU and KAHN, NGO DINH KAHN, were to continue. A reply was sent on October 7

from Saigon in response to the MC CONE cable saying that action was taken as directed, mean-

ing that the Ambassador had been so informed to withdraw the recommendation."

OCCURRENCE:

On October 8, 1963 at a special group meeting the DCI expressed concern that there

was a lack of Intelligence coverage during the period when "the U.S.

was maintaining

a posture of almost no official contact at top levels." They refer to the fact

that NHU and DIEM are not being contacted by Americans. Mr. MCCONE also referred

to "theorientation of (Saigon) station functions." Mr. BUNDY pointed out that "for

Americans to resume top level contacts at this time would appear to represent

a political rapprochement. Ambassador LODGE might feel that this was running

counter to his policy."

The Group gave its approval to the basis realignment of

station functions. (The nature of such functions are not outlined.)

OCCURRENCE:

On 8 September 1963, the CIA IG report reflects in a conment that the U.S.

government publicly confirmed on Oct. 8, 1963 that aid had alraady been cut

quitely and over a period of some months. Bill Colby,

Jock Anderson and Dave Snith

told us that the public announcement of the aid reduction was a signal to the

and that the reduction was planned with that in mind. It may be that

the cut in aid was deliberately planned to spur the generals on, but if so, that

intention did not find its way into the record. The nearest thing to it is

record of a presidential meeting of 10 September 1963. The President asked

Rufus Phillips of AID what specific actions Phillips recemnended and he suggested

"cutting aid to Colonel lung which would be viewed by the generals with much

enthusiasm as an indication of virgouous of American position.

"In general,

ald cuts were discussed in terns of bring pressure on Diem to make needed changes in

token of their support of coup planning.

OCCURRENCE: On November 1, 1963, "CONEIN went to IGS headquarters and remained at the

command post throughout the struggle. Before leaving his home, CONEIN alerted the STATION

by radio. Upon arriving at JGS headquarters, CONEIN was told by GENERAL DON that DON had

tried unsuccessfully to reach CONEIN earlier by telephone. A later check revealed that

CONEIN's telephone was out of order. CONEIN was told that he was to keep a telephone line

open to the Ambassador. Because there was a CIA officer on the scene and in intimate con-

tact with the coup principals, the STATION was able to report almost minute-by-minute progres:

of the coup."

OCCURRENCE:

TOP SECRET

COLBY states that "When CONEIN was told by the generals, GENERAL MINH,

that the NHU brothers, DIEM and NHU, had committed suicide, CONEIN thought it incredible

on its face. This was because both brothers were very strong Catholics and CONEIN doubted.

that they would have done such a thing. According to COLBY, CONEIN was offered a chance

to look at the bodies but turned it down. In trying to reconstruct the period of the assass-

ination on November 1, COLBY reports that there was a telephone conversation between Presi-

dent DIEM and the generals. In fact there were several of them. President DIEM was very

strongly rejecting the generals, calling them to discipline, and so forth, in the early

15, at ine treme cects line,

stages. At a later stage, in the early morning of November 1, he called and indicated that

he would surrender if he would be properly handled. The generals then sent somebody down to

receive that surrender and found that President DIEM was not there. He'd actually gotten

out through the back door of the palace and had gone down to another section of the city.

cabled a warning to the STATION against Including the names of CIA personnel in its CRITIC

OCCURRENCE: COLBY stated that "Ihe CIA had nothing to do with the assassination of Pres-

ident DIEM and Mr. NHU. The actual assassination was a shock and surprise to everyone in

ihe United States

in retrospect, one must realize that there was, however, considerable debate about encoura.

ing and supporting the generals in an overthrow of the DIEM regime, and that the record is

very clear that the United States through itsoverall policy was in support of that overthri

and, of course, I think it is fair to say that in launching a violent overthrow of a

gime involved such as this, people are going to get hurt, and in this case, the leaders we:

killed in the process."

probably figured their chances pretty closely.......It does not seem sensible to have

BUNDY (?)

OCCURRENCE: On October 30, 1963, in a CIA cable to Saigon (DIR 7940%) the following

quotation appeared: "....We do not accept as a basis for U.S. policy that we have no power

to delay or discourage coup....We cannot limit ourselves to proposition implied in your

message that only conviction of certain failure Justifies intervention....U.S. authorities

will reject appeals for direct intervention from either side....

" ( the IG Report here

states without further showing the author of the above message that "the White House re-

peats its instructions on command of the country team after LODGE leaves. "

The inference

can probably be drawn that the message although looked upon as a CIA cable to Saigon, 1t

was indoubtedly emanating from the White House.)

OCCURRENCE: On 2 November 1963, GENERAL DON informed CONEIN that he needed money to pay

the families of persons killed during the coup. CONEIN gave GENERAL DON an additional

1,750,000 piasters. One bundle of 250,000 piasters was overlooked and was found later in

CONEIN's safe. (The IG Report goes on to note as follows:

"The passing of these funds is

obviously a very sensitive matter.")

OCCURRENCE:

At the trial of Dang Sy by the Khanh regime that

ucceeded that of the

dup adore temporary or provisional goverment, khan ee not as ted that the

deaths had been caused-by American-supplied grenades af

use had been ordered by Dang Sy, and the conviction by the military court was that the 8

deaths were caused by these concussion grenades. Higgins argues in her book that this

conviction is contrary to the Pentagon's assessment of the MKIII grenade which found that

at worst the effects of such a grenade are non-fatal. Nor does such a grenade have suffi-

cient force to decapitate or mutilate persons, let alone bring down the ceilings, doors,

and windows that were adjacent to the veranda of the radio station.

(95-96) Higgins also

states that: "The conviction of Major Dang Sy certainly throws no light on the matter

one way or another. The trial was clearly rigged from the start." (96-97)

OCCURRENCE: In concluding, the IG Report makes the following observations: "To recap:

(a) CIA was not in favor of the decision to abandon the DIEM regime, but faithfully carried

out instructions. (2) CIA officers CONEIN and SPERA were the contacts with the coup gener-

als, but only as approved and under instructions.

(c) A ClA officer, CONEIN, was at the

generals' command post throughout the fighting.

(d) CONEIN furnished GENERAL DON about

$65,000 to buy off opposition military units while the coup was in progress. (e) CIA had

no hand in the assassinations and had no foreknowledge of them."
