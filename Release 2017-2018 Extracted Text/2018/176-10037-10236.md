1Lm28s in Cuba

Fuselage crates for nine

IL-28 (Beagle) jet bombers were

identified on 4 November at

Holguin airfield in Oriente

Province.

These are almost certainly

the IL-28 crates

Ã¶bserved on the

Soviet vessel Leninsky Komsomol

gether with Il-28s previously

seen at San Julian,

they raise

to 42 the number of IL28s and

IL-28 fuselage crates observed

in Cuba.

There is no evidence that

preparations are under way to

withdraw the IL-28s despite

Khrushchev's statement to

President Kennedy on 28 October

that the USSR will send back

to the Soviet Union "those

weapons you call offensive."

Early this year work was

begun on lengthening the tun-

ways at Holguin airfield and

building covered aircraft re-

vetments there.

Work was ap-

parently completed in July, but

the airfield had been used very

little if at all untiltnow. The

16 covered revetments at Holguin

airfield are apparently similar

to those used by MIG fighters.

at three other Cuban military

airfields.

in-

dicates that more than 100 Soviet

helicopters have been shipped to

Cuba so far..

About

75 percent

of these have arrived since the

start of the intensive military

build-up last July. Many of

them are still in crates at an

assembly area located at Playa

Baracoa airfield west of Ha-

vana.

They will enhance con-

siderably Castro's capabilities

to cope with antigovernment in

surgents.
