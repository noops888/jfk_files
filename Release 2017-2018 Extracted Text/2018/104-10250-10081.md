Subject: Contact with Mr. Kimsey after his Separation from CIA.

As my: former supervisor for 6 years in the Agency, Mr. K. apparently

wanted to keep up a superficial social contact with me. Every 3 or 4 months, he

cxlled me at home or in the office; as a rule, first to inform me of some article or

TV program which could be of interest to m

me of his various professional prospects.

Since that time, there cannot heve been rore than 2 or 3 telephone calls.

In September 1963, I received various late night telephone calls from Cleve
Baxter in New York City, explaining details of the case involving Eugenia Smith

who claims to be “Anastasial, C.B. asked me to look over the handwriting material

following weekend for Puerto Rico, C.3. sent the handwriting mater-

for an early reply. - I sent a

jal (fron 1912 to 1963) to the hotel there, 4
report regarding psychologica?. aspects in the development of the handwriting, more
or less es a tasis for the work which would have to be done by 4 questioned document
examiner. After that, I did not hear much anymore, except that the publisher

Speller and Co. (for whom C.B. vas, Working) Sent ine a copy of the book "Anastasia",

elated to it which could give some psychological clues.

I never made a handwriting analysis of the case, and the bill for the work I had
dons was never paid, To my knowledge, in this phase of my work, there was not

any connection with Mr. K., and he was not even mentioned in my conversations with
Cleve Baxter. -

Two weeks ago, Mr. Baxter sent me (without comment) the reprint of a New
Hampshire newspaper, in which the appearance of the former "Czar", a former CIA
agent, & Polish ¥EMMKAX Col. G., was mentioned. I marked this passage and brought
it to the office, where John Gittinger forwarded it immediately to Faul Gaynor,

ned.a few day:

Sudject: “The Former CIA Agent, the Polish Col. G.

In my contacts with Mr. K. and with Cleve Baxter, this man was never mentioned
and I did not know of his existence, until I read the article in the New Hampshire
newspaper, It goes without saying ‘that I never nade a graphological analysis of his
hendwriting, as-per their request. -

It is possible that I did work for the Agency on this man's‘ handwriting under |
