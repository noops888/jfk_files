2. The following were Garrison's charges:

a. Kemnedy waco murdered because he favored a
detente detrimental to the tnterestea of the "military-
industrial complex".

(by Kennedy wan the victim of a CLA plot. CLA
* has made common cause with the military-industrial
establishment because of a vested iaterest im maintaining
the cold war.

e. CLA is committed to the land was in Asia,
whereas one of President Kennedy's last orders directed
& reduction of treops there.

Lore ad. A U.S. president who brings the U-S. te the
Lake of peace wilh suffer Kennedy's fate.

@.) Asked why the program had been dasigned for
a Eusopeaa audience, Garrison sald that the growing
influence of CYA on U.S. media had made ig impossible for
him to be heard in hio own country.

So. Reference A. cape: Garxisos,.cabm and. oe ee
juiticientdy exedible to elicit rather favorable reviews from generally
well informed Dutch newspapers. "Several Dutch viewezs alzo
commented om the credibility fet? his person and presentation.
Likely that the NFS will try te ) sail this program te other Buropean
stations." *

4, Reference B says that the Dutch press was generally favorable
and that many comments moted he seemed logical and in control of his
facts. The majority opinion amoug Embassy, USIS, and CIA persome)
at The Hague fo that be seemed credible to a large proportion of the
Dutch viewers. SYMPATHIZER 17 feels that the program created an
all-time lew im the U.S. image ia the Netherlands. Duteh TV alluded
to a third past of the interview, still to come.

5. Garrison was interviewed by William L. Oltmans. A

g- The Haague Post of 15 April 1981, with a
nationwide readership, characterized Oltmans as an :
intimate friend of the then President of Indonesia, Sukarno,

"So you are Frieda. Well, fam Sukis." He toid her
