that WILLIAMS was a fugitive from justice, at which time the
subject stated that he felt that the KENNEDY administration
could have the Federal charges against WILLIAMS dropped and
WILLIAMS could return to the US, though not to North Carolina.
He stated that if WILLIAMS were "handled right", he would denounce
CASTRO-and-the—Cuban-Governmerit. “THIS Would bé, in the subject's
“opinion, advantagecis to the US from a propaganda viewpoint. The
subject stated that at the present time WILLIAMS is attempting to
leave Cuba to go to Africa, probably..duinea. The subject stated
that he was not motivated to initiate this contact by any specific
loyalty to the US Government, but he had gcne to the FPCC because
CBS had broken its promise to him and for money. He stated that
he had received no money while at FPCC, and at the present time
he is broke and living off his wife's unemployment check., He stated
that he felt that Cuban leaders had operatéd stupidly and he
etested stupidity. They had made mistakes, as US officials had.

e subject stated that he was now in a position where he would ra)
assist the FBMgand/or CIA@in return for fin ial remunerations,|
but not because of any allegiance to. the ugas
he would be receptive to make a public statement that the FPCC
was a useless and ineffective organization if the terms (money)
were right.

(the subject stated that he still hoped that CIA would

contact him in Montreal, Canada, as he felt he could assist CIA
in Latin America,|as in his position as head of the FPCC,he could 6)
more easily"get In places with leftist groups " than others.
ie stated that he could also help CIA arrange to meet his "contacts!

Latin erica, although he refused to identify any of these alleged
contacts, The subject stated that there have been no specific :
threats to his life, but there have been implied threats by the
"eounter-revolutionaries OR) X04

- The subject stated that TABER had no influence in the
FPCC, and-described TABER as"no more a Communist than I am." He
stated that TABER was mixed up and had a problem more domestic
than anything else. 4 :

The subject stated that LYLE STUART had given money
to him as a friend. He described STUART as a maverick and one
who liked to be different. The subject stated further that the
Cuban Government officials had treated STUART badly since they
refused to grant STUART a. visa to visit Cuba. The subject
stated that STUART was an honest man who would have reported things
as he saw them, The subject said that this honesty was one of
the reasons for STUART being refused the visa. uy

The subject stated that TED LEE was a harmless fanatic
who had been trying to take over the FPCC, 7

The subject was asked what he considered a reasonable
amount of money for his services, and he stated that he did not

know (Xu) aw . a

GIBSON indicated that he would be willing to publicly
denounce the FPCC, that he ‘was duped, that FPCC is a tool of the
Cuban Government, that it is ineffective, and anyone still remaining
loyal is just wasting his time, or any other tact subseguently
determined to be the most effective course of conduct. Yaiowever, '
there was an undertone that he would be paid for any efforts in
this regard. He stated that it was his personal opinion that
it would. be much more effective to use the FPCC as a cover for

itelligence and counter-intelligence purposes, but when questioned
for his specific thinking in this regard, he,commented only that
this could probably be worked out laters} 4G)

It is pointed out to the Bureau that it is the estimation
of the interviewing agents that GIBSON is a very weasel-like
character, evasive,opportunistic, with very little or no moral
fiber at all. However, he has been reasonably well accepted by
practically all segments of the radical left movement in NY, and
to a limited extent in other cities, He is well acquainted with
a@ group of what he considers to be young Negro intellectuals, :
but it is conceivable, if handled properly under. some circumstances,
he could conceivably prove of some value to this Bureau. a

GIBSON, in the opinion of the interviewing agents, |
very obviously lied concerning his knowledge of subsidization |-
of the FPCC on the part 18 Bos ban Government. During the inter- \
view the specific quest SOF r

received any money from the Cuban Governments ® GIBSON replied,
"Oh, it's been a long time...I mean nevey since I've had anything
to do with the organization..." Obviously GIBSON answered before
he realized the full import of the question, and then attempted to
backtrack, In addition to the above, there were many other areas
where GIBSON either lied outright, or was extremely evasive in

his answers. 3
: (

The interview was concluded on a reasonably cordial
basis, and the door left open for a recontact. It is the opinion
of the NYO that GIBSON should be recontacted and interviewed
within the next week or so, at which time a specific program could
be worked out with GIBSON for disruption and ultimate dissolvement
of the FPCC.. It is pointed out that the NYO is fully cognizant
that currently GIBSON is serving as little more than a figurehead
in the organization, and if he would merely drop. from the organiza-
tion, it is quite likely that the SWP or other radical elements
would immediately fill -the.vacupral created by his resignation.

Following the next contact with GIBSON, the NYO will
submit the detailed results of that interview, including its
recommendation for both a tactical and strategic plan to be
implemented to disrupt, dissolve, or at least neutralize the
FPCC as a subversive organization. | x (W i

No specific commitment or other deal for payment for

GIBSON's services will be made during the next contact, but the
NYO's recommendation in this regard will be furnished with the i
results of the second intervie + is noted-that GIBSON requested,
nat he be placed in contact with CIA,Jbut the NYO is recommending S)

% this request be held in abeyance” until such time as a final
determination be made as to whether GIBSON with his background
could be "exploited by this Bureau. For the further
information of the Sureau, the recontact of GIBSON will take place i
under reasonably identical circumstances, in a NYC hotel room under |
secure conditions. The NYO is closely following this matter, and i
the Bureau will be kept advised of all developments. Ai
