The subject stated that LYLE STUART had given money

to him as

a friend.

He described STUART as a maverick and

one

who liked to be different.

The subject stated further that the

Cuban Government officials had treated STUART badly since they

refused to grant STUART a visa to visit Cuba.

The subject

stated that STUARI was an honest man who would have reportedthings

as he saw them.

The subject said that this honesty was one of

the reasons for STUARI being refused the visa. 4

The subject stated

that TED LEE was a harmless fanatic

who had been trying to take over the FPCC.

The subject was asked what he considered a reasonable

amount of money for his services, and he stated that he did not

know (4(4)

GIBSON indicated that he would be willing to publicly

denounce the FPCC, that he was duped, that FPCC is a tool of the

Cuban Government, that it is ineffective, and anyone still remaining

loyal 1s just

wasting his time, or any other tact subsequently

etermined to be the most ellective course of conduct. However

here was an undertone that he would be paid for any efrorts ir

this regard.

He stated that it was his personal opinion that

it would be much more effective to use the FPCC as a cover for

Intelligence and counter intelligence purposes, but when questioned

for his specific thinking in this regard

.commented only that

this could probably be worked out later.

y(5)

It is pointed out to the Bureau that it is the estimation

of the interviewing agents that GIBSON is a very weasel-like

character, evasive, opportunistic, with very little or no moral

fiber at all.

he has been reasonably well accepted by

practically all segments of the radical left movement In NY, and

to a limited extent in other cities.

He is well acquainted with

a group

of what he considers to be young Negro intellectuals,

but it is conceivable, if handled properly under some circumstances,

he could conceivably prove of some value to this Bureau.

GIBSON, in the opinion of the interviewing agents,

very obviously lied concerning his knowledge of subsidization

of the FPCC on the part.

to do with the organization...

Obviously GIBSON answered before

he realized the full import

of the question, and then attempted to

backtrack.

In addition to the above, there were many other areas

where GIBSON either lied outright, or was extremely evasive in

his answers.

The interview was concluded on a reasonably cordial

basis, and

It is the opinion

of the NYO that GIBSON should be recontacted and interviewed

within the next week or so, at which time a specific program could

be worked out with GIBSON for disruption and ultimate dissolvement

of the FPCC.

It is pointed out that the NYO is fully cognizant

that currently GIBSON is serving as little more than a figurehead

In the organization, and if he would merely drop. from the organiza-

tion, it is quite likely that the SWP or other radical elements

would immediavely fill the vacuu created by his resignation.

Following the next contact with GIBSON, the NYO will

submit the detalled results of that interview, including its

recommendation for both a tactical and strategic plan to be

Implemented to disrupt, dissolve, or at least neutralize the

EPCC as a subversive organization. e(V

No specific commitment or other deal for payment for

GIBSON's services will be made during the next cortact, but the

NYO's recommendation in this regard will be furnished with the

that he be placed in contact with CIA, but the NYO is recommending

nat this recuest be held in abeyance until such time as a tina

determination be made as to whether GIBSON with his background

could be

exploited

by this Bureau.

For the further

information of the

Bureau, the recontact of GIBSON will take place

under reasonably identical circumstances, in a NYC hotel room under

secure conditions.

The NYO is closely following this matter, and

the Bureau will be kept advised of all developments.
