Me. Halpern. Samuel Halpern, H-a-1-p-e-r-n, 2202 Popkins,
P-o-p-k-i-n-s, Lane, Alexandria, Virginia, 22307.

Mr. Johnston, Mr, Halpern, you previously testified before
the Committee, and I assume you know that you have various righth,
the right to counsel, and that you previously have been furnishell
a copy of the Committee rules, is that correct?

Mr, Halpern. That is correct.

Johnston. And you're testifying here today voluntarily).

Halpern: That is correct.

Johnston. What was your position with the CIA in the
period, say, June to becomber, 19637

Mr. Halpern. I was the executive officer for the Special
Affairs Staff of the Directorate of Plans. The staff was
responsible for operations against Cuba at that time.

Mr. Johnston. And you were executive assistant to Mr.
Fitzgerald, who was chief.

Mr. Halpern. That is correct.

Senator Schweiker. Were they two different capacities, o¢
the same?

Mr. Halpern, It's the same. The actual title was Executiv/
officer at that time.

Senator Schweiker. Okay.

W, and was under Mr. Harvey.

Mz. Johnston. And did you have a similar capacity under
him?

Mr. Halpern. Yes, I was Executive Officer under TFW.

Mr. Johnston. And when did you leave the Special Affairs
Staff?

Mr. Halpern. To the best of my recollection, sometime
around late summer or around Labor Day of 1964.

Senator Schweiker. When did you come aboard it?

Mr. Halpern. The staff?

Senator Schweiker. In other words, Task Force W. In
other words, whatever it was called at the time, Task Force W
I guess.

Mr. Halpern. I was in the branch of the Western Hemisphere|
pivision when it was taken out of the Western Hemisphere Divisio
and turned into Task Force W, and that was in early ‘62.

Mr. Johnston. What were your responsibilities as executive
officer to Hr. Fitzgerald?

lr. Halpern. Almost anything he wanted me to do, Basicall}:
it was to be sure that all of the papers that did reach his
desk were in correct form, content and distribution and routing.

Nothing in the line of command. From time to time I did get

Desmond Fitzgerald's SAS have at its peak at Headquarters?

Mr. Halpern. To the best of my recollection, about 150
at Headquarters.

Senator Schweiker. When it was Task Force W, how large wou
it be?

Mr. Halpern. 200, 225, something like that. That's very
much a guess at this point. That includes officers and cleri-:.

That's right.

Johnston. Did he also report to Mr. Cane, J. C. Cane?

Halpern.

Oh, no, no, no, there was nothing like that.

It was taken completely out of the divisional, regional lines

of command and made a special staff.

Senator Schweiker. There was nothing that related to

Cuba, Cuban activity or anti-Castro activity, after that was

done, that went through: the formally normal channel.

Mr.

Halpern.

only in regard to seeking the help of the

Western Hemisphere Division and its stations, to help us in

our activities.

Obviously Cuba was still part of the Western

Hemisphere geographically, and you need to have help, for

example, if we are going to send people from TFW or SAS into

Mexico or into Venezuela, you had to get permission of the

holding division.

So in that regard we had an awful lot of

work to do with and constant liaison and communication with the

Western Hemisphere Division, the same kind of activity we had

with other divisions such as Europe, where we had quite a bit

of.activity in Spain because of the Cuban refugees in Spain.

But most of it was at that time obviously with the Western

Mr. Johnston. ~ Did SAS in the fall of 1963 have any of its

own people in Mexico City?

Mr. Halpern, Yes. How many, I don't know, but we did have
gome that were attached to the station there, under the station
command.

The staff had no authority to break the chains of command,
and everything that was communicated to and from the SAS
assignees anywhere else in the world went through WH Division
here in Washington, and they saw the replies when it came from
the station.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall whether Mr. David Phillips was

one of the SAS people in Mexico City?

Mr. Halpern. No, I do not.

Mr. Johnston. You do not recall?

Mr. Halpern. I do not recall.

Mr. Johnston, Who provided counterintelligence support
to the Special Affairs Staff?

Mr. Halpern, We had our own small counterintelligence
staff. I believe, if memory serves me, it was headed up somezi:
during this period by Hal Swenson, who is a CI specialist, anc
we always had, of course, the support of the CI Staff of the di.

Mr. Halpern. I don't know, sir.

We had people assigned to the station in Mexico, but I |

Senator Schweiker. SAS had people.

Mr. Halpern. Yes. We had people there, we had some in
Madrid, I believe, and we may have had them in other places.

Senator Schweiker. The Chief of Station would have reporte|:

Mr. Halpern, That is correct, but the way it operated nui
only with Mexico but any other place is that the SAS people
reported through the Chief of Station. The Chief of Station's
messages were then sent to Washington, and all messages were
addressed to the Director and the cable secretary who made the
distribution because of the necessary slugs that were on there.

Senator ‘Schweiker. Now, following that same line of though
how did the JMWAVE station report?

Mr. Halpern. Well, JMWAVE was TFW's, or then SAS's, field

Mr. Halpern. Field station.

Senator Schweiker. I'm sorry, field station.

Senatoz Schweiker. And that was the only field station thak

SAS had.

Mr. Halpern. JMWAVE had a sub-base, not a station, but
they had some: people.scattered through the Keys, the Florida
Keys, and there was a small unit near Key West, which was
basically responspible for taking care of the boats and other
activities of that type, and some training areas, but basically
the station was JMWAVE, and we didn't correspond directly with
the Key West element, either. We went through JMWAVE.

Mr. Johnston. In your previous testimony before the
Committee, as I copied the quote, "Military intelligence units
were involved in working with Cuban exiles in the Miami area,
and the Florida area along similar lines of CIA."

My question is, would you elaborate on this activity?

Mr. Halpern. I don't know too much about it. The militar:
then, as now, are supposed to coordinate their activities with
us. In operations against Cuba, they not only coordinated
them, but we provided, the CIA and TFW and SAS actually provides

both communications facilities for agents, including agent

gear, agent radio gear, as well as using our boats to piggy-bavs

on our activities going in and out of Cuba, so that we actual

did put from time to time one or more military agents into

Cuba.

We didn't always know the identity of the military agen

don't tell each other our sources. But we do try to check
as much as we can, and when the military coordinated with us,
they tried to give us enough information to be sure that we are
not going after the same body or stumbling over each other.

Mr. Johnston. Did this relationship exist in the fall of
1963?

Mr. Halpern. To the best of my knowledge it did.

Mr. Johnston. And what Defense agencies were involved?

Mr. Halpern. DIA and Army Intelligence, to the best of

| my knowledge. I don't think the Navy was involved, and I don't

think the Air Force was involved, but I'm not sure about that.

Mr. Johnston. In describing these operations, they are
distinct from operations being run out of Guantanamo.

Mr. Halpern. ‘That is correct, that's correct. The ones
I'm talking about are the ones run out of the Florida area,
basically.

Mr. Johnston. Who were SAS's contacts in the Defense
Department in the fall of 1963?

Mr. Halpern. I don't know the answer to that. I'm not
sure. I did not conduct the liaison myself, so I'm not sure.

Mr. Johnston. Was General Lansdale still in the Defense
Department at that time?

‘senatorsSchweiker. Well,’ when he got. into Cuban’ activities

in what way did he coordinate or not coordinate with what SAS
was doing?

Mr. Halpern, If I can change the terminology for a minute,
Senator, SAS was after the missile crisis, and I think General
Lansdale left the Cuban activity after the missile crisis in
+62, so it would have been Task Force W. Such coordination, if
there was any, was with the Chief of the Task Force Bill Harvey,
ard I just don't know.

Senator Schweiker. Then there might not have been too
much coordination.

Mr. Halpern. As far as I know there might not have been.
here was no requirement on his part to coordinate with us. Ther
was a requirement on our part to coordinate with him, and we
dia report to him weekly on all of our activities and proposed
activities, some in response to his direction in which he
requested reports on things he asked us to do, directed us to
go, and some of our own ideas which we checked with him before
we did it.

Senator Schweiker. WELL, the way his set-up worked, did
he have any field stations or any troops, so to speak, to cali
on, or was this more of a planning operation?

Nr. Halpern. It was a coordinating operation.

troops, because i think as I mentioned to the conmittes Last
time,.General Lansdale’s original idea, approved by the
Attorney General but not approved by the President, after
objection by the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense
and the DCI, General Lansdale's original idea in the fall of
when it started was to take actually troops from each of the
agencies concerned, Defense, CIA and State, and create in
effect a small new agency of its dwn directly under the Attorney

General.

Now, this was objected to by the two Secretaries and the

Senator Schweiker. And was never implemented?

Mc. Halpern, That part was never implemented. We stayed
with CIA, and I'm sure the military, and I know that State,
each component stayed within its own chain of command.

Senator Schweiker. So your group, either Task Force W
or SAS. would have had the main thrust of what activity was going
on.

Mr. Halpern. ‘That is correct.

Senator Schweiker. Now, you did mention DIA and Army
Intelligence, but the main thrust of what you were doing went
through your operation.

Mr. Johnston. One other question.on this .topic is.that
generally. the concept:-most people have of DIA is that it
relies solely on the services for.intelligence activities.

Mr. Halpern. Uh-huh.

Mr. Johnston. Are you saying in this case DIA did have
its own assets?

Mr. Halpern. I can't say that for certain. DIA may have
been representing the Army when they came to talk to us about
things. They were supposed to coordinate and be aware of what
the Army was doing at all times, but I know we talked about
DIA and to Army Intelligence, and I am not sure at this point
whether each one ran its own, or whether they even talked to
each other. This was kind of really in a coordinating game
with Defense.

Senator Schweiker. At the time that you were in both
Task Force W.and SAS, Sam, who was Station Chief or Chief of
Station of JMWAVE?

Mc. Halpern. During that whole period Ted Shackley,
Theodore Shackley. He is still in the Agency as far as I
know.

Mr. Halpern, No, sir, despite what the Committee's report
has printed, he was not in Paris on November 22nd. He was
hosting a luncheon at the City Tavern, and #£ the City Tavern's
records are still available, they should prove that point. And

DMre Halpern Well, we heara his threats against the
President, but it never occurred, at least to my knowledge, to
sit down and ask somebody to do a paper or do a review or
anything like that. I just never was involved in any question
like that. It just never struck us in terms of the AMLASH
operation because while Castro may have known about the AMLASH
operation, AMLASH continued to move in and out of Castro's
circles I think for a couple of years thereafter before he was
arrested and tried.

Senator Schweiker. Well, let's remove it for a minute fron
AMLASH. Wouldnt this be a question, knowing of thé other anti-
Castro efforts in terms of assassination planning with both
Task Force W and here, that you would largely assume that this
is one of the risks that we undertook, and that this could wel!
be a consequence of what we might be doing? Didn't somebody
bring up something like that as part of the contingencies?

Mr. Halpern. They may have, Senator, I just was never

Mr.: Johnston, you mean Oswald.

Mr. Halpern. Oswald. I mean Oswald, I'm sorry,

And as long as we're on that subject, talking series, then
and now, even to this date, the one thing that disturbs me as
a professional and as a citizen is nobody has ever been able to
zero in on -- I don't think you can ~~ but nobody has ever
zeroed in on what Castro did in the Soviet Union for the:.couple
of years that he was there. Nobody had a clue where he went,
what he did, what he saw, what he was up to, He marries a
Russian girl, and suddenly, out of the clear blue sky, she gets
exit visas, which is very abnormal.

Mr. Johnston. I. think again you said Castro.

Mr. Halpern. I'm sorry. I meant Oswald. And this has
always disturbed me. I don't know where we can get the answers.
The Russians aren't going to give us anything, obviously. I
don't believe what Nosenko said, simply because Nosenko's
bona fides have never been established, to my knowledge. | And
this is one big area which was never covered in all of the
TV shows and all of the newspaper stories, and all of the
millions of words that have been written and spoken about the
Kennedy Assassination?

It's a question. That doesn't say there's any connection

raised.

Senator Schweiker. Did any of the groups that you recall
working with directly or indire tly deal with these Fair Play for
Cuba Committees as part of your operations, either infiltrating
them or keeping an eye on them? :

Mr, Halpern, Neither SAS nor TFW, to my knowledge, no.

Senator Schweiker, Not to your knowledge.

Mr, Halpern. No, sir, not at all.

Senator Schweiker. This would have probably come under
what, counterintelligence?

Mr. Halpern. Under the FBI, because we were not involved
in this at all.

Senator Schweiker. How about like Alpha 66? Would this
have been something that Task Force W or SAS would have
been interested in or directing or financing?

Mr. Halpern. To the best of my knowledge, we looked at
Alpha 66 originally mostly because of the nuisance value, and
they were a pain in the neck in.terms of getting their boats
in our way most of the time. We never tried to work out, to

Mr. Johnston. Do you know whether anyone in SAS ~-

Senator Schweiker. Along the same line of the other
question, did you ever come across a military attache who was

stationed in Havana, Lt. Colonel Samuel Cale, who I believe at

Samuel Cale. Now, again, he is not CIA. He probably was Army

relations in '60, I believe, so I don't remember those:names.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever see any written orders to
SAS or to anyone in CIA to conduct an investigation of the
assassination of President. Kennedy?

Mr. Halpern. I never saw any such orders, no, sir.

Mr. Johnston. Did you personally see any oral orders, or
do you know of any oral orders to other than SAS to conduct
such an investigation?

Mr. Halpern. The only thing I know of were the file checks)
that were made ad nauseum on everything connected with Oswald.
Even the slightest inkling was checked, double checked, and
file traces were run and cables were sent out to all parts of
the world which might have had any possible connections with
this.

Mr. Johnston. Now, when you are saying traces and cables
being sent out, were these cables being sent out by SAS and the
traces by SAS?

Mr. Halpern, SAS sent out some. SAS coordinated on others.
It was under the direction of the CI Staff, to the best of my
recollection, and we were just doing what we were asked to do
in terms of doing traces.

Now, a trace, once you get a trace request, you just stare

Mr. Johnston, Was John Whitten in SAS?

Mr. Halpern. John Whitten, at that point, to the best of
my knowledge, was on WH Division.

structure for the investigation. The GPFLOOR crypt was used
to designate the CIA activity between the time of the assassinatjin
and the time the Warren Commission got rolling, and that Mr.
Whitten was or had principal responsibility in that period, whid
may have.been a period of a month or more before Mr. Rocea of

Mr. Halpern. No, sir. They were supposed to, bit rules
are not always followed.

Mr. Johnston. After the assassination of President
Kennedy, was anything done with regard to using the JMWAVE
assets to investigate the assassination?

Mr. Halpern, I don't remember anything special except
that they were asked to also check their files and to investigath
through their sources in the Cuban exile community anything and
everything that they could come up with on Oswald and any of
his activities.

Mr. Johnston. Was there a message to that effect?

Mr. Halpern, There probably was. I couldn't vouch for it.
The only way JMWAVE would get that kind of information or
directive would be by either a cable or a dispatch, and most
likely it would be cables.

Mr. Johnston. Did the CIA at this time period that we
are talking about have an arrangement with Customs whereby
Customs agents were detailed or affiliated or loaned to CIA

in the Plorida area?

Halpern. She was on the CI Staff, and at that time I
think in liaison with the Bureau, and I think aiso had some
other liaison responsibilities with other intelligence and
security services in the community.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know or would you suspect whether
she was knowledgeable of the AMLASH operation?

Mr. Halpern. If she was, we've got lousy security, or
we would have had lousy security at that time if she knew about

at him and a dozen other people then I would-«not have. questioned
it at all, even at that time.

Mr. Johnston. And the name trace would have given what?

Mr. Halpern. The name trace would have given whatever
we knew about the individual except our operational contacts
with him. It would be biographic information,

Mr. Johnston. Well, if CI Division asked for information
on AMLASH, éven if they were furnished biographical information
it would not contain the fact that he was involved in some
assassination plot.

Mr. Halpern. That's correct. That would normally go
to the case officer concerned, who would be alerted by the name
tracers that somebody had asked for AMLASH.

Mr. Johnston. And what would the case officer have done
in that case?

Mr. Johnston, But again, in the context of investigating
the assassination of President Kennedy, and the indication that

Mr. Halpern. No, because again, even if it happened that
way, it would have been up to the case officer to tell ritzgerald
that somebody has asked for the file. The file would then be
handed by Mr. Fitzgerald to whatever element needed it. In
other words, it wouldi't be handled routinely. In other words,

to time we helped them, and we helped them in terms of intercedi|
with HEW, with monies that they might have been getting from
HEW. That's all.

Mr, Johnston, Catholic Charities and Catholic Cuban
Relief was also involved, is that right?

Mr, Halpern, That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Was there a liaison between the Catholic
Charities and CIA?

Mr. Halpern, Not that I know of, Not an official one.
There may have been an unofficial one down in Miami, but I

don't know, or one in New York, for that matter.

Mr. Halpern, Not that I know of.

Mr. Johnston. Let me go then to 1967, What was your
position in 1967?

Mr, Halpern, Iwas the executive assistant to the DDP,
first Mr. Fitzgerald from January to the day he died, which
was July 23rd, I believe, '67, and then Mr. Karamessines who
replaced him.

Mr. Johnston, Well, then, did you know other than as a
witness that there was an IG inspection on assassinations taking]
place?

Mr. Halpern. Yes,

Mr. Johnston. . And you knew that in your official
capacity?

Mr. Halpern. No, no. I only know because I talked -- I
was asked about it.

Mr, Johnston. So you don't know whether Mr. Karamessines
came and asked.

Mr. Halpern. The first I know, I was asked to come and

to King Greer, who was the IG officer involved.

Mr. Johnston, Did you, in 1967, see the IG report?

Mr. Halpern. No, sir.

Mr, Johnston, Did Mr. Fitzgerald see it?

Mr. Halpern. I don't know.

* ey Halpern, I asked-Kenei Greer, and to the best of my
recollection he said the Director wanted it. That.was good
enough for me. The Director then was Mr.. Helms.’ I was not in
the habit of questioning the Director's wishes.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall when you were first aware that
there was such an investigation taking place?

Mr. Halpern. No, no, I don't know the day or the month or
anything like that. It was while Fitzgerald was still alive,
so it had to be sometime before he died in July.

Mr. Johnston. Did Mr. Greer ask you about any connections
between the Kennedy assassination and CIA plots against Castro?

Mr. Halpern. No. The only comment I think he made was
something to the effect that it was strange and ironic that the
day Kennedy died the case officer was trying to give AMLASH
a poison pen. That is the only connection that I remember.

Mr. Johnston. And to your knowledge, had all plotting but
AMLASII stopped prior to November of 19637

Mr. Halpern. I only knew about AMLASH. I.didn't know
about anything else.

Mr.Johnston. That was the only operation you knew that
was active at the time against Castro.

Mr. Halpern. That is the only thing I was involved in.

Mr. Johnston. Were you ever, again in 1967, told about the

Mr. Johnston. When Mr. Karamessines took over, did you tel

him about the fact that there was an IG inspection on assassi-

nations?

Mr. Halpern. No. I was told when I talked to Mr. Greer
not to talk about it, and I didn't.

Mr. Johnston. and other than Mr. Greer, you talked to
no one else at the CIA about it in 1967.

Mr. Halpern. Well, I then talked to the 1G himself when
he called me back up to go over: some of the points.

Mr. Johnston. Mr. Earman?

Mr. Halpern, Jack Earman,

Mr. Johnston. And what was the nature of that?

Mr. Halpern. Just to go over the same things over again
that I had gone over with Greer. He wanted to be sure that
what I said was what I.said, I mean, what he had on his paper
was what I said, that's all. But he again told me not to talk
about this, and I didn't.

Senator Schweiker. Did Bobby Kennedy have a desk or
work out of any area of CIA during the time you were in your

Donovan's headquarters or office was a very VIP type of arrange-|

that, because that has been used from time to time by other

Mr. Halpern. When Senator Humphrey was Vice President,
his liaison with the Agency used one of those offices down there}
I think his name was George Carroll. He used to be training

was down there, and so we did a lot of Matson with them.

Mr. Johnston, We discussed basic facts about possible
Cuban or strange events that point toward Cuba, and let me ask
you if you knew, to put you back in the environment of 1963,
if you had known about this flight from Mexico City to Havana
on the afternoon of the assassination, and if you had known abouk
the Lopez travel and the Porta-Villa allegation, and the fact
that AMLASH or AMLASH's nama had come up in the course of the
Mexico City investigation, would you have felt that those
facts would have justified a more complete investigation?

Senator Schweiker. If you had known them at the time.

Mr. Johnston. If I had known them at the time, I sure
would have tried to find out more about them, and I would have
sat down and really sat down with Porta-Villa and asked hima
hell of a lot more, and tried to find out where he got the
information, how, the reliability of his source and so on, and
I sure would have worked with the Mexican police to try to find
out more about those flights.

I don't --/ this is all new to me, and if it hadn't, somethif.

no followup on it. Especially since it affected Cuba, wouldn't
a followup have been within SAS?

Me. Halpern. If 4t had to deal with working with, the
Mexican Government and following it up, no, the action would havp
been the WH Division, using SAS people in: the Mexican station,
but the action would have gone to the Chief of Station for
his action, since he had the liaison with the Mexican police
and the internal security people.

Mr. Johnston. With regard to the Lopez matter, again in
March of that year, March of 1964, the Mexico City station was
informed through a source of unknown reliability that Lopez
was somehow involved in the assassination.

You don't recall receiving that information?

Mr. Halpern. It may have crossed my desk, but I just don't
remember. I think I might have remembered if I had seen it.

Mr. Johnston. And is it your testimony that SAS did not
form a task force.or any kind of organized effort to investigaty
Cuban connections?

Mr. Halpern. Not that I know of, We responded to, I know,
the CI Staff in terms of traces and whatever else they asked
for, but-we did not organize our own task force.

Senator Schweiker. Chief of what?

Mr. Halpern. Foreign Intelligence.

Senator Schweiker. In SAS.

Mr. Halpern. in SAS, we each had the components. We had
the CI unit, an PI unit, and a covert actions unit, just small
branches.

Senator Schweiker, What were they?

Mr. Halpern. Foreign Intelligence, Counterintelligence,
and covert actions.

Senator Schweiker. They were the three basic elements.

Mr. Halpern. The three basics, and oh, one more, para-
military, which was technically part of covert action but was
set up as a separate branch because of the heavy involvement
in paramilitary activities, but Ed Morelius was Chief of the

Mr. Halpern. No, because it wouldn't have been useful

street, if it had been thrown away, they wouldn't use it as
a pen. It couldn't have been used as a pen.

Mr. Johnston. What if AMLASH had taken the pen with him?

Mr, Nalpern. I think if he took the pen with him, if he
was going to use it, he would have had a complete change of
heart.

As he told the case officer, he thought it was silly and
it wouldn't work, and if he took it, I don't know why he would

Mr. Halpern. No, no, because if he wanted to get rid
of Castro he would have gone ences and gotten rid of Castro
anyway, whether ‘Kennedy: was assassinated or not... If he was
going to have a coup, he was going to have a coup. The fact
that he didn't -- the pen didn't surface at his trial leads
me to believe that he either -- A, he didn't take the pen, or
B, if he took it, he didn't use it, he threw it away.

Mr. Johnston. You were present at the time and I was not.

Let me just put to you the fact that if ANLASH had
possession of that pen, CIA was in a very compromising
position.

Mr. Halpern. Not true. He couldn't prove that CIA
gave it to him.

Mr. Johnston. Although he could identify the case officer||

Mr. Halpern. No, he couldn't. The case officer was
under some kind of a pseudonym.

Mr. Johnston. But he could identify him by face.

Mr. Halpern. Well, he'd have a difficult time trying to
find him, coming up with a drawing, a police --

Mr, Johnston. That any attempt to investigate Castro and
Castro's motivation vis-a-vis Kennedy might be very difficult
if AMLASH had kept the pen.

Mr. Halpern. No, I didn't. As I say, the fact that the
pen never surfaced in the course of the trial -- it was a big
show trial as I remember. It was an indication to me that a,
he didn't take it, and if my initial information was correct,

Just your recollection, what kind of a role was Army intelligencp
playing with the Anti-Castro activities at the time? I ama
little puzzled just as.to why the role was even there at all in
what they were doing. : i

What existed then that does not exist now in terms of
Army intelligence, of what mission they had?

Mr. Halpern. Army intelligence was to get tactical or
strategic intelligence from clandestine sources, and they were
in there trying to do as much as they could, getting intelligence
on Cuba and what the Soviets might be doing on Cuba.

Mr. Johnston. But if they were working with a group
such as Alpha 66, it was more, it would get into the paramilitay
covert field, would it not?

Mr. Halpern. It would.

Senator Schweiker. Who would have been directing that
Army intelligence setup at that time?

Mr. Halpern. I don't remember who it was, and I don't
remember who the chief of the intelligence unit was at that
time, and again, they may have been dealing with Alpha 66
for intelligence purposes, and Alpha 66 could have been using
some of that money that they got for paramilitary.

Senator Schweiker. For paramilitary purposes,

Mr. Halpern. In other words, I'm not saying the Army had

we helped --

the agreement come out, roughly?

Mr. Halpern. Oh, '63, '64, something like that.

detector test that was given to the Nicaraguan, Alvarado, as
to whether or not he in fact was lying or telling the truth

about $6500 going from a black Cuban to Oswald, AlVarada?

it as another file check and not as the answer, and this is why
people say he's on polygraph, he's off the polygraph. That
is fine. You've got to use. it, but don't believe everything
that comes off of that.

And these polygraph operators have learned a lot since
them. What I'm talking about goes-back to about 1950, and in

So it can be done. And it is a matter.of s- well, the
Hindus have been able to control their breathing and respiration]
rates and so on, and people can be trained. - :

So when you mention something about a Nicaraguan being
on a polygraph, it just brought back to mind that's not the
only thing that you have to look at.

Mr.- Johnston. What about the other side? If the polygraph
indicates deception, I assume you put more reliability on
that.

Mr. Halpern.’ No, not necessarily, not necessarily. At
least I don't, and I'm no polygraph operator, but. not necessarill.
To me it is an important check and it should be done, but
it has no greater weight or no lesser weight than good human
sources or documents.

Senator Schweiker. Well, we want to thank you, Sam.

We think you have been very helpful, and we certainly
appreciate it. Nice seeing you again.
