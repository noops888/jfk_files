gambling operation in the Hotel Nacional casino but that

subject had been advised by TUCKER that negotiations with

other individuals concerning the sale of the casino had

already progressed too far. for subject to be considered.

was affiliated with the Tropicana, the casino showed a net

loss in operation, although he had at least been able to

"clean up" the gambling operation in the casino.

noted that, according to the subject, because of poor busi-

ness MARTIN FOX, one of the owners,

had become more and

more concerned over even petty losses by the gambling casino,

with FOX.
