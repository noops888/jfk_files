their association with the Agency. I explained thie Agency's serious

reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and

operations that are still in being. I explained that the Agency con-

tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom

Measrs. Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency

association. Mr. Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem. Thus.

in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the

Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and

Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they

had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily

acknowledged those conditions.

4. I mentioned to Mr. Schult% that il, as a result of the

discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes

that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a

narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee

that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider

it in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offor as to his

nenra, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current

oporations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-

donce of current and polontial Agoney relationships.

A subsequent meeting was scheduled for 8 February with

CANCLATY/ Jand the pr case officer at which time the latter intro

duced him to the CI case officer.

Subject appeared to be pleased

with this turn of events expressing the wish that he could be put

to more frequent use and be given a heavier work load.

He said that

he enjoyed his 21 year association with his previous case officer

but looked forward to getting into a new line of activity, pre

ferably some type of PH activity or investigative work which he

olaime to enjoy as a result of his previous police experience in

Cuba. Jubjeot was told by the Cl case officer that his dutios would

remain essentially the same an- they had been and that he should

continue his coverage of exile notivities with emphasis on any

rumore of impending exile raide on Cuba.

On 10 February Subjeot wun Introduced to AMBLInk/1 and wan

toad that AsLInk l would keep in dally touch with him ofther by

since he may become involved with local underworld elements who

Subject said

that he is well aware of this possibility and is making very

discreet inquiries with the assistance of certain friends (Cuban

ex-policemen) who are bolita runners"and who know that he has no

Interest In their bolita activities per se except to learn the

identities of the two Cuban mulatto women. Subject sald that his

friends, in addition to possibly helping him, would like to know

the identities of the two women sincee they would then play the

the AMSEHVE Unit but rather

continue running him as a singleton

agent.

ll was also felt that he respords more favorably under

the direction and guidance of one case oificer rather than as

& ¿am meuber.

AMCLATTER/1 has performed very well in his new

dutles as refugee debriefer, and

his debriefing reports are

models of

thoroughness, if not of organization.

3.. During the reporting period October-December, AMCLATTER/I

conducted a total of 16 refugee debrielings and prepared reports

Some of the debriefings required as many as four

separate sessions.

In addition, AMCLATTER/1 submitted ten

operational reports dealing with information concerning the

Cuban exile community,

the majority of these stemming from

contacta with Identity A. Two of these were disseminated.

During the period October December 1965 the following

were expended for AMCLATTER/1:

total - $1, 554.31.

FOR AN EVENTUAL COUP AGAINST THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT. ALEJOS

PROMISED GARCERAN THAT IF THE COUP WERE SUCCESSFUL, ALEJOS WOULD

ESTABLISH A CUBAN GOVERNMENT IN EXILE IN GUATEMALA WITH GARCERAN

AS ITS "PRESIDENT."

3. GARCERAN SAID THAT THE PLAN IS MERELY IN THE "TALKING STAGE"

AND STRESSED THAT THERE ARE AS YET NO SPECIFIC PLANS, LOCATIONS,

OR TIMETABLES IN EFFECT.

4. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE HAD MADE SEVERAL. TRIPS TO GUATEMALA,

AND SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED A MEETING HE HAD HAD WITH ROJAS MARROQUI

(FNU) ON 14 SEPTEMBER DURING THE COURSE OF A FOUR-DAY TRIP "THROUGH

THE FRONTIER." ON THE SAME TRIP ALEJOS ALSO MET WITH ABUNDIO

MALDONADO, JOSE LUIS ARENAS, VILLAGRAN KRAMER, TWO BARRIOS PENA

IN ABOUT 11 DIFFERENT HOUSES.

5• ALEJUS TOLD GARCERAN THAT, IN ORDER FOR HIS COUP TO

HAVE ANY CHANCE FOR SL'CCESS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE HAVE THE

FULL SUPPORT OF THE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE. HE ASSURED GARCERAN THAT

HE HAS SUCH SUPPORT.

6. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPLY THE NECESSARY ARMS AND

EQUIPMENT TO THE CUBAN EMIGRES. RECRUITED BY GARCERAN. HE REVEALED

THAT THE LOCATION OF THE TRAINING SITE WOULD BE IN NORTHERN

NICARAGUA, A NECESSARY CHOICE BECAUSE SOUTHERN NICARAGUA IS TO

BE USED BY THE SOMOZA/SCHECK FORCES AS A LAUNCHING SITE FOR A COUP

AGAINST THE GOVERNVENT OF COSTA RICA. (FIELD COMMENT: THIS PROBABLY
