their association with the Agency. I explained the Agency's serious
reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and
operations that are still in being. 1 explained that the Agency con-
tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom
Messrs. Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency
Association, Mr..Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem. Thus,
in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the

” Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and

Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they
had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily
acknowledged those conditions. :

4. I mentioned to Mr, Schultz that if, as a result of the
@iscussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes
that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a
narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee
that-we would approve such a request, only that we would consider
it in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offer as to his
nends, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to cutrent
operations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-
donce of current and po‘ontial Agency relationships.

1. AMCLATTER/1 reported on 19 April 1965 that he had received
that same evening a total of four phone calls from an unidentified
party threatening to kill both his wife and himself.

2, The first three phone calls were received between 1800 and
1830 hours whsveas the fourth call was received at 2130 hours. The
caller spoke fluent English and used extremely vile language insult-
ing to both A/l and his wife. The \conversation during each phone
call was short and made no sense to.A/l who said the caller at one
point identified himself as Jerry (WALKER when A/l asked who was
speaking. A/l has never heard of anyone by this name and believes
it to be fictitious. The caller also said on one occasion, "I've
been hearing the things you said about me up in Fort Lauderdale."
Again, this remark made no sense to A/l, Axi Threatening jae us

when offered by his JUWAVE’C70"thetuse ofan
room or safechouse for the evening, said that he appreciated our

offer but was armed with a 38 caliber revolver and could take care
of himself. He said that his wife and 18 year old daughter agreed
with him about staying in. their own house since they had fled their
home once yefore in PBRUMEN and did not intend to run again, A/1
is of the opinion that the caller is « crank but has not ruled

out the possibility that 1t may be PBRUMEN intel inspired, He

said that ono of his friends (IDEN). also had recently received a
fumber of thr ing phone calls from some who spoke fluent
Gpanish but revused to identify himself by name.
