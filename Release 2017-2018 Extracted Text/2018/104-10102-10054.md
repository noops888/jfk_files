From the time the Mexico Station was opened Gateapai.

909) until

the arrival of Mr. Min Scott: as Chief of Station ( 1955), the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by an. ee of the, local #

‘telephone company who wad, handled by a Station case officer. The number
of lines tapped was’ limited only by the availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites’ were handled by a Station case officer
assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These :
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the: Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED a the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word. that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an’ alternate photo-
graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the.same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of
the block south. It had a Planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of. the Soviet Embassy compound. The
Purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was, then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact. print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early (953) due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of Limite and LILYRIC was

Processed on the outside by a recruited agent.



Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from.the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued’ LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a(unt

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:
In mid-1962, fhe

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post,.a live monitor'made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed’ and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian



+ + Tanguage-other-than Spanish or English were taken to another location
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about. a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of. the
Station started screening all photographs. However, here again,- there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week

* but those picked up were usuatly for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused. film remaining.
The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
photograph all Soviets, their families, al] foreigners, and cars with
foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents
were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated
equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-
ficulties.

Oswald. came to the attention of the listening post operators

from a tap of the Soviet line. It was picked up and-taken to Mr. Boris:

Tarasoff for translation because the caller was trying to speak in Russian.
There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the
photographs withthe typed transcript. All transcripts were made in
either Spanish.or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational ‘leads.
