In Book V of the final report of the Senate Select

Committee to Study Governmental Operations on the performance

of the intelligence agencies in the investigation of the

assassination, the FBI and CIA are criticized for their

apparent failure to fully pursue leads surrounding the

assassination of President Kennedy and then to fully report

to the warren Commission the results of the investigations

they did undertake. One such lead concerned the travel

from Texas to Mexico City of ap unidentified Cuban-

American on November 23, 1963, and then his flight to Havana on

November 27. 1/ The lead was made more "interesting" by

the fact that the Cuban-American reportedly attended a

meeting of the Tampa chapter of the Fair Play

for Cuba

Committee on November 11, 1963. 2/ The House Select

Committee on Assassinations examined the documents connected

to that lead to determine: (a) whether the facts which were

known by the FBI and CIA about that individual warranted

further

investigation and what investigation was undertaken;.

Ib! whether any of that information vas reported to the Warren

Commission; and (c) whether the knoun facts suggest

any.

involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy.

which had been carried out in Key Nest, Florida. The report

stated that Lopez's counsin, Guillermo Serpa Rodriguez, told the

FBI that Lopez came to the United Stated for the first time some :

time after Castro first came to power. 27/ He stayed approximately

one year and then returned to Cuba. 28/ Rodriguez stated that

Lopez returned to Cuba because he was homesick and missed

his family; he had parents and four brothers who still resided

in cuba. 29/

Rodriguez stated also that Lopez's brother Selito was

a member of the Cuban militia at that time. 30/ Another

brother, Raimundo Policarpo Lopez, had reportedly been

sent to the Soviet Union to study by the Cuban government,

according to Rodriguez. 31/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez returned to the United

States in 1960 on 1961 because he was afraid he would be drafted

into the Cuban militia if he remained in Cuba. 32/

The FBI learned that Lopez married an American woman in Key

West in August, 1962. 33/ According to Lopez's wife, he worked

for a time with the Pepsi Cola Co. in 1962 and at the Molina

and Murgia Bakery in Key West, which was owned by cousins. 34/

Lopez's wife told the FBI that Lopez began suffering from

recurrent attacks of epileysy and had to be confined at Jackson

State Hospital in-Key-West in early 1963. 36/ She stated that

he was treated by doctors from Coral Gables and Key West for the

epilepsy. 37/ She stated that she did not believe he had a

history of epilepsy before coming to the United States. 38/

She believed his convulsions were brought on by nervous

and worry over his family in Cuba and may have been a reason

tension

for his return to Cuba in 1963. 39/

The wife said that in approximately November, 1963,

she received a letter from Lopez saying he had returned to

Cuba. 40/ The wife stated that she was surprised he had returned

but that he had mentioned he was going back to Cuba when he

left for Tampa in November, 1963. 41/ The wife gave her opinion

that he returned because of his close relationship with his

parents. 42/ The wife stated that she received another letter

from him later from Cuba. 43/: According to the letter, he was

working. as an elevator operator in Havana. 44/ In that letter

Lopez said he had received some kind of financial assistance

vife, Lopez did not have sufficient personal funds to pay the

expenses to Mexico and Cuba. 46/ She said that he had never had

contact with Cuban refugee organizations to her knowledge. 47/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez left Key West

in late 1963 to go to Tampa with the hope of being able

to return to Cuba. 48/ Rodriguez said he believed Lopez wanted

to return to Cuba because he was afraid of being drafted into

the U.S. military. 49/ Rodriguez said Lopez was not involved

in any pro-Castro activity while living in Key West, but that

Lopez was "definitely" pro-Castro. 50/ Rodriguez recounted that

in one instance he and Lopez actually had a fist-fight over

Lopez's pro-Castro. sympathies.

51/

In a report in March 1968, the FBI reported that Lopez

had attended a meeting of the Tampa Fair Play for Cuba Committee

63

on November 20, 197z. 52/ The report also stated that at a

meeting of the group on November 17, 1963, Lopez stated that he

had been refused travel back to Cuba. He said at that time

that he was waiting for a phone call from Cuba to get word on

his departure to Cuba. 53/

According to that report in March, 1964, a member of the

::

Tampa FPCC stated that she called

a friend in Cuba on December 8,

1963

and was told that Lopez had arrived safely. 54/ The member

had attempted to locate. Lopez in Cuba through friends there because

Lopez had not delivered gifts to persons in Cuba from people

in Florida as he had promised to do. 55/ The member stated

also that the Tampa chapter of the FPCC had given Lopez.

approximately $190 for the r'éturn trip to Cuba. 55/ Tha

The March 1964 FBI report listed Lopez's passport as

#310162, which had been issued in January, 1960, and his

Mexican tourist card as

"M8-24553, issued November 20, 1963:

in Tampa. 58/ It stated that Lopez entered Mexico by private

auto at Nuevo Laredo on November 23, 1963 and departed

for

Havana on November 27 as the only passenger on a Cubana flight,

carrying a Cuban courtesy visa. 59/

According to the FBI file, Lopez's mother, Esperanza

Rodriguez, was born in Key West, Florida. 60/ The file

listed three cousins and four uncles who resided and worked in

the Key west area with their families. 61/

Lopez's FBI file contains a memo from the Tampa office

dated October 26, 1964 which states:

It is felt that information developed

regarding the subject is not sufficient

to merit consideration for the Security

Index. 62/

The only information transmitted by the FBI to the warren

Commission on Lopez concerned a check at the Passport Office. 63/

The information the Bureau did send to the Commission a bout the

Tampa chapter of the EPCC did not include any information on

Lopez's activities. 64/ The CIA apparently did not provide

any information on Lopez to the warren Commission. As pointed

out in the Senate report, this omission is made more egregious

---

## Page 11

Cuban- American... page 1l

by the fact that sources had reported within a few days of

Lopez's departure for Havana and of the assassination that the

circumstances surrounding his travel seemed "suspicious" and

that in March, 1964, while the Warren Commission was well

underway into its work into the investigation of the

assassination, Lopez had reportedly been involved in the

Kennedy assassination.

CIA TARFOrCe ReporT.

In the 1977

report of the Inspeator General of the

"Play the Agency attempted to refute several "inaccuracies"

in the Senate report regarding the reporting on Lopez's

•travel. That is

apparently the only follow-up by the

Agency on the lead after the Senate report appeared.

In the first place, The Inspector eneral, report

corrected the statement in the Senate report that sources

reported that Lopez appeared "suspicious" when he was

JFR

surveilled in Mexico. 65/ The It report explained that the

internal CIA document Of December

5 1963.

which characterized

the man as suspicious was merely "cryptic and impressionistic

rather: than constituting. a tangible basis for dramatic:

activity or final conclusions. " 66/

The report stated additionally that the March

1964 cable from the Monterrey base which recounted the

information on Lopez (from the contact of the Mexican police

and claimed Lopez was involved in the assassination was

---

## Page 12

Cuban-American... page 12

incorrect on several points: Lopez's name was misspelled

"Lopes"; it stated that Lopez entered Mexico on foot when

the CIA repeated the FBI's conclusion that he had traveled

by auto; it gave incorrect digits in Lopez's passport

number; it stated that the Mexican tourist visa was issued

in Nuevo Laredo

and not Tampa; and it. reported that. he

stayed at the Cuban Embassy. 67/ Based on these inaccuracies,

the Inspector Pereral concluded that "the source patently

was extensively misinformed." 68/ Based on that observation,

the Inspector General completely discounted the cable

by the Deputy Chief of Station in Mexico

City on March 20

1964) that the Mexican police source information "jibed"

with what had earlier been reported by the CIA's source. 69/

Presumably the discrepancies pointed out by the

TER

Inspecter Genexal are meant to explain the fact that the

CIA did not take more aggressive investigative steps to

ascertain.

whether there might have been some schip

between Lopez and the assassination.

In that regard, the

1977 -Ingpector Gene

report explains that the Agency

had no other means of investigating Lopez at his disposal

and had carried the lead as far

as it was able by

questioning a Cuban defector about Lopez. While the fact

of the CIA's lack of access to further information about

---

## Page 13

Cuban-American... page 13

Lopez may well be the case, that fact does not explain either

the failure of the CIA. to take more seriously the suspicions

of the sources, or most importantly, to report whatever

information it had to

the Warren Commission. In that

TFR

regard, the attempts of the Inspector General to denigrate

the value of the information provided on Lopez do not

The Agency is

not to be faulted for the strength of its intelligence

gathering, but rather for the judgment which kept that

intelligence from the governmental body, the warren

Commission, which was mandated to pass on the strength of

exactly that kind of information.

From the information collected by the FBI, there

appear to be wellsible a reasons both for Lopez's

desire to return to Cuba and his solicitation of the help of a

local FPCC chapter for that travel. His contacts in Florida

Despite the

fact

that Oswald "may" have been in

chapter,, no evidence appoats to suggest that Oswald was

actually in touch with the Tampa EPCC, of that Lopez was

connected in any way with Oswald or Dallas.

## Page 14

Cuban-American..• page 14

Despite what is now known about Lopez, the Warren

Commission may well have wanted to lay to rest

suspicions which would remain about Lopez, and satisfy

itself that these circumstances in no way indicate foreign

involvement in the assassination.. The CIA has contributed

to: those suspicions by not airing. the matter and explaining

circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sinister

appearing events.

The Committee has documented instances where the CIA

decided to forego passing information to the Warren Commission

out of a desire to not lay bare extremely sensitive sources

and methods of intelligence.

The LIFIRE operation

certainly falls

within that category and as soon as the CIA

began receiving information that LIFIRE was the source of

the information about Lopez's travel, the cables and

messages reflected the desire to not reveal that method.

It also seems plausible that the FBI likewise chose not to

divulge what it had learned about Lopez because in doing

so, it would have had to reveal the sensitive CIA operation

which generated the initial information on Lopez's travel to Cuba

on November 27.
