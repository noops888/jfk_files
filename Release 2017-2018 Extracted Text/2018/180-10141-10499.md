In Book V of the final report of the Senate Select

Committee to Study Governmental Operations on the performance

of the intelligence agencies in the investigation of the
assassination, the FBI and CIA are criticized for their
apparent failure to fully pursue leads surrounding the

ass aecinacion of President Kennedy and then to fully report
to the Warren Commission the results of the investigations

they did undertake. One such lead concerned the travel

from Texas to Mexico City of apmunidentiffea Cuban-

American on November 23, 1963, and then his flight to Havana on
November 27. 1/ The lead was made more “interesting” by

the fact that the Cuban-American reportedly attended a

meeting of the Tampa chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee on November 17, 1963. 2/ The House Select

Committee on Assassinations examined the documents connected

to that lead to determine: (a) whether the facts which an

known by the FBI and CIA about that individual warranted *

rther investigation and what -investigation was’ undertaken;

(b} whether any of that information was reported to the Warren -
Commission; and (c) whether the known facts suggest any : _

involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy.

Mexico Station. of the CIA sent a classified message

to CIA headquarters that a source (dentified_as LITEMPO/4) had
requested of the Mexico Chief of Station at 1300 hours

on that date “urgent traces on U.S. citizen-Gilberto P.

Lopez." 3/ The source said Lopez arrived in Mexico on

November 23 en route to Havana and that Lopez had

disappeared with no’ record of his trip to Havana: According

to the niessage, Lopez had a tourist card,carrying number

24553, which he obtained in Tampa on November 20, 1963 and

his passport number was 310162. The message stated that Lopez ..
left Mexico for Havana,on November 27 via Cubana (Airlines) .

The classified message listed the cryptonym LIFIRE as the apt

FBI Investigation

In a report dated August 26, 1964, the FBI documented

the results of its investigation on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez



Cuban-American...page 7

which had been carried out in Key West, Florida. The report
stated that Lopez's counsin, Guillermo Serpa Rodriguez, told the
FBI that Lopez came to the United Stated for the first time some ~
time after Castro first came to power. 27/ He stayed approximately
one year and then returned. to Cuba. 28/ rodriguez stated that
Lopez returned to Cuba because he was homesick and missed

his family; he had parents and four brothers who still resided

in Cuba. © 29/

- Rodriguez stated also that Lopez's brother Selito was

a member of the Cuban militia at that time. 30/ Another
brother, Raimundo Policarpo Lopez, had reportedly been
sent to the Soviet Union to study by the Cuban government,
according to Rodriguez. 31/ E

Rodriguez told the FBI. that Lopez returned to the United
States in 1960 or‘1961 because he was afraid he would be drafted
into the Cuban militia if he remained in Cuba. 32/

.,The FBI learned that Lopez married an American woman in Key.

West in August, 1962. 33/ According to Lopez's wife, he worked

for a’time with the’Pepsi Cola Co. in 1962 and at the Molina’

and Murgia Bakery in Key West, which was owned by cousins. 34/
She said that he also worked-for a construction company in

Tampa in: June, 1963. °35/


Cuban-American...page 8

Lopez's wife told the FBI that Lopez began suffering from
recurrent attacks of epilepsy and had to be confined at Jackson
State Hospital in-Key—West in early 1963. 36/ She stated that’ “:
“he was treated by doctors from Coral Gables and Key West for oes

epilepsy. 37/ She stated that she did not believe he had a
history of epilepsy before coming- to the United States. 38/
She believed his convulsions were brought.on by nervous tension
and worry over his family in Cuba and may have been a reason
for his return to Cuba in 1963. 39/

The wife said that in approximately November, 1963,
she received a letter from Lopez saying he had returned to.
Cuba. 40/ The wife stated that she was surprised he had returned
but that he had mentioned he was going back to Cuba when he
left for Tampa in November, 1963. 41/ The wife gave her opinion
that he returned because of his close relationship with his
parents. 42/ ‘The wife stated that she received another letter

from him later from Cuba. 43/ According to the letter, he was

working as an elevator operator in Havana. 44/ In that letter

Lopez said he had’ received some kind of financial assistance nae

for the trip from an organization in Tampa. 45/ ‘According’ to.the*™

wife, Lopez did not have sufficient personal funds to pay the

xpenses to Mexico and Cuba. 46/ She said that he had ‘never had .

contact with Cuban refugee organizations to her knowledge. 47/-


Cuban-American...page 9

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez left Key West
in late 1963 to go to Tampa with the hope of being able
to return to Cuba. 48/ Rodriguez said he believed Lopez wanted
to return to Cuba because he was afraid of being drafted into
the U.S..military. 49/ Rodriguez said Lopez was not involved
in. any pro-Castro activity while.living in Key West, but that
Lopez was "definitely" pro-Castro. 50/. Rodriguez recounted that
in one instance he and Lopez actually had a fisti£ight over
Lopez's pro-Castro. sympathies. 51/

Ina report in March 2 FBI reported that Lopez
had attended a meeting of the Tampa Fair Play for Cuba Committee
on November 20, qaee 52/ The report also stated that at a
meeting of the group on November 17, 1963, Lopez stated that he
had been refused travel back to Cuba. He said at that time
that he was waiting for a phone call from Cuba to get word on
his departure to Cuba. 53/

According to that report in March, 1964, a member of the

Tampa FPCC stated that ‘she called a friend in Cuba on December 8,

1963 and. was told that Lopez had arrived safely. 54/. The member
had attempted to locate Lopez in Cuba through friends there becausé
Lopez had hot delivered gifts to persons in Cuba from people

in Florida as he had promised to do. 55/ The member stated

also that the Tampa chapter of the FPCC had given Lopez

approximately $190 for the réturn trip to Cuba. 58/
said that Lopez had gone to Cuba by way of Mexico because he did

not have a passport. 57/



wheter

Cuban-American...page 10

The March 1964 FBI report listed Lopez's passport as
#310162, which had been issued in January, 1960, and his
Mexican tourist card as "M8-24553, issued November 20, 1963.
in Tampa. 58/ It stated that Lopez entered Mexico by private
auto at Nuevo Laredo on November 23, 1963 and departed for
Havana on November 27 as the only passenger’ on a Cubana flight,
carrying a Cuban courtesy visa. 59/

According to the FBI file, Lopez's mother, Esperanza
Rodriguez, was born in Key West, Florida. 60/ The file .
listed three cousins and four uncles who resided and worked in
the Key West area with their families. 61/

Lopez's FBI file contains a memo from the Tampa office
dated October 26, 1964 which states:

It is felt that information developed
regarding the subject is not sufficient
to merit consideration for the Security
Index. 62/

The only information transmitted by the FBI to the Warren
Commission on Lopez concerned a check at the Passport Office. 63/

The information the Bureau did send to the Commission a bout the

fampa chapter of the FPCC did not include any information on
Lopez's. activities. 64/ The CIA apparently did not provide ‘

any information on Lopez to the Warren Commission. As pointed

out in the Senate report, this omission is made more egregious


Cuban- American...page 11

by the fact that sources had reported within a few days of
Lopez's departure for Havena and of the assassination that the
circumstances surrounding his travel:seemed "suspicious" -and
that in March, 1964, while the Warren Commission was well
underway into its work into the investigation of the
assassination, Lopez had reportedly been involved in the

“Inthe first plase, Fhe “

the man as suspicious was merely "cryptic and impressionistic
rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic

activity or final conclusions." 66/ iH pt seg ©

and claimed Lopez was involved in the assassination was

incorrect on several points: Lopez's name was misspelled
“Lopes"; it stated that Lopez entered Mexico on foot when
the CIA repeated the FBI's conclusion that he had traveled
by auto; it gave incorrect digits in Lopez's passport

number; it stated that the Mexican tourist visa was issued

in Nuevo Laredo ‘and not Tampa; and it reported that. he
‘stayed at the Cuban Embassy. 67/ Based on these inaccuracies,

presumably the discrepancies pointed out by the

pe 1 are meant to explain the fact that the

CIA did not take more aggressive investigative steps to
ascertain whether there might. have been some connection
between Lopez and the assassination. In that regard, ae —
1977 ee ade explains that the Agency

had no other means of investigating Lopez at his disposal

and had carried the lead as far as it was able by

questioning a Cuban defector about Lopez. -While the fact

of the CIA's lack of access to further information about



Cuban-American...page 13

Lopez may well be the case, that fact does not explain either
the failure of the CIA to take more seriously the suspicions
of the sources, or most importantly, to report whatever
information it had to pe Warren Commission. In that

d@iminich the apparent negligence of the Agency + seriously
pursu€sg the information as it was received. The Agency is
not to be faulted for the strength of its intelligence
gathering, but rather for the judgment which kept that
intelligence from the governmental body, the Warren
Commission, which was mandated to pass on the strength of
exactly that kind of information.

From the Sey iimee collected by the FBI, there

pls :

appear to be phd created reasons both for Lopez’ s
desire to return to Cuba and his solicitation of the help of a
local FPCC chapter for that travel. His contacts in Florida
appear on their face to be innocent asd-nenpotitiea; and not
in any way connected with the assassination.’ \Despite the
suggestion by the Senate report of suspicion in the fact
that Oswald "may" have been ‘in touch with that same FPCC

Ha H8CA kenel. me
chapter, ,no evidence appeass to suggest that. Oswald was

actually in touch with the Tampa FPCC, or that Lopez was

connected in any way with Oswald or Dallas.

a le



Cuban-American...page 14

Despite what is now known about Lopez, the Warren
Commission may well have wanted to lay to-rest
suspicions which would remain about Lopez, and satisfy -
itself that these circumstances in no way indicate foreign
involvement in the assassination.. The CIA has contributed
to-those suspicions by not airing. the matter and explaining
circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sinister
appearing events.

The Committee has documented instances where the CIA
decided to forego passing information to. the Warren Commission
out of a desire to not lay bare extremely sensitive sources
and methods of intelligence. The LIFIRE operation
certainly falls within that category and as soon as the CIA
began receiving information that LIFIRE was the source of
the information about Lopez's travel, the cables and
messages reflected the desire to not reveal that method.

It also seems plausible. that the FBI likewise chose not to
Givulge what it had learnea about Lopez because in doing

so, it would have haa to reveal the sensitive CIA operation
which generated the initial information on Lopez's travel to Cuba

on November 27.
