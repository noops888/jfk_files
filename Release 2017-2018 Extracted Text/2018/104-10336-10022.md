Subject:

CIA-IR-23 Watch Reports of the United States Intelligence Board

In response to informal request CIA-IR-23, CIA has searched the records of the National

Intelligence Program Evaluation Staff (NIPE), including the United States Intelligence

Board Watch Reports, action memorandums, meeting minutes, and chronological files,

for the period January 1963 to May 1964 for information relating to the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy.

The search produced eight United States Intelligence Board Watch Reports from the

period 27 November 1963 - 27 May 1964. I have reviewed these eight documents,

consisting of 14 pages, and have marked portions of six reports as assassination records:

27 November 1963, 24 December 1963, 22 January 1964, 22 April 1964, 29 April 1964,

and 20 May 1964.

Like the President's Intelligence Checklist and the President's Daily Brief, these

document cover mut i not recontin hat the iR and the document not

Once the six marked reports have been included for processing as assassination records,

this response is complete.

RELENUE OF

IN THIS DOCURANT

Barry,

I read through the reports and marked paragraphs relevant to the assassination in six of

the eight reports. The Board almost certainly will want these relevant paragraphs

released in full. Given that these six reports constitute only eleven total pages and that

the information in them is now consigned to the pages of history, it would be nice to have

the entire reports reviewed for release. If this creates a sensitivity or speed-in-processing

problem, see the attached draft memo. I don't know if Jeremy will go for the memo as a

full response to CIA-IR-23. If CIA will not release the six reports with reasonabte

redactions, would you check with Kathy Dyer to see if my memo is unclassified. Let

me know.

Bloc International Developments

The Soviet Bloc does not appear to have taken any new initiatives in the past

fow days, and it has already issued several unofficial but guardedly hopeful commerits.

Sovier Bloc news media continue to reflect Moscow's concern lest a dangerous contro

versy result from allegations that Cswald's acts were motivated by his Marxist political

orientation. (CONFIDENTIAL)

We have discerned no Soviet or Eastern European Satellite military reaction

to the assassination of President Kennedy. A relatively low level of training, con-

sidered normal for this season, appears to be continuing. (SECRET)

cedures together with the Soviet oral statement of 16 November appeared designed to

fifth anniversary of Castro's revolution. Similar preparations were noted last

December for this purpose. (SECRET)

Sino-Indian Border Conflict: We have noted no significant new develop

ments. (CONFIDENTIAL)

4.

Vietnam: The accelerated tempo of Vier Cong activity continues. Al-

though confirmed figures on North Vietnamese military infiltration into South Viemam

remain considerably below those of last year, newly acquired reports from prisoners

are continuing to raise the 1963 totals, and we believe that additional infiltrators

will be confirmed as further reports are received. (SECRET)

A renewed North Vietnamese propaganda campaign for the neutralization

of South Vietnam appears to be under way, with Chinese Communist and Soviet support.

For the first time in nearly a year, the Communist-sponsored National Front for the

Liberation of South Vietnam reiterated its support for an international guarantee of

Cambodia, Laos and South Vietnam, in line with the proposal of Cambodian Premier

Sihanouk. North Vietnamese insistence on the withdrawal of US forces indicates that

Hanoi is not seriously interested in a settlement at this time except on its own ferms.

The North Vietnamese premier reportedly professes to see signs of war weariness among

the American people and says his goverment intends to keep up the pressure in South

Vietnam. (SECRET)

5.

Loos: The "cease-fire" between the neutralists and the Pathet Lao in the

Plaine des Jarres area has proved ineffective and both sides have continued sporadic

artillery firing in the area. Meanwhile, the neutralists have continued their limited

offensive in the Vang Vieng-Ban Namone area along Route 13 north of Vientione

with apparent success. Pathet Loo units reportedly moved to the west of Route 13 and

possibly are regrouping for a counteraltack.. (SECRET)

There are few signs that the Communists are prepared to make any signifi-

cant concessions toward an agreement. While they appear to be seeking talks between

Souvanna and Souphanourong, they have flatly rejected the establishment of joint

patrols to maintain the cease-fire. Their principal objective apparently is to split

the Kong Le forces from collaboration with the FAR. (CONFIDENTIAL)

6.

Cambodia: Peiping's reaction to Sihanouk's accusations of US subversion

ond to the suspension of US aid to Cambodia has been basically cautious, despite state-

ments of all-out Chinese support against any US-supported invasion of Cambodia.

Peiping's public statements have dealt only with the contingency of armed attack and

have not indicated its attitude toward subversive activity across Cambodia's borders.

Peiping and Honoi have made the most of the situation by condemning alleged US

violations of the 1954 Geneva Agreements and declaring their firm support for Cam-

bodian "independence and neutrality.". (CONFIDENTIAL)

Conclusion

" No Communist Bloc country intends to initiate direct military action in

the immediate future. (TOP SECRET) CO

Bloc International Developments

The Soviets, while attempting to assess the new leadership in the US

since the assassination of President Kennedy, have avoided raising new frictions in

Soviet-US relations. They have simultaneously been devoting considerable attention

to their domestic economic problems and to intra-bloc relations. However, we have

noted no significant alteration in their major foreign policy goals vis-a-vis the West

and we note that Khrushcher has recently reaffirmed Soviet support for "national

liberation" movements and has reiterated Soviet "warnings" against a US attack on

Cuba. (SECRET)

Soviet Bloc Military Developments

A further analysis of the Soviet 1964-65 plan and related information leads

us to believe that the chemical program will have a limited but significant effect on

defense procurement during the next two years. (SECRET)

Critical Areas

Berlin and Germany: The possibility continues of incidents arising from

the large number of West Berliners visiting East Berlin during the holidays. Increased

numbers of East German security and military units have been noted along the Wall

in what appears to be precautionary measures. (SECRET)

2

Cuba: No significant change in the status of Soviet forces in Cuba has

been noted during the past week. (SECRET)

Bloc International Developments

Sino-Soviet Bloc policy developments are included in the relevant sections

below. (CONFIDENTIAL)

Soviet Bloc Military Developments

Bloc ground force activity continues to reflect winter training on a scale

generally comparable with that noted last year ot this time. The first restriction this

year on travel of the Allied Military Liaison Missions in East Germany has been imposed

for the period 19-26 January in an area west of Berlin which includes the Letzlinger

Heide-Elbe River North training areas. The restriction is probably intended to screen

an East German field exercise, possibly involving elements of both military districts.

(SECRET)

Critical Areas

Berlin and Germany: Ulbricht's latest proposal for a nuclear-free Germany,

supplementing Khrushchev's end-of-the-year world-wide peace proposal, appears to be

lárgely a propaganda play to boost East Germany's political status. The East German

regime has kept open negotiations on a new pass agreement and the prospect is for pro

tracted and difficult talks. The East Germans have already tried to expand the scope of

the talks and, as part of their negotiating position, have posed conditions they know to

be unacceptable to the West Berlin Senat. The Communists will want to keep the nego-

tiations alive, however, if only to secure tacit Westem acceptance of the principle of

direct talks between the Senat and East Germans. (SECRET)

The rotation of a US battalion to and from Berlin, concluded on l6 January,

brought no Soviet or East German interference. (CONFIDENTIAL)

Cuba: There has been no significant change in the status of Soviet forces in

Cuba. (SECRET)

Khrushchev on 17 January at Kalinin followed a strong condemnation of the

US position in Panama with a pointed reference to the US naval base at Guantanamo as

"Cuban soil" that "must belong to Cuba." He again reiterated Soviet support for Castro's

"five points," strongly stated Soviet willingness to defend Cuba and emphasized that

President Kennedy's "no-invasion" pledge was binding on the new US administration.

While these remarks may have been primarily designed to reassure Castro, these repeated

public statements of support tend to make the Soviet commitment to Cuba more binding.

(CONFIDENTIAL)

Communist China: The authoritative Chinese Communist newspaper, People's

Daily, has echoed Moo Tse-tung's 12 January call for a global struggle on the broadest

possible scale against "US imperialist aggression." People's Daily said all forces in the

world including the American people but excluding "US imperialism and its lackeys"

should form the united front. As a further reflection of Communist China's announced

implacable hostility toward the United States, Peiping is conducting a protest campaign

against US actions in Panama which now rivals and may exceed in magnitude and intensity

a similar campaign against the US during the Cubanicrisis.. While it is less intense than

at the time of the American landing in Lebanon in 1958, it appears to be part of a de-

liberate program to generate widespread anti-US hostility among the Chinese population.

(CONFIDENTIAL)

4.

Vietnam: Viet Cong armed attacks continue at a reduced level. The Com-

munists, however, are sustaining a high level of harassing and terrorist activity aimed

at sapping the resistance of the rural population and paramilitary forces. The focus of

Viet Cong activity remains the delta, but we note that the slow but gradual buildup of

Vier Cong numerical and organizational strength is also continuing in the Communist

Military Region V, the northernmost region of South Vietnam. The scale of this buildup,

in contrast to the low level of Vier Cong activity in this area, suggests a future stepup

of Viet Cong attacks in the north. (SECRET)

FIDENTIAL)

Critical Areas

Berlin and Germany: The Soviet shootdown of a USAF 1-39 over East Germany

on 28 January occurred when the US plane became lost during a routine instrument train-

ing flight over West Germany. This is the first such shootdown of an Allied aircraft over

East Germany since 1953, although there have been numerous inodvertent overflight .

violations in the interim. The 28 January incident followed a Soviet waming on 25

January that US violations of the air corridors would "lead to hard, undesirable conse-

quences." The incident indicates at least continued Soviet sensitivity both to border

violations by Westem aircraft and to any appearance of Soviet weakness on the German

scene. (SECRET)

2.

Cuba: There has been no significant change in the status of Soviet forces in

Cuba during the past week. (SECRET)

The 22 January Soviet-Cuban communique reiterated previously stated Soviet

commitments to defend Cuba in the event of on invasion by the United States. Mention

of Marshals Malinorskiy and Grechko, as well as Cuban military personnel, among the

participants in the Soviet-Cuban talks makes it a virtual certainty that military matters

were discussed. (SECRET)

Vietnam: Vier Cong activity has increased somewhat, notably in the intensity

of armed aftacks, but terrorism continues to comprise the bulk of their effort to control

the population. The situation in the Mekong delta and certain other areas remains

critical, and the government is in a race against time to devise effective counter-

insurgency measures. However, in several provinces where able province chiefs have

been recently installed and military security achieved, popular morale appears to have

improved. (SECRET)

Laos: The internal situation remains highly unstable. The situation is

favorable for Communist gains, but we have thus far discemed no Communist mili-

fary reaction.

(TOP SECRET)

Bloc International Developments

The celebration this week of Khrushchev's 70th birthday provided a plat-

form for the other Soviet and pro-Soviet East European leaders to declare their support

for Khrushcher's policies and program. There appears to be no serious domestic

challenge to his position and he has demonstrated a clear intention to continue lo

carry his full burdens of leadership. Khrushchev's announcement on 20 April of a

cut in Soviet production of fissionable materials also suggests that he intends to

continue policies designed to convey a sense of reduced tast-West tensions.

(CONFIDENTIAL)

Reports from refugees who arrived in Hong Kong from Sinkiang Province

of China on 12 April provide evidence that the Chinese Communists have a systematic

program for resettling local inhabitants inland along the entire length of at least the

Sinkiang frontier and have established a 20-mile deep security zone. The refugees"

report of substantial Chinese troop reinforcements to Sinkiang, however, has not been

confirmed by available evidence. (SECRET)

Critical Areas

1.

Cuba: Fidel Castro's 19 April speech on the third anniversary of the Bay

of Pigs and President Dorticos' speech the following day appeai ta mark the initiation

of a new Cuban diplomatic offensive against the US. The Cuban notes of 21 April

indicate that continued US overflights and US occupancy of Guantanamo will be

the chief targets of this diplomatic drive. Castro singled out alleged US provocations

at the Guantanamo naval base for special treatment and tie next day Dorticos con-

demned continuing violations of Cuban air space. Castro stated that Cuba refused

to sanction or legalize these provocations and overflights and warned that the limits

of patience are being "dangerously violated." Fidel indicated a willingness to

utilize the forum of international opinion to publicize these provocations, but at the

same time called for increased combat preparedness of his military forces to resist

"physical aggressions" against Cuba "cost what it will and come what may. " (CON-

FIDENTIAL)

A Cuban defector who had been assigned to a SAM complex in Pinar del

Rio Province has reported that an all-Cuban crew was to be selected in May for on

actual firing of a surface-to-air missile against a dione target. He stated that if

the firing was successful, and the target was destroyed, it would signal the turnover

of control to the Cubans and the withdrawal of most of the Soviet SAM personnel.

(SECRET)

2.

Vietnam: The Viet Cong are maintaining heavy pressure on govemment

forces in the Delta. Some of the recent attacks have been within 10 miles of Saigon

and an increasing number of them occurred during daylight hours when the Viet Cong

are most vulnerable. (CONFIDENTIAL)

3.

Laos: The intemal situation remains highly unstable following the break-

down of the tripartite discussions at the Plaine des Jarres and the ensuing right-wing

military coup attempt in Vientione on 19 April. There is a danger of further precipi-

tate action by right-wing elements. (SECRET)

Thus far, there has been no discemible reaction from the Communists,

other than the expected propaganda, and they probably consider it to their od-

vantage to maintain a wait-and-see attitude. If the coalition govemment should

collapse or be removed, the Communists may move to establish a separate "liberation"

govemment. There have been a number of reports since lost December that the

Pathet Loo and dissident neutralists have made plans, with Chinese Communist and

North Vietnamese backing, for the establishment of such a government in Phong

Saly Province should the Souvanna goveinment collapse or become too closely

committed to the right-wing faction. We have noted a number of other Communist

moves in recent months which could enable the Communists to exploit a collapse

of the coalition goverment. (SECRET)

Bloe International Developments

The Chinese Communists are unlimbering for a new major anti-Soviet polemic.

On 27 April the Chinese Communists reprinted the Susior report, the CPSU resolution

and the 3 April Pravda editorial attacking the Chinese leadership--Peiping's usual

preparation for a heavy counterattack. These anti-Chinese documents were introduced

by a lengthy and sarcastic editorial note which promised further Chinese refutation of

Soviet "lies, sophistry and abuse" and taunted the USSR over its inability to supply

either a rebuff or a joint condemnation of China. We have noted that the Rumanian

Party Central Committee has demonstrated a remarkable degree of independence in a

resolution published in Scinteia on 26 April proposing again a cessation of Sino

Soviet polemies and further efforts at a negotiated solution. (CONFIDENTIAL)

Soviet Bloe Militory Developments

In East Germany, Soviet military activity appears concentrated on prepara-

tions for the annual demonstrations and displays held during May in the Letzlinger

Heide training area, which may be longer in duration this year than usual. (SECRET)

A marked drop in training activity by Soviet Bloe military forces is expected

over-the forthcoming May Day holidays. (SECRET)

attack, but avoided any commitment to specific Soviet countermeasures in such an event.

The article also asserted that Cuba has the "inalienable right" no take the "necessary

measures to put an end to the intrusion of foreign warplones into its airspace." The

article may herald a propaganda and diplomatic campaign intended to arouse inter-

national alarm over the US overflights. The Soviets and Cubans may hope that agitation

of the issue would in itself induce the US to eventually cuitail or terminate these flights.

Vietnam: The Viet Cong are increasing their pressure against government

forces in the Delta area and in the region around Saigon. The pattem of attacks and of

sabotage actions against lines of communications suggests a Communist effort to isolate

district and provincial centers. (SECRET)

Our cumulative evidence suggests that the Communists are working steadilly

to improve their capabilities for expanded and sustained military operations. Recently

available information indicates expansion in recent months of some facilities associated

with infiltration routes through loos--specifically a staging area in North Vietnam on

Route 12 near the Loos border, and another staging area at Ben Thay on Route 9 in

southern Loos. (SECRET)

3.

Laos: The internal crisis remains unresolved. (CONFIDENTIAL)

Communist attacks against FAR and neutralist positions in eastem Xieng

Khouang Province have increased sharply since 26 April, although Kong Le's main

positions in the Plaine des James area do not seem immediately threatened. Prior to

the coup, there hod been indications that the Communists were improving their

capabilities for attacks in Xieng Khouang Province. A buildup of Communist strength

has been under way in the Tha Thom area southeast of Xieng Khouang town for several

weeks and Communist attacks in this area are also possible at any time. In addition,

the Communists have succeeded in reopening Route 7 from North Vietnam, and heavy

convoy movement over this road was reported in early and mid-April. (SECRET)

In south-central Loos, truck convoys have been reported over routes leoding

toward Tchepone and Muong Phine. (SECRET)

Within the past several weeks, there have been a number of unconfirmed

reports suggesting an increased Chinese Communist military presence in Loos. Some

Chinese Communist military personnel are reported to have arrived in Nam The and

Phong Saly Provinces during February and March. We now have unconfirmed reports

of the presence of Chinese military personnel in Xieng Khouang Province. We are unable,

on the basis of present information, to determine the numbers or mission of these personnel.

(SECRET)

Laos: The Communist capture of the Plaine des Jarres and other positions in

southeastern Xieng Khovang Province will place them in control of almost all of Loos

except for the Mekong Valley. We believe that current Communist operations will

stop short of attacks against major positions in the Mekong Valley, We believe, how-

ever, the Communists can bring to bear the necessary forces to accomplish their

objectives involving ultimate control of Loos ot times generally of their own choosing.

In our juogment, the primary limiting factor is their desire to avoid escalation by

stimulating US counteractions. The Communists can be expected to proceed at a cal-

culated pace within this frame of reference with their program. (TOP SECRET)

Bloe International Developments

The Soviet Union has focused specific attention during the past week on its

support of "national liberation" struggles. In Egypt, Khrushcher has repeated standard

Soviet statements of support for revolutionary movements in colonial areas. The Soviet

Ambassador in Hanoi at a press conference there restated the Soviet pledge of support

for North Vietnam's aims in South Vietnam. Simultaneously, Soviet propaganda media

hove carried a number of statements on Cuba, condemning alleged US backing of

Cuban exiles, linking the U-2 overflights to these exiles, and reminding the West of

the still rogue Sovier defense commitment to Cuba. (CONFIDENTIAL)

The Rumanian regime reportedly has been conducting an unprecedented

anti-Russion campaign among the populace within the past week. The campaign may

presage new steps by Bucharest to demonstrate Rumanian independence and will further

complicate Soviet relations with other Communist countries. The campaign will arouse

popular hope for liberalization, although the regime has given little indication of

abandoning its hardline internal policies. (CONFIDENTIAL)

Soviet Bloc Military Developments

Soviet air operations during the past week included reconnaissance flights

against the USS Shangri-La in the North Atlantic on 15 May by four TU-95/BEARs

and against the USS Midway in the North' Pacific on 17 May by six BISONs. In both

instances fighters from the US aircraft carriers intercepted and escorted the Soviet

heavy bombers while they were in the area. This represents a resumption of recon-

naissance flights after several months' lapse. (SECRET)

Activity in the Group of Soviet Forces, Germany, has been at a low level

since the May Day holidays. It now appears that the annual demonstrations in the

Letzlinger Heide area, normally conducted during May, were concluded on 28 April

and were more limited in scope than in previous years. We have as yet no indications

as to the reasons for this change. (SECRET)

Critical Areas

Cuba:

The recent delivery of from 10 to 20 additional missile canisters andi

associated components to one SAM site in each of the three air defense sectors, as well

as to the Siguaneo site on the Isle of Pines, indicates that on site support areas are

being established in selected defense areas. We cannot exclude the possibility that

some of these sites may also have been chosen for live practice firings during the coming

weeks. (SECRET)

Both Sovier and Cuban propaganda is now linking the US high-altitude

reconnaissance program to the exile raids by stating that the former provide detailed

information on Cuban military installations which is used in planning and executing

raids on Cuba. (CONFIDENTIAL

2.

Vietnam: Vier-Cong activities are increasing again in number and severity

after a gradual three-week decline, with an emphasis on armed attacks in the Dello

and the area around Saigon. In the north along the low coastal plain, Viet Cong actions

continue to consist principally of harassments and terrorism directed against the populace

in the New Rural Life Hamlers. The coastal railroad continues lo be a special target

for Vier Cong sabotage. (SECRET)

We have noted several recent low-level reports indicating a possible buildup

of Viet Cong forces in Tay Ninh Province, northwest of Saigon. Cambodian acquiesence

in Vier Cong activity in Sray Rieng opposite the critical Tay Ninh area will further

facilitate Communist operations there. (SECRET)

Note is also taken that the sizeable concentration of Viet Cong forces in

Military Region V has experienced relatively limited military commitment to dato.

Bloc International Developments

The USSR's general behavior on the international scene appears aimed

at avoiding a direct confrontation with the US over current crises. Khrushcher's

recent remarks on the issue of US overflights di Cuba are belligerent, and the

Soviets have documented for the record a justification for a U-2 shootdown, but

at present this appears designed as pressure to deter the US from overflights. (SECRET)

exercises are now anticipated with the level of training increasing as the summer

Cong military activities. A few small-scale attacks have been reported recently,

but terrorism and road sabotage continue to predominate. (SECRET)

r to eliminate the Kong Le troops from Route 7 and open the route westward. South

of the Plaine des Jarres, the Pathet Loo also are continuing attacks against Meo

guerrilla bases in an attempt to eliminate the major remaining source of opposition

to Communist control of Xieng Khouang Province. (SECRET)

There are reports of Communist movements in southern Laos which could

indicate preparations for action in the Attopeu and Saravane areas. (SECRET)

The Communist nations have laid the propaganda groundwork for a

withdrawal of recognition from the Souvanna government by their repeated

has reportedly threatened that the Communist nations may break relations with

Vientiane. (CONFIDENTIAL)

The French call for the reconvening of the Geneva conference on

Laos, which was promptly endorsed by Moscow, has been followed by a proposal

from Peiping that the conference be held in Cambodia in June. None of the

proposals have acknowledged Souvanna's conditions for a conference or included

provisions for a cease-fire. All proposals, however, have been made in such a

context as to leave room for consideration of all Indochina as well as Laos. The

North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao attitudes toward a conference are not yet known.

Bloc International Developments

The USSR's general behavior on the international scene oppears aimed

at avoiding a direct confrontation with the US over current crises. Khrushchev's

recent remarks on the issue of US overflights of Cuba are belligerent, and the

Sovlets have documented for the record a justification for a U-2 shootdown, but

at present this appears designed as pressure to deter the US from overflights. (SECRET)

Soviet Bloc Military Developments

The tempo of training within Bloc ground force elements in Eastern

Europe is beginning to rise. Large-scale movements to the field for field training

exercises are now anticipated with the level of training increasing as the summer

training cycle gets under way. (SECRET)

Critical Areas

Vietnam: There has been no discernible change in the pattern of Viet

Cong military acfivities. A few small-scale attacks have been reported recently,

but terrorism and road sabotage continue to predominate. (SECRET)

Recent aerial photography of truck concentrations and traffic along

Koute 12 in North Vietnam toward south-central Laos suggests some increase in the

southward flow of Communist personnel and/or supplies from North Vietnam along

Route 12. (SECRET) (NOFORM EX CERTAIRIT

AND CANADIANS)

2.

Laos: Continuing Communist pressure will probably be directed against

neutralist forces north of the Plaine des Jarres and appears to indicate an attempt.

Subject:

CIA-IR-23 Watch Reports of the United States Intelligence Board

In response to ARRB's informal request for additional information and records

CIA-IR-23, CIA has searched the records of the National Intelligence Program

Evaluation Staff (NIPE), including the United States Intelligence Board Watch Reports,

action memorandums, meeting minutes, and chronological files for the period January

1963 to May 1964 for information relating to the assassination of President John F.

Kennedy.

The search produced eight United States Intelligence Board Watch Reports from the

period 27 November 1963 to 27 May 1964. I have reviewed these eight documents

consisting of 14 pages and have marked portions of six reports as assassination records:

27 November 1963, 24 December 1963, 22 January 1964, 22 April 1964, 29 April 1964,

and 20 May 1964.

Like the President's Intelligence Checklist and the President's Daily Brief, these

documents cover multiple topics. I recommend that the portions of the document not

believed to be relevant to the Kennedy assassination be declared NBR and redacted.

Once the six marked reports have been included for processing as assassination records,

this response is complete.

Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CLA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered - including some that were made more thän two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**) and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for

information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Barnes Capehart, CLA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City, CLA-IR-21 DRE

**CIA-IR-22 "A" File on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

In July 1997, the ARRB staff was shown an "A" file on Clay Shaw which pre-

dated a 201 file. We were also told that an "A" file on Jim Garrison also existed.

The Shaw file was declared to be an assassination record and it was our

understanding that both files were to be sent to HIRG for processing. We have

not yet received confirmation from HRG that the files are in process as

assassination records.

CLA-IR-23 Watch Committee Files:

In his memoirs, George Ball reports that upon first hearing of the shots in Dallas.

he called DCI John McCone and asked him to activate the Watch Committee.

McCone replied that he already had. The Review Board requests the files of the

Watch Committee for the period January 1963-May 1964.

CIA-IR-24 Defector File.

The ARRB staff has identified documents on Lée Harvey Oswald from the Office

of Security's "Defector File." It is our understanding that these documents are

now being processed as assassination records. No further tasking on this subject

is anticipated.

CIA-IR-25 Zapruder Film.

The Board has requested any and all records, not previously located in the

Sequestered Collection; on any handling by the CIA of the Zapruder film. In

particular, we are interested in any records of NPIC's handling of the Zapruder

film or copies of the Zapruder film in November and December 1963. Any log

books or indexes which would indicate the individuals involved in the

processing and handling of any assassination films should be inclyded in this

request.

CIA-IR-26 Jordan James Pfuntner.

The Review Board requested that a complete search for any records on this

individual be undertaken, including a search of the Interagency Source Register

The ARRB staff provided HRG with additional identification data on this

individual. The Review Board seeks a full and accurate formal response to this
