KATOWICE Province Administration. :

“TAKRZEWSKI then explained ‘that he was authorized td offer: SOURCE a atraight
deal. which, ff: SOURCE only cared to consider It realistically, would ‘turn out to
“their riutual benefit. SOURCE's personality, particularly Nis academic education
- and chia reputation as a painter together with hia knew: loyal attitude ‘towards’
‘the state, qualified SOURCE as the ideal partner {a-a somewhat delicate under

taking... The’ personalities of influence, for whom Mr. TAK KT was authorised
“f0speak; could: not think of any one . with ‘quali ficati teér tian SOURCES:

SOURCE replied that, of course; lie, would giadly become a partner’ to any efforts
interided ‘to’ promote the arta because they were the only thines he really cared”
for. “SOURCE had, after Hr, ZAKRZEWSKI's' introductory remarks, quite correctly
guessed what was meant by the “straight deal” and-he; therefore, tried to avoid”
i ithe subject. Mr. ZAKRIEWSKI then asked SOURCE frankly how he did vith his

+" painting. . SOURCE could’ only truthfully reply that his art was definitely not
Suited. to provide a living for him and his wife. This was also the reason,
SOURCE emphasized, that he wanted to leave Poland because-he could no longer:
bear to live from his wife's incase. = 7

"This is all well known to us" said Mr. ZAKRIEWSEI, "but do you in all 7
seriousness believe that you will ‘do better in Weat Germany? They have ‘painters
by the thousands and you, as.a newcomer to thia crowd,-will only be sorry to’have
Joined them. You will have to depend on your wife's income more than with us in
Poland"., Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI.then continued that the aid which SOURCE would recoive
would enable him to better devote hinself to hia art because financial worries -
would be taken from his mind. “Is not this a straight deal?", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI
asked, "you help us and We help you, and we know that your help will be worth the
money", When SOURCE asked what was meant by “ua and "we" and what kind of
help" he: was expected to offer, Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI cautiously replied that, before
being more, specific, he would need SOURCE’s agrecment to the proposition.

“Please try to understand", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI said, "I represent, a3 you have seen,
the government, and it is part of the deal that details of your mission will be
‘ : made known.to you the moment we know that: you are willing to help." SOURCE then
a : “s» refused by emphasizing that, as a1 artist, he folt in ae way competent for the
mission which doubtlessly will be assigned to him In German’ His nerves would
not stand the strain and, sooner or later, he would fail, and thus ruin himself,
Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI. accepted SOURCE'S refusal without the slightest.sign’ of dis-
appointment, impatience or anger. He Listened to SOURCK’S words with a friendly
f s; Smile on his face, and commented that’such a reaction was enly natural and even
4 . reasonable froma man like SOURCE, and it was only furthér proof of SOURCE's
| le

inordinate intellisence and intecrity. He assured SOURCK that there was no
hurry, and important things quite naturally need sume tide to be carefully thought
i over. . Inviting SOURCE to carefully reconsider the offer, he asked for permission
j it to approach the matter a second ‘tine in a few weeks. im this occasion, SOURCE
i

i

should be prepared, after Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI's telephone call, to cone to the hotel
i "BRISTOL" on ULICA PIERSZEGO MAJA" (First of May Road), where matters could be
: aH ‘ discussed more easily. SOURCE agreed to this arranvement because he was afraid
that, by a flat and uncompromising refusal, be would jeopardize his exit permit.

The hotel "BRISTOL" was an impreasive four-storied building with a tavern

i and a night-club;-which had been renovated in 1960. It vas patronizéd by well-to-
do members of the intelligentsia and tourists. He renembered having heard from
fellow members of his painters’ club that the secret police had rented a wing in
one of the upper stories of this hotel. The rooms, aumber unknown, were said to
be furnished as offices and club rooms.

A. OPERATIONS OF THS BORDER SECURITY TROOPS

1. Border Area

‘The border area was established by a law passed by the National Counell
dated 21 March 1958, which revised the existing law governing the security of
the Polish frontier. Source could not recall any details of the law, except
that it stated that the border area was divided into three parts: the forbidden

strip, the border strip,and the border zone.

a. Forbidden Strip (Pas Wzbrontony)

This was a strip of land, also referred to as the border control path
(Pas Drogi Graniczne}), hich was completely under the Border Security Troops’
(WojJsko Ochrony Pogrant NOP) administration and control. re were no
markers indicating its lialts. The width varied, depending on the terrain;
it was never narrower thai 10 mand seldom wider than 100 m, however. The
forbidden strip was an evacuated area, but by Special permission the local
population could enter {t for a Limited time to remove firewood and harvest

hay.

The forbidden strip was 6 m wide and was plowed; a telephone, line
ran parallel to it; ani wooden observation towers on it were Spaced 3 to 5 km
apart, depending on teld of vision. To the best of Source's knowledge,
there were no physical obstacles, such as barbed-wire fences, electrified
fences, and trip flares en the Polish frontier, except west of SZCZHCIN.

fA the coastal areas the forbidden strip renained of f Limits to
pedestrian traffic trom 1§ Qeteber to 15 April, and from sunset to sunrise from
15 April to 15 Getober. There were no movement restrictions within the strip

th the daylight hours during the vacation season from 15 April to 15 October. .

The physical security means along the coast were the same as along
the tnland border except, that radar towers were to replace the observation :
towers sometime in 1962.

b. Border Strip (Strefa Nadgraniczna)

Source described the border strip as an area over which the Border
Security Troops exercised operational control. It extended 2 to 6 km from
the border or from the coast and {t was marked with a Sign "Strefa Nadgraniczna!
Ging to reside within the border strip were required to obtain

All persons desi
permission trom their county Citizens’ Militia (MO) office. Upon arrival
in the border strip area, they were required to register for permanent or
temporary residence with the local Registrar's Office (Biuro Meldunkowe). In
the coastal area, ng summer months (15 April to 15 October) tourists and
vacationers were not required to obtain entry permits from their local MO;
they were required to register, however. Transient passenger traffic through

the border strip required no special authorization.

c. Border Zone (Zona Graniezna)

Source defined the border zone as an area over which the Border
Seeurity Troops brigades exercised limited operational control. The zone
extended up to 30 km from the border. ‘The entrance Into the border zone was
not marked and no Special documentation was required to enter or reside in It,

d. Coastal Waters

The coastal waters were divided into two zones: the territorial
waters, extending } nautical miles from the shore at low tide, and waters of
the adjacent strip (Strefa Wod Przyleglyeh), extending Into the sea for an
additional 3 nautical miles. The WOP exercised complete opgrational controi
over the territdrial waters only. It was within the WOP authority to enforce
existing water traffic regulations; to prevent fishing within the limits of
the territorial waters by foreiga fisaing fleets, and to search all craft for
stowaways, proper documentation of the crews, and contraband.

2. Criteria for Selection of WOP Personnel

The WOP enlisted men came from normal conscription channels. Source

did not know the criteria for selection used by the District Military
Office (Wojskowa Komenda Rejoncwa-¥KR), but he thought that to qualify a
conscript had to have only a clean police record and & minimum of 7 years of
education; political reliability and membership in the Conminist Party Kere

not factors.

Conscripts with ll years of educatign (gimazium) were selected for
officer candidate training upon graduation,® and sent-dlrectly to WOP Officers’
School at KETRZYN, or for NCO training, or were assigned to port battalions
or to border traifie control pests.

where they underwent 2 weeks cf zreliminary training and cursory medical
‘xamination, and were organized into training compantes, platoons and squads,

Following the 2-week preliminary training tney were given U4 weexs of baste
infantry training and basic borde> security training.

specialist training prepared the <raftees for duty with pert battalions or
with border control posts. The training lasted from 6 to 12 weeks. Con-

Seripts who were selected for NCO training attended the Brigade NCO School,

which lasted 9 months.

The mandatory training in the outposts was conducted by officers and
noncommissioned officers. Because of the staggered hours of border duty,

the training was conducted twice ca!ly, from 0400 to 1100 hours, and from 1300

to about 1600 hours. Garrison training was rather Inefficient and the schedule

yas not rigidly followed because of the shortage of personnel. The zain stress
in garrison training was placed ox torder guard subjects. The men were taught
the methods used by border violaters, border reyulations, detection and inter-
pretation of tracks left on the plowed Strip, familiarization with dccuments
had permits used in wae border zone and at border crossing points, types of
patrol duties, Searching and conveying of arrested personnel, and use of
Service dogs. All WOP personnel were required to qualify with their individual

weapon twice a year.

Garrison training was suspexded from September through February, during
which time part of the old conseripts were discharged while the new conscripts

were still undergoing basic training.

commander will be Private ANEOLEK. You will perform your duty on the right
flank of the outpost from the big oak tree on the extrem: Limit of the sector to
the first road crossing. Your duty will be to prevent unauthorized violation
of the border within your sector; upon arriving at the designated border”
sector, to patrol its full length and to pause every half hour and observe it
from concealment. Your route march: Dirt road towards the weeds, then along
the northern cdyw of the woods. At the end of the wooded area turn right and
using the path along the plowed strip walk to the big oak troe. Halt all
persons and identify them. In case of suspicion of any one's identity,
notify the outpont by telephone. Your return route: the bituminous road to
the road crosuing with the bus stop. You will be there approxinatuly 0730
hours, at which time the morning bus should arrive. Upon its arrival check
documents of all passengers. Improperly documented persons escort to the

the plowed stetp mark your foot prints with a letter X Inseribed ina circle
Do you understand your orders? Repeat your order." ‘The patrol commnder
was required to repeat only the pertinent parts of the order.

5. Planning of Border Svourtty

‘The outpost commander was responsible for the security of the border
sector charged to his outpost. preoaring his plans for the safeguarding
of nis sector he guided himself by orders and instructions received from higher
headquarters (battalion and brigade); by the analysis of the local situation
by the CI officer and his recommendation; and by the terrain features existing

in the sector.

‘The commanding officer could order normal operations or reinforced
operations (sluzba wzmocniona). The reinforced operations were ordered in the
event of border violation, or an expected border violation; during political
unrest, such as the Hungarjan revolution of 1956 and Poznan events of 19555
during national holidays, 1 May and 22 July; during Christmas, New Year, and
Easter seasons; and during locally organized political conventions, bazaars,
county fairs, and local celebrations In the border strip. The reinforced
operations were ordered under the assumption that during the increased
traffic avar the border the incidents of border violations increased and the
alertness of the border troops decreased. During reinforced operations the
number of posted patrols was increased by 40 percent and the tour of duty
was extended up to 10 hours for enlisted men and career noncommissioned

officers and to 6 hours for officers.

Upon dectding on a plan of securing the border for a given time period
the commanding officer entered a detailed plan action in the outpost opera~
tions logbook (Ksiazxa Operacyjna). In his plan, he decided whether normal
or.reinforced operation would be conducted; designated hy name the varlous
border patrols and their sector of responsibility; organized the area of
responsibility so that they were overlapping and miually supportings

Border viclators apprehended in the outpost area were first interrogated
at the outpost headquarters by the CI officer, then convoyed under armed guard
through channels to the brigade headquarters for final disposition.

In order to test and stimlate the alertness of the Border Security
Troops and the confidential informant net, the chief of the CI Division at
brigade headquarters dispatched a fictitious border violator every 4 to 6
menths. “Upon apprehension of the violator the personnel responsible for the
apprehension weré rewarded as if a real border violator had been apprehended,
and were never informed of the true circumstances. The usual award to WOP

personnel was 14 days of home leave, a radio receiver or money. Confidential

informers were rewarded financially.

B. JOINT MANEUVERS ss

C. AIR AND HOME TERRITORIAL ANTIAIR DEFENSE FORCES (Powletrzna Obrona Przeciw
Lotnieza Obszaru Kra Jowcgo-POPLOK) (See Annex A for Source's schematic concept

of the organization.)

Source could not give a detailed description of this organization, but from
lectures heard at the WOP Officers’ School at KETRZYN® and from briefings
attended during ‘the Joint maneuvers described in paragraph B above, he

described it in the following general terms:

The supreme headquarters for the organization was the headquarters of the
Warsaw Pact Forces, through the Polish Ministry of National Defense. Source
did not know the structure of the Wersaw Pact Forces headquarters and the Ministry
of National Difense. The Minister of National Defense was Lt Gen SPYCHALSKI.
Subordinate to the minister were the ground ferces, the navy and the air force.
POPLOK was a component element of the air force, commanded by Gen BIELECKI.

Subordinate to Gen BIELECKI was the deputy for aviation matters, rank and
