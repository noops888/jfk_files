and experience, soon understood what the agent was driving nt,

and refused on che

SOURCE related

then explained that he was authorised lo orter soires a straghe

deal vich, if solace only cared to consider le realistically, would turn out to

their mutual benefit.

SotRiEs personality, prticularly his

academic education

and hia reputation as a painter together with hia knei loval attitude towards

the state, qualified SOURCe as the idenl partnor in a sunevlat delicate

under-

taking. The personalities of influence, for whom ir. _unisky was authorised

to speak, could not chink of ary one

with quallficatiorg better clan SOURCEs:

SOURCE replied that, of course, he would gladly become a partner to my efforts

Interded to promoto

the arts because they were the only things he really caryd

for. SOURCE had, after Mr. ZACKSKI's Introductory ninarks, quite correctly

guessed what was meant by the "atraight deal" and he; therefore, tried to avoid

the subject.

Mr.

ZAKREWSKI then asked SOURCE frankly how he did with hia

painting. SOURCe could only truthfully renly that his art was definitely not

suited to provide a living for his and his wife.

This was also the reason,

SOURCE emphasised,

that he wanted to leave Poland because he could no longer:

bear to live fron his wife's incone.

his 1o all well known to un" said Mr. LAKHEWSKI, "But do you in all

seriousness

believe chat you vill do better In Mat demany? They have palntera

by the thousands and you, as a newconer to thia crowd, will only be sorry to have

Joined them.

You will have to depend on your wife's income more than with us in

Poland". Mr. ZAKKIEWSKI then continued that the aid which SOURCE vould receive

would enable him to

better devote hioself to his are because financial worries

would be taken from his mind.

"Is not this a straight deal?", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI

aoked, "you help us and we help you, and we know that your help will be worth the

money".

When SOUrCE asked what was meant by "un" and "he" and what kind of

"help' he was expected to offer, r. ZURZEWSAl cautlously replied that, before

being more specific, he would need SOURCE'a agreement to the proposition.

"Please try to understand", Mr. ZAXRIENSKI sald, "I represent, as you have seen,

the government, and it 1s part of the deal that details of your mission will be

made known. to you the moment ve know that you are willing to help."

SOURCE then

refused by emphasizing that, as an artist, he fole in no way competent for the

malssion which doubtlessly will be ausigned to him In Gormany.

His nerves would

not stand. the strain and,

gooner or later, he vould fail, and thus ruin himself.

Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI accepted SOURCE'g refusal without the slightest sign of dis

appointment,

impatience or anger. He Listened to SOURCE's words with a friendly

smile on his face, and commented that such a reaction was only natural and even

reasonable from a man like SOURCE, and it was only further proof of SOURCE's

Inordinate Intelligence and interrity.

He assured SOURCE that there was no

hurry, and important things quite naturally need sume time to be carefully thought

Inviting SOURCE to carefully reconsider the offer, he asked for permission

to approach the matter a second line in a few weeks. On this occasion, SOURCE

should be prepared,

after Mr. ZARZENSKI'g telephone call, to cone

to che hotel

"BRISTOL"' on ULICA PIERSZECO MAJA" (Pirst of May Road), where matters could be

discussed more casily.

SOURCE agreed to this arrangement tecause he was afraid

that, by a flat and uncompromising refusal, he vould jeopardize his exit permit.

The hotel "BRISTOL" was an impressive four-storied building with a tavern

and a night-club; which had been renovated in 1960. It was patronized ly well-to-

do members of the intelligentsia and tourists.

He renembered having heard from

fellow members of his painters" clus that the

secret police had rented a wing in

one of the upper stories of this hotel.

The rooms, nunter unknow, were said to

be furnished as offices and club

OPERATIONS OF THS BORDER SECURITY TROOPS

1. Border Area

The border area kas established by a law passed by the National Council

dated 2l March 1958, which revised the existing law governing the security of

the Polish frontler. Source could not recall any details

of the law, except

that it stated that the border area was divided Into three parts:

the forbidden

strip, the border strip and the border zone.

a. Forbiddan Strip (Pas Wabrontony)

This was a strip of land, also referred to as the border contros path

(Pas Drogi Granioznell, nich was completely under the Border Security Troops

(Wojsko Ochrony Pograzleza-HOP) administration and control.

There were no

markers indicating its limits.

The width varled, depending on the terrain;

It was never narrower can 10 m and seldom wider

than 100 m, however.

The

forbidden strip was an evacuated area, but by special permission the local

population could enter it for a limited time to remove firewood and harvest

nay.

The forbidden strip was 6 m wide and was plowed; a telephone. line

ran parallel to it; and wooden observation towers on it were

apart, depending on die tield of vision.

To the best of Source's knowledge,

there were no physical ecstacles, such as barbed-wire

electrified

fences, and trip flares on the Polish frontier, except nest of stezbin.

The plysical security means alon the coast were wie same as along

the Inland border except

b. Border Strip (Strefa Nadgranicina)

Source described the border strip as an area over which the Border

Security Troops exeruised operational control.

It extended 2 to 6 km from

the border of from the coast and It was narked with a sign "Strefa Nadsraniezna."

All persons desiring to reside within

the border strip were required to obtain

permission from their county Citizens' Militia (MO) office. Upon arrival

in the border strip area, they were required to register for permanent or

temporary residence with the local Registrar's Office (Biuro Meldunkowe). In

the coastal area, during summer months (15

April to 15 October) tourists and

vacationers were not required to obtain entry permits from their local MO;

they were required to register, however.

Transient passenger traffle through

the border strip required no special authorization.

C.

Border Zone (Zong Graniczna)

Source defined the border zone au an area over which the Border

Security Troops brigades exercised limited operational control.

extended up to 30 im trom the border.

The entrance Into the border zone was

not marked and no special documentation was required to enter or reside in it.

d.

Coastal waters

The coastal waters were divided into two zoneg:

the territorial

waters, extending 3 nautical miles fron the shore at low tide, and waters of

the adjacent strip (Strefa Wod Przyleglych), extending Into the sea for an

additional 3 nautical miles.

The WOP exercised complete opprational controi

over the territórial waters only.

It was within the hOP authority to enforce

existing water traffic regulations; to prevent fishing within the limits of

the territorial waters by foreign fisning fleets, and to search all craft, for

stowaways, proper documencation of the crews, and contraband.

2. Criterla for Selection of WOP Personel

The WOP enlisted men came from normal conscription channels. Source

did not know the criteria for seleccion used by the Distriot MilItary

Ortice (Wojskowa Komenda Rejonora-#KR), but he thought that to quality a

conseript had to have only a clean police record and a minimum of T years of

education; political reliability and membership in the Communist Party were

scripts who were selected for Nid training attended the Brigade NCO School,

which lasted 9 monthg.:

wAs

required to repeat only the pertinent parts of the order.

5. Plannine of Border Sicuriti

The outpost commander was responsible for the security of the border

sector charged to his outpost.

In preparing his plans for to safeguarding

of his sector he guided himself by orders and instructions recelved from higher

headquarters

(battalion and brigade); by

the analysis of the local situation

officer and his recommendation; and by the terrain features existing

in the sector.

The commanding officer could order normal operations or reinforced

operations (sluzba izmocniona) •

The reinforced operations were ordered in the

event of border violation, or an expected border violation; during political

unrest, such as the Hungarian revolution of 1956 and Poznan evento of 1956;

during national holidays, 1 May and 22 July; during Christmas, New Year, and

Easter seasons; and during locally organized political conventions, vazaars,

county fairs, and local celebrations in the border strip.

The reinforced

operations were ordered under the assumption that during the increased

traffic near the

border the incidents of border violations increased and the

alertness of the border troops decreased.

During reinforced operations the

number of posted patrols was increased by 40 percent and the tour of duty

was extended up to 10 hours for enlisted men and career noncommissioned

officers and to 6 hours

for officers.

Upon deciding on a plan of securing the border for a given time period

officer entered a detailed plan of action in the outpost opera

tions logbook (Kslazka OperacyJna)..

In his plan, he decided whether normal

or. reinforced operation would

be conducted; designated by name the various

border patrols and

their sector of responsibility; organlzed the area of

responsibility so that they were overlapping and mutually supporting;

that the noxt higher headquarters were notifled about the alert,

6. I'narword and Signs

The challenge (Haslo) and the reply (Qizer) of the password for the

fixed by the brigade headquarters.

The challenge was always a com-

ponent part of a weapon and the reply

has always the name of a city, which

started with the same letter as the challenge soni. The procedure for

challenging and replying was as follows:

Challenger!

"Halt!' Who goes there?" (Stoj! Kto idzie?)

Challenged: "Border Service" (Sluzba Grandesna)

Challenger:

"Challenge?" (Hasio)

Challengod:

"Trigger." (Kurek)

Challensor: "KRAKON; thank you; free passage." (KRAKOW; Dziekuje; Droga Wolna)

There were no other means of mutual identification known to Source,

except murking of the crossing of

the plowed strip described in paragraph ir,

above.

7. Ruporting Procedures of Border Vlolations

Whonever tracks on the plowed strip, or other indications of unauthorized

movement ware observed,

the patrol notified outpost headquarters at once by

telephono and by flares.

The outpost duty officer alerted the entire outpost,

the CI oftleer, the battalion headquarters, and both flanking outposts.

He

dispatched the service dog and the dog handler team to the place of violation,

deployed the alore detail in the expected join of the border violator and

ordered roinforced operations within the sector of responsibillty.

At battalion headquarters the duty officer alerted the brigade head-

quarters, the CI Section and adjacent battalion headquarters; and deployed the

battalion's reserve detail, paying particular attention to securing by road

blocks all road junctions, bus stops,and railroad stations within a rallus of

15 km of the point of border violation.

At brigade level the duty officer alerted the brigade nesdquarters and

deployed the reserve detail in the border zone,

road junctions, bus

stops, and railroad stations within a ¿adius o: 30 km from the point of border

violation.

When it was determined that an Illegal border crosser had left Polish

the outpost auty officer obtaina: trough command channels permission

to pursue the violator into the foreign territory.

B; mutual agreement of the

Communist bloe countries such permissions sere prompily given, and border guards

on both sides of the border mutually cooperated.

similtaneously, the outpost

duty officer notified the local Cl officer, sno, assisted by the service dog

handler team, tracked back the probable route

si escape in order to establish

the point of departure of the border viola:or and to determine whether any

help was rendered to the violator by a local accomplice.

The CI officer also

alerted his "Agentura" In order to deterzine whether any strangers were ob-

served in the area, and to obtain any inforsation on the suspect.

Border violators apprehended in the outpost area were first interrogated

It the outpost heaiquarters by the CI officer, then convoyed under armed guard

through channels to the brigade headquarters for final disposition.

In order to test and stimulate the alertness of the Border Security

Troops and the confidential Informant net, the chief of the CI Division at

brigade headquarters dispatched a fictitious border violator every 4 to 6

eonths.

Upon apprehension

of the violator the personnel responsible for the

apprehension were rewarded as if a real border violator had been apprehended,

and were never informed of the true circumstances.

The usual award to WOP

personnel was 14 days of home leave, a radio receiver or money. Confidential

informers were rewarded financially.

3. JOINT MANEUVERS

In July 195y, while assigned to the SLIWNO PZ Post as CI officer, Source

received orders to report to the Baltic WOP Brigade headquarters at KOSZALIN,
