previously reported, and| regularly works an hour or so of uninterrupted over-
time every working day personally reorganizing procedures, cleaning out, consolidating,

In the four months he has been under my supervision, Subject
has demonstrated that he merits in full measure the high opinion
of him held by his previous supervisor. Conscientious, careful,
fully knowledgeable of Registry procedures he has gone abdut his
day-to-day tasks in an exceptionally proficient way without tho
need for constant supervision. He is prompt in his response to
requests and has an excellent sense of "get the job done". He
is an intelligent and concerned suporvisor who has been meticulous
in keeping his supervisors briefed on personnel and other problems
as they have arisen in the Station Registry. He appears fully
capable of assuming larger responsibilitios in the records field.
The rating officer regrets that Subject's family situation pre-

eludes his staying for another tour. é

With, about nineteen months experience managing the station

rogistry already under his belt, his usefulness here increases.

He continues to demonstrate the same quietly effective leadership

and talent for sound organization in his.own shop as were noted

on the last fitness report.

_ While maintaining a high standard in the more routine day-
to-day services and processes a registry is normally expected to.
supply, hé has also been the catalyst for a thorough, carefully
phased and continuing roview and, where appropriate, purge of .
registry and other file holdings: Administering this ambitious
reduction program requires sound judgment, and experience in
handling the detail in our existing records. Subject has these
qualities and has achieved impressive results. To complete
this task, he has asked to extend his tour here for one year
until ‘November 1971 and Headquarters has approved this-

He is invariably completely responsive to guidance.from the
DCOS,. his immediate supervisor, and conscientiously seeks to
achiove the work goals which are identified during our occa~
sional accomplishment and porformance consultations. The
spirit of cooperation with which ho deals with other station

personnel: is equally commendable.
No criticism can be made of his security and cover deportment.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS:

As the Chief of the’ Registry | this employee has performed well. -

He has abundant energy and constantly comes up with ideas for the tmprovement
of the efficiency of his unit. He welcomes hard work and is able to fill in and
take over any job in his unit and keep up with his own duties as well, Asa -
aupervisor, he has a slight tendency to be arbitrary when convinced he is right.
This may be due to the fact that the Registry frequently operates under conditions
of pressure due to the recent reorganization, reduction, and relocation of the
Station, The Station has been required to get the job done with fewer people and

under more difficult working conditions.

~ Recommendation for Promotion

SUBJECT;

1, Subject has been in grade GS-10 since Juno 1968,
Based on his outstanding performance as Chief of Registry in
Station since June 30, 1971, he strongly merits
to grado GS-11 at this time, When Subject took
over tho responsibility for Registry a year ago, he found a
system glutted with paper and bound up by a policy which
discouraged getting rid of dt, He Lound many procedures in
foreo which were out of date, if not obsoicte, and proposed
stYeamlined procedures, which were adopted, to replace thom,
He asked for and. was given tho responsibility to analyze and
distribute the cables, which had previously been a function
of the Chicf of Station's secretary, He recommended. the
discontinuance of the abstract system, which proposal had
been adopted by most clements of the Station, He recommended
a reduction in tho retention period for cable and dispatch
chronos, With tho help of a TDY team here for the first half
of CY 1972, he devised and instituted a prograni of purging
the files, This program has resulted in tho disposition of
moxt of the departed Soviet files, a seve. trimming of the
truc flies, and the review, reduction and up-dating of
ae project and operational ftles All of this work ¥

ootme 6, ies op the

tinent doety s for trans
He: . In summary, Subject performed a thorough "house-
cleaning" of Station records in the full meaning of that ‘phrase,
This program is by no means finished, In fact, Subject has
plans for continuing efforts along these lines which may exceed
,his tenure at this Station since he intends to return to Head~
quarters not Jater than May 1974, The on-godng program includes
a review and reorganization of the subject files, the encrypted
201's and the disposition (hopefully) of «bout 50 feet of wicro~
film. A corollary to these projects will be a significant
eduction Jn the index cards, which at present lead to the mie:
Yili lind to other superfluous waterial we either have or will |

destroy.

2. ‘The equally important aspect of records management,

namely the introduction of procedures to lessen the likelihood



nad

4f not prevent tho reoccurrence of this pile-up of paper
is not lost on this officer. He constantly thinks in terms
of procedures and controls to accomplish this end.

2 3, Subject is dedicated, highly motivated, con-
scientious, and hard working, He reports to work oach day
ap hour hefore the Station opens in order to distribute the
cables by opening of business, He never hesitates to respond
positively to any request for help. Indeed, he solicits
work which he believes can be done more easily or more simply
in his unit, In all respects, Subject is a trained, profes-
stonal records managoment officer who is thoughtful as well
as enthusiastic about his work,

: 4, It is strongly recommended that Subject be pro-
moted to grade GS-11,
