This employee continues to be. Chief of the Station Registry®

During the past year

his level of performance can be properly evaluated as exceptionhy prolicient. He

contimes to welcome hard work, is not bothered by constantly changing deadines

and is able to fill in for any absent member of his unit, and keep up his own work

as well. He is quite conscious of the value of Government personnel and materiel,

and does everything in his power to conserve these resources. He contines to come

up with new ideas on how to perform his functions in a more efficient and effective

manner. This results in benefits to the entire Station. It la regretable that the

posttion this employee fills does not allow for promotion since he has been performing

at a level above his present grade for several years.

Basod on his outstanding performance as Chlof of Rogistry in

sinco June 30, 1971, he strongly merits

• to grado Gs-11 at this tine.

When Subjoct took

over the rosponsibility for registry a year ago, he found a

system glutted with papor and bound up by i poldry which

discouraged sotting rid of 1t.

Ho lound many procedures in

force which were out of dato,

streamilned procodures, which were adopted, to replace them.

Ho asked for and was given the responsibility to analyzo and

distribute the cables,

which had previously boon a function

of the Chief of Station's secrotary.

He recommended the

discontinuance of the abstract system,

which proposal had

been

adopted by most clements of the Station.

Ile recommended

a reduction in the retentlon poriod for cable and uispatch

With tho help of & TDY tean here for the first half
