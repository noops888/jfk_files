actions."' (00107)
The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for inside Cuba

have been assessed in depth. Fifteen’ locations have been selected as suitable centers for

OCCURRENCE? Th a Presidential meeting on Vietnam with the CIA participants
being MeCone and Colby the record by Colby reflects that McNamarra pointed out that
Lodge has little contact with Diem and has not been out of Saigon. Mr. McCone commented
that he believed that we should move cautiusly, that we should talk seriously to Diem

__...and_that Lodge should be urged to visit the countryside to obtain a more realistic

view of the effects of suspending aid. Mr. McCone also suggested that another approach
be made toNhutto seek his cooperation ina departure. The President asked whether we
had carefully studied the detail effects of cuts in aid.(as proposed in a paper prepared
by Hillsman). It was evident that the effects had not been studies. The President
asked DOD and CIA to analyze the Hillsman paper. He also asked that a telegram be sent
to Lodge asking him to try to reduce the press leakage from Saigon and to establish some
real contact with Diem. Any current plans for aid negotiation should be stalled, and the

not be involved in such a-policy-making function, although he would-be in a position-to

provide technical advise to HARKINS and TRUEHART as well as carry out their instructions
in the operations field. The President stated that if the forces in Saigon were not
clearly in favor of the coup we should discourage its launching. The Attorney General
felt the U.S. was risking too much based on flimsy ev idence. The DCI stated his view
that even a successful coup would create a period of interregmum, confusion which might
only be solved by a second or third coup.
