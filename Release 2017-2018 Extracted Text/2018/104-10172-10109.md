the Mexican Government to deport subject (an American Communist so, for a time aftc

his departure had power of attorney for Alfrod Ki Stern) fron l'exico. This effort

has been mounted through LIKIYiK-2.

In mid September LIKAMK-2 reported that he had succeeded in getting this

matter to the attention of the President of Mexico through one of the President's

personal advisors named Jose Lorenzo CissIu.

Through this channel the President

was generally informed on lialgerin's Comunist affiliations and his correction with

Peconmendations were also made

that Stern's money (which he

had left in lexico) be frözen if possible and that lalperin be decorted.

In the three months following these developments, repeated requests for

news on the matter were made to LIKirik?, who stuted each time that he nad done all

he could when he brought the matter to the President's attention and that he could

not force the point further.

He dia, however, mention it fron tize to tire to both.

He statei he had heart this from Jose I. SANTILlAi, Director of

He then gave

the following explaration for the delays so far encountered in the case:

It 19, theretore, almost

inpossible to açoly Article 33 or the Constitution against hir. Article

33, which gives tre President yores to depori any undesirable foreigner,

I5, in effect, aplied very imirajuently One of the reasors is that

the case must be very clear that to foreigner has operates against

l'exican Interests. Another is tat the case must be very streng since

the intended victin ray appeal to the counts. d third reaso, particularly

applicable in tris case, is that to Government does not bis: to take

strong action in, this case, wiich it regaras as political rativer than

criminal. The overament is respecting the Mexican principle o granting

political asylun, ani at the sace aime does not wish to put hirself into

a position whers it can become the target of attacks fron'lerist elements in

the country.

Ise government is rurther in a bal position in tis case

because Halperin worked for a Goierment department (Nacimal Financiera)

and the Governmert or

various intiviiuals in it do not wish to be placed. in the

position of having to admit they iale a bad selection.

In the case of Francesca Scalia, Jewel swindler and

Immoral character, the Nexican Goverment tried to deport her

for may nonths but was successful only after soveral injunctions

c.

On the other hand, LIMYAK-? states that the Government has a

recourde which is not as blunt as Article 33 but is usually suificient to

result in a person's leaving Mexico. This consists of communicating to

the subject the Mexican Goveminent's dissatisfactinn with having him in

the country and inviting lim to leave it in a certain period.

The period

can vary from a couple of weeks to several months.

This, Incidentally,

was the means used to obtain the departure of the Nicaraguan Commurist

Marlo SOst Navarro early in 1957, In a teet operation mounted by the

In Mexico the legal forms

are observed and the the US. Government, which also

in scrupulous in its observance of such forms, should be able to understand the
