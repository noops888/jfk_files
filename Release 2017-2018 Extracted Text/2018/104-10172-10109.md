1, Since the last week in Ausust 15 eeremwlnts been trying to induce
«the Mexican Governnent to deport subject (ax mericaT ist who, for a time after

his departure had power of attorney for Alirod Ks Stern) fron “exieo. This effort
hag been mounted through LIKAYAK.

26

2. “In mid Septembér LIKAYAK-2 reported that he had sveceeded in setting this
matter to the attention cf the President of Mexico through one of the President's
personal advisors named Jose Lorenzo C.SsIi'. Through this channel the Fresident
was cenerally inforned on Nalperin's Communist affiliations and his, cornection with
Stern, Reconnendations were also made that Stern's money (which he
had left in Mexico) be frozen if possible and that Halperin be decorted,

3. In the three months following these developments, repeated requests’ for
news on the matter were made tc LIKIYAK=2, who stcted each tine that-he had done all
he could when he brought the matter to the President's attention and thet he could
not force the point furtner, He did, however, mention it fron tine to tire to octh
Fernando RCKAN Lugo, Undersecretary of Interiar, and to COSSIO,

«ke Although LIKAYtK-2 was not able te rezort any concrete developrents in the
three months period, LIFE\T coverage on Kalperin and ILCNAY?OuL target's residence

shoved that this staticn's message had zotten.consideration fron higaly placed ;
persons in the Mexican Governnent. : :

8, At the end of Ausust and degincing of September, Halzerin was i
freely expressing confidence that. his Mexican inrigrant.vapers would be 1
preeessed throug in quick time and he anticirated no trouole becatisé of }
his associaticn wits Stern. Towaris the end of Seotemver, Lovever, and sacra
thereafter, Halcerin's confidence declined as his papers were continually :

> held uss Even his lawyer (Carmen Of2i0 y Gama), a oerson having excellent
contacts in the Government, seemed unable to conclude. tae gases

b. On.23 September Ruth HIRSGHFISLY and Ralph Scott, employees of
AYFOuL coverage stated that Nalperin wes vorried to.

% se funds, at least tenporarily, but that

the Mexican bazks involved insisted they were bound by international banking
laws arid coli not do this. A transfer cf $655,000 (U. S.) was mede; but
the Swiss bark refsed to accert it, retumed it to CO.

5. On 2 Decender 1957 LINAYik~2 passed $ List of ten or so
| manes of Antricans iz Nexico, with the roquest Oa the Stabis information
| as to whether they were conmunists, At that tine ETKAYAK=2
, that since the Halzerin natter had hung fire fcr §0-Tong “He UnoWET Is Fossible
\ ve S. Government would prefer nat to pass on such information. LIKAYAX=2 seemed

| quite confident that in would be eventually deported but stated he would
again look into the ratter.

6 On 13 DecexSer LIXAYAK-2 reportad that erin would a *invited" to leave
: the country. He ststei he had heard this from Jose T, SAXTILL ctor of

t Inszections at the Imigration Section of the Hinistry of Interisr. He then gave
the following axplanstion for the delays so far encountered in the cases

: a. So far as the Mexican Governnent knows, HALS=RIN has nét, while
in Nexico, done anything haraful to Mexico. It is, thereZore, alnost

inpossible to acaly Article 33 of the Constitution against hin. Article

| | 33, which gives ‘the President pover to deport any undesirzble foreisner,

is, in effect, aslied very infrequently. Che of the reasons is that :
the case must de very clear thst. tho foreipner has operates ssiinst
Mexican interests.” Ancther is that the case must be very streaz since

the intended victin ray appeal to the courts, A third reas ticularly
apelicable in this case, is that the Governnent does not visi to take
ng action in,this case, which it regards as political rather than

eriminal, The zoverament is resoectint the Nexican principle of. granting 3
Political asylun, ani at the sare time docs act wish to rut Aimelf into ‘

& position where it can become the tarcet of attacks fron'leftist elements in

the country, The governient is further in a bad position in this case .
because Halperin werked for a Government department (Nacicaal Financicra) : te
ani the Governze:t or various iniiviiuals in it do not wish to be © pleced in the

position of having to ainit they xa‘le a bad selection,

b. Underlining the difficulties of applying Article 33), LEMIAX
cited two (2)"exanpies irom personal knowledges

1, An Smeriean sadist is still in }

2. In the case of Francesca Scacta, jewel swindler and
immoral character, the Mexican Government tried to deport her
for many months but was suecessful only after soveral injunctions
had been issued and expired,

&. On the other hand, LIKAYAK~2 states ‘that the Government has a
Tecourde wiich is not as blunt as Article 33 but is usally sufficient to
result in @ person's leaving Mexico, This consists of communicating to
the subject the Mexican Government's dissatisfaction with having him in
the country and inviting him to leave it in a certain pericd, The period

- Gan vary frm a couple of: weeks to several months. This, incidentally,
was the means used te obtain the departure of the Nicaracuan Conmunist
‘Mario SOSA Navarre early tn 1957, in a tect operation mounted by the
station through LIKAYAK-2, : :

, . Ge  LIKAYAK=2 states he is thoroughly convinced that his Government
intends to "invite" Halperin to leave country. ife points out;

“however, that Halperin could probably get one or nore injunctions
against this measure,

7. LIKAYAK~2 apveared to take the matter very personally but pointed out that
in Mexico tie legal forms are observed and the the US. Government, which also

in scrupulous in.its observance of such forms; should be able to understand the.
situation,
