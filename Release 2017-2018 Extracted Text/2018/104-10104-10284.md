MEMORANDUM FOR: C/E/BG/C

SUBJECT : Role of Vancouver, Canada, in
Dieinformatios re the Garrison
Investigation .
es ai Sat :
REFERENCE :(OCOWL 6315, 22 August 1967,

subject: KEYWAY/Garrison Investigation
of Kennedy Assassination: Donald P.
NORTON, file 100-300-17,

Ly metgrence forwarded a CI/R&A memorandum about NORTON
tol Chiat Gi station, Ottowa] Since that date FBI reports have shown that
NORTON is a con man, and U.S. Air Force Medical records have re-
vealed that he was discharged in July 1950 as a result of psychiatric
problems, having tried on two oy more occasions to commit suicide.
NORTON's lies about CIA first appeared in the Vancouver Sun on 5
Auguet 1967.

‘The attached FBI report, DBB 77295, 10 April 1967, ¢ancerns
‘another ¢xample of disinformation appearing in Vancouver, involving the
San, and related to the Garrison case. A check of Agency files showed
that we have no record of Trevor LAUTENS, Mario GRACIAS, or @
Miss Dorothy WHITTY. The reference of the unidentified caller to
GRAGIAS may have been a garble for Manuel GARCIA Gonzales, whom
Garrison hag named as one of the assassins #f President Kennedy but
who appears to have disappeared or to be non-existent. There are no
Ay y traces (includ! MWAVE)

ianiet iy and don ifieally:
have given Garrison's atory enthusiastic coverage and support, because
it is ‘obviously in their interest te rokintain that President Kennedy was



_ “seonet

assassinated not by pro-Communist Lee Harvey Oswald but rather ae
& reouit of a right-wing conspiracy involving CIA.

4. The surfacing of two such allegations in or through the Vancouver
$an seems to place a strain on coincidence. Do you have any information
about the use of the Sun in other surfacings of} RDER propagaada
against CIA? Is there any information about contacts between employees-of

the Station, Although Headquarters has no record of Trevor LAUTENS,
it is conceivable that Station files may also hold information about him.
