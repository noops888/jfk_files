NORTON, flle 100-300-17.

• 1(erence lorwarded a auntA memerandum about NORTON

to Chief of States, Ottows.

Since that date FBI reports have abown that

NORTON is a con mas, and U.S. Al. Force Medical records have re-

vealed that he uns discharged in July 1950 as a result of paychiatrte

problems, having tried on two or more occasiona to commit suicide.

NORTON's lies about CIA first appeared In the Vancouver Sun on 5

Auguet 1967.

The attached FBI report, DBB 17295, 10 April 1967, concerns

another example of disinformation appearing in Vancouver, involving the

Sus, and related to the Garrinen case. A check of Agoney files showed

that we hive no record of TreVOr LAUTENS, MArIO GRACIAS, OI @

Mins Dorolay WHITTY. The reference of the unidentified caller to

ORACAS may have been a garble for Manuel GARCIA Gonzalen, whom

Garsison has named as one of the assaumins of President Kennedy but

who appear to have disappeared or to be non-exietent. There are no

Agency fascen (lacluding IMWAVE) on CARCIA.

a result of a right-wing conspiracy involving CIA.

4.

The aurfacing of two such allegations in or through the Vancouver

sua seema to place a atrala on coincidence. De you have any informantlos

about the une of the Sun in other urineinga of MHORDER propagand

against CIA? ls there any Information about contacts between employees of

the Sun and representatives of Seviet intelligence? If no such information

lo at hand, It would be appreciated ll these questions were forwarded to

the Station. Although Headquarters has no record of Trever LAUIENS,

It lo conceivable that Station flles may alno hold informntion about him.
