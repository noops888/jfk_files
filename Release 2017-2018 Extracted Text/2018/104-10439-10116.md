3. Preliminary Analysis: As pointed out in a preliminary
analysis ©: ie A c 2x, made in March 1985 when _I was
proparing for travel to fin connection vith the (GdHOPS-1
case! ".,.There is no convinéing evidence that the group is
working either for or against the regixe of Fidel CASTRO.
Reperts on their contacts with us and their discussions among
themselves are at variance. In 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly
knowing that they were plotting against him, talked to AMLASH..2
and seven members of his group to enlist their support against
Anibal ESCALANTE Dellunde and the communists in ba. Possibly
they are playing both ends against the middle. ‘ney certainly
have been and are in contact with the two ends." ‘The following
comments are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AMLASH conspiracy —- As detailed by’ b3716
{IN 28634) on 6 April 1965, QUSPORT-1 reporting on a meeting
of the AMLASH group, including AMWHIP-1 mentioned the following
significant points:

(1) KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around tor
years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

13-00000 |,

‘problem is a more serious and basic one. As indicated in

"the ABLASH circle is wide and each new friend of whom we learn
seems to have knowledge of the plan." I believe that the

paragraph 3 of the present memorandum, Fidel CASTRO hinself
reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the group was plotting
against him and, knowing it, enlisted its support. Hence we
cannot rule out the possibility of provocation. Assassination,
obviously, is a dangerous game, not merely to the plotters in

@ physical sense, but to a sponsoring government which may
suffer severe political repercussions at home and abroad iz its
involvement is made known. In the instant case, the risks of
exposure of the ODYOKS hand would appear high, whether there is
@ provocation or not. Considering the individuals who are
involved directly, their contacts with KUBARK officers,and their
reported plan to expa 0 " i n the plan could

be highly embarrass even more the case
now that ESPINOSA

given adequate support

B. The contacts at{ _—_—Pahite matters affecting
the Station.- The "recruitment" of Zaureen had been the
subject Of an exchange of cables between| and Eeadquarters |
and of discussions at Headquarters between #H/C and WE (See

1071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955). The annoying thing in i
this connection now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to
ODENVY and CDURGE and the danger that, if he is indiscreet,
his story about this (and the other matters) could reach some
curious newspaperman, (In this connection, it appears that the
questionable decision to put Maureen in touch with the AMLASH
group vas made without the knowledge of STOCKYCOD.) | SSPINOSA
did not report any criticism of the KUBARKers at but it
is evident that the AMLASH group knows more aboat them than
we might wish. What is new and of concern from CSPINOSA about
matters in| is his story of AMWAIP 1 and \UNBNAFU-19
dealings. The questions raised about AM¥HIP-1 are of mutual
concern also to Headquarters which has been running him and

which he ha: ted often. (On the occasion of ny

rous trip —_/ the(@uloPs-2 case, GROWERY had voiced
his doubts aboutothe whole group and specifically about ANVHIP-1
and his connection with(UNSNAFU-19.) At issue are two basic
points, the knowledges on the part of [UNSNAFU-19 about KUBARK's
connection with AMHIP-1 and the chargé that AMWHIP-1 bas been
Cefrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction. Also to be kept
in mind is the fact that ODENVY has an office in which
well might have been informed of the allegations and which might
have been asked for comments - although ODENVY policy always
has been to stay away from any investigation of other government
agencies unless specifically directed by the Attorney General

to investigate. REPROME TION .

been involved indirectly because of reporting by its sources
