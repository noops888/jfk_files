Preliminary

Analysis: As pointed out in a preliminary

praparing for travel tol

case:

...There is no convincing evidence that the group is

working either for or against the regise of Fidel CASTRO.

Reports

on their contacts

with us and their discussions abong

themselves are at variance.

In 1962 Fidel CASTRO, reportedly

knowing that they were plotting against him, talked to AMLASH.-)

and seven minbers of his group to enliat their support againet

Anibal ESCALANTI Dellunde and the conmunista in Cuba.

Possibly

they are playing both ends against the middle.

They certainly

been and are in contact with the two ends."

Tbe Lolloving

comments are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AMLASH conspliacy - As detailed by 43716

(IN 28634) on 6 April 1965, QUSPORT-I reporting

on a meeting

of the AMLASH group, including ANNHIP-I mentioned the following

significant points:

years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

"the AMLASH circle is wide and each new friend of whom we learn

seens to have knowledge of the plan."

I believe that the

problem is a nore serious and basic

cannot rule out

the possibility of provocation.

Assassination,

obviously, ls a dangerous game, not merely to the plotters in

• physical sense, but to a sponsoring government which nay

suffer severe political repercussions at home and abroad it its

involvement is made known.

In the instant case, the risks of

exposure of the ODYOKS hand would appear high, whether there is

a provocation or not.

Considering the individuals who are

Involved directly, their contacts with KUBARK officers, and their

reported plan to exposer it

Do that ESPINOSA has talked to onE lAUd ODURGa, although

even more the case

fortunately the tenor of his complaint was that KUBARK had not

given adequate support

and the natters affecting

AStation. - The "recruitment" of Maureen had been the

subject of an exchange of cables between|

vand Headquarters

and or discussions at Headquarters between +H/C and WE (See

-1071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955).

The annoying thing in

this connection now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to

ODENVy and CDURGE and the danger that, if he is indiscreet,

his story about this (and the other matters)

could reach some

curious newspaperman.

(In this connection, it appears that the

questionable decision to put laureen in touch with the AMLASH

group was made without the knowledge of STOCKYCOD.) ESPINOSA

did not report any criticism of the KUBARkers at‹

but it

is evident that the AMIASH grOup knows more about them than

ve might wish. What is new and of concern from ESPINOSA about

_is his story of AUtHIP 1 and UNSNAFU-19

The questions raised about AMHHIP-I are of mutual

concern also to Headquarters which has been running him and

(On the occasion of my

PoInts, the knowledge on the part of UNSNAFU-19 about KUBARK'=

onnection with AMNHIP-l and the charge that AWHIP-I has beei

defrauding KUBARK in the jewelry transaction.

Also to be kept

in mind is the fact that ODENVY has an offico inl

which

well might have been informed of the allegations and which might

have been asked for coments - although ODINVY policy always

bas been to stay away from any investigation of other government

agencies unless specifically directed by the Attorney General

to investigate.
