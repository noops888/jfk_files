and all members of the public are asked to excuse themselves

from the room.

MI. Blakey. Let me see if I can present the problem

to

you as succinctly as I can, although perhaps I should begin

with an apology to the committee for bringing about a meeting

of the full committee on such short notice.

Obviously, there has been a recess and some of the

membership has been gone for the last week and this is really!

the first opportunity that we have had.

The problem has come up during the

recess

in our efforts

to work with the Central Intelligence Agency in preparing

hearings. The problem really goes as follows: In the central

case study is the Mexico City issue. The Agency has given us

complete access to everything in this area and this includes

the nature of the surveillance that the Agency had of the

Russian and Cuban Embassies.

They had photographic and electronic surveillance of both

places. This covered the crucial periods of time, more or

less, and that is a big question, more or less.

And I now

have to say that the person alleged to have been Oswald went

in the embassy.

/ Nevertheless, the Agency never came up with a photograph

of Oswald coming in and out of the Agency. Indeed they sent

back up to washington

the wrong photograph. This has given

rise to the whole problem of the mysterious plan.

The significance of the issue of the investigation

literally speaks for itself. If Oswald did not go in and

apply for that visa, and someone else dia, then it is obvious

that Oswald had

an associate. If he had an associate, the

single assassin theory.

is in real serious trouble.

What we need to do is to pursue in our hearings for your

benefit our ability to understand what went on down in Mexico.

We

have witnesses, scheduled for the hearings and we now asked

the Central Intelligence Agency to make available to us those

materials dealing with the surveillance, which are Hill-sensi

tive and they go right to the heart of sensitive sources and

methods. But the Agency prefers not to disclose them.

Now, they have no objection to the staff looking at them

and they frankly have no objection to this committee looking

at them and they have no objection to us, at least in dealing

with Agency employees, using or pursuing these matters in the

hearings, but then they say to us the following: "But what ad

you do about kule 11?"

# Rule 11 of the House says that all committee äocuments

are property of the House and as such all members of the House

have access to them. We say, well, our response to them

is a$

follows:

"What do you want me to do about the rules of the

House of Representatives?

I cannot change them."

And their response is: "Well, why don't you adopt,

meaning the committee adopt, a rule that looks like the House

Intelligence Committee's rule on member access?"

So, we looked at that very carefully and the rule of the

House Intelligence Committee provides roughly as follows:

Members can have access to documents in the posession of the

•House Intelligence Committee under terms and conditions set

forth by the House Intelligence Committee up to and

including

denial

of access. Thats,

we can set out the exact language

for you but the House Intelligence Committee's rule explicitly

authorizes the House Intelligence Committee to deny access

to

member.

And I said, or our response to the Agency is as follows:

"You cannot seriously expect me to suggest to my committee the

adoption of a rule that is on its face inconsistent with gule

11, can you?"

And they

said, "yes, we know that it is inconsistent but

if you give us at least as much protection as the House

turning it over to you."

4) My response is that "I cannot do that."

I cannot suggest to this committee that you adopt a

rule

that is on its face inconsistent with Rule 1l. The House

Rule, after all mI am talking as a lawyer, your lawyer I

guessathe rules of the House are explicit. The rules of this

committee are explicit. The resolution of this committee

explicitly says that your rules must be consistent with the

rules of the House.

So, I cannot suggest to you a rule like that rule of the

House Intelligence Committee.

I played around with language with Jim wolfe and we came

up with the following suggestion that may meet the needs of

the Central Intelligence Agency. The rule does not deny

access to any member but it conditions that access to the

time, place and manner by the following procedure: that

member would have to request access in writing and the request

would be taken up by the full committee and, if the full

committee voted to give the member access, he would get it

then and there and, if the committee decided that under the

circumstances the committee member or the members should

not

have access, it would cause the question to be taken back up

on

the House floor.

Of course,

if the House floor in effect reaffirms Rule li

in this case, then our rules would permit the member to have

access. If the House floor says that the members should not

nave access, then of course it would be the resolution of the

"floor that would deny the member access and not our own rules.

fBasically, what it would do is that it would cause the

House of Representatives to take a second

look at the scope

and impact of Rule 11, not as an abstract question of

principle, but as a concrete instance where if what the

member

wanted access to was something that could be fairly described

as the "family jewels," then it would be the burden of the

full committee to say that it is too risky to turn over this

material to this member.

It would then provide a mechanism for transferring that

decision to the full House floor and the full House f100r

would then be in a posture of debating the issue in the

concrete context, that

is, the specific request of a specific

member to see a specific document, and you could bring to the

attention of the House the nature of that document without

actually revealing it.

If, of course, the House votes to reaffirm pule 11 in

this instance, access would be granted. It is my judgment

that the Agency would buy this rule

as giving them the maximum

protection of the disclosure, or the routine and automatic

disclosure of the more sensitive methods, to 435 people simply

llon reguest.

The choices are hard. If we do not adopt it, I think the

Agency simply will not permit us to explore sensitive sources

and methods like the

Mexico issue in our hearings and the only

way we will get the information out of the Agency is by a very

sensitive declassification process in the Agency first. We

need to have the information over here to work with it.

# If we bring it over here to work with it and cannot give

them some protection in the context of pule l1, they will not

give it to us. That is the dilemma you are in.

I am prepared to discuss with you the exact language of

Rule '11 and the exact language of the Intelligence Committee'$

would it be feasible to enter into an

agreement with the Agency that gave them the right to recall

when

at any time, they want the documents covered by the agrement,

so if they were advised that there was now a request to revier

them, we would get a binding agreement and give it back to

them?

we tried that, Mr. Sawyer.

Mr. Sawyer. I just threw it out.

Mr. Fithian. well, then, Eob, what you are saying is

that if we get a document that shows some very, very sensitive

aspects of surveillance and we make that a part of our record.

when we get ready to fold up shop, in our records is this

document where we require

the maximum security, and the

inability then of the Assassination Committee to make

available to the public our record falls 'seriously into

question first.

Mr. Blakey. I think that is true. There are certain

things, and in other words when we are dealing with what

happened in the assassination, everything cannot be made

public. If we begin dealing with the way in which certain

things were learned, I think we have to recognize that that

probably, unless we can convince the Executive Department to

in effect declassify it, it

will not come out.

Mr. Fithian. It will not what?

Mr. Blakey. It will not be made public.

Mr. Fithian. What physically happens to it then?

will be in effect classified in our records and our records

would be the House Intelligence Committee.

If For example, the Agency had a surveillance on the Russian

Embassy, that is a wire tap, and the physical surveilance, a

photographing surveillance, a sensitive surveillance to the

highest degree,

andit poses potential problems for the

existing Mexican Government.

Mr.

Fithian. I am in full support of the proposition

and

I want to see, once you go back to cornell and we go back to

our committees, what actually happens to that?

Mr. Blakey. Those documents will go to the Intelligence

Committee who will look them

up like

the other documents that

they have. The other answer is, to the degree that a

seen an

question comes up, who was the person who applied for the visa

application in Mexico City, and can we believe what the Agency

tells us, which calls immediately into question the

nature of

their surveillance, the wire taps and the photographs and as

we can talk in a minute about what came out in Cuba.

The Cuban Government has provided to us as a witness the

man who filled out the visa application.

Mr. Devine. Those are free from the Freedom of

Information Act, and they are in the custody of the

Intelligence Committee?

Mr. Blakey.

Because it is in the possession of Congress

which is exempted from that. The witness given to us

in

Mexico, who was in Mexico at the time, says that his memory i$

that the person who filled out the application was not the

same person who Jack Ruby shot in Dallas.

4 Now, there is a lot of corroboration that we have to do

and verification of that, and he gave it as his best memory

and "I am not saying this is what happened, but it is my

memory of what happened; the person who dealt with me is not

the person that I remember," and the ages were different and

the weights were different and the heights were different and

the

facial shape was different.

If there were two people in Mexico City, one of which

was

Oswald and one which was not, there were two people for a

conspiracy.

whatever else we have seriously undermined, if we believe

that testimony we have

undermined the single assassin theory.

So, it is right at the heart of what we have to do now, to get

access and be able to use the photographs the Agency took of

the people who walked in and out of the building.

For us to get it, they have to either declassify it or

they have to give it to us in such a way that they are

reasonably assured that some exercise of discretion will be

made before every member of the House gets immediate access

to

it.

understanding that CIA is willing to risk a fioor procedure?

MI.

Blakey• Yes.

MI.

Fauntroy.

My second question, therefore, is: How do

you distinguish the House Intelligence Committee and its rules

from

that of our select fommittee?

Mr. Blakey. Well, I think the House Intelligence

committee rule is in opposition to pule 11. They have adopted

a rule in contradiction to the pules of the House. As a

that

lawyer, I say

tat and I cannot suggest to you that you adopt

their rule. Their rule explicitly says that the House

Intelligence Committee can deny you access to a document in

their possession.

Rule 11 of the House says that

if it is in possession,

they can condition your access, time place and manner but this

cannot deny it.

MI. Fauntroy. My only concern, Mr. Chairman, therefore

is that we get access. Now, if we can get access through this

means, that is fine. but if we cannot, if the House

Intelligence Committee can do it, for the sake of our mandate,

I have

no objection to adopting their rule.

Mr. Sawyer. That is the way I feel about it, too.

Chairman Stokes. Do we have a copy of the House

Intelligence Committee

Rule?

Mr. Fithian. May I come in here? I am not the careful

stickler on this, MI. Blakey, but it would seem to me that we

Mr.

Blakey. Of course, then you go and read that and you

to Rule 11 and Rule 11 controls the detail.

Mr. Dodd. Could I ask one question there? I am

concerned about really one aspect of this. I would like to

see

us do whatever can be done to gain access immediately to

this information. My real concern comes here, that

all of us

here have made a pledge that at the conclusion of these

hearings next year, that

we would make public all and any

information that helped us arrive at the results we have..

that information would be available to the public.

I am torn, myself, over the desire to get at this, and

And

then faced with the dilemma of having to renege on a

commitment that we felt was important. I do not think we

anticipated this kind of a thing facing us, and that is my

principal concern at that particular juncture.

Mr. Blakey:

The issue arises like this. The process

that we have been going through is a two-step process.

First

it is access and second it is disclosure. When it comes time

to

write the final report, suppose we wanted to tell the

American people about Oswald in Mexico, and the only way to do

it is to tell them about the photographs and the wire taps.

We have been right up front with the Agency and to say Toy

guys may have to bite the bullet when we get down to the end,

the nature of the surveillance goes to

the heart of the

information and we cannot make a

conclusion without indicating

the heart of the information, and

at

that time we will make

the appropriate request of you for not access but disclosure."

MAnd the Agency says, "Well, we recognize that problem and!

we will see if we cannot develop words that let us disclose

enough in the final report to protect our sensitive sources

and methods. "

Mr. podd. What you are telling me is that we are not

being asked at this juncture to make a commitment as to what

ultimately

we will do with the information at the time we make

the final report.

Mr. Blakey. • Yes; the agreement reserves all

Constitutional rights to both sides at the final stage. With

the Agency, that is disclosure. The only question now is

access.

If we need

it to tell the American people, I think we

fight for disclosure.

Chairman Stokes. Having read the Intelligence

Committee's provision, you are lucky if CIA is willing to take

this provision here that you have drafted, because this is not

as stringent as the one of the Intelligence

Blakey. The Intelligence Committee actually says, and

I am

reading now from subparagraph 2, when it says, "Such

action as the committee may take including but not limited

to

approving the reguest in

whole or in part or denying the

reguest."

How can the House Intelligence Committee deny the request

when you have Rule 11 which is explicit and it says and I

quote now from Rule 11, "All members of the House shall have

access thereto." It is explicit.

Our resolution says our rules have

to be consistent with

the rules of the House and the rules of the louse do not leave

any: if's and's or but's. But the requested rule is that it

brings into operation the floor of the House prior to the

members access and thus they will take their chances on the

floor of the House denying a mender access, if we think it :

is

worth fighting over.

Mr: Fauntroy. And your fear is that were we

to operate

under this rule that we would run the risk of being overruled

by the House and

there we would have to give it.

MI. Blakey. But the Agency says they are willing to risk!

a Floor confrontation over an individual access and if they

lose that, they lose. But they are unwilling to run the risk

of having the decision automatically flow from the rule of the

House itself.

REPORTERS

Mr.

Preyer. You do not want to release it because the

man's conscience tells him that this should be made available

to the public. I think at least they have a crack at that

public opinion

mob elicited by them.

Mr. Blakey. And I would say in a routine matter that thei

rule ought to be absolutely construed in favor of a

member's

access.

There is very little over there now that could not be

turned over to every single member of the House, if he was

adequately briefed before hand, but the deeper we get into

some of this, the more sensitive it becomes and the more it is

depending on who makes the reguest and what he announces

before he makes the request, which you might want to

reconsider.

Mr. Preyer. When he makes the request to the committee,

we would have the right to impose conditions on access at that

time?

Mr. Blakey. Our rules now provide a very stringent

situation, only he, and only written, and only in a designated!

room and no notes taken, and of course subseguent disclosure

is a violation unless he does it with your majority opinion.

In other words, he cannot come in and look at something

and then disclose it against the will of the full committee

publically and all he can get is access to it. But I think

that they have a

fear that the ethical violation by a member

of not living up to your majority rule might not be a

sufficient deterrent to the disclosure.

A/ chairman Stokes. I have a question and maybe Jim molest

is the

proper person to answer the question, but each time we

amend the rules, do we then again republish

our rules?

Mr. Wolfe. All we have to do is. add an amenâment to the

end, and we now have our pamphlet with one glued amendment on

it and we will have to glue the new amendment on at the end

and we will not have to republish them.

chairman Stokes. Also previouslymand I do not know

whether it is reguired by the House fules or nothout we did

put our rules into the Congressional Record, and are

amendments required?

Mr. Wolfe. Not necessarily. I do not think...we are

necessarily required, and they are püblic in the sense that

every person who gets a copy of our rules will get a copy of

this provision with it.

Chairman stokes. What about House members?

Mr. Wolfe.

If the House member wants access, it has not

happened

yet,

they have asked us

sometimes on the phone

how to do it, and we would send them a copy of the rules

and

the rule dealing with access would be at the end. In the same

way the Intelligence Committee's rules are public, our rules

obviously would be public.

Chairman Stokes. Are there any further questions?

I you will recall while we were in Cuba, Mr. Chairman, we

discussed on the beach one issue and this deals with an issue

that

is important. The Central Intelligence Agency suggested

the only way we could have conversations in private was to

stand on the beach and face the United States, that is out to

the ocean.

So, at certain times we went to the beach and faced the

ocean to have conversations.

Mr. Blakey. The tan covers the bags under my eyes.

Chairman stokes. While he was watching the United

States, got saw the latest maneuvers of the latest MIG fighter

200 yards off the beach.

Mr. Blakey. It was 20D yards.

Chairman Stokes. It was some display of its agility.

Mr. Edgar. Did they know you were there?

Chairman Stokes. Yes.

Mr. Blakey. The issue raises as follows: our rules are

explicit for no electronic surveillance and by that I mean not

even the wire tapping which is obviously beyond the pale, but

no central recording either.

Blakey.

The Supreme Court has decided a case on this

and they

have set up the rules that should

be followed

in this

kind of a situation and it would be possible for us to follow

those rules and not invade the attorney-client privilege.

Chairman Stokes. I was aware of that general principle.

MI. Edgar. Given the information that we have so far,

think we ought to put this in our thinking and think about it

very seriously before we get involved in any kind of action

at

thạt

this point. So, I would suggest

tatt

mall it over in our

minds and keep it within the committee structure and deal with!

it at some future time, because I think

that there are

some

very, very serious questions.

Mr. Blakey.

They are extremely serious, no matter what

decision you take.

Mr. Edgar. If I would have an opportunity to vote now,

would vote "ho."

Mr. Blakey. Whatever decision you make you run risks

and

that

it is not something tat has to be decided today, but it is

something that has to be decided next week.

Chairman Stokes. I think the gentleman is absolutely

right, that this is something that the committee needs to

think about, and have further dialogue with one another on,

and then we can entertain it at some later date.

Mr. Edgar. Before we adjourn, I would like to reiterate

comment I made to you, that it seems to me it would be

helpful in the next week or two to have at least an hour

meeting of our committee to bring together all of us to get a

summary report of where we are in terms of status with each of

the

investigations, the foreign contacts, the process of where

we are going, and I think we are in need of that at this

point.

attention of Mr. Blakey today and he is going to follow

through with that.

Mr. Blakey. There are a number of dramatic developments
