activities, HEMMING identified the above menticned letter
as one of about 60 form letters that he wrote and signed
as GERRY PATRICK, the head of INTERPEN.

HEMMING explained that in July, 1961, he and some
of his associates conducted a parachute demonstration wherein
the prees wag invited and atrended, and HEMMING and his
organizaticn received considerable national publicity.

As a result of this publicity, letters were received teresa
from all over the United States by HEYMING from young eee
adventurers and soldiers of fortune who were desirous of
joining HEMMING's organizaticn and participsting in eome
military accion in Latin America. HEMMING explained that sa
a result of a flood of letter: he received, he devised the
above form letter to answer questions about his organization.
HEMMING said this form letter was to give general information
about the organizaticn, to dissuade persons from coming to
Miami, Florida, to join the organizaticn, and to eliminate
persons who did nct have specialized training or background
for this type of activity. HEMMING said that this form
letter sets up a number of conditions that most people
making inquiry would not be able to meet and, therefore,
tended to stop people from coming to Florida to join his
organization, HEMMING said that if a person met all these
requirements, he would then write to HEMMING agsin and in
reply HEMMING would invite the individual to come to Florida
on vacation and if ke had the talent and ability, he would
be invited to stay in Miami sndj participate in survival
training in the Florida Evergiades.

HEMMING claimed he did not consider the above
letter in any way an instrument of recruiting or any
attempt to defraud or use the mails for defraud.
