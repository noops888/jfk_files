of reference:

fender this

There is a working agreement between Alpha 66 and

C.l.A. Extent of agreement not stated. VECIANA stated CIA persons

very nice but constantly asking for information but giving no assis-

tance.

bo CIA has given assistance in the form of developing

special rations and giving some of these rations to Alpha 66. Alpha

66 is required to feed 300 people daily. Cost of rations •98@ each.

Rations very rich in vitamins, minerals, etc.

Prior to the raid on La Isabela an Alpha 66 member

stole approximately $600.00 worth of explosives fren the CIA. Ex-

plosives were used in La Isabela raid.

do Alpha 66 has American members.

Is Mr. P are of these

e. VECIANA has been approached by Columbia Broadcasting

System for a nationwide, one-half hour radio and TV broadcast to be

held in November.

VECIANA has not decided as to whether or not he will

accept. Stated that broadcast is desired for only two days prior to

some US elections in November and he thinks this night look too policital.

f. VECIANA stated that raid on La Isabela was definitely

made, but not as reported publicite 3That plans had to be changed be-

cause of loss of mine.

AUDITION (C)

22 October 1962

SUBJECT: Alpha 66

the case of VECIANA, he starts with the V (for VECIANA) on the

large wheel and then matches the A (for Antonio, his first name)

on the smaller wheel to the V. Apparently each person has his

own code wheels. No person is supposed to be able to read another

person's message. Radio messages are coming out of Cuba to Alpha

VECIANA voluntarily told me that Alpha 66 now had the

capability of infiltrating people into Cuba but could not take care

of them inside Cuba.

VECIANA stated that CIA has made numerous attempts to

determine exact plans of Alpha 66, where weapons obtained, etc., but

that information given to CIA has been false.

Is he tellina Graves

the truth?
