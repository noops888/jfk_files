intonation

being conducted by the Select Committee.

I understand that it has been agreed between the

Defense Department and the Select Committee that all requests

for information from elements of Defense will be directed

to the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy

Secretary of Defense, Mr. John G. Kester.

I am therefore

taking the liberty of forwarding your letter to Mr. Kester

for appropriate action.

Sincerely,

The above response is consistent with a letter of

understanding, dated 5 April 1978, between John G. Kester,

and G. Robert Blakey.

The letter

essentially defines the

ground rules under which the House Select Committee on

Assassinations will be provided information obtained from

intelligence sources; that is, requests for information "

be stated as specifically as possible with respect to dates and

subject matter and will be directed to the Department of Defense

rather than any Defense intelligence agency...."

SUBJ: Request from House Assassinations

Committee

1. Have received inclosed request (TAB A)

for information from Robert Blakey.

2. His direct contact with us is counter

to his arrangement with John Kester which

states that he will direct all requests for

info from Defense elements to the Secretary's

office.

3. Accordingly, propose to respond to

Mr. Blakey with inclosed letter (TAB B) which

advises him that we are forwarding his request

to Mr. Kester for action - (Dan Silver concurs).

4. In meantime, have asked DDO to perform

search

. to see if we have any material responsive

to Blakey's request.

5. Request your concurrence in above

approach.
