he Larick Installation and personnel

Specific explos of the LEyPTY

Project o procress and contributions to the nub will be found in Section 3

operational - As notou in the previous Request for Project Renevel,

tie fomor LINITED property was sold to Lucushs, who as per forcal auree-

went with the Station, demolioned the old structure and cons-ructed & new

edifice.

undle it was initially conte plated to plece the LETTED

(rapiya band 7) personnel In the new building and to retaln the sane,

equal division of worload between LILYRIC onu LEITED; it wus later

sciaued to rove

the present LILYiu basenouse personnel (LIarric-l3, -i4,

E and -??) Into the new bago Inatead, along with the followins ancillary

mailicationa

An Increase In the hours of both the plotosraphic ad physical survelliance

coverage provided pron the new baco by the LILynIC oporatora (0600-1600

hours) during the reckdays and to have the LNITSD base provide

photographic and piusical curveillance coverase fror 1600-1930 hours'

on weekdays and dion $9J0-1700 hours on.weekenuls. These changos were

dictated by the followini considerations:

I.

The now LnIUSIT building offers a uuch better vantage point

for both photographic and physicel curveillanca than does the

predent complex which houses the LILYNIC anà LIMiDD hases:

Therofore, the Station ielt that the personel occupying thia

new base should be those poscessing the higheat technical skilla

and also those able to provide the cost thorough and coaplete

covorase.

Since tlic LITTED base now has anly one treined

operator while the LIyRIC bacchouse has three, the lIlyule croup

and a revision of horking hours was Indicates.

2. Jecause it was apparent that the covercuo of the LIuck

Installation would be a long-rense and continuing requiresent,

1.

On 24 January 1956, tho LICOcl run roported that LIPSTICK/LILYIC sae avatlable.

LINCHPIN was Imedintely. contacted with instrictiona to investigate this

possibility. Preliminary invostigation through the janitor rovealed that there

was a front apartient available wich was Ideally suited for our purposa.

LINCHPIN contacted the owner who atated that the apartment was not for rent since

his daughter was golne to novo Into it. The oner did offer LINCHPIN his

daughter's old sartant which was in the back of the building. LINCHPIN

contacted the daughter and found that hor apartment une not suited for our

purposes, and mentioned to her casually that should she not take the front

apartment, he sould be interested.

She told LINCHPIN that she didn't really

want it and would toll her father to rent it to LINCHPIN.

Subsequently

LINCHPIN agala contacted the oimer and me told that he could have the front

apartment o

2.

LINCHPIN has erecuted the contract for one joar for LILYPIC at sue.00 US per

norithe.

He plane to move fron the present RAUPEE base by 5 Februry 1956 and

place his furniture in storage for approsinataly one week.

The furniture will

be moved to the storage warehouse by one moving company and taken out of the

storage wareliouse by another noving company, Although 1t is realised that thie

series or moves would not cover the trail of the furniture to an experienced

Investigator, it will prevent questions by neihbors who nao the furniture boine

moved just one hali block and also prevent coments fron the moving men then

selvos

who would nove the furniture thie one half blook.

Since the RAPPER baso conciated of one bedroos and the LILYRIC base containa

three bedrooms, and is conerally largor in all rospects, it will be necessary to

purchase additional furniture to nake LINCHPI!"s occupancy normal in all

appearances. It is estinated that the requisite arount of fumiture needed for

Ente purpose will not accregate in excess a $500 US.

Further,

since this

apartinent is rather large for ono single man, LINCHPIN's brother is bring cleared,

and, after cloaranco, will nove in the apartent sith LIlcipil to sarve as

relief operator and lend covor lo the baso.

It to planned that Linic will bo kopt comlocal courtronted from LIaTRo

and other LiP TICK operations. LPTICY 30 will act as eul out betwen the

Station and LICiPli, and has boon Instructed that he la not to mention thie

duty to argone. Since Listick 2o does not know of the edstence of LIM.7ED.

the tiric oporation le oo plotely compartrented.

The LILYRIC base wil be prinolpally used for photographie surveillance of the

LIMERICK target, working alto nately but without any patters, with the liMiTeD

bad sim to both as die a to do cout by the on sid, the th

1111 be processed In the Station Inatuad of being sent to Janes U. ArCALL who

does the messing for LifTED. Later, the processing my be done by WiNCHPIN

In his onendcal laboratory In order to take this load oss the Statlou personmal

Involved.

LINCIRT has a fairly woll equipped chenical Laboratory that, with a

few nodificat one; could be uned for the prucessing of the filis und printo.

At prosent LINCHPIN haa a partner in this laboratory and it 1a planned that the

partner ulid bo cloared.

Thia Station aincoroly feels that by the alterative use of this bage with LilaTED

that mny of the outward olens of photographic surveillance (possibly only

apparent to the Case Officar knowinr: they wore there and locking for them) w1l1

be reduced, the acquisition of this base, in a senso, provides the best possible

cover for the LIMITiD baso by decroasing the uso of that base.
