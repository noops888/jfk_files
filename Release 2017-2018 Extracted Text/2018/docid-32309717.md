various means to have the matter squashed. DARDIS related
in stric fidence that one of his sergeants was approached
by HARRY AS. , one of the owners of Chary's Restaurant and
Coektail@Lounge, North Bay Village, to determine if he,
DARDIS, could be approached with a’proposition. LASSER indi-
cated that he was acting as a middle man in an effort to get
this matter squashed. DARDIS commented that his sergeant
told him a sum of $15,000.00 would be paid to DARDIS if he
would see to -it that the matter was dropped. DARDIS also
said his sergeant learned from LASSER that LASSER was acting
in behalf of S ;CHLAR, owner of the Treasure Isle Motel.
He remarked tha’ sergeant has set up another meeting with
LASSER and at that time LASSER will be told that DARDIS will
only talk to SCHLAR regarding the matter.

DARDIS further stated that he has discussed the
matter with DANIEL P. SULLIVAN, Operating Manager of the
Miami Crime Commission, and the State's, Attorney's Office.
He said the State's Attorney's Office is making plans to
secure adequate evidence with the view toward prosecuting
SCHLAR should he make the $15,000.00 offer to DARDIS per-
sonally. :

DARDIS also advised that another similar payoff -
proposition is beginning to move beyond the rumer stage. He ,
said one of his men was approached by one TMT eFONESON, olee
whose identity or background is unknown to DARDISNas to the
amount of money that would bereeded to pay off the Chief of :
Police so that gambling would be permitted at the Harbor :
Spa Hotel, North Bay Village. DARDIS related this proposi- :
tion is moving much slower than the one previously explained,
and as a result he is concentrating on the Treasure Isle
deal and hopes to obtain satisfactory evidence for prosecu-
tion of SCHLAR,

DARDIS is a new Chief of Police at North Bay Vil-

lage and a former New York state trooper. SAMUEL SCHLAR —~ >
is originally from Chicago and the Treasure Isle Motel has ;
been regarded as a criminal hangout. =

Captain JOHN CONNORS, Hialeah Police Department,
advised that X RUGGLES, a.Hialeah policeman, was shot and
seriously wounfed on January 24, 1958, in a gun battle with
CURLEY EDISONVESTES, an ex-convict who robbed and terrorized

olitician Bar.in Hialeah. He related ESTES
was also wounded in the left leg and.was apprehended a short
time later in Miami Springs. ESTES has been charged with
armed robbery and attempted murder.

The "Miami Herald" newspaper of January 24, 1958,
reported that lie detector tests were ordered for five mem-
pers of the Coral Gables Traffic Bureau on January 23, 1958,
after a discrepancy of $10.00 was noted petwéen the amount
turned in to the Traffic Bureau and the amount paid by an
individual, who violat a traffic ordinance. The article
related that RICHARD N.KRACO of Miami violated a traffic
regulati and produce receipt for $35.00 written. by
DONALD M, OLEY, Coral Gables Police Department, on a
slip of in white paper. RACO was skeptical of the re-
ceipt because it was not written on’a printed receipt form. -
The receipt was charged against the summons on file at the t
Police Department and it was found that only a $25.00
fine was recorded. The-article indicated that there was
evidence of erasure on the ticket in the Police Department,
which altered the.offense from driving sixty miles an
hour in a twenty-five mile zone, to fifty miles an hour.

{This article pointed out that. the penalty for a sixty
]mile violation. was $35.00 and the penalty for a fifty mile
violation was $25.00. a :
