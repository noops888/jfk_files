4. 93é0I6 left Havana for Madrid and Jondon on 9 December,
flying by Air Cubana at whe invitation of the Cuban Govern
ment: who alzo-paid for her fare from Lina to Havana. she
was of course the guest of the Cubana curing the month she
apent here; a car and a NL “ghaperone” were at her
constant disvosal. She wat, towevery from being
enbarrased by those attcntiona and evidently. coasidas.
thea no more than her cue sirce she was, in effect, working
for the Cubans tieasolves, rather than on behalf of any.
foreiga nouspspere, :

BS I found scvLe inconsistent in her deseription of how

she had covered. her; tracks. ta. @ sure. that. her Cubs visit
would not cone.to the attention of the jmerican: authorities.
The first tine we met she clained taat tao arrangencnts ror
her travel led been made in virtually clandestine conditions
with Cuban officials accredited to the che was anyway ”
going to Yrazil end therefore selected > Lima-iiavana route
as her way inte Vuday. ag she explained, the Cuban insizration
autiorities were briefed not to nerk her passport.e —-bhe
hoged that by following a devious route*out of Cuba. she could
eventually arvive in the States without arousing suspicions
about waere she had been in the previous two month: But,

- slightly contradicting this. apparent ewworn. to. conceal her
Oub2 visit she sumibtcs -en-anslioer occastoa-that i wis more
than :robable that the CIA would ruuble her and indeed, thoy
would know of her intention to come to Cuba since’ she had
openly requested permission to travel froa the 5' ate. Departuente
Her application bad becn refused, which, while it did not
surprise hers confirmed nor view thet the amerie:n authorities
were deterzined to victinise aer beceuse of her political
views: . certein other csatecories of Americ:ms were being
allowed by the state vepartment to travel to Cubas

. It was eviient froa SULU's own mudtled ond ‘confused
locic that she is uotivated by a profound and: almost
vitriolic hatred of, as she put it, the Us Government ond
its ugencies., whe reneatedly denigrated her Us citizenship,
eleinin- that it was the result of "an. accident of birta".
Bhe insisted that in evury other respect except her birth
certificate ehe was iatin American (drazilian) and not
Anerican. fier refercnces to her om Hotser seemed also.

to be slithtly contemptuous; clearly hor strongest
attachment. is'to her futher whoa sie described do the only
exception in "a family of fascists". . The aecber of the
fanily who appearsi to be her pet hate was a grandfather
resident in Yrazil who .orxed for the Hercédes Bens coapany
and had soma responsibility for the production of napala.

fo judge fron the frequency with waich she discussed her
father, I sh mest duflucnss

gccording to J.ULG it was her futher's growing dislike of

the New York Tines' political position which persuaded
him to resign and follow his own bent as » fraclance..
They botn believed that a journalist should express his
own "personal" views instead of those of a particular
newspapers .

4, ho abuse and vituperation which 52Uic poured out
against the Us seemed ag illogical ana ili-founced as hor
unquestioning assumption thot evrything about the Cuban
systen represented the nearest ‘thit biman society had
come to Utouia. Her naive onthusiasn for vhat she was
shown in Cuba, and her dogmatic endorsement of it ally
excluded any possibility of her reaching an objective,
assessment. fx example, the <odor lo;ular syston
which she visited had fired her. imagination ani she
refused to consider any of ‘the sore negative aspects which
ht have inplicd criticism of. the wuban cutaorities. °
Yow may care to note that che intends: to- publish-an
article on Foder Fopular in Jaraie magazine. (i would -
be interested to see a copy). ~

5S. As you usy know SZULC was divorced (or separated).
from Surart BISHOP in 1972 after only 2 yesrs of aarriasge.s,
Mer husband, she said, was a case for a psychoanalyst und
had necdei a nother rather than-a. wifes. o-ULG still seomed
to be confused umi depressed over ths aarriage although 1
d thit she hai taken the décisiou to end it

Her educational. buck:rourd.. sacs to-have heen
vory varied; apart: froa the vatablistasrts wontioned’ in

ur traces she said che had attended the sritish school _

Rio de-dJaneiro (et. which she picked.up.a phoney eaglish
accent she can still assune) and Berkeley University.

6 “I doubt whether the dividenis frou her visit weve as
good as she had expected. At our first. encounter in the
appartuent of Oleute REGIN she sade extravagant cleizs
about. her mission «bich.sho-imterpreted as being to assist
the Cubans in uncovering inforuation on CIA intelligence
activity on the island and -to ponetrate tae foreign and
diplom:tic community. for thin purpose. (it may seen-
renarkable that she should have been so indiserect: but
I think the explanaticn lies priuarily.in her naivate
and ready assumption of a sympathetic audience, in a
desire to impress aad a loquacity induced.¢ither by
alcohol or possibly by drugs of sone kind.) I: never
seemed to occur to her for a coment that in talking so
openly about the purpose of her visit she was in effect:
blowins herself... However, unless she leurned erester
discretion duriag the four weeks she was nere it would
appear unlikely that she cane anywhere new realising her
Aotentions. when we met on % iecenber sue told ne
spontaneously (after several stitf rum coliins') that
although she bud at last succceie: in making contact with
Cuban intellicence officers they were youn: in rienced

she wished to have. She couplained that she had spent
too mich tiwe with MINX officials who had no real idea
of the sain purrose of the visit and it had tren avout
two weeks to got tirouch toe a yerson with the anprovurkate
responsibilities. Kow that she was in touch with tis
dadividual she had asked for a ueeting with Hanuel

PINELHO. (Z do not know whether sho saw PINEINO before
she left, but I think it is unlikely). Up to that reint
&LULC bad passed the Cubans "useful" material on CLA
operations (mainly in Latin Auerica) but had received

very little in return, She was rather distressed by this
luck of reciprocity, pointin; out to me that she was after

7. In any case, it seems 3'.c nay have been. loss active

_ on the intelliscnee: front than she had expected andi as far
ag I know she had little or no contact with zeabers of the
diplowatic conaunity.  tuch of her tine was spent: outside
Havana visiting the éxevinces and in particular liatanzas
where sha was allowed a detailed look at ioder Popular.

8, SULC, intends to eune back to Cuba in 1975 for the
first: Congress of the: Cuban Communist iarty.
