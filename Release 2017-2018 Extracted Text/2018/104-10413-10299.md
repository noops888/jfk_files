I. Produet of the Project

A. Soviet Coverage,

Erniect IMPRAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet offleial

Installation In Mendeo City since 22 June 1960 when Frojeot ITKNOY

assed this responslbility. This freed LlfAT to provide, with 1ts

untlateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet offloials which

could better support not only the Station's CH effort but also other

Station operationa against the Sovlet target. In this effort, LIFEAT

covered the homes of four of the more notive Soviet Intelligence

Officers statloned in Marco during the reporting perlod. Samples

of the operational Inferation provided by ITPEAT follem:

C. Yugostay Coverage

LIFEAT coverage of the Yugoslav offfeial Installation In Mexico City

has proviced a wealth of information on the contacts.

activities, and

travel of members of that mission. Since the Station's effort against

this target was greatly increased within the last year, ITFEAT Infor

mation has been used extensively to provide the basie operational and

personality date necessary for this atapped-up progran.

Examples of

LIFEAT produced positive Intelligence and general operational informa-

ITFEAT/Soviet: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station

Efforts In this area mas amply displayed in Its support of Station

assets nounting a tocinical surveillance operation targeted against

the home of a knon Sovlet Intelligence officer stationed In Mexloo

City under offlelal cover. LIPEAT Information provided vital Infor

mation which enabled the Station to establish a pattem of setton

of both the fantly of the Soviet offleer and his maid. This Infor

mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry Into

the target, and contiming coverage (Ineluding Ilve monttoring of the

target line Imediately preconding the operation) by LIFEAT made

possible a degree of security for this operation which would not have

been possible without the support of s unilateral tap operation.

Further LIlAT soverage has, in addition to glving Information on

the dally activitten and contaets of soviet officials, provided an exe

cellent cheal en the contacte of three KIBARK controlled double agents

with their Sovlet Case Offloers. This coveragahhas enabled the respon-

sible Case Offleer to guide his operations with Increased assurance

that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control.

LTEAT/Cuban: LtRAT setivities In this area were concerned primarily

with suyport to the Asthur operation.

Coverage of reletivas of

ANSIRUT-2 provided an excellent "window" Into the operation which

enabled the responable case Offloers to move with more certainty

and security in developing his operation. The Case Offloere Involved

considered the LTIAT coverage an essential cheat on the activitles of

the principale in the case which was espeelally valuable during the

intial stages of the operation. Travel plans of ANSINUT-2 provided

by lut more also cunte to the timing of the operation Also

In the Cuben aes LIZAT coverage of 0-2 agent enabled the station

to gain an insight into his contacts and aoltvltles.. Further, recent

Initiation of coverage of a Cuban ComerolAl Offlelal gives evidence

of producing solld Information of commercial transactions and Mexican

Commercial contacts of the Cuban Government.

ILEAT/Tigoslars In addition to the usual information coneerning

the Yugoslav officials and their dally contaote and activitles,

IrAt provided leads which oould pay off in future operations.

One example was & lead which revealed that a diplonatlo courier

would be travelling alone and taking a new travel route while

carrying an official pouch. With this early warning, the Station

was able to plan an operation to provide nocess to this correspon-

dence. Although Headqarters finally vetoed this partioular oper-

ation, suffleient early warning was given by LIfEAT so that the

operation could have been carried out. Another example of this

type of lend was the date available fron IlVIAT coverage that a

new looation was being sought for the Yugoslay Embassy, and which

specifie locatiens were under consideration. Arned with this Informa-

tlon the Station has been able to make a teamieal casing of one of

the prospeotive altes and obtain Information necessary for entry into

the other sites.

As noted in paragraph 1. B. above, the looal office of ODENY

senniders this coverage "quite valuable". As aiso noted in previous

III. Planning for the Future

As was Indleated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes

to remin uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of

a great portion of LIFTAT resources but provide coverage of but one

target.. such as Soviet Embassy coverage.

It 1s added emphatically,

however, that should the need arise for LIFTAT to again assume such

responslbilltles, 1t 1s fully able to do so. Untll such time ITPEAT

w1l] centtrue to enjoy greater flexibillty in the employment of 1t=

assets, especially in the areas in nich the station does not wish

to reveal 1ts Interest or operations to the l1a1eon forces Involved

In the LIENVOY operation.

V. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for

FY 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00. The proposed budget for FY 1964

18 broken down in the attached Meld Projeet Outllve Reneral Request,

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

1. Area of Operations

This operation 1s run from Merdoo City Station and is concerned with targets

located within Mexieo City.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide, unflaterally, dally Information

on the notivities of offlotal foreign Installations in Mertoo and the personnel

thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selested individuals and

groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests. Presently..

LIAT stresses flextbility of coverage with support of Station operations and

CI/CE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis.

3.

Background

trojeet hit was originated

I on 3 October 1950 as a intlatoral telephone tap

operation.

Aetun Initiation of operations inder this authority occurred

on 18 Jamnary 1951, and the operation has run contimonly from that date.

The project was opened with the installation of a single tap and has grown

In the past eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in a elvan

month.

The ILKAT Project 1s a untlateral operation completely Independent from any

Liaison arrangement.

It is staffed by KIBARK contraet employees with the

majority of personnel being indigenous controlled agenta.

During the past twelve years, Project LIKAT has produoed more than 97,000

(estimate) pages of operational and intolligence Information in direst support

of lexieo City Station's specifle objentivos, and cantrtbuted materially to

the intelligence gathering astivities conneeted with the soviet Satellite

Bloe and more recently with the Cuban representatives in Meleo. In addition,

IJIAT has been of considerable value in monitoring the notivities of the

Amerton Commist Group In Marioo (ACIN), as wall as the antivities of the

exlle groups and local Communists.

With the LIENOY's assumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovaktan

offiotal Installations In July 1960, LVEAT assets were released fron contamous

such as IlIXAT, and extremaly isportant to the security and suncess of Station

operations.

having «perienced & namber of apparently Insoluble mrital problems, mutually

deeded upon separation and eventual diverse. Since their use in INFRAT (as

basehousekeepers) would not be pesaible with the breakup of their home, they

were terminated an of 30 Septenber 1962, Termination vs effected on a

mutually agrable baste and no snority problem has arian to date, nor is

any expected in the fature.

(2) LIFEUD-22 (201-288248) and ITYEUD-23 (201-305604), son and

mother, presently occupy the INFRODE photo basehouse and were never

directly envolved In LITHAT type work.

It had been orignallly planned

to use LIKRODE basehouse as the terminus for the ILLFEAT/ MKTRAP

technioal operation targeted against the official ITRODE mission in

Mexioo City. IJTEUD-22 and 23 were to have been the basehousekeepers

for this operation. When it was found that the MIRAP operation could

not be routed to this basehouse because of teahnloal considerattons,

the base was employed as a photosurvelllance base targeted agalnet

the LITRODE miasion. Since this operation 18 not comested with

LIFEAT operationa or personnel, these the agents will no longer

be carried under the IlitAr project.

(3) IXPEUD'27 (201-332331) was granted a POl on 20 September 1962

for use as an alternate IliAT basehousekeeper.

However, due to a

ohange of plans envolving agents's avallablllty for ITBAT WOrk,

she was never recrulted and this clearance was cancelled on 25

Jannary 1903.

10. Operational Clearanoes

See Seotion 9 above.

11. Cover

There ars no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously

employed In the LItAT opration. With the new agents employed since the

last project renal, cover 1s as follow:

hours and antivities are therefore not scrutinized by a superlor

his KIRAT salary without diffioulty.

12. Contact and Communications

Dally contaot is maintained between the Case Offfoer and the agents employed

In the projeet.

These contects are made in & clandestine manner with varying

patterns established for car plokups, foot contacts, and emergency meetings.

fre arranged slgnals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings,

When hoavy of bully material is to be passed, meetings are held at night.

Entrance to the basehouses by other than the basehousekeepers 1s made only

on the besis of striot necessity, such as need for equipment renaly fastallation

for new line coverages, or line coverage eut off.

As to agent recontact arrangements, there 1s little posalbility that project

LIAT could contime to operate in its present form in the event Merleo would

becone a "denied area" polioe state. It Is posaible, however, that certain

of the presently employed agents could be converted to straight II funbtions

or support agent roles. Recontact can be effeated by mentioning that the

person recontarting the gent is a friend of "Ingeniero Stanley" (title used

by David N. WILSTED with LIFEAT indiganous agents) and mentioning the IRAT

work the agent previously engaged in with "Ingeniero Stanley". (This recontact

method has been la1d en vithithe ITHAP Indigunous agente:* Bergeney.

commication prooedures have been developed which apply to the prement

operational enviornment, and are revieved periodieally by both WILStED and

the responalbile Case Offleer and are updated as necessary.

Telephone contact coneerning the projeet and with the agents 18 kept to a

minim, Fre arranged open code is used for phone conversations between

Case Officers and agents.

These systens of contast and comniention appear suitable for the preject

and function adequately fron the security and utility standpointe. Locations

and tines of metings are ruriend pertediony and ar changed frequently to

deornase the posalbility of arousing the suspieions of the residents of areas

In which metings are held.

13. Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors. ideology and

f'inanolal gain. A secondary factor 18 the fear of reprisal from the local

polloe should discoviry oneur.

14. Seousty

During the past project year there vere no incidents which were beyond the

capability of the personnel Immediately Involved to Isolate and remedy

Inmediately. In contrast to previous yeara, there was no instanoe of

telephone work erews approaching a basehouse to back or renove the tay

have been removed by the

vorkmen, but these are of no

danger to the operation unless a full Investigation In made of one of

these unusual cormetions. During the past project year no such Investigation

has been undertaken, and no suspicion of the LIFEAT

has been revenled

to date.

The greatest dangers faced by LIFEAT in the past year centered on two

developments: 1)

the continued efforts of the telephone company toward moderni-

nation of the Mexleo City telephone system and 2) the Investigation launched by

the Serretaria de Communtoaciones y Obras Publloas (SCOP) to determine 11 the

telephone company has not been providing maximm ponsible servloe to Hexieo

City residents by holding fron use cortain "spare pairs" of every cable and,

dIstribution box.

In the first development (which has been in process for the past few years

and was so noted in past project renewals) the most noteable inaidente which

effeot ITIAT seourity are the Installation of new underground cables re-

placing the old overhead telephone wires (thereby reduoing acoess to target

Ines and tap routing lines) and the Institution of a more effloient system

seriously with Inur scourity or efflotesy.

A number of ideas have been tried to bypass this problem but

as yet no satisfactery solution has been found. LIFKAT persomel are contiming

their attempts to negate this problem, too.

As to the scoP Investigation, which 1s presently being pursued with more

vigor than is usually found in Mextean bureaucracy, the problem here 18 almo

two fold. First is the problem that the SCOP erens have authority to enter

any (and eventually all) telephone distribution box and check baek an each

cornection In these boxes to see if they are actually 1n use. On one occast

they have rung back on a "spare pair" which was in use by LIPkAT to route a

tap to a basehouse.

Although no security problen ensued it in an example

of the daily danger faced by IlTRAT In this ease.

Another problem, and in the long run a greater danger to lAt, is

the distinot possibility that sCOP will force the telephone company to

use the "spare pairg" for providing service to new subscribers.

This

would eliminate LIFEAT use of these pairs to route tap lines to 1ts

baschouses, In offect leavins ITVEAT with no way to get the tap from

to the basehouse.

Even the possibility

of SCOP insistance on only a reduction in the number of "spare pairs" held

fron use by the telephone company could affeet LIKAT adversely, since this

would reduce the options ITWEAT has in routing its tap lines. However, until t

the investigation is completed, and no firm estimate of a target date 18

prusently know, the real danger of IlYEAT can only be speculated upon.

IFLID-1 1s alerted to obtain the reccendations of SC0P when elven to

the telephone company and al eltorte wil be made by llian personnel to

e1ther negate or take advantage of any recommendations which are placed

Into practioe.

o lesser the danage annecessary, but 1t 1s true that there can ocour a

situation which will "blow" the operation despite the best efforts.

15. Traintag

Inltial training of no personel and contiming refresher training for

the experienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outside" case officer,

David M. MC314). Minor repair and mintenance of equipment as vet as

emerg-noy security procedures are streaned and contimally reviend with

the agents.

16. Equipment and Support

With the funds requested for this purpose in last approved project reneral,

LTEAT audio and dial tape recorders were replaced during the past year.

Except for the usual problens discovered In equipment which has been

shipped for any distance, this now equipment has vorked well since initial

use in the operation, It 16 belleved that there will be no need to purchase

additlonal large anounts of special equipment for some years in the future,

provided that there is no radical shift necessary in the tap tramniques

presently employed in the operation.

PROJECT OUTTINE, PART II

18. Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1964. All fIgures

are U.S, dollars per year (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Mexioan pesos). Changes

In estimated costs for particular 1tems will be noted. These reflect not

only the continued inflationary trend in the Mexican econony, but also

the LIBAT operational emphasis of support to Station operations. In this

latter case partioular line coverage 1s of shorter duration, causing

greater expense 1n Installation and removal of tap lines and crosses and

frequent shifting of basehouse sites.

In the agent salary category total expense in contraot agent salaries vas

Increased somewhat (due to raises granted DRABAND and ZINSMEISTER during

,,the past year) and reduced eonsiderably in the flold agent entegory (due

primarily to termination of three well paid agents.) Overall funde

requested for FY 1964 total $83,808 compared to $99,000 granted for use

in FY 1963 - a reduction of $15,192. A great part of this reduction was

possible by prograning nornew equipment purchases for the coming year

(see paragraph l6 above).
