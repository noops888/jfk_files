installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Projeot LIENVOY
assumed this responsibility. This freed LIFEAT to provide, with its
unilateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which
could better support not only the Station's CE effort but also other
Station operations against the Soviet target. In this effort, LIFEAT
covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence
Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period, Samples

C. Yugoslav Coverage

LEFEAT eoverage of the Yugoslav official installation in Mexico City
has provided a wealth of information on the contacts, activities, and
travel of members of that mission, Since the Station's effort against
this target was greatly increased within the last year, LIFEAT infor-
mation has been used extensively to provide the basic operational and
personality data necessary for this stepped-up program, Examples of
LIFEAT produced positive intelligence and general operational informa-
tion on this target are as follows:

American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)

As noted in past project reviews, most of the targets in this group
have been covered at the request of ODENVY, and the raw take has been
processed by them. During thepperiod July 1962 through May 1963
approximately 590 reels of take were passed to the local ODEMVY for
their processing, On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This
office feels the coverage mentioned is quite valuable and many useful
leads are obtained from this coverage, particularly with regard to
travel in and out of Mexico of American Commmists who are in contact
with individuals on whom coverage is maintained". Typical examples
ef reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM are:

Operational Support. and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIPEAT continued actively supporting the
operations of Mexico City Station through the production of leads and
the providing of information on selected targets in the manner available
enly through the use of a unilateral telephone tap operation. Indeed,
it is in this area, secure support totthe Station's operations,. that .
LIFEAT is of greatest and unique value te the Station. The following .”
is a list of selected contributions by LIBRAP of operational

and leads provided te the various Station Case Officers and Station
operations as a whole:



13-00000

LIFBAT/Boviet: The valuable assistance whieh LIFRAT rendered Station
Bfforts in this area was amply displayed in its support of Statian
assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against
the home of a known Soviet intelligence officer stationed in Mexico
City under official cover, LIFEAT information provided vital infor-
mation which enabled the Statien to establish a pattern of action
of both the family of the Soviet officer and his maid. This infor-
mation made possible the setting of a time for the actual entry into
the target, and contiming coverage (ineluding Live monitoring of the
target line immediately preceeding the operation) by LIFEAT made
possible a degree of security for this operation which would not have
peen possible without the support of a unilateral tap operation.
Further LIFEAT coverage has, in additien to giving information on
the daily activities and contacts of Soviet officials, provided an exe
cellent eheck:on the contacts of three KUBARK controlled double agents
with their Soviet Case Officers, This coveragehhas enabled the respon-
sible Case Officer to guide his operations with increased assurance

“that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control,

pe
LIFEAT/Cuben: LIVEAT activities in this area were concerned

with support to the AMSIRUT operation. Coverage of reletives of
AMSTRUT-2 provided an excellent “window” into the operation which

in’ the Cuban area LIVEAT-coverage of G-2 agent enabled the Station
to gain an insight into his contacts and activities, Further, recent

was LIFEAT information indicating that the wife of BEKNAVE had become —
aware of his interest in another wonan, and later revelation of reass{gn-_
ment’ and travel plans of BEKIVE.



13-00000

LIFEAT/Yugoslav: In addition to the usual information concerning
the Yugoslav officiais and their daily contacts and activities,
LIFSAT provided leads which could pay off in future operations.

One example was a lead which revealed that a diplomatic courier
would be travelling alone and taking a new travel route while
carrying an official pouch. With this early warning, the Station
was able to plan an operation to provide access to this correspon-
dence, Although Headquarters finally vetoed this particular oper-
ation, sufficient early warning was given by LIVEAT so that the
operation could have been carried out. Another example of this

type of lead was the data available from LIFEAT coverage that a

new location was being seught for the Yugoslav Embassy, and which
specific locations were under ecnsideration, Armed with this informa-
tion the Station has been able to make a teclmical casing of ane of
the prospective sites and obtain information necessary for entry into
the other sites,

LEIFEAT/Bxile: As noted previously, LIFRAT coverage of the exile

- activities was the single major effort by: 7

year, In particular, LIFEAT coverage o:
whieh included lengthy periods of "11:

stressed too much. LIFEAT Coverage of a Costa Rican Commmist exile
resident in Mexico City has lead to a wealth of operational leads
MMEiing the discovery of this persen’s envelvenent tn a Commmist
funding mechaniem. Also, LIFEAT was active in covering the Spanish
Republican exile commmity in Mexico City during the GPIDEAL visit
te Mexico, LIFEAT coverage in this case was considered negessary
te reveal immediately any renewal of an earlier planned attempt on
the life of an GDYGEE official by one group of the Republican Exiles.
Ultimately, LIVEAT revealed the departure from Mexico of two of the
ringleaders in the plot.

LIFEAT/CIACE: At Headquarters request LIFEAT was established
on & former SMOTH agent whose past actions some suspicion of
his present activities, Proguct from this line has revealed an effort
by a group of this individual's friends to discredit the senior ODACID
official in Mexico, Early warning by LIFEAT has made possible the
preparation. of counter action (see HMMA-22364). LIFEAT has also

activities of this suspect agent. Continuing LIFEAT reporting on the
American Commmist Group in Mexico (ACGM) has provided ODENVY with:
great quantities of information on activities of leftist friends of

of the ACGM including their travel plans to Mexico and in some cases
Cuba, As noted in paragraph I, E, above, the looal office of ODENVY
considers this coverage "quite valuable”, As abso noted in previous
renewals, LIFEAT ability to give the interested case officers a check
on active and former agents increases the security of present opera-
tions and provides greater security for long t«im assets who may have
been in contact with now terminated agents.

Conclusion

Zt is the opinion ef the Mexico City Station that the support provided
other Station operations, the CI/CE information and-leada, and the
ability of the unilateral LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets
without revealing Station interest te the liaison forces, well justify
the expenditure of funds, time, personnel and security risk. As it has
been noted in the past, that evemwith the Station's envolvement in the

ge aT
the present ee donee an eee

‘t reason, LIVEAT, in addition to maintaining its present heavy

coverage, mist be available to onee again undertake coverage of the
official Soviet and Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore, ._
LIFEAT's present orientation, thoughhteward supporting Station operations
and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive
intelligence, leaves it readily available for recall inte the Soviet-
Czech coverage. Ft is the Station’s firm opinion that the LIFEAT
project provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilment the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive,

Xt. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a contiming nature and
are therefore not considered for fulfillment during any given peried of
time. For this reasen percentage figures as to completion of project
objectives camot. be dram. However, an indication of the coverage
provided in working toward fulfillment of the objectives can be noted
in. that approximately 12,500 pages of raw text were produced in the
period July 1961 through April 1965. LIFEAT has been in dafly opera-
tion during the review period with the average number of lines covered
per month being 18, and a high in Ostober 1962 of 25 lines covered,

III. Planning for the Future

As was indteated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes
to remain uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditures of
a great portion of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage ef but one
target.,.auch as Soviet Embassy coverage, It is added emphatically,
however, that should the need arise for LIFEAT to again assume such
responsibilities, it is fully able to do so. Until such time LIFEAT
will centimue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employment of its
assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish

to reveal its interest or operations te the Liaison forces involved
in the LIERVOY operation.

Vv. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 August 1962 for
FY 1963 in the amount of $99,000.00. The proposed budget for FY 196%

submitted herewith and in the individual contracts and oral agreements
(memoranda of oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the
various LIVEAP personnel.

RET / MADD

Even with the operational emphasis of the LIFEAT Project being
on Station operational support, it 1s thought significant to
include a list of HMM's produced through May 1963 (approximately
10 months of the project year) as a by-product in the LIFZAT
operation.

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

Area of Operations

This operation is run from Mexico City Station and is concerned with targets
located within Mexico City.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide, unilaterally, daily information

on the activities of official foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel
thereof, as well as coverage of the activities of selected individuals and
groups in response to both Station needs and Headquarters requests, Presently,.
LIFEAT stresses flexibility of coverage with support of Station operations and
CIAE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis.

Background

Project LIFEAT was originated on 3 October 1960 as a unilateral telephone tap
operation, Aetual initiation of operations under this authority occurred
on 18 Jamary 1951, and the operation has mm contimoualy from thst date.
The project was opened with the installation of a single tep and has growm
in the past eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in a given
month,

The LIFEAT Project is a unilateral operation completely independent from any
liaison arrangement. It is staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the
majority of personnel being indigenous controlled agents.

During the past twelve years, Project LIPEAT has produced more than 97,000 -
(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direst support
of Mexieo City Station's specific objectives, and contributed materially to
the intelligense gathering activities connected with the Soviet-Satellite
Blec and more recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition,
LIFEAT has been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the.
American Commmnist Group in Mexico (ACUM), as well as the activities of the
exile groups and loeal Cosmmnists.

basehousekeepers) would not be pessible with the breakup of their home, they

any expected in the future,

directly envolved in LIFEAT type work, It had been originallly planned
to use LIERODE basehouse as the terminus for the LIFEAT/MKTRAP
technical operation targeted against the official LIERODE mission in
Mexleo City. LIFEUD-22 and 23 were to have been the basehousekeepers
for this operation. When it was found that the METRAP operation could
not be routed te this basehouse because of technical considerations,
the base was employed as a photosurveillance base targeted against
the LIER@E mission, Since this operation is not comected with
LIFEAT operations or personnel, these two agents will no longer

be oarried under the LIFEAT project,

(3) LXFEuD'27 (201-332531) was granted a POA on 20 September 1962
for use as an alternate LIFEAT basehousekeeper, However, due to a
change of plans envolving agents's availability for LIFEAT work,
she was never recruited and this clearance was cancelled on 25
January 1963.

i. Cover

aati Ei
There are no changes in the cover of personne] who have been previcusly
employed in the LIVEAT operation. With the new agents employed since the
last project renewal, cover is as follows:

as LIVEUD-24 has natural cover of manager of a anall profitable

- medicine distributership in Mexico City. Subjeot's office
hours and activities are therefore net scrutinized by a superior
and subject can devote the nesessary time to his LIPEAT duties and cover
his LIVEAT salary without difficulty.

b, LIFEUD-26 has natural cover of housewife (wife of LIFEUD-24) and
omg mal pede eed oe el cee ren
ANNEX VI).

®. LIFERUD-25 has natural cover of the wife of a retired. businessman
(LIFEUD-4), A review of LIFEAT personnel files during the past .
year revealed she had been inoluded on her husband's clearance
request in 1953 but had never been granted clearance in “her
own right”, This was corrected when on 3 January 1963 LIFEUD-25
was granted a full OA.

Contact and Communications

Daily contast is maintained between the Case Officer and the agents employed.
in the project, These contacts are made in a clandestine mamer with varying
patterns established for car pickups, foot contacts, and emergency meetings.
Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings,
When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, meetings are held at night.
Entrance to the basehouses by other than the basehousekeepers is made only

on the basis of strict necessity; such as need for equipment repaip installation
for new line coverages, or line coverage cut off.

As to agent recontact arrangements, there is little possibility that project
LIPEAT could continue to operate in its present form in the event Mexico would
become a “denied area” police state, It is possible, however, that certain

.@ the operation unless a estigation is made of one of
these unusual ecommmetions. During the past project no such investigation
has been undertaken, and no suspicion of the LIFEAT been revealed
to date.

The greatest dangers faced by LIFEAT in the past year centered on two
developments: 1) the continued efforts of the telephone company toward moderni-
zation of the Mexico City telephone system and 2) tbs Guceaticatiar lsuuned by
the Searetaria de Commmicaciones y Obras Publieas (SCOP) to determine if the
telephone company has not been providing maximm possible service to Hexico
City residents by holding from use certain “spare pairs" of every cable and _
distribution box.

In the first development (which has been in process for the past few years
and was so noted in past project renewals) the most noteable ineidents which
effeot LIPEAT security are the installation of new underground cables re-
placing the old overhead telephone wires (thereby reducing access to target
lines and tap routing lines) and the institution of a more efficient system

As to the SCOP investigation, which is presently being pursued with more
vigor than is usuall} found in Mexican bureaucraey, the problem here is also
two-fold, First is the problem that the SCOP crews have authority to enter
any (and eventually all) telephone distribution box and check back on each
eonnection in these boxes to see if they are actually in use. On one occastéinn
they have rung back.on a “spare pair” which was in use by LIFEAT to route a
tap to a basehouse. Although no security problem ensued it‘is an example *
of the daily danger faced by LIFEAT in this ease.

Another problem, and in the long run a greater danger to LIFEAT, is

the distinct possibility that SCOP will force the telephone company to
use the "spare pairs” for providing service to new subscribers, This
would eliminate LIFEAT use of these pairs to route tap lines to its

from use by the telephone company could affect LIPEAT adversely, since this
would reduce the options LIFEAT has in routing its tap lines. However, until t
the investigation is completed, and no firm estimate of a target date is
presently known, the real danger of LIFEAT ean only be speculated upon.

situation which will "blow" the operation despite the best efforts.

Training

Initial training of new persomnel and continuing refresher training for

the experienced personnel are handled primarily by the “outside” case officer,
David M. WILSTED. Minor repair and maintenance of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with

the agents.

Equipment and Support

With the funds requested for this purpose in last approved project renewal,
LIFEAT audio and dial tape recorders were replaced during the past year.
Exeept for the usual problems discovered in equipment which has been
shipped for any distance, this new equipment has worked well since initial
use in the operation. It is believed that there will be no need to purchase
additional large amounts of special equipment for some years in the future,
.provided that there is no radical shift necessary in the tap techniques
presently employed in the operation,

PROJECT LIVEAT
PROJECT OUTLINE, PART IT

18, Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1964. All figures
are U.S, dollars per year (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Mexican pesos), Changes
in estimated costs for particular items will be noted, These refleat not
enly the continued inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also
the LIFEAT operational emphasis of support to Station operations. In this
latter case particular line coverage is of shorter duration, causing
greater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and crosses and
frequent shifting of basehouse sites,

In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries was
increased somewhat (due to raises granted DRABAND and ZINSMRISTER during

=the past year) and reduced considerably in the field agent eategory (due

primarily to termination of three well paid agents.) Overall funds
requested for FY 1964 total $83,808 compared to $99,000 granted for use

an FY 1963 -- a reduction of $15,192. A great part of this reduction was

possible by programing novmew equipment purshases for the coming year
{see paragraph 16 above).
