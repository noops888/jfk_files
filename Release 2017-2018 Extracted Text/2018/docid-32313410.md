DETAILS:

AT TUCSON, ARIZONA

On March 24, 1965, ROBERTMC CARTHY, 6020 North

21st Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona, a self-admitted member of

a the

e Minutemen", 1962-64, and Arizona State Coordinator

of the "Minutemen"

1963-64, advised that he had been given

the name of DEL MYERS as the man to contact in Arizona

with regard to the "Minutemen". MC CARTHY advised that

DEL MYERS had the number of 13056 in the "Minutemen" organ-

ization. MC CARTHY had corresponded with DEL MYERS at

Tucson, Arizona, in November of 1962 up until early 1963

when due to differences between them, he no longer heard

Ofrom MYERS. MC CARTHY was subsequently advised by ROBERT

DE PUGH, NOXbOrne Mi

Missouri, in September, 1963, that

MYERS had been dropped due to instability and that he was

becoming active in the American Veterans Against Communism.

MC CARTHY

was of the opinion that the break of

DEL MYERS with the "Minutemen" was a real sincere one and

no doubt was due to the difference in personalities between

MYERS and DE PUTH.

on March 27, 1965, DEL MYERS appeared in the

rucson Resident Arency and turned over material whieh he

stated related to communist sympathizers and supporters in

the Tucson,

Arizona area. He made available a copy of the

Congressional Record of August 20, 1964, which set forth

a telegram to Senator WAYNE MORSE, which telegram supported

cessation of the Viet Nam War and which was signed by approx-

imately 60 Tucson, Arizona persons.

MYERS also made availa~

ble an alleged report of the organizational meeting of the

Tucson Chapter of CORE of April 10, 1964, at which meeting

MYERS claimed he had a source of his in attendance. MYERS

also made available for study 3 x 5 cards on which

information concerning Tucson individuals described by MYERS

as communist sympathizers.

During the foregoing contact, MYERS orally admitted

that he was a member of

the "Minutemen" in 1962 but had dropped

become interested in the American Veterans Against Com

munist, a California organization, and that he was not a mem-

the "Minutemen" at the present time.

He further admitted

that he had a number assigned

to him but that he could not
