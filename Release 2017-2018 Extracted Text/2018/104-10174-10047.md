On 7 January' I contacted Tichborn who suld that he could be in

WashIngton on 14. January and that he rould have to return to los Angeles

by 3 February. I asked him what his fee vould be and he said that 1t

ves his understanding that he has previously talked in the neighborbood

of 51, 500 to 31,600. I countered by saying that in vlew of the shortness

of this trip I did not feel I could do any better than $1, 300, which he

accepted.

I unked hin 1t he desired that ve advance him any money at

this time or 11' he could buy his ticket on the cuft and that we would

make some. sort of arrangements while he was in Washington, and he

sald he would buy his ticket and that he would abide by whatever

procedures wn normally follow. I told him at this tine that I would

prefer

that ha bought a round trip ticket los Angeles • New York

Havona and that ho proceed that vay. I also instructed him upon arrival

In Now York to bury s ticket Washlagton - New York and return.

I did

this as I feel 1t Is preferable fron a security standpoint that he not

have any Indication on the ticket he will use in entering Cuba that ho

has been in Hashtagton Immediately prior to the trip or that he intende

to return there following the trip.

5. The substance of the above was communioated to Mr. Dahlgren,

C/WIL, 3, who agreed that in vier on the time factor 1t would be

preferable for Ilchborn to come on the l4tk rather than the 18th and that
