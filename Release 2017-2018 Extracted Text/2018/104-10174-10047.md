4. On 7 January I contacted Tichborn who suid that he could be in:
Washington on 14. January and that he vould have to return to Los Angeles
by 3 February. 1 asked him vhat his fee would be and he said that it
wes his understanding that he haa previously talkcd in the neighborhood
of $1,500 to $1,600. I countered by saying that in view.of the shortness
af this trip I did not feel I could do any better than $1,300, which he :
accepted. I asked him if he desired that we advance him any money at
this time or if he could buy his ticket on the cuff and that ve-vould
make one. sort of arrangements while he wes in Washington, and he
said he woul’ buy his ticket and that he would abide by whatever
procedures we normally follov. I told him at thia tine that I would
prefer that ha bought a round trip ticket Los Angeles ~ New York =
Havana and that he proceed that vay. I also instructed him upon arrival
4n New York to buy a ticket Washington ~ New York and return, I aid
this aa I feel it-is preferable fron a security standpoint that he not
have any indication on the ticket he will use in entering Cuba that he
has been in Washington immediately prior to the trip or that he intends

to return there following the trip.

5. The substance of the above was communicated to Mr. Dahlgren,
C/vil/3, who egreed that in view of the time factor it would be
preferable for Tichborn to come on the ith rather than the 18th and that
the price was right, etc. I confirmed the date with Mr wilh
contact Mchborn again, advising him to call me upon in
Washington on 14 January.
