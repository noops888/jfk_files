OCCURRENCE: CARD 2 of 2

J. D. (JAKE) ESTERLINE, who was head of the Cuba Task Force
in pre-BAY OF PIGS days, was regarded by the IG Report as
probably the most reliable witness on general timing of
these schemes because "he seems at least to have known of
all of them." (9). .

The IG Report was: "unable to establish even a tentative
sequence among the schemes; they may, in fact, have been
under consideration simultaneously." (9)
