Doar Mr. Diaz:

per month to coamence March ist. As 413 explained to yeu

ve feel that the Miani area is unique in that the dis-
locations caused by the influs of so aeny of your fellow
countrymen furnishes an excelieat opportunity to conduct this

study.
It is anticipated that you will spend a large portion of

your time jn our New York offices, however; at all also
reeuire a substantial amount of travel on your part.

If you are still in ugreenent with this propossl please
advise me as soon as possible. I sould like to begin this study
