ReBulet 9/8/61.

a Referenced letter requested this office to have
, sources recontacted to determine if subject held a other
ral insurance policies besides that resulting in the $185,000
\ claim which was paid in April 1949. $70,000 of this was

. held by Lloyds 6f London as reinsurers for the American

a International Reinsurance Corporation. of New York City.

: Referenced letter also requested that it be determined if

JOSEPH STASSI was recipient of any payment. (S)

ca a Reference is made to mylet April 27, 1961, which it
is believed answers this question and also to mycable, June 20,
1961, which stated no otker information is available regarding
this matter (and that Lloyds 6f London do not require details
regarding thé individual policy holders, but merely reinsure
other insurance companies against undue or large losses ](S)

This matter was again discussed with British
Security Service MI-5 and Colonel Cumming advised that the .
name JOSEPH STASSI is unknown to his source; that subject is —
only indirectly known to his source; and that any further
information available could only come from the original
insurers who are the New York City reinsurance organization,
as mentioned above. Mr. CUMMING stated his sources are Co
unable to determine if subject or STASSI or both received an :
the $185,000 insurance payment and as far as Lloyds of :
y Fondon are concerned, their only record of payment. was HE
$70,000 to American International Reinsurance Corporation ‘
Ri of New York City.(S)
