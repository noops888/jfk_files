COUNTRY: CURA
SUBJECT: Politicn

1, As soon as I arrived at the Hotel Conelia in San Juan, P.R.,
T received a visit from 'anolo PAY. The visit lasted 3 hours, The
conversatian wes lonp and dealt vith Cuban matters as well es the
affairs of the allied, western nations led by the United States of
dmerica. . He showed hic adairation and sympathy tovards the person
andxthe politica of the younp President. PAY considers the removal
of the missiles from Cuba a great victory over Moscow and as a halt
tothe communist advance under the hypocritical] proparanda of peace.

2. With specific reference to that which pertains to Cuba, he
feels that thanks to the "firm, enerretic, and realistic" porition
of the President, the United States has lent a freat service to the

Cuban cause,

3. About the expected invasion which he sat core near, he could
not, like all ‘Cubans, refrain from “supporting it and be nlad of it,”
and he sayn, even when said invasion fell throupl because of realistic,
political compromises of the President; the U.S. has rade it pessible
for world opinion to realize what Tidel CASTRO represents today, CASTRO
ia nothing more than a puppet of the Kremlin who has hanced over his
country completely to Pussia. As for the opinion within Cuba, RAY
believes it to be “highly productive,” since those who could still
possibly be in doubts have been riven the opportunity, thanks to the
energetic American position, te learn the whole truth cf the situation.

Thus, it terminated the myth created in Cuba by dia that Pussia vould °
go to war in defense cf his revolution,

&, As for the position of PAY toward the "Company", he is interested
in petting along well with that orpanizaticn, He told rez - "What does
one gain by having a controversy with them? That dees not solve anv
problem, and this haa always been my opinion, from the tersinninys of the
fight. So much so, he continued, that he han been interviewed by all
the agents sent to him by that orpanization, and "I save the preof. vhen
I had just left the "inistry cf Public Yorks over there_i bout June
or July of '60. I was then interviewed in-Havana by af [ee Ree: (one of
your agents) at his request. ‘y rood intention was so Clear tre despite
the fact that I would have preferred to see him at a place of ny own
choosing, because I knew the surveillance they had on me, T ayreed ‘tc ro
to his house, an extrecely canyercus thing in those days for an ex-Hinister

of the Revolutionary Covernrent.

$. As for the pesition of the "JUTE", he cays he has always sheen
(and it can be verified ty all the ravezines anc in statenents of the
press) that, it Jicitr and needs the help of the free verld ard,
ectally of the Arerican "leader" nation. This help ds asked cf
persons, institutions, ard of Covery

6. Upon my askine him for his opinion on putcing Pardo LLADA in
front of a nicrophone talking to Cuba, he locked ut me in surprise.
Later, sriling, he said, "It would certainiy do TIDEL a preat deal of

harm.”

7, On the 30th of April, at the wedding of Ema CASTRO, I notified
RAY, with great caution (because the (-2 did not take its ayes off us
for 8 moment) that FIDEL already had the proofs that RAY, Faustino
PEREZ, and David SALVADOR were conspiring. They were piving them enough
repe in order to catch them more easily. “They will not have the nerve,”
PAY answered me. "They have the nerve for everything and don't forget
that ever," was my reply. I am citing this conversation in order to
show you the vigilance that already oxisted in those days on Manolo PAY.

ie
8. 'T learned that they already had caid proofs, throurh an intimate

girl friend of Raul CASTRO whom I had known from the besinning of the _

Revolution, It is an interview, that I rememter well, but I cannot

remember her name. Besides, she shoved me @ larne black pocketbock in

which she was carrying the docurentarv proof. I understood then that

it was the G-2. I did not see her again after that date.
