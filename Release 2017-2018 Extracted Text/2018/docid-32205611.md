UNITED STATES COVERNNITED OFFICIALCUSE

Memorandum

TO

DATE: March 13, 1964

FROM : IOS/I - M. S. Mileski plen

SUBJECT: JACOBS, John Kedzie

IOS - 5076

On Wednesday, March 11, 1964, Special Agent Charles Taylor

of the U. S. Secret Service called at my office for the purpose of

enlisting the assistance of IOS in an investigation being conducted

by the Secret Service on behalf of the Warren Committee concerning

the assassination of former President Kennedy. As you know, Mrs.

Marina Oswald was under the protective custody of the Secret Service

until she completed her testimony before the Warren Committee.

S/ A Taylor advised that after the assassination, a Mrs. Katia Jacobs

(later identified as the wife of John Keazie Jacobs) sent a letter,

written in Russian, to Marina Oswald expressing sympathy for her

and extending an invitation for Mrs. Oswald to live with the Jacobs'.

Mrs. Oswald subsequently met with Mrs. Jacobs and according to

Mrs. Oswald, Mrs. Jacobs speaks fluent Russian. It was her

impression that Mrs. Jacobs was not a native-born American.

S/ A Taylor said every conceivable facet is being explored in

the investigation for the Warren Committee, and in this connection,

the Secret Service has enlisted the assistance of the Fairfax County

Police to conduct a discreet inquiry relative to Mrs. Jacobs in an

effort to ascertain something of her background. S/ A Taylor empha-

sized the importance of the Secret Service not being identified with the

investigation. The purpose of his visit to IOS was to review the

Security File on Jacobs for background and identifying data on Mrs.

Jacobs.

In calling S/ A Taylor's request to your attention, you recalled

having spoken with Mr. Jacobs who had previously visited your office

with reference to his wife's contact with Mrs. Oswald. The subject

of your conversation with Mr. Jacobs is a matter of record under

separate memorandum.

IOS - 5076

In reviewing Jacobs' Security File it was noted there is no

documentation that he has been married except for a reference to

his wife made by Anthony Luck who furnished information contained

in the FBI memorandum dated September 23, 1960. I furnished to

S/ A Taylor all the cross references appearing in IOS indices as

relates to Jacobs. ' A review of Jacobs' Personnel File was made

and disclosed only that Jacobs indicated on a group hospitalization

application that he was married to Katia, who was born on December 25,

1921 and that he has four dependent children.

In our meeting with S/ A Taylor, he asked IOS to assist in

developing more specific data concerning Mrs. Jacobs in order that

the Secret Service might remain in the background. We agreed to do

whatever we could and to keep him advised. Subsequently, a check

of Passport Division files disclosed that John Kedzie Jacobs was issued

a special passport on April 14, 1959. In completing the application for.

a passport he listed his spouse as Catherine Altschuller, whom he

married on June 14, 1952. He stated his wife was born at Sofia, Bul-

garia on December 25, 1921 and that she was a naturalized citizen.

Her residence was listed at 19 Touxemont Road, Alexandria, Virginia.

His application form did not contain her alien or naturalization number.

Inquiries are currently being made at the Immigration and Naturali-

zation Service and Passport files are being checked in the name of

Catherine Jacobs (nee: Altschuller).

On Friday, March 13, 1 acquainted S/ A Taylor with the above

findings and assured him we would keep him current on the results of

our inquiries.

ADDENDUM

March 16, 1964

Mr. Lipka requested a check of the Central Office, Immigration

and Naturalization Service on March 12 in the name: of Katia Jacobs

(also Katia Altschuller) with negative results. On March 13, 1964, he

was advised that the field offices of I&NS contained no record of Mr.

Jacobs' wife. It is possible that Mrs. Jacobs may have been previously

married and her I&NS file may be found under another name. We are

continuing to check Passport files for additional leads.
