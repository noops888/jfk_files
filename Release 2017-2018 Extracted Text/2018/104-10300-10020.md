UNITED STATE. GOVERNMENT

1STE:17 December 1959

A roview of Subject's file has been made in connection with

a request from the CT Officer. Franch Dosk, with reference to

the bulletin edited by the Repatriation Conmittoe of East Berlin.

"RODINA" (LA PATRIE), which is distributed in various languages

and 1s tahled in sealed envelopes, has been forbidden distribution

in Franco. (Ses attached thermofax.)

Security files reflect that in April 1957 the FBI advised that

Victor Petrovich KAMKIN, Elena Andreevna KAMKIN and Nine SAPELKIN

had been the subjects of an Internal Security - R type investigation

as of 1951 and thats

"There is no derogatory data of a subversive

nature in the files of this Bureau concorning the subject of your

inquiry (KAMKIN). It should be noted, however, that Victor

Petrovich KAMKIN is currently of investigativo interest to thie

Bureau and, accordingly, it is requested that any contact of him

in behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency ba handlad bu thin

Bureau."

MAS. SARacKIN

According to an undated blind memorandum (possibly a Staff C

Livad wilhthe memorandum), lina SAPILKIN is Elena KANKIN's sister and as of

-...

Samar, Philippino Islands under IRO auspices In April 1949,

accompaniod by her husband Semen I. SAPELAN and their two children.

She came to the United States in 1951 and lived in Tennessee for

a time with the KAMKINs. The SAPELKINs reportedly renounced

Soviet citizenship in Shanghai in September or October 1948.

The KAMKINs also wore born In Russia and KANKIN attended

high school and university in Harbin, Manchuria. Thereafter until

1945 he was in the printing and publishing businese in China; and

during 1946-41 says he was with "Special Services, Section II,

Consulate. From 194? to 1949 he stated that ho was the owner of

the "Anchor Printing Shop" in which the "North China Marine"

continued publication in Isingtao, China.

The KANKINs came to

the United States in 1949 arriving in San Francisco in Marche

As of 1957 KAMKIN was being uoed on an unclassified basis by

the CIA Ilbrary asa publications procurement channel.

It is, of

course, possible that Subject's interest in "RODINA" is on behalf

of thie Agency.

The other book stores involved in the report to the French

Desk were the well known Communist "Four Continents Book Store",

(M9m2000), "Imported Publications and Producta" (NS-2001-I) and

"Universal Distributors Company" (#91916) • These organizations are

registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Four

Continents Book Store is flagrantly Communiat, needs no defirings

and the "Imported Publications and Products" is reported to ke

one of the four principal outlete for Communist political prop-

aganda in the United States®

"Universal Distributors Company" Is

described as "an official distributor of. Communist Party literature"

and as "Communist controlled".

It is the distributing agency for

the four Continents Book Store.

Information from a reliable confidential informant reflects

that during the summer of 1959 KAKKIN Indicated he planned to

opon a branch book store in San Francisco to be operated by Se

SAFELKIN®

The store was to be called unanie, Fussian Book Store,

and located at 5237 Geary Street, San Francisco.

"Count ORIOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into

be identical with Alexander ORIOFF, DI-2881, a highly suspect
