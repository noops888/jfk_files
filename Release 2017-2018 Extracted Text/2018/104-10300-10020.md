Security files reflect thet in April 1957 the FBI advised that
Victor Petrovich KAMKIN, Elena Andreevna KAMKIN and Nina SAPELKIN
had been the subjects of an Internal Security ~ R type investigation
as of 1951 and thats "There is no derogatory date of 3 subversive

According to an undsted blind memorandum (possibly 3 Staff C

Gas iFAUS 190) was living with the KAMKINS in Tennessee. Nina SAPELKIN was
born in Russia 418 August 19123 and was evacuated from Shanghai to
Samar, Philippine Islands under JRO auspices in April 19h9,
accompanied by her husband Semen I. SAPELKIN and their two childrens
She came to the United States in 1951 and lived in Tennesses for

a time with the KAMKINS. The SAPELKINs reportedly renounced

Soviet citizenship in Shanghai in September or October 1918.

The KAMKINs also were born dn Russia and KAMKIN attended
high school and university in Harbin, Manchuria. Thereafter until i:
195 he wes in the printing and publishing business in Chinas and
during 19h6-l,7 says he was with "Special Services, Section IT,
Amph., Marine Corps", working on its newspaper, "North China
Marine". In 19h7 he was co-publisher of "Free Word? which he says
wae an anti-Soviet newspaper closed by pressure of the Soviet

eR


Consulate. From 1947 to 19h9 he stated that he was the owner of
the “Anchor Printing Shop in which the "North China Marine"
continued publication in Tsingtao, China. The KAMKINs came to
the United States in 199 arriving in San Francisco in Marche

As of 1957 KAMKIN was being used on an unclassified basis by
the CIA Library asa publications procurement channel. It is, of
course, possible that Subject's interest in "RODINA" is on behalf
of this Agencye

The other book stores involved in the report to the French
Desk were the woll known Commnist "Four Continents Book Store",
(M3-2000), “Imported Publications and Products" (MS-2001-I) and
"Universal Distributors Company" (#91916). These organizations are
registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Four
Continents Book Store is flagrantly Communist needs no defining;
and the "Imported Publications and Products" is reported to be
one of the four principal outlets for Communist politicel prop-
aganda in the United States. "Universal Distributors Company" is
described as "an official distributor of Communist Party literature"
and as "Communist controlled". It is the distributing agency for
the Four Continents Book Store.

Information from a reliable confidential informant reflects
that during the summer of 1959 KAMKIN indicated he planned to
open a branch book store in San Francisco to be operated by Se
SAPELKIN. The store was to be called Znanie, Russian Book Store,
and located at 5237 Geary Street, San Francisco. This S. SAPELKIN,
in all probability, is Mra. KAMKIN's brother-in-law Semen I.
SAPELKIN, MS-5000, who with his wife Nina, nee DAVIDOVA, aka
DAVIDOF, was the subject of an FBI Record Check Request in May
1955. (The wife Nina, per the check shot, resided at Route
1, Van Leer, Tennessee from 1951 to 1952, which was the KAMKIN's
address during this period.)

The 1955 FBI Record Check Request on SAPELKIN indicated that
he wae formerly a painter; that his wife Mina was a dentist; that
both were born in Russia; that he arrived in the United States
from France around the end of 1954, was atateless and had his first
papers; and that she arrived in San Francisco 5 June 1951. They
were residing at 1,05 Harvard Street, N.W., Washington, D. C.
(which was the address of Subject's book store); and had formerly
resided in Tientsin and Shanghai, China. Both their children
were born in Tientsin, one in 19]6 and one in 19h9.

An RI check requested in 1957 for USIA indicated that the nare
Semen I. SAPELKIN appeared in a report from a reliable seurca in
May 1950, which dealt with refugees in an IRO camp at Guinan,

Samar, Philippine Islands; and, according to the report, ho had
been a member of the Russian Residents Association (probably Russian



13-00000

Emigrants Association) and of the Soviet Club in Shanghale

An ONE name check on KAMKIN, in November 1954, reflected the
crous-referencing of hia name to "Foreiyn Service Dispatch, Hong Kong
#402, 22: August 1952", the subject of which was "Contact of Mre
Se VeniaminjVASILIEVITCH SAPELKIN with the Hong Kong Consulate General";

ran while ts of a 1957 "K" check based on this same "Foreign

/ Service Dispatch, Hong Kong #402, 22 August 1952, Secret",
reads as followst "Mr. SAPELKIN reported that he had recently
received various communications from a White Russian friend of his,
Mr. Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head of the Russian Emigrants
Association in Teingteo, China, Mr. KAMKIN left China early in

SAPELKIN and KAMKIN reportedly had certain contacts with a Eugene
GORDENEV, Russian-speaking officer attached to the 0=2 Section of
the First Marine Division in Tientsin following the Japanese Surrender
in 1945. Mire KAMKIN has now written to Hong Kong asking Mre
SAPELKIN to supply certain economic information on North China and

ate According to « 1955 RI check conducted on one Alexander So
peo

Re for G-2, a report of 17 May 1950 advised that ORUOFF (tho
had been described as an "Old Soviet worker") was closely associated
—-<° with Ventiamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN, an alleged Soviet agent at
the IRO Camp at Samar, P. I, As reported above, Mrs. KAMKIN's
sister Nina and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacuated to Samar,
P. I., from Shanghai under IRO auspices in April 19h9.

Veniamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN's friend ORLOFF, according to
a report of 8 April 1950, was alleged to have influenced a district
leader of the IRO Camp at Samar with pro-Soviet propaganda, and to
have worked with a oumber of other pro-Soviet internees in the comp
to Sovietize the Russian refugses interned there. According to a
report dated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was believed to be a
Soviet agent. (The report noted that this information originated
in the IRO Camp in Samar; that much information originating there
had proven unreliable; and that the reliability of this particular
information hed not been determined.)



13-00000

However this may be, it appears that there could be much truth
in the allegations. Information in Security files reflects that
ORLOFF very possibly is identical with a "Count ORLOFF of the
Russian Comnittes", (apparently a committee of TkO),“uho assisted
the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing
IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in
Paris who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSIIEV,
who was believed to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence
Service. "Count ORLOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into
the United States. Alexander S. ORLOFF and "Count ORLOFF" may well
be identical with Alexander ORIOFF, DL-2881, a highly suspect
individual of Russian birth, and a former AMTORG employee who was
security disepproved by OSS in 193. This latter individual, per
a 19h3 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count™,

A December 195) Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported
that unevgluated information dated 1 June 1948 indicated that ons
Victor N./KAMKIN was involved in a money printing transaction with
the Jap: 8, in which he uged the machinery of the Chihli Press
in Tientsin to facilitate the counterfittinge The source of this
information had pointed out the possibility that Victor N. KAMKIN
might be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was nemed
as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKOFF
was not identifiede) The memorandum advised that according to a
report dated 1 June 1948 from a U. S. Naval Attache, Nanking, to
the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. N. KAMKIN was a printer and
publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian
Publishing Houge/ known as Nashe ZNANIE.e He was closely associated
with Bernard S,/ROGARD of the Chihli Press, who in turn was
associated with \allegea Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN.

According to the Staff C memorandum , a report from the FBI
dated 1; August 1953 indicated that a scurce of unknown reliability
stated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a
possible cover in Tientsin, China, acted as a paid informer of
the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid informer of Us Se
Army Intelligence after the War. With the assistance of the
American Military Government in Tsingtao, China, he became Chairman
of the Russian Immigrant Society in Tsingtao in 1948. There seems
small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor Ne
KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was fonuerly head
of the Russian Immigrant Association in Tsingtao, China, accord-
ing to his friend SAPELKIN, as reported in Hong Kong Dispatch
#402. Note that Victor N. KAMKIN was in charge of a Russian
Publishing House in China kncwn as Nashe Znanie; and that the
branch store Subject. intended to open in San Francisco (and may
have opened) was aleo to be called Znanie (this work in Russian
means "Knowledge').

(Bernard 8. ROGARD of the Chihli Press, referred to

ae



above as a close associate of Subject anc also of alleged
Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN, is the Subject

of SSD file #35095. ROGARD is a former U, S. Marine whoee
