RE:

Newark letter dated 6/8/65

0-1 dated 6/29/65

The information in the Newark file concerning cap-

tioned matter has been furnished by Criminal Informants and

Highly Confidential Sources.

Newark has conducted no open investigation in this

case, since there has been no indication of violation of

Federal Gambling Statutes.

Further reason for no investigation

is that New Jersey State Police contemplates a raid of the game

as soon as their investigation justifles that action.

Two Newark Informants (NK 2381-C-TE and NK 2181-C)

have attended this game in the past and efforts are being made

to have one of these sources visit the game again in order

to assist the New Jersey State Police in obtaining & search

warrant.

In view of no apparent Federal violation and the

Lact that information avallable precludes submission of an

Intelligent report in the 166 classification, this case 1e

being placêd in a closed status.
