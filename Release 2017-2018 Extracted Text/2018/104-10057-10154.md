is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

+ aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record ‘of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's. HENMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel.CASTROin Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
Claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause, Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Communist Brigade, A reported sub-unit of this “Brigade”
(the backers of ‘whom have never been fully established) wa
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

a Guatemalan. government expose of this assassination plot

a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency
‘with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Ur. to Frank STURGIS: to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Intercont
snental Penetration Force, Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged.that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
+Force). was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
vand that members of this unit were connected with CIA, GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
tinteresting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
vanother cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
