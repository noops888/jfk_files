WEEKLY SUMMARY

Special Agent JOSEPH KORJENECK,

Thoroughbred Racing

Track Protective Association, who is assigned to the fair

Grounds Race Track, New Orleans, advised that jockey PHIL

ZINST was suspended indefinitely for using a "joint" on a

horse that ran second during the first week of February, 1964.

KORJENEO explained that a joint is an electrical device

used on a horse to make the horse run.

EVERETT RAMSEY, PCI of this office and a former

nationally known jockey, advised ERNST was riding horses

using a battery with knowledge of race track officials.

The batteries used by ERNST were purchased in New Orleans

from one PHIL CASTELLI, 2900 Moniteau Drive, St. Louis,

Mo.

According to PCI,

ERNST was using batteries with

knowledge of several New Orleans race track officials

and was caught when one official learned that he was

not obtaining information relative to winners being

ridden by ERNST.
