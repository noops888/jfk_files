The company was started during 1946 but did not become

Incorporated until 1952. The company ostensibly does

more than $200,000 worth of business annually.

Activities

of the block manufacturing operation merged during 1960

with a hauling operation and trade bills have been met

within terms.

The corporation was chartered with the State of

ennsylvania on September o, 1947, with an authorize

capital of $100,000 and the business was actually begur

during June, 1946, by NICHOLAS DI PASQUALE..

From 1951 to

on October 8, 1959, there was a merger between one A.

PRUNER, a general hauling firm in the Pittsburgh area,

and

LA ROCCA. ALMO PRUNER, born during 1920, has been active

in the hauling business since his graduation from high

school. ALDO PRUNER, born during 1922, worked for his

father who was engaged in hauling operations in the Bridgeville,

Pa., area and subsequently formed a partnership with his

brother.

ROY L. VEY was interviewed on May 15, 1960, by the

informant at which time he declined all discussion of

business. Informant, however, indicated that although ther

financial details of the North Star

have never become known to him there are indications that

the company does between $75,000 and $100,000 worth of

business annually and has resources adequate to retire

its obligations.

PG T-3, who has expressed an unwillingness to appear before

any future Federal

JOHN CONTI and ROY ViY are still operating the North Star

cement block company in the absence of LA ROCCA. CONTI who

has assumed the post of overall manager and VEY who may

be considered the general plant manager are both extremely

critical of the PRUNER brothers, ALMO and ALDO, who hold

the lesser executive positions with the company and are

Important stockholders.

He said that

on March 3, 1961, a

business meeting of "department heads" was called for 8:05 AM

and that CONTI, VEY and ALMO PRUNER were in attendance. He

said that PRUNER as head of the department of sales and

collections made a presentation to the other two who were

not only extremely critical of his presentation but criticized

the job he has been doing in his capacity as an executive.

The aforementioned Informanton advised that the general

financial picture at the North Star Cement Block Company 1s

not completely rosy but portends some new developments and

sales techniques.

He said that he gleaned the following

information from his understanding of the meeting:

Cement block sales are static but it can readily be seen

that block sales are not enough to keep the company on

a stable basis and that bullding supply material sales are

necessary to augment the company income. By operating on

"sales as needed" basis it was shown that North Star,

during February, 1961, achieved 37 per cent of its sales in

the bullding supply field.

organizational officials believe

this is a significant trend and one which will probably be

exploited fully by LA ROCCA upon his return from Florida.

It is believed certain prices on material such as mortar

can

be lowered for competitive purposes.

It is now being offered

at $4.50 a barrel and accounts have shown no alarming changes

as a result, although competitors are selling at $4.70.

North Star

is definitely endeavoring to expand under the

guiding hand of LA ROCCA who has promised the company as much

money as it needs.

He wants to see definite progress in

sales and ingenuity however, before parting with his money and
