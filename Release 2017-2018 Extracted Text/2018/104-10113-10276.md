SUBJECT: LANZ, Pedro Diaz

03

1. On 3 July 1959 Mr. C

] WH Division, telephoned

having a cite start a

my home, stating that he was unable to contact anyone in the

Alien Affairs Staff and that General Cabell was interested in

having a contact made with Inmigration on an expedite basis.

2. Mr. (03 )stated that Subject, the former head of the

Cuban Air Force, surreptitiously left Cuba and entered Miami on

2 July 1959. He was apprehended there by the Immigration and °3

Naturalization Service and is still in I&NS custody. Mr.

stated that the FBI has talked to Subject; and that the Wi rep-

rar да. ка

resentative, Bernard Reichardt, has been in contact with the

Head of the

Immigration Service in Miami. He has asked that

Subject be turned over to him for possible movement to Washing-

ton.

Mr. Reichardt stated that relationships between the Immi-

gration and Naturalization Service and himself were very good,

but that the District Director of I&NS in Miami had stated that

his Headquarters in Washington had ordered him not to release

Subject.

3. Mr.

stated that General Cabell has been in con-

tact with the State Department, especially Bill Snow, Deputy

Director of Inter-American Affairs, and that Snow has the con-

currence of Secretary Rubottom, who agrees with General Cabell

hat subject should be turned over to CiA Ior exploitation. Mr

Istated that General Cabell directed that Immigration b

contacted to effect the release of Subject to CIA.

*. I contacted Herb Nice at his home and explained the

situation to him.

He stated that he would attempt to contact

the proper officials in I&NS to effect the turnover. Some three

hours later Mr. Nice returned my call, stating that due to the

holiday weekend, he had had difficulty locating l&is officials

and be has learned that General Swing had issued orders that

Subject's parole be revoked and that Subject would be held in

the custody of I&NS; that the Regional Director from Richmond,

a Mr. Shoneberger, would go to Miami on the case. Mr. Nice

stated it was his understanding that, because there was some

possible friction between the Army people in Miami and CIA, as

well as other possible agencies, General Swing had decided to

Keep Subject In IaNS"

custody and make him available to any author-

ized Agency who wished to talk to him.

5• Preparatory to a possible turnover to CIA, I contacted

Jim O'Connell, SSD, for possible support in moving Subject to

Washington. After learning of General Swing's decision to keep

Subject in custody in Miami, I cancelled the support request to

Mr. O'Connell.

6. Later in the dayl

WE Division, telephoned to

state he had been in contact with General Cabell and that General

Cabell had contacted General Willems, Assistant Chief of Staff,

Intelligence, Army, who authorized General Cabell to state that

he concurred in the turn over of Subject to CIA. Mr.

stated that Air Force and State also concurred in this turnover.

further stated that General Cabell was interested in being

certain that Subject was not surfaced.

7. I relayed this information to Mr. Nice, Immigration and

Naturalization Service, and he stated that he would inform the

necessary officials.

Mr. Nice also stated there was no intention

on the part of ISNS to have any publicity concerning subject, but

that it might involve a situation with a newspaperman which could

not be controlled and inadvertently publicity might result, even

though it was Inmigration's intention to not publicize the fact

that Subject is being held.

03.

8. I recontacted Mr.

Jand he stated that General

Cabell would probably be in touch with General Swing, Commissioner.

of Immigration in Miami.

9. On 5 July 1959 Mr. Nice telephoned to state that he had

received a call from Mr. Henessey who is General Swing's Executive.

Assistant and that it was his understanding that General swing

would be telephoning General Cabell to discuss the situation. Mr.

Nice stated that he also understood that General Cabell had indi

cated to General Swing that the CIA man, Reichardt, had not been

permitted to see Subject. I advised Mr. Nice that there must be

some misunderstanding on this point, since I had indicated to Nice

on Friday, 3 July, that Reichardt had seen Subject and that I had

received this information from the persons who were in touch with

General Cabell. Mr. Nice stated that this apparently was some-

thing that the two generals would have to iron out.
