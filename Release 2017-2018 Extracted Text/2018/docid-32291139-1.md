Will continue efforts to develop sources

in a position to furnish continuing intelligence information

concerning the activities of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA as a

"Commission" member and

"family boss,"

as well as

identification of "family"

members.

ADMINISTRATIVE

Philadelphia airtel to Pittsburgh dated 8/25/63

makes reference to New York airtel of 8/5/63 in which

information was received from NY 4008-PC in which the informant

identified a photograph of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA as

being identical with an individual known to him as "BIG

JOHN,", who controls Palumbo's Restaurant in Philadelphia,

as well as shylocking, bookmaking, and racketeering in

Philadelphia.

Investigation by the Philadelphia Office

reflects that SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA,

'Commission" member,

Pittsburgh Division, is not associated with Philadelphia

racket activities nor apparently identical with the

individual observed by the informant.

Information in this report making reference to

WILLIAM "BIG BILL" LIAS has already been furnished to the

Bureau and Detroit by Cleveland; therefore, no copy of this

report is being furnished to Detroit.

Leads have previously been set out to Chicago to

further identify PAOLINELLO, a gunman allegedly hired by

NICOLO GENTILE in the past,

as well as his relationship

with SIGNOR D'ANDREA, former head of the Chicago "family."

Other information contained in this report

suggesting possible leads or investigation by other offices

has been previously set out in substantive case files

pertaining to individuals whose names appear in this report.

Pittsburgh report of 7/31/63 contains additional

information not included in this report which was submitted

since 6/1/63.
