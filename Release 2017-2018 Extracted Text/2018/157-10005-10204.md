@ He said he "understood" the situation and "in due time might

states, "There is no indication that General Carter was
further briefed on the full details of the assassination plot
against Castro."

private investigator who served as the Agency's contact with
Roselli during Phase I.

1966 when the CIA intervened with the Long committee. He
excused Maheu as a witness in its investigation of invasions

vities so that Morgan would be able to decide how best to
represent him.
