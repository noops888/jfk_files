MEMORANDUM FOR: NARA Reviewers
FROM: CIA Historical Review Program

SUBJECT: Explanation of Contents of This Box

This box contains scheduled records from the Central
Intelligence Agency, transferred to the National Archives and
Records Administration under provisions of the Memorandum of
Understanding of 6 September 1989 between the Director of
Central Intelligence and the Archivist of the United States.

This job consists of the seventeen boxes that make up the
CIA Operations Diectorate's complete file on presidential
assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. The job is a subset of the 80-box
Kennedy Assassination file.

The contents of this box are categorized relative to their
releasability into four groups:

1. The record copies of documents which CIA hereby
releases in full and transfers to NARA;

2. Electrostatic copies of documents.which have been
sanitized to protect intelligence sources or methods. (CIA
will retain the record copies and identical eléctrostatic
sanitized copies of these documents in its archival
storage);

3. Pink withdrawal cards which identify all documents
that currently must be withheld in full to protect
intelligence sources or methods (CIA will retain the
record copies of these documents in its archival storage);
and

4. Documents originated in agencies other than CIA.
These are flagged by red bands identifying the originating
agency.

There are no restrictions on the unflagged part of this
submission, and the CIA equities contained therein are released.
Those parts that are flagged by red bands contain intelligence
equities of other agencies and will need to be handled by NARA
in accordance with its agreements with those agencies.

MEMO

FROM:

5 June 1997

FOR: Bob Skwirot, ARRB Staff
Frank Most, HRG Staff

SUBJECT: Orphans and Strays

From

From

When

the January Board Determination package:

104-10066-10010. This was returned to HRG in the
January package but was not on the Board Determination
list. I returned it to you, c.10 March. It isa
sanitized document; no previous dup; needs Board
review.

104-10066-10226. This was returned to HRG with the
January package but was “crossed with 104-10066-10232”
(whatever that means). I returned both to you c.10
March, presumably after getting them uncrossed. Both
need to be sanitized and both have no dups. 10226 was
on the determination list; 10232 was not.

180-10108-10017. This has a problem regarding Secret
Service equities. You were going to advise me after
checking with one of your staff and/or S.S. I have
copies.

the December Board Determination package:
104-10068-10139. This cable (DIR 84946), referenced in
my note of 6/4/97, is the one that had been wrongly
attached to 68-141. It has no dups, is sanitized, has
not had the Board's blessing. You may have copies?
104-10065-10366. Returned to HRG with December package
but not on the determination list. No dups; sanitized;
needs Board review.

you have a chance.....

Thanks,

Frank

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS
RELEASE IN FULL
2000 11 August 1997
TO: Bob Skwirot, ARRB Staff
FROM: Frank Most, HRG Staff

Enclosed are four documents that were the subject of our
telecons last week:

Two are replacement copies for items missing from

the January reconsiderations group; one from the
December Board determinations list. (They are labeled).
The fourth item is a leftover from the December list
that had a problem with a missing page two. The missing

page - which we found a copy of - needs a redaction
that was not seen by the Board.

These two problems were referred to me by Dick, 9/26:
104-10052-10015. Correction to release #19 on page 3.
104-10063-10349. This was simply a missing document,

although I found we had hit it with the wrong stamp--
now corrected.

7 October 1997
TO: Bob Skwirot, ARRB Staff
FROM: Frank Most, HRG Staff
SUBJ: HSCA Documents from March Board Determinations.

Bob, I think I have completed all the corrections
indicated in your note of 18 August, attached. The
following notes respond to other comments in your
note:

180-10141-10222. The routing sheet is a previously--
redacted document, as indicated in the comments in
104-10023-10019,-10025, & -10080, all in JFK13, ,Fil.

qeee 10142-10116. Responsive to your first note “we! i
released “1960”; responsive to your second note
ave released the words “up to” but continue to
protect Mexicans’.

180-10142-10240.. Your note says simply “Check with CIA”
-- no other clue. The Board determination summary says
“operational details”. As I see it the deletions we
have taken (p.4) are in compliance with the Board's
summary .

180-10143-10090. I have entered Scelso as appropriate
but, for some reason, I have no unredacted copy, no
yellow sanitized copy. We think we know (guessing) what
deletion #7 on p.5 is, and are prepared to release it,
but without an unredacted copy we can not be sure. We
are holding this item back pending receipt of an

1. During your absence I spoke with Ben Rockwell

not find the documents there.

2. I have looked around here but have not found them
here either. When you get a chance, could you please
recheck down there for those documents (the ones with the
red-brackets and codes). We need them for filing with our
HRP retention copies in the JFK files.

SUBJECT: March 1998 Meeting Documents - Discrepancies
in Identification Aids

1. The March meeting document inventory list contains
discrepancies involving the following identification aids:

104-10175-10143 not currently listed on the
inventory; should be added
reflecting 2 redactions. (The
document, with ARRB red brackets
and codes) was erroneously’ attached
to the ID AID 104-10175-10146.)

104-10175-10145 correctly shown on inventory
with one redaction; no change
needed

104-10175-10146 The document correctly identified

by ID AID 104-10175-10146 was
erroneously attached to the ID

Aid 104-10175-10147. The document,
with ARRB red brackets and codes,
reflects 3 redactions (vice the 2
currently shown for 10146) .

104-10175~-10147 should be deleted from the
inventory list. That document
has not yet been processed by ARRB.

2. The documents’ in question are available for review.
Please let me know if you need further clarification.
