MEMORANDUM FOR:

NARA Reviewers

FROM:

SUBJECT:

CIA Historical Review Program

Explanation of Contents of This Box

This box contains scheduled records from the Central

Intelligence Agency, transferred to the National Archives and

Central Intelligence and

the Archivist of the United States.

This job consists of the seventeen boxes that make up the

CIA Operations Diectorate's complete file on presidential

assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. The job is a subset of the 80-box

Kennedy Assassination file.

The contents of this box are categorized relative to their

releasability into four groups:

1. The record copies of documents which CIA hereby

releases in full and

transfers to NARA;

2. Electrostatic copies of documents which have been

sanitized to protect intelligence sources or methods. (CIA

will retain the record copies and identical electrostatic

sanitized copies of these documents in its

archival

storage);

3. Pink withdrawal cards which identify all documents

that currently must be withheld in full to protect

intelligence sources or methods (CIA will retain the

record copies of these documents in its archival storage);

and

4. Documents originated in agencies other than CIA.

These

are flagged by red bands identifying the originating

than citing

agency.

There are no restrictions on the unflagged part of this

submission, and the CIA equities contained therein

are released.

Those parts that are flagged by red bands contain intelligence

equities of other agencies and will need to be handled by NARA

accordance with its agreements with those agencies.

MEMO FOR: Bob Skwirot, ARRB Staff

FROM:

Frank Most, HRG Staff

SUBJECT: Orphans and Strays

From the January Board Determination package:

L04-10066-10010. This was returned to HRG in the

January package but was not on the Board Determinatior

c.10 March. It is a

sanitized document; no previous dup; needs Board

review.

104-10066-10226. This was returned to HRG with the

January package but was "crossed with 104-10066-10232"

(whatever that means). I returned both to you c.10

March, presumably after getting them uncrossed.

Both

need to be sanitized and both have no dups. 10226 was

on the determination list; 10232 was not.

180-10108-10017. This has a problem regarding Secret

Service equities. You were going to advise me after

checking with one of your staff and/or S.S. I have

copies.

From the December Board Determination package:

104-10068-10139. This cable (DIR 84946), referenced in

my note of 6/4/97, is the one that had been wrongly

attached to 68-141. It has no dups, is sanitized, has

not had the Board's blessing. You may have copies?

104-10065-10366. Returned to HRG with December package

but not on the determination list. No dups; sanitized;

needs Board review.

When you have a chance.....

Thanks,

Frank

FROM: Frank Most, HRG Staff

Enclosed are four documents that were the subject of our

telecons last week:

Two are replacement copies for items missing from

the January reconsiderations group; one from the

December Board determinations list. (They are labeled) .

The fourth item is a leftover from the December list

that had a problem

with a missing page two. The missing

page - which we found a copy of - needs a redaction

that was not seen by the Board.

FROM: Fxank Most, HRG Staff

SUBJ: HSCA Documents from March Board Determinations.

Bob, I think I have completed all the corrections

indicated in your note of 18 August, attached. The

following notes respond to other comments in your

note:

180-10141-10222. The routing sheet is a previously-*

redacted

document,

indicated in the

comments in

104-10023-10019,-10025, & -10080, all in JFK13, F11.

180-10142-10116. Responsive to your first note we

have released "1960"; responsive to your second note

we have released the words "up to" but continue to

protect ("Mexicans".

180-10142-10240. Your note says simply "Check with CIA"

-- no other clue. The Board determination summary says

"operational details"

• As I see it the deletions we

have taken (p.4) are in compliance with the Board's

summary.

180-10143-10090. I have entered Scelso as appropriate

but, for some reason, I have no unredacted copy, no

yellow sanitized copy. We think we know (guessing) what

deletion #7 on p.5 is, and are prepared to release it,

but without an unredacted copy we can not be sure. We

unredacted page 5 from you, please.
