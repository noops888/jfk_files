Dear Me. Lake:

No other ethic is as well-established and as

essential to the success of the intelligence community

as

che prosection ot intelligence sources and methods and

the

safeguarding of confidences.

The effectiveness of the U.S.

Covezament's intolligence and councerintelligence programs

is signiticantly accributable co che historical commitment

by the agencies which cosduct these activities to those

principles.

Disclocure of chu identities of sources has

had and may be expected to have a profound effect upon the

ability of the incelligence agencies to obtain the

zonfidential assistance of persons whose cooperacion is

dependent upon assurance o= continuing ConfidentialiY.

Similarly.

the disclosure of informataon about intelligence

sources and methods has caused and will prediccably resuls

in the development of countemeasures which will airect the

ability of the United Scates to provide the President wich

camely and high-qualicy intelligence and detect and addzess

hostile incelligence activitzes directed against the

United States.

The agencies represented by the National Counter-

intelligence Policy Board unanimously chare, and hereby

express, their concera that chese fundamental principles could

be compromised by an inappropziate commitment to disclosure

Dy the Assassination Records Review Board (the Board) in

ics administzation of the John E. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act of 1992 (the Act).

DRAFT EBTTER 10 ANTHONY LAKE.

Honorable Anthony Lake

NATIONAL SECURITE COUNCTI

To date, the response by the intelligence agencies

to Board requests

for the release of documents has been

unprecedented.

The Federal Bureau of Investigacion (FBI) for

examole, has released over 613,000 documents to the National

Archives and Records Administration and has requested that

disclosure be postponed wich respect to portions of only 4.37

percent of chose documents.

The FBI has sought poseponement

with respect to limited portions of that modest number of

records based upon expressed concern by foreign governments

which contributed or originated the intomacion and reluctance

to reveal the identities of intelligence assets or intelligence

sources and mechods.

The Act permits the postponement of disclocure upon

presentation of clear and convincing evidence that the theat

to the milicary defense,

incelligence operations, of roreign

relations of the Uniced

States posed by public disclosure

outweighs the public interest in disclosure and that such

disclosure would reveal:

an intelligence agent whose identity currently

requires protection: or

(3) an intolligence source or method which is

curzontly utilized, or reasonably expected to be

utilized, by the United States Goverament and which

has not been officially disclosed. the disclosure of

which would

intertere wich the conduct of intelligence

activities.

(See Act, Sections 6(1) (A, (A,3) )

The Ace furcher permits the postponement of

disclosure upon a showing, by clear and convincing evidence,

that public disclosure would compronise

the existence of an

understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection

between a government agent and a

cooperating individual or a

foreign governmens, and public disclosure would be so hazmiul

that it outweighs the public interest. (See Act, Section 6(4))

DRAET LETTER TO ANTRONX LAKR

Honorable Anthony Lake

NATIONAL, SECURTTY COUNCIL

The Board's rejection of postponements proposed

under thece Sections of the Act dismisses che fact that the

incelligence agencies are uniguely qualified to assess che harm

to intelligence operations which would result from disclosure

ot the identities of intelligence assets of revelations about

incelligence sources and methodo. It rcmains essential chat

to protect those persons or govemments.

It is similariy

essential that sources, methods, and technigues which have

bad value in the past and could

be expected to have value in

identities of intelligence assets or revelation of souices

and methods, including the confidential cooperation of

forcign goverrments, would enervate u.S. intelligence and

counterintelligence programs and discourage che confidential

coopezation on which the successful conduct of effective

intelligence is dependent.

that the harm which would result from such disclosures would

would reste

The intelligence community believes

demonstrably impair the national security of the United States

and that the clear and convincing evidence standard does acc

require that it divine, with absolute precision, the specific

mannex in which that harm will arice.

The National Counterintelligence Policy Board

Iospectfully requests, thercfore, that these concerns be

bought to the attencion of the Board and chat the position

of the intelligence conmunity with respect to the disclosure

of intelligence asset identitied and intelligence sources and

incthods be considered in any subscquent review or final

determinations by the Board.

Respectfully yours,

Nora Slackin, Chairperson

National Counterincelligence

Policy Board
