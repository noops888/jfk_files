AMTURVY_ OPERATION

= 1. The AMTURVY Operation was designed for the
| purpose of conducting sabotage operations against Cuba.
re It consisted of a net of 13 AMTURVY assets whose primary

| function, apart from sabotage, was the preparation of
target studies and analysis of sabotage operations. The -
files contain only one reference to assassination, that
in 1963 and the continuation of the same plan through to
1965. Based on a review of the files, it is apparent
that the following assassination plan could have been known to
the Cubans, including the overall purpose of the AMBURVY

Operation.

2.  ASSASSINATION.PLAN - AMTURVY-13.

AMTURVY-13 (Mario SALABARRIA) was closely F
acquainted with Fidel Castro as far back as 1947 and there is son
some indication that they both may have been involved in the
1947 plan to topple the Trujillo Government in the Pominican
Republic. However, in 1948, SALARARRIA was responsible for
the arrest of Fidel Castro, this due to the latters apitation
on behalf of one Emilio TRO. Salabarria was later sentenced
to 30 years in prison for having murdered TRO/. He remained .
in prison until 1961 when he appealed for parole to ove
Lionel SOTO Prieto (201-955332), As Salabarria had once r
----f-- saved Soto's life, the latter appealed the case to Raul
Castro, Salabarria was subsequently released from prison
in’ Februgay, 1961, The terms of his release from jail
5 are unknown.

sought contact with AMTURVY - 1 Salabarria had known AMTIURVY-1's

brother, AMCONCERT-1 for twenty years and assumed that AMTURVY-1

was in touch with the AGENCY (how Ai assumed this is unknown).

At his first meeting with AMTURVY-1, in the summer of 1963, -

Salabarria said he was a member. of a group plotting Castro's

death, and needed money and weapons in order to carry out

the plan (AMCROAK-i was also a member of this group). In

return for this assistance, Salaharria offered t6é carry ovt

6. By early 1964, however, the Agency had become

dissatisfied with Salabarria and his proposed assassination
plan, and had notified the AMTURVY net (in particular
AMTURVY-1, AMTURVY-4, and’ AMCRBAK-1) to cease working on
the assassination idea. Salabarria's later attempt to
asSass inate Fidel Castro was not approved by the Agency,
and he was in fact informed of the Agency's opposition mf

to his plan.

7. COMMENTS

If as the file shows, the Agency approved
of Saiabarria's plan to assassinate Fidel Castro and provided
Saiabarria with the weapons (this in Octoher of 1963), Castro
Golild have been awaré of the plan, especially as Salabarria's
Gasé presents certain CI cotsiderations. Salabarria had been
released from jail following a personal apeal through Raul
Castro; and this when Fidel Castro was well aware of the
fact that Salabarria was responsible for the death of a
close friend, Emilio TRO; not to mention the fact that
Salabarria was responsible for Castro's arrest in 1948
What deal, if any, was made with Salabarria in return for
his release from jail is unknown. Nonetheless, ax Fidel
Castro has a recorded history of not being one to forgive,
especially when he has been affected personally as was the

case with Mario Salabarria.
