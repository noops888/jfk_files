Gambling Syndicate

The first seriously-pursued CIA plan to assassinate Castro tad
its inception in August 1960. It involved the use of members: of
the criminal undervorld with contacts inside Cuba. ‘he operation
had two phases: the. first ran from August 1960 unttl late April.
or early May 1961, vhen St vas called off following the Bay of Pigss
the second ran from April 1962 uitil February 1963 and was merely

a revival of the first phase which bad been inactive since about

May 1961.
Gambling Syndicate - Phase 1

claims that there was'a studied avoidance of the term in his
conversation with Bissell. Bissell recalls that the idea originated
with J. ¢. King, then Chief of WH Division, although King now
recalls having had only limited knowledge of such a plan and ata

much later date~-about mid~1962.

Edwards consulted Robert A. Maheu, a private. investigator whd
had done sensitive work for the Agency, to see if Maheu had any

underworld contacts. Maheu was once a special agent of the FBI. |

‘He -opened.a.private office in Washington in 1956. The late Robert.

Cunningham, of the Office of Security (and also a former Special
Agent, with the FRI), knew Maheu and.imew that his business was having
a shaky start financially. Cunningham arranged. to subsidize Maheu
to the extent of $500 per month. Within six months Maheu was doing
s0.well financielly that he suggested that the retainer be discontinued.
Over the years he has been intimately involved in providing support
for some of the Agency's more sensitive operations. He has since
moved his personal headquarters to Los Angeles but retains a
Washington office. A more detailed account of Maheu's background
appears in a separate. section of this report.
(Comment: Although we see nothing sinister in it, we are
struck by the fact that so many of the persons whose names appear,
im this account once worked for the FBI. We have already named
Cunningham and Maheu. Later to appear are William Harvey, James

O'Connell, and Edward Morgan.)

Maheu acknowledged that he had a contact who might furnish

access to the criminal underworld, but Maheu vas most reluctant to

allow himself to be involved.in such an assignment. He agreed to

a

participate only after being pressed by Edvarts to do so. Maheu
identified his contact as one Johnny Roselli, who lived in Los
Angeles: and had the concession for the ice-making machines on "the
strip” in Las Vegas and whom Maheu understood tobe a'member of the
syndicate. Maheu was mown to Roselli as a.man who hada number of
large business onganizations as clients. Edwards and Maheu agreed
that Maheu would, approach Roselli as the representative of business-
men with interests in Guba vio saw the elimination of Castro.as the
essential first step to the recovery of their investments. Maheu
vas authorized to. tell Roselli, that his "clients" vere willing to

pay $150,000 for Castro's removal.

September 1960

Shef Edwards named as his case officer for the operation
James P.. O'Connell (a former Special Agent; of the FBI), then Chief,
Operational Support Division, Office of Security. O'Connell and

Maheu met Roselli. 4 New York City on 1+ September 1960 where Maheu

made the pitch. ~ Roselli initially was also reluctant to become

involved, but finally agreed to imtroduce Maheu to."Sam Gold" who
either had or could arrange contacts with syndicate elements in Cuba
who might. handle the job. Roselli said he had no interest in being

paid for his participation and believed: that "Gold" would feel the

Bao

same way. A memorendum for’ the record prepared by Sheffield Edwards
on 14 May 1962" states: "No monies were ever paid to-Roselli and
Giancana. Maheu was paid part of his expense money during the periods

that he was in Miam: (Giancana is "Gold.").

O'Connell was introduced (in true name) to Roselli.as an employee.
‘of Maheu, the explanation being that O/Connell would handle the
case ‘for Mahieu, because Maheu was too busy to work on it full time
himself. No one else in the Office of Security was made witting of
the operation at this time. Edwards himself did not meet Roselli
until the sumer of 1962.

At this point, about the second half of September, She? Edvards
told Bissell that he hada friend, a private investigator, who had
a contact who in ‘turn had other contacts through whom syndicate
elements in Cuba could be reached. “These syndicate elements in

Cuba would be willing to take on such an operation. As of the latter

part of September 1960, Edwards, O'Connell, and Bissell were the only

ones in the Agency who knew of a plan against Castro involving U.S.

gangster elements. Edwards states that Richard Helms was not informed

of the plan, because Cuba was being handled by Bissell at that time.
With Bissell present, Edwards briefed the Director (Allen Dulles)
and the DDCI (General Cabell) on the existence of a plan involving

members of the syndicate. The discussion wes circumspect; Edwards



14-00000

deliberately avoided the use of any “bad vords." The descriptive’ tem
used vas “an intelligence operation.” Edwards is quite sure that the
DCI and the DDCI clearly understood the nature of the operation he
vas discussing. He recalls describing the chanel as ‘being "from A to
BtoC." As he then envisioned it, "A" was Meheu,;. "B" was Roselli, °
end "C" was the principal in Cuba. Edwards recalls that Mr. Dulles
merely nodded, presumably in understanding and approval. Certainly,
there was-no opposition. Edvanis states that, vhile there: was no
formal approval as such, he felt that he clearly bad tacit approval
to use his om judgment.’ Bissell committed $150,000 for the support -
of the operation.

(Coment': Tn the Light of this description of the briefing,
it 1s appropriate to conjecture as to just whet the Director aia
approve. “It is safe te conclude, given the men participating
and the general. subject of the meeting, that there was-little
tensa of. misunterstanding--even though the details were
deliterately: blurred and, the specific intended result was never
stated fn ummistekable language. It is also reasonable to
conclude that. the pointed avoidance of "bad words" emphasized

to the participants the extreme sensitivity of the operation.)

During the veek of 25 September 1960, O'Connell and Maheu: went to

Miami where Roselli introduced only Maheu to "Sam Gold" at a meeting

-18-



14-00000

in tae Fontainbleau Hotel. "Gola" said he had a man, whom he
identified only as "Joe," who would, serve as courier. to’ Cuba and

make arrangements there. Maheu pointed out "Gold" to 0*ConnelL

from a distance, but O'Connell never met either "Gold" or "Joe."

He aia, however, learn their true identities. An Office of Security ©
memorandum to the-DDCI of 24 June 1966 places the time as "several
weeks later:" O'Connell is now uncertain as to whether it was on this
firet visit to Miami or on a. subsequent one that he and Maheu learned
the true identities of the two men. Mahe and O'Connell were staying
at separate hotels. Maheu phoned O'Connell one Sunday morning and
called his attention to. the Parade supplement in one of that morning's
Miami newspapefs. It carried an article on the Cosa Nostra, with -
pictures of prominent members. ‘The man Maheu and O'Connell knew as
"Sam Gold” appeared.as Mom Salvatore (Sam) Giancana, a Chicago-based
gangster. "Joe, the courier" (who was never identified to either
Maheu or O'Connell in any other way) turned out to be Santos ‘Trafficante,
the Cosa Nostra chieftain in Cuba.

At that time the gambling casinos were still operating in Cuba,
and Trafficante was making regular trips between Miami and Havana on
syndicate business. (The casinos were closed and gambling was banned
effective 7 January 1959. On 13 January 1959, Castro announced that

the casinos would be permitted to reopen for tourists and foreigners



14-00000

but that Cubans would be barred. ‘The cabinet on 17 February 1959
authorized reopening the casinos for the tourist trade. Time magazine
for 2 March 1959 announced that the casinos had been reopened the:
previous week. ‘The New York Times issue of 30 September 1961 :
announced that the last of the casinos still running had been closed.)
Trafficante was to make the arrangements with one of his contacts

inside Cuba .on one of his trips’ta Havana.

Fall and Early Winter 1960

Very early in the operation, well-before the first contact with
Roselli, the machinery for readying the means of assassination was
set in motion. The sequence of events is not clear, but it is
apparent that a number of methods were considered. Preparation of
some materials went ahead without express approval.

(Comment: It should be noted that TSD maintains a stock
of equipment and materials for operational use. When queries are
nade of TSD technicians. about materials or devices that are not
stock items, it is not unusual for the technicians to go
ahead with the preparation of the materials or devices against
the event that there is a formal request for.them. Because of
this, ‘undue significance should not be attached to advance

preparations for this operation. It should also be noted that

states that the pill fora was

| chosen because of ease and. safety of handling.

“The gangsters may have had same influence on the

choice of a bans. of assassination. O'Connell says that in his
very early discussions with the gangsters (or, more precisely,
Maheu's discussions with them)’ consideration was given to possible
ways of accomplishing the mission. Apparently the Agency-had first
thought in terms of a typical, gangland-style killing in which

Castro would be gunned down. Giancane wes flatly opposed to the



14-00000

use of fiveamms. He sald that no one could be recruited to do
the Job; because the chance of survival and escape would be
negligible. Giancana stated a preference for a lethal pill

‘that could be put into Castro's food or drink. ‘rafficante
("Joe, the courier") was in touch with a disaffected Cuban
official with access to Castro and presumably of a sort that
would enable him to surreptitiously poison Castro. The gangsters
named their man inside as Juan Orta who was then Office Chief
and Direcvor General of the Office of the Prime Minister (Castro).
The gangsters said that Orta had once been in a position to
receive kickbacks from the gambling interests, had since lost
that pons of income, and needed the money.) .
When Eévards received the pills he dropped one into a glass of

water to test it for solubility and found. that it did not even

. @isintegrate, let alone dissolve. [took them back and made

up a new batch that met the requirement for solubility. Edwards
at that point wanted assurance that the pills were truly lethal. He
called on Dr. Guna to make an independent test of then. Edvards gave

Gunn money to buy guinea pigs as test animals. Gunn has a record of a

conversation witl{ on 6 February 1961. It may have related to

the ‘tests, but we cannot be sure. What appears to have happened is that

Gunn tested the pills on the guinea pigs and found them ineffective.



14-00000

In eny event, O'Connell aid receive the pills, and he believes
there were six of. them. He recalls giving three to Roselli. Presumably 7
the other three were used in testing for solubility and effectiveness.
The. dates on which O'Connell received the pills and subsequently
passed them to Roselli. cannot be established. It would have been
sometime after Gunn's notation of 10 February 1961.

Gunn also has a record of being approached about the undertaking
by William K. Harvey (former special agent of the FBI) in February

in conection with a sensitive project Harvey was working on for

" Bissell. According to Gumn's notes, he briefed Harvey on the operation,

and Harvey instructed him to discuss techniques, but not targets,
with Gottlieb. ‘Gunn's notation on this point is not in accord with ©
the recollectiom of any of the others involved. We are unable to
clarify it; the note may have been in another context. O'Connell
states that J. C. King was also briefed at this time, although King

denies learning of the operation until much later.

. Late February - March 1961

Roselli passed the pills to Trafficante. Roselli reported to
O'Connell that the pills had been delivered to Orta in Cuba. Orta
is understood to have kept the pills for a couple of weeks-before

returning them. According to the gangsters, Orta got cold feet.

(Comment: Orta lost his position in the Prime Minister's
Office on 26 January 1961, while planning for the operation was
still going on in Miemi and in Washington. He took refuge in
the Venezuelan Embassy, on 11 April 1961 and became the responsi-
bility of the Mexican Embassy when Venemela broke relations :
with Cuba. in November 1961. Castro refused to give him a safe
conduct. pass until October 1964 whem he was allowed. to leave for
Mexico City. He arrived in Miami in early February 1965.

(It appears that Edwards and O'Connell did not know at the
time of Orta's fall from favor. They have made no reference
to it--ascribing Orta's failure to cold feet. It would seem,
though, “that the gangsters did know that Orta had already lost -his
access to Castro. They described him as a man who had once had
@ position that alloved him a rake-off on gambling profits, a
position that he had sincé lost. ‘the only job with which we can

associate Orta that might have alloved him a rake-off was the
one he held in the Prime Minister's Office, which he. lost on
26 Jamary 1961. It seems likely that, while the Agency thought
the gangsters hada men in Cuba with easy access to Castro, what

they actually had was a man disgruntled at having lost access.)

The previcusly-mentioned 24 June 1966 summary of the operation

prepared by the Office of Security states that wien Orta asked out

of the assignment he suggested another candidate who made several
attempts without success. Neither Edwards nor O'Connell know the
identity of Orta's replacement nor any.additional details of the

reported further attempts.

March - April 1961.

Following the: collapse of the Orta ckamnel, Roselli told
O'Connell ‘that Trafficante knew of a man high up in the.Cuban exile
movement who might do the job. He identified him as Tony, Varona
(pr. Manuel Antonio’ de VARONA y Loredo). Varona was the head of the
Democratic Revolutionary Front, a group supported by the Agency as
part of the lerger Cuban operation. O'Connell understood that Varond
was dissatisfied with the nature and the extent of this support and
that JMAVE suspected that Varona was not keeping his bargain with the
Agency. i
(Comment: Reports from the FBI suggest how Trafficante may
have known of Varona. On 21 December 1960 the Bureau forvandea
to the Agency's menorentim reporting that efforts vere being
made by U.S. racketeers to finance anti-Castro activities in
hopes of securing the gambling, prostitution, and dope monopolies
in Cuba in the event Castro was overthrow. A later report of

18 January 1961 associates Varona with those schemes. Varona

approval: became invalid if Noss were not used within six

months of the date of the approval.)

‘Trafficante approached Varona and told him that he had clients
who oe to do away with Castro and that they would pay big money
for the job. Varona is reported to have been very receptive, since
it would mean that he would be able to buy his own ships, arms, and
communications equipment.

(Comment: By this time Roselli had become certain that.

O'Connell was an Agency employee, not a subordinate of Maheu.

He told O'Connell that he was sure that O'Connell was "a

government man - CIA" but that O'Connell should not confirm

this to him. Roselli said that as a loyal American he would

do whatever he could and would never divulge the operation.)

Roselli was to deliver money to Varona for expenses. O'Connell
now recalls the amount as $50,000. Edwards, who was away at the time,

get approval from Bawaras' deputy, Robert Bannerman, who until then
had been unwitting of the operation. O'Connell told Bannerman thet
the operation was known to and approved by Edwards. Bennerman authorized
passing the money and now recalls the amount as being on the order of

$20,00¢ to $25,000. An Office of Security memorandum to the DDCI,

of just how it was planned to get the poisoa into Castro's food
by employing someone with access to a restaurant frequented by
Castro. The mechanics were identical with those described by
Edvards and as reported in our earlier accomt of phase one of
the operation.
e. O'ConnelL's account of his own role in the operation.
in the early weeks following Harvey's: supposed takeover makes it
evident that there was not a clean break between the Office of
Security's responsibility and that of Harvey. Further, O'Connell
now believes that there must have teen "something going on”
between April 1961 (after the Bay of Pigs) and April 1962, but
he claims to be unable to remember any of the particulars. .
There are other disagreements among the three on facts. They are
reviewed here, not because they alter the essential fact of the
turnover or of Harvey's sole responsibility for the operation after
a certain point in time, but because they suggest that persons who

vere supposedly unwitting of events after the tumover were in fact

“witting, because they were not effectively cut off at the instant of

turnover.
Harvey's notes show that he and O'Connell went to New York City
to meet Roselli on the 8th and 9th of April.1962. O'Connell recalis

it as being early in April and that the introduction was made on a

in the original cast of hoodlum players. Harvey specified that
Giancana was not to be brought in on the reactivation of the operation,
and he believes that Roselli honored the: request. Roselli once :
reported to Harvey that Giancana had asked if anything was going on,
and’ when Roselli said that nothing was happening, Giancana. said,

"Too bad." Additionally, Santos Trafficante ("Joe, the courier” fron
the earlier phase) was no longer involved. With the closing of the
last casino in Havana, in September 1961, Trafficante presumably no
longer had access. Roselli now had a man known to Harvey as Maceo,
who also used the names Garcia-Gouez and Godoy.

(Comment: .Harvey is unable further to identify Maceo; he

describes ‘him as “a Cuban who spoke Italian." One of Varona'’s
associates in the Cuban extle comunity was named Antonio MACEO™
Mackle, but it seems unlikely that he was the Maceo of ‘this
operation. He was prominent enough in the exile comnmity to
have been known to Harvey. Further, it seems clear that Maceo
was. "Roselli! san." This second phase appears to lack the ,
overwhelming, high-level gangster flavor that characterized the
first phase. Roselli remained as a prominent figure in the
operation, but working directly with the Cuban exile community
and directly on behalf of. CIA. Roselli was essential to the

second phase as a contact with Varona, who presumably still

and take over the government. It quickly became clear that he was
referring to Cubela. Garcia-Bango said that he had always been
publicly identified as.a close friend of. Cubela, whom he last saw
in Havana on 9 March. Garcia~Bango said that he bad been the lawyer

18 January 1961, suggests that was one of those receiving

that support, although this was not confirmed. As a matter of
interest, as late as 10 June 1964 there was a report that gangster
elements in the Miami area were offering $150,000 for anyone who
would kill Castro (an’ amount mentioned to the syndicate repre-
sentatives’ by CIA case officers at an earlier date). These bits

of information, fitted together, could provide the basis for an
explanation of why was so readily available when approached

by Roselli. It also may throw Tight on a question noted in the

1967 IG Report. The operation with the syndicate had been called

off following the Bay of Pigs in April 1967; yet, when it was
reactivated in April 1962 the case officer felt there was something
already ongoing in spite of the fact that the operation had been
terminated a year earlier. It is possible that CIA simply found itself
involved in providing additional resources for independent operations
that the syndicate already had under way. The criminal syndicate

had important interests in Cuba, and to recover them may well have
Sought on its own to eliminate Castro. In a sense CIA may have been
piggy-backing on the syndicate and’ in addition to its material contri-

butions was also supplying an aura of official sanction.
