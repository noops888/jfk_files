Gambling Syndicate

The first seriously-pursued CIA plan to assassinate Castro had

Its inception In August 1960. It involved the use of nembers of

the criminal underworld with contacts Inside Cuba. The operation

had. two phases: the flist ran from August 1960 unttl late April

or early May 1961, when it was called off following the Bay of Pigs;

the second ran fron April 1962 until February 1963 and was merely

a revival of the first phase which had been inactive since about

May 1961.

Gambling Syndicate - Phase I

August 1960

Richard Bissell, Deputy Director for Plans, asked Sheffield

Edwards, Director of Security, if Edwards could establish contact

with the U.S. gambling syndicate that vas active in Cuba. The

objective clearly was the assassination of Castro although Edwards

claims that there was a studied avoidance of the term in his

conversation with Bissell. BIssell recalls that the idea originated

with J. C. King, then Chief of Wi Division, although King now

recalls having had only limited knowledge of such a plan and at a

â€¢ much. later date-about mid-1962.

Edvards consulted Robert A. Maheu, a private investigator who

had done sensitive work for the Agency, to see

it Maheu had any

underworld contacts. Maheu was once a special agent of the FBI.

He opened a private office in Washington in 1956. The late Robert

Cunningham, of the Office of Security (and also a former Special

Agent, with the FBI, knew Maheu and knew that his business was having

a shaky start financally. Cunningham arranged to subsidize Maheu

to the extent of $500 per month. Within six months Maheu was doing

so well financielly that he suggested that the retainer be discontinued.

Over the years he has been intimately involved in providing support

for some of the Agency's more sensitive operations. He has since

moved his personal headquarters to Los Angeles but retains a

Washington office. A more detailed account of Maheu's background

appears In a separate section of this report.

(Conment: Although we see nothing sinister in it, we are

struck by the fact that so many of the persons whose names appear

In this account once worked for the FBI. We have already named

Cunningham and Maheu. Later to appear are William Harvey, James

O'Connell, and Edward Morgan.)

Maheu acknowledged that he had a contact who might furnish

access to the criminal underworld, but Maheu was most reluctant to

allow himself to be involved. in such

an assignment. He agreed to

participate only after being pressed by Edwaras to do so. Maheu

identified his contact as one Johnny. Rosell, who lived in Los

Angeles:

and had the concession for the Ice-making machtnes on

"the

strip" 1n las Vegas and whom Maheu understood to be a member of the

syndicate. Maheu was known to Roselli as a man who had a humber of

large business organizations as clients. Edwards and Maheu agreed

that Maheu would approach Roselli as the representative of business

men with interests in Cuba who saw the elimination of Castro as the

essential. first step to the recovery of their Investments. . Maheu

was authorized to tell Rosellf that his "clients" were willing to

pay $150,000 for Castro's removal.

same way.. A memorandum for the record prepared by Sheffield Edwards

on 14 May 1962 states: "No monies were ever paid to Roselli

and

Giancana. Maheu was paid part of his expense money during the periods

that be was in Mamt." (Giancana is "Gold.")

O'Connell was introduced (in true name) to Roselli as an employee.

of Maheu, the explanation being that O'Connell would handle the

case for Mabeu, because Maneu was too busy to work on it full time

himsell. No one else in the Office of Security was made witting of

the operation at this time. Edwards himself did not meet Roselli

until the summer of 1962.

At this point, about the second half of September, Shef Edwards

told Bissell that he had a friend, a private investigator, who had

a contact who in turn had other contacts through whom syndicate

elements in Cuba could be reached. These syndicate elements in

Cuba would be willing to take on such an operation.

As of the latter

part of September 1960, Edwards, O'Connell, and Bissell were the only

ones in the Agency who knew of a plan against Castro involving U.S.

gangster elements.

Edwards states that Richard Helms was not informed

of the plan, because Cuba was being handled by Bissell at that time.

With Bissell present, Edwards briefed the Director (Allen. Dulles)

and the DDCI (General Cabell) on the existence of a plan involving

members of the syndicate. The discussion was circumspect; Edwards

- 17 -

SECRET -EVES OMLY

## Page 5

deliberately avoided the use of any "bad words." The descriptive term

used was "an intelligence operation." Edwards is quite

sure that the

DCI and the DDCI clearly understood the nature of the operation he

was discussing. He recalls describing the channel as being "from A to

B to C.". As be then envisioned it, "A" was Maheu, "g" was Rosellf,

and. "C" was the principal in Cuba. Edwards recalls that Mr. Dulles

merely nodded, presumably in understanding and approval. Certainly,

there was no opposition.

Edwards states that, while there was no

formal approval as such, he felt that he clearly had tacit approval

to use his own judgment. Bissell comdtted $150,000 for the support

of the operation.

(Corment: In the light of this description of the briefing,

It 1s appropriate to conjecture as to just what the Director did

approve. It Is safe to conclude, given the men participating

and the general subject of the meting, that there was little

Likelthood of Ilsunderstanding--even though the details were

deliberately blurred and the specifle intended result was never

stated in mistakable language. It is also reasonable to

conclude that the pointed avoidance of "bad words" emphasized

to the participants the extreme sensitivity of the operation."

During the week of 25 September 1960, O'Conrell and Maheu went to

Miami where Roselli introduced only Maheu to "Sam Gold" at a meeting

in the Fontainbleau Fotel. "Gold" said he had a wan, whom he

identified only as "Joe," who would serve

as courier. to Cuba and

make arrangements there. Maheu pointed out "Gola" to O'Connell

from a distance, but O'Connell never net either "Gold" or "Joe."

He did, however, learn their true Identities: An Office of Security

memorandum to the DDCI of 24 June 1966 places the time as "several

weeks later." O'Connell is now uncertain as to whether it was on this

first visit to Miami or on a subsequent one that he and Maheu learned

the true identities of the two men. Maheu and O'Connell were staying

at separate hotels. Maheu phoned O'Connell one Sunday morning and

called his attention to the Parade supplement in one of that morning's

Miami newspapers. It carried an article on the Cosa Nostra, with

pictures of prominent members. The man Maheu and O'Connell knew as

"Sam Gold" appeared as Mom Salvatore (Sam) Giancana, a Chicago-based

gangster.

"Joe, the courier" (who was never identified to either

Maheu or O'Connell. in any other way) turned out to be Santos Trafficante,

the Cosa Nostra chieftain in Cuba.

At that time the gambling casinos were still operating in Cuba,.

and Trafficante was making regular trips between Miami and Havana. on

syndicate business. (The casinos were closed and gambling was banned

effective 7 January:1959. On 13 January 1959, Castro announced that

Fall and Early Winter 1960

Very early In the operation, well before the first contact with

Roselli, the machinery for readying the means of assassination was

set in motion. The sequence of events is not clear, but it is

apparent that a number of methods were considered. Preparation of

some materials wert ahead without express approval.

(Comment: It should be noted that TSD maintains a stock

of equipment and materials for operational use. When queries are

made of TSD technicians about naterials or devices that are not

stock items, it is not unusual for the technicians to go

ahead with the preparation of the materials or devices against

the event that there is a formal request for. them. Because of

this, undue significance should not be attached to advance

preparations for this operation. It should also be noted that

(Comments

The gangsters may have had some Influence on the

choice of a means of assassination. O'Comnell says that in his

very early discussions with the gangsters (or, more precisely,

Maheu's discussions with them) consideration was given to possible

ways of accomplishing the mission.. Apparently the Agency had first

thought in terms of a typical, gangland-style killing in which

Castro would be gunned down. Giancane was flatly opposed to the

use of firearms. He said that no one could be recruited to do

the job, because the chance of survival and escape would be

negligible. Giancana stated a preference for a lethal pill

that could be put into Castro's food or drink. Trafficante

("Joe, the courier") was in touch with a disaffected Cuban.

official with access to Castro and presumably of a sort that

would enable him to surreptitiously poison Castro. The gangsters

named their men inside as Juan Orta who was then Office Chief

and Director General of the Office of the Prime Minister (Castro).

The gangsters said that Orta had once been in a position to.

receive kickbacks from the gambling interests, had since lost

that source of income, and needed the money.)

took them back and made

up a new batch that met the requirement for solubility. Edwards

at that point wanted assurance that the pills were truly lethal. He

called on Dr. Gunn to make an independent test of them. Edwards gave

Gunn money to buy guinea pigs as test animals. Gunn has a record of a

conversation witb

_Jon 6 February 1961. It may have related to

the tests, but we cannot be sure. What appears to have happened is that

Gunn tested the pills on the guinea pigs and found them ineffective.

In any event, O'Connell did receive the pills, and he believes

there were sis of them. He recalls giving three to Roselli. Presumably

the other three were used in testing for solubility and effectiveness.

?

The dates on which O'Connell received the pills and subsequently.

passed them to Roselli cannot be established. It would have been

sometime after Gunn's notation of 10 February 1961.

Gunn also has a record of being approached about the undertaking

by Willian K. Harvey (former special agent of the fBI) in Tebruary

In connection with a sensitive project. Harvey was working on for

Bissell.. According to Gunn's notes, he briefed Harvey on the operation,

* and Harvey instructed him to discuss techniques, but not targets,

i with Gottlieb.

Gunn's notation on this point is not in accord with

the recollection of any of the others involved. We are unable to

clarify it; the note may have been in another context. O'Connell

states that J. C. King was also briefed at this time, although king

denies learning of the operation until much later.

Late February - March 1961

Rosell passed the pills to Trafficante. Roselli reported to

O'Connell that the pills had been delivered to Orta in Cuba. Orta

1s understood to have kept the pills for a couple of weeks- before

returning them. According to the gangsters, Orta got cold feet.

(It appears that Edwards and O'Connell did not know at the

to It- ascribing Orta's fallure to cold feet. It would seem,

though, "that the gangsters did know that Orta had already lost his

of the assignment he suggested another candidate who made several

attempts without success.

Neither Edwards nor O'Connell know the

identity of Orta's replacement nor any additional details of the

reported further attempts.

Marco - April 1961

Following the collapse of the Orta channel, Roselli told

O'Connell that Trafficante new of a man high up in the. Cuban exile

movement who might do the job. He identified him as Tony. Varona

(DI. Manuel Antonio de VARONA y Loredo). Varona was the head of. the

Democratic Revolutionary Front, a group supported by the Agency as

part of the larger Cuban operation.

O'Connell understood that Varona

was dissatisfled with the nature and the extent of this support and

that IMWAVE suspected that Varona was not keeping his bargain with the

Agency.

(Corment: Reports from the FBI suggest how Trafficante may

have known of

â€¢Varona. On 21 December 1960 the Bureau forwarded

to the Agency a memorandum reporting that efforts were being

made by U.S. racketeers to finance anti-Castro activities in

hopes of

securing the gambling, prostitution, and dope monopolies

in Cuba in the event Castro was overthrown. A later report of

18 January 1961 associates Varona with those schemes. Varona

approval became invalid if Moss were not used within six

months of the date of the approval.)

Trafficante approached Varona and told him that he had clients

who wanted to do away with Castro and that they would pay big money

for the job. Varona is reported to have been very receptive, since.

It would mean that he would be able to buy his own ships, arms, and

communications equiment.

(Comment: By this time Roselli had become certain that.

O'Connell was an Agency employee, not a subordinate of Maheu.:

He told O'Connell that he was sure that O'Connell was "a

government man - CIA" but that O'Connell should not confirm

this to him. Roselli said that as a loyal American he would

do whatever he could and would never divulge the operation.)

Rosell was to deliver money to Varona for expenses.

O'Connell

now recalls the amount as $50,000. Edwards, who was away at the time,

recalls It as $25,000. Since Edwards was absent, O'Connell had to

get approval from Edwards' deputy, Robert Bannerman, who until thea

had been wwitting of the operation. O'Connell told Bannerman that

the operation was known to and approved by Edwards. Bennerman authorized

passing the money and now recalls the amount as being on the order of

$20,00i to $25,000. An Office of Security memorandum to the DDCI,

of just how it was planred to get the poison into Castro's food

by employing, someone with access to a restaurant frequented by

Castro. The mechanics were identical with those described by

Edwards and as reported in our earlier account of phase one of

the operation.

c. O'Connell's account of his own role in the operation

in the early weeks following Harvey's supposed takeover makes it

evident that there was not a clean break between the Office of

Security's responsibility and that of Harvey. Further, O'Connell

now believes that there must have been "something going on"

between April 1961 (after the Bay of Pigs) and April 1962, but

he claims to be unable to remember any of the particulars.

There are other disagreements among the three on facts. They are

reviewed here, not because they alter the essential fact of the

turnover or of Harvey's sole responsibility. for the operation after

a certain point in time, but because they suggest that persons who

vere supposedly unwitting of events after the turnover were in fact

witting, because they were not effectively cut off at the instant of

turnover.

Harvey's notes show that he and O'Connell went to New York Clty

to meet Rosell! on the 8th and 9th of April 1962. O'Connell recalls

it as being early in April and that the introduction was made on a

in the original cast of hoodlum players. Harvey specified that

Giancana was not to be brought in on the reactivation of the operation,

and he believes that Roselli honored the request. Roselli once

reported to Harvey that Giancana had asked 11 anything was going on,

and when Roselli said that nothing was happening, Giancans said,

"Too bad." Additionally, Santos Trafficante ("Joe, the courier" from

the earlier phase) was no longer involved. With the closing of the

last casino in Havara in September 1961, Irafficante presumably no

longer had access. Roselli now had a man known to Harvey as Maceo,

who also used the names Garcia-Gomez and Godoy.

(Comment: Harvey is unable further to identify Maceo; he

describes him as "a Cuban who spoke Itallan."' One of Varona's

associates in the Cuban exile community was named Antonio MACEO

Mackle, but it seems unlikely that he was the Maceo of this

operation. He was prominent enough in the exile community to

have been known to Harvey. Further, It seems clear that Maceo

was "Rosell!'s man.". This second phase appears to lack the

overwhelming, high-level gangster flavor that characterized the

frst phase. Roselli remained as a prominent figure in the

operation, but working directly with the Cuban exile community

and directly on bebalf of CIA. Roselli was essential to the

second phase as a contact with Varons, who presumably still

18 January 1961, suggests that

was one of those receiving

that support, although this was not confirmed. As a matter of

interest, as late as 10 June 1964 there was a report that gangster

elements in the Miami area were offering $150,000 for anyone who

would kill Castro (an amount mentioned to the syndicate repre-

sentatives by CIA case officers at an earlier date). These bits

of information, fitted together, could provide the basis for an

explanation of why

was so readily available when approÃ¤ched

by Roselli. It also may throw light on a question noted in the

1967 IG Report. The operation with the syndicate had been called

off following the Bay of Pigs in April 196l; yet, when it was

reactivated in April 1962 the case officer felt there was

something

already ongoing in spite of the fact that the operation had been

terminated a year earlier. It is possible that CIA simply found itself

involved in providing additional resources for independent operations

that the syndicate already had under way. The criminal syndicate

had important interests in Cuba, and to recover them may well have

sought on its own to eliminate Castro. In a sense CIA may have been

piggy-backing on the syndicate and in addition to its material contri-

butions was also supplying an aura of official sanction.
