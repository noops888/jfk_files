SUBJECT: Cubana Flights

1. The Mexico Station surveillance of Cubana flights in

1963 consisted of a unilateral group (LIFIRE) and two separate

groups (LITEMPO and LIENVOY) handled

was a telephone tap operation against the Cuban Embassy and

provided transcripts of conversations with the Cubana Office

and the Mexican Airport Control Office.

I checked with Robert Feldmann who said he thought all of the

Cubana flights were passenger flights.

A review of the transcripts for

the Commercial Office of the Cuban Embassy for late 1963 indicates that they

were shipping large quantities of automobile parts, foods and medicines

from Mexico City to Havana by Cubana Airlines.

Statements to clients on

what day they could send cargo and packages by Cubana led me to the

conclusion that all the flights to Mexico City from Havana could carry

passengers but some of the flights out were basically cargo (with the

capability of also carrying a few passengers). From manifests, it appears

that Cubana made a flight from Havana to Mexico City and return every

other day.

22 and 25 November flights carried passengers.

The 27th November flight

carried 75 passengers to Mexico and returned with LOPEZ and it is believed

a plane load of cargo. (LITEMPO passenger list attached).
