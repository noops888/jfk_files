PQ. 92-226

leading up, to ‘his current position and activities in

racketeering matters, can be obtained from information relating
to the early activities of LA ROCCA, furnished t6 the Pittsburgh °
Office of the. FBI as follows:

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE NESSER advisea that he- had been.
>in the numbers writing activity since.abowt 1928 and is still
active in this regard. He said that most of Pittsburgh's
: present day "big racket men" once depended on him solely, for
protection purposes since he knew local and state police
figures and recalled that JOHN LA ROCCA was. one of these
racketeers. MESSER stated that LA ROCCA became. acquainted
with him in about 1941 or 1942 when LA ROCCA was handling all
the numbers activity in the East Liberty Section, of Pittsburgh
and had set himself up as a "little god." When LA ROCCA
became dissatisfied with his financial gains, he left- Pittsburgh
on a trip to Chicago to see friends about paste reel machines
with which he felt he could make more money. MESSER said
a paste reel was similar toa “one-armed bandit" with the
exception that a small-paper-wrapped mint was dispensed after
the coin was placed in the slot and the play was registered.
The Chicago manufacturer of this machine circumvented ‘the >
"strictly for gambling purposes" phmaseology in the law in
this. manner. :

While LA ROCCA was in Chicago, MESSER said he moved into

the East Liberty Section.and took‘ over the entire numbers
operation. . He. turned in his numbers returns to one, GEORGE
CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When LA ROCCA’ returned
to Pittsburgh he became angry with MESSER and his move

and had-someone drive a car over MESSER one night as he

was crossing a street. MESSER said when he was, discharged |
from the hospital he found out that his automobile had nuferous .
bullet holes in it. MESSER said that because he thought

he would make ‘money in the. East Liberty Section, he stayed

in the business of writing’ numbers and actually: forced LA ROCCA
out of the numbers business.

MESSER advised that in.about: 1943, he and LA ROCCA became ,

friendly and LA ROCCA invited him to share equally in the |
i ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which later

set up offices at 5746: Baum Boulevard, in Pittsburgh. _ MESSER

PG 92-226 oe :

recalled that, LA ROCCA was completely -bankrupt at that time
because of numbers setbacks but managed to raise enough money
to’ put up his share. MESSER said he personally’ traveled to,
Chicago to arrange for the purchase of machines to be distributed
by this company and had a verbal agreement with ART ROONEY

who allowed him to place these machines throughout. the East
Liberty, Homewood, ‘and Garfield Sections of Pittsburgh, where

_ ROONEY was not operating. © According to MESSER, RCONEY,who is |
the present owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, professional
football club, was the only man who could get paste reels
before LA ROGCA tried, and controlled the entire Pi Lttsburgh
vicinity in this regard. MESSER said that the Government
placed a $160 tax stamp on each machine andthe city of
Pittsburgh put a $50 tax stamp on each machine. He said that
other owners of the company, in addition to himself and LA
ROCCA,. were FRANK AMATO, BARNEY MC GINLEY, SAMUEL. MANNARINO,
and F, W. ZOGG, the latter from Chicago. a

.MESSER advised that the company was doing well finan¢ially ©
before’ Allegheny County authorities raided @stablishmerits
where the machines had -been placed and forced it out of
business. ‘He ‘recalled that, although each. of the six afore-
mentioned individuals owned an equal share in the company,
SAM MANNARINO and LA ROCCA seemed.to run everything and held >
meetings at which important subjects were discussed in Italian,
-which he did not.understand. He advised that he realized

that LA ROCCA was only using him for his proven protection
methods and MESSER did not mind as long as he got’ his cut

of the profits... He recalled that during 1946 or 1947, MIKE
GENOVESE came on the scene. He stated that: this individual
had been a pickup man for LA ROCCA in the East Liberty-Homewood
Section of Pittsburgh and was a tough kid \who, according

to MESSER, "was almost begging to go to jail." He said

LA ROCCA turned GENOVESE over to him and asked MESSER to "keep |
him clean" because he had- him in mind for future plans.

He recalled that FRANK’ VALENTI, who was present at the
Apalachin conference of hoodlums, and ANTONIO RIPEPI, a
Pittsburgh hoodlum, visited the offices:of the Coin Machine
Distributing Company regularly and always took orders from
MANNARINO and, LA ROCCA, He-said RIPEPI was a more important
racket man than VALENTI but that LA ROCCA seemed to be the

Key man in the Pittsburgh area.. He said he would place

‘Information Relating to Alleged Arrest of Adopted Son of /

LA _ROCCA for Violation of Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Code. ©

PG T-36, who requested that his identity remain confidential

and who has stated that he will not appear before any future
Federal or State proceedings, advised that during one vacation
weekend enjoyed in Pittsburgh by the adopted son of LA ROCCA,’

who is attending Valley Forge Military Academy at Wayne, Pa.,

he was arrested by the Pennsylvania State Police fer either
disorderly conduct or violation of the Pennsylwania Motor Vehicle
Code. He stated that he believes a trooper working out .of the .
Warrendale, Pa., barracks made the arrest after he observed young:
LA ROCCA driving along a highway near his home and throwing empty
beer. bottles out of the window while attaining high speed. He
said he understood LA ROCCA became incensed when he could not
change the charges and when a local Justice of the Peace

gave young LA ROCCA "the full treatment."

Corporal ANTHONY KALEITA, Pennsylvania State Police Barracks,
Warrendale, Pa., advised on April 14, 1961, that a review of his
records from January 1, 1961, to that time failed to reflect

any record of an individual named LA ROCCA for any violation
whatsoever. He suggested that this individual- may have been
arrested by another law enforcement agency and that the-lecal °
“Justices of the Peace in the Ingomar, Pao» wicinity be

contacted in this regard.
