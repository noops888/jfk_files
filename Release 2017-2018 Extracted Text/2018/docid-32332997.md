PG: 92-226

leading up. to his current position and activities in

racketeering matters, can be obtained from information relating

to the early, actlvities of lA ROCCA, furnished to the Pittsburgh

office of the FBI as follows:

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE MESSER advised that he had been

In the numbers

writing activity since about 1928 and Is still

He said that most of Pittsburgh's

"big racket men" once depended on him solely for

protection purposes since he knew local and state policé

figures and recalled that JOHN LA ROCCA was. one of these

racketeers. MESSER stated that LA ROCCA became acquainted.

with him In about 1941 or 1942 when LA ROCCA was handling all

the numbers activity. In the East Llberty section of Pittsburgh

and had set himself up as a "little god."

When LA ROCCA

became dissatisfied with his financial gains, he left Pittsburgh

on a trip to chicago to see friends about paste reel machines

with which he felt he could make more money MESSER said

a paste reel was similar to a

'"one-armed bandit"

with the

exception that a small paper-wrapped mint was dispensed after

the coin was placed in the slot and the play was registered.

The Chicago manufacturer of this machine circumvented the

"strictly for gambling purposes" phraseology in the law in

this manner.

While LA ROCCA was in Chicago, MESSER said he moved into

the East Libërty Section and took' over the entire numbers

operation.. He. turned in his numbers returns to one GEORGE

CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh..

When IA ROCCA returned

to-Pittsburgh he became angry with MESSER and his move

and had someone drive a car over MESSER one night as he

was crossing a street.

MESSER said when he was; discharged

from the hospital he found out that his automobile had numerous

bullet holes in it. MESSER said that because he thought

he would make money in the East Liberty Section, he stayed

in the business of writing numbers and actually forced LA ROCCA

out of the numbers business.

MESSER advised that in about 1943, he and LA ROCCA became

friendly and LA ROCCA Invited him

: to share equally in the

ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which later

set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard, in Pittsburgh. MESSER

PG 92-226

recalled that, LA ROCCA was completely bankrupt at that time

because of numbers setbacks but managed to raise enough money

to put up his share.

MESSER said he personally traveled to.

Chicago to arrange for the purchase of machines to be distributed

by this company

and had a verbal agreement with ART ROONEY

who allowed him to

place these machines throughout the East

Ilberty, Homewood, and Garfleld Sections of Pittsburgh where

ROONEY was not operating. According to MESSER, ROONEY, WhO Is

the present owner of the

PIttsburgh Steelers, professional

football'

club, was the only man who could get paste reels

before LA ROCCA tried, and controlled the entire Pittsburgh

vicinity In this regard. MESSER said that the Government

placed a $100 tax stamp on each mächine and the city of

Pittsburgh put a $50 tax stamp on each machine.

He said that

other owners of the company, in addition to himself and LA

ROCCA, were FRANK ANATO, BARNEY MC GINLEY, SAMUEL MANNARINO,

and F. W. ZOGG, the latter from Chicago.

MESSER advised

that the company was doing well financially

before Allegheny County authorities raided establishments

where the machines had been placed and forced It out of

business.

He "recalled that, although each of the six afore-

mentioned individuals owned

an

equal share In the company,

SAM MANNARINO and LA ROCCA seemed to run everything and held

meetings at which important

subjects

were discussed In Italian,

which he did not understand.

He advised that he realized

that LA ROCCA was only using him for his proven protection

methods and MESSER did not mind as long as he got his cut

iy using, him

of the profits. He recalled that during 1946 or 1947, MIKE

GENOVESE came on the scene. He stated that this individual

had been a pickup man for LA ROCCA in the East Liberty-Homewood

Section of Pittsburgh and was a tough kid

to MESSER,

was almost besting to go to jallo according

He said

LA ROCCA turned GENOVESE over to him and asked MESSER to "keer

him clean" because he had him in mind for future plans.

He recalled that FRANK VALENTI

who was present at the

Apalachin conference of hoodlums, and ANTONIO RIPEPI, a

Pittsburgh hoodlum, visited the offices of the Coin Machine

Distributing Company regularly and always took orders from

MANNARINO and LA ROCCA:

He said RIPEPI was a more important

racket man than VALENTI but that LA ROCCA seemed to be the

key man in the Pittsburgh area.: He said he would place
