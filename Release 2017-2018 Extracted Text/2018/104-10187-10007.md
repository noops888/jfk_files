1, BACKGROUND :

The LIEMPTY Project ts designed to collect operational Infor-
mation on the LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well as targeis of
opportunity, through stationary and mobile photographic coverage, In addition,
the project provides the means for investigating leads from both the above
noted coverages and other Stattou sources,
through the renting of Safchouses, providing and servicing post office Lox matt
drops, conducting countersurvclllances and pretext investigations and perfoc~

related tasks,

2, OPERATIONS

LIEMPTY provides the majority of photographs used Ly the
Station In its CE operations against the LIMERICK target. In this phase of

the operation the LIEMPTY basehouses and photo truck produced approximately
140 rolls of operational photos In support of the Station's-CE program during
the reporting period, The Station considers the photo coverage of the
LIMERICK installation as essential tool in following the dally activities of the
personnel of that installation, including known and suspected Intelligence

officers, and individuals visiting the

Selected examples of the LIEMPTY contribution to the Station's
CE program and its support of other Station operations are as follows:

a, The support provided by the two LIEMPTY cutouts,
Oliver G, SCANTILING and Raymond H, GERENDE, in the AMROD
operation was essential to this operailon,

operation has been unique, ‘The cutouts provided professional level
countersuryeHlance during the actual mectings between AMRIPT- 1
and Oliver E, FORTSON (ps), passed letters to the LIERODE Instal-
lation, wrote many Ietters and placed aumerous phone calls in support
of this operation and have actually carried on the daily activity of the

operation,

b, In the Soviet area the actavitics under this project have beca
many and varied, Examples of thls are: Stake out of a mecting be-
tween a Sovict Intelligence officer and LISTEED-1; reporting of LiICALL|
on the agitation of Aleksandr SIDOROV, Sovict Military Aitache and
known intelligence officer, following a Station provocation of him;
LIENTRAP coverage of Lorenzo CARDENAS Barrajas, a Soviet contact;
a stake out of a bowling alley popular with PBPRIME citizens and offictals|
living in México to determine the extent of a Soviet intelligence officer's
attempts to cultivate these Individuals; and LIMITED's radio dispatching,
of the LIEMBRACE team when this team was assigned to surveillance of

LIMERICK targets, -

d. In the Station's continuing attempt to provide greater coverag
of the outlying states of Mexico, GERENDE has been assigned to develop
contacts in Zacatecas and Aguascalicntes which can be activated into
operational agsets In future, GERENDE has already met with some
success in this arca, but due to his heavy workload in the operational
role assigned him in the Station's support mechanism, continued ex-
ploiration of these contacts probably wlll be a slow process,

e, LILYRIC reporting has been of great interest in a matter of
LAURICLE concern,

f, In the general support of other Station operations, tasks of
the cutouts continue as reported in reference, SCANTLING performs
as alternate cutout to LICASA-! in a sensitlve LAURICLE operatien,
The project cutouts service 18 P, O, Box drops used not only for Station
operations but also in support of Headquarters, JMWAVE, and other
S:ation requirements, The completion of a new 4,5 meter security
wall at the LIMERICK Insiallation was fully reported on by the LICALLA

basehousé operator,

g. Numerous investigations and miscellaneous assignments wer
conducted by the project agents, a sampling of these follows: an tnves-
tigation of a contact of the Cuban Consul in Merida, a casing of the site

On LARD#*1 had planned to use as a secluded retreat (including pictures),
og Support of the[DMHULK operation In arranging by telephone the contact
Og. between[DMHULK and a KUBARK staff officer, Investigation In
if Cuernavaca of the purchaser of the Alfred SPERN property located
there, and a report by LIEMPTY-13 of the support of former Mexican

urity wall recently ere
around the perimeter of the LIMERICK installation has reduced somewhat the
area of coverage of the LICALLA base, Certain interior arrangements have
been made, such as ratsing the floor of the operating room at LICALLA, whic!
will allow continued operation of the base, However, if some sort of vegeratioy
grows over the wire strands at the top of the fence, the view of the base will
be shut off completely and other arrangements for photo coverage of the
LICALLA area of responsibility will have to be made,

ENT

No new equipment was purchased during the reporting perlod
nor ts any such purchase presently, planned, All assigned equipment functloned
normally during this perlod,

5. PERSONNEL

No change in personel assignments, recruitments or termin-
ations was experienced during the reporting period, The performance of all
personnel in the project continued to be completely satisfactory during this
period, The support rendered by SCANTLING and GERENDE io the AMROD
operation deserves particular mention and thelr superlor performance tn that
operation was noted in paragraph 2a above,

In recognition of his continued good all round performance the
Station recently requested that GERENDE's contract be amended to provide
for an increase in annual salary from $US 5, 500 i9 $US 6,000, ‘This raise is
not only desired, & ts considered necessary to offset the continued inflationary]
tread of the Mexican economy,

6, TRAINING

continued review of tradecratt principles was conducted during thls period,
Photographic product continues to be reviewed daily and the action agents are
instructed as necessary in order to improve or correct their technique In
both the taking and processing of this product,

7, PLANS

Since the Station considers that this project is operating at its
optimum size, tt does nor plan to expand it at the present time, Efforts will
continue to refine and better utilize the existing operational mechaniom,
