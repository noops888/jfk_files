Source advised during the period September 3-6, 1963,{
that JOHNXDIOGUARDI is presently employed by Consumer Kosher
Provisions.’ He stated that at one time JIMMY DOYLE indicated (
¥ a dislike for JOj wv IO, claiming that JOHNNY DIO should have
done a lot of things'for him but never did them. DOYLE claimed.
that he had spent $20,000 on behalf of DIO while DIO was in
prison, Subsequently, DOYLE told the informant that JOHNNY DIO
and ABE GORDON were partners before DIO went to prison. While
DIO was in prison, GORDON worked on many Teamsters to get
Teamsters loans, commissions and never gave any of this mo v
to DIO or his family. He also incurred the wrath of WILPONSROLT, 27
his partner in Local 805. In addition to this, GORDON was’ ia
constantly reporting back information to HOFFA concerning the
activities of JORIS ROURKE in New York, while O'ROURKE and HOFFA
were carrying on a’Reud. DOYLE advised the informant, however,
that O'ROURKE and HOFFA are now on friendly terms and that HOFFA
recently met DIO in a New York hotel. DIO told HOFFA that he
never got anything from GORDON and that his parole would be up
in October, He said that HOFFA was under the impression that
GORDON was taking care of DIO while he was in jail. DOYIE told
the informant that it was his opinion that a deal has been made
between HOFFA and DIO and that in October when DIO's parole is
up, GORDON will be removed from Local 805.

DOYLE also told the source that he will be leaving for
Florida sometime this month and will reside at his home in
Florida. He stated he is going there to avoid a subpoena which
he feels he will be receiving in the near future. He said that
once in Florida, he will feign illness‘if he is subpoenaed. wp
v

Informant discussed with JI. YLE the possibilit
of obtaining mortgages from the Local 560° Pension Fund controlled
by AnyEHON SY FROVEZANO in Newark, New Jersey. DOYIE told him he
would discuss the matter with PETE DE FEO and PETE DE FEO will
try to get NUNZIO PROVENZANO, brother of ANTHONY PROVENZANO, to
sit down with him concerning mortgages.

This source is in extremely close contact with DOYLE
and although the above material may furnish investigative leads,
it is necessary that extreme caution be used in reporting any of
the above information. It is suggested that because of the
informant's relationship with PLUMERI, any of the above material
to be reported should be set out on the administrative pages.

On October 22, 1963, AUSA BAER, SDNY, requested
information as to the whereabouts of PLUMERI on March 28,
1963, to support allegations contained in the impending
IRS indictmant of PLUMERI. NY 3936-c, whose testimony
is not available, advised that his records reflect a meeting
with PLUMERI in NY at 10:30 a.m. that date, but the source
advised that he could not be certain that they met. The
informant further advised that on that date he flew to Florida,
and recalled that PLUMERI told him that if the people in
Florida he contacted did not believe he raxresented PLUMERI
that the informant should telephonically contact him in NY.
Based on the above, the source of the informant is confident
that PLUMERI was in NY all day on March 28, 1963. AUSA BAER
was advised that PLUMERI was in New York on the critical date,
but that the informant was not available to testify to this
fact.

On November 20, 1963, AUSA BAER advised that he had
learned that PLUMERI was possibly in Florida at the present
time, and, therefore, was violating the terms of his bail. He
requested that an attempt be made to determine if PLUMERI was
in fact out of New York City. Contact with NY 3936-cC on that
date reflected that PLUMERI is presently in Florida. AUSA BAER
was advised that the subject is presently in Florida, and he
advised that he sent a telegram to the subject's residence,

400 East 59th Street, New York City, ordering him to appear
on November 22, 1963, or forfeit his bail.

NY 3842-c advised that he has been in contact with
, RUBY YMIKOWER. It is noted that the information furnished by
JALKOWER is only available to the informant and any disclosure
V of the information would compromize NY 3842-c. It is further
noted that a PCI file has been opened on JALKOWER, and he is
being contacted by SA RICHARD A. ANDERSON. NY 3842-c advised
JALKOWER continues his close association with PLUMERI, and
advised that the subject is very worried over investigations
in his activities by various agencies.

JALKOWER advised the informant that the subject
squared a shylock debt years ago for him, and that he then
paid the subject back in installments. JALKOWER stated
that the debt has long been paid off, but that he has been
unable to break away from the subject.

The informant subsequently advised that JALKOWER has
been attempting to sell buttons at approximately 25% under
the manufacturers! cost price. The buttons are a standard
blouse-type button, which is in constant demand, and, there-
fore, over the years has established a firm price. The
informant advised that JALKOWER could only sell at this price
for two reasons. Either the buttons are stolen, or he is
anticipating a bankruptcy proceeding, and is attempting to
reduce inventory by cash sales. The informant will continue
to develop information in this regard.

Special Agents of the FBI conducted spot checks on
several dates throughout the period of this report in the
vicinity of the subject's residence, 400 East 59th Street,
New York City, subject's place of business, York Hotel,
488 Seventh Avenue, New York City, and in the surrounding
immediate vicinities throughout the garment district of
New York City; however, no activity was noted on the part
of the subject.
