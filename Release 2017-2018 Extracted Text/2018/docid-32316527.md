information as to the whereabouts of PLUMERI on March 28,

1963,

to support allegations contained in the impending

IRs indictmant of PLUMERI.

The

informant further advised that on that date he flew to Florida,

but that the informant was not available to testify to this

fact.

On November 20, 1963, AUSA BAER advised that he had

learned that PLUMERI was possibly in Florida at the present

time, and,

therefore, was violating the terms of his bail. He

requested

that an attempt be made to determine if PLUMERI was

in fact out of New York City. Contact with NY 3936-C on that

date reflected that PLUMERI is presently in Florida. AUSA BAER

was advised that the subject is presently in Florida, and he

advised that he sent a telegram to the subject's residence,

400 East 59th Street, New York City, ordering him to appear

on November 22, 1963, or forfeit his bail.

The buttons are a standard

blouse-type button, which is in constant demand, and, there-
