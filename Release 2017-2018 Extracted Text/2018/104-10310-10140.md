The article does not make clear whether or not

NAGELL is back in Germany at the moment, nor do we have any

information regarding his present whereabouts, other than

the statement in the article that he is probably now in the

United States. • The Public Safety Officer/USBER advises us,

however that subsequent to his release from prison in East

Germany in October 1968 he again visited West Berlin and con-

tacted the Public Safety Office where he complained about

not being able to locate his children..

There are noll

Base traces on the author of

Thomas C. LUCEY.

Since the article appears to

any traces which Headquarters or the

may have.
