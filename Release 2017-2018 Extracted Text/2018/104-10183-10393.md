Details of. Neeting

3. The following information on the various topics as
indicated concern basically those requirements which have
been intended for, and levied on, ASLASH-1. However, due to
the fact that AMMHIP-1 was together in Europe with AMLASH~1,
AMWHIP-2:\was: debriefed oa the requirements on the outside
chance that he-might hdve some complimentary information on them.

aving met him in Havana. (ANWHIP-1 stated that AMLASH-1
claimed that fe (AMWHIP-i) had in fact met] “hunmber

rememberthe man.) He stated that any additional information

in exchange for ‘this he vaunted to get, his wife, two children,
and his mother~in-lawato the United States along with himself.
AMWHIP-1 stated that QUHOPS' Plan in brief was to accept

d. “Venezuelan” Returning from Moscow. Regarding the
Venezuelan who has reportedly to have Just come from Moscow
and returning to Cuba, AMWHIP-1 stated that he had no
information to contribute about the man. He did say, however,
that one time duringphis recent trip to the Cuban Embassy
Paris talking with QUNSNAFU-19, the Ambassador had interrupted
their conversation in order to talk to two men {about 30-35
years old). AMNHIP-1 met them briefly and was told by one
of them that they were from Oriente Province. AMWHIP—1
Stated that he could tell immediately by their accents
that they were not Cuban. In order to confirm this he
asked them where in Oriente they were from because one of the
Cuban officials in Paris was from Oriente and always wanted
fo chat with any people from Oriente who passed through Paris.
After a brief stumbling exercise, groping for a name of a
city in Oriente, the "Cuban" confessed that they were not
Cubans but Venezuelans. AMWHIP did not have suffident time
to learn more about them.a2The two Venezuelans spent about
thirty minutes talking with CUNSNAFU-19 while AMWHIP was there,
He did not know how much longer previous to this thirty
minutes that the Venezuelans had been in thev’embassy or to whom
else they talked. AMWHIP-1 suggested that (UNSNAFU-9 might
be able to obtain the names of the two Venezuelans in question.

AMLASH-1 stated that he had been unable, due tO°WUNSNAFU-19's
busy schedule, to get the latter down to the Gaslight Club
and enrolled as a member. AMWHIP stated, however. that he
could do the job just as well by taking out a gift menbership
for AFU-19zthrough the Gaslight Club in New York City.
and sending @SSNAFU-19's membership card and key to him in
Paris. We encouraged AMWHIP-1 to do this and to keep us
advised of his progress.

j. AMLASH-1's Accommodation Address Arrangement:
AMKHIP-1 stated that he had reviewed accommodation sses
with AMLASH-1 and had given appropriate instructions to
AMWHIP-2 in the event of the receipt of letters from
Havana signed by AMLASH-1 or signed by a "Cuban" whom
AMWHIP-2 did not know: (Comment: it was a good thing we
reviewed accommodation addiess with ANWHIP-1, see below.)
For the record AMLASH-1 will address his letters to. AMWHIP-2
either in care of his business address in Rome which is:

Cavaliere Hilto:
Jewelry Shop
Mente Mario
Roma

or to AMWHIP-2's business address in.Geneva (which incidentally
is identical with Bis home address, as AMWHIP-2 operates in
Geneva from his apartment): Rue Crespin, Gen i

(It should be noted that AMWHIP-2 intends to open a proper
office in Geneva in-the near future. However, this is no
particular reason for changing the accommodation address in
Geneva.) AMWHIP~1 stated that he had given the undersigned's
postoffice box in Washington (William A. Thompson, P.O.

Box 7224 Apex Station, Washington, D.C. to AMWHIP-2, believing
that this would expedite our receipt of letters from AMLASH-1.
AMWHIP-1 was told that his concern for rapid transmittal of
the letters was certainly appreciated, but that for security
sake, it was much better that they be forwarded in a cover
envelope to. AMWHIP’s address in New York City, -preferably,

his business address. AMWHIP was also told to remind
AMWHIP-2 that he'should handle the letters he received from
Havana as little as possible and put them:in cover envelopes
and send them as quickly as possible to AMWHIP-1 in New York
City. In this connection it remains the problem of obtaining
these letters on a expeditious basis when AMWHIP-1 is, for
example, out of town for a prolonged absence. It is
suggested that William Thompson's accommodation business

in Washington be given to AMWHIP’s father so that he may
forward AMWHIP-2's Tetters to Washington without undue delay.
(This is an excellent example of a breakdown in compartmentation

in Cuban operations.) ’

k, Paris Embassy Personnel. According to a telephone

call on 18 February from AMLASH-I in Paris, AMWHIPS] stated
that AMLASH-1 had said that (USS\AFU-8 and, perhaps GNBNAFU-9
would. be out of jobs in the ned future in accordance with
z,the present economy drive by the Cubans. AMLASH stated that
O'(USSNAFU-8 most certainly would be ousted, while QUNSNAFU-9's,
case was more uncertain, ym

He also stated that le believed these factories were for

concerning the silver, according to ASWHIP-1, that 30% had.
been reduced to bullion and that the rest consisted of “worked") |,
silver-article: antiques, .ar' easures,.- jewelry, «
AMWHIP stated ‘that this entire offering of silver 5.
had eventually been sold on the spot in Havana for cash: tO
an unknown person.of Turkisb/Italian background. AMWHIP
‘tried to find out the identity of the person but neither
oT-CUNSNAFU-19,. In on, nor..Iglesias, by phoné,” woul
reveal the identity. of the buyer. AMWHIP-1 offered to
or ask: Iglesias. for. thé name; but we cautioned against’
as showing undue interest in the matter. I
that if he, ever saw Iglesias in. person and could safely ask -
him he should do so together with any details ‘he. could » cegi
obtain about the transaction, ‘as it was related to Cuban _-
financial problems. AMWHIP-1 stated that on his return to

stated that ANBIDDY had told. ANLASH of at least some portion of
his: connections with the Americans. AMWHIP-1 stated that he had

made this statement. AMWHIP also stated, as he had-done ia. _

he felt that he could produce ‘more information and better serve
