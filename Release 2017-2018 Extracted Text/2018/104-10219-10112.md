1, The sttachment was passed to us by SMACT/1. SMABET prefers
to make their inquiry tarough us ip order to hold down the possibility
of a news leak regarding ¥illian Martin's potential trip to SHADD.

The last thing the SHADDs want is for this item to hit the papers.
SMACT/1 says the foreign sinister would prefer that no visit take
place. Until the latter learns rore definitively from LNILARP authori-
ties whether or not Kartin would be subject to extradition be will
reply to questions should the zroposed visit be leaked - that he
bas “no information, Meanwhile he would appreciate receiving LNHARP
opinion as to Martin's current status in law.

2. Please advise.
