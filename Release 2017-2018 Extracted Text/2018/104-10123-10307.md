CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

COMMUNICATIONS INTELLIGENCE INDOCTRINATION

I have read Section 790, Title 10, United States Code, which specifically -

refers to the subject of Comminications IntelligenceÂ®

I am aware that there

are special regulations of the Central Intelligence Agency entitled "Communi-

cations Intelligence." I acknowledge that is is my responsibility to inform

myself of the contents of those regulations as they pertain to performance of

my duties. I appreciate that the preservation of Communications Intelligence

source is of the utmost importance to the United States and that the loss of

such sources would be irreparable.

I have been informed that pursuant to law and as amplified by Agency regula=

tlons, I am not to discuss with or disclose to any person any Information

relating directly or indirectly to Communications Intelligence unless such

person is currently authorized to discuss or receive such information or

material of the particular category involved. By regulation I am aware that

the responsibility of ascertaining that such an authorization for another

person is valid and current, and that it is of appropriate scope, rests with

ne. I am aware further that if a change in my assignment or status renders

It no longer necessary for me to receive Communications Intelligence, my name

will be removed from the list of persons authorized to receive such material.

I hereby affirm my understanding that no change in my assignment or employment,

Including termination, will ever release me of my obligation under the oath

signed below.

OATH OF SECRECY

I do solemnly swear that I will not discuss with or disclose to any person,

regardless of his official position or status, any Information relating

directly or indirectly to Communications Intelligence, any Information de

rived therefrom, or the nature of the sources of such intelligence, until I

have ascertained that such person has been authorized to discuss and handle

Communications Intelligence and that his authorization has not been revoked.
