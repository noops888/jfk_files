WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT - #52%42h (RICHARDS, Guy)

Reference file contains a transcript of the Barry FARBER Show over
Station WOR-AM, New York, on 3 May 1967 entitled "Journalists Discuss
CIA NAD Espicnage". RICHARDS was queried regarding his book on
GOLENIEYSXI and his views on the CIA. RICHARDS’ replies were critical
of the Agency. Quote RICHARDS: "Now, let's take a look, for example,
at the Central Intelligence Agency in the year 1967. If history were
ever to be made of the great American bureaucracy, I think it quite
correct to say that they would pause end psy homage to a remarkeble
fact, namely, that in the form of the Central Intelligence Agency, there
has suddenly been created end evolved a great idea, namely, the idea of

combining the FBI with Santa Claus with the British Bast India Company
with Barnum & Bailey and the Ringling Bros. Circus. And before ve

get lost in the derision that this implies, let's take pause on two
very positive possibilities. One, that this may not be such a bad
idea at that. It may take its form among the great diversions.”

WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT - #52hhoh (De BAGGIO, Thomas)

Thomes De BAGGIO, editor of the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, a newspaper
described as part of the Underground Press Syndicate, was brought to your
attention in May 1967 2 ana CIA employee, who resides in
the sare epartment house se BAGGIO and who was concerned about
meeting De BAGGIO because of the nature of the paper published by De
BAGGIO. OS conducted inquiries on De BAGGIO and furnished the results to
Mr. GOODWIN's office who had had a request from De BAGGIO to verify
GOLENTEWSEI's CIA employment. At the time De BAGGIO called GOODHIN's
office he mentioned he knew Herman KIMSEY but had not seen him recently.
GOODWIN's office gave De BAGGIO a "No comment" reply. Of interest is
Mr. SAYLE's memo for the record dtd 6 June 1967 in which he speculates
that Capital Hill editor for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, Charles BOISE,
may be identical to Carl BLOISE, new Washington correspondent for
the PEOPLE's WORLD and reputed stringer for SUNDAY RAMPARTS.

“CORT RETURN TO CIA

Also, of note is the fact that De BAGGIO appeared on the sane
Berry FARBER show as noted above for Guy RICHARDS.

SPECTRUM
OS indices are negative on SPECTRUM. (NOTE: Speculation would be

that SPECTRUM may be a new name for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT. This
could be verified.)

Mr. Herman Kimsey
Hotel Vivian

1723 "G" Street NW
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Kimsey:

On a recent trip to Washington, | and I
had the pleasure of discussing topics of mutual interest,
One of them was the Romanoff case and of course your name
was mentioned. e

It was | feeling that an article should be
written about Romanoff for Reader's Digest. But he
cautioned that no material could be included which would
put CIA in a bad light. He said this was what kept Guy
Richards’ book, IMPERIAL AGENT, from being condensed by
. the magazine. | said it was his belief that the
Digest would not sprint articles which were anti-government
in its view and any article which was critical of CIA was
seen to be anti-governmer.c by Digest editoz: He suggested

that with your backgrounc and contacts you -< be able
to aid me in tne preparat.on of such an art. zz the
extent of guzding me through the CiA-rough ...::e of the

case,

I have not yet begun the preparation of such an article.
I do not believe that | : had your permission in
offering your advice, I would appreciate your comments
on the idea.

As I have only talked with you briefly during the tie

that I edited and published the Washington INDEPTxS2iT-=

and wr:te several stories dealing with the Roma case--

perhap. it is not fair to ask any favors of you zc all, or

impinge on your valuable time with long letters requiring

lengthy replies, * But I wonder if you, with your intimate
knowledge of CIA functions, would care to comment on recent
disclosures made in RAMPARTS Magazine, These disclosures,

- which were much on my mind as well as: » deal
with Mr. Jim Garrison's investigation into the assassination



of President Kennedy, In particular I wonder if you would
comment on the disclosures dealing with CIA involvement in
the assassination as well as specifically the following
quote:
"et is fair to say that not much in the way of Caribbean
intrigue went on in those days without the CIA, or at
least CIA operatives having a finger in it, Thus the
allegations of Gary Underhill, a weapons expert and some-
times CIA ‘unperson' may be quite plausible,,., Immediately
after the assassination, a distraught Underhill told
friends that a semi-autonomous CLA clique which had been
profiteering in narcotics and gun-running was implicated
in the assassination, Several months later, Underhill
was found dead of a bullet wound in the head; although
police decided it was self-inflicted, the circumstances
indicated otherwise." :

The article, now on the newsstands, also retails a story
concerning a man presently in the Springfield, Mo., psyche
ward to the effect that GIA was in on the assassination,

“| realize that you are no longer connected with the agency

and any comment which you might make to me would be in
confidence, I am most interested in whether you have heard
similar rumors or can verify these stories or others, IL have
heard and seen documented stories dealing with former CIA .
employees who retired in the field only to go into lucrative
business relations within the countries of former assignment,

‘similar to the way certain Generals and Admirals.are absorbed ,

into large defense industries,..but nothing as wild as the

RAMPARTS disclosures dealing with illegal activities of payrolle
: i

employees.

Il appreciate greatly any help you might be able to give me
on the above, As I am seldom at the above phone number it is

by letter. That way I will be sure to get it and in all
probablity it will be most convenient for both of us,

i

probably best to send any communications you would care to make |
