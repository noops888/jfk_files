to expandthe indirect mailing capacity of AMSCROLL propaganda to Cuba,
Station JHWAVE has encouraged AMSCROLL to contact relatives and friends
an the various Latin American countries.for assistance in the mailing

reported Cuban screening and censorship of letters from the JKWAVE area,

independently by. AMSCROLL, that ie to say Station JMWAVE does not run
checks ‘on individuals contacted until and unless an agreement is

reached ‘bi Since it would be difficult for

security problems, we would suggest that you direct the recipient of

the letter mentioned in reference to decline on some appropriate pretext,

2, Your offer to arrange such assistance through one of the civic
action groups to which you have access. is much appreciated, but at this
point we would like to see whether AMSCROLL'’s unilateral efforts are
sufficient. If not, we might ask later if these facilities are still
available, :
