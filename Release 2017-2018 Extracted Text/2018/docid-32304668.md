cv 344-¢ stated that FRANK DE AUGUSTINI, Owner of the
Roman Gardens, Mayfield Road, section of Cleveland, is the second
in command in Cleveland under MILANO, He stated he did not
know FRANK BRANCATO well but he believed that he would be next
in command in the Calabrese group in Cleveland and under MILANO
and DE AUGUSTINI,

cv 344-¢ stated that there would be two distinct groups
in the organization in the Cleveland area or in Northeastern Ohio
and as far west as Toledo. He stated the set up is unusual in
that the Calabrese group is more highly respected than the Sicilian
group in the geographical area. He stated his opinion comes from
reactims to different arguments which have arisen and would have
later been settled by meetings. He stated the Sicilian group
operates its own enterprises and there is apparently a pact that
they and the Calabrese will not encroach on each other's enterprises,

In this geographical area, the Sicilian group inclues !
JANES” LICAVOLI, aka Jack White, Cleveland; "WHITEY" BESASE of : !
Toledo. undér LICAVOLI and ANGELO PERNA of Toledo under BESASE. He :

less in control in that city at present. He had supported the
right candidate in a local election there and was able to operate,

help and, therefore, LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALLE and ANTHONY DELSANTER
became his partners in a bookie and numbers operation.

: At Warren, Ohio, CV 344-C advised ANTHONY: DELSANTER
became "boss" of the area when.MIKE FARAH, a Syrian, was murdered
(6/10/61). The organization had put up with FARAH as long as he
had influence and had the politicians in his pocket. When.he
became. obstreperous and uncontrolable, the "organization" 'dumped"
him, “He also stated that CHARLES IMBURGIA, operator of. the
Sunrise Inn; East Market Street, Warren, Ohio, may now be affiliated
with the Sicilian grotip of LICAVOLI, but at one time several years
ago he was part of the Pittsburgh group headed by RIPEPI,

CV 92-748

At Akron, Ohio, the territory is controled by the
Sicilian- group operating in Toledo, Canton, Warren, and Youngstown,
Ohio. Cv 344-¢ advised that JAMES LA FATCH seemed to be the
represenative of LICAVOLI in that area together with his brother,
TONY, and would be under the diréct supervision of "WHITEY" BESASE
of Toledo and LICAVOLI in Cleveland, Ohio.

At Mansfield, Ohio}; CV 344-¢ advised TONY MOLLICA is
an "organization" representative and although a Calabrese, will
"hustle" with the Calabrese and Sicilian groups. Informant does
not consider him a power, but stated he is a member of the "organiza-
tion" and operates the Ritz Bar in Mansfield, Ohio.

At Youngstown, Ohio; the informant advised there are the
Same two groups in the "organization" as in Cleveland, Ohio. ‘The
Calabrese has’ someaction and the Sicilian group under LICAVOLI
have their own ventures. Both have réspect for oné another's
enterprises. The Calabresé in Youngstown are run by: DOMINIC MALLAMO
who 1s more orless the successor to PAUL ROMEO, brother of MIKE
ROMEO arid MALLAMO is close-to ANTHONY MILANO. in Cleveland. MALLAMO

“is in a semi-retired position, but exacts tribute from those under

him. Second in command, taking a more active part and soon to be

the leading réprésentative of the Calabrese, 18 JAMES. PRATO, aka

"two Gun Jimmy" of Poland, Ohio, who is a nephew of MALLAMO, The
informant stated when the barbut game moved to: Struthers, Ohio,

from Youngstown, Olio, following the death of ,VINCE DE NIRO (7/17/61),
they moved the game in thé property of thé CARABBIA brothers and

only put up with them since they controled the city administration

in Struthers, Ohio, to the extent they would be allowed to

operate without interference.

He stated that young MIKE ROMEO, the son of PAUL ROMEO,
Campbell, Ohio, has some influence there as pointed out previously,
and is very close to JOHN BRAZZANO, the son of GIANNA BRAZZANO,
deceased, who was involved in the VOLPE murders in Pittsburgh.

Regarding the Sicilian group of the. “organization” in
Youngstown, CV.344-¢ stated he could not say.1f VINCE J. DE NIRO,
bombing victim of 7/17/61, was a member of the “organization” or
not. He stated, however, that DE NIRO's murder caused great ~
concern among all members of the "organization." He stated that
of all the murders committed .in the Youngstown area, this was the
only murder where members of the "organization". made active efforts
to determine the persons responsible for Same.. He cited inquiry
made by JAMES PRATO, JAMES TRIPODI, Steubenville, and TONY RIPEPI

CV 92-748

of Pittsburgh as examples of "organization" members attempting to
determine his killer. He stated if DE NIRO was not a member, he
was a big source of income for the organization and had been
cooperative after having been "shaken down" by the "organization."

CV 344-¢ stated the "organization" made no inquiry of
him following the bombing murder of CAVALLARO and for his reason
he believed CAVALLARO was killed for Betting out of line. He stated
if he had been killed without the sanction of the "organization",
they would have inquired as to who was responsible for the killing
of one of their members. He “stated that in His opinion, CAVALLARO
had a portion of DE NIRO's operation and apparently tried to "hog"
the entire operation after his death.

Regarding JASPER "FATS" AIELLO, JR., aka, the informant
advised he is no longer held in high respect because he has "gotten
out of line" by bad publicity and ‘by engaging in armed robbery and
burglary. He stated that AIELLO had formerly been well thought of
and in Youngstown, he occupiéd about the same position at one time
as TONY DELSANTER occupies at present in Warren, He neted that
DELSANTER and AIELLO are still close associates.

: CV 344-¢ advised WILLIAM NAPLES, bombing murder victim
killed on 7/1/62, was killed because the "organization" learned
he was responsible for killing DE. NIRO, According to the information
he received, the NAPLES brothers were not part of either the
Calabrese or Sicilian groups and did not contribute to either and
especially Cleveland.

CV 344-c stated regarding the killing of DOMINIC MOIO,
Canton, Ohio, whosé body was found stuffed in the trunk of his
car at Canton, Ohio, on 9/3/63, the "organization" made no daquiry
about hisdéath or the parties responsible. ‘This again would mean
to him that MOIO "had gotten out of line.” “MOIO. had Somehow
obtained employment with the NAPLES brothers and unquestionably
"set up" BILLY NAPLES for his murder. CV 344-c stated MOTO may
have been eliminated when it was. learned through the newspapers
that he had-admitted to the FBI that he had driven BILLY NAPLES
to his "Joe Blow" car just before it blew up, killing him.

He gave the following example:

He stated about 1958, a Warren, Ohio, pimp named ‘BENJAMIN
PANDELLI, not considered a member of the"organization" because
of his means of livelihood which is frowned upon by the "organization",
backed a sheriff in his candidacy for the office at Mansfield, Ohio.
As a result of this back, he was allowed by the successful
eandidate to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield, Ohio. ‘The
sheriff was not backed by TONY MOLLICA, a member of the "organization"
at Mansfield, Ohio.

cv 344-c stated when MOLLICA noted that PANDELLI's
operation, was a money maker, he approached PANDELLI and told him
that ‘people in town were talking and Saying that he, MOLLZICA, was
responsible for the house being able to operate. He said it
was giving him a bad namé. cv 344-c advised PANDELLI realized that
MOLLICA was not ¢oncerhed about his bad name and that MOLLICA was |
attempting to move in and muscle him. When PANDBLLI was not ~ |
receptive to the attempts of MOLLICA, MOLLICA then sought the aia”
of MIKE ROMEO, Poland, Ohio, who approached PANDELLI with the same
Story. ROMEO told PANDELLI, according to CV 344-c, that he should
close down for a couple of months so that” things could be "cleared
up." ROMEO told PANDELLI that he was a friend of his father, :
GUISSIPPI PINDILLI. 'PANDELLI refused to close and CV 344-C advised
according to what PANDELLI later told him, he. wrote 4 letter explain-
ing the situation to his father in Buenos Aires... CV 344-c stated
PANDELLI then received a letter from his father which instructed
him to take this letter to ANTHONY MILANO, in Cleveland, which
apparently PANDELLI did. A little later PANDELLI receivéd a call
from "WHITEY" BESASE, Toledo, Ohio, who instructed him to appear
with MOLLICA at the home,of JIMMIE. LA FATCH in Akron, Ohio.

"CV 344-c advised PANDELLI refused fearing that he. would
be "dumpéd" en route or at the meeting. PANDELLI called ANTHONY
MILANO at Cleveland in. the, presence of MOLLICA and MILANO, talked
to MOLLICA at this. time. He told him he was instructing PANDELLI
to accompany him to the meeting but that if a "hair on the head of
PANDELLI" was harmed, he would see that the whole bunch was taken
care of.

CV 344=c stated PANDELLI went™to Akron, Ohio, with MOLLICA
for the meeting at JAMES LA FATCH'S home. There were about 20
persons present, After a dinner, all except PANDELLI, not a member,
retired to the basement where MOLLICA and MIKE ROMEO.were interrogated.

ev 92-748

CV 344-¢ advised he learned that MOLLICA lied and he
denied he had said what he had and ROMEO became infuriated and left.
Everyone else shook hands with PANDELLI and he was told he could
continue to "operate" and he waS not "out of line." In addition,
to the above mentioned, others present during this meeting were
LA FATCH, "WHITEY" BESASE, LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALLE, ANTHONY

‘ DELSANTER, FRANK BRANCATO™ and many strangers not known to CV B44-¢,

CV 344-¢ stated about tio weeks ldter, PANDELLI was
called to the Ritz Bar operated by MOLLICA by MIKE ROMEO. ROMEO
denounced MOLLICA as a "Iiar' in front of PANDELLI and then instructed
PANDELLI to relay what had happened to ANTHONY MILANO in Cleveland
and to tel] himi that all had been cleared up. cv 344-c stated
PANDELLI. advised; he did not go to MILANO with this-méssage, but
saw his subordinate, DE AUGUSTINI, at Cleveland who said he would
relay the message to MILANO. CV 344-c stated apparently MILANO
was not to be bothered with such minor details.

RE: STEUBENVILLE "ORGANIZATION"

cv 344-c stated JAMES TRIPODI fully controls the
Stéubénville, Ohio, area and exerts some influence into certain
Sections of West Virginia. He stated that if there is to be
anything done illegally in the Steubenville, Ohio, area it is
necessary to first clear With TRIPODI, otherwise the parties
are on their own.

cv 344-c stated that several years back an "organization"
member's restalrant known as the Baron Restaurant owned by COSMO
QUATRONE was held up by some armed robbers from the Cleveland area.
The group included DAVE TIBERZIO, THOMAS "LAUGHING TOMMY" RUDELICK,
VINCENT INNOCENZI and DOMINICK MAFRICI. The thieves had not checked
with TRIPODI and as a result, MAFRICI: although the. son-in-law of
FRANK DE AUGUSTINI, Cleveland member. was killed in Buffalo about
3/15/57, while~out on bond. INNOCENZI was shot several times and
found near Canton, Ohio, in the summer of 1960.
