CV. 344-C stated there are a couple of the VOLPE brothers

still residing in Pittsburgh, but he does not know them personally.

Cv 344-C stated he had known GUY VOLPE, who later died

of pneumonia at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and at

CV 344-0 stated that FRANK DE AUGUSTINI, Owner of the

Roman Gardens, Mayfield Road, section of Cleveland, is the second

in command in Cleveland under MILANO.

He stated he did not

know FRANK BRANCATO well but he believed that he would be next

In command in the Calabrese group in Cleveland and under MILANO

and DE AUGUSTINI.

Cv 344-C stated that there would be two distinct groups

in the organization in the Cleveland area or in Northeastern Ohio

and as far west as Toledo.

He stated

the set up is unusual in

that the Calabrese group is more highly respected than the Sicilian

group in the geographical area. He stated his opinion comes from

reactins to different arguments which have arisen and would have

He stated the Sicilian group

operates its own enterprises and there is apparently a pact that

they and the Calabrese will not encroach on each other's enterprises.

In this geographical area,

the sicilian group inclues

JAMES LICAVOLI,

aka Jack White, Cleveland; "WHITEY"

BESASE Of

Toledo under LICAVOLI and ANGELO PERNA of

Toledo under BESASE. He

stated they have enterprises operating in Toledo.

tive at Sandusky, Ohio, who has his sources of income there.

Informant stated PAT FERRUCCIO was the representative

for LICAVoLI for years, but lost out for some reason.

FERRUCCIO

still a member is not in good standing at present.

CV 344-0 stated

he has heard that a "BONES" BATTISTA of Canton, Ohio, 1s more or

less in control in that city at present. He had supported the

right candidate in a local election there and was able to operate,

but needed

a "bank roll" for his operation.

He sought outside

help and, therefore, LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALLE and ANTHONY DELSANTER

became his partners in a

bookie and numbers operation.

became obstreperous and uncontrolable, the "organization' "dumped"

him.

He also stated that CHARLES IMBURGIA, operator of the

Sunrise Inn, East Market Street, Warren, Ohio, may now be affiliated

with the Sicilian group of LICAVOLI, but at one time several years

ago he was part of the Pittsburgh group headed by RIPEPI.

Campbell, Ohio, has some influence there as pointed out previously,

and is very close to JOHN BRAZZANO, the sön Of GIANNA BRAZZANO,

deceased, who was involved in the VOLPE murders in Pittsburgh.

Regarding the Sicilian group of the "organization" in

Youngstown, CV. 344-C stated he could not say if VINCE J. DE NIRO,

bombing victim of 7/17/61, was a member of the "organization" or

nöt.

He stated, however,

that DE NIRO's murder caused great

concern among all members of the "organization."

He stated that

of all the murders committed in the Youngstown

area, this was the

only murder where members of the

"organization"

of Pittsburgh as examples of "organization" members attempting to

determine his killer.

He stated If DE NIRO was not a member, he

was a big source of income for the organization and had been

cooperative after having been "shaken down" by the

"organization."

CV 344-0 stated the "organization" made no inquiry of

him following the bombing murder of CAVALLARO and for his reason

he believed CAVALLARO was killed for getting out of line.

He stated

if he had been killed without the sanction of the "organization"

they would have inquired as to who was responsible for the killing

of one of their members.

He stated that in his opinion, CAVALLARO

had a portion of DE NIRO's operation and apparently tried to "hog"

the entire operation after his death.

Regarding JASPER "FATS" AIELLO, JR., aka, the informant

advised he is no longer held in high respect

because he has "gotten

out of line" by bad publicity and by engaging In armed robbery and

burglary. He stated that AIELLO had formerly been well thought of

He gave the following example:

he stated about 1950, a Warren, Ohio, pimp named BENJAMIN

PANDELLI, not considered a member of the "organization" because

of his means of livelihood which is frowned upon by the

"organization"

backed a sheriff in his candidacy for the office at Mansfield, Ohio.

As a result of this back, he was allowed by the successful

candidate to open a house of prostitution in Mansfield, Ohio.

The

sheriff was not backed by TONY MOLLICA, a member of the "organization"

at Mansfield, Ohio.

CV 344-C stated when MOLLICA noted that PANDELLI'S

operation, was a money maker, he approached PANDELLI and told him

that people in town

were talking and saying that he, monuisA,

responsible for the house being able to operate.

was

He said it

was giving him a bad name.

CV 344-0 advised PANDELLI realized that

MOLLICA was not concerned about

his bad name and that MOLLICA was

attempting to move in and muscle him.

When PANDELLI was not

receptive to the attempts of MOLLICA,

MOLLICA then sought the aid

Of MIKE ROMEO, Poland, Ohio, who approached PANDELLI with the same

story. ROMEO

told PANDELLI, according to CV 344-C, that he should

close down for a couple of months so that things could be "cleared

ROMEO told PANDELLI that he was a friend of his father,

GUISSIPPI PINDILLI.

PANDELLI refused to close and CV 344-0 advised

according to what PANDELLI later told him, he wrote a letter explain-

ing the situation to his father in Buenos Aires. CV 344-0 stated

PANDELLI then received a letter from his father which instructed

him to take this letter to ANTHONY MILANO, in Cleveland, which

apparently PANDELLI did. " A little later PANDELLI received a call

from "WHITEY" BESASE,

Toledo, Ohio, who instructed him to appear

with MOLLICA at the home of JIMMIE LA FATCH In Akron, 0n10.

CV 344-C advised PANDELLI refused fearing that he would

be "dumped" en route or at the meeting:

PANDELLI called ANTHONY

MILANO at Cleveland in the presence of MOLLICA and MILANO talked

to MOLLICA at this time.

He told him he was instructing PANDELLI

to accompany him to the meeting but that if a

"hair on the head of

PANDELLI" was harmed, he would see that the whole bunch was taken

care of.

CV 344-0 stated PANDELLI went to Akron, Ohio, wish MOLLICA

for the meeting at JAMES LA FATCH's home:

CV 92-748

CV 344-C advised he learned that MOLLICA lied and he

denied he had said what he had and ROMEO became infuriated and left.

Everyone else shook hands with PANDELLI and he was told he could

continue to "operate" and he was not "out of line." In addition,

to the above mentioned, others present during this meeting were

LA FATCH, "WHITEY" BESASE, LEO MOCERI, ERNIE LA SALTE, ANTHONY

DELSANTER, FRANK BRANCATO

and many strangers not known to Cy 344-c.

CV 344-0 stated about two weeks later, PANDELLI was

called to the Ritz Bar operated by MOLLICA by MIKE ROMEO.

ROMEO

denounced MOLLICA as a "liar" in front of PANDELLI and then instructed

PANDELLI to relay what had happened to ANTHONY MILANO In Cleveland

and to tell him that all had been cleared up. CV 344-c stated

PANDELLI advised he did not go to MILANO with this message, but

saw his subordinate, DE AUGUSTINI, at Cleveland who said he would

relay the message to MILANo.

CV 344-0 stated apparently MILANO

was not to be bothered with

such minor details.

RE: STEUBENVILLE "ORGANIZATION"

CV 344-0 stated JAMES TRIPODI fully controls the

Steubenville, Ohio, area and exerts some influence into certain

sections of West Virginia.

He stated that if there is to be

anything done Illegally in the Steubenville, Ohio, area 1t 1s

CV 344-C stated that several years back an "organization"

QUATRONE was held up by some armed robbers from the Cleveland area.

The group Included DAVE TIBERZIO, THOMAS "LAUGHING TOMMY" RUDELICK,

VINCENT INNOCENZI and DOMINICK MAFRICI.

The thieves had not checked

with TRIPODI and as a result, MAFRICI although the son-in-law of

FRANK DE AUGUSTINI, Cleveland member was killed in Buffalo about

3/15/57, while out on bond. INNOCENZI was shot several times and

found near Canton, Ohio, in the summer of 1960.
