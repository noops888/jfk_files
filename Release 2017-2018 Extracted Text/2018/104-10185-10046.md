TON RESUE QUIRENES

We are most apprecialtre al the effort represented by OiRA 27542,

and it appears from the contents that our purpose in having MAGONETTI contact

the Subjecs of the dupaich has been accorplished. I any further action in desired.

we shall inform you. Please convey our thanka to CLARISON and MAGONETTI

for a Job mell done.

To she Station comment al lao end of the dispatch: Te question coa-

cering the extent of tracing of potential agenta for thin KUTUBE/ D parpose has

been fully discussed at Headquarters, and the following policy has been establined:

Candidates will be traced is selecied U. S. files; tracing in foroign files will be

permited only when the foreiga indices concerned can be traced personaily by s

KUBAIK alailer who will be in a position lo certií, thas the foreiga service os

police does not know who was traced.

Tracing by a penetration agent is not uni-

lateral enough to fis this maximum sensitivity effort anco there la no acceptable

guarantee that a record a the tracing la nol left in foreiga files. Theoretically,

tracing subject of OIRA 27542 in ItaHan flus would be desirable; practically, we

emanor take the sligalens chance o exposing our interest in Sabjoct to a foreiga

corvice ard will therefore have to forego the additional tracing. For your infor.

mation, our tracing as Headquarters conniata of the following mininoum: RL RI

arChives, Greenliat, KUSCD^ files, Malian Branch files (and olber branches as

appropriate).

Please handle any future Iralfic pursuant to OIRA-27542 in accordance

wIth paragraph 5, OIFT 18582. The use of the RYBAI slug alone ain't what it
