“he We are most appreciative of the effort represented by OIRA 27542, -
and it appears from the coatents that our purpose in having MAGONETTI contact
the Subject of the dispatch has a accomplished. I any further action is destred,
be yore {nform you. Please convey our thanks to CLARKSON and MAGONETTI

ra i : :

a c the Station Comment at the end of the dispatch: The question con= -
corning the extent of tracing of potential agents for this KUTUBE/D purpose has
been fully discissed at Headquarters, and the following policy has beea extablished:
Candidates will be traced in selected U, S, files; tracing in foroiga files will be
permitted only when the foreign indices concerned can be traced personaily by a
KUBARK ataffer who will be in a position to certii, that the foreign service or
police dows not know who was traced. Tracing by @ penetration agent is not ani-
lateral enough to fit this maximum sensitivity effort ence there 1s no acceptable
Guarantee that & recard of the tracing {s not left in foraiga files. Theoretically,
tracing subject of CIRA 27542 in Jtalian fila would be desirable; practically, we
cannot take the slightest chance of exposing our.interest in Subjoct to a foreign
aervice ard will therefore have to forego the additional tracing. For your infor-
mation, our tracing at Headquarters consists of the following minimum: RL, Ri
archives, Greenlist, KUSCDA files, Italian Branch files {and other branches as
appropriate).

3. Please handie any future traffic pursuant to OIRA-27542 in accordance ‘|;
with paragraph 5, OIRW 18582. -The use of the RYBAT slug alone ain't what it
used to be.
