FL.

Concerning Item 1(b), whieh requested the first
investigative renort or LU disseminated by FBIHQ outside the
PSI in each case, and a list of recipients of that report or
LMU, the following should be noted. Regarding the incident
involving the proposed assassination of a narcotics agent, no
revort or LE was submitted by the Minneasolis Field Office as

there are notations which identify those agencies which recaived
copies of thease docu~sats.

‘L 5 UNCLASSIFIES , | PATE MEMBEI

CN athe

The following concerns an interview of Dr. Joseph _
William Magee, a former FBI SA who retired in 1965, by an SSC
Stakr Member.

On January 2, 1976, Usgee advised this Bureau that on
a Friday, about September 18, 1975, he was telephonically contacted
by a Mike Epstein of the SSC who indicated a desire te talk to
him career & Magee told Epstein that he was quite busy and
would not be able to see him immediately. The only information
Epstein gave as to the reason for wanting to interview Magee was
to get information about the early organization of the FBI
Laboratory, There followed some further telephone calls between
the two but they never got together for an interview at that time.
However, on December 29 or 30, 1975, Epstein again called Magee
and asked Magee to appear at the SSC office for interview on
January 6, 1976. The only information Epstein gave on this
occasion as the subject matter of the interview was that it
would be about the operations of the Bureau.

: On January 2, 1976, the Legal Counsel Division of this
Bureau determined from Epstein that the topic of interview of
Magee would be FBI Laboratory procedures and practices and, in
general, background information concerning FBI Laboratory operations,
On the same date Magee was advised by this Bureau of Epstein's
Assoc. Oe. advice concerning the subject matter of the interview.

U. S. Senate Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Res Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)
Joseph William Magee by an SSC Staff Member

Magee was released by this Bureau from his confidentiality
agreement for purposes of the interview.

On January 7, 1976, Magee voluntarily furnished this
Bureau the results of the interview which are as follows, not
necessarily in chronological order.

Interview took place on January 6, 1976, and Epstein
was the sole interrogator. The interview was very informal,
most of which took place in a coffee shop in the Dirksen Senate
Office Building, and it lasted little more than a half hour.
Magee was not advised of his rights. The foliowing subject
matters were covered. Epstein inquired as to whether the FBI
had had a drug program. Magee responded by asking if Epstein
meant 9 program relating to the use of truth serum and Epstein
responded in the affirmative. Magee told him that the FBI did
not have such a program but that during the 25 years he had
been with the Bureau, there may have been some very selected
occasions when truth serum may have been used, but that he had
mo specific knowledge of such use. Magee further advised that he
never knew of any FBI SA also being a medical doctor and that he
did not believe that an SA would ever have injected anyone with
a truth serum. Epstein voiced surprise that the FBI was not
aggressive enough to have a truth serum program in connection
with its use of the polygraph.

Epstein next inquired as to what the FBI did relative
to vulnerability studies. Magee told him that he did not know
what Epstein was talking about. Epstein elaborated by stating
that in the 1960s, Gentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) allegedly
conducted surveys such as spraying chemicals in a subway station
to see if it could be sabotaged in this manner. Magee answered
that he knew of no such type of activity by the FBI and did not
think the FBI would ever engage in such activity.

Ret Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)
Joseph William Magee by an SSC Staff Member

Epstein inquired concerning the relationship between
the FBI and CIA, Magee told him that he knew at one time the
FBI had one man who was the liaison link with CIA, that person
being former SA Sam Papich, Epstein wanted to know if meetings
between Papich and the CIA were primarily for the FBI's benefit. |
Magee responded that he did not know much about the liaison
arrangements and meetings but it was his belief that such meetings,
as may have been held between FBI and CIA personnel, were designed
for the mutual benefit of all parties and that he did not know of
any meetings which were designed solely for the FBI's benefit.

Epstein inquired as to what the FBI did relative to
certain gases, the exact type unrecalled by Magee in his report
on this interview. Magee responded that some FBI SAs possess
gas masks to be used for obvious reasons but that the FBI had no
programs for use of gas.

Epstein asked Magee what he knew about Martin Luther
King, Jr. and whether he, Magee, had ever heard any recordings
concerning King. Magee said that he had not but that he under-
stood that the FBI had recordings of King which were bona fide,
Magee then told Epstein of his recollection of an obscure news
story of an event in North Carolina a number of years ago when
it was developed that some of King’s associates had illegally sold
a number of rental automobiles and that the news account indicated
that no prosecution was authorized by the Department of Justice,
possibly on the basis that the Department of Justice did not
then want to disrupt the civil rights activities of King's
associates.

i Magee's report of the interview was telephonically =
furnished to Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE (SSC)

NOTE: SECRET

Samuel Adason Jaffe was a symbol number informant
of the New York Office from 1958 to 1961 and was later in
contact with the Washington Field Office, During these
periods of contact, Jaffe furnished information on his numerous
contacts with Soviet and People's Republic of China officials,
which were occasioned by his employment with ABC and CBS and
with other news media. 9 (4)

poLlowing his identification by Soviet defector
Fsanny") as having been recruited by the KGB while assigned
to Moscow, Jaffe was extensively interviewed and advised that
he believed he had been the subject of a recruitment approach
but denied being a KGB agent, Our_relations thereafter were
conducted with caution in view of Peay!" allegations and
he is not currently being contacted. (u)

Jaffe filed a request under the Freedom of Information
Act in March, 1975, and subsequently appealed our denial of
access to information concerning him as contained in our files,
Jafie has alleged that the FBI, or his association with the FBI,
has prevented him from obtaining work in the news media field.
This allegation is not supported by any material contained in
his file.w(u)

represents 211 information contained in Jaffe's main file,
with certain exceptions which are explained in the memorandun
to the Committee. There are also some 200 to 250 references

no annual reports were submitted. It is for this reason that

Regarding information pertaining to the Richmond,

Regarding information pertaining to the discovery of

no annual reports are being furnished as none were submitted by

_ Robert K. Kelly at Room G-308, Dirksen Senate Office Building,
Washington, D. C. He suggested we have lunch in the building

about the Committee's work and I was able to keep the conversation C
on a theme of my asking about his background and current activities<
He did ask if I knew Roy Moore. He was informed I knew Roy in i
Birmingham and that he was one of a very few “trouble shooting*
inspectors who traveled throughout the United States as agent in
charge of major case investigations. He asked my opinion on why

rally agents. TI explained the latter as Roy Moore being the type
boss for whom most agents enjoyed working. 7

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM SENATORS
MONDALE AND BAKER

On December 22, 1975, the FBI received a copy of a letter dated
i December 18, 1975, which Senators Mondale and Baker sent to the Attorney
General levying certain requirements on the FBI with a request that the
responses be provided the SSC during the last week of Neeember , 1975,
and the first week of January, 1976.

i

| Item 2 contained a request for any information refuting the

| suggestion made on page 34 of the General Accounting Office's September 24
report to the House Judiciary Committce, that cases in which violence can
be predicted probably represent less than two percent of all FBI domostic
intelligence investigations.

ry Page 34 of the September 24, 1975, report of the Comptrolier
NG General before the House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Constitutional
Rights concerning FBI domestic intelligence operations contains the following
statement: "There were only 12 instances--or less than 2 percent--in which
the FBI obtained advanced (sic) knowledge of planned activities on the part
7 of a subversive or extremist group or individual." This statement appears,
g both in form and content, to be somewhat different from that contained in

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

The FBI is very reluctant to draw any conclusions from these
General Accounting Office's statistics, and we maintain no records or
statistics which would either refute or substantiate the inferences which
you apparently draw from their interim report. The two percent may
represent hundreds of citizens' lives and thousands of dollars in potential
property damage. It may only represent one life ~ a policeman, a citizen,
perhaps a President or public official. How does one measure the value of
this type of information? Surely not solely in terms of percentages.

You should perhaps consider the base from which the General
Accounting Office apparently drew their statisties. Their interim report was based
on their review of 676 FBI domestic intelligence cases under investigation during
Calendar Year 1974, in ten varied U. S. cities. Over 50 percent of these 676 cases
were admittedly only preliminary inquiries. These were limited investigations
designed primarily to fully identify the subject through established sources
ond to ascertain whether that subject was in fact associated with an extremist
group or organization, or was likely to engage in violence himself. That
little advance information of planned violence evolved from these limited
investigations is not surprising. Most of the information concerning planned.
violence would normally come from well-esteblished informants in groups
and would not likely show up in these individual case files.

Also, had the General Accounting Office used as its base the
years of greater incidence of domestic violence, such as 1967-72, the figures
might have been appreciably different.

Item 3 was a request for any analyses of the General Accounting
Office's September 24, 1975, report.

The FBI has not prepared any analytical memoranda or any analyses
of the preliminary findings of the General Accounting Office as presented to the
House Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights on September 24, 1975.

RE: DECEMBER 18, 1975, LETTER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

FROM SENATORS MONDALE AND BAKER

The General Accounting Office report of September 24 was
an interim report hurriedly prepared to respond to a congressional request.
Neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice was afforded the opportunity
te review this report for substance or to have comments included prior to
its delivery to the Congressional Committee.

The General Accounting Office originally planned to submit
its final report in November or December, 1975; it is now expected in
Jenuary, 1976. The final General Accounting Office report will include
findings, conclusions, and recommendations based on a review of the full
900 domestic intelligence case sampling and 2 voluminous amount of
additional material, The FBI and the Department of Justice have been
assured of the right to review this report prior to its issuance and to have
eomments included where appropriate. Any FBI analyses will be conducted
after receipt of the General Accounting Office's final report.

Dear General Levi:

We have been asked to chair a special subcommittee i
of the Select Committee on Intelligence which will con- i
centrate on matters relating to domestic intelligence
activities of the Federal government. Our mandate is to
prepare for the full committee's consideration a draft
report of findings of fact on alleged abuses or excesses
by the FBI and other domestic intelligence agencies; the
causes of such alleged abuses or excesses and recommendations
which the Committee might make. to remedy the problems we
have uncovered.

sates

We are aware of the fine work in hh your staff has
been engaged in these areas and hove that they will be
available to work with the Conmittee staff on these matters.
However, the Subcommittee finds the Committee record needs
to be supplemented in several important respects and there-
fore finds it necessary to direct a number of requests to
g the FBI for further information which we hope will be
% treated on a priority. basis so that the Subccmmittee can
H meet thé deadlines set by the full committee. These and
g future requests which will be handled between the two
Ey committee counsel or Mr. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Leader,

and Mr. Shaheen, Special Counsel for intelligence Coor~
dination, will pertain to both information necessary for
{ us to formulate meaningful recommendations and to pursue
[

roars

matters on certain specific alleged abuses which remain
unsettled. Among the future requests will be questions
pertaining to your guidelines on “Domestic Security Inves-
tigations" and on manpower and budget statistics for the
FBI's domestic intelligence program.

proposal; 2) correspondence among GAO, House Judiciary Chairman
Peter W. Rodino, Jr., and Attorney General Levi, concerning GAO's
verification proposal; 3) a statement entitled, "FBI's Domestic Operations--
A Perspective," outlining the fundamental authority for FBI operations,
Bureau administrative structure and procedures, as well as statistical data
on security investigations between 1965 and 1975; and 4) a 33-page analysis
of the legal authority for FBI domestic intelligence operations.

GAO offered us an advance copy of Mr. Staats' testimony with the
lproviso that it would accept FBI suggestions and minor corrections but
‘would not make any substantive alterations in the draft. We have reviewed
the draft, and GAO has made some technical changes at our suggestion. —
From a substantive viewpoint, while we take exception to GAO's phraseology
in certain instances, as well as to certain factual conclusions and inferences,
lour overall reading of this material is that it represents an effort on ninadlid
part to present an objective picture of FBI operations.

congressional testimony on FBI domestic security intelligence investigations to
be delivered on Wednesday morning, 9/24/75, by Comptroller General Elmer B.
Staats.

'

Attached is draft copy of testimony prepared by GAO's staff for,
_delivery by Mr. Staats_oni Wednesday af 9/24/75. AS was the case
“with the draft of Mr. Staats! morning testimony, GAO has furnished this
document with the understanding that it would entertain suggestions for
minor corrections but would not make substantive alterations. We have been
informed that the attachment was prepared under an exceedingly short dead-
line. Hasty preparation is evident from our preliminary evaluation, and, :
although the draft is critical of certain aspects of our domestic security intel- :
ligence investigations, we do not consider this document to be an Rees
or incisive statement.

Nevertheless, the draft does raise issues which may be the

subject of follow-up inquiry, particularly with reference to investigative rs

sources and techniques. Under the subheading "Sources and Techniques
Used During an Investigation," on pages 8, 9, and 10, reference is made
to the use of school and telephone company employees as confidential sources,
access to postal and passport records, pretext interviews, COINTELPRO-type
activity, and surreptitious entries in cases reviewed by GAO. In addition,
reference is made at the bottom of page 9 to information derived from
electronic surveillance coverage which appeared in cases reviewed by
SGA. However, GAO's testimony fails to indicate that the information

. referred to was completely derived from overhears. Consequently,
the testimony may create an erroneous impression with respect to the
use of electronic surveillances in these cases. We are working with GAO f

Memorandum to Mr. W.. R. Wannall

Re: General ate Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations’
62~56866

In his afternoon testimony, Mr. Staats will make the following
observations and recommendations:

1. Few would deny the necessity for the FBI to conduct domestic
security intelligence investigations, but there should be clearer guidelines
governing their purpose and scope.

2. The Office of the Deputy Attorney General should be charged
with the responsibility for ensuring that the FBI complies with guidelines
which might be issued by the Attorney General rather than diffusing this -
responsibility among various divisions of the Department of Justice.

3. As suggested by the Rockefeller Commission, there should
be a mechanism created either in the FBI or in the Department of Justice to
evaluate and analyze the results of the FBI's domestic security intelligence
investigations. :

2 4. Although only 16 of the 676 cases reviewed by G.1O (3 percent)
were referred to a United States Attorney for prosecutive opinion, in 43 percent
of the cases (291), the FBI was able to establish that the subject was a leader
or a member of a subversive organization or was.prone te violence.

5. FBI field offices are not fully consistent in the manner in
which they conduct preliminary inquiries and frequently do not conclude
the inquiry within the allotted 90 days.

FBIHQ personnel are continuing to review the attachment, and
we anticipate consulting with GAO's staff on Monday morning, 9/22/75, to
discuss any changes deemed necessary.

On Wednesday, 9/24/75, Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats
testified in public session before the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and
Constitutional Rights of House Committee on the Judiciary. His testimony,
and that of several assisting GAO officials, was based on their preliminary
review of the FBI's domestic intelligence operations.

A copy of Mr. Staats' revised prepared testimony is attached. |

The Committee convened in Room 2141 of the House Office Building
(Rayburn Building) at 9:23 a.m. Mr. Staats read his prepared testimony and
answered some questions until approximately 12:25 p.m. The Committee

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations
62-56866

Verification

The Comptroller General read from his prepared testimony and was
interrupted occasionally for questions. The initial pertinent comments and-questions.
by Chairman Don Edwards were directed at eliciting a statement from Staats
that the denial of direct access to FBI files for the purpose of independent
verification was unique in GAO's audit history and that, because of this,

GAO was unable to completely assure Congress as to the accuracy of their
survey. GAO indicated they still felt that they had valid audit. They were
afforded the opportunity to interview FBI officials and case Agents and had

no reason to doubt the accuracy of the summaries. They were not impuning
the motives of the FBI or the Attorney General in denying access; they under-
stood the principle involved, but insisted that verification was necessary.
Mr. Edwards mentioned the House may subpoena the necessary FBI files to
permit verification. Mr. Fogel of GAO replied that GAO would prefer the

files on which summaries were prepared be shipped to FBI Headquarters
where the GAO could conduct their random verification proposal.

GAO.strenuously disagreed with Attorney General's opinion
that GAO's audit authority was limited to access for the purposes of conducting -
financial audits and Congressman Edwards was critical of the Attorney General's
failure to correspond with Congress subsequent to 6/25/75.

FBi-Prepared File Summaries

Mr. Staats stated that GAO's testimony and preliminary review
was based on 676 FBI case summaries in the Subversive and/or Extremist
field out of a projected 899 from 10 FBI field offices. In response to specific
‘questions from Mr. Drinan, he and Mr. Richard Fogel, GAO, indicated that
GAO had received more than the 676 summaries (they had received as of
9/24, 852 out of 899), but that in order to prepare for testimony, their analysis
was based on the 676. Drinan attempted to establish that the FBI was .. . a
delaying or dragging its feet in providing the other summaries. GAO 7
replied that most FBI field offices have been extremely cooperative in the
time-consuming job of preparing summaries. (GAO did not identify publicly
the FBI office which they did not consider completely cooperative--Springfield. !
Because of manpower limitations and other case demands on Springfield, this

office has completed only 68 out of a projected 90 summaries. Springfield has
indicated they will make every effort to complete all 90 summaries not later
than mid-October.)

“Legal Authority

GAO testified that the FBI did have legal authority to conduct domestic
intelligence investigations, but that this authority was in definite need of clarification,
as its basis is in some instances shrouded in ambiguity.

Miss Geraldine Rubar of the GAO Legal Office discussed with
precision the Presidential Directives, the 1936 Hoover memoranda and the
‘various statutes conferring authority. Mr. Drinan loudly stated his opinion
that the FBI was operating for forty years in this field without legal authority
and asked to be shown where the term "extremists" appeared in any Presidential
-| Directives or statutes. Miss Rubar replied that the term was not in vogue at the time
but that it was used by Attorney General Ramsey Clark in a 1967 memorandum to the
FBI when he ordered intensified investigation and coverage in the area of
black.nationalist groups .and-extremists .

’

Mr. Drinan repeatedly, but unsuccessfully , attempted to get
Miss Rubar to state the FBI had no investigative jurisdiction in the Subversive
and Extremist field even to the point of inquiring if even one of GAO's staff
attorneys had perhaps reached that minority opinion. Miss Rubar replied
that there was agreement among GAO's legal staff that the jurisdiction was
there but was in need of clarification and updating.

Initiating Investigations

Mr. Staats testified that, from GAO's reading of the FBI Manual, there
was a degree of vagueness as to the type and ayount of evidence needed to
open an FBI investigation in the Extremist and Subversive field. GAO
arbitrarily categorized cases into those opened on the basis of hard, i
medium or a soft degree of evidence and said 36 percent of the 676 cases mat
reviewed were opened on a "soft degree" of evidence. 7 rauus

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations
62-56866

Congressmen Dodd, Drinan and Badello expressed specific
interest in the "soft" area. In response to their queries, GAO Auditor Fogel
listed several instances where, based on summaries, GAO believed the
opening of preliminary inquiries by the FBI field offices was subject to
question. Among these were:

1. An instance where cases were opened on two individuals
on information provided the FBI by local police that two high school youths
were present in the courtroom at a trial of an extremist. (There was no
indication by GAO in their testimony as to whether the police had identified
these individuals as high school youths, or whether the preliminary inquiries
conducted by the FBI so identified them.)

2. An instance where the FBI opened a case on a husband and
wife on the basis of having seen their license plate outside the home of a
‘New Left functionary where a social party was in progress. (Again, there
was no indication by GAO in the testimony as to whether the FBI knew it was

a social party at the time the preliminaries were opened or determined this
«Subsequently .)

3. A case was opened on an individual who expressed an interest

in applying for membership in a group considered extremist or subversive by
the FBI.

4. A case was opened on an individual who telephoned a membe:
of an extremist group.

5. A case was opened on a person who parked his car outside a
convention of a subversive/extremist organization.

6. A case was opened as a result of a mail cover on an individual
who corresponded with a national officer of a black extremist organization.

: 7. A case was opened on an individual who attended a meeting of
the press committee of a subversive organization.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: General Accounting Office (GAO) Review of FBI Operations
. 62-56866

All of the above were enumerated as examples of FBI field office
exercising judgment and discretion in opening cases based on "soft" evidence.
Congressman Badillo took loud exception to this and said he saw no basis for
opening cases in any of these instances and referred to them as "no basis" cases

‘l rather than soft.

GAO advised they were not prepared to make a positive recommendation
on these cases (36 percent) at this time but, in their final report, they would
address this issue. GAO indicated it could be an area where the FBI might review
and more carefully define criteria.

Organi anizations

Congressman Drinan took exception to the use of terms in the

FBI Manuals, such as extremists and black and white hate groups. He stated _
these are basically people pursuing their goal of racial justice. He then asked
‘for GAO to list some of these organizations which the FBI characterized as
"Extremist." Mr. Fogel then named the following:

The Ku Klux Klan a

The Minuteman

The American Nazi Party

The Black Panther Party
ms The Nation of Islam

Mr. Drinan made no further comment on this subject.

Preliminary Inquiries i:

GAO pointed out that 73 percent of the preliminary inquiries
received went beyond the 90-day FBI Manual limitation and that in 68 percent
of these cases, FBIHQ was not advised and had no opportunity to review or
possibly terminate the investigation. Congressmen Dodd and Drinan claimed
the FBI was, therefore, not following its own rules. GAO offered no
explanations as to why field offices might go over the 90-day limit, such
as matters requiring special investigative effort and attention, such as the
bombing cases, Hearst case, Pine Ridge Indian case, which affected offices
under audit.

Programs, Sources and Techniques

GAO enumerated the programs, investigative aids, sources,
and the techniques utilized in FBI investigations. For the most part,
these elicited no abnormal interest, but it was apparent the Committee will
follow this subject in GAO’s final report and in the event any FBI officials. are-,
invited to testify, they will be subject to intensive questioning:on COINTELPRO >
surreptitious entry, and mail openings.

Regarding sources, Drinan critically referred to "the Army of
| informants" and wanted numbers and payment figures which GAO could not
supply. Drinan also expressed interest in Counterintelligence (Espionage)
Matters which GAO declined to discuss and stated it was not a part of their
mandate to review those matters.

Miscellaneous

The Committee inquired as to why the FBI was unable to.provide™™
-dhnone. precise-aceourting figures on time and resources devoted to specific.
areas. Mr. Staats advised that in his experience with other agencies ,..the
FBI's position was unusual; but that it was an organization which required
flexibility and SACs had to be able to shift resources on a short notice: *
He indicated there apparently had been no prior need in the FBI for the
modern management accounting system, but that one was now under development.

GAO witnesses followed the prepared text with respect to Depart-

7 mental guidance, Attorney General's guidelines, dissemination of information,
fe file maintenance and destruction, the Rockefeller Commission's recommendation
‘for the development of an analytical capability for domestic intelligence matters.

In the opinion of the writer, the tone of questions and statements
of Messrs. Drinan and Badillo were very ¢ritical of the FBI, and on occasion -
that of Mr. Dodd's. These Congressmen repeatedly attempted to put words
in the Comptroller General's mouth and to twist his statements to their own
liking. Basically, Mr. Staats and the GAO witnesses stuck to their prepared
“statement and their amplification was in basic support of this statement.

In particular, these critics attempted to get Mr. Staats to state
that, in view of the few statistics pointing toward prosecution and conviction.
that the FBI's investigative effort in the domestic intelligence field wds a waste
of taxpayers' money. Mr. Staats refused to so state and indicated that the cost
effectiveness of FBI coverage and penetration of subversive and extremist groups
was very difficult to.measure. He said one could not tell how much violence
was deterred by FBI coverage or-the knowledge on the part of subversives
and extremist leaders that their identities were known and activities were

: under FBI Sritende .

_ News media coverage diminished by more than half after the
Inoon recess. The writer overheard one media reporter state to a TV
technician they had the option of returning to cover the afternoon session,
ut they were not because "it was another Drinan circus."

‘The Committee thanked Mr. Staats and GAO for their "excellent"
report and indicated they anticipated receipt of the completed written report
in November, 1975.

TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to the testimony of FBI Director |
Clarence M. Kelley before the SSC on December 10, 1975. During
this testimony, certain questions arose on which answers were
deferred. Set forth hereinafter are the unanswered questions
along with the responses thereto.

Senater Howard H. Baker, Jr., inquired as to Director
Kelley's feeling concerning an Inspector General concept
extending Governmentwidé:. Senator Baker asked the Director to
think about the question and furnish his thoughts at a later
date. Upon reflection and consideration of the question,
Director Kelley has decided it would be inappropriate for him,
as Director of the FBI, to comment concerning the need for a
ear ba aeeaiaal General as it would affect any agency other
t the .

Senator Gary Hart stated that although higher
authorities had been alerted to the existence of Counterintel~
ligence Programs (COINTELPROS) in one or two instances, in
terms of the bulk of the Programs there was no systematic
information flowing upward through the chain o£ command to
former Director Hoover*s superiors. Specifically, Senator Hart
indicated the SSC had received testimony that the existence of
the COINTELPRO effort against the lew Left had not been made
known to higher authorities and asked if Director Kelley had
any information in this regard. Directer Kelley asked for an
apportunity to substantiate the notification provided by former 7
Director Hoover to higher authorities. : :

U. 8, Senate Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)°

While no systematic report was made on a regular basis
by former Director Hoover regarding COINTELPRO activities,
information regarding the COINTELPROS was periodically provided
to his superiors in the Executive and Legislative Branches. FBI
files contain considerable documentation clearly establishing
no effort was made by Director Hoover to conceal from superior
authorities the fact the FBI was engaged in neutralizing and
disruptive tactics against revolutionary and violence-prone
groups. This documentation is as follows:

1. Briefing of the President. On November 6, 1958,
Director Hoover presented to President Dwight Eisenhower and the
Cabinet an oral briefing entitled “Current Communist Subversion
and Espionage in the United States, 1958." Included in the
resentation material was a description of the Bureau's effort to
‘intensify any confusion and dissatisfaction among its (Communist
Party, USA) members." Use of informants was cited as a technique.
to further this goal. This particular effort was referred to as
one of several programs to counteract resurgence of Commmist
Party influence in the United States. In November, 1974, former
Assistant to the Director Cartha D. Deloach advised he recalled
very clearly briefing President Lyndon 8. Johnson regarding the
Bureau's activities against black militants.

2. Notification of White House. In 1958 a letter was.
sent to Presidential Aide Robért Cutlér at the White House
specifically advising that our COINTELPRO directed against the
Comminist Party had been initiated in August, 1956, and citing
examples of techniques utilized. In 1965,a letter was directed ,
to Presidential Aide Marvin Watson at the White House advising
him this Bureau was seizing every opportunity to disrupt the Klan.

"3, Notification of Secretary of State. In 1961,
a letter enclosing a memorandum setting forth examples of
COINTELPRO actions directed against the Communist Party was sent
to Secretary of State Dean Rusk,

NW 55132 DocId:32989570 Page 106
Bee Bb



U. S. Senate Select Committee
to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

4, Notification of Attorneys General. A letter was
directed to Attoxney General William togers Ta 1958 specifically
advising him our COINTELPRO had been initiated against the
Commimist Party in August, 1956, and citing examples of techniques
utilized. In 1961, a letter was directed to Attorney General
Robert Kennedy enclosing a memorandum citing examples of COINTELPRO
actions directed against the Commumist Party. In 1965, a letter
was sent to Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach advising him
the FBI was seizing every opportunity to disrupt the Ku Klux Klan.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark was furnished, in 1967, a letter which
enclosed a detailed memorandum outlining our efforts to neutralize
and disrupt the Ku Klux Klan. In September, 1969, Attorney
General john Mitchell was advised of our efforts to disrupt the
Klan. Additionally, former Assistant to the Director DeLoach
advised in November, 1974, he had briefed former Attorney General
Ramsey Clark regarding the various COINTELPROS and he also
expressed the opinion that former Assistant to the Director
Alan Hi. Belmont ox former Assistant to the Director William ¢c.
Sullivanhad briefed Attorney General Katzenbach.

5. Notification of Congress, Bureau files reveal that
detailed information cancerning the COINTELPROS was prepared for
off-the~record use by former Director Hoover in connection with
several appearances before the House Subcommittee on
Appropriations. Material concerning the COINTELPROS was prepared
for the Director's use in comnection with Appropriations testimony
for the fiscal years 1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1966 and 1967.
All this material was clearly marked for off-the-record discussion.
Published transcripts of hearings by the House Subcommittee on
Appropriations contain notations that on at least six occasions
between 1958 and 1966, off-the-record discussions took place at
those points in Mr. Hoover's prepared remarks dealing with the
COINTELPROS. Former Assistant to the Director John P. Mohr
advised in November, 1974, he recalled the Director on several
occasions had furnished details to the House Subcommittee on
Appropriations relating to FBI COINTELPROS. In November, 1974,
Assistant to the Director Nicholas P. Callahan advised he, too,
recalled several instances involving off-the~record discussion

by the Director with members of the House Subcommittee regarding
this Bureau's efforts to neutralize groups and organizations
ee and that there was no critical comment made in regard
thereto,

An FBI Headquarters supervisor who was assigned
responsibility for COINTELPRO matters during the period 1964
te 1967 recalls that on a number of occasions he was required
to prepare informal memoranda and summaries relating to COINTELPRO
actions, It was his understanding this material was to be
utilized by Director Hoover in connection with briefings of
various Government officials.

A review of FBL files has not located any document
indicating higher authority was formally advised of the existence
of the COINTELPRO effort directed against revolutionary New Left
elements. It should be pointed out the program that targeted
the New Left was only in existence during the period 1968 to
1971 (35 months) and only 285 actions were approved, which
xepresent approximately 12 percent of all actions approved in the
basic COINTELPROS. Additionally, during the time period of the
New Left program this Bureau was engaged in extensive reporting
and dissemination of information relating to activities and
violence perpetrated by revolutionary elements, including the
so~called New Left.

The Chairman, Senator Frank Church, inquired as to how
much time and money is béing spent by the FBI in conducting
investigations on possible Presidential appointments to Federal
offices, plus any other information which would indicate what.
proportion of the FBI's time and effort was absorbed in this kind
of activity. Senator Church also asked the Director te supply
the number of such investigations conducted each year beginning
with 1970 and also information as to what offices are now
covered by such investigations.

The FBI conducts investigations under the Federal
Employee Security Program pursuant to Executive Orders 10450
and 10422, Executive Order 10450 became effective May 28, 1953,
end sets forth security requirements for employment in the
Executive Branch, The purpose of the Federal Employee Security
Program is to insure that the employment and retention in
employment of any civilian in the Executive Branch is clearly
consistent with the interests of the national security.

At the request of tha White House, investigations are
conducted concerning Presidential appointees and White House
personnel, At the request of Cabinet officers, investigations
are conducted concerning certain personnel.

Upon request, investigations are conducted concerning
staff personnel of seven Congressional Committees. These are
handled by agreement with the Department of Justice and include:

Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Senate Committee on Judiciary
House Committee on Judiciary
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy
Senate Appropriations Committee
House Appropriations Committee
Senate Armed Services Committee

At the request of the Department of Justice, investiga~
tions are conducted concerning Departmental Applicants for
Presidential appointments and professional positions such as
Federal Judges, United States Attorneys, and other legal positions.
In addition, investigations are conducted for the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts concerning applicants for the
positions of United States Magistrate, Federal Public Defender,

Investigations are also conducted of personnel who
have sensitive positions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
and the Energy Research and Development Administration (formerly
the Atomic Energy Commission).

In connection with all of these investigations, we
report the facts developed and furnish the results to the
requesting agency without any comment or recommendation or any
evaluation of the facts developed.

The costs involved concerning investigations on behalf
of the White House, Congressional Staff Committees, Department
of Justice, and Applications for Pardon After Completion of
Sentence, as well as cases referred to the FBI under various
public laws, are included in the overall FBI budget. In all other
investigations charges are made. The current rates for these
charges, which became effective on October 12, 1975, are listed
below. For Fiscal Year 1975, expenditures for these investigations
amounted to approximately $6,760,000 of which slightly over
$3,000,000 was reimbursed from other agencies. It is to be noted
the costs of thesa investigations fluctuate from year to year
dependent upon changes in salary, travel, and other expenses.

In early 1975, at the request of the SSC and the House
Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC), we began
conducting applicant~-type investigations of personnel assigned .-
to these committees and also of applicants for positions with these
committees. Through January 6, 1976, we have conducted 160 such
investigations received from the SSC and 39 received from the
Sc. Although no charges have been made, the costs involved at
the current rate would be $338,720 for the SSC and $82,563 for
the HSC, for a total of $421,283.

Pursuant to Constitutional Amendment 25, approved in
1967, the President requested an investigation in October of
1973, concerning Gerald R. Ford for the appointment to Vice
President. Then in August, 1974, an investigation was conducted
at the request of the President conceming Nelson Aldrich
Rockefeller, Vice President-Dasignate. ws, for the first time
in the history of the United States Government, an applicant~type
investigation was conducted concerning the President and Vice
President. These were the most extensive investigations ever
conducted by the FBE.of an applicant-type nature.

The investigations handled by the FBI are limited to
existing law, executive order, or by special agreement with the
President and/or the Attorney General. They are not routine and
it is not believed they should be or could be eliminated.

With Respect to Intelligence Aqtivities (SSC)

Where possible, steps have been taken to insure that these cases
are kept to an absolute minimum. It is noted prior to July,
1973, the FBI conducted investigations concerning nonprofessional
positions in connection with Departmental applicant/U. 8. Court
applicant investigations, such as general clerical personnel.

It was determined and agreed upon that these investigations could
be handled by the Civil Service Commission and, therefore, they
were transferred to that agency. \

rN
A manpower utilization survey conducted during March,

1975, disclosed that 2.3% of field investigative time by FBI

personnel was being devoted to these applicant-type investigations

conducted for other Government agencies. This low percentage

is indicative of the Bureau's efforts to hold down applicant-

type work to that assential and necessary to meet our various

commitments in this field, We have and will continue to oppose

legislation seeking to involve the FBI in routine applicant-type

investigations.

NOTE:

Senator Baker's question re Inspector General appears
on pages. 2473 and 2474 of the galley draft of Director Kelley's
testimony. It is felt the answer given is proper in that any
comment made re Inspector General concept governing other agencies
would, in fact, be a comment on behalf of the Director regarding
conditions existing in and/or needs of oversight, etc., of other
agencies which could be misconstrued. Senator Hart's questions
concerning COINTELPRO are contained on pages 2498 and 2499 of the
proof and Senator Church's questions appear on pages 2506, 2507
and 2508 of the proof. This matter has been coordinated by the
Senstudy Project with Legal Counsel Division, Section IS-2 of
INTD and the Employee Security and Special Inquiry Section of
the Special Investigative Division.

INFORMATION CONCERNENG
“ 4

Jaffe is a former New York Office informant
who was a correspondent for CBS and ARC, While with ABC,
he was stationed in Moscow from 1961 to 1965, During this
assignnent he was compromised by the KGB through
relationship he had with a Soviet femile and because of a
car accident, daffe reported the subsequent recruitment
effort by the KGB to both the U, 5. Embassy and to
New York, He admitted to New York that hoe had a continuing
relationship in Moscow with several KGD officers, but
denied that he furnished them anything, In 1964, a Soviet
defector reported that Jaffe had been recruited by the KGB
in about 1961 and thereafter furnished the KGB with
information about other Americans in Moscow. Our investigation,
including two intensive interviews of Jaffe, neither
substantiated or refuted the defector'’s allegation.w

Our evaluation of Jafie's relationship with the
KGB is that after his admitted compromise he undoubtediy
cooperated to a degree, simply to avoid heing expelled
from Moscow because of the damage it would have caused
to his then advancing career, He was eventually expelied
in 1965, ostensibly because of an unfavorable article
written by ABC Correspondent Johu Scali about the Soviet
leadership, We have never uncovered any evidence that
daffe assisted the KGB after he left Moscow. vu

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: San A, dafie
10528333

Jaffe filed a Freedom of Information Act request
in 1975 for all information in our files, claiming that
the FRE or CIA had leaked an allegation that he was 2 KGZ
agent, which has prevented him from obtaining employment
in the media field, Wis claim is not substantiated by
anything contained in our files. Both the Senate and House
Committees on Intelligence Operations have taken an interest
in his case and we have furnished both Committees with excised
copies of Jafte's file. vu

The "Washington Star News" issue of 1/22/76, carried
an article reporting an interview of Jaffe by a “New York Times''
reporter in which Jaffe related he had been an unpaid FEI
informant during the 1950s and 1960s, reporting on his contacts
with Soviet nationals, *The article is generally factual and
does not touch on Jaffe's allegation as to 2 leak. On 1/21/75,
Jaffe telephoned SA Richard Kinsey of the Intelligence Division
(SA Kinsey had participated in an interview of Jaffe on 11/24/75,
ou Deputy Associate Director Adams' instructions to hear out
Jaffe's allegations), Jaffe was concerned because an unnamed
“New York Times" reporter had interviewed him on the same day
and inferred he had informition that Jafie was a paid FBI
informant, daffe wanted to know if we had so advised either the
Senate or House Committees since the reporter claimed to have
seen documentation that Jaffe had received money from the FEI,
Jaffe was advised that he could not be furnished information
as to what we had furnished the Committees but that he knew
whether or not he had received money from us. Jaffe said that
he was concerned that we had leaked additional derogatory
information concerning hin. vy

While it is possible that the "New York Times"
yeporter has had access to Jaffe's file as furnished to the
Senate ox House Committees, it is not believed that we have
sufficient evidence of this in order to make a complaint to
either Committee, based only on what Jaffe reported as to
the reporter's background for his induiry of Jaffe. vu

* Our vecords disclose that Jaffe was never paid, either for
services or expenses during the period he was operated as a
symbol number informant J

information, cur repular destruction proprac:, as approved by the
National Archives and Eecords Service, is cesigued to prevent retention
of asses of records well beyond the poriod curiny which they may serve
auseful puxpese, Yurther, our xecords destruction progeam, as
agoxoved by the National Archivist, percrits the destruction of those
Peeords which are cee-ued to no loncer possess evidentiary, intellicence,
or historical value, The oratoriu.a, which was not expected to last as.
jong as it Has, has created substantial ad-sinistrative burdens not only
at PDI Headquarters but throughout our 59 Held offlees, The sugeension
of sound records cconacecsent and file destruction practices in caany arenas
is causing very substantial space and stoxaze profleas,

1, therefore, now propose, with your concurrence, to
resu-ue that povtion of our records destruction prograca which, in reality,
could not have been conta-aplated by the Cenate leadership's request in
the first instance, ‘Ye would continue the destruction coratoriu-: on all
classifications of files chich would fall within the ceneral ceserigtion of
“geeurity files.’ These would cacompass all files on comestic intelticenco
tations, axtrewist matters, racial otters, ag yell as foreign counter-
intelligence subject matters, Ve would, with recard to such “security
waatters,’ destroy duplicative material only.

‘The matters that we 2 propose to resume routine destruction
of, in accordance with our previously established Records Uetention Flan,
are the following: files relating to cri sinal investizations, sultaiility or
applicant-type investications, correspondence flea, wad files of an
adcinistyative nature cenerally, Should you or any ciecbers of your
Conciittes express an interest for our continued retention of any record
waterial other than as specified herein, you 2ay be assured that such a
request would receive every consideration.

Dear Mike:

Information has come to the attention of the
Committee which indicates the possibility that the FBI
conducted heretofore undisclosed electronic surveillance
of personnel of the executive office of the President
(possibly a Deputy Director of the Budget Bureau) and that
this information was included on a list of names of persons
subject to FBT electronic surveillance prepared for Attorney
General Elliot Richardson in or about July 1973.

Therefore, the Committee requests all material
in the possession of the Justice Department or the FBI
which may bear on the above. Please notify me by phone
when any such material may be available.
