MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: South Vietnam

I attach two reports which the President ought to

see. The first is a summary by the CIA in Saigon of the

current political situation (TDCS-3/552, 770). It strikes

me as being a fair and accurate appraisal.

The second is a report by Maj. General Victor

(Brute) Krulak, USMC, on his recent visit to Vietnam.

It gives, I think, a fair and soundly optimistic picture

of the part of the iceberg which is under water, i. e. the

war against the Viet Cong.
