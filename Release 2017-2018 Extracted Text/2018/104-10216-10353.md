been intended for, and levied on, AMLASH-1, However, due to
the fact that AMWHIP-1 was together in Europe with AMLASH=1,
AMZHIP-1 was debriefed on the requirements on the outside
chance that he might have Some complimentary information on then.

ete a. Orlando Blanco, Cuban Diplomat in Bern, Switzerland.
AWTHIP-1 was unable to give any additional information on
Blanco as he had not eet the man in Europe and does not remesber
having met hie in Havana. (AMWHIP=1 stated that AMLASH-1
Clained that he (AMNHIP-1) bad in fact met Blanco a number
Of years ago in Havana, but AMWHIP says he truly does not
remember the man.) He stated that any additional informetion
0a Blanco would have to come from either AMLASH~1 or AMLASH-3.
In approaching Blanco for cooperation, AMWHIP strongly ;

—>> suggested that it would be best to ued AMLASH-3 for. the
initial contact. AMWHIP stated that BLANCO knew AMLASH-3 well

Castro) of AMLASH-1, AMWHIP-1 was told we were loosing into

b. In discussing CUHOPS' desire to cooperate, AMWHIP
stated that QUHOPS would do what he could to help but that
in exchange for this he wanted to get his wife, two children,
and bis mother-in-iaw to the United States along with hiese!l?f.
AMVHIP-1 stated that QUHOPS' plan in brief was to accept
the guard duty on Sunday thus maxing probably only himself
and the wife of code cler: present in the embassy. Ve
thanzed AMVHIP for his information and suggestions and
stated that they would be conveyed to the appropriate parties

concerned.

©. Gustavo GONZALES. (AMLASH-1's “cousin") AMWHIP~1
stated that he had no Information on Gonzales, in whom
Nestor Sanchez has an with regard to his
(Sanchez') pending Oo Caracas, Venezuela.

d. “Venezuelan” Returning from Moscow. Regarding the
Venezuelan who has reportedly to have just come from Yoscow
and returning to Cuba, AM#HIP-1 stated that he had no
information to contribute about the man. He did say, however,
that one time during his recent trip to the Cuban Embassy
Paris talking with UNSNAFU-19, the Ambassador had interrupted
their conversation in order to tal< to two men (about 30-35
years old). AMWHIP-1 met them briefly and was told by one
of thes that they were from Oriente Province. AMWHIP-1
stated that he could tell immed: ly by their accents
that they were not Cuban. In order to confirm this he
asked them where in Oriente they were from because one of the
Cuban officials in Paris was from Oriente and always wanted
to chat with any people from Oriente who passed through Paris.
After a brief stumbling exercise, groping for a name of a
city in Oriente, the "Cuban" confessed that they vere not
Cubans but Venezuelans. AMWHIP did not have suffident tine
to learn more about them. The two Yenezuelans spent about
thirty minutes talking with UNSNAFU-19 while AMWHIP was there.
He did not know how much longer previous to this thirty
minutes that the Venexuelans had been in the Embassy or to vhom
Se they talked. AMMHIP-1 suggested that UNSNAFU-9 might
be able to obtain the names of the two Venezuelans in question.

©. UNSNAFU-19's Membership in the “Gaslight Club".

* As 2 support service for a Paris Station operation to get
UNSNAFU-19 membership in the Gaslight Club where it would be
attempted to run a highly desirable female agent against him.
AMLASH-1 stated that he had been unable, due to UNSNATU-19's
busy schedule, to get the latter down to the Gaslight Club
and enrolled as a member. AMWHIP stated, however, that be
could do the job just as well by taxing out a gift membership
for UNSNAFU-19 through the Gasligbt Club in New Yor« City,
and sending UNSNAFU-19's membership card and “ey to him in
Paris. We encouraged AMWHIP-1 to do this and to xeep us
advised of his progress. a

~. Cuban Air Force Comandante BICLois, Regarding
DICLOIS who had allegedly arrived in Parla from Algeria during
the time that Sanchez and AMWHIP-1 were there, AMWHIP-1 said
that he did not know the man or did he have any information on
® Comandante with that name or a name that sounded lise that,
Be said that he had heard Something about a Comandante with a
strange name but he could not contribute more than that. He
Suggested that AMLASH-1 might be able to identify the man.

@. Security man with Che Guevara. AMWRIP-1 was
asked if he had any Information on aman called "Bernis”
‘eportedly one of the men who accompanied Che Guevara on his
rican trip, and probably also the one to China ag a member of
his security force. AMWVHIP said that the name did not register
ith him and he had no other information to give. He again
suggested that AMLASH-1 might be able to help. One thing sore
AMPEIP. eaid.wag that he did not thinx that any of Che's security
men were named Bernis, and he thought this was not a correct
He did say, however, that while he was in Paris there had

ne

dark green trunzs about the size of foot locxers and four or
five suitcases. AMWEIP said that they both had pistols, one a
Soviet machine pistol and the other a 32 calibre. AMWHIP does not
Yrewember the exact date that they left Paris for Madrid but he
Femembers that the flight left at 4:50 in the afternoon and

took place about two weeks ago (ca. 5 February). ALWHIP says that
UNSHAFU-9 knows both of these men and could be contacted for their
names and a better description.

bh. Carlos Frangjui. AMWHIP-1 had no additional
~tafermetica on Franqui except to say that he <new he was not
happy. He wlso believed that AMLASH-1 had additional information

i. B& L Locomotives. with regard to the requirements
concerning secu¥ity measures on the shiprent of locomotives to
Cuba, AMWHIP said that he had no additional information to
contribute. AMVHIP also stated that he had obtained no additional
information from FISSOLA, the engineer concerned with the shipaent,,
to, and the use of, these locomotives, AMVHIP stated that he
thought AMLASH-1 might have some additional information. AMWHIP
also stated that he thought “Americo" talis too much and that
maybe "Mario" would be best to assist in the operation.

J- AMLASH@1's Accommodation Address A: men ts
AMHIP-1 stated that he bad reviewed accommoda addresses

with AMLASH-1 and had given appropriate instructions to
AMMHIP-2 in the event of the receipt of letters frou

Havana signed by AMLASH-1 or signed by a “Cuban” whoa
AMWIHIP-2 did not know. (Comment: it was a good thing ve
reviewed accommodation address with AMWHIP-1, see below.)
For the record AMLASH~1 will address his letters to AMWHIP-2
either in care of bis business address in Home which is:

Rosa
or to AMHIPLS's business address in Geneva (which incidentally
is identical with his home ad BIP=-2 opera io
Geneva from his apartment) Geneva, Switzerland.

(it should be noted that A! 2 intends to open a proper
office in Geneva in the near future. However, this is no
particular reason for changing the accommodation address in
Geneva.) AIMWHIP-% stated that he had given the undersigned's
Postoffice box in Washington (William A. Thompson, P.O.

Box 7224,.Apox Station, Washington, D.C. to AMWHIP-2, believing
that this would’ expedite our receipt of letters froa AMLASH-1.
AMIHIP=1l was told that his concern for rapid transaittal of

‘the letters was certainly appreciated, but that for security

sake, it was much better that they be forwarded in a cover
envelope to AMTHIP's address in New Yorx City, preforably,
his business address. AMWHIP': vas also told to remind
AMTHIP-2 that he should handle the letters he received from
Havana as little as possible and put them in cover envelopes
and send them as quiccly as possible to AMWHIP-1 in New Yor«
City. In this connection it remains the problem of obtaining
these letters on a expeditious basis when AMWHIP-1 is, for
exemple, out of town for a prolonged absence. It. is
suggested that William Thompson's accommodation business

in Washington be given to AHWHIP's father so that he may
forward AMWHIP-2's letters to Washington without undue delay.
(This is an excellent example of a brea<down in coupartmentation
in Cuban operations.)

k. Paris Embassy Personnel. According to a telephone
eall on 18 February from SH-I in Paris, AMWHIP-1 stated
that AMLASH-1 had said that UNSNAFU-8 and, perhaps, UXSKAFU-9
Would be out of jobs in the near future in accordance with
the present economy drive by the Cubans. AMLASH stated that
UNSNAFU-8 wost certainly would be ousted, while UNSNAFU-9's
case was more uncertain.

“I. Cuban Government Financial Straits. (Ref.
PARI 9067, IN 73872, 4 February 65) AYWHIP-[ added some
additional comments on the silver payments cited in ref.
AMWHIP#l stated that the Cubars were apparently very anxious
to sell the silver cited in Ref. Actually AMWHIP-1
stated that the total amount of the payments would be in
the neighborhood of $350,000 and this included antiques,
postage stanps, silver bullion, and “wor<ed" silver articles.
AMUHIP alsotgtated that he kad been assed if he would
be willing/buy $100,000 worth of silver on the spot, the
cash to be placed in a reputable international ban«.
This discussion had been carried on by international telephone
with Pepin Sanchez, brother-in-law of Celia Sanchez, and Jose
Iglesias Lopez, good friend of AMWHIP=1 and former Havana
Jeweler, AMWHIP-1 talxed to the above in Havana from the Cuban
Embassy, Paris. This $100,000 was a part of the total $350,000
mentioned above. AMWHIP-1 turned down the sale, stating that
he did not normally deal in silver, and was not sure of the
value of the vorked items offered for sale. AMWHIP-1 stated
that this sale was to be executed on behalf of Castro
Personally and did not necessarily reflect the overall
financial picture of the Cuban government. AMWHIP-1 stated
that AMLASH-1 had told him that such an action was typical
of Castro, who in many instances, conducted business
arrangersnte of his own, without regard or without consultation,
with the members of his goverosent normally involved in Cuban
national finances. AMMHIP-1 stated that UNSNAFU-19 also had
intimated the above. AMMHIP-1 stated that he believed that
this money was needed for the downpayment on two factories
which had been purchased by the Cubans in Great Britain.
He also stated that he believed these factories were for
the processing of agricultural products of some type. Also,
concerning the silver, according to AMWHIP-1, that 30% had
been reduced to bullion and that the rest consisted of "worsed"
gilver articles (antiques, art treasures, jewelry, etc.)
AMMHIP stated that this entire offering of silver antiques, etc.
had eventually been sold on the spot in Havana for cash to
an unknown person of Turcish/Itaiian bac«ground. AMWHIP
tried to find out the identity of the person but neither
UNSRAFU-19, in person, nor Iglesias, by phone, would
{ Feveal the identity of the buyer. AMWHIP-1 offered to urite
or as< Iglesias for the name, but we cautioned against it
as shoving undue interest in the matter, AMWHIP-1 was told
“that {f he ever saw [zlesias in person and could safely asc
him he should do so together with any details he could
obtain about the transaction, as it was related to Cuban
fimancial problens. Ai#HIP-{ stated that on his return to

(Ronen mage,

the Paris Aubessador's conference in Madrid, UNSNAFU-19 carried
@ very large trunk in his car. It was 80 heavy that the rear of
the car was clearly weighted-down, AMWHIP speculated that this
trunk had been brought to Madrid by Arnold RODRIGUEZ Camps and
was turned over to UNSNAPU-19 prior to the latter's return to
Paris. in connection with this, AMWHIP-) received @ phone call
from AMLASH-1 from Paris stating that UNSNAFU-19 was soing to
Geneva on the 18th of February and had invited AMLASH-1.
AMLASH~1 declined the invitation, due to his desire to return to
Havana vio Madrid on the 23rd of this month. On the morning of
the 19th of February AMWHIP-1 received a call fros AMWHIP-2
stating that UNSNAFU-19 was driving to Geneva on the 19th. He
had with him some $11,000 in silver articles. AMIHIP-2, who saw
the items, said that the "stuff was cheap” (meaning inferior
workmanship and quality).

m. AMLASH-1, Morale and Finances. We then broached the
topic of Al 8a and present frame of mind after our
refusal to give him $10,000 that he requested for operational
uses. AMWHIP=1 stated that he thought AMLASH-1 vas not overly
disturbed by this, but that in general he was sonevhat upset by
the fact that he had even entered into negotiations with AMBIDDY-1,
objecting to bis “political mentality". It might be noted that
AMVHIP-1 also stated his reservations about AMBIDDY-1. Frou
this, we derived the feeling that AMLASH-1 and AMMHIP-1 both
had strong but unspecified reservations about the motivation and
morality of AMBIDDY-1. AMLASH said that due to this reservation
of AMLASH-1's, and due to the relative newness of the contact,
AMLASH-1 vas extremely reluctant to taxe any money from AMBIDDY-1,

_Which, of course, in the end he did not. AMWHIP~1 stated that
AMLASH felt that he had been pushed by the Americans into a
basically unwanted relationship with AMBIDDY-1. AMWHIP-1 stated
that he, as well as AMLASH-1 were still baffled at the American
reluctance to deal across the board on all matters with
AMLASH-1. He stated that AMLASH-1 had received certain items
from AMBIDDY-1 that he was not able to obtain from the Americans.
AWIHIP-1 made it a point to state that AMLASH-1 noted immediately
and pointedly that the items provided to hin by AMBIDDY~1 vere
not homemade nor apparently one-of-<ind items. (the inference here
being quite clearly conveyed to the undersigned was that these
items obviously came from commercial sources.)

nm. The Subject of the Funds Requested by AMLASH. AMOEIP
stated that these wore absolutely necessary Yor AULASH to seep
people of his choice in particular jobs where they could be of

he stated that he had Given $7,000 to AMLASH-1. ATHIP=1 ~
etated that AMLASH-1 did not, da fact, have the money yet and

that the moneg - would be Given to his Probably this weekend

(20-2) February) in Paris by ANWHIP-2. AK@HIP-1 Stated that
AMVHIP-2 had becono involved in the trancaction because he

had to appoal to him for help in raising the woney io a fairly |
confidential’ manner, Arrangezents to give AMLASE-1 money
during hie stay in Kadrid had fallen through, AMVHIP had
learned, thus the reason for AMFHIP-2's being forced to go

to Paris in order to give it to him this weekend, AMWHIP-1
also stated that AMLASH-1 hed asked Jose ‘Iglesias in Havana
for sone 3,000 pesos. Iglesias was not able to raise the sum
at the time requested. Uhether or not he is attempting to do
60 nov, or has succeeded: in doing so during AMLASH-1's absence,
4s not known at this time. It should be noted that: dering
@iecussions concerning the AMBIDDY/AMLASH relationship, ANWHIP
Stated that AMBIDDY had told AMLASH of at least 8980 portion of
Bis connections with the Americans. AM#HIP-1 stated that he had .
Sat in on the discussions during which tine AMBIDDY purportedly
nade this statement. AMVHIP also atated, os he had doze in
Previous neetings, that neither he or AMLASH could understand

why the Americans did not make further use of AHLASE-~3 and
AMLASH-2. He aleo felt that there were Bany bits and pieces

of the whole picture that vere net tied into a neat-bindle and
utilized to their full extent by the Americans. The unders.

at ro time admitted that be was avere of any AMBIDDY/Ansrican

involving only AMWHIP, He felt that he could be more effective
with continuous guidance and direction during his European
sojourns. (AMWHIP also implied that the case officers were .
understandably busy with their many local probiems and could
not devote as much time as possibly was desirable to AMWHIP-1's
ease. On the other hand, AMWHIP=-1 delicately submitted that

if he was willing to taxe the time for the operations, and if
in fact they were worthwhile and necessary, we should make
every reasonable effort to glean the most benefit from his
efforts. In summary, if feasible, he prefers to deal with one
case officer on 211 aspects of his operational activity.

AMLASH~1, According to AMVHIP-1, he and ANLASH-1 have
established an open code for signalling his desire for exfiltration
or to inform AMMHIP-1 when the date of his Attempt will be.
Exfiltration involves the use of birthday greetings to Loretta
Sylvia indicate exfiltration from Matanzas or Miramar,
respectively. AMBIDDY~1 presumably has the details for execution

In response ie request for bis opfafon this subject

‘after it had been outlined as agreed upon at Headquarters,

AHIP=1 stated that he thought that he could carry this off
without UNSKAFU-19 being Suspicious. He stated that this type
of information would have to coue forth at the right moment in
@ natural manner, and during a rather lengthy personal meeting.
He felt that to do this by telephone or letter would be totally
out of keeping with his normal rélationship with UNSNAFU-19
and that it should not be done in that manner. In response to
the suggestion, however, he said that it could be done if his

& normal business trip to Europe. He also stated that he felt
he had to have something upon which to peg the story. AMWHIP=-1
agreed with the feasibility of the Buggestion of putting him in
touch with a reputable businessman in New Yorx, who has good
connections in Governsent circies in Washington and whom he
conceivably could have <xnown for some time ag 2 result of a
normal business relationship. AMWHIP-1 agreed to return to
Europe in ive or three wee«s especially to perform this tas.
He was in agreement with the undersigned's idea that, in order
to play it as safely as possible, this meeting with UNSNAFU-19
Should not taxe place at least until after the 24th of February,
the expected retura date of AMLASH-1 to Havana. Both. for this

made for him to «mow about, or actually to meet, the ostensible
sourec of this information in New Yor< sometime during the last
week of Pebrusry or the first weex of March. He was told also

to xeep in touch with the undersigned in the event of any

news received from Europe concerning AMLASH-1 or any of the

cast of charactera in this menorandus.
