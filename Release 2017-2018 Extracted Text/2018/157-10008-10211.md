Summary of Contacts with

AS SANITIZED (1)( 5)

o at Mar F4 a,

. AMAHTP arrived in Helsinki on 30 July 1962, He called

Ea

according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's

abysxral understanding of English), Case Gfjumestablished contact with

AMSHIP without further difficulty. The meeting took place in the hue ded >

restaurant of his hotel, ns, and later ‘n his room. We had Lye a

not at this time located AMLASH, so the time was spent briefing AYAHIP

on the local scene, and on his conduct with AMLASH shen they met. The

‘7 meeting lasted about one and a half hours.

Later the same day we called AMWHIP at his hotel to report
no progress in locating AMLASH. Feeling it advisable to keep AMMHIP
cccupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the
suburbs of Helsinki. The evening lasted until 1200, terminating witha

dranic at the roof bar of the. Yaakuna. During the six hours, we had an

opportunity to. lly to AMWHIP that in order for us to help

his friend, AMLASH must. be" willing to follow our directions’ and agree to

certain. condi. (albeady agreed upon by interested Hqs. parties).

AMWHIP realized: that this was necessary, and agreed with our ideas. However,

. Sen R and subjective manner. This being rather far removed from our
Pd 15S aed approach to, and opinion of AMLASH. Asean TP will require handling
