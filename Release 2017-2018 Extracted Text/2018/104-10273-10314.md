. 4, The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends
with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala?

ad. DoeS ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-
tiel treatment by U. S. authorities which
permit him to carry firearms, as weil as
to purchase arms and ammunition for
shipment to Guatemala?

e. Any information on Robert and Gerald

HEMMING?
5. On 19 June 1976 > advised
that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State

Department.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HEMMING.

7. From the name, physical description, activity, and
alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
429 229, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds,
who is a notorious mercenary and soldier of fortune and who as
of May 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation
company, TEPCOL Security (Office of Security--no record) in
Miami, Florida.



8. Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,
the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JINAVE. On
, HEMMING

Mumerous occasions since at least the éarly 1960's
had clai gency affiliation when in fact there

none, Tf ost recent incident wherein HEMMING cl

affiliat was in May 1975S when he volunteered his services

to the D _Enforcement Administration. Gerald Patrick HEMMING
is a lo cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

aka: Fr ORINI, of Watergate notoriety who ‘also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In

« the late 1250's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel _ CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
Claiming < ilusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon enegeatter,
STURGIS anized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

. zr eee which he named the International
Anti-Communist Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom nave never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalzn government expose of this assassination plot
involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandun, to wiz: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;
and an'extract from a book published in early 1976 written by
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kenned
is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency
with the assassination of..President KENNEDY. One of the najor
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,”
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL, Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
nental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jin"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
