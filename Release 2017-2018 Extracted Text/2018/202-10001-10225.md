MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) on
Operation MONGOOSE, 14 September 1962

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy; the Attorney General; Mr. Johnson; Mr. Nitze,
i General Leamitzer, General Lansdale; General Carter;
Mr. Donald Wilson

1. The Group approved in principle General Lansdale's paper
of 31 August, with the amendments that had been agreed upon at last
week's meeting and which were attached to General Lansdale's memo-
randum of 12 September. However, Mr. Bundy made it clear that this
did not constitute blanket approval of every item in the paper and
that sensitive ones such as sabotage,’ for example, will have to be
presented in more detail ona case by case basis.

2. General Lansdale noted that he has asked appropriate people
in the Pentagon to draw up estimates covering requirements for person-
nel, space, communications, etc., against the contingency that Cuban
operations will move into a more active phase and will require such

be adducegipefore the OAS Foreign Ministers' meeting would be highly
valuable
5. General Lansdale reported that the NSA collection program
is being stepped up considerably and should be in full swing by
1 November.
6. Mr. Bundy expressed his concern about the necessity for
linking planning in the political and military fields with the MONGOOSE
Operations. He said that his tentative conclusion is that what is
required is a tightly knit interagency group closely tied co the
MONGOOSE group but not a part of it. He said he would discuss this
concept with higher authority.

fea General Carter reported on CIA's contacts with Pan anerican'y
regarding its Havana flights. He said that the company had asked
the Agency to buy its blocked pesos at a one-for-one rate at a scale H
of $140,000 a month retroactive to last May Ist. He said that in the
face of this proposal, CIA had agreed to buy $200,000 worth, provided fl
Pan American makes no move at this time to discontinue its service. i

He said there were assurances that no such move would be made before
October lst at the earliest.

After some discussion, the Group agreed that it is highly
CIA desirable to maintain this service. On theother hand, it appears
: that /Pan American's estimates of the amount of money it is* losing and \/ 2
7.9 %2)(u)| the amount of subsidy required to break evenjare apparently excessive.

| General Carter undertook to look into the possibility, suggested by \

\ the Attorney General, that Pan American could lower its quoted fare,
imasmuch as the company is not getting the benefit of the $20) now in. §

It was generally agreed that government operation of this
Service would be juste as expensive as having Pan American continue it.,

a 8. The Attorney General raised the question of actions by
Cuban exile students against the Castro regime. He recognized, as did
the rest of the Group, the fact that these wactivities can serve as a ‘
cover for future U.S.-sponsored operations. ! 'on the other “hand, it was
recognized equally that bad publicity could’ result. | | It was suggested
that CIA might talk to selected students and spread the idea that any
active operations planned by them must in fact be reasonable and worth-
while ones, and to leave the idea that irresponsible actions might
lead to trouble for them in the future. 4 _
