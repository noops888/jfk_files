Summary of Contact:

I called Mr. Phillips to ask him about his testimony on 11/27/76 that there

were two or three cameras covering the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in 1963.

Mr. Phillips said that he was not absolutely sure about that but his

recollection was that there were two cameras. One covered the Embassy

enterance because they were interested in the political visitors, and the

other covered the Consulate because they were interested in people who

were traveling to Cuba. He said his recollection is reinforced by his

memory of going back over the photos looking for Oswald after the assass?

nation when he knew that Oswald had been at the Consulate. He said that

it may have been that there was a manned photo base covering the Embassy

entrance and an "impulse" camera covering the consulate entrance.

Mr.

Phillips was not sure about when Saturday coverage was instituted. He

was sure that the Embassy and Consulate would have been covered during

business hours, at least.
