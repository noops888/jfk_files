INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC FK

On June 9, 1965, MM T-1, another government agency

which conducts intelligence type investigations, advised

that the following information was received from a Cuban

refugee associated with activists in the Miami area.

A commando force of 49 Cuban exiles and 11 Amer-

icans is being formed in Miami by ODELIO GARCIA DERIZANZO

and GERALD PATRICK HEMMING/ It is being supported by an

unidentified person believed to reside outside of the

Miami area.

The commando team is to be used by Dominican

General ANTONIO IMBER BERRERAS, head of the Loyalist

Forces in the Dominican Republic (DR). Presumably this

commando group will try to overthrow rebel forces in the

DR.

On June 8, 1965, GARCIA and ATON CONSTANZO PALAU

met with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING who said that 10 of his

followers, all American citizens, were ready to join the

49 Cuban exiles in the Dominican operation's, u

stated that CONSTANZO and HEMMING use an application form

for the recruits to complete and of the thousands of young

unemployed Cuban refugees in Miami recruitment is easy.

MM T-2 pointed out that General IMBERT has ade-

quate forces in the DR and with U.S. and OAS Forces in

that country, it is highly unlikely that 60 Cuban exiles

and American

adventurers would be of any value.

MM T-2 explained that CONSTANZO and HEMMING are

constantly involved in plans for revolutionary activity,

the plans never materialize and it appears highly unlikely

that this plan will ever be put into force.

MM I-3, a Dominican national, who has furnished

reliable information in the past and is in close associa-

tion with Dominican Consulate officials in Miami, on June

11, 1965 stated that the DR Consulate in Miami has not

issued any visas since April 25, 1965 and does not plan.

to issue any in the near future.

MM T-3 said that after U.S. Armed Forces landed

In the DR on April 28, 1965 and the subsequent arrival of

OAs troops, there is no need for Cuban exile volunteers

and none are wanted.

MM 1-3 explained that in early May, 1964, some

Cuban exiles in Miami visited the Dominican Consulate

and volunteered their services in the DR to fight against

Communism. Consulate officials felt that the Cuban

volunteers were more interested in obtaining press
