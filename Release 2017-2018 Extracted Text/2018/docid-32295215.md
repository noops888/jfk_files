NEUTRALITY MATTERS 42-1848
INTERNAL SECURITY ~ DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (FK )

On June 9, 1965, MM T-1, another government agency
which conducts intelligence type investigations, advised
that the. following information was received from a Cuban
refugee associated with activists in the Miami area.

A commando force of 49 Cuban ee and Amer~
icans is being formed in Miami by ODELIO* ARCLATDERIZANZO.. /
and GERALD PATRICK HEMMING,” It is being supported by an
unidentified person believed to reside outside of the
Miami area. The comma am is to be used by Dominican |
General ANTONIO. IMBEBY BERRERAS , head of the Loyalist

. Forces in the Dominfcan Republic (DR). Presumably this
commando group will try to overthrow rebel forces in the

DR Me

On June 8, 1965, GARCIA and ATON CONSTANZO PALAU
met with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING who said that 10 of his
followers, all American citizens, were ready to join the
49 Cuban exiles in the Dominican operation.

several times for involvement in these activities. MM T-2
stated that CONSTANZO and HEMMING use an application form
for the recruits to complete and of the thousands of young
unemployed Cuban refugees in Miami recruitment is easy.

; MM T-2 pointed out that General IMBERT has ade-
quate forces in the DR and with U.S. and OAS Forces in
that country, it is highly unlikely that 60 Cuban exiles
and American adventurers would be of any value.

MM T-2 explained that CONSTANZO and HEMMING are
constantly involved in plans for revolutionary activity,
the plans never materialize and it appears highly unlikely
that this plan will ever be put into force. _

MM T-3, a Dominican national, who has furnished
reliable information in the past and is in close associa-
tion with Dominican Consulate officials in Miami, on June
11, 1965 stated that the DR Consulate in Miami has not
issued any visas since April 25, 1965 and does not plan.
to issue any in the near future.

MM T-3 said that after U.S. Armed Forces landed
in the DR on April 28, 1965 and the subsequent arrival of
OAS troops, there is no need for Cuban exile volunteers
and none are wanted.

MM T-3 explained that in early May, 1964, some
Cuban exiles in Miami visited the Dominican Consulate
and volunteered their services in the DR to fight against
Communism, Consulate officials felt that the Cuban
volunteers were more interested in obtaining press
