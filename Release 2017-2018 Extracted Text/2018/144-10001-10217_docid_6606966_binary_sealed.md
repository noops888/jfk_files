Dear Mr. Brand:

Pursuant to our conversation of ll May, enclosed please

correspondence or records of communications between NSA and

the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

The documents

were released as the result of an initial request and prior

to our knowledge of congressional intent that this information

be maintained in confidentiality.

Future requests of this nature will be handled in accordance

with expressed congressional intent; we would appreciate receiving,

however, a letter addressed to this Agency specifying current

congressional views with respect to the information maintained

by NSA.

If you have any questions do not hesitate to call me or

Stanley Brand, General Counsel, Clerk of the House

of Representatives

M/R: This

response was coordinated with Q4 (Dinwoodie) on

classification and with Stan Brand, General Counsel to the

Clerk of the House of

Representatives in determining whether

correspondence originating with the House Select Committee

on Assassinations are NSA records.

Mr. Brand informed us of

correspondence from Louis Stokes to Executive Agencies that

congressional material and related information in a form connected

to the Committee should not be disclosed without the written

concurrence of the House of Representatives.

A subsequent letter

from the Clerk of the House affirmed this decision.

He told us

that he believes the Committee inadvertently neglected to send

the

Stokes letter to NSA.

Copies of both letters are attached for

your information, and, for LAO, your file.

As Q4 had already released the NSA-originated records (not

knowing about the Stokes request), we decided to uphold their

findings.

Future requests of this

nature should be handled in

accordance with the Stokes and Henshaw letters.

If any documents

covered by these letters are to be released they must first be

coordinated with

and approved by Stan Brand, General Counsel

to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. His phone

number

is 225-7000.

Mark Allen has sued CIA under the FOIA for withholding

information responsive to a similar reguest.

The D.C. Circuit

in November 1980 remanded that case to the District Court, .

but made some rulings on the (b) (1) and (b) (3) exemptions

problem which would result from requests under the Freedom

11 May 1981

Mr. Mark Allen

P.0. Box 9032

Washington, D.C. 20003

Dear Mr. Allen:

This replies to your letter of 8 April 1981 in which you

appeal the National Security Agency's (NSA) denial of information

responsive to your

Freedom of Information Act request.

I have

reviewed your initial request of 12 January 1981, the nine records

located in response to that request, NSA's letter of 16 March

1981 which forwarded one record in its entirety and portions of

eight other records, and your letter of appeal. As the result

of this review, I am again sending you the releasable portions

of eight documents and I

am'referencing herein the laws that

preclude disclosure of certain segments of these documents.

I

have also decided to release additional portions of three records

that were released to you by the Chief, Office of Policy, and

amended copies

of those records are attached.

However,

I affirm

the determination of the Chief, Office of Policy, that the

remaining portions of the attached records must be withheld.

The ninth document, an unclassified letter from

Eugene Yeates

to Robert Blakey dated 14 July 1978 was released to you in its

entirety and

therefore does not need to be addressed.

Set forth below are descriptions of the

eight

records which

were

withheld in part and the reasons for withholding those

portions of them.

The reasons for withholding are

as responsive

as possible without disclosing

classified information.

The U.S.

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has recognized that

information disclosed by an agency about withheld documents does

not have to contain facts

that if made public would compromise

the secret nature of the information.

A more detailed explanation of the rationale for each exemption follows:

With

respect to the classifications assigned to the portions

of documents 2 through 8

being withheld, I have concluded that

they meet the criteria for classification in Section 1-3 of Executive

Order 12065 and

in paragraph 2-202 of DoD Regulation 5200.1-R and

that the withheld portions

are properly classified in their entirety

within the categories provided in Section 1-1 of Executive Order

12065 and in Chapter I, Section 5 of DoD Regulation 5200.1-R.

records have

been reviewed for possible declassification or down-

grading

according to the provisions of sections 3-1 and

3-3 of

Executive Order

of Chapter III of DoD Regulation 5200. 1-R.

Portions that were declassified

are enclosed; the remaining portions

were found to

be properly classified and therefore excluded from

declassification or downgrading despite the length of time which

origin. In conducting

this review, I

have weighed the significant need for openness

in government against

security at this time.

I have specifically taken into account Section

3-303 of Executive

Order 12065 and have determined that the records, except for the

portions released, should continue to be classified. Thus, I finc

2

---

## Page 9

Doc ID: 6606966

that the Chief, Office of Policy, properly found these portions

to be exempt from release pursuant to 5 U.S.C. $552(b) (1), and I

affirm his denial

of your request for release of these portions

on those grounds.

Portions of each of the eight documents are exempt fiom

disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. $552(b) (3).

Section 6 of Public

Law 86-36 provides that no law

shall be construed to require

the disclosure of

the organization, personnel, functions or

activities of the National Security Agency.

Each of

the

records contains information falling

into

this description.

The National Security Agency

is precluded by 18 U.S.C. $798

from providing information concerning classified communications

intelligence activities except to those persons authorized to

receive such

information.

50 U.s.c. 8403(d) (3) protects infor-

mation pertaining to intelligence

Withheld

portions of documents 3 through 8 contain information protected

by these statutes.

Enclosure 6 of DOD Directive 5400.7 (32

C.F.R.

$286 (1980)) specifically recognizes 18 U.S.C. $798

and

Public Law 86-36 as exemption 3 statutes.

Thus, I also find that

the Chief, Office of Policy, properly concluded

that portions of

the documents were exempt from release pursuant to 5 U.s.C.

5552 (b)(3), since each of the statutes and the directive cited

above provides adequate grounds upon which to base such an

exemption.

In addition, portions of documents 4, 5, 6 and

8 relating

to one individual

exempt pursuant to 5 U.S. C. $552(b) (6)

due to

certain unique circumstances

involved. I have determined

that disclosure would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion

of personal

privacy," for this individual.

With the exception of the one document released in its

entirety

and the portions of the other documents that were

released, I found

the matter

covered by your request clearly

within

the statutory protection and exemptions cited

above.

proper protection

classified information and intelligence

sources and methods requires a denial of the remaining portions

of the documents.

Finally four documents originated by Congress, one of

which

was a Memorandum

of Understanding between the House

Select Committee on Assassinations and the Office of the

Secretary of Defense and attached

to document 5, were

found

not to be agency records and

are therefore not subject to the

Freedom of Information Act. Possession of a document does not

dictate that it is an

"agency record" but rather whether control

of the document has passed from Congress and become property of

the agency within which it resides.

See Goland v. CIA, 607 F.2d

339 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 927 (1980). As you

already know, when the House Select Committee on Assassinations

disbanded, Chairman Stokes informed

former Attorney General

Griffin Bell that the Congressional

materials and related

information connected to the Committee should be held in

confidentiality.

That assertion of Congressional privilege

has been recently reaffirmed

by the Congress.

They will explore means of determining this

all mation to include the possibility of having sgt. stevenson

mand ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicate

his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this

request would have to be examined at policy level

within DoD).

If the Committee is able to determine a specific name,

the staffers indicated that they would probably initiate a specific

inquiry to NSA to again search our materials.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

28 November 1978

SUBJECT: Visit to House Select Committee on Assassinations

• On 21 November I visited House Select Committee on Assassinations

spaces to review for classification purposes the report Messrs Cornwell

and Klein wrote following the 17 November interview with Sgt Nicholas B.

Stevenson, USAF.

The report, about one and a half pages long, listed the participants

in the interview and described generally the substance of the discussions:

Although it did not mention the specific site to which Sgt Stevenson and

assigned, it did say that the facility was able t

u. The report further

mentioned f

and "NSA" in several places.

3 ..

I told Mr. Cornwell that as written, portions of the report should

be classified "CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY."

He agreed

to classify it and asked me to mark it which I did. I suggested that with

a few changes we could make it unclassified. Mr. Cornwell stated that he

would prefer to retain the original language of the report at this time

but that if it was to be used in any unclassified report by the Committee,

he would then ask us to review the wording so that classified information

would not be disclosed.

Mr. Cornwell asked if NSA had determined whether the conversation

we ferenced had been published and disseminated in product

channels. I told him that we had not yet determined the answer to that

question and that we would be back in touch.
