in an apartment building adjacent to the Armory Lounge,

GIANCANA, however, knows him by sight. She has been in a
position to observe and furnish the identities of automobile
license numbers in and near the Armory Lounge. YW.

CG T-31 is PCI HENRY H. HODL, who until recently
was employed as card dealer and "lookout" at the Riviera
Lounge, Niles, Illinois, which is an operation of GIANCANA
through his lieutenant, ROCCO POTENZO. He has been extremely
reluctant to furnish information; however, that which he has
furnished has proved to be reliable. \\

CG T-36 is a former PCI who was employed in the
kitchen of MEO's Norwood House Restaurant, a one time hoodlum
hangout. His whereabouts are now unknown.\\

CG T-37 is former PCI MICHAEL GALLAGHER, who at
one time was employed by MEO's, Villa Venice Restaurant,
Wheeling, Illinois. The information he furnished, although
limited, was considered to be reliable. W

CG T-50 is former PCI TONY HORTON, a Chicago
Bondsman, Negro, who was in a position to furnish information
relating to the activities of another Bondsman; IRVING WEINER,
known to be closely associated with the hoodlum element.
His information was known to be very reliable.y,

CG T-68 is PCI GERARD C. "HAT" MURRAY, an old
time Chicago bookmaker who was recently severely beaten by
Syndicate hoodlums in what turned out to be a successful
attempt to bring him into the "syndicate" regarding his book-
making activities, Although he is still a current PCI, the
fact that he has "gone to the other side" makes his current
reliability questionable, although the information he furnished
proved to be reliable.

CG T-70 is PCI BENJAMIN JULIUS HIRSCH, an old time
Chicago confidence man who has a long record of arrests for
larceny, forgery, etc. He was in an excellent position to
furnish information regarding bookmaking wire services, and

in a pending inactive status until recently in view of a Civil
Suit which HIRSCH brought for false arrest from a Bureau appre-
hension in 1953. Ww ~
