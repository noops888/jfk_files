pressure off Venozuela. Subject way alee instructed to bring absat better

and ecansel ageinst letting doctrine replacs action, The tape clearly
reveals RICO te be at once a very intellectual leftist wie also has his

feet pleated quite firaly on the ground. His approach is praguatic, not
theorstiesl. The text of the tape indicates that it was made soxotine

after February and before mid-October 1961.

There is little at hand to indicate what manner of man is RICO Calan.
His 201 file reflects facts but not impressions. He apparently is know
personally by LICOOKY<1 and LITAHIL~9 in Hexieo City, and these teo
sourees should be queried.

1. (Summary: Popular Socialist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the
arrest of Victor Rico Galan and others on charges of conspiring
sestnet the Government remain unsympathetic and the Party
intends to stay outside the entire matter although PPS Sec-
retary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano may seize the oppor-
tuntty to strike back at some of his enemies by issuing a
atatenent condemning the plans attributed to Rico Galan,
Within the Party there ie considerable akopticism about the
truth of tho published charges. While several Party leaders
do not doubt that there is sose truth to the charges they aro
quite cenvinced that there was no danger of imminent rebollion
and that Mexican inetitutions atcod in no peril trom Rico
Galan end his friends, Given the energy and efficiency with
which the Kexican Government hes dealt with leas melodramatic

Victor Rico Galan ond bis easociates can expect neither syn-
pethy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido
Popular Socialints). Although no official decision haa yet

been made by the Prrty, PPS iesdors who have commented un-  -
officially on the natter have said that for the momont the
Party vill no doubt stay completely outside the whole effeir,
thus proving ita total inck of interest in this type of revo-
lutionary activity,. It 1a of course possible that PPS Secretary
General Vicente Lombardo Toledano will seize tho opportunity to
issue o statemont condemning tho entire aftsir as Trotskyist,
criminal, and utopian, Lomberdo may decide to uso this oppor=
tunity to strike beck at tho National Liberation Movement
(MLN - Hovisionto do Liberacion Rac amanee and others who have

attackod hin.

Among leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers
and Peasants of Hexico (UGOCM - Union General de Obreros. y
Campesinos de Mexico), there is 6 certsin skepticisa about the
truth of the matter as it haa been presented in the press,

It is probably true that arms and materials for manufacturing
explosives were confiscated. It is probably true that indoc-
trination sessions’ on political and rovolutionary matters
probably were held in the houses where the arrests were made.
And probably the group did have some kind of plan for action.
But, it 18 Simply not true that there was the alightest danger
of inmediate ‘and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his

friends,

This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan

is no guerrille leader, He ig an aggrossive intellectual, a
radical, but he is not in jail for what he hog done but for

his ideas. As for‘Roul Ugal Alvarez, named with Rico Galan

as one of the leaders of the group, he has the reputation of
being fuzzy-minded, a leftist advonturer and certainly neither
brave nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Galan is well aware

of this, popular support is essential to the euccess of rebellion.
None exists. The peamants are divided. The workers are controlled
by tho Governnent, and the middle-clans ts content with tho way
things are, Also, there is the formidable precedent of Govorn-
ment action against any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed,
and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected.

“The Governnent has always moved with energy, speed, and effi-

ciency to combat such threate as, for oxample, during the
Railway Workers Strike of 1959, Several leaders of that atrike
are still in jail and likely to remain there, Anothor example
is the September 1065 attack on a military camp at Ciudad Madera,
Chihuahia, Whilo the Governnent did not feel that his incident
posed any real. threat to it, it did not want the bad interna~
tional publicity, so vigilance was increased, activities of
would-bo guerrillas were blocked, some wore bought off with
money, othors with prowises and the astter was promptly and
efficiently controlled.

There no doubt 1s a degree of truth to police charges, but

the melodramatic, slucst childish character given to the Rico
Galan movement, the lack of any proven connection between the
movesent and joftist/Communist organizations, Rico Gvlan's
open sad woll-Xnown connections with Guatemalan guerrilla
leaders and his public support of the Cuban revolution, make
4% vory hard to discount tho suspicion that thie ies simply a
Government asnouver. Also, while the police no doubt did
confiscate orss snd other materials, the muspicion exists that
the police have inflated their role in order to uske theaselves
leok goud both to the President and to public opinion.

There ig oven a rumor that because of Rico Galen's harsh attacks
on the new Guatomalan administration, the Guatenslan Governnent
asked the Mexican Governuent to desl with Rico Galan, This
rumor howover ia regarded oa rather ridiculous since the
Mexican Government certainly cares Medea for the opinion

of Guatemalan offictala.

LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVE AT

NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED soup HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO CUBA.)

to tho Mexican Foreign Office orally. The Expassy was later |
informed that Mascaro had been deported to Venezuela for
violations of the Mexican immigration law

Mascaro was a key contact of Victor/yi{co Glan, Spanish-born

preoccupation with problems in Vietnam, the Dominican Republic
and elsewhere, proved that Johnson had come to deal with
matters of great importance to him ond to Mexicnh Prosidont
Gustavo Diaz Ordaz., Or, he added, was it that Jphnson had
come to give instructions, or orders, to continue hia policy
of oppression of the pooplo, in this instance Moxico.

Calderon criticized sharply the Mexican Governmgnt for its
methods in organizing the olaborate reception for President
Johnson, The system of hording together the populace is
accomplished, among othor means, through threats mado by

union leaders. to workors that they will lose a Way's pay or
suffer other losses if thoy do not participate in welcoming
ceremonies, Calderon donounced officials of the Ministry

ef Foreign Relations for having remained silent in tho face

of a proposal by Socrotary of State Doan Rusk for tho creation
of an international police force - "the type of gecurity

forcé that has in‘the past protected countries from North
American aggression",

Again on 28 April tho MLN hold.a meeting in observance of
Dominican Week, this one attended by approximately twenty-
five persons. It was announced at the last moment that the
journalist Alberto Domingo, who was to have attended tho
meeting, would not be present because of a moro pressing
engagement. In his absence Armando Castillejos Ortiz .

and the poctosa Normn Carrasco improvised a program. Castillejos -

expressed reuret. that the’MLN does not possess adoquato
publishing fncilitivs to keep tho Mexican public informed

of the existing situation in the Dominican Republic. Ho
recommended that those present take advantage of every oppor=
tunity, io their places of work and at gatherings elsewhere,
to disseminate by word of mouth the facts of North American
domination over the weaker nutions of the world, io noted
that ninety percont of the citizens of the United States

are not in accord with U.S. foreign policy.

Norma Carrasco's contribution to the mecting consisted of
the reading of pootry which sho had composed depicting the
United Statos' invasion of the Dominican Republic,

ACTION REQUIRED s

1, On 13 January 1966 a Mexico. City newspaper, El Heraldo, published an artiole
which oited a taped specoh by Victor Rico Galan to Yon-Sosa’s guerrilles
as evidence of Rico Galon's efforts to undermine the Janmary 156 visit of
Mexioan President Diaz Ordaz to Guatemala, A copy of. this article is
attached, The taped speech mentioned in the article 19 otvicusly thst which
Guatemalan authorities captured fro@ Yon Soza's guerrillas in October 1964
following a guerrilla attack on Guatemalan military garrison, This tape
was subsequently made available to-KUEARK and was passod vin the Guatemala
Station to Mexico City Station for posaible exploitation in Mazico, The
content of the taped speech was later passed to President Disz Ordaz by
C08, Mexico City, with a view to stimulating prescure toward Rico Galen's
expuloion from Mexico ae an undesirable alten, How El Heralio obtained «
or got word of the taped apeech 1s not known, Since the Fl Heraldo article
was pegged to the current trip to Guatemala of President Diez Orcaz, it is
very probable that the expose was stimulated directly by the Prenidensy, in
lino with a GoM campaign to neutralize all existing and potential opposition

locally to the Presidential trip,

In a sharp rebuttal in the 26 January 1966 iemue of the prominent Psxican

r
Victor Rico Galan was born 6 Fobruary 1928 in El Ferrol, Syain, He is

Spanieh by birth, bocame a Mexican citizen by naturalization in March 1949.

Ho ia married to Ingeborg Dienar de Rico Galan, born 11 May 1929 in Med co

City.. Ho reaidos at Ernostina Larrainzar 19-B, Col, del Valle in Mexico City.

He'writes for both Sempra, Mexico City leftict newe-wackly, and Politica,

VRG foportedly talked to Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1961 regarding
the formation of the Moyimianto de Liberacion Nag: (MLN) {n Mexdeo,

With thoir approval he became one of the founding members of the MLN and
later headed tha MLN Preas and Propaganda Committes, Ina speech to tho
MLN in April 1962 he stated, ‘Tho governmeat must ba made to understand that
only the people have the right te violence," (Thie was in reference to the

Mexican govornmont repression of the Cormunist Party and ite arrect of
David Alvaro Siquiores.)

In an articla in Slempre in March 1983 VAG advocated the formation of a
new palitical party reflocting thy ideology of Genaral Lazaro Cardeaas, former
Preaidont of Mexico. .VRG eaid thia new political party waa naeded to traly
ropresent the radical tendencles of the 1910 revolution. VRC conceived this new
party ae the political arm of tho recently-formed MLN, which could iiss develop

inte a bread national pro-Communist movement liko the FRAP in Chile,

VRG has always been very close ond oympathotte to the Castre-Cuhan
revolution, In 1961 he was a member of the Pertodisias Mexicanos Amigos da
Guts, Alao in 1961 he was veportad to be a member of the Garnmities for

- Solidarity with the Cuban Rovelution, Ia March 1942 ha was reportedly a
member of a group of four pro-Castroites who made an abortive physical attack

of Fidel Castro, In an article written for Siempre while he waa in Cuba
(Sigmpre 31 Oct 62) be extols tho grost Cuban revolution and the advantages
Castroism has brought to the lowor classes. Ina later article (Siempre

14 Nov 62) he attacke the Soviet Union and Khrushchev for their weakness during
tho Cuban missile crisis, Ho refers to Fidel Castro ae being the vanguard of
the revolution against Colonialiem,

From late.May to mid Juno 1963 VRG was again in Cuba, thie time to
interview Fidel Castro following tho latter's return (rom the Seviet Union,
YRG reportedly spent 8 days with Fidel Caétro, five of thin aboard the Cuban
leados's yacht, and also interviewed other Cuban leaders, including Blas Roca,
Sacrotary-Genoral of the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP + Cuban Communist
Party); Ernesto "Cha" Guevara Serna, Minletor of Industries; Oswaldo
Dorticos Torrado, Cuban President; and Raul Roa Garcia, Minister of Foraign

Rolations,

Tt was during this May-June 1963 contact with Fidol Castro and other Cuban
leaders that VRG recaived a major operational assignment. He was given the
miasion of traveling through Central acd South America to contact lacal
Comroanfot and guerrilla leaders, His job was to persuade these groups to begin
campaigno of violence and terror immediately in order to take the proasure off
the FALH fa Venesuela, hove program of terror, heavily subsidized by Castro,
was beginaing to run inte increased zesistance from the Veneauslan goverment
forces, On this trip VAG alao had the missioa of bringing about greater unity
among the varicua Cammunist and terroristic groupa.

In lato 1963 VRG undertook his assigned mission, He traveled to Panama,
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Venesuela, Nicavagua and Brasil aod contacted key
Comricaiests in each of theea countrias,

Among the Com:nualst leadeta which VRG contacted an this trip were
Hugo Yictor, Proaldont of the Partido de! Pyuoblo (PDP - People's Party,
a Communist group) and David Turner, a leader of t ard of National
Agtign (VAN - a pro-Cuban, radical revolutionazy organisation) in Panama:
Gomes Ayay, 8 guerrilla leader in Gaaterals; and Francisco juliao, the

_ tevolutionazy peasant leader, {n Brasil,

in Nicaragua VRG :nat several times with Alvaro Ramirea Gonzales,
Secrotary-Ganoral of the Moyilizacion Rapublicana (MR ~ Cowununtet Political
Frond who was also 5 member of the Central Cammittes af tho
in Nicaragua (PSN), the Nicaraguan Communiet Party, VAC's

Ramiron was givon considerable radio and press publicity in Nicaragua, The
prove referred to "aecret meetings" in VRG's hotel room betwen Ramirez
and VRG, Ramires-anewered by writing letters to the newopapers, saying he
met VRG quite openly in his office and that VRG had called on him because ho
{VRG) wan a logitimate journalist who was scoking interviews with various
political figures, On 24 October Ramirez was interviewed on radio and
finally reluctantly admitted that he had gone to VRG's hotel room, He oaid
hie purpose in going there was to take VRG to his (Ramirez's) office.

tm Panama VRG stayed at the Hotel International. While in Panama he
visited US installations and was seen taking many pictures, Ile talke with
Hugo Victor and David Turner wore aimed at getting the VAN and the PDP to
resolve their differences and to unite. Turner briefed VRG on VAN's preparations
to establish an armed movement in Panama, Victor, on the other hand,
opurnod VRG'a to unify the two groups.

Following thie trip In late 1963, VRG returned to Cuba (in January 19841)
aad visited Fidel Castro again and to report on the results of hia contacts with
Central and Latin American Comzountst leadors.

In late March 1965 VRG (with hia wifo) again traveled to Crba to coport
to Cubasi leaders, He raturned to Mexico in aarly April 1965.

In May 1964 VRG was invited to visit Red China, ostensibly as a gueat of
the All-China Journalisto Association, which indicated it would be willing to
pay all costs, including transportation, Because of other pressing work In
connaction with hid assignmante on bekalf of Castro, VRG did not accept this

invitation,

Over tho years 1961 to 1965 VRG's contacts with tho Cuban Enmibaasy in
Mexico City have incroased stuadily. He meets frequently and regularly with
various officials of the Cuban Embassy, asually at his horne, at the Sigmpra
offices or at ths hames of the Cuban officials ia Mexice City.

Hip moot frequent contact io with Manuel Eugenio Vega Peron, Third
Secretary of the Cuban Embaesy and chiof representative of the Dirrecion General
da Intoligeacia (DGI - Cuban Intelligence Service) in Moxico, Obese and outwardly
jolly, Yoga Pores waa the driver of a beer truck in Havana prior to the Cuban
Revolution which launched him on his intelligence caraor.

fe,



“4°

Another VRG Cuban intelligence contact is Ramon Sinobas Casado, Counselor
of the Cuban Embassy, Sinobas is Voga's assistant in'handling" VRG. It is
apparent that these contacts are primarily for the purpose of channeling VRG's
reports and inotructions to and from Cuba. In the course of hie work as an
agent for Castro and the DGI, VRG {s known to have acted as a courier, carrying
material and large sums of money to pro-Cuban groups in Central and Latin
American countries,

In October 1964 VRG received another important asaignment fram hie
Cuban masters. VRG was requested to travel to Guatomala to make a personal
survey of the atrength and weaknesses of Marco Antonio Yon Svea's guerrilla
forces and to lay the basis for a more energetic implemontation in Guatemala
of the tactical principles for guorrilla warfare laid down by "Ghe" Guevara,
This was, in effect, a follow-up to his oarller vicit to Yon Sosa during his
swing through Contrat American countries in late 1963, At that time, VRG
atternpted to perouade Yon Sosa to align himself more closely with Castro's
objectives in Latin America, The rosulte of thie visit to Guatemala were
written ap by VRG ina special report to Castro, VRG's conclusions at that
tine were not complately favorable to Castro,

Yon Sosa is known to do a forceful and {ndopendent guerrilla loader who
prides himself on his ability to maintain aimeelf and bin followers independantly
of ideological gadance from either Havana, Paking or Moscow, although he le
quite willing to accept arma and financial support from any of these Communist
capitals. Inthe past Castro's efforte to bring Yon Sosa te hoel have bean
thwarted mainly by tha iniluance tha Chinose Communists have bean able to
exert over the Guatemalan guerrilia leader, In addition to the direct aid EA
provided by Peking to Yon So his guerrillas in Northaastern Guatomala, :
thore ie the fact of Yon Sova's Chinase background (Yon Soaa'a father was
Chinese) which has sazved to tle him emotlonally to the Red Chinave.

It wap the continuing recalcitrant attitude of Yon Suwa which apparently
prompted VRG'a second misoion ta Guatemala in October of 1964. VRG was
inatructed not only to talk to Yon Sosa but also ta try to influency Yon Sosa's
gaererilla forcea directly in line with Castro's objectives. In addition to prapared
matarial which VRG uaed for locturing the guerrillas he brought with him special
propaganda filma for indoctrination purposes,

In late October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured 9 number of tape
recordings from Yon Sosa's guerrillas following a guerrilla attack on a government



garrison, Included in these tapes waa one made by VRG for delivary to the
guerrillas during hic carly October vioit with thom, A copy of this tapo is
attached, The tape concists mainly of an oxhortation by VRG for unity (between
the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT) and the 13 November Group)

and 4 plea not to permit ideological arguments to replace action, In this epeech
VRG reveals himself to be a hard-headed revolutionary activist, not merely an
intellectual loftiot, His approach to revolution is completely practical, not the >

oretical,

To cover hio miesion as a Castro political action agent to Yon Sosa, VRG
later published aa "interview" with the latter (in Stamprg No. 593, 4 November

1964).

YRG'o involvement in the recent Dominican crisis io the latest example of
his work on behalf of Castro. In varly January 1944 VRC travalled to Santo
Domingo, returning a week lator to Mexico, Ostensthly this trip wae to report
on Dorninican Kopublic affairs for Slamprg, Actually this was morely 8 cover
for a Communist propaganda assignment, Shortly after VIG left Santo Domingo,
thounanda of copies of a pro-Cuatro brochure, entitled "Gieaprg visita lo
Dominicana" ant signed VRG, wore dietriimted among Cornrauniote and
Communist sympathizers in the Dominican Republic, A copy of thia brochure

iy attached,

During hie January 1964 tsip VAG contacted both the Moviraiento Popular
Rominicans (MPD), a terroristic revolutionary Marxist-Leninist and etrong
pro~Chicom group, and the 14th of Juna Movement, the Agrupacton Politica
Gatorca de Junio (APCJ), a militant, revolutionary pro-Castro group. Hie
contact with the MPD resulted in his furn{shing matarial to the subversive
But his principal contact, ona that developed
rapidly into a very active relationship in the period proceding the Dominican
eriaia, wae with Juan B, Majia, leader/of the APCJ, These two have maintaine:
eloso and {roquent contact over the past year, Durlag the Dominican crisis VRG
sarved aa A relay point for material and inetructions from Cuba to the APCI
and also acted a@ 4 reporting channel from Mejia to the DGI and tha APCJ'a

Castro-Cuban laadership in Cuba,

' Ag dn previous operations of thio xind, VG cloaked his relationship
with Mojia under a journaliotic cover, An "Iintarview" he conductad with Mejia
appoared in tha 2 May 1965 iseue of the Cuban aewopaper Moy, A copy of
tho text of that article fe attached,



In mid-May 1965 a gaffo by Mojia's and VRG's Cuban superiors exposed the
Mejia-VRG-Cuba channel publicly, In an article carried by Porto Alogre
(Brasil) nowopaper Gorreio do Povo on 20 May, datalined New York 19 May
by Louls Wisniaer, a Radio Havana broadcast of 19 May was reported to have
mentioned a declaration by Juan Mojia sent from Santo Domingo to VRG in Mexico,
who then sent the declaration to Radio Havana, After citing this channel by
which it received the Mejia statement, Radio Havana proceeded to broadcaet
the following excerpte from the declaration: "Numerous leaders of the 14 June
Party have disappeared but I (Majia) know that they are now in the mountain
leading guerrillas, The 14 June Party haa control of the situation in Santo
Domingo," The Correio do Povg noted editorially that the Radio Havana broadcast
seeme to negate the Castro effort to deny that the l4th June Movement in the
Dominican Republic is tled to him, The article concludes by noting that Mejia
was one of the 53 Cocumunists Usted by the Americana, and that thin confession
by Havana puts new Hight on the quastioa of American intorvention in the
Dominican Republic, Not noted iz the article is the fact that YXG's role as
an intermediary betwaen Mojia and Castro ie claarly exposed by the Radio
Havana broadcast. A copy of tha Correia do Povo article fo attached.

When the Dorminican rebalilon erupted VRG began to agitate with the Slampre,
staff for outright and total suppert to the pro-Castwo forces in the rabel camp,
Those offorts began to bear fruit whea VAG was sllowed to parsonally brief and
dispatch a Slampre cérreepwndant~photograpier team to the Dominican Republic
in early May 1965 to repore on tha crisia, The correagondent waa Luis Suarez
Lopoz; the photographer waa Lais Redrigo Moya Mozono, ‘tha resulting articles
in Siempre produced by this VRG-Suaron-Moya team ware violently anti-US and
pro-Castro Communiat in thely intoyprotation of the crisis -~ 80 much so that

- thay apparently touched off a bitter dispute betweos VRG and Jove Pagan Liergo,

Sempre director, who prefers to sich to the traditional Siempre role of a
peoudo-indopendant outlet for a variety of le(tist causes. VRG's afiorts to
reorient Siempra along more militant pro~Gomuaantat Mnes

naa long been

“kaown in journalistic circles in Moxico and the Suaxes-Moye Incident appara

to have precipitated an open fight between the two, WRC ia apparently aiming
for a showdown with Pages Liergo over this (asus, since several Siempre
writers are known to Ia ve been individually approached by VRG over the past
woeko to onllot thoir support against tho pravent Slenipz9 editorial policy,
which VRG regards aa too “opportuniatic,'

2, The following information was obtained:

: : Doninioan Republic. During the briefing by tho MY representative
‘ on 1, Maye It neo neroed that 4/1 Would attenst to have tho Havana broadeast
: of 2 Hay replayed through hie friond.Haure LUCINTINI of ANSA, New York, It”
: woe felt that thie approach would be more desirable than using ¥/1 _Girectdy,
: dn view of his offorts to appear as a liberal journalist. During the
meeting ¥/1 attempted to contact Lucentini, but ascertained that he had gone
eff on a holiday for the weekend, Upon learning that Lucentini would return
to Bow York City during the evening of 16 stay, it was agresd that ¥/1 would
eontaot hin at that tine in an effort to have tho story tranuaitted on 17
May.’ In addition to the major.capitals in Latin America, ¥/1.also thought

that the story would be sent to Rome.

b, Following a ‘phone call from the KH Desk, KUTHENYOQED subsequently
briofed 4/1 on the fact that the sano etery lad heen carried dn the 2 Hay
edition of Hoy in Havana, (UOENT: KUTIREFORD pointed out to the Head=
quarters rep that, da his opinion, At migit not be advisable to inform
Lucentini of the Hoy article ds it might raise an objection in his mind cone
coming the current valus of the nam.)

6%, Briefei on toth tho radio broadeact and the joy artiole, b/1
was disinclined to muntion the Hoy article vo Lucentink for the sano
objection noted atove, fie was ingtructed to uso Is om diacrotion,

ad. th the evening of 16 May %/1 contacted Leential amt outlined his
roquost. He explained to lacentini that this was a good opportunity for
a so60p on a het dtea, 4/1, in orler to offset any objections on the part
of iasontini, tald him that the radio -oroadzast. had urred on 13 Hay.
He did not mention the Hoy mtisle, According wo u/1, Lecsatint was lose
than enthustastie about trvisalttdng the story throwh his facilities,
pointing out that tt was no longer news. After somo persuasion, aecording
to b/1, Lucentint finally ayrwai te cond the fojloving atkreviated story
to Busnes Alres either the ovening of 15 hay or early 17 Hay!

"Qn Friday, vay 13, hadlo-Havans cited Juan 2, Majia leader of
imainican '14 of Juno’ party who bad given an intorview to Mexican
Jownslist Victor Lico Galan in vhich ho declared over the talephone that
'meny leaders of the June 1, novesent have disappeared, but at the sang
tine nierouw contingents of insurgents aro reported in the mountains of

‘Xt appears that in Washington. they are thinking of converting Santo
Domingo ina Fideicoaiso.' Then he commented ironically, 30 "we get

out of colonialiam into independence.” VG says that this is of course
very grave. Ag F. knows these sre 2 oc 3 Jeft in the world - of
Pideiconigog ~ in Southern Afsica, This would be unprecedented case -
that they convert an independent countsy into a country under Fidel~
comizo (Pxrotectorates). When Mejia kicart asked if they (U.S.) want
to convert "ua into a colony." BSogch replied. that - Yes, into a colony
but with 253,000 armed gen, Civilians, of course, Bosch further anid
that “shat the people had done was some thing extfacdsinary and tat he

1. The Mexico City Station has been requested by the
Press Office of the Embassy to assist in. briefing Mr. Robert
Struthers, a roving reporter of the Reader's Digest, who is
preparing an article on Cuban/Communist supversion in Latin
Ancrica and who has expressed displeasure that‘ the Embassy
has been undble to provide any bricfing on Communist activi-
ties in Mexico and Central America,

2. Mexico City Station and WH Division feel that par-
ticularly since the Spanish edition of the Reader's Digest
has a circulation of over two and one-half million copies,
this is an excellent avenue for the otherwise planned sur-
facing of abundant information (including the existence of
a tape recorded speech to Guatemalan guerrillas, recently
captured) on Victor RICO Galan, an active Cuban agent and

@ regular contributer of the weekly leftist magazine,

ca the activities of Victor RiCO Galan
and a replay of the tape has already been civen officially
in Guatemala during the January meeting ef the Security
Ministers of Central America. No press play has yet been
nade.
