Although no official decision has yet

boon made by the party, PPS lendors who havo commented un-

offically on the matter havo sald that for the momont the

Party v1ll no doubt stay coupletoly outaldo the shole sifair,

thus proving ita total lack of intorost in thin type of rovo-

attachod hia.

and Peasante of Mexico (UGOCH - Union General de Obreros. y

Camposipos de Moxico), thore 1e a certain skoptician about the

truth of the matter as lt has been presented in the press.

It In probably true that arms and materials for manufacturing

explosives vere confiscated.

It is probably true that indoc

sessions on political and rovolutionary matters

probably were held In thy housed where the arrests

And probably the croup did have some kind of plan for action.

But, it le simply not true that there was the slightest danger

of immodiate and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his

Irlends.

4.

This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan

Is no guerrilla leader.

He is an aggrossive Intollectual, a

radical, but he is not in jall for what he hos done but for

hls Ideas.

As for Raul Usalde Alvarez, named with Rico Galan

as one of the leaders of the group, he has the reputation of

beink luzzy-mindod, a leftiat adventurer and cortainly nolther

brave

nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Calan 1e vell aware

of thia, popular support is essential to the success of rebollion.

Nono oxists. The peasants are divided. The workers are controlled

by the Governant, and the middle clans is content with the way

things aro. Also,

there is the fornidable precedent of Govern-

ment action against any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed,

and particularly any sort of activlty which is Cuban-conected.

The Covornont has always moved with enorty, apoed, and offl

Clency to combat such threate as, for oxample,

during the

Rallay Workore Strike of 1959.

Beveral lendors of thet atrizo

aso st11l in Jall and likely to remain thoro.

Anothor enample

do the Boptember 1065 attack on a niiitary camp at Cludad Madore,

Chthunhua. While the Government did not feel that his Incident

posed any roal, threst io 1t, it did not want the bad interna

tlonal publicity, so viellance was increased, activities of

rould-bo guerrillas sore blocked, sono vere bought off with

mondy, others with prouises and the utter man promptly and

efficiently controlled.

Thoro no doubt 18 a dogroe of truth to police charges, but

the melodramntic, aloost childish character siren to the Rico

Galan

moverent,

tho lack of any proven connection botecon the

movesent and deftlet Coruntat organizationa, Rico Clan'a

onen ond volt-ssorn connections vith Guatennian ruerrilla

loadora and his public support of tho Cuban revolution, mato

1i vory hard to discount the suspicion that thie is simply s

Government nanourer.

Also, while the police no doubt did

contiacate arms and other

naterials, the suspicion oslate that

the polico have inflated their role in ordor to made Chesselves

100k poud sota to the president and so puble opinion.

AMONG THEM, (SOURCE COMMENT: IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR CUBANA TO

: ASKED WHY HE DID NOT DO MORE IN CULTURAL PRESS WORK FOR CUBA, LOPEZ

REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS

ASSISTING THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN MEXICO, (SOURCE COMMENT:

LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVE AT

THE CUBAN EMBASSY, SINCE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND AP-

PEARED TO FEEL THAT THE MEXICANS CONNECTED WITH THE CASE WHO HAD

NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO CUBA.)

L. PRELIMINGRY RESULIS OF AN INVESTIGATION BY MEXICAN

SECURITY OFFICIALS OF THE 14 AUGUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE IN THE

PEMEX REFINERY AT POZA RICA, VERACRUZ, HAVE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE

TO INDICATE DHO MIGNI BE RESPONSIDLE FOR THE EXPLOSION.

INVESTIGATION IS HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT SECURITY PRE-

CAUTIONS AT THE REFLUERY ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. AT THE :

TIME OF THE EXPLOSION OULY ONE GATE GUARD AND TWO SOLDIERS

WERE ON DUTY IN THE ENTIRE PLANT.

ZO THE CONDITION OF THE SECTION OF THE GAS TRANSMISSION

LINE WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION OCCURED INDICATES THAT THE

LINE WAS RUPTURED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPLOSION SINCE THE EDGES OF

THE PIPE AT THE POINT OF RUPTURE WERE TURNED INWARD.

3. THE EXPLOSION OCCURED AT A TIME WHEN MAXIMUM PROPERTY

DAMAGE AND MINIMUM LOSS OF LIFE WERE ASSURED. (SOURCE COMMENT:

HAD THE BLAST AND FIRE OCCURED DURING THE WORK WEEK IT IS PROBABLE

THAT AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED PERSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.)

4, ESOURCE COMMENT: THE CONDITION OF THE PIPE LINE AND

THE TIMING OF THE EXPLOSION STRONGLY SUGGEST SABOTAGE. ALSO,

THE DAMAGE IS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE PRESS HAS INDICATED

AVD IT WILL PROBABLY TAXE MUCH LONGER TO GET THE REFINERY BACK -

IN OPERATION THAN HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. RESERVES ARE BEING USED

NOW TO PREVENT A GASOLINE SHORTAGE.)

survey of the strength and weaknesses of Marco Antonio Yon Soea's guerrilla

forces and to lay the basis for a more energetic Implemontation in Guatemala

of the tactical principles for guerrilla warfare laid down by "Che" Guevara.

This was, In effect, a follow-up to his varliar vioit to Yon Soon during his

swing through Contral American countries in late 1963. At that timo, VRG

atterpiod to paroundo Yon Sosa to allen himself more closaly with Castro's

objactivos in Antin America. The rosulto of thia viole to Guaterala vero

written an by VRG in a spectal raport to Gastro, VRC's conclusione at that

tirno more not completely favorable lo cartro,

Yon Sosa is knoun to bo a forcoful and Indopendant guerrilla loader who

prides himself on his ability to maintain hiineoli and his followera indopendantly

of ideological pedance from sither Havana, Pakiug or Moacow, although he la

quito willing to accept arms ani financial support from any of these Communiat

capitals. In tha gist Castro's elforto to bring Yon Sona to hoel hava boas

thwarted malaly by cha incluonce the Chinosa Communists have bean able to

exert over the Guaterialan guerrlila leadar. In addition to the direct aid

providod by Paking to Yon Soda aad his guerrillas in Northaadiora Gualomali,

thore da the faci of Yon Soon'a Chinose background (Yon Sosa'a father sas

Chinese) which has sorved to tie him emotlonally to the Red Chinese.

It was the continuing recalcitrant atitudo di Xon Sona which appareutly

prompled VRG'a second inision to Guatemala in October of 1964. VRG was

inatructad not only to sals lo Yon Sosa but also to try to Influenco Yon 5033'e

guan rilla forcas directly la line with Castro's objectivor.

In addition to prapared

matartal which VRG aded log locturing the guerrillas he brought with him special

Included in these tapes was ono made by VRG for delivery to the

guerrillas during his oarly October viole wilh them. A copy of thia tapo la

attached. The tape constate mainly of an oxhortation by VRG for unity (between

tho Perildo Guatemaltoco del Trabale (PGT) and the 13 November Group)

and a plas not to permit ideological argumants to replaco action. In this speech

VRG reveala himsell to be a hard-headed rovolutionary activiot, not merely an

Intellectual loitiot, His approach to revolation is completely prnctical, not the -

oretical.

•To cover bio miesion as a Castro political action agent to Yon Soes, VRG

later publiohad an "interview" with the latter (in Slampre No. 593, 4 November

1961).

VAG'a Involvemont in lho recent Dominican erisis lo the latent example of

his work on behall of Castro.

In carly January 1964 VR& travelled to Santo

Domingo, returning a week lator to Moxico. Ontonathly this trip pao to report

on Dominican Ropublic affairs for Stampss, Actually this was moraly a cover

Dominienna" and aigned VRO, vore dlutribnted among Communlats and

Communist sympathizors in the Dominican Remiblie. A copy of this brochure

Durior his January 1964 4i0 VRG contacted both the Moviratanto Popular

Pominicane (MPD), a torsortalie revolutionary Marxtel-Lendalot and etrong

pro-Chicom group, and the 14th of June Movement, the Agrupacion Folltica

Calorco de Junto (APC)), a pulitant, revolullonary pro-Castro group. Hia

contact with the MPD rosulted in bla furninhing material to the subverolve

MPD publscasion, Liborzad,

But hia principal contact, one that developed

rapidly into a very active relationahip in tho parled proceding the Dominican

crlota, was with Juan B. Mojia, leador of the AFC!, Those two have maintrina:

closo and iroquent contret ovor the post yoar. During tie Dominican criede VRG

carved no a zolay point for matorial and inotructions from Cuba to the APCI

and also setad as a roportiay channol from Moja to the DGI and the APCJa

As do previous oporatone ol thia klad, VAG cloaked his relationshin

with Molla ander a journaliotic cover, An 'Intarvios" he conductad with Moja
