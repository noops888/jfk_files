an international organizer for the Teamsters Union.

Kavner was

reported to be a

sick man who wants to leave the Teamsters Union

but Hoffa does not trust lavner and will not let him go.

Kavner

reportedly is in Mayo Clinic at the present time and the source

feels that Kavner may be "ripe" for intensilied inquiry.

According to the informant Earl Scheib has been paying

Doria regularly during the life of a

"sweetheart" contract.

reportedly spends every day at the race track and every night

Scheib

getting drunk at the Del Monico Restaurant, 828 South Robertson

Boulevard, Los Angeles; which Scheib also owns. Scheib allegedly

loses a lot of money gambling and the informant believes that payofis

to Doria may be covered in this fashion.

The Bureau has opened a new case, captioned the same

as this airtel, with los Angeles as origin and the field should do

likewise®

A full and complete investigation concerning all of the

afore-mentioned items should be initiated immediately.

LoS Angeles should immediately reinterview the informant

to obtain further specifics concerning all of the above mentioned

matters with particular emphasis on ascertaining, 11 possible,

his sources and any evidence that might zerist which will establish

that these allegations are true.

Criminal Division, which should be forwarded to the Bureau by cover

airtel.

The identity of the informant should be concealed therein

and; of course, he should not be referred to as "Clip."

completo and thorough in all respects

The field should conduct

all logical investigation to determine the veracity of this

infornation..

It is pointed out that through imaginative and

probative

investigation it may be possible to develop violations of Section 186,

Title 29, U, S Code on the part of Schelb, Doria and Hatfield,

or possibly Hoffa, if it can be established that he has shared

in

any payoff made by scheib to a union official
