AIRTEL TO SACS, LA, SL, MP
RR: _ JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA, EARL SCHEIB, etc,
Rew :

an international organizer for the Teamsters Union, Kavner was
reported to be a sick man who wants to leave the Teamsters Union
but Hoffa does not trust Kavmer and will not let him go. Kavner
reportedly is in Mayo Clinic at the present time and the source
feels that Kavner may be “ripe" for intensified inquiry.

According to the informant Earl Scheib has been paying
Doria regularly during the life of a "sweetheart" contract. Scheib
reportedly spends every day at the race track’ and every night
getting drunk at the Del Monico Restaurant, 828 South Robertson
Boulevard; Los Angeles; which Scheib alse owns... Scheib allegedly
loses a lot. of. money gambling and the informant believes that payoffs
to Doria may be covered in this fashion,

The Bureau has .opsned a new case, captioned the same
as this airtel, with Los Angeles as origin and the field should do
likewise, A full and complete investigation concerning all of the
afore-mentioned items should be initiated immediately.

Les Angeles should immediately reinterview the informant
to obtain further specifics concerning. all. of the above-mentioned
matters with particular emphasis-on ascertaining, -if possible,
his sources and:any evidence’ that might xexist which will establish
that these allegations are tru The.additional information the
informant furnishes. concerning this matter shovld be incorporated
into a letterhead memorandum suitable for dissemination to the
Criminal Division, which. should be forwarded to the Bureau by cover
airtel, The identity of the informant. should be concealed therein
and, of course; he should not. be referred to as "Clip." The
additional information given by the informant. also should be utilized
as the basis for further. avenues of investigation in this case
and appropriate leads based thereon should be’ set out and covered
immediately. ‘

As stated above the investigation.in this case should be
complete and thorough io all respects. The field should conduct
all logical investigation te determine the veracity.of this
information. It is pointed out’that through imaginative and probative
investigation it. may be possible. to develop violations of Section 186,
Title 29, U, 5. Code.on the part of Scheib, Doria and Hatfield,
or. possibly Hoffa, if it can be established that. he has shared in
any payoff made by Scheib ‘toza union official,
