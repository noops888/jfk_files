MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Operations Staff

SUBJECT 2. Review of Agency Holdings regarding
Photograph of Unidentified Individual
in Mexico City published by the
Warren Commission

REFERENCE : Letter dated 15 April 1975 by
Mr. David W. Belin, Executive Director
of the Commission on CIA Activities
within the United States, to
Mr. E. Henry “Knoche (copy attached to
accompanying report)

1. This is further to, and in completion of, my
inter:m memorandum of a few weeks ago.

2. The attachment is a detailed review in narrative,
chronological order ~ together with appropriate comment-
ary = of our extensive holdings on thé OSWALD case that
have a bearing on the matter of photographs taken by
Mexico City Station onil, (@ and U5 October 1963 of an
Unidentified Individual. As a consequence of a combina-
tion of analytical error, misjudgement and under the
stress of an urgent desire to contribute to the develop-
ment of the investigation of the assassination, a
cropped version of one of the photographs of the
Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of
evidence in the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an
FBI representative in Dallas. The successive vicissi-
tudes which have now made this event a cause celebre
right down to the present moment are detailed in the
narrative.

3. The attached report is not intended to be an
answer to the Fensterwald/O'Toole article which Mr. Belin
attaches to his memorandum. (I have prepared a paragraph-
by-paregraph refutation and comment on that article,
which I believe is more appropriately handled by a sepa~
rate memorandum to Mr. Belin, and I will prepare this as
a memorandum if that is desired.)

4. The point of the referenced memorandum is that
consideration should be given now to "whether or not the
entixe matter can be fully disclosed at this time.” This All?
submission is designed to make it possible for you,. the * '
IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this i
decision. The narrative-interpretive summary has been H
put together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms,
pseudonyms or other CIA jargon. However. its contents qo
well beyond what has been released to the public thus far |
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must i
be borne in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's |
question. To remove any question in anybody's mind about |
our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up |
by copies of actual documentation from our files. It !
seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or i
his representative review the documentation that backs up |
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into |
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi- |
cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: There
is only one copy of this collection; this is it-]

5. As noted above, one of the photographs taken in
Mexico City on 4 October 1963 was introduced into the
Warren Commission public record. However, it was intro-
duced into that record in two cropped versions. The
Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in
the course of their inquiry at Headquarters and in
Mexico City of the origins of the photograph, the fact
that we had additional photographs of the same individual
taken at different times in Mexico City and on the basis
of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con- i
clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to
OSWALD and the assassination. |

i
i

(
6. In fact, we actually hold twelve different photo-
graphs of the Unidentified Individual. Each of these are*—-
reproduced in the collected documentation backing up the
narrative report (see Items 25 - 27). Chief, LA Division,

had indicated in writing to Chief, CIOPS, that he has no
objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with
these photographs at this time. It should be noted that
Mr. Pensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by
Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the
twelve photographs, other than the one already published
in the Warren Commission report. (It is these two that
he has published in The New York Review of Books article
which Mr. Belin attaches to his memorandum.)

7. %&It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on
whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this
time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must
also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up
the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to
publish the entire run of the photographs for the first
time without taking out the background. Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material
to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself. I
think they should see the entire documentation as it
stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what. could
be discussed and the question of "how?" and “how much?"
could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation is that the more we can say about this
matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding
that there are still sensitivé aspects deriving from the
fact that the operation which produced the photographs
was jointly rin with Mexican liaison and as a consequence
publication at this t: would create additional problems
at that level in Mexico. Also, it should be noted that
the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to
J.C. King on 22 November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup
documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the
decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI
in Dallas laterally from the Field. As far as I know,
there has not been anything published about this aspect
at any time in the past nor have we had any discussions
with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.

SUBBECT : The Photo of an Unidentified Individual in the Warren
Conmission Report: A Factual Chronological Survey

REFERENCE: Memorandum by David W. Belin to Mr. E. Harry Knoche,
15 April 1975 (Attachment A)

1. Reference memorandum suggests it would be appropriate to
“reconsider full disclosure at this time of the circumstances and factual
data relative to the Subject. The purpose of this survey is to permit a

realistic evaluation of the suggestion.

Background —

2. This examination and summary of the record concerns a cropped
photograph considered by the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy (hereinafter cited as the Warren Commission) and
introduced into evidence as Odum Exhibit No. 1.) The photograph
(together with others of the same individual) originated fron a highly

of President Kennedy (hereinafter cited as Hearings), Vol. XX, p. 691.

sensitive intelligence operation being conducted in October 1963 by the
CIA Gad Mexican Security authori ties! against the Soviet and Cuban

Embassies in Hexico City.

' 3, Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop information
on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photograph were
made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the afternoon of
22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,
assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by
an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval
Attache to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing
investigation.- One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was show to
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the
evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM.

4. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of events
at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted in
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped
photo of Jack RUBY the day before he murdered her son. (A further
complication compounding this erroneous conclysion was the fact that
when she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Comission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in
a slightly different manner.)

5. No detail in the Warren Commission report illustrates more

vividly than this one the difficulties that beset simple truth in the

politicized, rigidly deterministic interpretive climate that has been
nurtured by the media over the past decade about the Kennedy Assassina-
tion. The photograph, acknowledged now not to be RUBY, has continued to
preoccupy "specialists" and has became the centerpiece of another
hypothesis. that holds OSWALD to have been “franed” by the use of a
double in his activity in Mexico City.2

Lee Harvey OSWALD - Reporting on Mexico City Stay

6. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his stay in
Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the morning of
2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man
originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is important, therefore, to
an understanding of the acquisition and handling of the photographs by
the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertained and did with
the information it developed about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with

Headquarters action on that information.

7. From all credible evidence known to this time (none, incidentally,
added since the exhaustively unique work of the Warren Commission),
Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and two (2) partial days--
about 116 hours in all--in Mexico City from about 10:00 a.m. 27 September

2 This is the thrust of the article "The CIA and the Man Who Was Not
Oswald" by Bernard Fensterwald and George O'Toole in the New York Review
of Books, a copy of whfth is attached to reference (Attachment A).

1963 to about 8:30 a.m. 2 October 1963. His place of residence was a

small commercial traveler hotel, not frequented by "gringos"--the

~ Hotel Confercio--where he was registered under alias. Exhaustive and

detailed interviews and interrogation by the Mexican authorities and
the’ FBI, after the assassination, established that in the recollection of

all hotel personnel he left early and returned late each day of his stay.

8. Assuming, and allowing for the fact of late arrival and early
departure; that he slept one-third of the time of his stay (38 or 39
hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity to be accounted for.
Overall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods
during 27, 28 September and 1 October. All coverage by CIA during the
entire period was technical. The Station had no live source (living

agent) coverage éither unilateral or from-Mexican VWaison:

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense “under investi-
gation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in the USSR and
return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were known to Mexico Station files
before 10 October 1963, when the bare bones of his biography were
forwarded by Headquarters in response to a Station cabled report of
8 October which had forwarded, on a routine basis, what appeared to be
a contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR. This
was indicated and deduced from technically acquired information on
1 October, which was the first and only occasion in which OSWALD
identified himself (partially) by true name.

SECRET



13-00000

10. At no time during his stay in Mexico City did the CIA acquire
a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage, voice intercept,
as well as photographic, of both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies was
conducted by the Station on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the assassina-
tien, going back to materials from August 1963. It is, therefore, firm
that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his
Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a
cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD
in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters--which did not

have one either--before 22 November 1963.

V1, xbitg Enis intensive review of voice intercept transcripts
by the monitor and other personnel on the basis of the 1 October inter-
cept--which had been reported to Headquarters and disseminated to the
interested members of the intelligence community (as an ex-Marine OSWALD
was a Navy and FBI case under the Delimitations Agreement, and potentially
of interest to the Department of State)--turned up matches based on
content with materials intercepted on 27 and 28 September 1963. These
matches were reported to Headquarters on 23 November 1963. Analysis
based on voice comparison (except for what could be recalled by the
monitor--and this was not an insignificant element because of the
memorably poor Russian spoke by OSWALD) could not be made because the

tapes, in accordance with the normal practice, had been erased and re-used.

SECRET



13-00000

SECRET

12 It must be stressed that the voice intercept and photographic
coverage was not (and normally is not) processed in “real time." The
means of acquisition and the volume of the information precludes anything
but the spot reporting of items judged by the monitor to be of more than
ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in summary logs. Full texts of
selected items require consultation of the tape and either a full tran-
scription or full translation or both. Photo coverage tends to become
available in quantity lots which requires scanning and sélection on a
rapid and accelerated basis in four or five day "peaks." One of the
"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more speedy
review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of
aname. This was precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa-
tions on 1 October with the Soviet Embassy, during which the speaker said
he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to
Headquarters in its first indication on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

13, The Mexico Station did one more thing in its 8 October report
on Lee OSWALD based on its 1 October voice intercepts: it coupled the
data with descriptive information it had acquired from a sensitive
collateral. source--a photograph of a male individual, apparently an
American, who was observed entering the Soviet Embassy on 1 October.

The Station reported this detail on the 8th as a matter of coincident
fact. The Station did not assert or suggest that the data deduced fron
the photo was in fact OSWALD, or indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of His Mexico City Stay

14. One additional element of background must be stipulated now as
the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)
of the photo of the unknown individual placed in the chain of evidence
on 23 November in Dallas by FBI Agent Bardwell ODUM: what was the
totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the after-

noon of the 23rd when all available coverage had been checked?

15. ‘The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably
inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1605 hours Mexico City time.

Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee of the Cuban
Embassy, Consular section, a receptionist, speaks with an unknown
male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia DURAN tells the man that the
American citizen was there, the one who wants a visa for Cuba on
his way to the Soviet Union, and he wants to know with whom he was
talking there because she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet
Embassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa, then
the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him’a visa without further
paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The American, she
Says, wants to know with whom he had talked there because he says
he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

Embassy says to wait a moment. A different Soviet speaks, and

SECRET


13-00000

Silvia DURAN explains the same thing to him. This man says to
leave a name and telephone number and says he will call back.
Silvia DURAN gives the telephone 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate).

She also takes advantage of the conversation and states she has
moved and wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of her change of
address so that she can receive the Soviet: Embassy's Bulletin.

The man says to call KOUKHARENKO to give her new address, then he
asks the name of the Consul or Cultural Attache, Silvia DURAN says
the name is Teresa PROENZA and the telephone number is 14-13-26.

The man says thanks.

b. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1626 hours Mexico City time.

An unidentified male, a Soviet, calls the Cuban Consulate, asks
Silvia DURAN if the American had been there. Silvia DURAN says he
is there now. The Soviet says the Anerican showed papers from the
Consulate in Washington, that he wants to go to the Soviet Union
and be there for-a long time with his wife, who is Russian, but
the answer has not come fron Washington in respect to this problem,
and according to. this procedure it takes four or five months, but
without having permission fron the Soviet Union they should ask, or
better said, they cannot issue a visa there without asking Washing-
ton. However, according to this man, he showed a letter indicating
he was a member of an organization in favor of Cuba and that the

Cubans said that they cannot issue a visa without his having a visa

for the Soviet Union, and now he (the Soviet) does not know what to
do with him (the American), because they have to wait for an answer
from Washington.
Silvia DURAN agrees the same problem exists with the Cubans,
* that the problem with him (the American) is that he does not know
anyone in Cuba and therefore if that is true it will be difficult
for him to get a visa for Cuba, because he was thinking of proces-
sing his visa (for the Soviet Union), because he knew it would
require waiting a long time for his visa to the Soviet Union while
in Cuba, and from there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet said
the thing is that if his wife right now were in Washington she
would receive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet
Union, to return to her country, she is going to receive her visa in
“Washington but having this visa, she could communicate to any place
this permission, for example here or any place she could receive it
(visa or permission), but right now they do not have them.
Silvia DURAN says certainly and they cannot give a letter either
because they do not know if the visa will be approved. The Soviet
says he cannot give a letter or recommendation either because he
does not know him (the American) and asks to be excused for
bothering her. Silvia DURAN says that is all right and many thanks.

cc. 28 September 1963 (Saturday), 1151 hours Mexico City time.

Silvia DURAN calls the USSR Embassy and talks to an unidentified

Soviet. She. says that in the Cuban Embassy there is a North
American who was at the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet says wait a
minute. Silvia DURAN speaks. English with someone--and comments in
' Spanish that they gave APARICIO telephone 14-12-99 and to take the

number down--Silvia DURAN then says the Anerican citizen is going
to talk with you, fi.e., the Soviet. The Anerican first speaks
Russian and the Soviet speaks English. They continue in English.
The American talks broken Russian and says I was in your Embassy and
spoke to your Consul. Just aminute. A Soviet takes the phone and
asks the American in English what does he want? The American says
please speak Russian. The Soviet says what else do you want? The

(- American says I was just now at your Embassy and they took my
address. The Soviet says I know that. The American, in hardly
recognizable Russian, says I did not know it then. I went to the
Cuban Embassy to ask them for my address, because they have it.
The Soviet says why don't you come again and leave your address
with us, it is not far from the Cuban Embassy. The American says
I'11 be there right away.

d. 1 October 1963 (Tuesday), 1031 hours Mexico City time.
An unknown male (American) calls the Soviet Embassy, the Military

Attaché's number, 15-69-87, and says to an unidentified Soviet
respondent: I was at your place last Saturday and talked to your
Consul. They said that they would send a telegram to Washington,

and I wanted to ask you if there is anything new? The Soviet says
I would Tike to, ask you to cal) another phone number? Please write

it down:. 15-60-55, and ask for a consul. Thank you.

@. 1 October 1963 (Tuesday), 1045 hours Mexico City time.

The same person who phoned a day or so ago and spoke in broken
Russian speaks to OBYEDKOV (a Soviet Embassy guard). He says:

This is Lee OSWALD speaking. I was at your place last Saturday and
spoke to a'consul, and they said that they would send a telegram to
Washington,.so I wanted to find out if you have anything new? But
I don't remember the name of that consul. OBYEDKOV says: OSTIKOV.
He is dark (hair or skin ~ 2). OSWALD says yes. My name ts OSWALD.
OBYEDKOV says, just a minute, I'1] find out. They say that they
have not received anything yet. OSWALD says: Have they done
anything? OBYEDKOV says: Yes, they say that a request has been
sent out, but nothing has been received as yet. OSWALD says, and
what . . ,.? OBYEDKOV hangs up.

16. Each of these items, including the texts of the raw intercepts,

were read by, discussed with, and examined by‘Warren Commission staffers
in Headquarters and at the Mexico Station during a stay from 8 - 13 April
1964.3 AIT were made available promptly to the FBI.

17. Summing up, we can state, or by free interpretation reasonably
infer from the intercept evidence, that OSWALD made or could have made
the following contacts with the Cuban and Soviet official establishments

in Mexico City.
’

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday). After arrival and check-in to
his hotel, OSWALD went first to the Cuban Embassy where he talked
with Mrs. Silvia DURAN. The time of his first Cuban Embassy visit
is unknown. The time of his second Cuban Embassy visit was about
3600 hours (i.e., just before closing). Sometime between the two
Cuban Embassy visits, at Mrs. DURAN's indication, he must have
visited the Soviet Embassy. We have no indicatio® ihothe talked
witlr at the Soviet Embassy.

intercepts a - e above, but others for the 27th and one for 3 October
that seemed to have relevance. These have not been included in this
summary because they appear, on review, to be excludable fran the OSWALD
matter on logical or substantive grounds, or both, bearing in mind that
the Soviet Embassy received many calls pertaining to visa matters.

On the 27th at 1037 hours the Soviet Embassy received a call from
an unknown individual speaking Spanish who said he wanted visas to go to
Odessa. He was told the Consul was not in and to call back at 1130.
OSWALD is: known to have arrived at the Flecha Roja bus terminal on bus
#516 at circa 1000 hours on the 27th. It was, therefore, possible for
him to have made this call. But granting this, it is unreasonable to
believe the calls were OSWALD's for the following reasons:

a. The caller wanted visas, and specifically for Odessa.
OSWALD was seeking a visa and never in any context did he specify
the Black Sea port of Odessa as a destination.

12

SECRET


13-00000

ho

SECRET

There was no photographic coverage of OSWALD's entries
into either the Cuban. or Soviet Embassies on the 27th. The lack of
coverage on the Cuban installation is explainable: the camera,
based on the recollection of officers still in service in Head-
quarters, was down on the 27th because of mechanical malfunction,
which was in course of correction. Why OSWALD was missed in his
probable entry to the Soviet installation:on the 27th is not yet
explained; but no technical operation of that kind is infallible.

b. 28 September 1963 (Saturday). [Note: Both the Cuban and

Soviet Embassies were closed to the public on Saturdays. Photo-

graphic coverage was normally suspended Saturdays and Sundays.]

b. The call was directed to the correct Soviet consular
number: 15-60-55. On 1 October, OSWALD first called the wrong
number, 15-69-87 (the MA's number), and had to redirect his call to
the correct number, 15-60-55. It seems unlikely he would have made
what would have been his initial call, on Friday the 27th, to the
correct number, and called the incorrect number on 1 October.

c. There is every reason to believe from the context of the
intercepts, para 15, a-e above, that OSWALD's first destination
after arrival and check-in to his hotel, was a visit to the Cuban
Embassy.

d. The use of the Spanish language would exclude OSWALD unless
he made use of an intermediary, which seems unlikely fron what is
known of his modus operandi.

On 3 October at 1539 hours an individual speaking broken Spanish,

then English, called the Soviet Embassy and asked for a visa. The Soviet
respondent says: (Call on the other phone. The requestor says: I'm

OSWALD, notwithstanding the holiday schedule, went on Saturday
morning to the Soviet Embassy (his second visit) where he spoke to
a Consul. He apparently could not recall his new Texas address.
At circa 1151 hours he went to the Cuban Embassy--his third entry-~
where he had registered it in his visa application the day
previously. He secured the address from Mrs. DURAN and she called
the Soviet Consulate presumably to permit him to give them the
address over the phone. Instead, the Soviet with whom OSWALD spoke
over Mrs. DURAN's telephone invited OSWALD to come back in person,
and he said he would immediately... Presumably, thereupon OSWALD went

please, I'l] have to get a pencil to write the number down. They issue
the visa there? The Soviet: That depends on your conversation. I don't
know about this business. The requestor asks for the number again. The
Soviet gives him the number and tells him to ask for the Consul of the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

The relevance of this intercept to OSWALD is excludable on three
grounds:

a. The use of broken Spanish. OSWALD throughout used broken
Russian or English. He had no competance in Spanish to handle a
conversation of this kind.

b. The substance of the request indicates a visa request in
the first stages of initiation. OSWALD had developed his matter

with the Cubans and the Soviets the previous Saturday to a point
well beyond the stage indicated by the substance of this call.

c. 29 September 1963 (Sunday). No activity registered.
d, 30 September 1963 (Monday). No activity registered.

(It is known that OSWALD reserved space this date on a Mexico City-

Loredo bus, departing 2 October 1963 at 0830 hours.)

e. 1 October 1963 (Tuesday). OSWALD made at least two calls,
at 1031 and 1045 hours, to the Soviet Embassy. He identified himself

twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a guard-~
and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV. There
was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follow-
ing reasoning is correct, that.was as it should be. From the context
an of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to
the Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of
the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were
concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.
Under those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

would have gone to the Soviet Embassy on that date.

5 18. The camera at about mid-day registered the entry into the
Soviet Embassy of a white-shirted individual who, in the opinion of the

c. OSWALD had left Mexico City, based on all the credible
evidence, the early morning of the previous day, 2 October, and
could not have made this local call.

Station, among all the persons photographed that day, appeared to be the
only person--a non-Latin, and possibly an Anerican--who entered the Soviet
installation. On the chance there could be an association between the
identification data derived from the voice intercept and the descriptive
data derived from the photograph, the Station reported the two elements

as separate facts in its cable to Headquarters on 8 October.

19. The Station's action was not unusual and really amounted to an
analytic "quantum leap," justified by the primitive and initiatory status
of the OSWALD identification. Many examples of a similar kind of thing
can be found in the day-to-day record of Station-Headquarters correspon-
dence and reporting.

Headquarters 9 October) the following initial information on OSWALD.4

«who appeared to be an American entering the Soviet
Embassy at 1216 hours, leaving 1222 on 1 October.
Apparent age 35, athletic build, circa 6 feet,
receding hairline, balding top. Wore khakis and
sport shirt.

(3) No local dissemination was being made by the
Station.

21. On 10 October 1963 at 2012Z time the WH Division responsible
for action disseminated this report to the Department of State, the FBI,
and the Navy Department by routine electrical transmission, adding sane

collateral details drawn fron a preliminary file review:

(1) On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive
source in Mexico reported that an Anerican male,
who identified himself as Lee OSWALD, contacted
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring

V7

whether the Embassy had received any news con-
cerning a telegram which had been sent to
Washington. The American was described as
approximately 35 years old, with an athletic
build, about 6 feet tall, with a "receding"

hairline.

(2) It is believed that OSWALD may be identical
*to Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD, born on 18 October 1939
in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine
who defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959
‘and later made arrangements through the United
States Embassy in Moscow to return to the United
States with his Russian-born wife, Marina
Nikolaevna PUSAKOVA [sic] and their child.

(3) The information in paragraph (1) is being
disseminated to your representatives in Mexico City.
Any further information received on this subject

. will be furnished you. This information is being
made available to the Immigration and Naturalization

Service.

22. Although the reaction of the Headquarters desk was “by the
book" and in good time, there were a number of errors in this advisory
to the departments which, on the record, were concerned with the OSWALD

case:

18


13-00000

SECRET

a. OSWALD's middle name was misgiven: "Henry" for Harvey.
The reason for this mistake is simplicity itself. The sheet opening
the file on OSWALD on 9 December 1960 had been erroneously inscribed
"CSWALD, Lee Henry." That sheet--unchanged except for the notation of
the error--is still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

b. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: “PUSAKOVA" for PRUSAKOVA.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters communications throughout the month). More important was:

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with
a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual
observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to
Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,
“appeared to be an Anerican," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

There can be no question that this misreading of the Mexico Station report
was an analyst's error which escaped detection in the coordination before
release: the descriptive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the
mark as to be immediately recognizable as such by the recipients in Head~
quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photos of OSWALD. (In partial
explanation, if not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that moment CIA
had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

23. Confirmation of this judgment is provided by the contents of
the cable composed by the same analyst and sent as of 22092 time (two

hours later) to Mexico Station, referencing its 8 October cable:

defected to USSR in October 1959. OSWALD is
five feet ten inches, one hundred sixty five

pounds, light brown wavy hair, blue eyes.

(2) On 31 October 1959 he attempted to renounce
“his United States citizenship to the United States
Embassy in Moscow, indicating he had applied for
Soviet citizenship. On 13 February the US Embassy
Moscow received an undated letter from OSWALD
postmarked Minsk on 5 February 1961 in which sub-
ject indicated he desired return of his US passport
as he wished to return to USA if "we could come

to some agreement concerning the dropping of any
Jegal proceedings against me." On 8 July on his
own initiative he appeared at the Embassy with

his wife to see about his return to States.
Subject stated that he actually had never applied
for Soviet citizenship and that his application

at that time had been to remain in USSR and for a
temporary extension of his tourist visa pending :
outcome of his request. This application, according

to OSWALD, contained no reference to Soviet

employed since 13 January 1960 in Belorussian
radio and tv factory in Minsk where he worked

as a metal worker in research shop. OSWALD was
married on 30 April 1961 to Marina Nikolaevna

(3) Latest Headquarters information was an FBI
report dated May 1962 saying the FBI had deter-
mined OSWALD. is still a US citizen and both he
and his Soviet wife have exit permits and
Department of State had given approval for their
travel with their infant child to USA.

(4) The Station should pass the information of

above to the Embassy, the FBI, the Navy, and I&NS

(5) Reference and possible identification

advised on any further contacts or positive

24. Headquarters feedback to Mexico City of OSWALD's correct
description should have been sufficient, in view of the incongruities
with the details deduced from the photo of the unidentified male, to
keep these two matters apart as investigative facts. But things did not
work out that way.

25. Mexico Station on 15 October 1963 asked Headquarters to
"please pouch a photo of OSWALD." Headquarters electrically delivered

to the Department of the Navy the following message on 24 October 1963.
“Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD. . .

"It is requested that you forward to this office
as soon as possible two copies of the most recent
photograph you have of subject. We will forward
them to our representative in Mexico, who will

done

26. Within its limitations and capabilities, Mexico Station had

all it could to comply with Headquarters instructions:

a. Headquarters had been alerted, and in turn those agencies
with an investigative or policy interest in OSWALD as an Anerican
in the United States had been alerted, both in Washington’ and in
the field. .

b. Mexico Station had no further contacts by OSWALD to report
because--as it was ultimately ascertained--he had left Mexico City
on 2 October.

c. OSWALD was not an Agency investigative responsibility, in
any case. Even with a photograph, it would have taken very special
efforts, triggered by the other interested U.S. agencies, to have
made a positive identification in view of OSWALD's hotel registra-

tion under alias.

There the matter rested until mid-day 22 November 1963.

The Insertion of the Photo of the Unidentified Individual into the

Chain of Evidence

27. On 22 November 1963 the Mexico Station cabled Headquarters at

22292 time after learning of the arrest of Lee H. OSWALD, age 24,

23

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

possibly in connection with the assassination, and referenced its
earlier messages of 8-9 and 15 October and Headquarters’ reply of

10 October. The Station requested by:

"priority pouch a photo of OSWALD so that Station
can check all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forward-
ing soonest copies of only visitor to Soviet Embassy
on 1 October who could be identical with. OSWALD."

28. “It is clear that Mexico Station had forgotten that according
to its oun communication the unidentified male in the photo was of
“apparent age 35" and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded
' by Headquarters on 10 October precluded the identity with OSWALD of the
person whon they regarded as the “only visitor to the Soviet Embassy on
1 October who could be identical.” :

29. The Station meanwhile had begun an exhaustive and accelerated
review of all its technical and photographic intelligence. A dispatch
was prepared in accordance with the indication given in the cable of
22 November, cited in paragraph. 25 above. The dispatch noted that

"photo coverage of the unidentified individual had turned up on 4 and

15 October at the Soviet and Cuban Embassies, respectively. The text
of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch read: 4

"1. Attached are copies of the only photographs
obtained . . . on 1 October 1963 which appeared

24

SECRET


13-00000

to be an American. This same man visited the Soviet

Embassy on 4 October 1963.

"2. Copies of these photographs were shown to the
U.S. Anbassador on 22 November 1963 and a copy of
each of the two photographs was given to Chief FBI,

Mexico, on that date... .

“P.S, Photographs dated 15 October 1963 were
inserted after typing of dispatch. These were
taken as [the] person entered the Cuban Embassy."

Attached were eight photographs: four (of which two were marked

1 October on reverse) showing the individual in a white shirt, and four
(unmarked on reverse) showing the individual in a black shirt. It
would seem to be logical that the word "sets" was probably anitted from
paragraph two of the dispatch between the words "two" and "photographs."

30. That the Station was working under forced draft is clearly
apparent from the text of the dispatch, which tacked on a material fact
as a postscript. That fact was reported simultaneously by cable to
Headquarters at 0053Z time, 23 November:

“1. Mexico Station has photos same unidentified
American type who is possibly OSWALD entering
Cuban Embassy on 15 October. Searching for

"2. Also attempting establish OSWALD entry and

‘ departure Mexico."

31. Headquarters, at 0136Z time, 23 November 1963, asked Mexico
Station to send a staff member with all photographs to Headquarters on

the next available flight.

32. Concurrently with or before the foregoing cables to Headquarters,
the Chief of Station, Mexico City, had spoken directly by double-talk
telephone with the Western Hemisphere Chief of Division, Mr. J. C. KING,
and secured permission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden-
tified individual to the Legal Attache and to make them known to the

Ambassador.

33. What happened next is best reflected in a personal note by the
Chief of Station to the WH Division Chief, mailed to the latter from
Dallas, together with copies of the photographs, by the Legal Attaches
representative who delivered them to the FBI fn that city.

"22 November 1963
"Dear J.C. [KING]:

"Reference is made to our conversation of 22 November

"Attached are copies of each of the photographs

“At 6 p.m. Mexico time on 22 November, The Anbas-
*sador decided that this was important enough to

Naval Attache is making a special flight from
Mexico City for this purpose. The Legal Attache's
officer who is going to Dallas has promised ta

mail this material to you for me.

“Copies of these photographs are also being sent
by pouch which will leave Mexico City on the
night of 22 November 1963.

“Best wishes.
“Win [SCOTT]"

According to a sidelined comment on this letter, the Legal Attache's
officer was Eldon RUDD.

27

34. The decision to remit the photographs to the FBI in Dallas
had been made by the Ambassador, according to the Chief of Station, who
simultaneously with the FBI agent's departure reported to Headquarters

by cable (0244Z time, 23 November):
'

“FBI agent left here 2000 local time. with two copies
each of six photos of a person suspected to be
OSWALD, on a special flight for Dallas. He is
‘carrying envelope with one copy each photo for
airmail special fron Dallas to J. C. KING at

(. each of the photos showing the same person exiting
the Cuban Embassy forwarded by memorandum leaving
by regular pouch tonight. In view of above does

Hgs still want a staffer with additional photo(s)?"

35. Headquarters responded two hours later, 04222 time,

23 November 1963, cancelling its request:

“1. No need send staffer with photos. We have
asked Navy for photos again, but Mexico can see

OSWALD's picture soonest on the press wire.

"2, Have just re-emphasized to FBI Headquarters

the sensitivity of photos you are sending and also

cceper

relaying names of travelers with similar names.
Note radio says OSWALD lived under alias of
0. H. LEE."

» 36. On the 23rd at 17292 time, Headquarters advised Mexico City:

"The FBI says that the photos of the man
entering the Soviet Embassy which Mexico
Station sent to Dallas were not of Lee OSWALD.
“Presume Mexico Station has double-checked
dates of these photos and is also checking all

pertinent photos for possible shots of OSWALD."

37. And at this point, 2048Z time, 23 November, Mexico Station

finally agreed:

“Saw photos of Lee OSWALD on television night of
22 November and it obvious photos sent to Dallas
were not identical with Lee OSWALD held in Dallas.

Dates are as given on photos.

“Mexico Station is reviewing all available photos

of persons entering Soviet and Cuban Embassies."

38. Two hours later (2254Z time, 23 November 1963) the Station had

reported the results of its effort to review all available coverage:

29

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

“Complete recheck of photos of all visitors to
Cuban Embassy from August through first half of
November against good press photos shows no
evidence of OSWALD visit. Similar blank against
all Soviet Embassy photos fron 1 September.

Note, only visit we know he made to Cuban Embassy
28 September, Saturday, on which Embassy closed
and we had not had coverage... ."

39. With this communication the matter of the "unidentified
individual" reaches the end of Phase I, the key element of which is the
conviction, at first latent, then expressed, that the photographed
individual might be identical with OSWALD. This applies especially to
the Station, though at a certain point even Headquarters moved no
rebuttal despite the hard fact that the description of OSWALD and the
unidentified individual were quite disparate.

40. This review has attempted to deal even-handedly with all items
in the case record that have a bearing on what happened. The operational
zeal, innovativeness, and the high committment of al] involved,
especially in Mexico City, speaks for itself. Equally apparent--
because of the 20/20 advantage of hindsight--is the evidence of
non-performance. It was a critical failure, for example, that no photo
of OSWALD was made avai lable--though it was expressly requested both at
Headquarters and by the field--or that it was not more aggressively

30


13-00000

SECRET

sought by CIA, before 22 November. A photograph of OSWALD would have
obviated--in a way the mere possession of a correct physical description
evidently could not--the whole successive deterioration of what began in
Mexico City as an impressionistic selection of the photograph on

1 dctober 1963 into a cause celebre today.

40. It should be clear from this factual survey that never had
there been a cause celebre with less intrinsic merit. It is equally
clear fron the facts thenselves that there was nothing contrived or
conspired in what happened, unless we have now descended to that point
in human values achieved under STALIN in the USSR and under HITLER in

Germany, where just a plain mistake is per se evidence of conspiracy.

The Genesis and Development of Odum Exhibit No. 1 and
Conmission Exhibit 237

41. Special Agent of the FBI, Bardwell D. ODUM, on 23 November

1963 showed one of the six photos flown up from Mexico City the previous
day to OSWALD's mother, Marguerite OSWALD. ODUM himself had trimmed off
the background by straight cuts. Mrs. OSWALD fiad no recognition of the
image in the photograph. ODUM's own detailed account may be found in

Hearings, op cit, Vol. XX, p. 268.

—

42, The photograph shows the unidentified individual in a black
shirt. It was one of the five photos taken of him in front of the Soviet

31

SECRET


13-00000 |

SECRET

Embassy in Mexico City on 4 October 1963, two days after OSWALD had
left the city.

43. At this point, for the record, the total available photo
covgrage of the unidentified individual numbers twelve (12) photographs:

a. Five (5) taken on 1 October 1963, entering and exiting the
Soviet Embassy. He is garbed in a white shirt and light-colored
(khaki-2) trousers.

b. Five (5) taken on 4 October 1963 in front of the Soviet
Embassy. He is garbed in a dark, open, button-down shirt with a

high-neckline undershirt showing and dark trousers.

c. Two (2) taken on 15 October 1963 in front of the Cuban

Embassy. He is wearing a dark, collarless T-shirt or light sweater.

The negatives of all. of these are extent and are now held in Headquarters
as integral parts of the OSWALD and related file holdings.

44. The result of ODUM's display of the photograph--to repeat, a

+ cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 43b, above--was
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of
her son's killer, Jack RUBY, a day before he perpetuated the deed! Again
the Warren Commission Report (pp. 364-365, 367) exhaustively disposes
of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-
ting fact developed along the way was Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) observation, °

32

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

when she finally admitted before the Commission that the ODUM photograph
was not RUBY, was that the photo had been cropped differently from the
one she had been shown in Dallas. Inspector MALLEY's cropped version of
the ODUM photograph became Commission Exhibit 237 (see Hearings,

Vol. XVI, p. 638).

45. The net effect of the developments in the hearings of the
Commission was to require the admission of the cropped photograph into
evidence in a chain of depositions beginning with ODUM, including the
FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed: the photograph used by
the Commission in Washington), and Richard HELMS, who deposed for. the
originator. These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly.
advised against the publication of the photograph in any form on the
grounds that the Soviets would be immediately alerted to the existence
of a useful and continuing U.S. intelligence operation, and the opera-
tion would go down the drain. There were repeated cables exchanged on
this point between Headquarters and Mexico Station during the summer
of 1964, in particular fran 23 September to 15 October 1964 when the
Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

47. In acceding to the Commission's request for a deposition,
Mr. HELMS, then the Deputy Director for Plans, replied affirmatively to

33

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

Mr. RANKIN by memorandum of 23 June 1964 which included the following

additional observation:

“The Central Intelligence Agency recommends that
' this photograph not be reproduced in the Commis-
sion's report because it would jeopardize a most
confidential and productive operation. In
addition, it could be embarrassing to the indivi-
-dual “involved who as far as the Agency is aware
had no connection with Lee Harvey OSWALD or the
assassination of President KENNEDY."

48. In this instance the needs of the Commission prevailed over
the DCI's statutory obligation to protect sources and methods. The
"Unidentified Individual" remains to this day unidentified and there is
no credible evidence up to this time to rebut the assertion made by
Mr. HELMS ‘in the concluding sentence of his memorandum to Mr. RANKIN on
23 June 1964...And the operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.
Within a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. 1 and
Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet -Embassy began systematic
efforts to survey the surrounding buildings, ostensibly for rental
space, but clearly their inquiries were directed to spotting possible
camera sites. The operation was continued in any case. Within a year
it had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Americans in
contact with the Embassy--a clear sign that this category of visitor
was being warned away bythe Soviets themselves.

Phase III: The “Unidentified Man" Photographs, 1964 - 1975

49. As could be foreseen, there has been persistent pressure by
critics of the Warren Commission Report to exploit Odum Exhibit No. 17
ands Commission Exhibit No. 237 for partisan interpretive purposes. A

considerable correspondence has accumulated since the end of 1964 in

which the Agency has attempted to be responsive to these requests and,

simultaneously, has tried to satisfy what has been its sole interest
from the inception of the matter: to protect the method of acquisition
of the photograph @nd the foreign Waison relationshipl which made the
acquisition possible.

50. Following are highlights from the correspondence during the

current phase.

a. On 16 May 1967, over the signature of the General Counsel
of the Agency, Lawrence R. HOUSTON, CIA voluntarily submitted a
statement about the photograph to Judge BAGERT of the Criminal
District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana.
The response dealt affirmatively with the contents of the subpoena
that had been delivered to the United States Marshall in the District
of Columbia, despite the fact that the subpoena could not be
executed because of the lack of jurisdiction.

Mr. HOUSTON proferred on Agency behalf categoric assur-

ances to the court regarding the inaccuracy of statements and

35

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

inferences made by Mr. GARRISON in New Orleans about the photograph
of the unidentified individual. The following is extracted from

Mr. HOUSTON's memorandum.

. "Because of the publicity which has surrounded the
Orleans Parish Grand Jury proceedings, we have
recently carried out an exhaustive search of the
files of the Central Intelligence Agency for any
‘picture of Lee Harvey OSWALD taken in Mexico. As
a result of this search, I can state categorically
that the files of this Agency do not contain, and
never have contained, any such picture of
Lee Harvey OSWALD taken in Mexico and that we have
no information whatsoever that any such photograph
ever existed. To the best of our knowledge and
information, therefore, there is no such photograph.
Furthermore, the photograph which is printed in the
Warren Commission Report, Exhibit No. 237 in Volume
XVI, never contained more than one figure, and the
figure in the photograph depicts an individual who,
to our knowledge, has not been identified. The
circumstances of the filing of this photograph with
the Warren Commission are set forth in affidavits
on pages 468 and 469 of Volume XI, Hearings Before
the President's Commission on the Assassination of



13-00000

SECRET

President Kennedy. Consequently, we have no record
of any photograph that answers in any way the
description of the one we understand was requested

in the subpoena.

“I hope you will accept this information in this
form in the spirit of cooperation in which it is

proferred."

b. . The Agency has repeatedly serviced requests about the
identify of the unknown individual from Mr. Emory L. BROWN, Jr.,
Route #4, Box 82, Squankum Road, Farmingdale, New Jersey. The last
exchange of correspondence in our record covered the period

4-17 April 1970.

c. Detailed inquiries on the unidentified individual were
received on 1 and 24 November 1971, to which the Agency responded
on 15 November and 14 December, respectively, from

Mr. Paul L. HOCH, 1735 Highland Place #2, Berkeley, California.

d. The most extensive effort to pursue the unidentified
individual was and is being made by Bernard FENSTERWALD, Jr., who
is now Executive Director of a Committee to Investigate Assassina-
tions, 927 55th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., beginning on
22 March 1971, shortly after the Agency declassified Commission
Document No. 674, and extending through 11 October 1972, after the

37

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

FBI's declassification of Commission Document No. 556. On 8 April
1971, Mr. FENSTERWALD was invited to the Agency for a discussion
with the General Counsel, Mr. HOUSTON, of his question about the
photograph of the unknown individual. Two other photographs of.
the unidentified individual, in addition to the photograph
depicted in the two Canmission exhibits, were shown to him at that
time. It is a matter of more than ordinary interest to note that
on this occasion Mr. FENSTERWALD, who was accompanied by his
partner, Mr. William OHLHAUSEN, told Mr. HOUSTON and another
representative of the Agency in attendance that he knew who the
unidentified man was. The following is extracted from Mr. HOUSTON's
Memorandum of Record, 8 April 1971:

"3, Mr, FENSTERWALD came to my office this
morning with his partner, William G. OHLHAUSEN,
looked at the other photographs, and told us he
did know who the man was. He said he is presently
serving a prison term somewhere in the United
States and admitted that he had known OSWALD, but
Mr. FENSTERWALD said there was nothing to indicate
any connection between the man in the photographs
and the assassination of President KENNEDY.

Mr. FENSTERWALD did not give us the man's name at
this time, as he said enough people had suffered

unnecessarily fron allegations that they were

38



13-00000

SECRET

associated with the assassination, but he did
say he.was sure we had a file on the man. He
asked if he could have the photographs, and I
asked how he could use them. He said he did
not know and finally agreed that for the time
being he would not press his request. ...

The whole meeting was extremely friendly and

they thanked us for our response."

The following is extracted from the Memorandum of Record
by the other CIA man present, Mr. Arthur E. DOOLEY.

; "Mr. FENSTERWALD said he knew who the person

, was and had spoken to him; that the man was too
nervous to come forth on his own. FENSTERWALD
would not give the man's name but said he is an
American, serving a prison term in this country

“on a criminal charge, and that he had met OSWALD
in Mexico. I asked whether the prisoner had any
conspiratorial relationship with OSMALD.
FENSTERWALD replied he did not know the answer
as he had not interviewed the man as yet. We
reiterated that we did not know who the man
was, and said that we would like to know his
identity. FENSTERWALD replied that CIA has a

39


13-00000

SECRET

thick file on the unknown man, and that we will

be furnished his name in due course... .

Mr. FENSTERWALD made no reference in his subsequent
+ conversations and correspondence to this allegation about the identity
of the "Unidentified Individual," though the claim, if true, would
be of direct evidential interest and possibly permit us to assert
with finality what we believe has been the fact from the beginning:
the “Unidentified Man” has nothing to do with the OSWALD case at all.
