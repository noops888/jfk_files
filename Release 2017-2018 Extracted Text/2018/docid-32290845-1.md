ReBuairtel 3/22/62.

DL-149-C was recontacted by SA JOSEPH M. MYERS on

3/25/62 and he advised that shortly after WILL WILSON was

elected Attorney General for the State of Texas, informant

"heard" from several sources,

two of whom he named as being

w. M. "BOSTON" SMITH and WILBUR FRANCIS HICKS, aka. Bud Hicks,

Fort

Worth, Texas gamblers and from other sources around

Fort Worth

that WILSON had received money from Las Vegas

gamblers, the names of which were not mentioned prior to

WILSON's allegation.

Informant stated that there was no way

for him to prove this but that the information that he

received was the common talk among the gambling circle in

Fort Worth.

There is no indication in the files of the Dallas

Division that the above information has been received from

other sources and there is no data available which will

confirm or disprove this allegation.

For the information of

the Las Vegas Office, information was developed at Fort Worth

from DL- 149-C who stated that he had heard that WILSON, Attorney

State of Texas, had taken money from Las Vegas,

Nev. gamblers at the time of his election to keep Texas

closed up as far as gambling was concerned, thus forcing the

Texas people to travel by air and other means to Las Vegas

to do their gambling.

With reference to the hoodlum element in Denver,

Colo. purchasing milk companies all over the United States,

DL-149-C stated that he had received this information from

BILL WOODWARD, who resides in the Arlington Heights Section

Denver and asked them if LOICANO was a member of the mafia,

and according to intormant, whoever was at the oner end of

the line "ate WOODWARD out"
