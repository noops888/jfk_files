Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

=.:

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of. Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK.

consisted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobi

Surveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFFA

placed by an employee of the local

telephone company who

adied by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped wa.

intited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

• assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy, (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

gate of the Soviet

the block south. It had a planted view of the

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

ade gesthe Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

Sugreen of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

anawas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips.

LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed

on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station

also conducted a unilateral ma

cept operation,

LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American

foreigners. Their agents were weber telet, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control.

In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence..

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer.

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the LEENvoy listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden nan" was being

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

to accumulate, the inside co (lahoney) becane disgusted and took the film out

for Ramon's brother-in-law to process (probably early 1959). Thus Ramon became

During 1958, Dile Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez Pateos. During this period, the U.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunisn".. One of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former líexi President), acting

for Logez lateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.

The lexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His

son (LIEIVOY-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGAIT also

manipulated control over the principal agent of LIBIGHT mail intercept. The

for the telephone nunbers of the Soviet, Cuban, and

Satellite Erbassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish,

and 1 lugoslav line. The basekouse listening post had

a live

monitor tho made short sumnaries of interesting

conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.t. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9 a 1. Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which had

Russien or another language besides Spanish or English vent out

of

the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations.on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where teet

were translated

Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date afric

goversation because of the volune of

Russian conversations. am

-Members of the Soviet Eubassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Wanell and his wife Barbera

handled all of the processi: g of Soviet transcripts. Hy job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned trat the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Anerican.

However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis.

Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later ve got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

oparetors, cleared the camera each day water there was anita a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograph each

error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious. The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipient (a pulse carera) but it

frequently developed nechanical difficulties. Bob Zabarnardi and Scathar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorna l'ackay screered

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcrists every made in languages other than Spanish or

lish because Win

Scott could read only those two languages ard he

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension of hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping: representatives

for the boat "KALONIA",

and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned out to be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

After

making a call

to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN who said

she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Inmigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

10 ATTER ANALIZING ALL THE TRAFFIC AND READING THE STATEMENT OF

SILVIA DURAN, ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION STILL PUZZLES US-

WHEN LEE

OSWALD WAS IN MEXICO CITY IN LATE SEPTEMBER AND"EARLY OCTOBER TO

15 a

GET A SOVIET VISA AND A CUBANER

NSIT VISA, DID HE WANT TO TRAVEL

TO CUBA RIGHT AWAY, ALONE, OR HAVE HIS WIFE JOIN HIM THERE AND

THEN LEAVE FOR CUBA, OR DID HE PLAN TO RETURN TO THE STATES FIRST

AND THEN LEAVE LATER- ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING

ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

ESCAPE AFTER ASSASSINATING THE PRESIDENT.

20 PLEASE RESTUDY YOUR LIENVOY MATERIAL AND GIVE US YOUR OPINION,

AND ALSO HAVE MEXICANS QUESTION SILVIA DURAN VERY CAREFUL

THIS POINT. ADVISE.

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the

FEr have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Blos countries, there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DCID 4/2,

these porsons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who returned to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of. the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cumming,

13. It is believed that the Soviet oficial with whom

OSWAID dealt in Mesico City was Consular Attache Valeriy

Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV, born in Moscow, 17 March 1933.

A photograph o KOSTIKOV is aitached. In his lettor of

9 November to the Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD

wrote about his "meetings with Comrade KOSTIN (sic) of th

Soviet Union in Mesico City, Mesico, " There is necatficial

usually NGB mes.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's, allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Enbassy on 18 Septerber, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of September. There is a

record showing entry into Mexico on September 26. On about the 15th he

I may even have some later largiation which came ia during the algat -

He was last seen by the landlady

Now we have immigration records showing bim

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that be was not in Mexico

on the l8th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -
