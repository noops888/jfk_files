MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/R&A

SUBJECT: . Trace Results on Persons Connected with
Centro Mondiale Commerciale (World Trade
Center) 7

REFERENCE: Our memorandum of 8 March 1967 on Italian

aspects of the Clay Shaw affair

1, The, 5 March 1967 edition of Il Messaggero contains _
a story linking Clay Shaw, currently under Investigation in
New Orleans for his alleged part in a Kennedy assassination
conspiracy, with Centro Mondiale Commerciale (CMC) in Rome.
The story mentions four other persons as having been in-
volved with CMC: Carlo D'AMELIO, a lawyer and’ former
president of CMC; Ferenc NAGY, former Prime Minister of
Hungary; Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO, president of the Italo-
American Hotel Corporation, who was managing director of
CMC; and George MANDEL, father of Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO
and founder of CMC. A copy of the Il Messaggero story was
forwarded with the reference memorandum.

2, D'AMELIO, Carlo appears to be identical with the
Rome iawyer Carlo D'AMELIO listed on page 464 of the 1956
edition of Panorama Bibliografico degli Italiani D'Oggi.
According tO Panorama, D’AMELIO was boro in May of 1902 in
Naples, ts a Iawyer and publicist, represented the Savoy
(Italian royal family) heirs' claims, and was King Farouk's
lawyer, The Il Messaggero story noted above states that
D'AMELIO was the Tawyer am and administrator of the estates of
Italy's ex-royalty. OIR-605, 15 January 1953, mentions a
fnu D'AMELIO, a lawyer for ex-King Farouk of Egypt. NECA
5013, 28 April 1955, mentions a lawyer, Carlo AMELIO. This
document cannot be located and no further information is
available, It seems likely that all the above are identical
with the Carlo D'AMELIO of CMC.

3. NAGY, Ferenc, the subject of 201-11893, was a cleared
contact of the International Organizations Division. His 201
file contains a number of references to his association with
the World Trade Center. (See attachments.)

that a Heinrich MANDEL-MANTELLO, an Austrian citizen, formerly
an Hungarian citizen, is the adwinistrator of the World Trade
Center, PERMINDEX, Piazza degli Uffici, Viale del Lavoro,

EUR, Rome. He reportedly had contact with Hungarian Minister
Gyula SIMO (201-257724). According to the 5 March 1967 story
in Il Messaggero, Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO's father is George
MANDEL. ESBW-1819, I7 June 1954, states that George MONTELLO
(an alias of George MANDEL) had a son between the ages: of

22 and 26 years old in 1954. -It is possible that this te
Hentich MANDEL-MANTELLO of CuC.

5. MANDEL, George (aka MANTELLO, George /and other
aliases/ 1s the mubject of 201-11728. ‘He is deScribed sa
an unsavory person who has been involved in shady desis

, Since World War II. (See attachments.)

6. No pertinent identifiable information was found op
Nikolaus FISCHER in addition to his being listed in the 1963-
64 Annuario Parlamentare as managing director of CMC.

7. The attached documents are related to an investigation
of PERMINDEX initiated by CIA in 1959. This was the result
of a query from NAGY asking if CIA would be interested in
using PERMINDEX in some capacity. The documents did not
indicate whether or not CIA decided to use PERMINDEX.

a REFERANGES Your Memorandum Request, 10 Movember 1959

1. We wrote to Chief, IG/1 on 25 February last that we had to
date recaived gone information via Aysncy channels but it was not
sufficient to come to any intellicent conclusion with respect to the

‘tas contained in paregraph 5 of the mamorandu in references

2. ¥e, however, were hopeful that more valuable information
could be obtained throurh another source. This has now been received
and while it is not complete it does furnish considerably more infor=
mation than heretofore obtained. The information has been obtained
; fron a recently formed New York Company as U. S. representative of
' the World Trade Center end, more particularly, the firm oncared to
i promte interest snongst U. S. industries and obtain contracts for

space for the opening on 21 May 1960,

1 at .. 3. Attached Exhibit "A" summarises the information received
: and the following comments are offered thoreon:

i a. Capital

It is conceivable that the capital of the Italian
+ comany io not in addition to that of Permindex as previously
“ it has been stated that Permindex was the investing entity in
the World Trade Center.

be Loans

‘This information was soucht et the inception of our
inquiry for it was inconeéivable that the company could have
prepared the buildings for an international exhibit over a
period of 18 sonths with only the subseribad capital as the
eouree of funds. The funds raieed from the tw syndicates mst
have provided tho cost of manarenent and all tho miltifarious
slans in preparation for the establishment of the Permanant
International Exhitition, the main vurpose of the orranisation,

. including the preparation of the various "Palaces" with all tho
utilities required which in varloug vress releases and the Like
bad reached one million dollars. There wuld also be the down
payment on the 18 year lease referred to later.



Ce Operations

\ On the basis of hopes oxpressed in item 2 of Exhibit aA"
there would appear to be a possibility of cross income from rental
epace of $1,625,000 for the initial year, which is epnroximately
50% of the potential. Plus admissions of, say, 1,500,000, against
‘the hope of 2,500,000, which would return $750,000, This would
give @ total ,ross income from those two sources of $2,375,000 for
the first yoar. There .are no figures available of offsetting costs
of the venture, Including the anmal cost of the leased premises.
With respect’ to the cost of finishing the buildings leased and the
installation of electrical, telephonic and other facilities, it ia
not know why tho lessees should be called =pon to meet the costs

tha same would be borne by tha owners, in this case the

normally
 Ytalian Governnent.

d. It 1e believed that a considerable nunber of the
estinated attendance is based on U. S. tourists but we question
the validity of thie theory unless the exhibitors who can take

\ orders are dealing in over-the-counter type of merchandise, which
wuld not seen practical. There are other pointa of interest for

the short tern tourist to Rone.

: @. With rerard to the failure to obtain U. 8. exhibitors
and the restrictions imsosed unon thea and other non-monbers of
the European industry organizations, aa mantioned in Axhibit "An,
1t would seen thet there has been a lack of rosoarch on the part
of manaxenont since one of tha featuras stressed was the selling
that could be done at the site. This is contrary to tho mules
at the Milan Trade Fair which takee place between 1227 April

1960.

‘he At this stage, the venture seens highly speculative from an
Anvestor's point of view, For, if the present exhibitors failed to
renew their contracts for space at the end of the first yoar, the
possibility of obtaining replacements and extonding the space sold
would appear to be rather remote. If the Agreement of Lease signed
by the Corporation, eald-to be for a period of 18 years, should be
breached the ponaltios involved would no doubt be high. Failure to
achieve success by rental of all space to International Exhibitors on
@ broad base would be a serious handicap of such proportions that it
would te calamitous,

5. he preliminary reports from various consulates and
embassies wore virtually uselesa as they consisted principally of
propaganda claina to bolster interest in the grandiose plans of the
principal or ostensible antrenrenaur.

credibility of the report should bo tested by a thorouch cross-

of success are precarious and unless exhiulters are found to occupy

the whole available space in the exhibition buildinzs, and soon, the ,

that contimation will not be possible on a profitable basia (see

There are reportedly 25,000 square meters of space avellable to

provlea of obtaining contracts for the other SOf of the space and to
