MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/R&A

SUBJECT:

Trace Results on Persons Connected with

Centro Mondiale Commerciale (World Trade

Center)

REFERENCE:

Our memorandum of 8 March 1967 on Italian

aspects of the Clay Shaw affair

The, 5 March 1967 edition of Il Messaggero contains

a story linking Clay Shaw, currently under investigation in

New Orleans for his alleged part in a Kennedy assassination

conspiracy, with Centro Mondiale Commerciale (CMC) in Rome.

The story mentions four other persons as having been in-

volved with CMC:

Carlo D'AMELIO, a lawyer and' former

president of CMC; Ferenc NAGY,

former Prime Minister of

Hungary; Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO, president of the Italo

American Hotel Corporation, who was managing director of

CHC; and George MANDEL, father of Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO

founder of CMC.

A copy of the Il Messaggero story was

forwarded with the reference memorandum.

Rome lawyer Carlo

edition of Panorama Bibliografico degli Italiant D'Oggi.

According to

Panorama,

D'AMELIO was born in May of 1902 in

ts a lawyer

and publicist, represented the Savoy

(Italian royal family) heirs' claims, and was King Farouk's

The Il Messaggero story noted above states that

D'AMELIO was the lawyer and administrator of the estates of

ex-royalty. OIR-605, 15 January 1953, mentions a

fnu D'AMELIO, a lawyer for ex-King Farouk of Egypt.

DUds, 28 April 1955, mentions a lawyer, Carlo AMELIO. This

locument cannot be located and no further information is

available.

It seems likely that all the above are identical

with the Carlo D'AMELIO of CMC.

Ferenc, the subject of 201-11893,

contact of the International Organizations

file contains a number of references to his association witl

the World Trade Center. (See attachments.)

reportedly had contact with Hungarian Minister

Gyula SIMO (201-257724).

According to the 5 March 1967 story

in Il Messaggero,

Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO's father is George

MANDEL.

ESBW-1819,

17 June 1954, states that George MONTELLO

(an alias of George MANDEL) had a son between the ages of

22 and 26 years old in 1954.

It is possible that this is

MANDEL, George (aka MANTELLO, George Land other

subject of 201-11728.

He is described as

an unsavory person who has been involved in shady deals

since World War II. (See attachments.)
