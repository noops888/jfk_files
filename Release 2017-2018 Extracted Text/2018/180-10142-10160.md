would have reduced unloading and loading time, as well as

about ten minutes. (Ibid: p. 12) It was not delayed five

hours as reported in Book V. (The Investigation of the

the alleged arrival at 2130 of a private flight with a

the alleged activity involving the private twin-engined

unreported had it occurred. (1977 CIA 1.G. Report,

Presumably, the discrepancies pointed out by the

“Inspector General are meant to explain the fact that
the CIA did not take more aggressive investigative
steps to ascertain whether there might have been some
connection between the delayed flight and the assassina-
tion of John F. Kennedy. In that regard, the 1977 In-
spector General report explains that the Agency had car-
ried the lead as far as it was able by reviewing the

asking (the Mexican surveillance team (LITEMPO)) about

eA the CIA's lack of access to further information about the

to denigrate the value of the information provided on
the unidentified alleged Cubana Airlines and unidenti-
fied passenger do not diminish the apparent negligence
of the agency in seriously pursuing the information as
it was.received. The CIA is not to be faulted for the
strength of its intelligence gathering, but rather

for the judgement which kept that intelligence from the

Warren Commission. (The Warren Commission was mandated
to pass on the strength of exactly that kind of informa-
tion.)

Depsite what is now know about the alleged delay
of the Cubana Airlines flight and the unidentified pas-
senger, the Warren Commission may have wanted to abrigate
suspicions which would remain, and satisfy itself that
these circumstances did not indicate foreign involvement

in the assassination. The CIA contributed to those

suspicions by not airing the matter and explaining the
circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sini-
ster appearing-events.

The Committee has documented instances where the

CIA decided to forego passing information to the Warren



‘acted

Commission out of a desire to not lay bare extremely
sensitive sources and methods of intelligence. The

(cresvox and sirtne)operations fall within that category.
