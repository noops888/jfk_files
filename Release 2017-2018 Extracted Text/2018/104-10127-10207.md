follows: @) Confront Silvia with Nic’ and have Nic inform her of details his statement : ,

character of Silvia ‘there would appear to be good chance of her ‘cracking when confronted °
with details of deal between OSWALD, AZCUE, MERABAL and Silvia and unknown Cuban negro.

If she did break - and we Suggest Mexicans should be asked to go'all out in seeing that
she does ~ we and Mexicans would have needed corroboration of ‘statement of the Nic,

Also suggest Mexi Gov identify and arrest unknown negro, Have Mexicana rearrest Silvia

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police hed interrogated Silvia about money.

who is now hiding in place provided by CAS. We ‘cannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety, Wealth
of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities involv ith OSWALD in Cub Emb :
is striking. 3) At 1215 hrs Mext time 87 Nov.; CAS! officer jag pomised by phone ‘by ° i
ECHEVERRIA that he had rearrested ‘Silvia today because he rasta She was attempting to -
leave Mexi' for Habana. However, Echeverria later told LEGA? mat he had decided to rearrest
Silvia to avoid any ‘possibility she might escapt to Cuba Later be unavailable as a
witness, Since we had received no reply to yesterday's

we have not requested Mexi gov to take g eny action ageinat iivia except to maintain
increased surveillance of her activities. Echeverria Ggtex denied to LEGAT that he hed any

officer was impressed by ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a witness and.

' specific concrete avidence that she was about to le fér Cuba. We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate, It is’ quite pogsible, and even probable, that contra-
dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained: y; desire of GOM to play down importance
of OSWALD visit here, Mexi line still is that OSWALD, Visit related solely to visa question.
Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LEGA' DORTICOS only interested in finding
out whether Mexi authorities tried to pay a stOry<fran Silvia, This is obviously incrorrect
interpretation.’ Neither LOPEZ Meteor nor Ec eve) know of ALVARADO's story. Pls note
thet according Echeverria Silvia is being t © Attorney General's office to which :
Mex press has easy access, Possiblity of/ heas corpus cannot be discounted, 4) We :
have as yet found no trace of the red headed.Gub negro described by ALVARADO, but are :
continuing our search for him. 5) In: lattdion to questions raised in yesterday's telegram
Washington should urgently consider feasib ity of requesting Mexi authorities to arrest
for interrogation: Eusebio AZCUE; Luisa CALDERCN and Alfredo MIRABAL. The two men are
Cuban nationals: and Cuban consular officers, Luisa CALDERON is a dr secretary in Cuban
consulate here,: In this connection article IT of Consular Convention between U, S. and Mexi
exempts from arrest "Consular officers, national of the state by which they are appointed,
and not engaged in any private occupation for gain" except "when charged with the commission
of an act designated by local. legislation as orime other then misdemeanor and subjecting .
the individuel guilty thereof to punishment by imprismmnt." ‘We are checking to see whether
all of these individuals are on current consular list. Even assuming they are, and assuming
also that Cuben-Mexican consular convention is similar to ours, they would all seem to be

ibject to arrest, provided Mexican law definde their a rént conspiracy with OSWALD as 4
Saito and not a m sdemeanor, . They may all quickly be i. urned to Habana: in order to :

eliminate any possibility that Mexi Gov could use them as witnesses, We know that AZCUB PAGE
went to Habana on 19 Noy end we are not now.certain that he or others ar in Mexi at iLOPY

set in seat #14 on the bus and his hotel room was #14 and he arrived in Mexi, by coieidence,

on 14 Aug 62. (That day, while waiting in a park near the bus s tion of the busline Estrellas

for tickets, /: According to Mr, LOZANO, ‘a reservation is recorded by assignine a seat
numberas available and recording opposite the seat number assigned, the name and destination
of the individual requesting the reservations, That reservation is respected under normal
conditions until two hours before departure time; however, in the event all seats are not
filled, it may be held-until:the actual departure of the bus. Prior to the departure of
the bus, a final check is made of passengers in connection with tickets sold for that
particular trip, and at that time the dispatcher communicates by radio to the company
headquarters in Monterrey the number of "paying" passengers on the bus in relation to the
Monterrey or Laredo destinations for which they purchased tickets. / Francisco ALVARADO,
ticket salesman end dispatcher for Transportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of
the handwriting on the 2 Oct 63 manifest on which the name "OSWLD" and destination "Lared"
appear opposite Seat No. 4. ‘He stated that he did not write the "OSWLD" reservation info

and it was his opinion that the reservation had been made and fo recorded by the
baggage handler, Lucio LOPEZ. ALVARADO is quite certein at thé ent time that the
individual designated on the list as "OSWLD" did not purchas “ket and did not travel

on the trip relating to that manifest...‘ No ticket number wast eforded for that person, and
a@ search of the company's records in Monterrey had failed pawkgdate a ticket stub which
was not otherwise Accounted for in connection with that perbigeler trip. /. The notations
by ALVARADO of "9 Laredo, 7 Monterrey" reflected that heghitreported by radio to the
Monterrgy office of the company that the bus had depertaaqetta nine "paying" passengers
for Laredo and seven "paying" passengers destined for,Monterrey. Listed under "Name of
Passengers" were "OSWLD" with no ticket number, indica bing he did not travel; “Angel PEREZ"
with no ticket number or destingtion, which confirm “that he had not purchased a ticket:
and had not boarded the bus; end "Nicolas GONZALEZ%,Segt No. 10, listed as having traveled
on a pass to Torreon. /.../- ALVARADO and Gilberts 0 stated that the notations on
the back of the manifest referred to advances ofefund’ made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the
cash for repairs, parts or other requirements, & Y related that the passenger lists

are not kept as a permanent record, and, when | lanifest was located in the "trash"

at the request of investigators of the Mexi P ential Staff, the Blanks at the tope

of the form had not been filled in as to tipé$d8stination, trip number, bus number, and
date, but they had completed those blanks srvuAheir personal knowledge in order to make
that data clear to the investigators. ' They4{jBo had listed the names of the drivers on the
formax at that time, They affirmed that the handwritten "Transportes Frontera" at the top
of the document had been added by some official of the Mexi Government after the document
was borrowed from them, / Both LOZANO and ALVARADO stated that they had no recollection of

- OSWALD, -etc......they could ‘offer no explanation as:to' how Mexican authorities had arrived

at the conclusion that OSWALD had travelled on the Transportes Frontera bus of 2 Oct 63,

but pointed out thet after the name was located on the msnifest they had not been given 133

this matter, She ‘said since the Emb officers did noti give muc. seredence to anything they said,

some instances corrects that given! in the memo of Dee| 10, Ad ’ Lydia, Horacio, and Ruben
DURAN are all cousins of Elena. Silvia is married to; Horacio;!a weak man, who was converted
