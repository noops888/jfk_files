Interview of subject. (eXN(5)

without prior contact by FO, was approached at his apartment

where he was requested to come to WrO for the purposes of

interview and gaining his assistance.

subject, who was

his pajamas, felt the interview could be done at the

apartment, however since Mrs./DAJANY was in the bedroon,

located just off the living room, subject was advised

that an interview did not appear to be possible under

such circumstances. Subject was reluctant to come to the

office because of numerous things he had to do preparing

for his trip on 8-5-59. He suggested a booth in the

Washington Circle Drug

Store with which he was familiar

and arrangements were made for him to meet Agents there

in ten minutes.

A portion of the interview was conducted

in complete privacy at the drugstore for approximately

thirty-five minutes and at which point it was made

obvious to the subject that he must look at photographs

of

Thereafter,

the interview was condusted

at WrO.

ORDAN

Subject indicated that he would keep iis contact

with interviewing Agents in complete confidence and would

report promptly any further contacts made to him by persons

he believed to be intelligence operators.

DAJANY's accounts

of his contacts ith other than known Israeli Intelligencel

operators were obviously true however his account of

contacts with MOURAD (NEDAN)

and ZUTA were just as false

and fabricated.

Repeated emphasis on the obvious untruths

on his part merely brought more

denials

It appears

subject is a pathological liar.

For the above reasons,

WFO does not recommend

further contact with the subject for the purpose of

developing him as a double agent

or a source of information.

SABBAGH stated he is not acquainted with

OMAR FAROUK DAJANY bat is acquainted with OMAR HASSEN

SIDGI DAJANY, approximately thirty-four years of age,

who is employed by the World Bank, Washington, D. C.

SABBAGH Stated DAJANY Is married to an American girl

named BETTY who is employed by the United States Government

SABBAGH stated that DAJANY is fair

in Washlugton, light brown eyes, brown hair, and 1a

complexioned,

Jordaniàn.

He attended American University In Beirut,

Lebanon, and has a Ph.D from a Washington, D. C. university

in 1957. SABBAGH stated he has been well acquainted with

DAJANY since 1954•

SABBAGH said DAJANY 1s socially charming,

has a ready wit, and fancies himself as a social butterfly.

In 1957, DAJANY's wife asked for a divorce, but this did not

matetialize The two, according to SABBAGH, have been reconciled.

SABBAGH stated that DAJANY would often gloat about

his friendship with the late King ABDULLAH of Jordan and the

present King, HUSSEIN. He said DAJANY had been second in

command at the Jordanian Embassy in Washington, D. C. up to

1953, when he resigned to join the World Bank.

At the time

Of DAJANY's resignation, there was cause for some gossip with

some saying he was discharged but DAJANY deniod this saying

that it was proposed to recall him to Jordan.

SABBAGH said

that DAJANY reported that he refused because he was planning

on furthering his education in Washington and therefore resigned.

SABBAGH said that DAJANY expresses fondness for the United

States because of DAJANY's social acceptability, his American

friends, and comforts of the United States.

SABBAGH said

DAJANY had been critical of policies of the United States

in the Near last, especially in connection with the

Palestine question, but e was no less critical of the Arab

policies at the time of the Palestine issue.

SABBAGH

considered DAJANY the reserve Arab nationalist whose American

training appeared to make him less vitriolic than many of

his nation.

SABBAGH stated that DAJANY has not a few "Jewish"

friends in the United States and is not "anti-Jewish" as such.

DAJANY's father, HASSAN SIDGI DAJANY, was a prominent

Palestinian who was assassinated shortly after the war, accused

of being a British "stooge".

DAJANY, according to SABBAGH,

told him that the American Department of State at the time

suspected him of pro-Soviet leanings and that DAJANY denied

the charge that he had been observed at some date visiting

the Soviet Legation in Beirut. DAJANY is also conscious of

having been seen with his wife attending social functions

at the Soviet Embassy, however, DAJANY claims his name would

still be on the register of the Soviet Embassy from the days

when he was an officer of the Jordanian Embassy.

SABBAGH said

that

although he could not say that DAJANY was actually loyal

to the United States "from a legalistic view point, (indeed his

not being a citizen of the United States saved him from such

expected loyalty) he would say that he would not harm the

United States' interests for the sake of the Soviets.

Insofar

as he is a staunch Arab first, he might harm the United States:

interests in a negative way, that is, by not leaning over

backwards to advance such interests if he thought they conflicted

with the Arab interests."

DAJANY was said to be "well connected" in Washington

and New dork, with one of his friends of long standing, Doctor

RALPH BUNCHE

MOURAD was pursuing a course in economics and was

preparing a thesis in connection with the course and therefore

was consulting DAJANY for assistance.

According to DAJANY,

MOURAD came to Washington from New York about once a month

at which time they would get together for luncheon or a drink

and discuss current topics and the thesis which MOURAD was

preparing.

Oftentimes DAJANY furnished information which

required MOURAD to take notes and DAJANY made notes of what

was being discussed.

DAJANY any money and at no time would he discuss with or

furnish MOURAD any information which could conceivably be

of any intelligence value to the Israelis. DAJANY denied

that he knew MOURAD was associated or employed by the Israeli

Government in the United States and felt confident that

MOURAD was not an intelligence agent. DAJANY could recall

that at least on two occasions he had received a magazine

from MOURAD and on one of these occasions the magazine

contained a manila envelope in which

there was the thesis

on which MOURAD was working.

It is noted that on July 10, 1958, DAJANY had

been observed to enter the Roger Smith Hotel, pick up a

magazine dropped by RAFAEL MEDAN and later, on a streetcar,

take from the magazine a white envelope which he opened

and peered into and later deposited three hundred and fifty

dollars in a bank in Washington. DAJANY vigorously and

categorically denied any such occurrence.

He said that it

may have been one of the times that he received a thesis

which had been enclosed in the magazine but never any money. f

DAJANY recalled that near the end of 1958, he had:

been introduced by MOURAD to an individual he identified as

ZUTA from the photograph.

one dist

This man was met on two occasions

only with the last occasion being several months ago. The

man was introduced by name, however DAJANY did not recall it.

He reported to DAJANY that be was a student at Baltimore,

Maryland and indicated a fair knowledge of the Middle East.

and of Jerusalem.

The man asked about the welfare of certain

families in Jerusalem known to DAJANY.

He appeared to know

the location of the tomb of DAJANY's father and they also

discussed a little Arab girl who had been operated on by a

Doctor DIAMOND in Boston whose

treatment was made possible

by DAJANY's intercession.

DATANY

has not seen MOURAD since the time he

was

introduced to the man known as DAVID ZUTA and DAJANY did

not know whether MOURAD was presently in New York or the

United States.

DAJANY has not been contactedby ZUTA

any fashion since the last time described above. Tells)

In connection with sizeable sums of money received

by DAJANY, as determined by previous investigation, DAJANY

said no such funds were coming into his possession

and

welcomed the examination of his accounts and personal belongings.

After repeated questions concerning financial arrangements between

DAJANY and MEDAN Or ZUTA, DAJANY recalled that he had received

various amounts of money for a period of over three years. He

explained that approximately five years ago while in Europe, he

met a Mr. FALKHIRSCH, whom DAJANY described as a real estate

man from Israel. DAJANY, who, with his family, has considerable

real estate and bank accounts

in Israeli held Jerusalem, was

advised by FALKHIRSCH to make application to the Custodian of

Enemy Property in Israel, in order to draw the proceeds from

rents of the property and part of the savings in banks in

Israel. DAJANY said he waited a while, possibly until about

three years ago, when he made application to the Custodian

(the name of the Custodian and the place to which he directed

the application was unknown to DAJANY He said that about

three years ago money started coming in. First there wa a one

hundred dollar limitation per month that persons outside of

Israel could ruceive.

DAJANY judged there were three hundred

to four hundred Arabs in the United States rechiving

money

from the Custodian of Enemy Property in Israel..

According to DAJANY it is: his understanding that

the money being received from the Custodian of Enemy Property

has ceased or will cease in the near future because of some

fiscal arrangementec Whether it will begin again, Dadany

does not know.

DAJANY was asked if he had in his possession an

accounting of the money received over a given period of

time, however, he said that he had not kept such an account

because the money was sent directly to his family in Beirut,

Lebanon, and they in turn would send part of the money to

which he was entitl d.

He said that many times his

brothers or hisrelatives would make a trip from Jordan to

the United States and would bring to him parcels of goods

and foods and at the same time bring bank drafts or checks

and currency to him from the Custodian of Enemy Property.

DAJANY denied that ZUTA or MOURAD (MEDAN) had ever

handed to him any monies which came from the Custodian and

again denied that he had ever received from New York or from

any other city money as a result of his contacts with any

the Israelis.

In fact, DAJANY said that on at least one

of

occasion MOURAD had borrowed one hundred and fifty dollars

from him as a loan which he later repaid. &

In connection with DAVID ZUTA, 1t

appeared that

ZUTA merely wanted to continue the friendship established

by MOURAD. DAJANY stated that he enjoyed ZUTA because of the

excellent Arabic he spoke but aside from this he did not

feel that ZUTA was overly intelligent.

He said by no means

would he ever suspect that ZUTA was an intelligence operator

and at no time did

he ever discuss with ZUTA anything which

could be termea intelligence

Or

which would be of any value

to the israeli Government.

DAJANY advised that he had no way to contact

either MOURAD (MEDAN) or the person to whom he was introduced

by MOURAD (ZUTA) and that contacts by them with him had been

initiated by these two men.

DAJANY said that his work at the International Bank

did not allow him access to the type of information the

Israeli Government might be desirous of. He worked exclusively

in the Far East such as Burma, Viet Nam, and the Philippines,

and there was nothing in connection with such an assignment

at the International Bank which could be of interest to the

Israeli Government.

He said he was never asked by MOURAD or the person

introduced by MOURAD or by any persons he knew to be Israelis

to furnish them with any information from his work at the

International bank and at no time has he ever recelved any

pay for any discussion he might have had with any Israelis

In concluding the interview, DAJANY stated be

felt fortunate that he was contacted prior to his departure

on "home leave" from the bank for now he could talk to his

mother and brothers in Lebanon and get their permission to

tell the tru. story of his activities, a story which he said

"will make you laugh'.
