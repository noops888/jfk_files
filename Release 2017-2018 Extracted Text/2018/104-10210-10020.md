Soviet Officials’ Ssatesents About NOSENKO

The portrait of NOSENKO which exerges from Soviet
cfficitala' statements abuut him since his defection coin- }
cides warkedly with KUSLNKO's sei:-description, According
to the comments cfé Soviet officials, principally intelli-
gence officers most likely to be speaking authoritatively,
defector NOSENKO was tie son of the deceased Winister, he
served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings
i were overcome througn the patronage of KGS General GRIBANOV,
: and in connection witn uperations against Americans he

occupied positions of progressively greater trust and
responsibility, ultimately becoming deputy Chief of the
Jargest department in tie xey Second (Counterintelligence
Chief Directorate. According to these sources, his defection
wrought severe damage “for years to come” to the KGB
because of his knowledge of KGB operations against American
targets, and his treachery prompted the expulsion and
disgrace of numerous senior KGB personnel, the cecall of
many othere from abroad, the virtual suspension of KGB
operations in the United States, and extraordinary plans to
asSassinate him.

In a second version [more probable since entry to the Moscow

completed the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned ;
to Mosccw afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the 1 fa
Moscow Special Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he ‘

NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory

School (then in Baku).

that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku

Birth to 1945: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on
his early life. However, this portion of his claimed
biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-
abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time cf his
father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the
schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics
(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and
formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of
which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's
claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO

KGB officers who sulmitted a report stating that Si

NOSENKO stated that SHAXHOV had served with the
of Foreign Affairs in the Urn:ted States and that ¢
service he acted as an agent-recruiter for the KGB. S:
was permitted to travel abroad even though suspected c= being
an American agent, because he belonaed to the Ministry of

trips abroad'. "There was no proof, only suspicions, and
furthermore, SHAKHOY was a member of the personal staff of
the head of the Soviet delegation, S.K. Tsarapkin." According
to NOSENKO, SHAKIIOY was not and never had been a KGB officer.

SHAKHOV has served in and visited the United

States since 1942, when he was assigned to the

Soviet Consulate General in New York. He at-

tended the 1945 Conference on International

Organization in San Francisco, and he had at-

tended a number of sessions of the UN General

Assemliy. Most recently SHAKHOV was assigned

to the U.S. in 1963 as a member of the So’

Missicn to the UN. KGB officer RASTVOROY

SLESINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First
Chief Directorate because of his business transactions
with a number cf Soviets who visited his store and in
whom he seemed to show more than casual interest. The
First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that
SLESINGER was trying to become closely acquainted with
some Soviets, to study them, SLESINGER had visited the
Soviet Union several times. Learning SLESINGER planned
another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that “he
might make some contacts or do something interesting”
while visiting the Soviet Union. The KGB wanted to
resolve its suspicions’ that SLESINGER was possibly an
agent or operational contact of the FBI. The KG3 had
a file on SLESINGER, md a senior case officer in the
american Section of the Seventh Department, Yu. M.
DVORKIN, was the responsable case officer. An agent
of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo-
graphic shop 1n Moscow was instructed to become friendly
with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet
Union, and the two men later exchanged correspondence.
SLESINGER went to Odessa to visit relatives, and DYORKI:
directed: the Odessa KGB to "surround" him with agents. «ho.
could watch his behavior. If there had been any indication
of intelligence activities, the KG2 would have attempted.
to recruit SLESINGER, but since no evidence was developed,

NOSENKO's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex
traction, a Russian speaker, and a university professor
in New York City. SHUBIN, who-nad visited the Soviet
Union twice before, visited the Soviet Union in 1953
or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour of
duty in the Seventh Dopartment. At that time, SHUBIN
was the. target of Severith bepartment case officer
A.A. VETLITSKIY, heard later that SHUBIN was
placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance
ebserved SHUBIN as a passenger in a Ministry of Defense
automobile, the GRU was asked about the American, "They
very furtively said that they were interested in him,"
from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

In 1962 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign : i
visitors to the Sovict Union and he noted SHUBIN's name t
and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.
NOSENKO himself telephoned GRU General SOKOLOV's: office
and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according
to another version, S°KOLOV's office was advised by
others). SOXOLOV's office eventually apologized for
having failed carlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's
interest in SHUBIN:

a sensitive source 7

Earlier, cidentified ar
agent apparently identical with SHUBIN
and FBI sources reported SHUBIN's travel
to the USSR in summer 1961 and in
September 1963.

SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport
between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited
tne Soviet Union during that period it was
not as an American tourist under his true
name. Consequently, he could not then have
been the tourist target of the Seventh
Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.
If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring
to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further
contradiction: NOSENKO could not have .
noticed his name while reviewing tourist
lists in the Seventh Department, because
he claims he was in the American Department.

Seventh Department Operations

The notes NOSENKO brought to, CIA in Geneva in 1964
(see p.319) included brief reference to thirteen cther KGB
operations conducted, against what NOSENKO descrited as
tourists during the 1962-1563 period. fer reasons cited
in the description of these operations in Annex B, these
operations are not material to NOSENKO's claim to service
an 1962-1963 as cither Chief of the American-British . os
Commonuealth Section or as Deputy Chief cf the Seventh

with respect to NOSENKO's coun description of Seventh Deparc-

NOSENNO claims, KGB counterirntelligence operations against
tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventn Department
service, NOSENKO's explanaticns for his assignment to

Geneva in 1964 are no more plausible than for his earlier
assignment there in 1962. NOSENKO has asserted that he was
not a lieutenant colonel as the temporesy duty authorization
indicated, but a captain, a rank incongruous with a Deputy
Chief of Department and one from which he presumably would
have been promoted as he assumed the s2nior KGB positions
which ke claimed to have held.
