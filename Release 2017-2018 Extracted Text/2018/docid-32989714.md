. MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any
type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-
ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to
avoid needless repetition of previous instructions.

(B), UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SEC TION -- A reduction in the number of
Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it
necessary that the time of the remainder be utilized most efficiently to
permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies. It is de-
sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by
Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and
will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to
a high-ranking official of another agency, if its sensitivity requires
special hamiling, or if its content requires s planation or eamment.
In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv~
ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda’ to other Govern-
ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not
of the Liaison Section. Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether
such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by
regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred

_to.as form routing slips, contain blo¢ks to be checked which will inform

the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other
agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the
case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-
nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-

“times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether

further’ material may ‘be expected, resulting’in later inquiry from the ad-
dressee. It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

This document ts prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-
nation outside your Committec. Its use is limited to official proceedings by
your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person-
nel without the express approval ‘pf the FBI.

NW 55322

_ °

If a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally
to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-
head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral
dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking
"please handle" or “please pass information to --."

Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four
agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai-
son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re-
quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con-
tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda
discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider-
ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison
representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts
concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.
Matters involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-
ated, wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset. -

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

great many instances be made by telephone and this was considered

in my request for tne retention of tinee Agents to peritoxvi Liaison

These liaison contacts with whom we would be doing
business by phone must be developed and maintained by personal
contact and because of the substantial turnover in agencies,

new contacts must be constantly developed on a personal basis.
These remaining liaison men will also have to act as alternates
for one another during periods of leave or illness and where
emergency situations arise that require handling of an item when
the regular liaison Agent is otherwise engaged. The liaison

pIsCoNEMUANGE oF irarson’ FUNCTIONS |

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I have “carefully looked ifto dis -
continuance of liaison functions and resultant release of Agent Supervisory personnel
for reassignment. I have reviewed the Director's instructions (pertinent memoranda .
attached) and have conferred with various ‘Bureau Officials.

The Director instructed liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President
and National Security Council. Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies
being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison
; with State, Air Force, Army, Navy, Secret Se vice, Internal Revenue and Civil
{ Service. DID feels that some disadvantage or possible criticism could result from
He discontinuance of liaison with these key agencies. : . 4

At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously
we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and
. take such stens as are necessary to solve them. We ean always modify our
om Procedures when it is in the Bureau's interests to do so. Furthermore, there appear
to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be
handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con-
firmation in writing if necessary, Emergency or unusually delicate situations can
_ be handled by direct contact. :

: For above reasons, we should immediaie;##%%scontinue liaison service

with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council,
‘Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular courier service will provide
expedite transmission. An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can
be handled by phone with confirmation by letter, DID can prepare eae in-
structions” and guidelines to implement our new procedures.

: Mr. Sullivan’ also peopueed one of Agents released one Maison be
designated permanent night supervisor on midnight to 8:00 ANS slUEtSRIDI2: which

is presently filled on rotation basis, Sullivan points out additional correspondence
anticipated because of reduction in liaison, making it more difffcult for various units
to spare men for midnight shift on rotation basis. There may be an increase but it
is impossible now, to determine exact extent. DID should defer this request for 90

days to determine extent of increased wor load and submit addition 7jystitication

agencies to maintain effective relations and to resolve and avert incipient problems,
: These matters have been discussed with Mr. Sullivan. While he does not
agree with extent of proposed cutbacks, feeling we should maintain liaison with
certain key agencies as set out in his. previous proposals, he advises DID will
vigorously strive to effectively implement the new procedures,

If these proposals are approved, a total of nine Agent supervisors will be
removed from liaison, thus reducing approved DID Agent complement from 124 to 115,
Nine’ Agents being released from liaison assignment can be assigned as follows: 5 ~

I would appreciate your observations and recom-
mendation on the following suggestion:

For many years, FBIHQ had a Liaison Section
which maintained official liaison with the head-
quarters of other governmental departments and
‘agencies in Washington, D. C. The discontinuance
of that Liaison Section resulted in an attempt by
the Washington Field Office to handle many inquiries
of high-level officials of those departments and
agencies. It should be noted, of course, that this
office of necessity maintains liaison on a relatively
low level with all governmental departments and
agencies to insure the prompt referral of cases and _
to handle matters pertaining to the effective
operation of this office in the District of Columbia.
I feel-that a reinstitution of the Liaison Section
in FBIHQ would place the high level }iaison with
other agencies at the headquarters level where it
‘would obviously be more effective, -

You requested my observations | and recommendations with regard
to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section, '

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time
necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled N
by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various 4
levels at tlie Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies, :
. When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented
a waste of manpower, 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged
in handling domestic liaison with some 81 different agencies, many of which
obviously were of minor importance to our operations. Since that time necessary ©
Viaison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Office as you indicated as,
by supervisors and officials in FBIHQ, Washington Field Office's liaison with d
ie other agencies relates almost entirely to the handii ing of leads and the Bureau's Fu
| routine business with those agencies, |
i] ' [believe we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business :
with the other major Federal agencies if we re-established a Liaison Unit of limited
size to handle only those agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic,
‘I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of the © existing Special Coordination
ae (L. F, Schwartz); :

Memo for Mr. Kinley
Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C, Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State ~ ..

Immigration and Naturalization Service

‘Treasury Department and related agencies with exception of
Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

U, &, Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures
Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

National Secubity Agency cee
Atomic Energy Commission

U. S. Postal Service

Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling
the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle
the greater volume of our business sdating to other agencies, This Unit could be
effectively supervised by its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under
A, J. Decker, Jr, , Chief and G, A. Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities
Intelligence Section. Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kindof _
Supervisinand administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison
matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section, Two other
Supervisors in the Unit (R. A, Bermingham and H, C, Flemister, Jr.) would

:, .continue to handle foreign liaison, to which they are presently assigned, including .
the supervision of Legat operations, A third Agent would need to be added ‘for
_ Supervision of foreign liaison. replace Rachner ,-who is now engaged in these -

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organized

along: the lines indicated above with Unit Chief Schwartz; 5 Agents handling domestic “
~ ¢liaison,.and.three Agents,to handle foreign. liaison, If approved, ‘this would require. |:

the assignment of three additional Agents to this Unit,

This memorandum is in response to_Mr. Gray's
comments concerning your memorandum to Mr. Kinley 6/30/72.
Mr. Gray asked for a review of current and past liaison
procedures,

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives
was not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison
Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility
continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in
the same mahner as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.
This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of
the Bureau's domestic liaison anerations,

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through

the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U. S.

agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those

agencies was accomplished promptly, effectively, economically,

and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems.

By the establishyent of effective liaison contacts, we sought

to recognize and solve minor problems before they became

major problems requiring protracted and/expengdive negotiatyons
. between the Bureau and other agencies. aoe eer -

their operations and established a close perSonal rapport with
high-level officials in those agencies, For example, in matters
of major importance the liaison Agent could make immediate
personal contact with!Cabinet officers, directors of bureaus and
many other officials of the highest level, When our investiga-
tions required interviews of persens of this caliber, the inter=
views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the
interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a
minimum of inconvenience to the official involved, Many of these
high-level contacts were the result of years of development by
the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we were able
to obtain assistance which might otherwise have been difficult
or impossible to obtain, Some examples of this type of support
are the following: :

National Security Agency~One of the Bureau's
Secure telephone systéms was provided and
installed by this Agency at no cost to the
Bureau, a savings of approximately $150, 000,
Through*high-level contacts in this Agency, .
we have also been able to secure the results
of its technical research which might have
been difficult or expensive to obtain through
a other sources,

Post Office-Our close association with the
Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials |
a has resulted in that agency providing support
in some of our most delicate intelligence
operations looking to the identification of
illegal hostile intelligence activities in
this country, -

State Department-In addition to providing
at no cost to the Bureau another secure . :
:, telephone network.and making available to.the: |
Bureau worldwide cable fa cilities of the State
.. Department, our high-level contacts in this.
Department have-on many ‘occasions assisted in,
‘the. speedy resolution ‘of ‘complicated investigative
problems both in the criminal and security fields,

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence
agencies have consistently provided excellent 7
support to the Bureau in both the security and.
eriminal fields. Much of this is due to the
high-level liaison contacts developed over the
years with these agencies. In the Yablonsky
murder case, the military provided, on very
short notice at no cost to the Bureau, an
expert diving team which was able to locate

ene of the weapons involved which was an
essential piece of evidence in this crime.
Likewise, the military has been,able to provide
a wealth of deceptive information to be used

in our double agent operations directed against
Soviet~bloc intelligence agencies.

Immigration and Naturalization Service-
Through high-level contacts with this Service,
we have been able to arrange with a minimum of
compiicated paper work the speedy deportation ;
ef persons entering the United States who are
considered to be threats to the internal security,
such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States
on assassination missions.

In many other instances, through close established
liaison, we were able to avoid the development of situations
in other agencies which could have resulted in operational
problems for the Bureau, Our liaison, for example, with the
President's Commission on the Causes and Prevention of
Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance
_information concerning possible publications or statements
by those commissions which -could have reflected adversely
on the Bureau.

Memorandum E. 8. Miller to Mr, Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit ’

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while
Similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison
Section, are necessarily. less broad and.are directed more
towards facilitating the resolution of problems raised by
other agencies than producing effective action by other
agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit -

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to

two sent
the Special Coordination Unit are handling our domestic

liaison work. One of these is assigned to liaison with

The White House, the Vice President, and the National Security
Council. He is backed up by the other Agent who also attends
meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the
Unit Chief in handling inquiries from other agencies doing
business withthe Bureau.

We have been able in our current system to carry
on an effective liaison operation primarily because of the
quality and number of high-level contacts which had been
developed under the previous. Liaison Section system.
Although effective, this has really been a holding operation
largely dependent upon the existing reservoir of well
developéd contacts, Due to transfers and retirements in
the most important agencies with which we do business, our
established contacts have been deteriorating so that we
are approaching the point of diminishing returns, This

+ situation could be reversed if we had sufficient man power .
to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and
establish new ones, nN

Memorandum E, S. Miller to Mr. Felt
Re: LIAISON SECTION

Costs

. In measuring the cost of a domestic liaison operation,
the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel
involved. Liaison Ageyts are normally selected from among
Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25,583-$33,260); that is, men
who have the ability and experience required to handle a

Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based

on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison
of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and

the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these
figures, it should be recognized that the Section Chief and
Number One Man in the former Liaison Section, and the Unit
Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only
part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised

the coordination of our offices abroad and the investigation

of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in

the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us
abroad, The former Liaison Section also handled other

matters, now absorbed elsewhere, such as emergency planning

and the Bureau's participation in the NATO Special Committee,

such as savings in reduced paper work, savings in man hours
of consultation, savings in the climination of unnecessary
or duplicative investigative effort and, of overriding
importance, the increasing of our operational effectiveness
through the establishment of good will with other agencies.
These savings offset to a considerable degree the increased
salary expenditure.

Conclusion

Although we enjoy a strong operational relationship
with other agencies, including the intelligence agencies,
wherein in many instances we have face-to-face meetings at
the desk level with counterparts in other agencies, we
believe that from the overall standpoint the Bureau can
profit from the assignment of three additional Liaison Agents
to this work. We are not recommending that we enter into
liaison functions as broadly as we were engaged in the past
as we believe such an expenditure would not be justified,
What we are recommending is the assignment of one-half the
personnel which had previously been assigned to direct
liaison functions at less than one-half the previous cost.

ADDENDUM OF W, M. FELT 17-19-72 %

Irecommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the
restricted basis outlined above. The Liaison Section should maintain
smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-
munity and related departments. We would not change in any way very
effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget
Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in
connection with hijackings and security matters, etc. This action would
eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would
set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that
we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard against
it becoming a mail courier operation.

“ a . t i ;

Mr. Gray's approval of the re-establishment of a lfaison section
included an instruction that the section not supervise offices overseas and in
foreign countries. As this work is so basic to the responsibilities of a
liaison section, Iam respectfully presenting several points for Mr. Gray's
consideration in the hope that he will reconsider this prohibition. ae

The supervision of the foreien offices is handled by three men ~
who review the correspondence with our Legats. resolve their numerous
problems, and handle their many contacts wha visit Washington. The latter

also visit other United States agencies while here, requiring coordination which
can best be arranged by a domestic liaison supervisor familiar with the

agency in question. In addition, some of the foreign agencies with which

our Legats are deeply involved maintain representatives in Washington.

These include RCMP, MI-5, MI-6, and the Australian Security Intelligence
Organization. These foreign representatives regularly visit the Bureau

to discuss the various requirements which have been made of them by their
headquarters, The for reign liaison supervisors simply do not have the time

to handle these persons in‘addition to their regular work, and this responsibility , _
which for many years was handled in the front office of the former liaison section,
is now temporarily heing handled in the front office of the section to which the = -
foreign liaison supervisors are attached. The processing of the requests made

by the these men and the discussion of their problems with them is a matter of

basic esate and should Saree! be rasan by whoever will be in change

Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with
those agencies. In similar fashion the British will not furnish derogatory
information directly to the Degartment of Defense in connection with its’
background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled
through FBI. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison

“~- matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same
supervision,

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the
operations of several U. S. agencies and require domestic liaison with those
agencies. Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance
of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is
essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order
to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very
slowly. Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence
Agency(CIA) stations abroad. CIA Headquarters does not permit its overseas
stations to disseminate information to other agencies overseas, including our
Legats, except in unusual circumstances. ‘They frequently, however, suggest
to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items. These
can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison
supervisor. In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with
local representatives of the U. S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat
which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate
military headquarters,

Liaison, or, in éther terms, the establishment of a harmonious
relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.
I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations
closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area. This has proved
to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that
the re-establishment of limited direct liaison in Washington “should be hgidled
. by the same supervision which. has been given to our posts abroad. - The-work-in

Since I think my recommendations to you may possibly be
the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your
order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this
memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion,

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a j
Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section
as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison
Section had operated, according to my understanding. :

Specifically, j recomrended that the reconstituted Section should .
have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and should not
‘Operate out-of ihe Didmestic Inellicanae Division (DID). I suggested that

the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an
appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference meeting.

Supervision of foreign Legats, which supervision had been
included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,
under my proposat, continue to be handled ‘within the DID and thus would

This recommendation was based on the assumption that the
foreign Legats have seen their responsibilities increased-in recent years
to include the collection of political intelligence information for dissemination

Your order reestablishing the Section appears to contemplate
that the new Section will operate out of the DID. If this is your intention,
then there is no’reason why, in my opinion, the Section should not also be
permitted to supervise foreign Legats. The only reason for my recommen-
dation to you that the new Section not supervise foreign Legats was my
parallel recommendation that the new Section be located elsewhere than
the DID.

ous Liaison Section and has an unusually wide personal acquaintance
with both top and working level personnel in other U. S. agencies as
well as having represented the Bureau on several of the U. S. Intelli-
gence Board Committees, Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,
he was given a special citation by the U. S. Air Force in appreciation
for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service,
Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls from
other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his
relationship with other agencies, In addition to a highly successful
and productive career at Headquarters, Schwartz directly supervised
in the New York Office the then highly important investigation of the
New York State Communist Party and its membership prior to his assign-
ment in Washington. \

Liaison Supervisor ~- Robert H.“Haynes, GS-15: Will handle
liaison with the White House, Office of the Vice President, Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, National Security Council, and Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. He handled the Bureau's liaison with
the White House, Office of the Vice President, and the National Secu-
rity Council for a number of years in the old Liaison Section and was
continued in this assignment by the former Director after the Liaison
Section was dissolved. Haynes also has a wide range of contacts in
many other agencies, both military and civilian. He, too, has repre-
sented the Bureau on a number of security~type committees, In addi-

that each of these men should report directly to the Section Chief

N It should be observed that the newly constituted section

will not interfere with the specialized liaison currently maintained
by other divisions and will not attempt to handle liaison across the

In addition to the domestic liaison supervision, discussed
in detail above, the balance of the Section will, as approved by

On 10-11-72 available members of the Personnel Selection
Board met in my office, consisting of myself and Messrs. Walters, Miller,

the pending transfers of SACs Kunkel and McDermott, I did not invite them
‘to attend the meeting; however, in the future I intend to utilize the services
of nearby SACs.

With the exception of Assistant Director Baker, all members
have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of
preference, SA Graham A. Day, ASAC James J. Dunn, and SA Homer A.

seen In line with the ye-establighment of the Liaison

7 Section, as approved by Mr. Gray in my memorandum of 10/19/72,
i -T am recommending that the 10 Supervisors assigned to this Section
I be given the title of Inspector with no change in pay for the

personal cards for official business as needed.

7 The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison
contacts for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis
7 of their background and experience to effectively represent the
Bureau at the highest levels of important foreign and domestic
agencies. All of, these men will be meeting frequently with I Ss,
and foreign officials of the highest rank, which will include
Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and
foreign agencies,
In order to carry out their assignments in the most

effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men
be recognized as much as possible by the officials they are con-
tacting as key representatives of the FBI. This procedure has been
followed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives
handling our lifison with Congress ahd the American Bar Association,
both of whom carry the title of Inspector. This has been found
to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling
their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be
equally helpful to the men of our new Liaison Section who have been
Selected to handle our domestic and foreign liaison assignments.

Memorandum E.S. Miller to W. M. Felt ‘ :
Re: Liaison Section 4

ADDENDUM ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION’ ww 11/24/72

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with
title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to
Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or
seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau
representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties
requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the
Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.
Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as
much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to qualify them
for the temporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment
and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties  ~
authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

“ ADDENDUM W.M.FELT 3°. “11-27-72:.
I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic .

Intelligence and Administratiye Divisions as to the conferring of the title

. Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section,
However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served
in the long run by taking favorable action. I am convinced that to accede
to this request would result in.similar requests from other divisions, many
of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.
In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance
of the Inspector's title in the Bureau.

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from
such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him, Such action would
be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference
Act which specifically states 30 dayd advance written notice must be furnished
to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank. If we were to
advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only
for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the
law in giving the employee 30 days’ advance written notice. Therefore, in
considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not not given to the
recommendation,

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in
your memoranda, namely that our roreign iiaisonu offices, With the exception
of Mexico City, are not operational and that we cannot develop "hard, high
quality, positive intelligence by sending men to these countries only in a
liaison capacity." We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign
offices on an operational basis. The law specifically limits foreign intelli
gence operations to coverage by the CIA, and, therefore, we have known
all along that our offices in foreign countries could not be in an operational

status.

I cannot agree that establishing liaison offices in foreign coun-
tries without being operational prevents us from developing hard, high qualitr
and positive intelligence. Certainly in all memoranda prior to your memo-
randum of June 7, 1971, you did not indicate any such reservation and, in
fact, you specifically initialled the memorandum of Mr. Brennan addressed

to you under data of eptember 2%, 1970, upos which I predicated my letter
to tha President of ceptamber 21, 1970. At that time believed that by
reason of your approval of the various memornnda dealing with the foreign
Hatson operations, you were in accord with the proeedures which the Bureau
had followed aad, in fact, approved the establishment of additional iaison
offices which } listed in my letter to the Frealdent of Semtember 21, 1979,

chenaeaa 21, 1970,

¥ want to alse point ont that at no time, either in September er
raore recentiy, did | evar surgest to the President the idea that we should
expand our foreiga Haison eperations. it pas the President's idea expressed
to toe ia Ceplember, 1970, toatl such expansion ahould take place, aud, as
& result thereo!, 1 submitted soy leiter to him of Lentember 31, 1970, The
President 1 know in my presence directed My, Haldeman to present my
letter to the President to the Secretary of btate for prompt and iramediate

that by. Hissinger inquired of me as to what had happened to the exparsion
of our foreign liaison which the Fresident bad anproved being expanded in--
feptermber, 1970. Viben i told br. Kissinger the? this matter bad been
delayed in the State Denartment and that 1] had been awaiting word for approval
of tha same by the Searetary of tale, Gr, Kiewinger stated ho would personally
take this matter up with the President and that 1 would raceive in a few days
ths State Departuent's approval of the expansion of our foreign idison, :
tteveral days later in Desembar, 1978, I received a telephone call irom |
’ Secretary of itate Nogers atattag that the Presicent bed spolsen to hima about
the expansion of our foyeign Kialson operations and that he was in full accord
“with the same with the exception of the opening of an office at Helsinks 1a

of tho Russian Government and the United ttates Government concerning

Dear Mr, Irwin:
Ambassador Wymberley Coerr and Mr. R. Glynn Mays

‘of your Department have asked for additional details with

reference to my letter of September 20, 1971, to Secretary
Rogers. Specific questions were raised concerning the
location of the proposed new posts and concerning our
method of operation when they are established.

In general, our need for additional liaison
abroad stems from the constantly increasing travel abroad
of United States citizens under investigation in this
country, for exampie, just five vears agu ia z ai OSS,

a total of 653 persons wanted in the United States were

ocated through requests initiated by our Legal Attaches.

n fiscal 1971, 2369 such persons were located. In fiscal
3966, slightly more than $500,000 in property stolen in the
nited States was located abroad; while in fiscal 1971, |.
yearly $1,500,000 of such property was so located, In
espouse to earlier programs aimed at reducing United States
lersonnel abroad, I closed our posts at lianila, Rio de Janeiro

“ @nd Santo Domingo and endeavored to cover those areas by

road trip from other posts, This has resulted in inevitable

~delays and in materially increased travel costs, Asa

result, when the President asked that I increase our liaison
activities abroad, I suggested the _Feopening of these three
posts, .

Our method of operation at each post will continue,
‘as in the past, to include the developnent and maintenance:

here woulda be responsible for liaison in
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, all currently
being covered by road trip from Hong Kong, and
would initiate coverage in Indonesia.

at long distance. The continued United States
military presence in the Philippines, coupled

..-, ‘with the large number of Philippine nationals
7 who have becone involved in difficulties in
the United States and then returned to their
home, has resulted in the continuation of a
relatively large work load in this area.

NEW DELHI, INDIA This is an area in which ak:
We have not previously had regular coverage, - :
and it has been necessary on a number of
aeeasinna to despatch representatives from .

Rome or Hong Kong to handle problems arising
there. It is planned that our representative

in New Delhi will cover not only india but also
East and West Pakistan and Nepal. It is possible

(ieee oe that additional territory may be assigned to

. this office in the future. It is noted that |
there are nine graduates of the FBI National
Acadeny located in this area. 7

RIO DE JANEIRO, BRA This office, which was

in operation trom to 1967, was consolidated

with our post in Buenos Aires, Argentina, ag an

- economy measure. During the more than four years
that it has been closed, it has become increasingly
apparent that the loss in prompt and effective
coverage is greater than the small saving justifies.
A number of individuals of interest to the FBI
have either moved or traveled to Brazil, and it

*on 11/2/71 we called Mr. R. Glynn Mays, who is ° |
assigned by the Department of State to the National Security
Council Under Secretaries Committee, and inquired concerning
when we could expect a response to our letters of'9/20/71
and 10/14/71 regarding the opening of six additional foreign ..
liaison posts. on

“Mays stated that Bureau letter 9/20/71 had peen *

referred to the National Security Council Under Secretaries .
Committee as that group is responsible for the establishment
and alteration of overseas personnel ceilings. Inasmuch as
each U. S. Ambassador is a personal representative of the
President and is not subservient to the Department of State,
inquiries were sent to the six affected Ambassadors regarding
their concurrence in our proposal. Each of the Ambassadors

| resnonded by raising various questions concerning such 7
matters as what information might be given to the host
government, FBI methods of operation overseas, and reasons

as to why their particular post had been chosen. These ~

_ inquiries resulted in the visit of Ambassador Wymberley Coerr,
Deputy Director of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;
and Mr. Mays to the Bureau on 10/12/71 as reported in my. -
memorandum of that date. As a result of that memorandum, ~

‘a detailed letter dated 10/14/71 was forwarded to Under
Secretary of State John N. Irwin II furnishing specifics:
concerning our overseas operations and our reasons for |
selection of the posts involved.

. Mays stated that upon receipt of the second letter,~
individual responses were prepared and forwarded to each ‘of 7
the six Ambassadors who had raised questions. Replies‘are
still pending, and Mays said he knew no way of hurrying the
Ambassadors short of telephoning them, It was pointed out

Honorable John N. Irwin, II, Under Seeretary of State, called.
He said he was calling about the positions abroad (Legal Attaches) that I
talked to the President about and the President authorized tc be done, and
Mr. Irwin said they, of course, want to work out how to do this. Mr. Irwin
continued that after getting my letter in October they sent it to the embassies
to get some comments back and they wanted to talk about these and how was
the best way partly because of the situation overseas and a good part because
of the recent Presidential order in connection with the new economic policy
of reducing 5% overseas and this raises, from an internal point of view,
problems as to how they take this and where and the amount of support
they have to give overseas to the variety of agencies they support over and
beyond themselves. Mr. Irwin said it would be helpful if they could taik about
these with me or whomever I might designate. Mr. Irwin continued that he
thought they had talked once and then the FBI officer said he would like to
have it in writing rather than further discussion.

Mr. Irwin said he talked to Secretary of State William P. Rogers
and Mr. Rogers thought it would be helpful if they could, rather than going
back and forth in writing, try and work it out because they Imow this is what
the President requested be done. I commented that the President is anxious.
Mr, Irwin said they do want to try to fit it in with the miscellaneous politi-
cal and administrative problems that exist rather than to just move without
the opportunity for further discussion.

I told Mr. Irwin I thought Mr. Miller, Assistant Director in charge
of the Domestic Intelligence Division and under whom the Legal Attaches oper-
ate, would be the one to talk to and if he, Mr. Irwin, would tell me what time
was convenient for him, I could check with Mr. Miller. Mr. Irwin asked if they
should call Mr. Miller direct .and I told him I would call Mr, Miller and tell
him that kr. Irwin would be in touch with him. Mr. Irwin thanked me.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF/ FOREIGN/LTAT SON

As instructed, I met’ on 11/24/71 with’ state Under ~
Secretary John N. Irwin II; Deputy Under Secretary William
B. Macomber, Jr.; his Executive Assistant, Samuel R. Gammon;
Wymberley Coerr, Deputy Director, Bureau of Intelligence and
Research; and R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems
Staff. I was accompanied by SA Graham A. Day of this Division.
Mr. Irwin, who was unable to stay for the entire meeting,
stated he was most appreciative of the Director's rapid and
cooperative response to his request for further discussion.

He pointed out that he has a tremendous respect for the Director
and for the organization which he has built and has instructed
his personnel at State to do everything in their power to
fulfill the FBI request. He notcd that the request did, however,
represent a substantial problem for State and that he had

asked for discussion because of the difficulties which State

had encountered. :

ce

State is fully aware of President Nixon's instruction
that FBI liaison activities be expanded. The President has
also, however, instructed that the official profile of the
United States be lowered abroad and that a five percent
across-the-board reduction in United States overseas personnel
be made. Coming as it does on the heels of President Johnson's
. fifteen percent reduction and President Nixon's earlier ten
percent reduction, this has created serious staffing problems
‘4s - dn each U. S. Embassy, As the Ambassador's concurrence is
* necessary before any new personnel can be sent abroad, each

of those potentially affected by our expansion was consulted
by State and each one raised serious objections, Some, as
will be indicated below, questioned the necessity for an Agent
to be stationed in their countries and several, pointing to
the current expansion of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous
Drugs, which is also being strongiy resisted, asked why one.
Justice representative could not represent both agencies.

As a result, both Mr. Irwin and Mr. Macomber asked that we
take a hard look at our proposals to see if some adjustments
could be made which would result in a smalder overall increase
in our overseas-personnel+— i .

Memorandum E. 8S. Miller to Mr. Rosen
Re: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

I pointed out that there would be no possibility
of our "doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining
that our functions and methods of operation are totally
different and would actually be incompatible in some areas.
I noted that our modest request had actually been scaled ~*~
down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited
each office to a single Agent with only one Clerk-Stenographer.
I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which
.had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin
a and stated that we would not have made the request if we
‘.shad not felt it fully justified and responsive to the
~ President's instruction. I said that we would, however,
caréfully consider each part of the request once more’ to
1 see if there was any way in which the total number of personnel
involved might be reduced. It was agreed that following this -
review, we would meét again for further discussion during
the week of Novembér 29, 1971. Comments and recommendations
concerning the specific areas follow:

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Agency for International Development Mission
ana here has: been withdrawn in the face of local criticism of
i U. S, efforts to influence the Brazilian Police, We have
| bden covering this enormous country from our office in

_ Argentina on a 2,500 mile round trip basis. No criticism

i has been made of our liaison contacts with the Brazilian
Police or other agencies, and we feel we should insist on
reopening our office here. Ry reducing our staff in :
s Buenos Aires by one Agent and one_cle nich we we intended
»| | to-do anyway); Pédpening thi a
. ' increase in personnel.

i “Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia : 7 — 4

There is an abnormally large percentage of Central
Intelligence Agency personnel here on both an overt and covert
basis, and the addition of another investigative agency is
- feared by the Ambassador as objectionable to the Malaysian t
Government which is endeavoring to maintain a neutral position.
State asks that we let them explore the possibility of opening
in Singapore instead of Kuala Lumpur.. Singapore is extremely _ ...

~‘elose and is ‘actually a better location from the ‘standpoint
of travelers both east and west as Singapore is a normal
international aviation stop. We believe Singapore would be
good a location as Kuala’ Lumpur and recommend’ that

further delay.

The Ambassador here was most specific in pointing

It was pointed out that, whereas we had planned
to cover East and West Pakistan from this point, the current
hostilities would make this unfeasible. India itself, however,
is a huge country with an enormous population and is of great
potential political significance. For the present, we could

resumption of better relations between India and Pakistan

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Rosen
Re: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

We_ believe we could forgo opening an office here
at this time as, ‘of the various offices considered, this
/WOULG probably be the least productive of political intelli-
gence since it has a stable government and enjoys friendly
relations with the U. S. From a cost standpoint, this would
probably be the most expensive post to open merely because
of the great distance and high transportation costs.

ACTION:

It is recommended that we inform State we have
jvery carefully reconsidered our request and, in an effort
to be fully cooperative, we have altered our request with
line result that only six additional positions*abroad will be

Wee SG Lather thau the twelve originuily requested. We wiil

ask to open at Rio de Janeiro, Manila, New Delhi and Singapore,

making other arrangements for the coverage we had requested
from Santo Domingo and Canberra. We will press for an
early meeting for the consideration of this proposal and
ask that we be permitted to proceed at the earliest possible
moment as there has already been so much delay.

:

“EXPANSION OF

As indicated in memorandum 11/29/71, we had an +

appointment to discuss our expansion further with Deputy
Under Secretary of State Macomber at 3:30 p.m., 11/30/71.
At noon on 11/30/71, Mr. Macomber's office advised that he
had been unexpectedly summoned by the Secretary of State
to a meeting which would occupy the balance of the afternoon,
and we were asked to postpone our discussion until 12/2/71..
I stated that I was quite anxious to resolve this matter
without further delay and asked to meet with other State . A
representatives to discuss our proposal as originally planned.

a Accordingly, we met with Ambassador Wymberley Coerr, Deputy
Director,of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;
Samuel R. Gammon, Executive Assistant to Mr. Macomber; and
R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems Staff. I was
accompanied by SA Graham Day of this Division.

i reduce our initial request, I said that we would agree to
{ Singapore in place of Kuala Lumpur as suggested by State,
and we would cancel our request to open offices in Canberra
and Santo Domingo. I pointed out that we would staff our
office in Rio de Janeiro by reducing our present staff in
, . Buenos Aires and that we were therefore requesting, in effect,

In addition, Mr. Mays said that the Ambassador in New Delhi

India to justify stationing a man there. Mays asked for ~-
figures which State could use to support our request.

: I stated that we were faced with a situation in
which the President had, on September 20, 1971, asked the

* Director to expand his liaison operations abroad and that
here we were more than two months later without having taken
a single action in direct response to the President's instruction.
I pointed out that it seemed to me that the President's instruction
should take precedence over any Ambassadorial question and
that I saw no point in becoming involved in quibbling with
individual Ambassadors in efforts to justify doing what the
President had asked. Ambassador Coerr said that he understood
our position perfectly and State would proceed to correspond
with the Ambassadors further. He did ask that we present
the snecial nrohlem of Manila for determination by the Director.

aaa

With respect to Manila, we have a fair ‘volume of q

we do not feel it would be feasible to cover Manila from
Australia because of the distance involved, and we want to
leave our office in Hong Kong free to concentrate on the
greatly enlarged Chinese problem. We feel, therefore, that
despite the Ambassador's objection, we should insist upon
reopening our office in Manila.

War was declared on India by Pakistan the same ‘day
inh that clearance was received from State for our office there.
‘We have been watching the situation closely and it has :

jDear Mr. Hoover:

Mr. Papich has orally informed me that you wish to have the
identity of the FBI agent who was the source of certain information
communicated to an employee of this, Agency,

This information regarding the disappearance Of oOné Thomas_Riha was. °°

in turn passed to Dr. Joseph Smiley, then President6r Colorado

University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a university in El

Paso, Texas, and to the District Attorney of Denver, Mr. James

McKevitt, In view of your personal interest in this matter, I instructed!
to report to me/in person,

2 Ihave reviewed this complicated case in detail withL_ id
cree and have requested him to reveal the identity of his source, As a point
4 . of honor and personal integrity, Co was adamant that he :
a .could not disclose the identity of his source, Under further pressure
* from me, - maintained his position, stating that in de-
fense of it he was prepared to submit his resignation immediately,

. CO explained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases
had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational
in nature. He stressed that there was embarrassing public speculation
as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha's
disappearance, : ae

The purpose of [eee eee conference with the District

Attorney of Denver was to solicit his good offices to remove pres-
sures and the possible serving of a subpoena on Dr. Joseph Smiley.
He also sought to orient the District Attorney properly so that he
would not continue to have an erroneous impression of the roles of
the CIA and the FBI, thereby éliminating further adverse publicity.

| ESEETESSsSETEsanSTEETaEEl affirms that before going to District Attorney

McKevitt he called upon the FBI Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Scott
Werner, and sought to coordinate with him our respective interests.
He also solicited Mr. Werner to accompany him'to the District
Attorney. : :

protacdes j exchange during which he remarked that our representative in
DA Qi Boulder was 'lying'' and then proceeded to challenge the veracity of
Subsequently, Joongezred with

the District Attorney alone. He was successful in persuading the

District Attorney to make a favorable public statement which had

the effect of putting this issue regarding Dr, Smiley and other rumors

to rest as far as the public was concerned.

Ihave carefully reviewed the statements er) |

I feel that poor judgment was employed in passing the information in
question to Dr. Smiley and later 'to the District Attorney, This should
only have been done with specific FBI approval. I wish to assure you
that I do not condone violations of the third agency rule, and 1am
taking steps to impress once again this elementary fact upon all Agency
officials,

While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review
of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha's
disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum
case. Briefly, since 1958 we have communicated to your Bureau
significant information which relates to Riha's involvement with
Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron
Curtain, Iattach for your information and convenience copies of
pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case,

Ihope sincerely that this recent incident will not impair our
mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors
possibly having a significant bearing on U.S, intelligence and internal
security interests, I shall pursue this matter through our respective
liaison offices.

; In closing, Mr, Hoover, I wish to state that this Agency can n only,
fully, perform its duties in the furtherance of the national security when
7 it has the closest coordination and teamwork with the Federal Bureau “Of,
/ 4 Investigation. Furthermore, it is necessary that we continue to con-
j duct our business in an atmosphere of mutual respect. I trust that we
/ can coordinate closely any future developments or actions in these cases,
{ in order to prevent the airing in public of conflicts or differences between
H the two agencies. I feel strongly that there are representatives of the
3 news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national
| scale. Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in
{

SUBJECT : RIHA, Thomas yo, a

1. The following report concerning an attempt by a
member of Czech Intelligence to effect the repatriation of
Subject, a naturalized American East-West Exchange student,
to his country of origin was recently submitted by a Source
of this office.

2. Source first became acquainted with Subject during:
the past year at The Russian Research Center, Harvard University.
On 10 September 1958 he ran into Subject by chance at the SAS

office in Vienna as the two b ght ta Conenhagen
via Duesseldorf. During the t ip Subject closed the
following to source which has been supplemented from :

information from our files.

3. RIHA, who was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia
17 April 1929, is one of the twenty American students
selected for the East-West Exchange Program and will be
', Studying in the USSR for the 1958-59 academic year. Files
in this Agency indicate that RIHA arrived in the U. eer on
‘15 July 1947 and became a citizen in 1952.

4. Our source informed ES shat RUC HAE HORSES “Pragué,

5. RIHA told our source that when he arrived in Prague
he was put into a Government hotel for'three days before he
was allowed to stay with his relatives and friends. During
this time, and perhaps later, RIIiA was accompanied through
the city by a guide whom he described as a "Government e
Official" name unknown, who attempted to effect Subject's
~~ repatriation to Czechoslovakia. RIHA told our source that
this man has set up an appointment (date and address unknown)
to meet him in Moscow to talk further.

6. Subject told our source that this "Government
,Official" did not mention Czech Intelligence or Security
|Forces as such and that he (RIHA) is not too worried
;concerning this contact. RIHA apparently feels that it
‘is the price he must pay in order to study in the Soviet
‘Union and once he gets deeply into his studies in Moscow
“scan he feels that he can plead that he is too busy with his

academic work to have contact with any officials. Our

source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence
with the Czech official. We have no description or name for
the Czech official.

7. It is requested that no further dissemination be
made of this information without prior clearance from this
office, and that our source be fully protected in the event
that contact is made with RIHA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director
Federal bureau of Investigation

SUBJECT : . RIHA,. Thomas <0 4

°

1. Reference is’made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of

27 October 1958 concerning an attempt by a member of Czech
Intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the
latter was in Prague in June of 1958 visiting relatives

en route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as an East-West
Exchange Student. The following report describes further
action taken by the KGB in Moscow to cultivate Subject, and
was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source.

2. Sometime in December 1958, Subj ct again | met the
Czech CfLicial who had tricd to have Subject Topatriate to
the CSR in Prague last summer. According to our source, it
was apparently an accidental meeting at a Moscow railroad
station as the Czech was returning to Prague. The Czech was
delighted to see Subject, and introduced him to a Soviet
official. This Soviet identified himself only by a first
name and a telephone number, both unknown to our source.

The Soviet described his work as being in the American
‘Section of the MVD.

3. This Soviet Official has been cultivating Subject

(trying to see him as often as possible, sometimes twice a
.Wweek) since their introduction in December, by offering such
blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine
into- forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter-
tainment, access to material from previously inaccessible
archives, the use of private country villas and all the
"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want.
Subject has further ‘been promised the opportunity of returning
to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future
date. He would have to pay only his way over there; his
expenses and return trip to the US would be paid by the
Soviets.

4. Subject has taken advantage of this offer to take
' several trips for sightseeing into forbidden areas around
Moscow in a private car with the Soviet Official, and has
also taken up a few offers for entertainment. Subject visited
one of these villas, but refused the girls on the ground that
he wants a woman to like him for himself, and not because she
has been told to do so. The Soviet answered that "some of
them will really learn to like you for yourself,.as well as
work for us," but Subject still declined to get involved.
However, Subject has recently been taken up by a Soviet girl
who had previously tried to seduce another American student
and subsequently blurted out that she was put onto the latter
American by the MVD, which she has also told Subject. Subject
is reported to be responding warmly to her approaches although
he has flatly told her he doesn't trust her nor any Russian
completely. He claims he enjoys her company but will not
have a serious affair with her, and suspects she may be tied
up with the other women offered him by the Soviet Official.

5. In his relatiousiip with the Soviet Official, Subject
is reportedly aware that he is playing a risky game, and is
only utilizing the situation for the comfort and convenience
it brings him. He has told the Soviet frankly that he cannot
be wom over ideologically. Subject says he feels that the
Soviets' interest in him is to cultivate him as a scholar of
possible future importance to insure that he will always be
“sympathetic to the Soviet Union. Subject has reportedly told
several other American students of his relationship with the
Soviet Official in order to cover himself "in case anything
happened".

6. This Soviet Official has evinced an interest to
Subject in many of the American Exchange students, with the
explanation that some would undoubtedly be back in Moscow
within two years as Diplomats and that since this is his
area of responsibility, he wants to know as much as possible
about them. The Soviet indicated that he was quite aware of
the pattern of the American Exchange students' trips to the
US Embassy and what they do in the university buildings, but
is not so sure of their activities around the city. To
demonstrate to Subject his knowledge about the American
students, the Soviet Official mentioned an affair going on
within the American group of which Subject had been unaware.
The Soviet's information turned out to be true.

7. Subject was described by a reliable source, who
knows him from group social gatherings at Harvard, as mature
and socially vivacious with a warm personality. Subject is
a clever and humorous conversationalist who likes to be
——-...__surrounded by people, make new acquaintances, and develop
friendships. Subject's patriotic motivation was not known
to our source, but the latter felt that Subject was completely
"Americanized" in manners and interests. Our source would
guess that Subject has courage.

8. It is requested that no further dissemination be
made of this information without prior clearance from this
office. It is further requested that such clearance be
obtained if Subject is to be contacted by you either before
or after his return to the United States.

1. Reference is made to our CSCI 3/751,690 of 27 October

ported the attempt by Czech Intelligence to induce Subject, a
Czech-born naturalized American, to repatriate to Czechoslovakia,
and the further cultivation of Subject by the KGB in Moscow
where Subject is an Exchange Student during 1958-59. The
following report describes further action by the KGB to recruit
Subject, and his adamant refusal of any such offer. This latest
information was recently received from RIHA by a sensitive
and reliable source. r

4 % 7
2. During April 1959, the Soviet Ofticial-who-said-ie---~
was from the American Section of the MVD (sic) and who had been
cultivating Subject, allegedly asked the-‘latter to make complete
and regular reports on Michael Mertin*LUTHER, one of the other
American Exchange Students at Mosco sity. Subject was
asked to spend as much time as possible with LUTHER, and to
report where he goes, what he does and with whom he associates.
If Subject were to do this reporting, the Soviet Official
said he would make available certain material from Archives
which Subject has been unable to get permission to use although
research in this material is vital to his having a successful
year academically in Moscow,

3. Subject alleges he flatly refused this "deal", saying -~...
that if he ever got mixed up in such a dirty business, it would
be for his own side and not for the Communists. The Soviet
Official then told Subject he should engage in such observation
and reporting to the Soviets to lose some "naivcte" about how.
the United States is exploiting the Cultural Exchange Program
for intelligence purposes. To back up this assertion, the
Soviet Official told Subject about a "spy nest where spies deposit
things for one another" which he said had recently been uncovered
near a university entrance frequented by still another American
student, Walter+CLEMENS, who, the Soviet implied, was not engaged
in academic work only” While studying at Moscow University.



Subject reportedly again adamantly refused to cooperate with
the Soviet Official.

: 4, In paragraph 4 of CSCI 3/754,303, reference'.was. made -
‘to a Soviet girl who had become interested in Subject, and whom
Subject viewed with suspicion although continuing to see her
for her companionship. Her name is Lida (Y)EGOROVA. Subject
has now reportedly bcen alienated by~iver-unde able personality
I and has pretty well broken up with her. This girl may have
——~~-left, or soon be leaving, for Prague to join her husband.

information be made without prior clearance from this office.
It is further requested that such clearance be obtained if
Subject is to be contacted by you.

This article was a general rehashing of the Riha case.

Morley was asked if Detiver’ had information concerning

who was there when. Rika disappeared. He said that Smiley

He said Denver had no information that Dr. Smiley has any

James "Hike" McKevitt interviewed 5/5/70 as to investigation of
Riha, Czechoslovak~born, naturalized, former professor of Russian
history at Colorado University, who departed Denver area 3/69
without notifying friends, associates or estranged wife. His
_disappearance has been glamorized and spiced up in newspaper
articles by references to Galya Tannenbaum, his paramour, “NcKevitt
| stated investigation at standstill, all leads being exhausted. He

\ feels Tannenbaum may have killed subject since bad feeling developed

| between them prior to his disappearance due to her forging checks

}]on his account. Further, Tannenbaum probably a nymphomaniac who

1) had constant sexual affairs with Riha and used this as a club over
his head to prevent disclosure of forgeries. In MeKevitt's opinion
Rihe is dead since he was close to his friends and if alive would
contact them, Investigation indicates Riha abnormal in his sexual |
desires and could not leave women alone. Possibility exists one fe

. After leaving Boulder, SMILEY was advised by
1{ Dean WILLIAM £, BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences,

:f University of Colorado, Boulder, that a letter was

‘. weceived by the University purportedly written by RIJA,

in which he stated that he would not be returning to

the University. BRIGGS advised SMILEY that in his

opinion, the letter was a forgery, since the signature a
did not compare witb that of RIJA. i

-After the disappearance, SMILEY began receiving
a great many inquiries from the news media and he was
pressed for a statenent regarding his knowledge of RIJA
and whether or not he was alive. :

: -. THE FOLLOWING WAS FURNISHED BY DR, SMILEY
IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING -
THAT IT WAS FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE FBI AND NOT
FOR DISSEMINATION TO ANY OUTSIDE AGENCY SINCE HE WAS
BREAKING A CONFIDENCE WITH AN ASSOCIATE IN THE DENVER

ENXCY >

_OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL INTHLLIGENCE AGENC

Being hounded by the press for a statement,
.he contacted a source in the CIA Office at Denver since
he, SMILEY, was formerly a member of the Office of Naval
Intelligence, thinking that perhaps that agency could
assist him off the record with any information it might
“possess, SMILEY was aware that the CIA had interviewed
RIJA following a trip by RIJA to the Soviet Union. The
CIA source subsequently told Dr, SMILEY to merely advise -
: the press that he had information to the effect that
_ _ RIJA was “alive and well", - This information was subsequently
ae released by Dr, SMILEY to the student press at the University
of Colorado, and it appeared in print.

: When the Office of: the District Attorney in
Denver instituted investigation into the disappearance
of RIJA, SMILEY was contacted by the DA's Office regarding
the source of his statenent. Dr. SMILEY again contacted
the Denver CIA Office source and was advised that he
was to state nothing and that he would be recontacted,

Some days later, the CIA sovrce recontacted
him and told hin that he would be receiving an inquiry
fron the Office of the DA in the form of a statement,
and that he should agree with the statement even though
4t “was not quite the truth". SMILEY did not question

ERG EEE ET a ICT rrreeeroerretas cee ae


HW 55322 Docld:32989714 Page 133

these instructions, since he felt that CIA knew what
should be done in this type of case. He received a
‘telephone call from the DA's Office and a statement

. was read to him to the effect that the information

which he had received and made public to the effect
that RIJA was alive and well was in error. SHILEY
told the caller that he agreed with the statement and
nothing further came of this.

: Dr, SMILEY does not know what part, if any,
the CIA-has in’ this case, but since ho, SMILEY, is
hinself a former intelligence agent he did not feel
that he had the right to question something which
might be a vital importance to his country. —

DR. SUILEY REQUESTED THAT NO HINT OR
"INFERENCE BE GIVEN TO THE CIA WHICH WOULD INDICATE
“THAT HE HAS REVEALED TO THE FBI HIS CONTACTS REGARDING
THIS MATTER WITH THE DENVER OFFICE OF THE CIA,

He stated that though he has no evidence to
substantiate his belief, he cannot get it out of his
mind that RIJA may have been a double agent for the
Soviets or the Czechoslovaks. He is aware that one
Urs, TANNENBAUM, a woman indicted for a number of frauds
and a suspect in two arsenic poisonings, is considered
® suspect in the disappearance of RIJA, He never knew
RIJA to be associated with any such woman, but stated
that he was not acquainted with the personal life of
RIJA who was somewhat of a "loner",

.  RIJA, when he joined the staff of the Univers‘ity

of Colorado, was single but in 8/68, an individeal came

to visit RIJA ostensibly for the purpose of arrang
a@ marriage between RIJA and the man's sister. The
intended bride was 2a Czechosiovakian girl who was born in
- Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this "brother-in-law" was

- entertained by a member and colleague of RIJA in the
History Departrent. This individual indicated to SMILEY
that although the “brother-in-law" supposedly did not
Speak any English, and had RIJA translate every statement
into Czech, it was apparent from the gestures anc expressions
of the “brotker-in-law" that he understood more than he

let on. Three. weeks after the visit of this man, the voran
who became Mrs, RIJA cane to Boulder, Colorado, whera ste
and RIiJA were married, The marriage resulted in divorce
a short time later and the girl reportedly returned -

the East conse from whence she cane. :

‘Dr. SUILEY indicated that he has no further
information regarding this matter, but that Dean WILLIAM EB.
BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences, University of
Colorado, Boulder, should be in possession of the letter
purportedly written from Canada by RIJA, and may be in
& position to assist in answering any question the Bureau
might have regarding RIJA's association with the University
of Colorado, since BRIGGS would have possession of these
records, He stated BRIGGS is a trusted confidant of his
and Dr, SUILEY's name should be used as an introduction
should the Bureau desire any infornation of BRIGGS.

‘RR: DEMONSTRATION AT FEDERAL BUILDING, . —.—
AKHON, OHIO, JANUARY 27, 1975 S

Reference is made to letter dated April 10, 1975,
to the Attorvey General from the Chairnan of captioned
subcomiitice. Item two on page two of this letter refers to
an attachment setting forth quostions to which Congressman
John F. Seiborling requested responses concerning BI

. participation in the demonstration reforenced above, .

Prior to the actual questions, a description of
Svonts survounding this denonstration was set forth, which:
had been provided by Congressman Seiborling curing questions
asked of FBI Directer Clarence i, Kelley during the hearing
on tho oversight of the FBY held on February 27, 1975,
Congressman Seiveri considered
accurate, with the following wxceptionsa: :

In connection with the statement, "At sore point
during January, 1075, there was a bomb threat against the
new Federal Office Ruilding in Akron," the Cleveland
Office of tha PBI, which is the headauartors office of tha
FBE Resident Agency at Akron, Ohio, has advised a review
oz its records fails to indicate that any information
concerning a borb threat against the Pedorai building in

. 4erdn was received during January, 1575, and uo action
taken by the ¥BI regarding this demonstration was related
to any bomb threat.

Concerning the statement, "On January 27, a grotp
of six to eight pcople denonstrated outside the building.
against continued U. S. assistance to South Vietnam,” it is
noted that FBI records indicate approximately 15 persons
participated in the demonstration,

Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights
of the House Committee on the Judiciary

Responses to the aforementioned questions are set
forth below and appear in the same order as posed.

1. The FBI conducts surveillances of denonstrations
occurring on or near Federal property; at other locations
when facts indicate a violation of Federal statutes over
which the fii has investigative jurisdiction may occur; or
at a site where individuais of investigative interest to
the FSi are present or the demonstration is sponsored by
an organization of investigative interest. in this instance,
the £2 had ceceived information from a source, who hag
provided roliable’ information in the past, that an organiza-
tion of investigative interest to the FUI would be attempting
to gain publicity by entering the Foderal Building ia Abron, -
ereating disturbances and defacing Federal property. This
organization has been deternincd to be infiuenced by a
separate organization which esmouses a basic lnvxisi-
Leninist-Naoist revolutionary ideolesy. Investigation of
both of these organizations is based on information which
Andicates they my be engaged in activities which could
involve violations of Title 18, United States Code,

Sections 2suy (kepeiiion or Insucreciiou}, 2904 (seditious
Conspiracy), 2385 (Advocating Overthrow o£ Government), and
2387 (Sedition). In addition, inasmuch as the possibility
‘ existed individuals present at the demonstration would
attexnt to deface Federal property, there was reason to
believe a violation of Title 18, United States Coda,
Section 1361 (Destruction ef Government Property) could occur,
At a later date, additional dnformation was recoived from a
second source, who has provided relisble information in the
past, that the demonstration at the Federal Building in Akron
would be to protest United States involveucat in Southeast
Asia, and jeaficts urging sort of this demonstration wers
being distriputed in the Airon-Kent, Ohio, aren. In z
keeping with existing FEI policy, the Akvon Police Department
and the Genorel Services Administration Building Manager in
charms of the Akron Federal building were notificd of the :
impending demonstration and of information received indicating
@ possibility that disruptive activity wouid occur during
the denonstration. :

Surveillance in this case was not related to any

bomb threat; however, based on the information stated above, say

there was reason for the FSI to suspect that there might ke
violations of Federal-statutes over which the FSI has investi=
gative juvisdiction. In the event such viclations did occur,
it would be necessary that Agents be present to gather | the
necessary evidence 7

fhe FBI did have an interest relating to the
Adentitics of the particular individuals who were involved
in crganizing the demonstration. ‘Une such individual, who

Both prints and negatives of photographs taken by
the TEI have bean maintained, from the timo processed, as
exhibits in records of the FDi's Cleveland Office. The
film was developed because, among the approximately 15
denonstrators present outsice the Akron Fedsral Building, ©
Agents recognised five individuals known to be affiliated
with tho organization in which the PBI had investigative
interest. In tha event photographs depicting these individuais
were of better quality than existing photographs, the improved
ones would be, in accordance with For policy and in line with

an agrecmont between the FBI and the Secret Service concerning -

Presidential protection, forwarded to the Secret Service for
possibile future use by that asency in connection with its
responsibilitics, The photographs obtained, however, were
not suitable for this purposs.

Prints of those photographs were net meade avaliable
to the Akron Police Department, were not forwarded to FBI
Headquarters in Washington, D. C., and were not made available
to anyone else, ‘These prints were not retained at the Akron”

“FBI Resident Agency, but were sent ta the Clevcland FEI

Office and are maintained in the rises of that oifics,

3. The Akron FBI Resident Agency did make an

‘ attempt to identify the unknown participants in the

demonstration from the photograplis taken during the demonstra=
tion, Information concerning the identities of some of the
denoustrators was provided by the Akron Resident Agency to
the Intolligence Division, Akron Police Department, for the
purpose of bringing to their attention tha identities of those
individual participants who have been iavolved in disruptive
activities in the past and who may becore so involved again
in the future. me of the individuals so identizied to the
Akron Police Department has reportedly urged “spontaneous
violence" at a demonstration in the past. :

Files of the FEI are not maintained at the Resident
Agency level; thorefors, information concerning the identities
of scene of the dexonstrators has been placed and is being
Maintained in tho files of the Cleveland FBI Office.

4. It is believed the FBI should retain photographs
and information gathered concerning the identities of
demonstrators following a dexonstration in which the

presence of the FEI is justified, even — though such demonstra=
tion onds peacofully with no arrests and no violations of?
either Federal or iccal statutes. In the few selective ~  --
-instances in which demonstrations have been photegraphed,

&@ supstantive reason has existed justifying the use of
photography. in this instance, photography was utilized

in anticipation of comission of a Federal offense and in
connecticn with the investigation of an organization, and
individuals affiliated thereyith, on whom the rBi was
conducting investigation under the statutes mentioned herein.

Additionally, information of this nature is
maintained in accordance with thea records retention plan
furnished the Fai by the National Archives and Records
Servico during 1959. This plan identified categories of
records which were considered to have a permanent value and
which should bo retained indefinitely by the FBI. Included
wore these records involving crimes of treason, insurrection

havé sometimes arisen comparatively iate in the investigative or prosecutive

In view of these experieiices, it appears necessary and desirable

‘Mr. DeLoach)

: In connection with problems arising out of past
electronic surveillance coverage of individuals now under
prosecution, or against whom prosecution is being conten-
plated, the Department, as you know, made a general request
that we establish an “early warning system" in the form of
‘an, index or other administrative device to enable a check
to be made to determine if we have so monitored the voices
of such individuals, The Department was advised that we
had such a system in operation. :

ry Yn line with the Department's requirements, this
iindex, which is now in operation, is made up of names of
Lindividuals whose voices were monitored by microphone
isurveillances, technical surveillances, or other similar
electronic listening devices since January, 1960. =

As you know, the Department has recently forwarded

| a list of 151 names of individuals currently of prosecutive

interest in the Tax Division, with a request that these names.
i be checked through our index to determine if they were the
$, subjects of direct electronic surveillance ‘coverage; whether
an individual in question appears on any records, logs, notes,
memoranda, et cetera, either as a participant in conversations
overheard, or as a person mentioned or discussed.

Criminal Division has never required any information concerning

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
Re: Microphone and Telephone Surveillances

{) an additional example of the Tax Division going far beyond
4

j{what is required by the courts or even by another division of
+; the Department. Nevertheless, in order to answer any inquiries
.falong this line with the dispatch desired, it will be necessary

| |to include in our index the names of persons mentioned in
microphone logs.

Attached is a communication to the field divisions
\tanvolved, alerting those offices to this additional requirement
tion the part of the Tax Division and instructing those offices
;,to prepare index cards on individuals who are mentioned in
Ijmonitorea conversations.

| The field is being instructed to use a certain amount

of common sense in recording names in this category inasmuch as
there are literally thousands of instances in which a subject
covered engages in completely inconsequential conversations in
which he may mention the name ofa third party. Examples of
this would be instructions to a maid or servant to get in
touch with a particular merchant or serviceman to handle menial
errands such .as handling dry cleaning, getting a car washed and
like situations. Where a name is mentioned in this way, no

f purpose is served by including it in this index. We are, of

* course, following the Director's instructions in connection
with furnishing everything of possible pertinence to the
Department and allowing Department personnel, not FBI personnel,

j determine if it is relevant. : 7 :

ACTION:

Attached for your approval is an airtel to offices
involved in the compilation of this index, instructing that
cards also be prepared on all individuals who are mentioned
or discussed in monitored conversations, except those in the
completely inconsequential category cited above, in addition
to names of individuals already being included as those whose
voices have been monitored. 7

immediately notify Mr. J. Walier Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General,
| Internal Security Division.

With reference to this subject matter the Bureau is currently
handling numerous requests from-ithe Department to-check the names of
various subjects against the special indices set up at the Bureau on all
persons who have been subject of any FBI electronic surveillance. It
is expected that any cases questioned by the United States Attorneys
and referred to Mr. Yeagley will be given the same examination on the
request of the Department. :

Although instructions to the United States Attorneys by the
Acting Attorney General do not specifically require contact with the
various investigative agencies at the field leve}, it is quite likely that
some of our field offices will receive inquiries from the United States
Attorneys. In case such inquiries are received by field affices requesting
that information obtained from electronic surveillances be’ furnished,’ the
Bureau should be immediately advised of the request and all’pertinent .
details. No response should be made to the United States Attorneys in
| _ Such instances without prior Bureau authorization. This procedure is

“nécessary in view of the possibility that the subject of a case may have
been in some way covered by an electronic surveillance in a field office
not, participating in investigation of the prosecutive case in question.

district court, the question whether other conversations (i.e. ;
conversations not involving an attorney-client bella ee

which were overheard as a result of the listening device
installed in his suite furnished any leads‘or evidence

in his case. At an appropriate hearing, the government
proposes to submit all of the facts upon which a full
judicial determination can be made. '

"This Department must never procecd with any investigation or
case which includes evidence iiiegally obtained or the fruits of that
evidence. No investigation or case of that character shall go forward
until such evidence and all of its fruits have been purged and we are in
@ position to assure ourselves and the court that there is no taint or
unfairness. We must, also, scrupulously avoid any situation in which

‘an intrusion into a confidential relationship would deny a fair hearing

- to adefendant or person under investigation.

y

"For this reason we are in the process of requesting each
investigative agency concerned to review its files in order to determine
whether there has been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching
a particular case or matter. We are making a similar review of cases
and matters pending in the Department. You will be informed im-
mediately whenever a case or matter in your office is found to fall
in this category. - ; j

"Many matters are referred directly to your offices by the
investigating agencies. Special attention must he given to these. But,
it is imperative that you and your assistants make every effort to
ascertain whether any cases, now pending or hereafter received, present
the problem of wiretapping or electronic surveillance. No single means
of checking is infallible but you should keep in mind that the same
person or matter may have been investigated by several Federal or
* State agencies and the information supplied to you may in fact come
from more than one source. You should be particularly atientive 4
to those cases which involve, directly or indirectly, hard core elements
of organized crime.
“Wr 55322° DocId:32989714 Page 189



"It is, of course, the very rare case--one out of thousands-~
in which you will encounter the problem to which this memorandum is s
addressed. The problem will arise in cases in which some investigation
was conducted prior to July, 1965. Present practice, . adopted inJuly =:
1965 in confirmity with the policies declared by President Johnson on

June 30, 1965.for the entire Federal establishment, prohibits the
installation of listening devices in private areas (as well as the
interception of telephone and other wire communications) in all
instances other than those involving the collection of intelligence
affecting the national security. The specific authorization of the
Attorney General must be obiained in each inctance when this
exception is invoked. Intelligence data so collected will not be
available for investigative or litigative. purposes.

"If you have any reason whatever to believe that there has
‘been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching a particular case,
you should immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant
Attorney General, Internal Security Division, so that further inquiry
_ Inay, be pursued by the Department."

Organized Crime and Racketeering cases
pending in the Tax Division.

- As has been discussed with Mr. DeLoach, we are
anxious to obtain information regarding the possibility
that tainted evidence has inadvertently been used by
us in the prosecution of criminal tax cases, or exists

: in cases currently being considered by us for prosecu-
tion. Under the assumption that if this exists at all,
Organized Crime and Racketeering cases are the most :
likely source, the attached list relates to criminal
cases pending in the Tax Division which appear to be
Organized Crime Drive matters. Some of these matters
are currently under consideration as to whether prosecu-
tion game hawe been referred to
the United States Attorneys for prosecutive action; some
are the subjects of indictments, and a few are pending
on appeal. ;

ny

' i . It is requested that the names on the attached list

Hbe checked against the indices which you have set up in
relation to electronic listening devices and you advise

iithis office as soon as possible whether any name on this - in
diist appears on — indices.

We wish to know:

whether the named defendant shows, up ain,

a)
; your indices;
b) whether he was the direct subject of,

electronic surveillance; and
3)"Whether he appears on any recordings,
,transecripts, logs, notes, memoranda, ox”
“other records as a participant in con-
versations overheard or as a person
mentioned or discussed.

DocId:32989714 Page 194

b)

If an individual's name on our list is found
in your indices, we would like to be advised:

the duration of the surveillance, and

ce) if any of such records are in existence

that they all be made available to us.

T£ any information was obtained from elec~
tronic surveillance, to your knowledge was
such information communicated in any manner
to the Internal Revenue Service?

a) I£ so, to whom was the communication

made; when was it made, and what is
the nature of the information com-
municated?

These matters are under the jurisdiction of the
Criminal Section of the Tax Division and any questions

the nature of the surveillance involved,”

relating to the foregoing requests can be directed to me,
to Mr. Richard M. Roberts, Second Assistant, Tax Division,
or Mr. Fred G. Folsom, Chief of our Criminal Section.
Roberts and Mr. Folsom are designated as attorneys who may
receive the information and records requested in this

This system will enable each office to determine
. @lectronic surveillance coverage of individuais, as in the past,
.and the blue card will be easily recognizable as coverage under
a& court approved electronic surveillance, These cards are to
be subnitted to the attention of the Special Investigative Division,
pest -Crininal Intelligence and Organized Crime Section, each Friday
in line with existing instructions, : .

You will note that, as to each individual on whom a
_card is prepared, the card must indicate whether or not the
. individual was the subject of direct coverage, a participant in
“. convorsation or méationed by others who were monitored. Only
. one of the last three items on the index cards should be utilized.
: ¢ :
The Bureau requires only ‘one card in the special indices
. for’ an individual monitered or mentioned in conversation covered
-by an installation. Ifthe individual was monitored or mentioned
_in conversation by more than one installation, a separate card
must be submitted on each individual ror each installation.

In the event an index card is forwarded, disclosing
an individual was mentioned in a conversation covered by an
electronic device and subsequently the individual is monitored
a ‘by the sane device, an appropriate index card reverling this
coversge must be forwarded. It is not necessary to list all
dates on which he was monitored by a particular source, only the
‘first date. ,

_ Each source will be identified as to ee district
where the court order was approved followed by a number starting
“with number 1 for the first order, and each subsequent order °
receiving one number larger. In addition, the abbreviation for’

administrative precedures are established for such handling... -

(A) INDEX SYSTEMS -- Inan important case with great public
interest, an individual was not identified because of the failure of
an office to properly index a nickname.

. Recent court decisions have resulted in the public
disclosure of electronic surveillance logs and related material
which heretofore were confidential. The information in these
surveillance matters is being afforded close scrutiny by the news
media, the general public, Federal, state, and local officials;
therefore, the importance of proper indexing has hecome
increasingly significant.

Each Special Agent in Charge will be held strictly
resporisible for insuring that ali names, nicknames, and aliases
appearing in electronic surveillance logs and related material

* are properly indexed in accordance with the instructions set forth

in Part II, Section 3, page 4, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

: has vronosed that the develooment of informants in the Ku Klux
Xlan (KIS) and other hate groups as weil as the investigation ana penecration of these
organizations from an intelligence siandpoint be transferred from the General
Investizative Division to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). He bases his
recommendations on the premise that organizations like the KXX and supporting
groups are essentially suoversive in that they hold principles and recommend courses
of action that are inimical to the Constitution as are the viewpoints of the Communis<
‘Party. -He does -not maintain that the.actions.of.the hate groups constitute the same
menace as the Communist Party inasmuch as they are not controlled by a foreim
power. - censtuseue,eeeeaee iblee eerauere = 7 an

is e@-. -

He feels that the DID over the years has developed wide experience in the
penetration of subversive organizations through informants; anonymous sources,
sophisticated microphone and technical surveiliances, interview programs of
a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his division could put this experience .
to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups. '

" “feels that the DID would be in a position to launch a
disruptive counter-intelligence program against the ian and other hate groups
with the same effectiveness that they are now doing insofar as the Communist Party gy
is concerned. He alse proposes an immediaie series of regional conferences to
instruct pertinent fieid personnel and to devise imaginative, aggressive and hishiv
specialized prozrams to carry out the responsibilities in question. He states the
Communist Party is increasing its activities in the field of racial miters and
civil rights, direczinz more and more of its fire against the ICXX and similar i
organizations to confuse the issue. He feels that because of the stepped up . '
activilics of the Communist Party in this arca it would help prevent marked confusion
from developing in the areas of activities being handled by the General Investigative
and Domestic Intelligence Divisions if the DID assumes these responsibiiitics.

The functions in question were formerly handled by the DID up until 1952
when they were transferred to the Gencrai Investigative Division. This matter wa"

considered by, the, Susgertives Gaplerence 10/1/56 and the transter recommenced. f

feels that there is a Goaccey toward oversimplification
blaming all racial murders on Klansmen and hate groups. He points out that the
ders of Medgar Evers, Postman Moore and even the assassination of President
mnedy were initially and generally attributed to Klan and hate gm up members
wreas iuvestigation showed that the individuals charged with the murders of |
ers and Moore were without organization aifiliation and the Pred dent was
ain by an avowed Marxist who was active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

and)” both agree that the investigation of individual
ses, i.e. bombings, rnurders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the
neral Investigative Division. feels that whether subject or victims

e Klan memvers, Communist Party members or completely without organizational
filiation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights :
olation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment,

functions in question ihe basis was,the close inter-relationship between the
‘tivities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investigation.
2 feels this argument has even more strength today than in 1958, because, over-
nelmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with i
tegration and civil rights. : believes the transfer of functions would ;
‘eate an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance i
break major civil rights cases such as bombings, murders, etc., is through ane |

e policy’ of aggressively seeiting out persons addicted to violence even thouzh they
ve not violated a Federal-law as‘yet. He feels that the Division that is going to
vestigate these cases should forge the necessary tools to use for this purpose.

does not fee! that the transfer of this responsibility will be helpful to the
ureau from an investigative stancpoint nor in meeting the keavy-res ponsibilities we now
ve in this area. 7 . sanann!

EWS OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION:

feels there is certainly some merit and logic in. >
téasoning and it is felt instant issue is not one that is completely black or white.

«
Under the present setup there is codrdination and daily exchange of
Information between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions
that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information
‘e brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which
ach Division is primurily respousible.: However, it seems the real issue today
ist. as+in.1958, is where.does the weight-oi.the interest lie in the racial question.
in 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, according to
ormation available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had
icitl incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Party elements although
he Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also,
m 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations.

Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic
telligence Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest
a the racial problem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be
xploiting it to an ever-increasing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights
Ee other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is definite
eed for an intelligence typé penetration of these racial and hate groups so as
0 keep abreast of and ahead of their plans and activities. This seems more
roperly the function of the seicttinesaeee Intelligence Division.

Analysis was made by cow -relative to coverage of the Klan and other
ate groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of
ressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed
he field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on ceriain xey
Man figures, Inve interviewed ai least once all inown Klan members, all Klan
eaders have been investizated from intelligence standpoint and recommendations
lave been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member. A
ce! Kkly progress airtel is being obtained from field concerning informant development.
However, undoubtedly additional coverage is neéded particularly i in the Klaverns
bab hawesbeen formed inceagbcsd vil rights bill passed. There is no question avout

} aeeer



Meino for Mr. Tolson e — ) ainiaah ee
Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups _ : :

the fact that the DID has had broad experience in the penetration of subversive
organizations and has achieved noteworthy results in‘infiltrating the Communist -
Party and Soviet intelligence operations. It is felt that unquestionably this
experience and know-how could be put to good advantage in penetrating the Klan.
and other hate $roups. ~

The Inspection Division feels that the advantages in having the
direction of all informant and intelligence matters in the vacial field in one division
as outlined by * and atweigh the advantages cf naving the
hate group informants and intelligence functions with the substantive civil rights cases.
Under the proposed transfer of phases of the racial problem'to Domestic Intelligence
Division there will still be definite responsibility: in both divisions,
to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and
other criminal violations. This dual responsibility, however, should pose no
problem because there are numerous examples of it successfully being handled
in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the administrative hamiling
of the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Speciai Investigative
Division which includes the informants being utilized on General Investigative
Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles
the informant and intelligence aspects of organized crime. However, the General
Investigative Division handles k Key substantive violations such as Bankruptcy,
Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theft from Interstate Shipment
violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing
Criminal Intelligence informa ants. It is understood that there have been no in-
soluble problems in this regard and it is felt that there should be no insoluble
problems in the coordination of racial intelligence and informant information’
between the General Investigative Division and the DID.

tn any event there will certainly be no lessening of pressure and.
supervision on the field if these functions are transferred. The same Agents
in the field will be working the cases and developing the informants. However,
it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their
broad knowledze of and experience in penetration techniques and infiltration
tactics can possibly increase our penetration of these hate groups. It is felt
that a study of counter-intelligence and Gisruption tactics against the Klan certainly
merits further consideration. It is aiso felt that the proposed series of field con-
ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

readjust. agree that the Research and Servicd functions, which will re
undexy * should be reassigned to the Training
Division, Ido not believe that this Section should be transferred to Quantico,
however, because there is daily need for access to iiles and.other material
: at Headquarters and occasional contacts with the public. Furthermore, there -
__ 13 no available space at Guantico except inthe Library Building. Accordingly, .
 Yrecommend that the FBIHQ Library.be moved into the Library Building at..1.:,
Guantico. We would need to retain at FBUIQ the telephone directories and
encyclopedias which are used on a daily basis by other Divisions. The =
space into which the FBIHQ Library was to have peen moved in the Sth and D
Building can be used and in fact is badly needed by the Domestic Intelligence
Division which is very crowded. : F :

Bureau Library at FBI Headquarters

A survey has been made of the library, its books, facility and
personnel. At the present time, the library is housed in six rooms in the 4200
corridor at FBI Headquarters and has a staff of the following: ‘|

‘

From a survey of the books, 411 books can be removed from the
library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books
and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maintained at FBI
Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters.
From the survey, it was determined these books can be. maintained jx two rooms”
presently occupied by the library, thus freeing four rooms as:gurplus spate”  -

“Ih the library is a lending library which has about 100 members. _
These members pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have the privilege
of using the library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, Iam proposin
that we phase out this part of the library during the next six months, removing the
books at the end of that period to Quantico. :

CIA's operation against Castro he personally contacted Robert
Maheu during the Fall of 1960 for the purpose of using Maheu
as a “cut-out” in contacts with Sam Giancana, a known noodlun
in the Chicago area, Colonel Xdwards said that since the
underworld controlled gambling activities in Cuba under the
Batista governnent, it was assumed that this element would
BELL Continue Y ntnete in Cuba which
perhaps could be utilized successfully in connection wiih
CIAts clandestine efforts against the Castro government.
‘fs a result, laheu's services were solicited as a "cut-out"
because of his possible entree into underworld circles.
Naheu obtained Sam Giancana's assistance in this regard and
according to Hdwards, Giancana gave every indication of
cooperating through Haheu in attempting to accomplish several
‘clandestine orts in Cuba. Edwards added that none of
Giancana's efforts have materialized to date and that several
of the plans still are working ard may eventually “pay off."

Golonel Edwards related that he had no direct
contact with Giancana; that Giancana'ts activities were
completely “back stopped" by Haheu and that Maheu would
frequently report Giancana's action and information to
Edwards. No details or methods used by Haheu or Giancana
in accomplishing their missions were ever reported to
Edwards. Colonel Sdwards said that since this is "dirty
business" he couid not afford to have knowledge of the actions
of Maheu and Giancana in pursuit of any mission for CIA,
Colonel Edwards added that he has neither given NMaheu any,
instruction to use technical installations of any type nor has
_the subject of technical installations ever come up between
Edwards and ig om in connection with Giancana's activity.

conversation, but "Johnny", although friendly, was anxious
to get to the point of his visit. The following is the essence
of "Johnny's'” story as he told it to Colonel Edwards.
“Colonel Edwards lct him talk freely and asked only a few
—+— questions since he did not consider it wise to interrogate
him or press him for further details, .
"Johnny" said that he had been approached on the street
‘in Los Angeles by an FBI agent named Dodge, who said he
wanted to talk to him.: He said that he told the agent that he
did not want to talk to him and kept on walking. Another
agent, named Hill joined "Johnny" and Dodge as they walked
",down the street. The agents told him that the interview had
" nothing to do with him personally and that they had nothing
against him. They tried to give him an envelope and a card.
"Johnny" said he told. them that if they had a legal document
fsuch as 2 summoane or eubgoona} b kh
law, but they would have to deal with his attorney or have
his attorney present. The agents said they wanted to talk
to him alone and said it had nothing to do with him personally.
They proposed that they meet him in a suburb in Los Angeles,
which "Johnny" said was ebout forty miles away (either at ©
. this point, or later through his attorney) they told him they
wanted to talk to him on a matter they knew he did not want
- an attorney to know. They said it was a matter of National
‘:. Security. He still refused a and they left him. aan

-"They left “him‘and when he got back to his apartment
the envelope was there. He said he did not open it but called
»-” his attorney and had him openit. The envelope contained a
/picture of a women and a child about four years old,
"Johnny" said-the child was himself-at that age (Colonel
“Edwards tried to get a little more detail on the envelope and
the woman, but "Johnny" was very touchy on this). .
“The eoltorney: sien fect has talked to the FBI

experience in these hetters) felt at the time and still feels

that this is not the orthodox approach of the FBI and he is

puzzled, He Said to Golonel Edwards that if he did talk to

the FBI, he.was not going to tcll them anything relating to

i _ National Security (this was volunteered and Colonel Edwards
: did.not advise on this point either pro or con).

"After "Johnny" had finished his tale, Colonel Edwards
‘asked him if he were being told this in confidence. "Johnny"
said no, that Colonel Edwards could tell anyone he wished.
a, . Inthis regard, Colonel Edwards gave no advice and made

aati no commitment. He did tell him that he might tell his suc-
“/" 4. eessor (the undersigned) as a matter of information.

-"Golonel Edwards! estimat€ of this development is that
"Johnny" is in some kind of "bind" personally. Colonel

to New York together). a

Although "Johnny" did not say so, Colonel Edwards is of the

be inadequate. The President would iike to knew what resources
we presently have targeted toward monitoring foreign Communist
support of revolutionary youth activities in this country, hov

w: effective they are, what gaps in our intelligence exist because

a of either inadequate resources or a low priority of attention,

and what steps could be taken, if he directed, to provide

the maximum possible coverage of these activities.

RE: FOREIGN SUPPORT FOR REVOLUTIONARY. PROTEST
MOVEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES

“ Qur report shows that the FBI has been aware from
the inception of the New Left and black extremist movements
‘that they pose new and unique threats to our internal security.
It shows we have readjusted our investigative intelligence
efforts to ccpe with the new problems created. It stresses
the fact that these movements are developing increasingly
into hard-core revolutionary elements which will demand
Still greater attention in the form of increased coverage
as it appears there will be increasingly closer links between
these movements and foreign communists in the future,

We have prepared a transmittal letter to Mr. Huston
submitting our report. Inasmuch as this document is not going
directly to the President, no copy is being forwarded to the
Attorney General at this Vine. oa

ACTION:

With your saenveat the attached report and letter

Chairman, Subcommittee on Adminis-—
trative Practice & Procedure
Committee on the Judiciary
Washington, D. C. 20520

Md Senator Kennedy: _

In response to your letter of April 24, 1975, I am
presently able to provide you with most of the information
you have requested concerning the electronic surveillance

‘activities of federal departments and agencies. The in-
formation contained in this letter and the enclosed material
relates mainly to electronic surveillance conducted within

. the United States pursuant to tke criminal law enforcement
responsibilities of the federal government. It does not
include electronic surveillance that may be conducted either
in the interests of national security, or outside the United
States by federal departments and agencies other than the
‘Department of Justice. As to these latter areas, the De-
‘partment is still in the process of assembling and review-
ing the materials relevant to your request, and we are thus
unable at this time to determine what information we may be
able to provide. I should note that in several instances
your letter requests information that is either not in the
‘possession of this Department or pertains to areas outside
its proper jurisdiction. Since I understand that you have
sent similar letters to other federal departments and agen-
cies, I expect that you will receive responses from them.
‘Nevertheless, I believe the information contained in this
letter and the enclosed material will answer in substantial
part the questions you have raised concerning electronic
surveillance..

Apart from the area of national security, electronic
surveillance conducted within the United States by federal
@epartments and agencies may be divided into two broad

on
categories: consensual and non-consensyal. Consensual
electronic surveillance refers to those instances in which
one, or more parties to the communication is a federal agent,
is. ‘cooperating with a federal agent, ox has consented to

the surveillance. Tho Supreme Court has repeatedly held

that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply to consensual surveillance. See, e.g., United
States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971); Lopez v. White, 373
U.S. 427 (1963); Rathbun v. United States, 355 U.S. 107
(1957); On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747 (1952). Con-
gress has also excepted consensual electronic surveillance
from the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the requirement
of a court order. Thus, sections 2511(a)(c) and (a) of Title
18 of the United States Code provide:

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this
. chapter for a person acting under color of law
| to intercept a wire or oral communication, where
. such person is a party to the communication or
one of the parties to the communication has given
prior consent to such interception.

: (a) It shall not be unlawful under. this
chapter for a person not acting under color of
law to intercept a wire or oral communication
where such person is a.party to the communication
or, where one of the parties to the communication

_has given prior consent to such interception un~--
ess such communication is intercepted for-the
purpose of committing any criminal or tortious

; act in violation of the Constitution or laws of

7 ., the United States or of any State or for the pur-
i
|

pose of committing any other injurious act.

Although consensual electronic surveillance may thus
be conducted without a court order, its use by federal agents
has been subject to regulations issued by the Attorney | General
since 1967. The current regulations are specified in Attorney
General Kleindienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 entitled
“Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Départments and Agencies,

Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with the Consent of

a Party," and in a subsequent amending order issued by
Attorney General Saxbe. Copies of the memorandum and order
are enclosed herein.

In general, all federal agencies and departments
are required to obtain advance authorization from either
the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal
Division, or Deputy Assistant Attorney General of that
Division before any electronic device may be used to over-
hear, transmit, or record a private conversation, other than
a telephone conversation, without the consent of all the
.parties to that conversation. In exigent circumstances
precluding a prior request for authorization ~- such as
imminent loss of essential evidence or a threat to the
immediate safety of an agent or informant -- emergency
monitoring may be instituted with the authorization of the
head of the responsible department or agency or his designee.
The Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, how-
ever, must be notified promptly of any such monitoring and
of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining prior
approval. 7

The above procedures do not apply to consensual moni-
. toring of telephone conversations. Because they involve the
transmission of a participant's voice through a complex and
far-reaching network of wires, the common use of party lines
and extension telephones, and the possibility of an unseen
participant permitting another person to listen on the same
extension, telephone conversations have long been thought
not to enjoy the same expectation of privacy as face-to-face
conversations. For this reason, supervision and control over
consensual monitoring of telephone conversations are vested
instead in the: head of each federal department and agency,
who is required to adopt appropriate regulations and pro-
cedures on the subject. These regulations usually do not
restrict consensual monitoring of telephone conversations in
any significant respect. The relevant regulations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration are enclosed herein. :

\

The current regulations issued by the Attorney
General also require the head of each federal department
and, agency to exercise responsibility for the security of
all consensual monitoring devices, including the maintenance
of current inventories as to amounts, storage, and users of
such equipment, and to submit to the Attorney General dur-
ing July of each year a report containing an inventory of
all electronic and mechanical equipment designed for the
monitoring of conversations and a brief statement of the
results obtained from their use during the prior fiscal year.

All federal departments and agencies having criminal
investigative responsibilities .are authorized to conduct con-
sensual electronic surveillance. These agencies include,
inter-alia, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the
Bureau of Customs, the Department of Agriculture, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the

Cs Drug Enforcement Administration, the Postal Service, the
Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Naval Investi-

* gative Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

and the Department of Interior, The number of consensual
uses of electronic surveillance devices authorized by the

; Department of Justice between 1970 and 1974 is set forth in

7 the attached memoranda. The total annual authorizations were
as follows: 1970, 512; 1971, 840; 1972, 1272; 1973, 1484;
1974, 2518. In the first quarter of 1975, the total number
of authorizations was 1,125. In March 1975, the total author-
ized was 461. The above figures, of course, do not include
consensual monitoring of telephone conversations. Nor do
they include consensual electronic surveillance that may be
conducted either outside the United States or in the inter-
ests of national security.

“ Apart from the area of national security and foreign
intelligence, non-consensual electronic surveillance within
the United States is conducted pursuant to a court order.
Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

.. Act of 1968, the Attorney General may authorize an applica-
« tion to a federal judge of a competent jurisdiction, who may

ment of Justice. With the exception of the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration, no division, bureau, or agency of

this Department conducts electronic surveillance outside
the United States for any purpose, including national
security. The Drug Enforcement Administration does con-
duct electronic surveillance outside the United States in
certain limited circumstances. This surveillance is pres-
ently ‘undertaken only on a bilateral basis, that is, with
the approval and participation of the foreign country in-.
volved. It is my understanding, however, that a predecessor
organization of DEA did conduct non-consensual electronic
surveillance unilaterally in at least one instance occurring
in 1973. The surveillance was initiated in connection with
‘that organization's criminal law enforcement responsibilities
and was designed to obtain information concerning inter-
national drug traffickers. The subject of the surveillance
was a foreign national, and not an American citizen or an
alien resident of the United States. °

i Under its current policy, DEA does not conduct any
non-consensual electronic surveillance abroad without the
approvel and participation of the foreign country. In al-
most all cases, the surveillance is actually conducted by
law enforcement officials of the foreign country, rather
than by DEA, and is not initiated as the result of a request
by DEA. I am informed that the instances in which DEA has
been responsible in any way for electronic surveillance
conducted abroad are exceedingly few, and that in none of
these was the subject of the surveillance an American citizen
or an alien resident of the United States.

Under existing regulations, the approval of the U.S.
Chief of Mission in the host country is required before DEA
may conduct, or request a foreign country to conduct, non-
consensuaj. electronic surveillance outside the United States.
In addition, I have ordered that henceforth DEA shall obtain
the prior approval of the Attorney General before conducting,
or requesting anyone else to conduct, non-consensual elec-
tronic surveillance outside the United States where the sub-
ject of the surveillance is an American citizen or alien resi-

HW 55322‘ DocId:32989714 Page 332

dent of the United States. Although the approval of the
Attorney General has not been required previously, as indi-
cated above there have apparently been no instances in
which an American citizen or resident has been the subject
o£ non-consensual electronic surveillance conducted abroad -
by DEA or initiated at its request.

On occasion DEA has also conducted consensual elec-
tronic surveillance outside the United States, usually in- ~
volving the use of a voice transmitter concealed on an
informant, a DEA agent, or a law enforcement officer of the
host country. Under DEA's current policy, this transmitter
device is used with the specific approval and participation
of the foreign country. Again, in almost all cases, the
Surveillance is actually conducted -by a law enforcement
official of the foreign country, rather than by DEA, and
DEA's involvement is in general limited to supplying the
equipment necessary to conduct the surveillance. So far as
DEA can determine, no American citizen or alien resident of
the United States has been the subject of consensual elec-
tronic surveillance conducted abroad through use of this
device by DEA, of by’a foreign country at DEA's request.

I have ordered that whenever practicable DEA shall
obtain the advance approval of the Assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Criminal Division, or Deputy Assistant’ At-
torney General of that Divisiori, before conducting, or re-
questing anyone else to conduct, consensual electronic sur-
veillance outside the United States where the subject of the
surveillance is an American citizen or alien resident of the
United States. Where circumstances preclude a prior request
‘for. authorization, DEA may conduct the surveillance, but
shall notify promptly the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division of the surveillance and the specific
conditions that precluded obtaining prior approval. This
procedure parallels that outlined in Attorney General Klein-
dienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 governing consensual
electronic surveillance within the United States by federal
- @epartments and agencies. It applies, of course, only to

private-conversations, other than telephone conversations,
that are sought to be monitored without the consent of
all the parties to that conversation. For the reasons
mentioned earlier, prior approval for consensual monitor-
ing of telephone conversations is not required.

DEA has also used certain electronic devices abroad
-in order to track the location of drug shipments. These
devices do not transmit, overhear, or record private con-
versations, but rather merely emit signals which indicate
hana location of the device.

DEA's policy concerning electronic surveillance
has aiso been desctibed in ils response to your ictter of --
April 24 to Mr. Bartels. The remaining divisions, bureaus,
and agencies within the Department do not conduct electronic

surveillance of any kind outside the United States.

i trust that the information I have furnished will
_assist your subcommittee in its inquiry concerning the prac-
“tices and procedures of the federal agencies in the area of
electronic surveillance. . :

The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy y i
Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative ce

Practice and Procedure '
Committee on the Judiciary -
Washington, D. C. 20510 © ‘

Dear Senator Kennedy: 7
In my letter to you of May 12, I stated that the De-
partment was in the process of assembling the materials’ rele-
vant to your inquiry regarding electronic surveillance con-
ducted within the United States in the interests of national
security and foreign intelligence. Pursuant to a review of
this matter, I am able to provide you with the following in-
formation.

Since 1940 by directives of the President, the Attorney
General has been vested with responsibility over electronic
surveillance conducted within the United States in the inter-
ests of national security and foreign intelligence. This sur-
veillance is authorized pursuant to the personal approval of
the Attorney General, rather than by court order. Based on

- an examination of the relevant precedents, it is the position
of the Department of Justice that the Executive may conduct
electronic surveillance in the interests of national security
and foreign intelligence, and in aid of his conduct of the
nation's foreign affairs, without obtaining a judicial warrant.

“This has been the position of the Department of Justice for more
than three decades and is supported by historical practice as
‘well as judicial decision. The only two Courts of Appeals to
address the issue, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit, have
held that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does
‘not apply in the area of-national security and foreign intelli-

. gence.and.that under. the.Constitution the President. has the -

. authority to conduct electronic surveillance without a court
order as part of his diplomatic and military or commander-in- :
chief functions. See United States v. Butenko (Appeal of Ivanov),
494 ¥.2d 593 (3rd Cir. 1974) (en bane), cert. denied sub nom.

NW 55322, DocId:32989714 Page 335



Ivanov v. United States 419 U.S. 881 (1974); United States
v. Brown, 484 F.2d 418 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415
U.S. 960 (1974). In Title YII of the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress also explicitly dis-
claimed any attempt to place limitations on the President's
authority in this area. 18 U.S.C. § 2511(3). The Supreme
Court has, of course, expressly left open the question whether
the warrant requirement applies to electronic surveillance con-
ducted for national security and foreign intelligence pur-
poses. In United States v. United States District Court, 407
U.S. 297, 308-9 (1973), however, the Court, while holding that
the domestic security area was subject to the:warrant require-
ment, was careful to note that “the instant case requixes no
judgment with respect to. the activities of foreign powers, with-~
in or without this country. . . There is no evidence of any
involvement, directly or indirectly, of a foreign power." More~
over, in the Butenko case, although the United States prevailed
in the Third Circuit, the Department acquiesced in the petition
for certiorari. Nevertheless, the Court denied certiorari,
thus leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's decision upholding
the authority of the Executive to conduct electronic surveil-

“dance withuut a court oxdex where national security and foreign.
eee is involved.

Under the standards and procedures established by the
President, the personal approval of the Attorney General is re-
quired before’ any non~consensual electronic surveillance may
be instituted within the United States without a judicial war-
rant. All requests for surveillance must be made in writing by
‘tthe Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and must
set forth the relevant factual circumstances that justify the
proposed surveillance. Both the agency and the Presidential
appointee initiating the request must be identified. Requests
from.the Director are examined by a special review group which

. I have established within the Office of the Attorney General.
Authorization will not be granted unless the Attorney General.
has satisfied himself that the requested electronic surveillance
is necessary for national security or foreign intelligence pur-
Poses important to national: security. :

In addition, the Attorney General must bé satisfied tha
the subject of the surveillance is either assisting a re

HW 55322 Docld:32989714 Page 336°


ae fag | a

power or foreign-based political group, or plans unlawful
activity directed against a foreign power or foreign-based
political group. Finally, he must be satisfied that the

. minimum physical intrusion necessary to obtain the informa-
tion will be used.

: !

‘All authorizations are for a period of ninety days or
less, and the specific approval of the Attorney General is
again required for continuation of the surveillance beyond
that period. The Attorney General has also been directed to
review all electronic, surveillance on a regular basis to en-
sure that the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Pursu-
ant to the mandate of United States v. United States District
Court, electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant is
not conducted where there is no foreign involvement.

All electronic surveillance rélated to national security
and foreign intelligence within the United States is conducted
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau has estab-
lished strict internal review procedures with regard to all
electronic surveillance activities.

The extent of telephone and microphone surveillance

conducted within the United States in the interests of nation-

al security and foreign intelligence was last disclosed in 1973.
On a comparable basis, the extent of such surveillance between
1969 arid May 1975 is set forth in the attached memoranda. The
total number of subjects of telephone surveillance during that
period is as follows: 1969, 113; 1970, 90; 1971, 87;-1972, 102;
1973, 116; 1974, 148. These figures do not, of course, indicate
the number of persons whose conversations were intercepted,, but
rather only the number of subjects to whom the surveillance was
directed. The total number of subjects of microphone surveillance
+ during that period was as follows: 1969, 14; 1970, 19; 1971, 16;
1972, 31; 1973, 38; 1974, 32. Again, these figures do not in-
dicate the number of persons whose conversations were inter-
cepted, but rather the number of subjects to whom the sur-
veillance was directed. , Moreover, I should further note that
the above figures are duplicative to an extent since in: several
cases the same subject was under both telephone and microphone

- Surveillance. : : uaseees

: “The total installations of telephone and microphone sur-
veillances during the above periods would, of course, exceed

HW 55322 DocId:32989714 Page 337


these figures by varying margins. On occasion, the sub-
ject under surveillance moved to a new location, thus nec-
essitating a re-*nstallation of the surveillance at the new
address. On other occasions, the surveillance was discon-
tinued because the subject left the premises for an extended
period, but was later re-instituted when the subject returned.
In still other cases, the surveillance was discontinued for a
period as part of the Department's continuing review and re-
“ evaluation of all electronic surveillance activities. The
subsequent re-institution of the surveillance pursuant to a
new approval by the Attorney General would be counted as an
additional installation. For the above reasons, the. number
of installations of telephone and microphone surveillances is
gxeater than the number of subjects of such surveillance, and
would thus not provide an accurate basis’ for evaluating the
extent of electronic surveillance. Nevertheless, pursuant to
your inquiry, I am including in the attached memoranda the total
number of installations of electronic surveillance devices for
both telephone and microphones.

I ‘am.also enclosing the maximum and minimim numher of
telephone and microphone surveillances installed and in opera-
tion for each month between November 1972 and April 1975. These
figures are based on data compiled on a daily basis and reflect
installations and discontinuances of electronic surveillance de-~
vices. The records of daily counts were initiated in November

1972. Comparable information is not available for prior periods.

As these figures indicate, the maximum number of telephone sur-
veillances in operation at any time during 1973 was 93; the
minimum number in operation that year was 65. The maximum
number of microphone surveillances in operation during 1973

was 22; the minimum was 10. In 1974, the maximum number of
telephone surveillances in operation was 106; the minimum num-
ber in operation was 75. Microphone surveillances in operation
‘during that period ranged from a maximum of 21 to a minimum of
10. During the first four and a half months of 1975, the maxi-
mum number of telephone .surveillances in operation at any time
was 91; the minimum was 67. The. maximum number of microphone
surveillances in operation at any time during that period was
20; the minimum was 9. On April 1, 1975, there were 75 tele-
phone and 15 microphone surveillances in operation.

I trust that the information supplied to date is of
assistance to your subcommittee in its inquixy-into the prac-
