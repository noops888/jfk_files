BETTE

Sales Manager, Doheny Plaza Apartments, where

ROSSELLI has made a reservation to buy an apartment, stated that

no further committment has been made by roSSELLI and the

"Reservation" is a very loose arrangement, binding neither

on ROSSELLI nor the apartment owners.

The manager stated that.

inasmuch as ROSSELLI has put no money down he does not

believe ROSSELLI is really serious about purchasing an

apartment.
