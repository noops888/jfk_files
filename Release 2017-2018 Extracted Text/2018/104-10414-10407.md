Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the purpose of Project Renewal)

CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities," SCANTLING has continued (see pre-
vious Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA~17999, 31
October 1961, HMMA-14093, 13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18
November 1960) to provide worthwhile information pertaining to this ob-
jective, _During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be used ex~
tensively to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT and LIENVOY, An ex-
cellent example of this blending of variot tation support assets was the
investigation and casing performed by SCANTLING after leads from both
LIENVOY and LIFEAT indicated the possibility of launching a successful
technical operation against the residence of a high ranking LIMERICK .
intelligence officer assigned to Mexico under diplomatic cover, With the
aid of the thorough casing report and neighborhood investigation completed
by SCANTLING, Station KURIOT personnel, supported by other Station
support assets, were successful in installing a technical device in nthe
target.

SCANTLING continues to be the Station's primary means of keeping
current records on the residences of the many Soviet personnel in Mexico
City, This is primartly accomplished through SCANTLING's follow up of
all LIENVOY leads which indicate interest by Soviets in specific quarters. _
(See previous project renewal requests for additional details.)

2, “To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence in-
terest operating‘ in Mexico". SCANTLING is very useful for collecting in-
formation on. other Station targets: ..°)

. a, On the basis of a lead from the ODACID installation in
Veracruz, the Station (with Headquarters support) mounted an
operation to unobtrusively sabotage a large unit of agricultural
machinery (of U.S. origin) which was in transit to Cuba, To
mount this operation, a precise and detailed casing of the imple-
‘ment was essential, This SCANTLING was ba Ve Deas ish in
one trip to Veracruz with results that contributed subp

the operation. anaes ere

b,. SCANTLING provided the Station a detailed investigation 2
of Harotun ("Harry") KOPOIAN, employee of American Communists
Albert and Margaret MALTZ, which determined the residence
of KOPOIAN as well as his family status and comnections,

c, In the Satellite area; SCANTLING completed a casing of
an official Yugoslav installation in Conjunction witha Projected
Station technical operation, ‘

3. “To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

* and ssurveillances," SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both.

directly and indirectly as noted in the following examples:

a, SCANTLING. completed a detailed and secure interview of
the fiancee Of (SESMOOTH to determine her connection with the
principals in the; MCMAYFOWL case, particularly any connection
-with procurement of documents used in the flight behind the Iron
Curtain. This assignment was extremely sensitive (SCANTLING
was not told true reason for interview) and SCANTLING did an
admirable job while maintaining his cover for having the interview.

b,_SCANTLING was called on for extensive initial spade work
in the(BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation, SCANTLING =» gave his
usual competent performance despite the fact that the role assigned
him was unique to his experience,

c, SCANTLING performed one man surveillance of a sensitive
Station Soviet double:agent which:contributed significaprly to that
operation,

d, SCANTLING was used extensively during the visit of
GPIDEAL as part of the Station's effort in providing maximum
protection for the GPIDEAL party.

oe «An addition,-SCANTLING performed numerous pretext and
nnelghborhood investigations, some of which were highly sensitive.
SCANTLING also does most.of the local investigations requested by
ODACID and other ODYOKE components.

4. In addition to.his contributions to the above objectives, SCANTLING
is used for miscellaneous support requirements from the Station, For example,
SCANTLING handled LIEMBROIL-2 until -the return of LIMOTOR-14 in July
1962, SCANTLING is also used to spot and rent safe house
for other Station operations. SECRET

“B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

“personnel and physical facilities through use of photographic basé houses,"

rent hotel rooms and apart-ments, and conduct counter-surveillances,"

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be com-
pletely fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made
important and valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives
specifically and to other Station activities In general, SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures, case officer time
and other intengible factors, unquestionably justifies his continuation
as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY. a ||

objectives):
1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK

Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective, To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute

to the above objective. This was described in detail in the 1960 Request for
Project Renewal, (HMMA-15979)

2, “To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is still the major contributor to this objective,
Among LIENTRAP's regular and extensive photographic assignments, was
the photo stakeout of prominent Mexican Communists (some of whom have
never been photographed previously by KUBARK) and Communist Party
Headquarters. During this assignment, LIENTRAP was able to cover
the recent move of PCM Headquatters (the first information Station had
of the move) and to continue photo surveillance at the new site,

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, t.e.,

GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities,'--GERENDE's Comprehensive area ~"==*"
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Sation asset for such support activities, GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them, .

4, The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE s control
and supervision is considered worthwhile and in some cases unique, The
Station concludes, therefore, that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project
should be continued,

C. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives: -

As stated in previous project renewals, it can readily be noted that
. Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and in
this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance of the Related
Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive intelligence
nor has it been intended that it should do so, The project's sole purpose
_is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational information
in support of other Station operations.

CHANGES

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the
past project year affecting either objectives or personnel,

EFFECTIVENESS

‘There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter
the validity of the remarks made in Section IM of 1960 project renewal re-

quest (HMMA 15979)
PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation,
which was described in 1960 renewal request, ts still present but has
caused no known difficulty. At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the
LICALLA base was reactivated on 29 May 1961. The base operator.con-
tinues to be alert for any unusual Incidents which might indicate that the

~-base has been compromised, ~~

“PLANS | . ce

‘The Station considers that the project is operating at.its optimum
size and does not plan to expand it during the coming year, Efforts will
be continued to refine and better utilize the existing project organizational
-arrangements, As in the past, the Station will continue its efforts to
improve the compartmentation and pas ty of the project, . .
