TO

Chief, SRS

Thru : DC/SRS and C/FIOB/SRS

SUBJECT: CAIN, Richard S.

#272 141

DATE: 9 October 1967

Jo Reference is made to the attached 5 June 1967

memo

randure on Subject, which in turn made reference to previous

memoranda on him on 24 and 25 May 1967 and to an Office of Security

memorandur dated 29 May 1967. The 5 June 1967 memorandum

enclosed copies of several 1963/1964 documents from the Chicago

Field Office's file on CAIN, which.

I forwarded to SRS with

the comment that "It appears

Haryey OSWALD, et al."

Subject, it is obvious, had been a source of information

regarding an alleged discussion of the assassination of President

Kennedy at a secret meeting of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

held in Chicago in February 1963 under the direction of Richard

CRILEY (4346 116). He also was the source of information regarding

the alleged attempted recruitment into the Communist Party of young

Cubans in the Chicago area by one Guillermo ESCOBAR, who accorde

ing to the Chicago office was "one ofl

(SAS) leads

obtained from Ralph PEREZ." (Presumably Ralph PEREZ, #444260)

SPEED is

$ #199499. The documents also indicated

that in February 1964 CAIN was the subject of a conversation initiated

by Eldon S. COHEN, 38557 o/c, with a representative of the - /

Chicago office who believed his purpose was to learn whether or not

CAIN was in fact on a two-month's sick leave from the COOK County

Sheriff's office, as he was said to be, or was on a political under

cover assignment which CCHEN inferred involved tapping the tele-

phones of gubernatorial candidate Charles H.. PERCY and other

political figures.

3.. During review of GAIN's Security file, I noted & message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned

a "Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"

who obviously had had contact of some kind with GAIN; as well as with

a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. II (Acopy of this memo

randum is attached). In answer to this message which reguested traces

on GAIN, Headguarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS, nor a claima

he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substantiated. The

Station was advised that he did have (ox had had) a legitimate detective.

laboratory in Chicago.

.:5. The firsttime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office

Tras when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their reguest

stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which

he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in

Chicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico

was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police

methods, in investigative techaiques, and in the use of the lie detector;

and had added that he was investigating. Communism in a certain unnamed

Central American country.

6. In June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being

deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:

Carrying a loaded revolver and brass knuckles

b.

Impersonating a Mexican Government official

(He had identification as an investigato, for the

Mexican Treasury Office.)

Violating his tourist permit by sorking at his

detective office and at the Mexican Treasury
