3., During review of GAIN's Security file, I noted zmessage
regarding him from Mexico City, on 25, April 1962, which mentioned
a" Willard d ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico," -

who obviously had had contact of some kind with CAIN;- as well as with

a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that

CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. IL (Acopy of this memo=-

randum is attached). In answer to this message which requested traces

on CAIN, Headquarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard.

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS,-mor aclaim| -
“{ he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substantiated. ‘The | -
| Station was advised that he did have (ox had had) a Tegitirhate Sodeeatas x 7

laboratory in Cuicege. ; :

5. The Birsttime ‘CAIN came to the attention of the Security Office. -:f-.
‘was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their request :
stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which

he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches in
_Ghicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico
was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police
methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector; :
and had added that he was investigating Communism in a certain unnzamed +
_Gentral American country. en ; Suet :
