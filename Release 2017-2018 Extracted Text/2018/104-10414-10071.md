"ACTION REGUIRED - REFERENCES

Reference: RMMA 26006, 30 April 1965

1. During the second, quarter of 1965 (the period covered by this
report) the LIONION operation experienced some technical difficulties which
have not been solved to date. Normal coverage of the target was obtained
throughout the month of April with the exposure of some 600 feet of film by
the pulse canera and 28 rolls of 36-exposure Tri-X by the Pentax/Balscope
installation, Normal coverage continued until 27 May at which time the pulse
cainera became inoperative owing to a burned-out drive motor, The camera wa3
removed and forwarded to Headquarters for necessary repairs and a Pentax with
a 180 mm telephoto lens was rigged as a temporary substitute for coverage of
the Consulate entrance. On 16 June a reconditioned pulse camera was received
and immediately placed in service. Unfortunately, this unit failed on 27 June
and was removed. A faulty shutter motor was to blame. This camera was also
forwarded to Headquarters for repair and the Pentax/180 mm rig was again set
up. This rig is being operated by LIONION-2.
