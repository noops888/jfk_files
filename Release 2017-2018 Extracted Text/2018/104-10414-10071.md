PBRUMEN/LIONION/Operational Progress Report

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

MICROFILM

Reference: AMMA 26006, 30 April 1965

During the second quarter of 1965 (the perlod covered by this

report) the LIONION operation experienced some technical difficulties which

have not been solved to date. Normal coverage of the target was obtained

throughout the month of April with the exposure of some 600

feet of film by

the pulse camera and 28 rolls of 36-exposure TriX by the Pentax/Balscope

Normal coverage continued until 27 May at which time the pulse

camera became inoperative owing to a burned-out drive motor.

The camera was

removed and forwarded to Headquarters for necessary repairs and a Pentax wich

a 180 mm telephoto lens was rigged as a temporary substitute for coverage of

the Consulate entrance. On. 16 June a reconditioned pulse camera was received

and immediately placed in service. Unfortunately, this unit failed on 27 June

and was. removed.

A faulty shutter motor was to blame. This camera was also

forwarded to Headquarters

for repair and the Pentax/180 mm rig was again set

This rig is being operated by LIONION=2.

2. Morale of both agents continues high, expecially in view of the

excellent service Headquarters performed In

for these agents. (Both were astounded
