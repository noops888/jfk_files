A. McCone, who was then Director of Central Intelligence,
indicated that Oswald "was not an agent, employee, or

solicited any reports or information from him, or communicated

with him directly or in any other manner...Oswald was never

further efforts by the Warren Commission to investigate
this matter.

The Committee sought to resolve the issue of Oswald's
alleged association with the CIA by conducting an inquiry
that went beyond the threshold level of obtaining statements
from two of the Agency's most senior officials. Instead,

a more analytical investigative approach was utilized.
First, an effort was made to identify circumstances either
in Oswald's life or in the manner in which his case was
handled by the CIA which were potentially suggestive of an
intelligence association of -some kind. Then, an intensive
file review was undertaken which included both the CIA's
144-volume Oswald file and hundreds of others from the CIA,
as well as the FBI, State Department, and the Department of

Defense. ef Based upon these file reviews, a series of

interviews, depositions, and executive session hearings were
conducted with both Agency and non-Agency witnesses. The
contacts with present and former CIA personnel covered a
broad range of individuals, including staff and division
chiefs, clandestine case officers, area desk officers,
research analysts, secretaries, and clerical assistants.
In total, more than 125 persons, including at least 50
present and former CIA employees, were questioned
regarding this issue.

The results of this investigation confirmed the
Warren Commission testimony given by Messrs. McCone and
Helms. ‘There was no indication in Oswald's CIA file
suggestive in any way that he had ever had any contact with
the Agency. Moreover, the Agency emptoyees who would have

been in a position to know if Oswald had been associated

Finally, taken in their entirety, the items of circumstantial
evidence that the Committee had selected for investigation
as possibly indicative of an intelligence association did
not support the allegation that Oswald had an intelligence
agency relationship of any kind.

This finding, however, must be qualified because the
same institutional characteristics, in terms of the Agency's
extreme compartmentalization and the complexity of its
enormous filing system, that are designed to preclude
penetration by foreign powers have the simultaneous effect
of making Congressional inquiry very difficult For example,
CIA personnel testified to the Committee that a review of

since every American legal traveler who was involved in this
program was recruited before Oswald's trip to the Soviet Union,
the relevant year for Lee Harvey Oswald was 1959 because that
is when he departed from the United States.

**One officer acknowledges the remote possibility that an
individual could have been run by someone as part of a “vest
pocket" operation without other Agency officials knowing
about it, but even this possibility, as it applies to Oswald,
was negated by the statement of the deputy chief of the Soviet
Russia clandestine activities section who commented that in 1963
he was involved in a review of every clandestine operation ever
run in the Soviet Union, and that OsWald was not involved
in any of these cases.

which utilized Americans traveling in the Soviet Union

as a means of obtaining information and identifying
possible subjects for recruitment, informed the Committee

that they met with each person involved in this activity

and that Oswald was not one of them. These Agency officials

also advised the Committee that only “clean-cut" college
graduates were used in this program, and that Oswald did
not meet this criteria. Finally, the Agency officers in
charge of the Soviet Russia division's research section
in support of clandestine activities indicated that, had
Oswald been contacted by the Agency, their section would
probably have been informed, but that this, in fact, never

occurred.

The CIA has long acknowledged that, prior to the
President's assassination, it had a personality file on
Lee Harvey Oswald? This file, which in Agency terminology
is referred to as a 201 file, was opened on December 9, 1960.

opened when a person is considered to be of potential

individual into one centralized records system belonging
to the Deputy Directorate for Operations, that component
of the Agency responsible for clandestine activities.

The existence of a 201 file does not necessarily
connote any actual relationship or contact with the CIA.
For example, the Oswald file was purportedly opened
because he was considered to be a potential counterintelligence
threat. Oswald's file contained absolutely no indication that
he had ever had any relationship with the CIA. Nevertheless,
because the Committee was aware of at least one instance
{in an unrelated case) where an Agency officer had apparently
contemplated the use of faked files with forged documents, cv

special attention was given to procedural questions that were

occasioned by this file review.

during that same time period. Of 29 files that were reviewed,
eight individuals had been the subject of 201 files prior to
the time of their defection. In only four of the remaining
twenty-one cases were 201 files opened at the time of
defection. The files on the 17 other defectors were opened

At the very least, this file review indicated that

was not at all uncommon. In many cases the opening was
triggered by some event, independent of the defection, which

specifically to explain how this mistake _ made, All

Agency personnel, however, including the person who initiated
the file opening, testified that this must have been occasioned

explain its meaning.

The Agency's response indicated that "AG" is the OI
("Other Identification") code meaning “actual or potential
defectors to the East or the SINO/SOVIET Bloc including
Cuba," and that anyone so described could have the OI
code "AG." This code was reportedly added to Oswald's

opening form because of the comment on the form that he had

defected to the Soviet Union in 1959.

An Agency official who was a DDO records expert and
for many years had been involved in the CIA's investigative
efforts concerning the John F. Kennedy assassination, gave

He explained that these codes always utilized two letters and
that in this case, the first letter "A" must have reprecented
Communism, while the second letter would represent some
category within the Communist structure.

His recollection was that at the time of the
assassination the "AG" code was not yet in existence because
there were no provisions then in effect within the Agency for
the indexing of American defectors. He recalled that it was
only during the life of the Warren Commission that the CIA
realized that its records system lacked provisions for
indexing an individual such as Oswald. Consequently, the
CIA then revised its — handbook to include authorization
for indexing American defectors and established a code for

its computer system to be used for the category of “American

defectors." Although this individual did not know when the

notation "AG" was added to Oswald's opening sheet, he presumed

that it would have to have been following the addition of

the American defector code, thus placing the time somewhere

in the middle of the Warren Commission's investigation. He

explained that it was difficult to determine when any of the

notations on the opening sheet were made, since it was standard

procedure to update the forms whenever necessary so that they

were as reflective as possible of the available information.

The form that was used to initiate the opening of Lee
Harvey Oswald's 201 file contains a notation indicating that
the file was to be “restricted." This indication was
considered potentially significant because of the CIA's

practice of restricting agents' files to persons on a “need

The individual who nee placed the restriction on

her to remain aware of any developments that might have

occurred with regard to the file. This purpose was achieved

because any Peeing Secioneaii to the file first had to

officer could be apprised of any developments possibly
necessitating access to the file by someone else.

This testimony was confirmed by a CIA records expert
who further testified that, had the file been permanently
cha ged as well as restricted, the possibility of a relationship
with the CIA would have been greater. There was no indication
on Oswald's form that it had been placed on permanent cha ge.

Finally, the Committee reviewed the files of four other
defectors which had been opened at the same time and by the
same person as Oswald's, and determined that each of their
files had similarly been restricted. Each of these other

20 February 1964, which stated that 37 documents were missing
from Oswald's 201 file. According to the memorandum, this
statement was based upon a comparison of a machine listing
of documents officially recorded as being in the 201 file and
those documents actually physically available in the file.
While the memorandum that such a machine listing was
attached, no such attachment was found in the 201 file at

the time of the Committee's review. . The memorandum itself

In response to a Committee inquiry, the CIA advised
that because Oswald's file was so active during the course of
the Warren Commission investigation, up-to-date machine listings
were produced periodically. On this basis, the Agency stated
: that “it must be assumed that whoever was responsible for
locating the 37 documents and placing them in the file."

the Agency relied upon the FBI both to make such contacts and

To investigate this question further, the Committee
reviewed the files of 22 individuals (selected from an original
list of 380 possible Soviet defectors) who were born in America

1958 and 1963.* Of these 22 individuals, only four were
interviewed at any time by the CIA. These four instances
tended to involve particular intelligence or counterintelligence
needs, but this was not always the case.

to the Soviet Union. _/ In a subsequent response, the
Department acknowledged the existence of some evidence that
Oswald had offered information to the Soviet Union, but
stated that there were, nevertheless, serious obstacles to a

It (Department file) does contain a copy of

Texas, at which time he denied furnishing
any information to the Soviets concerning
his Marine Corps experiences. He stated
: that he never gave the Soviets any information

which would be used to the detriment of the
United States. “

In the prosecution of a criminal case, the

According to Ms. McMillan's testimony about the events
surrounding her interview with Lee Harvey Oswald, in November
1959 she had just returned from a visit to the United States
where she covered the Camp David summit between President
Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev. On November 16, 1959, she
went to the American embassy to pick up her mail for the first
time since her return to the Soviet Union. The mail pickup
facility was in a foyer near the consular office. Consular
Officer John A. McVickar came out of this office and welcomed
McMillan back to the Soviet Union. They exchanged a few
words, and as she was leaving, McVickar commented that at
her hotel was an American who was trying to defect to the
Soviet Union. McVickar stated that the American would not
speak to "any of us," but might speak to McMillan because she
was a woman. She recalls that as she was leaving, McVickar

McMillan proceeded to her hotel, found out the
American's room number, knocked on his door, and asked him
for an interview. The American, Lee Harvey Oswald, did not
ask her into the room, but he did agree to talk to her in her

room later that night. No American government official

arranged the actual interview with Oswald. She met with Oswald

the day after her interview with Oswald, and asked her to supper.

McVickar indicated a general concern about Oswald and felt that

Ms. Millan also testified that she had never worked for
the CIA, nor was she connected with any other federal government
agency at the time of her interview with Lee Harvey Oswald.
According to an affidavit that Ms. McMillan filed with the

Committee, her only employment with the federal government was

the CIA in 1952 as an intelligence analyst. The application
was withdrawn, but the CIA completed its security check on
her and denied her a security clearance. She acknowledged
being debriefed by an Agency employee in 1962 after returning

from her thrid trip to the Soviet Union, but explained that this

to Ms. McMillan corroborated her testimony. There was no

indication in the file suggesting that she had ever worked for

*In November 1962, I had a conversation with a man who
identified himself as a C.I.A. employee and gave his name as
either Donald Jameson or James MacDonald. I agreed to see him
in part because the confiscation of my papers and notes had
utterly altered my situation -- I now had no hope of returning
to the U.S.S.R. and was free for the first time to write what
I knew. I was preparing a series of articles for The Reporter
which would contain thé same information about which Mr.
Jameson had expressed a desire to talk to me. Finally, during
the latter part of my 1962 trip to the U.S.S.R., I had been
under heavy surveillance and the K.G.B. knew what Soviet citi-
zens I had seen. Many of those I had talked to for the Reporter
articles were Russian "liberals" (anti-Stalin and pro-Khrushchev) ||
What reprisals might befall those whom I had interviewed I
did not know, but since my notes were now part of the K.G.B.
files, I felt that it might help them if the C.I.A. knew that
which the K.G.B. already knew. My meeting with Mr. Jameson,
which occurred at the Brattle Inn, Cambridge, was a reversal of
my usual effort to avoid contact with the C.I.A., and the
subject matter was confined to my impressions of the Soviet
literary and cultural climate.

Davison admitted his involvement in the Penkovsky spy
case. Specifically, he stated that in connection with his
assignment as U.S. Embassy physician in Moscow, he had received
some superficial intelligence training. This training mainly
involved lectures on Soviet life and instructions on remembering
and reporting Soviet names and military activities. During his
tour of duty in Moscow, Davison was asked by an Embassy
employee, whose name he no longer remembers, to observe a
certain lamp post on his daily route between his apartment
and the Embassy ange be alert for a signal by telephone;

one who moved easily in the social and professional circles

of oilmen and the so-called "White Russian" community, many

shunned by the very same Dallas Russian community which

got biographical data on deMohrenschildt after a trip to
Yugoslavia for the International Cooperation Administration.
Moore says also in that 1964 memorandum that he had seen
deMohrenschildt several times in 1958 and 1959. DeMohrenschildt's
CIA file contains several reports submitted by deMohrenschildt
to the CIA on topics concerning Yugoslavia, including “Lack
of Interest in Communist Ideology," “National Pride/Feeling
of Superiority over Soviet Satellites," and "Effect of
Decentralization in the Oil. Industry."

regard, it should be stressed that, upon returning from trips

basis. Such acts of cooperation eiuhia not be confused with
an actual Agency relationship.*

Department of Defense officials and that deMohrenschildt's
presence (in the company of his wife) was unanticipated. The
Committee does not regard this incident as evidence of any
Agency relationship because there is no indication that any
United States governmental official actually solicited
deMohrenschildt's assistance with regard to this meeting.

American countries. This happened to coincide with Oswald's
visit to Mexico City between September 27, 1963 and
October , 1963. After the assassination, Gaudet advised
the FBI during an interview that he had once been employed
by the CIA. Speculation about Gaudet's possible relationship
with Lee Harvey Oswald was created when it was discovered that
the Warren Commission Report contained a list, provided by
the Mexican Government and purporting to include all individuals
who had been issued Mexican tourist cards at the same time as
Oswald, which nevertheless omitted Gaudet's name. ey

At a Committee deposition, Gaudet testified that his

contact with the CIA was primarily as a source of information
reflecting information that he had obtained during his trips
abroad; in addition, Gaudet maintained that he occasionally per-
formed errands for Agency personnel. Gaudet stated that his

had never been formally terminated.

The Committee reviewed Gaudet's CIA file, but found
neither any record reflecting a contact between him and the
Agency after 1961 nor any indication that he had “performed
errands“ for the CIA.* A memorandum, dated January 23, 1976,
seemed to confirm the absence of any further contact after

this time:

The Domestic Collections Divison (DCD) has an inactive
file on William George Gaudet, former editor and
publisher of The Latin American Report. The file shows
that Gaudet was a source of the New Orleans DCD
Resident Office from 1948 to 1955 during which period
he provided foreign intelligence information on Latin
American political and economic conditions resulting
from his extensive travel in South and Central America
in pursuit of journalistic interests. The file further
indicates that Gaudet was a casual contact of the New
Orleans Office between 1955 and 1961 when, at various
times, he furnished fragmentary intelligence and tried
unsuccessfully to obtain financial loans from the Agency,

Oswald's trip have been raised by his ability to obtain a

The Committee was unable to determine the circumstances
surrounding Oswald's trip from London to Helsinki. Louis
Hopkins, the travel agent who arranged Oswald's initial
transportation from the United States, stated that he did not
know Oswald's ultimate destination at the time that Oswald
booked his passage on the freighter Marion Lykes; consequently,

Hopkins had nothing to do with the London to Helsinki leg of

another ship that would have docked at a port more convenient

of concern to the Warren Commission. aA In a letter to

the CIA dated May 25, 1964, J. Lee Rankin inquired about the
apparent speed with which Oswald's Soviet visa was issued.
Rankin noted that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes
of the State Department who contended that at the time
Oswald received his visa to enter Russia from the Soviet

Embassy in Helsinki, at least one week ordinarily passed

the issuance of the visa. Rankin contended that if Chayes'

assessment was accurate, then Oswald's ability to obtain

his tourist visa in two days might have been very significant.
The CIA responded to Rankin's request for information

on July 31, 1964. Richard Helms wrote to Rankin that the Soviet

Consulate in Helsinki was able to issue a transit visa (valid

for 24 hours) to U.S. businessmen within five minutes, but

Rankin, dated September 14, 1964, added that during the 1964
tourist season, Soviet Consulates in at least some Western
European cities issued Soviet tourist visas in from five to
seven days.

In an effort to resolve this issue, the Committee has

reviewed the CIA file on Gregory Golub, who was the Soviet
Consul in Helsinki when Oswald was issued his tourist visa.
Golub's file reveals that, in addition to his Consular
activities, he was suspected to have been an officer
\ of the Soviet KGB.

charges that Oswald's early discharge from the Marine Corps

security clearance nor a substantial period of service in

Taiwan. These allegations were considered relevant to the

issue of Oswald's possible association with the CIA.

Oswald's Marine Corps records bore no indication that

he had ever received any intelligence training or performed
on any intelligence assignments during his term of service.
As a Marine sering in Atsugi, Japan, Oswald had a security
clearance of confidential and never received a higher classifi-
cation. Based upon the Warren Commission testimony of John
E. Donavan, the officer who had been in charge of Oswald's
crew, that all personnel working in the radar center were
required to have a minimum security clearance of secret, the
allegation has been made that the security clearance of

Oswald's military records also dispelled the allegation
that he had served for a substantial period in Taiwan. These
records state that Oswald served in Japan from September 12,

1957 until November 2, 1958. Department of Defense records,

however, do indicate that MAG (Mariné Air Group) 11, Oswald's unit,

was deployed for Taiwan on September 16, 1958 and remained in
that area until April 1959, but an examination of the MAG 11
unit diaries indicated that Oswald had remained in Japan as
part of a rear echelon. Oswald's records also state that on
October 6, 1958 he was transferred within MAG 11 toa

Japan. The next week he reportedly spent in the Atsugi

Station Hospital. On November 2, 1958, Oswald left Japan
for duty in the United States.

Accordingly, there is no indication in Oswald's
military records that he had spent any time in Taiwan. This
finding is contrary to that of the Warren Commission that
Oswald arrived with his unit in Taiwan on September 30, 1958, _/
but the Commission's analysis apparently was made without access
to the unit diaries of MAG 11.*

Finally, with one exception, the circumstances surrounding
Oswald's rapid discharge from the military do not appear to have
been unusual. Oswald was obligated to service on active duty
until December 7, 1959, but he applied for a hardship discharge

on August 17, 1958 and two weeks later the application

application was processed so expeditiously because it was
accompanied with all of the necessary documentation.

In response to a Committee inquiry, the Department
of Defense has stated that "to a large extent, the time

member had prepared the documentation needed for consideration

that his initial application was accompanied by all of the

*By September 4, 1959, Oswald had been informed that he would be
discharged on September 11, 1959. This explains why he was
able to tell passport officials on that day that he expected
to depart the United States on September 21, 1959.

interviewed Marguerite Oswald, and concluded that she “could
not be considered employable from an emotional standpoint." fey

quarters at Fort Sam Houston, he heard about the assassination

file, he telephoned the local FBI office in San Antonio to
notify the FBI that he had some information. He soon was in

information obtained from reports filed by the eight to
twelve Military Intelligence agents who performed liaison
functions with the Secret Service in Dallas on the day of the
assassination. This “after action" report was then maintained
in the Oswald file. Jones did not contact, nor was he

The Committee found Jones' testimony to be very credible.
His statements concerning the contents of the Oswald file
are consistent with FBI communications that were generated as
a result of the information which he initially provided.
Access to Oswald's Military Intelligence file, which the
Department of Defense never gave to the Warren Commission, was
not possible because the Department of Defense had destroyed
the file as part of a general program aimed at eliminating all
of its files pertaining to nonmilitary personnel. In
response to a Committee inquiry, the Department of Defense

gave the following explanation for the file's destruction:

1. Dossier AB 652876, OSWALD, Lee Harvey, was
identified for deletion from IRR (Intelligence
Records and Reports) holdings on Julian date
73060 (1 March 1973) as stamped on the micro-
filmed dossier cover. It is not possible to
determine the actual date when~physical
destruction was accomplished, but is credibly
surmised that the destruction was accomplished
within a period not greater than sixty days
following the identification for deletion.

Evidence such as the type of deletion record
available, the individual clerk involved in

the identification, and the projects in progress
at the time of deletion, all indicate the dossier
deletion resulted from the implementation of a
Department of the Army, Adjutant General letter
dated 1 June 1971, subject: Acquisition of
Information Concerning Persons and Organizations
not Affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD)
(Incl 1). Basically, the letter called for the
elimination of files on non~DOD affiliated
persons and organizations.

2. It is not possible to determine who accomplished
the actual physical destruction of the dossier.

The individual identifying the dossier for deletion
can be determined from the clerk number appearing
on the available deletion record. The number
indicates that Lyndall E. Harp was the identifying
clerk. Harp was an employee of the IRR from 1969
until late 1973, at which time she transferred

to the Defense Investigative Service, Fort Holabird,
Maryland, where she is still a civil service
employee. The individual ordering the destruction
or deletion cannot be determined. However, available
evidence indicates that the dossier was identified
for deletion under a set of criteria applied by

IRR clerks to all files. The basis for these
criteria were established in the 1 June 1971 letter.
There is no indication that the dossier was specifically
identified for review or deletion. All evidence
shows that the file was reviewed as part of a
generally applied program to eliminate any dossier
concerning persons not affiliated with DOD.

3. The exact material contained in the dossier
cannot be determined at this time. However,
discussions with all available persons who recall
seeing the dossier reveal that--it most probably
included: newspaper clippings relating to pro-
Cuban activities of Oswald, several Federal
Bureau of Investigation reports, and possibly
some Army counterintelligence reports. None of

significant information in the dossier. It should
be noted here that the Army was not asked to
investigate the assassination. Consequently, any
Army derived information was turned over to the
appropriate civil authority.

4. At the time of the destruction of the Oswald
dossier, IRR was operating under the records
disposal authority contained in the DOD Memorandum
to Secretaries of the Military Departments, OASD(A),
9 February 1972, subject: Records Disposal
Authority (Incl 2). The memorandum forwards
National Archivist disposal criteria which is
similar in nature to the requirements outlined

in the 1 June 1971 instructions. It was not

until 1975 that the Archivist changed the criteria
to ensure non-destruction of investigative records
that may be of historical value. /
