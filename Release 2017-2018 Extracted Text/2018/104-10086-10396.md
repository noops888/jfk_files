1. On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited the Warrenton} Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
"unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed

i Mexico’ Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

vetwriazatonnee; REPRODUCTION PROMIBITED

“s\~ From the time the Mexico Station was opened| in April 1947

until

it s < . re
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station {in_1955) the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City.. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a

mail intercept operation.

* Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by{an e

rg {telephone company who was] handled by a Station case officer. The number

of lines tapped was limited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
- American recruited agents.
‘Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer’
: assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

ir a language other than Spanish or English were taken to pes location
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions! but because of the volume of Russian conversatfons, the translations
asuatly ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.
| AS Soon as the Station leaned that an Anerican identifying him-
|. self as-Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy,- Hiss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening all photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.
Tihe instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, -and cars with
{foreign license plates. tuman error did occur but generally the agents

There was some delay because Statfon personnel waited to compare the

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Chancery 15-61-55.
‘Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay .
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer ‘had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa_here (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington. Yet g ly this man
(the American) , “+ showed him a he (the
favor of Cuba

American) is a member of an

DURAN: KS , because the problem with him (the American)
is thf he does:

n't Know anyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very difficult to give him a visa, because he was
thinking of processing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take a long time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

* OW ii ton (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this, she can communicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they, do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because do not know if the visa will be approved.

They can-only give ‘the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don’t know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It.was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Enbassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

» Item 395, pages 7 and 8

‘At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Enbassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably @ pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he isin the Russian Enbassy and they need to
Imow what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in‘@dessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the pass: ger. 1 fest...

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the .
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she’ sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that ‘lie doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her,name and
someone will-retum the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet ‘thanks her. COLTS
