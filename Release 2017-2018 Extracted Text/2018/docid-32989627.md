Interview of Donald E. Moore by
Mr. Loch Johnson, Senate Select Committee
July 28, 1975

Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal
interview and he did not place me under oath, He asked about my
background which was provided him and included the fact that I

served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at
the end of June 1973.

The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee
and he asked if I knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee
was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill
Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before
the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson
was informed as follows:

Iwas aware of the meeting at the White House attended by
Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Bennett.
Iwas probably aware the meeting was to take place before the
meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was
held June 5, 1970.) Iwas not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's
office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably
from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic
Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar,
George Moore, Fred Cassidy arid I were present. I did attend the
initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was
present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan
and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI
representatives were present, He mentioned George Moore and
Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.

I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from,CIA were present
but did not recall the names of others including the representatives
from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired
the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table.
Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't
stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although
he did not sit directly at the conference table.

ENCLOSURE, “ba- Wa Z9s~- S93

d


HW 55116 DocId:32989627 Page 18 : HH 7

\

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that
Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of
getting better intelligence information on new left activities and
violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to
possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas
of concern and asked representatives present to document where they
felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should
obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this
date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed
the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and
ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific
recommendations at a subsequent meeting. Iam certain Mr. Huston
spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments,

This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended.
I told Mr. Suilivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend
subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives
present and that the thrust was on new left and related activities. As
I recall he said "suit yourself.'' Johnson pressed me on this andI
told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat
uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was
aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I
could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but
I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill
Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.

I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under
Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach
had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director
and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. I
don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the
recommendations were added.. I can't say whether I'saw the report
prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing
the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether
Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume
Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this
basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson
was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt
he would have objected to the initial recommendations.



ee ®

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report
had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated
the President had approved the recommendations. I was aware
Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell
expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was
withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this
occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.

Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or
after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage
was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-
ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,
Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my
pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the
Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department
of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this

‘aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what

was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious
entry of embassies io obiain crypiographic materials.

Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had
been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover
to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection, I
answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not
make a definite statement yes or no.

’

He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to
the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I
did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the
Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and
met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better
arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.

He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,
Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to
NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was
aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.
I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for
support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally
and perhaps had written him.

Mr. Callahan requested that a research be conducted to
determine whether the FBI or the Department of Justice would be
authorized to pay for private counsel for employees called to testify
before the Senate Select Committee and who desired private counsel.

I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the
Department is that we could not provide counsdidirectly to the individuals
because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the
individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my
knowledge the question concerning whether the Government ceuld pay for
private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched.

Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted.

RECOMMENDATION: nce

That the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel confer
and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahan’ request.

egal Counsel memorandum to you dated 7-8-75
captioned Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

and Legal Counsel Division confer and prepare an appropriate
response to Mr. Callahan's request that research be con-
ducted to determine whether the FBI or the Department of

employees who are called to testify before the Senate
Select Committee and who desire private counsel. We have
also undertaken to present the statutory considerations
governing the provision of such representation in a legal
proceeding as distinguished from a legislative hearing. ate

Title 5, United States Code, Section 3106, states:

This statutory prohibition makes it clear that
only the Attorney General has the authority to make a
contract for special employment of an attorney. This
Bureau, as an agency of the Department of Justice, ob-
‘viously does not have authority to do that which is
denied to Executive departments which are otherwise of

coequal stature to the Department of Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
| Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

An examination of our budgetary language by
representatives of the Administrative Division and this
Division does not disclose any explicit or implicit
authority which would qualify as "otherwise authorized by
law, . . ." under the above statute. The statutory
authority for provision of private counsel is contained in
Title28, United States Code, Section 515, which gives the
Attorney General the authority to appoint and pay special
attorneys. However, this authority is circumscribed by the
statement that these attorneys “may, when specifically
directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal
proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury pro-
ceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates,
which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to
conduct. . .." It is evident then that this authority
jpertains only to proceedings held within the judicial
system, not to hearings held before a legislative body.
Such a hearing is not a “legal proceeding" and is not
one "which United States Attorneys are authorized by
law to conduct. .. ."

In the event that employees need representation
in a legal proceeding and the Department believes that a
potential conflict of interest would prevent it from
providing counsel, outside counsel could be appointed and
paid under the statute up to the monetary limits fixed.
Whether the Department would allow the individual employee
to designate or select the outside counsel would be a
matter of Departmental policy but we see no reason why
such an individual selection would not ordinarily be
approved.

We are aware that the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) has recently engaged the law firm of Arnold
and Porter and that Mr. Mitchell Rogovin of that firm
has been designated as the individual attorney to represent
that agency. Inquiry with CIA has determined that the
authority relied on for this action is Title 50, United
States Code, Section 403j, which states:

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

"(a) Notwithstanding any other
other provisions of law, sums
made available to the Agency
by appropriation or otherwise
may be expended for purposes
necessary to carry out its
functions, including --

"(1) personal services, including
personal services without regard
to limitations on types of
persons to be employed. .. ."

apparen would emphasize, however, that the counsel
hired,repreSents the CIA, not individual employees, and
that private counsel has the same problems as does their
"in-house" counsel. Therefore, no firm or individual
hired by that agency can provide counsel to the individual
employee in any situation which presents a potential
conflict between the interests of the individual and the
interests of the agency.

CONCLUSION:

We_conclude that +t! no authority for_either
the FBI or the Department _to pay ‘for private counsel
selected by @iiployses_ called _t to_ testify before before the § Senate,
Select Coinittes >or any other legislative body. “If an
employee called to testify in such a forum déSires private
counsel, or where a potential conflict of interest makes
representation by "in-house" counsel or the Department
impossible, the employee must decide if the possible
consequences warrant the personal expense of such counsel
and, if so, responsibility for payment rests with him.

Furthermore, private counsel retained by an
agency having authority to do so would be under the
same disabilities as "in-house" or Departmental counsel
in situations presenting a potential conflict of interest.

agreement for interview of Atlanta Field Office (FO) SA Edward A.

7/22-23/75. \

Supervisor S, F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project
was in- Atlanta 7/22/75 in connection with the interviews there
of six SAs (five from Atlanta FO; one who traveled to Atlanta
from Knoxville FO) by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein and
Mary DeOreo. Interviews concerned the former FBI investigation
of Martin Luther King, Jr. At approximately 5:00 p.m.,
7/22/75, Epstein telephonically contacted Phillips and advised
that one of the interviews developed information resulting in
his desire to interview a seventh SA, Edward A. Shea of the
Atlanta FO. In order to avoid another trip to Atlanta,
Epstein asked if Phillips could obtain FBI clearance for ‘the
interview which would concern: (1) any possible COINTELPRO
operations in Atlanta with respect to King or the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); (2) Shea's assignment

. to a "file review or file rettieval" project during past year
concerning COINTELPRO; and (3) concerning COINTELPRO "generally."
(It should be noted that earlier this year, Shea handled a
project relating to classifying documents in Atlanta files
regarding COINTELPRO. Shea aivised.Phillips of this and also
said that he does not recall seeing any documents regarding
COINTELPRO/SCLC - KING.) Epstein desired to interview Shea
the morning of 7/23/75.

On basis of foregoing request, Phillips
telephonically contacted Assistant Director (AD) Mintz
who granted clearance for (1) and (2) above and suggested
withholding clearance on (3) pending further request from
Epstein after interview on items (1) and (2). Mintz asked
that Phillips touch base with AD Wannall for his concurrence.
In the absence of Wannall who was out of the building,
Deputy AD Ty Leavitt concurred with Mintz, At about 5:30 p.m.,
7/22/75, Epstein was telephonically advised by Phillips as
indicated above--clearance for (1) and (2); not for (3) at
this time. Arrangements were then made for interview of
Shea morning of 7/23/75.

Subsequent interview of Shea (being reported
separately) apparently satisfied Epstein and it does not
appear there will be any further request as to item (3).

This memorandum records that no effort Ws being lite aus
made to respond to a request of the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) dated 6/27/75, pursuant to instructions of the
Deputy Attorney General, until such time as the Department
can obtain clarification from the SSC regarding the meaning
of paragraph 2 in the SSC's letter of 6/27/75.

Memorandum Wannall to Adams, dated 6/30/75, reviewed
a draft copy of the SSC's letter to the Department. This
draft copy is dated 6/25/75. It is identical in content with
the final version dated 6/27/75.

Memorandum Cregar to Wannall, dated 7/2/75, reported
the results of a meeting in the office of the Deputy Attorney
General on the morning of 7/2/75. In this memorandum it was
pointed out that the Deputy Attorney General found considerablé
difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of the SSC's draft of
a letter dated 6/25/75. He noted that in view of the
ambiguities found in the letter, as well as the lack of any
specific agreement entered into with the SSC by the Department
and/or the FBI, the Department should prepare a letter over
the Attorney General's signature asking for clarification.

In the meantime, the Deputy Attorney General advised that we
should take no action responsive to the requests levied on

the FBI in this letter, To date, we have received no infor-
mation from the Department that a letter asking for clarification
of the SSC has been sent

Within the Committee mandate, contained in
S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the
intelligence community which we are required to investi-
gate and study in order to determine the facts and ulti-
mately to, decide whether to make recommendations for
legislative or other changes. They are:

1. _The structure, performance, and utility of
_government operations with respect to intel-
Ligence activities.

2. Whether certain policies or practices are
> or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise
improper.

3. ‘Whether there has or has not been excessive
duplication or inadequate coordination be-
tween and among intelligence agencies and,
more generally, the efficiency of intelli-
_Gence activities.

4, Whether there has or has not been adequate
internal and external control and oversight
over the policies and practices of intelli-
gence agencies.

in attempting to find the answers to these funda-
mental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways.
First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as
instruments of government policy, giving attention to the
authority for particular functions, the problems which
intelligence activities are designed to solve, the proce+
dures by which intelligence activities are and have been
proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated,
the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve
intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of
the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in
depth certain subjects within the broad topics of inves-
tigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion
of other cases that would give added insight into intelli-
gence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific

- subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the

scope contained in the more general questions.

i. Issues

The Committee's inquiry into the intelligence and
counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which
bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation
and administrative organization and procedure. The
Comaittee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence
and counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate
objectives in conformity with the rule of law. Among
the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

“A. What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence
- and counterintelligence activities? Should the
FBI's authority be clarified or revised or

_ incorporated in a comprehensive statutory
eharter?
. B. What limitations are placed on FBI intelligence

and counterintelligence activities by the
Constitution and laws of the United States?
Should these limitations be clarified or
revised?

C. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities?
Should these cbjéctives be modified? i

D. How have the intelligence and counterintelligence
activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated
with other agencies of government? Should these
procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques
of intelligence gathering and dissemination and
counterintelligence operations used by the FBI?
Under what conditions and through what procedures
should these methods and techniques‘be used in
the future?

F. What have been and should.be the mechanisms for
internal and external policy-making, control,
and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter-
intelligence activities?

As a means of examining the above issues in the

the Committee intends to study certain specific
topies, some of which are general in nature, and
others of which involve specific cases, programs

or techniques. Part II, below, contains descriptions
of the general areas into which the Committee: intends
to inquire. Part III contains descriptions. of the
specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions
specifically indicate whether the investigation may
concentrate on specific allegations of possible
abuses or other controversial matters where there

is. reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.
In dddition to the topics described below, additional
areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the
Committee's work.

Areas of General Inquiry

A.

-Legal Authority. for FBI Intelligence and Gounter~
intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI
intelligence and counterintelligence activities.
There may be serious question as to the adequacy
of the present legislative framework for the FBI's
functions in these fields. Current statutes

+ authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law
enforcement functions, but they do not specifically
authorize intelligence or counterintelligence
“activities. Therefore, the Committee seeks to
determine whether the FBI's authority should be
clarified, revised, or incorporated in a compre-
hensive statutory charter. :

Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelli-
gence Division ~ 7

The Committee is investigating the structure and:
operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Divi-
sion. Proposals have been made that the national
security intelligence and counterintelligence
functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate
agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's
criminal investigative activities. Further recom-
mendations have been advanced for improved coordina-

tion between the FBI and other intelligence agencies,

‘for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and
counterintelligence activities by the Attorney
General or an independent board, and for clearer
standards and procedures for FBI activities in this
grea. Therefore, the Committee desires complete
information on the operating practices and proce-
dures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the
field office activities supervised by the Intelli-
gence Division.

NW 55116 DocTd:32989627 Page 43 ~



© The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following
specific areas:

ie FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature
_and purpose of FBI intelligence operations
directed at foreign intelligence activities
and subversive or extremist activities within
the United States. It has been alleged that
the scope of FBI intelligence investigations
is too broad and has extended to legitimate
ie political activities.. Consequently, the Com-
cauea mittee must examine how the FBI's responsibili-
ties have been defined.

2. The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have
been the policies and procedures for coordina-
tion between the FBI and other agencies in the
—U: S. intelligence community. There have been
occasions in the past where friction between
the FBI and other agencies has produced serious
dissatisfaction.within the U. S. intelligence
community. The purpose of this inquiry is to
evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-
, ordinating mechanisms.

FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of
FBI counterintelligence operations directed at
foreign intelligence activities within the
United States or at any other hostile foreign-
related activities within the United States.
Since FBI operations to "counter" these activi-
ties go beyond intelligence collection, the
Committee must consider whether such practices
require statutory authorization. The impact
of counterintelligence operations on United

States foreign relations will also be considered..

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of
the relationships between FBI intelligence

agencies. This subject involves the delicate
balance between the, necessary centralization
of certain law enforcement activities and the
Constitutionally-—mandated decentralization of

Electronic Surveillance

The Committee is examining all forms of electronic
interception of communications including wiretap-
ping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual elec-
tronic surveillance interception of video and data
communications, local monitoring devices, and all
other forms of electronic or technical monitoring.
The Committee's general questions apply to each of
the techniques listed above, as well as to the
matters set forth in the following specific cases.

“1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the
Attorney General should have-the authority
to authorize electronic surveillance for cer-
tain purposes without a’prior judicial warrant.
7 This power has been exercised by succeeding
Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit
directive of the President. The Supreme Court
has ruled that this power does not extend to
purely domestic matters, but the remaining scope
of the Attorney General's authority remains un-
defined by the Supreme Court.

Questions ©
The Committee requests that the FBI and the

Justice Department address the following specific
questions:

a. What is the scope and basis of the claim
of Executive authority to conduct warrant—-
less electronic surveillance?

~ b. What have been the procedures for considera-
tion and approval of requests for warrantless
electronic surveillance authorized by the
Attorney General?

ce. What are the specific disadvantages of the
judicial warrant requirement for those
electroni¢ surveillances which have been
authorized by the Attorney General?

“eon d. Does the Fourth Amendment permit the
. issuance of judicial warrants for elec-
tronic surveillance on grounds other than
ordinary probable cause where national
security intelligence purposes are advanced
to justify the surveillance?

e. To what extent are the specific procedures
of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control
7 Act of 1968 inappropriate for electronic
surveillance conducted for national secu
rity intelligence purposes?

7 Documents

The Committee requests the following additional

. documents bearing on the questions stated above:

F. Clandestine Informant Activities

HW 55116  DocId: 32989627 P.

~ oho

The Committee is examining all aspects of the
FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover
personnel and the techniques employed by such per-
sons. _ Although informants are the single most
productive source of intelligence information, the
difficulties of controlling their activities may
increase the possibility of improper conduct. The
use of informants to infiltrate organizations also

‘ may pose dangers to the right of associational pri-

vacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for
,the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement
or other safeguards for the use of informants.
The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as
well as the contributions of informants to the
accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant
&ctivities with respect to several particular situa-
tions and cases. This investigation may involve
“specific allegations of abuse or controversial
matters where there is reason to believe improprie-—
ties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry
_covers the general circumstances surrounding the
following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;
b. Kent State;
‘¢. > New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

e. United States v. Briggs (Camden);
f. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

o

g- United States v. Marshall (Seattle).
Additional cases may also be examined.

In addition to the above cases, the Committee is
.examining the role of FBI informants in providing
information to the FBI concerning members of the
following organizations:

Phe Ha a. Ku Klux Klan;
b. Students for a Democratic Society;

Additional studies of informant activities with

7 respect to members of other organizations may be
formulated.
e” Questions ; :

. ‘ Department address the following specific questions:

1. With respect to both categories of cases listed
above, what allegations, whether unfounded or
not, of improper, illegal, unethical, or provoca-
tive conduct by FBI informants have been made in

~@onnection with these situations or groups?

2. What measures has the FBI taken to investigate
such allegations of misconduct and to prevent
such alleged misconduct from taking place in the
future? . 7

3. What instructions has the FBI given to its in-

. 7 formants with respect to possible improper,

| : illegal, unethical, or provocative conduct?

4. What has been the largest number of informants,
c » sources, and undercover personnel in use at any
| one time during each year from 1960 until the
7 “present in connection with security, intelli-
gence, and counterintelligence matters, cases,

* "Notional" Organizations

“The Committee is examining the FBI's alleged
ereation of the support for "notional" organizations
for intelligence or counterintelligence purposes.
Although it may rely upon informants and other
elandestine operatives, this alleged practice is
sufficiently novel to require separate attention.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice
«Department address the following specific questions:

1.

What groups, organizations, movements, or other
associations has the FBI caused directly or
indirectly to be formed or created for intel-
ligence or counterintelligence purposes? Please

to the present. +e

What groups, organizations, movements, or

other associations has the FBI supported finan-
cially or materially? Please provide a complete

e

In which cases has the FBI supported or created
such organizations in coordination or coopera-
tion with other agencies?

How have the presence of ‘such "notional" organi-
zations affected the public's perception of the
movements of which they form a part?

How have any FBI programs for the creation and~
support of such groups been coordinated with
any similar programs undertaken by the CIA or

Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Domestic Intelligence Task Forces
U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.
The interview was conducted on 8/4/75 in FBI space and
lasted from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m.

The interview was extremely general in nature and f
dealt exclusively with general information regarding the
handling of informant files both in the field and at FBIHQ.
The questions asked dealt with such matters as what type of at
files were maintained in the field and at FBIHQ regarding £
informants and generally the types of information contained * €
therein. They were particularly interested as to whether or
not an individual informant file either at FBIHQ or in the
field would contain information which would specifically
identify informants other than the informant on which the
file was maintained. They also inquired whether or not there-
was a sub A section of each informant file maintained at FBIHQ
as was the case in the field. Questions were also asked as to
whether or not the individual file maintained at FBIHQ on.
informants would run into several volumes. This inquiry was
answered to the effect that the size of the file would depend
on the activify of the informant, how long he Seay 5 Bas 85S

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy

It was readily apparent that they were asking these
questions with the thought in mind of requesting access to
certain informant files, the identity of which they already
had but did not divulge. They did state specifically that
the informant files in which they would have an interest
amounted to approximately ten and were all on informants
that had publicly beén exposed for one reason or another
and were no longer being operated as current informants.

The indication was that the request would be for access
only to such files for review in FBI space.

SELECT COMMITTEE i

On the afternoon of July 24, 1975, K. William O'Connor, Special
Counsel in the Department, met with Deputy Associate Director Adams
and me to present us with a copy of the proposed procedures and to discuss
any amendments the Bureau might request. Iasked Mr. O'Connor who had
approved this latest draft of the proposed procedures and he said that they
; had been tentatively approved by the Attorney General and the White House.
\ I specifically asked him who in the White House had approved them and

he said that they had been approved by Mr. Buchen (Counsel to the
President). on

WE

Mr. Adams and I discussed the procedures with Mr. O'Connor
and suggested to him as indicated by my inked notation on the bottom of
page 2A that the word "use" used in subparagraph (d) should be further
defined by a footnote that would specify the limitations on information to be
provided the Committee and its staff concerning the identities of persons
to whom the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. Mr. O'Connor
agreed to the proposed change and in our presence telephonically communicated
with John Elliff and obtained his concurrence in the amendment to sub-

paragraph (d). tt 7 io
REC 102 yD -// fn 2957 SA8
Mr. Adams told Mr. O'Connor that the FBI was not agrécing
to the procedures in substance but that we recognized the authority of the
Attorney General in these matters and would abide by his decision that the
proposed procedures would be implemented on agreement by the Committee.
Mr. O'Connor said he understood that and he advised John ELliff that the
Bureau had acquiesced in the proposed procedures with the one amendment
described above. Mr. O'Connor departed indicating that he was going to
proceed to meet with the Committee and obtain final agreement.as to the text
of the propgsed procedures. The draft of the procedures is attached for the

In connection with our responses to

Select Committee (SSC), the
se has instructed that the Intel-
ligence’ Community prepare a briefing for
Senatgrs Church and Tower of the SSC
regafding warrantless electronic surveil-
lances and surreptitious entries. During
meetings of the Intelligence Community, it
as agreed that NSA, FBI and CIA would give
the briefings. No date has been scheduled
for the briefings, although it is antici-
ated representatives of the White House
i11 monitor a preview of the actual brief+
ing to be given Senators Church and Tower.

During meetings of the Intelligence
Community representatives, to discuss the
contents of such a briefing, it was agreed
among representatives of NSA, CIA and FBI
that efforts would be made to avoid identi
fying specific foreign targets of surrepti
tious entries or warrantless electronic
surveillances,

Attached is a memorandum from CIA
advising that CIA has already disseminated

On 8/6/75, Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, III, who was
on the personal staff of former Acting Director Gray, called to advise
that he had been contacted by John Elliff. He had known Elliff casually.
during the confirmation hearings regarding Mr. Gray. ELLiff told him,

which were: (1) the decision to abolish the Crime Records Division; and
(2) the Legal Attache program.

Armstrong told him that he had no knowledge concerning the 4
Crime Records Division and had not even learned of its abolishment until ~
after the fact. Armstrong referred Elliff to Dave Kinley regarding that
topic. Armstrong said that Elliff did not want to talk to him concerning the vi
Legal Attache program over the phone and said he would contact him in tnef, y
near future for an appointment to see him personally.

_¢ Armstrong said he was passing this information along to us in’

1. In our discussions preparatory to the briefing t to
be given to Senators Church and Tower, we have agreed to jak uy
to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of the various
types of operations which will be discussed, although it was
generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid
discussing the Soviet target specifically. I have recently
learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from material}
turned over to them by CIA) that CIA “participated in a series,
of electronic surveillance operations in the U.S."' The infoy-

mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes on to,
say:

2. This being so, it can be expected that the Staff will
have brought this information to the senators' attention, and
I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re-
spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in =
pursuit of NSA requirements, and with FBI coordination and/or Le Sy

support. EX.19) E028 b2-46% 2 3

On July 31, 1975, Mr. Dan Dwyer, Research Assistant, — Pweetersec'y—
Senate Select Committee, advised SA Seymor"F. Phillips that he

leg ot be
had some specific questions to ask concerning his review of. the GEE
Classifying Guide, Files and Communications Division. Thereafter, eae
Supervisor Paul Fv Shes and Classifying tnit Supervisor Odell Bas
Wheeler answered the following questions raised by Mr. Dwyer: 22
(1) Explain the difference in applicant mail categories, i.e. ba

=

67, 77, 116, 151 and 161? The various applicant type categories
were discussed with him. (2) What is the difference between
main files, general files and setup files? These definitions were #;
given to him in accordance with the manual; in addition, our pro-
eedures for handling "0" files, "O00" files and subfiles were also |:
explained. (3) When is a 62 file interchangeable? It was explained¢
to him that the 62 classification is interchangeable with other 4
designated classifications, for example, that incoming 62 material @
could be placed in an existing file on the subject rather than
opening a separate 62 file. (4) Describe what you mean by the
standard sublist. It was explained that a subnumber is assigned cf
to each one of our field offices and to each foreign country; that,
subfiles are. used when it is anticipated that the volume of mail
will be sufficient to place the file in separate subs for future
ready reference to a particular area or locality. (5) What is
the meaning of the character of a case? It was explained that we
have utilized 185 classification numbers to date and that each of
these classifications has a corresponding character. The example
riven was the 26 classification and corresponding ITSMV character. (s)
6) What is meant by the[134)\ classification being interchangeable
with the subvetsive list? It was explained to him that from the
185 classifications approximately 60 of these are termed subversive
from an administrative standpoint. Thefi34|classification which (>)
designates a (Security informant) is interchangeable with certain is
subversive classifications on the subversive list. ;

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

NOTE:

Reference is made to Legal Counsel memorandum to

Jd. B. Adams, dated 7/29/75, captioned "“Senstudy 75," wherein
the request of Mr. Johnson is set forth as well as the approved |
release of Messrs. Smith and Cotter from their employment |
agreement as it relates to the "Huston Plan." On 8/4/75 |
Special Agent Thomas J. NeNiff attempted to contact Mr. Smith |
at his home phone 301-262-1921. An adult female answered and
advised that she was baby-sitting for Mr. and Mrs. Smith who
are currently in New Mexico and are not expected to return |
for an additional two weeks. Special Agent McNiff left his
nane and office phone number with the request that Mr. Smith
¢eall him upon his return to his residence.

Mr. Richard Cotter on 8/4/75 was contacted at his
nome residence phone 256-7227 and advised of the SSC desire
to interview him within the parameter outlined above. Mr. Cotter |
was advised that he has been released from his employment
apreenent withthe above parameter and that should he so request
a Bureau Agent will be made available to him for consultation
at the time of the interview. It was pointed out to Mr. Cotter
that during the interview there are certain privileged areas
concerning which he would not be required to answer questions,
namely: information which might divulge the identities of FBI |
sources; information relating to sensitive methods and techniques; |
information which might adversely affect on-going FBI investigations |
and information which originated with other agencies, including |
|

foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Cotter concluded by saying

that upon being contacted by the SSC ‘he would advise this Bureau |
of the date of the anticipated interview and his decision as to |
whether or not he would request that a Bureau Agent be made |
available for consultation.

Proposed Procedures - SSC Hel faseeaeanecreeiee [Bas
Director Sec'y __ |

This draft of "Proposed Procedures" has ‘not been discussed
with SSC staff. It is intended to reflect the substance of the
discussion had on 7/21, in your office; and incorporates (as
underscored) additional language for the purposes suggested by
that discussion. Also reflected are the slight editorial changes
requested by the SSC in the draft attached to Senator Church's
letter of July 18, 1975.

These procedwes are designed to pammit broad access for .

‘ SSC staff to FBI materials at the FBI, or delivery of such materi als,
i & if appropriate, to the SSC. The present scope of the access is

“NY defined by the requests as received; those extant are the subject

\o og of superseding redraft under paragraph 1. The prospective scope of

XN 3 requested information is not restricted, but is subject to negotiation
Ni . x as indicated in the anendnent to paragraph 1.
go 4
t

The proposed modification of paragraph 3 will be the focus of
most controversy. The SSC will probably object to the withholding
cf sources under paragraph 3(d} (proposed) saying that access to
information at the FBI offices is all that is required; that no
note on such documents can be removed from the premises of the FBI
under procedure 6; and that if they wish to pursue any sources,
the appeal provision of existing paregraph 6 should cover it.

Since that was the purpose of paragraph 6, and since paragraph 6(a)
was designed to focus on any real problem which might arise, the
scope of the stated problem under paragraph 3({d) may be seen by the
SSC as an attempt to withhold information from the SSC staff, and
delay the inquizy (since the Bureau would have to do considerable pre

delivery work under 3(d) to make properly defined and reviewed
deletions). Accordingly, I would expect SSC to assert (a) DOJ
does not trust SSC probity or security, and (b) DOU is following
a dilatory and unnecessary tactic.

In anticipation of these problems, I have re-written
paragraph 9 to permit unilateral abrogation if the procedures
do not work. Uf actual information withheld is. capriciously
defined, or if any lapse of good judgment occurs, I would expect
prompt abrogation by SSC and a yery severe criticism of the

. Director, the Attorney General, and the Department.

I think that is a high risk, and assumption of it places
a very heavy burden upon the Bureau, initially, and upon the
Department, ultimately. 7

My recommendation is that the proposed procedures be
attempted as redrafted, subject to Attorney General and White
House approval; but a vigorous caveat is indicated as to the
need for real restraint in the exercise of initial FBI discretion
under paragraph 3(d).

of specific materials, relevant to the inquiry being conducted under

The Attorney General may exempt specific topical areas of
inquiry from the scope of these procedures. Such topical areas

shall be identified by the Attorney General to the Chairman and

Vice Chairman by letter upon consideration of the lists submitted

dure to be followed shall be proposed, defined, adopted, and

followed after consideration by the SSC of the specific exemption,

and pertinent inquiry and discussion at the staff level.

would identify persons, as sources, who have provided or continue to
provide information to the FBI, and as to whose identity the FBI has
undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. In order to preserve

that obligation of confidentiality, the FBI will withhold access to
this class of information, unless the identity of the individual as

a source has already been made known to the Committee, or unless the

Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chaimman, jointly agree on -

the limited disclosure of such identities to the Chainnan and Vice

Chairman.

(4) Those materials to which the staff has access may be reviewed and
studied in Room 4171 of the Hoover Building and such notes may be

l ve Thank you for your letter replying to our letter concerning

access by certain members of the Select Committee to files and
documents concerning them held by the Department, including the
FBI. 7

The Committee has resolved to adopt a slightly different

insights into how theDepartment of Justice, including the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, collects, maintains and retrieves See eet
for itself material on Americans generally. Accordingly, we 7
suggest that at a mutually convenient time, the designated members
come to the Department or the Bureau and physically go through
the retrieval process with the persons who would be responsible
for performing that function in a real life situation. The
Committee members do not wish to have their individual files -
either removed from the filing system or "sanitized" prior to . 4S J 7
their reviewing then. x : + po + ee Ei)

This proposed method of o ite review may help, moreover,
to alleviate the possible problems of disclosure to the particular
members which your letter adverted to. We are sure that you
could discuss any remaining actual problems with the members
themselves at your premises, including whatever retrieval problems
may exist with respect to the letters from the members themselves ©
which you referred to. © JUL 25187:

In the first instance, what the members seek is insight, asus

, x procedure than that proposed in your letter. As you know, the F
= purpose of this particular request is to enable the members, ALY

’

Also enclosed is a copy of SAC memorandum 23-75
dated May 27, 1975, which is believed responsive to 5.8. This
particular SAC memorandum is being provided herewith, since,
in view of its recent date, it.vas not included in the index
of SAC Letters and Memoranda previously made available to
the SSC Staff,

With regard to that portion of 5.¢., above, concerning
"possible entrapment, provocation, interference with lawyer -
client relationship or other problems," as it relates to
informant operation, there are no Bureau memoranda or other
material addressing these areas, as the same policy and
procedures applicable to Special Agent conduct cegarding these
problems similerly apply to informants. In response te your
general request under 4,b., above, FBI policy and procedures
concerning such matters are set forth in the Manual of
Instructions (MOI) and the Manval of Rules and Regulations (MRR),
vhich have already been made available to SSC Staff Members
pursuant to an earlier request and to the SAC Letters and
Memoranda which are being made available to SSC Staff personnel
for review pursuant to another request.

With respect to your request under Item 4.a., above,
no memoranda or other materials were Located relating to the
original decision to utilize informants in our investigations.

It is noted your requests under Item 5., Appendix A,
of referenced communitation were directed by you to both the
FBI and the U. 5. Department of Justice (D0J), Our response
in this matter with respect to legal authority should therefore
be viewed in conjunction with any material you may have received
or Will receive from the U. S. DOJ.

heading of "Salaries and Expenses" for "expénses necessary for the.
detection and prosecution of crimes against the United States" and
more specifically for the "payment of rewards, Me L

At page 879 of these hearings, there is set forth
as part of the testimony on "Investigative Accomplishments, " a
paragraph detailing the statistics achieved by the use of confidential
informants. Since Congress has approved FBI appropriations without
objection to the use of money for "payment of rewards" or for the
informant achievements listed in the testimony, the approval of the
appropriations serves as one form of legislative approval for the
use of informants.

* The use of informants does not violate the defendant's
rights under the Fourth Amendment. Hoffa v. United States, 385
U.S. 293 (1966). 2 Bee

“Neither this Court, nor any member of it has
ever expressed the view that the Fourth Amend~
ment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief
that a person to whom he voluntarily confides
his wrongdoing will not reveal it. Indeed, the
Court unanimously rejected that very contention
---in Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427---"

‘Id.at 302

The Court also held that the use of an informer did
not violate Hoffa's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments,
1 citing United States v. Dennis, 183 F.2d 201, 224, (1950), which
; said,

"Courts have countenanced the use of informers
from time immemorial; in cases of conspiracy,
or in other cases when the crime consists of
preparing for another crime it is usually necessary
to rely upon them or upon accomplices because
|’ the criminals will almost certainly proceed

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT BM SNe

" FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535 ,

May 27, 1975

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) INFORMANT MATTERS - DEFENSE PLANS AND STRATEGY --.
Recently there have been several instances where attorneys in connection
with law suits have publicly and erroneously alleged that the FBI utilized
informants to uncover defense plans and strategy. Also, recently a former
informant falsely alleged that informant's services were utilized by the
Bureau to infiltrate a defense camp. These accusations reemphasize the
need for the careful and professional handling of informants at all times.

As you are aware under current policy, informants are advised
to avoid becoming involved in defense plans or strategy in subversive-type
cases or with anyone under criminal indictment. It is the responsibility
of all Special Agents handling informants to insure that their informants
are continually alert so that they will avoid becoming invoived in defense -
matters and in the event an informant is requested to assist or partake in
such matters, that the contacting Agent is immediately advised so that the
matter will be recorded. If the iniormajit cannot aveid being involved,
informant is not to report any information pertaining to defense plans or
strategy and such incident must be prompily reported to the Bureau under
the substantive case caption.

In view of the above, the statement of cooperation normally
signed by security and extremist informants is being amended to incorporate
current policy regarding defense plans and strategy. Where it is not required
as in criminal informant cases or it has not been practical to obtain a state- -
ment of cooperation, each handling Agent must orally advise the informant
of the above, reduce it to writing, and record it in the informant's file. Insure
that all pending informant files reflect the above as a matter of record.

Manual changes follow.

the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them,
and how to get rid of them. It is contemplated that we will set up
a Legal Attache's Office, with.a group of 20 to 25 men, for the’ purpose
of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican ‘Govern-
ment and advising the government of those. who may try to infiltrate
into the government. This activity would take place first in, the
city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until
_&11 communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been
advised. 7 “3

valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making
certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau
in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in
other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the
heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to
assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success,
teamwork is a must.

%

queer

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing
quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the
Dominican Republic. z

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish
to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption
of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current)
who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of
your office who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of
nationality) who-may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent)
in the Dominican Republic if-such is considered feasible by Legal Attache, ©
Santo Domingo. .- : 7 : . =

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by
teletype.

: In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,
your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved

in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant develop-
ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each
office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial
numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the
territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage
sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature,
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data
ncerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field
considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be
overcome promptly a instituting an aggressive informant development

LEGAL ATTACHE'S OFFICE,
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC .

set up a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of .
the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them, ~
and how to get rid of them. It is contemplated that we will set up
a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose |
of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Govern-
ment and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate {
into the government. This activity would take place first in the j
city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until
all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Goverhment has been
advised.

All of the agents to be sent down should be flucut in Spanish
and we should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood, which
will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.

Relative to the Legal Attache, he should be a top man, fully
experienced, as he will be dealing with the President of the Dominican
Republic and with our Ambassador there. —

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN
AMERICA)-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache
if Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, whohas already begun to make a
yaluablé contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making
certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the
United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new
Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed,
current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well
become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin :
America threatened with communism. {

N

= b6- OY 9345)

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau
in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in
other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the
heaviest and most fa: caching burden the FBI has ever been asked to
assume in the in nrentag anr eampl ate snecess,

teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist
Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing
quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the
Dominican Republic.

FILED

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish
W Within‘five days “éf'the receipt of this letter under the caption --
of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following: }

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources
for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by
teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau,
your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and
sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained
during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved
in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated lela develop-
ment program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each
office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial
numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the
territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage
Suificient to alert you to exile organizational activities uf poiiiical nature,
plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data
concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field
is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be
- overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development

program.

J. C. Farrington to Mr. McDermott Memo
REQUEST BY U.S. SENATOR WALTER F.
MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER
TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES

In above file references, we had seven documents
containing masked out portions. As these masks will be

| removed prior to replacing in our files, a Xerox of the
pertinent portion of the respective documents have been
made for record purposes and attached to this memorandum.

S
Concerning (ios-120989-94 fepartment of State
letter to FBI dated April 10, 1969, Senator Mondale
advised he had recevied a copy of this letter from the
State Department.

Concerning 62-110783-68 report of SAA Dale E.
Berglund dated March 10, 1966, at Minneapolis captioned
"MILES WELTON LORD; United States Attorney District of
Minnesota, Administrative Inquiry ~ Bribery," Mr. Adams
mentioned to Senator Mondale there were privacy considera-
tions concerning this report and Senator Mondale limited
his review of this document to information pertaining
: to himself set forth on pages 355 and 36.

ACTION: For Information.

Memorandum for Mr. McDermott :
Re: REQUEST BY U. 8. SENATOR WALTER F.
‘-  MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
MEMBER, TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES

The Senator raised a question concerning a folder on the
Consumers Advisory Council, of which he was a member (62-108230-1)
and inquired how we came into possession of this particular report. I
determined that this report had been sent to Mr. Hoover in September,
1962, by Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, as he
felt Mr. Hoover would be interested in reading the report. I advised
Mr. Aaron that the report had been sent to Mr. Hoover by a friend of
his in the newspaper field.

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to your memorandum July 16, 1975,
captioned as above, requesting information relating to the ate
| collection, analysis, use, and dissemination of _organized, yy
_Grineintelligence and a second request related to what extent
“have communications between the White House and the FSI or

communications be chamneled through the Attorney General. y Decree!

Ly

In vesponse to the first matter, on June 25, i974,
I testified before the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the
Senate Judiciary Committee that the Bureau has "no statutory 4
authority to collect intelligence per se" but that it operates
under the general umbrella of 28 U.S.C. 533 (3), which
authorizes the Attorney General to appoint officials "to
coniuct...investigations regarding official matters...as may
be directed by the Attorney General," A listing of any
directives issued by the Department or the Attorney General
with respect to organized crime should be available in the
office of the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,

The Attorney General.

Lost of this information 1s obtained from paid
informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert
citizens, and from court-approved clectronic surveillances
installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

Hone of it, however, is intelligence for intclligence's
sake. The experionce of the FBI over the years has show that
criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting
illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may
reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these
activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organiacd
underworld are not aimed at developing general nonspecific
data but at establishing which criminal violations its members
i arpa in and then proving these violations in a court
of law.

Obviously, not every case opened, covery cad followcd,
or overy bit of information reccived is going to wind up in
Federal court. On the contrary, much of this material relates
to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the
FBI. ‘hen such is the ease, we immediately dissominate tho
information to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency.
As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past
five years alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make
more than 17,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over
151,000,000 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, {9,000,000
worth of cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia,
and .°6,000,000 vorth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax
liens against 19,000,000 worth of property arising out of
Federal gambling cases.

In addition, a considerable portion of the organized
crime intelligence information develonea by the FBI is for-
warded to the various Federal Strike Forces coordinating
vacket investigations throughout the country and to the
criminal Division of the Department, which has entored this
infomation in its computerized data bank called "Racketcer
rrofile."

DocId:32989627 Page 251



NW 55116 DocId:32989:

The Attorney General

In response to the socond request in your letter,
my answer is restricted to communications between the white
House and the PBI as it would not be appropriate for me to
attexpt to respond for other agencies under your jurisdiction.

There are two major areas in which the Attorney
General doos not soe communications between the thite House
and the FBI. They are tho results of name checks and the
results of full ficld investigationswe do for the thite House.
The White House requests approximately 13,000 name checks per
year concerning persons who visit the thite House complex who
could pose a physical threat or possible embarrassment to tho
President directly or indirectly. Aoproximately 1,000 full
fiold background investigations on Presidential appointees,
uembers of the White House staff, and other persons having
regular access to the White House are requested annually.

I direct your attention to Section 0.15 (b) (7),
Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, which states that the
Deputy Abtorney General shall “Coordinate Departmental liaison
with the “hite House staff and the Executive Office of the
President." ‘hen this order was promulgated there wore
discussions betieon the Department and Bureau officials as
to its Implomentation and its impact on oxicting direct
liaison between the FBI and the White House. ky letter to
the Attorncy Gonoral, Nay 2, 1974, captioned "Revision of the
Departnont of Justico Organization Regulations (28 CFR fart 0),"
sot forth tho FBI's need for a Special Agent-Liaison officer
to handle day ta day opcrational liaison with the thite House.
His activities were outlined and it was requested that he
continue to handle operational probleus on a daily basis
with specific individuals because of the sensitivity of the
natters involved, both of a personal security and intelligence
nature.

By memorandua dated May 16, 1974, captioned "Direct
Operational Liaison with the “hite House," the Attorney General
authorized the continuance of FBI direct operational liaison
with the thite House.

Page 252



The Attorney General

Vth the exceptions as noted above, the FBI has |
adhered to a policy that when information is given to the
Uhite House the Attorney General is given the same information
contemporaneously. Most of this information relates to current
matters pertaining to the national sccurity. This dissemination
to the White House is sometimes based on roquests from the
Vihite House but more frequently on the initiative of the FBI.

With regard to any correspondence directed to this
Bureau from the Vhite House, short of a file by file revicv,
there is no means of determining whether or not such communica-
tions bypassed the Attorney General.

The established rule of furnishing the Attorney
General copies of correspondence to the White House should be
followed strictly so that the Attorney General is kept fully
informed on matters of interest to hin.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75

He was advised by SA Daly that we had previously received requests

for the interview of a number of employees in Atlanta, Georgia, by the
Committee and that upon receipt of the attached communication, after
consultation with Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination
Michael Shaheen, SA Daly had telephonically informed John Elliff, head
of the domestic intelligence task force for the Committee, of the
Department's interpretation as set forth in the attached document and

the fact that Mr. Elliff should contact Mr. O'Connor concerning these
proposed interviews. Mr. O'Connor said that he had been contacted by
Mr. Elliff and had, in fact, told Mr. Elliff there would be no interviews.
In this regard, O'Connor stated the Department had prepared a proposed
draft letter to the Committee expressing concern for the Fifth Amendment
rights for Bureau employees and raising other legal issues. Mr. O'Connor
indicated that the finalized form of this letter should be sent to the
Committee in the near future.

The results of the conversation with John Elliff by O'Connor
hawe caused the Office of Legal Analysis to recéive complaints concerning
this decision from various Committee staff members, including Mark
Gitenstein and Michael Epstein. We can anticipate, unless this particular
problem is resolved, receiving protests from their superiors on the
Committee,

RECOMMENDATION:
You will be kept advised of developments concerning this

matter. Legal Analysis Office will continue efforts to determine what
effect this will have on the GAO inquiry.

SUBJECT: Interpretation of "Demand",
28 C.F.R., 8 16.21, et. sed. — Action Memorandum

The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in
the C.F.R. sections indicated. This omission creates a need for an
interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the
White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1975, anda
copy of those procedures was furnished to the Department on June 16,
1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the
Conmittee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time before
the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former
employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in
the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with
a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or
agreements for the purpose of this ind ". The Committee is required
to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-
ject area; (b) periods of employment; (c) the date set for the interview.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the
Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it
seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., § 16.21, et. seq.,
which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request
by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee
or other person connécted with the Department of Justice.

This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit-
ness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Department
Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated.
I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should
be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General popes in coordination
with this office.



As a matter of current practice, the PBI and other components
of the Department are presently coordinating with me on agreements
for disclosure under § 16.23, as a system for ensuring that they are
receiving treatment consistent with the outlines of inquiry procedure
and-the agreements between the Committee and the Department.

If you approve, I will advise the involved components of the’
Department of Justice that the word "demand" will be interpreted as.
indicated for each witness.

On July 23, 1975, Mike Gitenstein, staff
member Senate Select Committee, requested that he
be given a briefing concerning "Official and Con-,
fidential" files. By way of background, we furnished
a summary of the inspection inquiry to the Committee
by letterhead memorandum dated 7-16-75, and also
made available for review in Bureau space a list of
people contacted during the course of this inquiry.

With regard to Gitenstein's request it would
appear beneficial for us to brief the Senate Select
Committee representative concerning the scope and
details of this inquiry. In this regard it appears
Gitenstein is interested in those individuals who
were. contacted by the Inspection Division during their
iaeverr ot into the "Official and Confidential"

‘iles.

If approved the briefing will be tentatively
scheduled for Friday, July 25, 1975.

By memorandum dated June 24, 1975, you were
advised of the Department's intention to make a closed
Departmental file-available to captioned Committee.

file contained the results of a criminal investigation
conducted by the Bureau. The Intelligence, General
Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions were
requested to furnish their views concerning this matter
and the Legal Counsel Division was to prepare a letter
to the Department setting forth the Bureau's position
with regard to this matter.

We have since had discussions with the Attorney
General and other representatives of the Department concerning
Senate Select Committee access to Bureau files and
submitted correspondence to the Department concerning
this matter. It would appear additional communications
to the Department are unnecessary. The Department is
well aware of our position in this matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

We do not prepare a communication to the
Department concerning this matter.

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC); INTERVIEW OF ASSTSTANT
DIRECTOR IN CHARGE ROBERT E. GEBHARDT BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 7, 1975, Assistant Director Robert E.
Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los
Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of
the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by
Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of the
, interview, that is i e as it
' related to the FBL's investigation of the Black”Panther Party

The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,
and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any
Bureau representative.

Gebhardt bad previously been advised by a Bureau
representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas
of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters

of interview. ———————
ener poemenensanntuetiannanttined

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt
was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther
Party investigation on a day-to-day basis being specifically
advised details of the investigation as it relates to the
,Cointel Program. It was explained to Seidel that as Special
Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein
over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had
Many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

therefore, relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment
of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the
day-to-day direction of the various matters under investigation,
including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was
encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,
Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for
such consultation to resolve any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC
when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and
the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually
terminated. Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage
was already in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival, however, he
does recall receiving a phone call after the "Keith Decision"
was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of
the BPP and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.
The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the
discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the
intelligence type investigations should be completely removed
from the criminal investigations which investigations would be
looking toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal
investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence
information is obtained from time to time which really has no
value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible
value with respect to the direction of the investigation. In
some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence
information may be obtained and in other types, very little.
Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is
made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be
a basis for an investigation which procedures would include
matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

In some instances, in such security investigations
a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained
therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-
.gence type investigations should not be removed from or
differentiated from criminal type investigations looking
toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an
outgrowth of the basic investigation.

AW 55116 DocId:32989627 Page 270



Gebhardt was asked if he felt the Cointelpro was a
separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation
and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the
overall investigation in any particular organization or
individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact
legislation which would set forth specific investigative
techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or
other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in
Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted,
and in reply to the question as to why such legislation should
not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative
agency, there must of necessity be allowéd a certain flexi-
bility because no two investigations are exactly alike and the
circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be
related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should
assure the American public that questionable activity such
as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative
agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress
and the American people must rely upon the integrity and
honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the

FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President,
hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees
and finally approved by the Senate. It was further pointed
out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with
the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention
of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and

£ circumstanc ever arose which circumstances he could not

(conteuplaceds this time, wherein it was thought such

activi-tiés shéuld be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal
approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting.
Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with
this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were
relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI
and Congress. He was informed that a Senate Oversight
Committee was recently established and it was felt that this
was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

\ AW 55116 DocId:32989627 Page 271



standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular
inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as

to our activities.

He was informed that there should be

either a joint oversight committee between the House and

Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees
in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the

entities through which all information relative to the
activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be

Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative

between the Department of Justice and

the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's
opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed
up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely

oversight procedure of the activities
regard to the confidentiality of many

of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure
itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will
maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters
as national defense, national security
or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations
must be based on the application of the facts toward a
particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique
clearly applied to a particular Federal
statute, consultation with the Department of Justice should
be had in all instances.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

reportedly voiced his displeasure to O'Flaherty stating he

did not approve of the latter's action. (The memorandum in
question dealt with CIA's possible use of derogatory information
to determine the direction Senator Jackson would take in future
actions he might encounter which might involve CIA activity si) ()
Thweat advised he would recontact his relative to determing if
this individual would come forward, reveal his identity and

be cooperative in any investigation.

. ' A memorandum from CIA dated 7/29/75 indicates that
James Daniel O'Flaherty, born 11/4/42, is a member of the Staff (s)

of SSC and has been granted a security clearance up to "Top cos

si
On the morning of 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office was

telephonically contactéd and instructed to expedite a contact

with Thweat to determine the availability of his relative. At

approximately 2:30 p.m., 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office advised

that Thweat, upon recontact,‘had stated that it would be impossible

to contact his relative before this coming weekend. In conver-~

sation, he identified his relative as a niece who is currently

attending school in nington, D. C.. He further advised that

O'Flaherty reportedly is no longer residing with his wife and

. is engaged in an emotional relationship with his niece. Thweat

added he believed his niece would be cooperative as she has
expressed her disapproval of O'Flaherty's action. He concluded
by saying that upon cztermination of his niece's decision in
this regard he would ediately advise the Philadelphia Office.

OBSERVATIONS: .

: The above information, if accurate, represents a
serious violation of the agreement regarding confidentiality
existing between the SSC and members of the intelligence commu-
nity as it relates to material being turned over or made
available to Staff Memvers of the Committee, It is incumbent

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: ‘Senstudy 75
62-116395

upon this Bureau to make the above information available at
the earliest logical time and in the most complete form
possible to the Department, CIA, and Senators Frank Church
and John G, Tower of the SSC. Accordingly, an interview by
Bureau Agents of Thweat's niece, if she agrees to cooperate,

* would appear desirable before initiating any action on the

basis of information received to date.

Additionally, it is not known at this time whether

‘or not the document reportedly Xeroxed by O'Flaherty is

classified. In our continuing inquiry into this matter,
attempts will be made to identify document, determine whether
it contains classified information and ascertain whether or
not a violation of Federal statutes exists,

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. That contact.be maintained with the Philadelphia
Office to insure that the desired information concerning
Thweat's niece be expeditiously obtained. If she agrees to
cooperate, she will be immediately interviewed and pertinent
information obtained . furnished, via established liaison
channels,to the Department, CIA, and Senators Church and Tower.
Appropriate field offices will be instructed to conduct
necessary investigation to corroborate the information and
to determine if a possible violation of Federal statutes has
been committed,
