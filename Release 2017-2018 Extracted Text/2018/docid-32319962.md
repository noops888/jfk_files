all of the information requested by the FBI or to open the
documents in full. The release of the information in these 61
documents will reveal the identities of 158 individuals who were
described as potential criminal informants (PCI), potential
security informants (PSI), security informants (SI), Cuban
sources, sources of information (SOI), confidential sources (CS)
panel sources and established sources; release foreign
counterintelligence information.

(U) The ARRB held a public meeting 6/5/96, and voted on
new operating procedures. The rules will decrease the number of
members needed to make a quorum to three. This may impact the
forthcoming decisions for the FBI, since a vote only takes a
majority. Two of the ARRB members normally present at meeting
are very pro-disclosure oriented.

(U) The 61 documents pertaining to the decisions from
the current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed
below by document number with the information to be released.

The current status of informants and sources, if found through
research, is noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D)
no record (NR) or date of birth (DOB).

(U) The FBI provided written justifications arguing
the need to protect the individuals, singular information, and
-classified information related to methods, sources, and foreign
relations as listed above. However, the ARRB supports the
position that the information ordered disclosed is relevant and
significant to the assassination and that it outweighs any harm
that would be caused to the individuals or the FBI's/United
States Government's foreign relations to be disclosed.

(U) If NSD or CID recommend appeal, they are

serve to declassify a sensitive technical coverage on a Soviet
establishment. Disclosure that the FBI has a technical coverage
on Tass would have an adverse effect on the FBI's
counterintelligence capabilities and U.S. foreign relations with
Russia. It would also likely result in countermeasures against
such coverages and thereby lessen their effectiveness. ay u)

#54 & #55 - NSD rec ends the FBI appeal the release
of information that indicates/telephone surveillance of_a SI
dedicated telephone circuit between the U.S. and Russia.] As
previously articulated by the JFKTF, investigative metHods and
techniques such as telephone surveillance may vary in
application, but do not normally diminish in importance with
time. Public exposure of the FBI's specific use of same would
cause harm to the FBI's foreign counterintelligence
capabilities. 4)

Furthermore, the U.S. State Department has orally
advised the FBI to protect all information relating to
investigations of Russia. The U.S. is currently allied with
Russia, with Russian troops under United States command in
Bosnia; and the FBI is currently attempting to establish friendly
relations with Russian Government officials to fight terrorism,
organized crime, drugs and other criminal activities. Disclosure
of the above technical surveillance would harm these developing
relationships and could cause the Russian Government to feel
compelled to publicly address these embarrassing revelations. Lo)

#59 - The ARRB sustained the postponement of two
classified file numbers until August, 1996. The subject matter
of these FBIHQ and New Haven file numbers concerns the
utilization of a mail cover to gather intelligence information on
persons in contact with the Soviet Embassy. The purpose of
initiating investigations of persons in contact with certain
foreign establishments is to determine whether the person poses a
threat to national security through access to classified
information or technology; and to assess the person's asset
potential. Public disclosure of such coverage would cause harm
to the FBI's foreign counterintelligence investigative
capabilities and harm foreign relations. (x (u

#60 & #61 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the release
of information which_reveals(technical surveillance of
the Israeli Consulate\in New York in order to protect this
sensitive investigative technique. It is further noted that on
5/1/96, U.S. State Department official emphasized the importance
