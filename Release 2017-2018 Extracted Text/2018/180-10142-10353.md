with Joseph Piccolo, Jr. Mr. Piccolo, age 43, is presently an employee
of the CIA working as an operations officer in the Deputy Directorate of
Operations. He joined the CIA in 1957 and, with the exception of one year
of duty with the Air Force, has continued until the present time in his
employment with the Central Intelligence Agency.
Prior to the beginning of the interview Mr. Piccolo was asked to read
the CIA's omnibus release letter of 23 March 1978. After his examination
of the letter, Mr. Piccolo indicated that he fully understood the letter's x
meaning. Mr. Berk then explained to Mr. Piccolo the mandate and: purposes « '
of the Select Committee. :
Mr. Piccolo stated that at the time of President Kennedy's assassination
he was a support assistance analyst in the DDO. His responsibilities
included maintenance of records, running of traces, and Spanish language
analysis for purposes of operational support. Subsequent to this position
Mr. Piccolo undertook training during the spring of 1964 to become an
operations officer. Mr. Piccolo further stated that his professional

areas of interest were mainly concerned with Latin America. He also in-

dicated that he served in tnd(cra‘s Mexico City Station fron]

August 1965 to January 1968.) It was further

ascertained that Mr. Piccolo was involved in some Agency operations
directed against Cuba during the time periods 1962 to January 1968,
January 1969 to January 1970, and a three month period during 1975.

Mr. Piccolo was asked if he was familiar with the cryptonym AMMUG/1.
He responded affirmatively and stated that A/l was thefirst Cuban Intel-

ligence Service (CUIS) defector from the then newly formed DGI, the CIA's

Cuban counterpart for external security and counter-intelligence operations.

Mr. Piccolo stated that he did not participate in the initial handling
and debriefing of A/1 but became involved in this case during the summer of
1964 when he first met A/1. At that time, Mr. Piccolo was assigned to
“handhold" A/1; i.e., to ensure that A/l was properly accomodated and
escorted and to provide companionship for A/1l.

Mr. Piccolo recalled that A/1 had been debriefed|in Canada fafter his
defection. He stated that the objectives’ of the initial debriefings would
have been to gain biographic data on persons associated with the Cuban
Intelligence Service and information on persons who might collaborate
with the CIA. He indicated that he ceased contact with A/1 prior to 1966

and the last information he had was that A/1 was residing

Florida and was adjusting well to life in this country.

As for the filing of the debriefing reports, Mr. Piccolo said the
filing procedure would habe been dictated by the manner in which the case
was handled; i.e., by subject or cryptonym or personality. He did state
that debriefing reports would hale initially been held in the office
handling the case. ‘These xepors would halve been "held tight" to allow

ce ae
time for operations to be developed while security risks abd at a minimum.
However, not
‘FAN Mr. Piccolo said he didknow where such debriefing reports would now
be located.

Mr. Piccolo later became responsible for debriefing A/1. Mr. Piccolo
was not able to recall the exact time period during which he debriefed

which continaca For i : i
A/1 Ate approximately a four to six month period. Mr. Piccolo stated that

[Leroi Swenson, Barney Hidalgo and Dan mores }so debriefed A/1.

Mr. Piccolo was queried as to the responsibilities of WH, , the



Piccolo Interview, Page 3.

CIA component responsible for the A/1 case. He indicated that this component,

whose chief waq Harold swenson porked against the CUIS. He further indi-

cated that WH, to carry out its function, probably ran

operations.

Mr. Piccolo was next queried whether he recalled a CIA component
referred to as the “domestic exploitation section". Mr. Piccolo stated
that this temninology was not familiar to him but that domestic exploitation
would most likely have been located in a positive intelligence section of
the Agency such as the Domestic Contacts Division. He did state, however, -
that recruitment or contact of persons in this country for utilization in
foreign operations would have been the responsibility of every operations
officer. He doubted that the Western Hemisphere Division would have run
such an office but that operational recruitment would halve been handled
as part of a specific project or program.

Mr. Piccolo was queried whether A/1 providied any information to the
CIA on Lee'Harvey Oswald and his possible contacts with the DGI. He
responded that he recalls no A/l debriefing reports providing such infor-
mation nor did A/1 provide such information to him. Mr. Piccolo further
declared tha{ ussrs. Swenson, Hidalgo, and lores) never indicated to him
that A/1 had ever provided any information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

Mr. Piccolo was next queried as to the meaning of the term "Special
Intelligence." He indicated that the term usually applies to the inter-
ception of communications, e.g., signal intelligence which would include
radio waves and radar but would not have included electronic surveillance.

Mr. Piccolo further stated that special intelligence would haife been

handled by } special unit segregated from other agency

identity he was unable to recall, had shown him the pictures saying:
(paraphrase) "These are the pictures of Oswald that we got in Mexico."
He stated that he was led to understand that these two pictures had been
taken of Lee Harvey Oswald either entering or leaving the Cuban Embassy/
Consulate in Mexico City.’ The first picture was a 3/4 full shot of
Oswald exposing his left profile as Oswald looked downward. ‘The second
photograph which Mr. Piccolo recollected seeing was a back of the head
view of Oswald. At this point in the interview Mr. Piccolo was shown
CE 237, the famous photograph of the Mexico Mystery Man. All printed

said that Ann Goodpasture may have been the person who found a photograph

of Oswald in Mexico City. He stated that he has heard several times that

contact the Committee. Mr. Piccolo stated that during the course of
