inquired of him vhether tho suurce had over been questioned on hie possible i ;
knowledge of the FIELB Case. bt ESI ate) thet he did not believe that { li
any euch querien had been put to SEVISICY, but t the same thought hed :

croesed his own mind only a short tine ego. Mr indicated that the i

volume of requirements vhich had had to be vorked into the schedule of source ‘
debriefings was oo great, thet thie was but one of » viole series of cases iy

and personalities wiich shoulé be covered with REVICICN as the time allows.

Ia view of the fact that Mr lwas plonping to see HEVIBIOR that afternoon, !

he suggested that it might be edvicable Zor hin to dtecuos the matter with i

the source tumsdietely, and ettempt to ferret out wheter BEVISICH could provide i i

{| ‘been discussed in Poland, he, the source, had gained the impression that the

facts of the cuss vers pretty mich as revesled at the time of Eermenn FIELB's

i from sourea's Soviet Intelligence Contacts to indicate that any of the FIELDS
