that the Soviet Uovernment vas shirking ite responsibilities in this situation
by attempting to wash ite hande of the Cernan question. “Clastonbury etated that
the efgning of the peace treaty was nothing elee tuan placing the natch in the
Kast Oeraan hands with which they could ignite the “tinder box". Klimov protested
that the tinder box hed existed for many years and that their siming the peace
treaty was “only signing a Y8K piece of paper" and not passing the uatch to the
Kast Germans. Kiirov then suggested that Cleetonbury's government join hands
with the Boviets and eign the treaty. Clastonbury replied that he did not believe
that Bie governnent would ever sign such an agreement. Clastonbury suggested
that the Soviet Government in lieu of signing the treaty pursue a course of
honest negotiz.tion to resolve the question. Klimov stated that Khrushchev in
hie speeches had indicated the Soviet Government's willingness to inolude the
U.S. in negotiating the final version of the peace treaty with East Germany.

Glastonbury suggested that Klimov attempt to let it be known to Khrushchev, altho igh

he underatood that Klimov was in no such position as to be able to tell Khrushchev
what to do, that Khrushchev etcp engaging in public eppeches end etart. negotiating
$f he really desires peace. KXiimov stated t at Khrushchev's speechos were indeed

negotiation and asked Clestonbury what he thought negotiation should be. Clastonbur;

retorted that, as he understood it, negotiation took into account the viewpoint
‘of both sides and was not amstter where a fait accompli was prosented in a public
speech with a request that the other eide merely conour. -Clastonbury pointed
out thet einos.the end of the war the United States hed presented many proposals
for the settlement of the German queation and that time and time again it was
Klimov'a governnent that refused even to noxotiate on the principles of those
proposala. Clastonbury was surprised to see khrushohev pull « solution out

of his hat and expect another foverutent to merely eipn on the dotted line.
Klimov did not counter any of these statements but suggested that the U.S. had
