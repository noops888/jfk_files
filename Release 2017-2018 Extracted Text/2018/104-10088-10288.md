3. Under the extraordinary

effort to develop information

on the assassin and

the assassination, copies of the photograph were

made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the afternoon of

22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,

assertedly on the decision of

the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by

an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval

investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was shown to

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the

evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM

6. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his stay in

2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man

Assuming, and

allowing for the fact of late arrival and early

Overall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods

during 27, 28 September and 1 October. All coverage by CIA during

the

entire period was technical. The Station had no live

source (living

agent) coverage either unilateral or from Mexican liaison.

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense "under investi-

gation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in the USSR and

return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were known

It is, therefore, firm

that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his

is unknown. The time of his second Cuban Embassy visit was about

OSWALD made at least two calls,

and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV. There

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follow-

of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to

the Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of

the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on l October were

concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with

a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual

observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked

to

Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,

"appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified
