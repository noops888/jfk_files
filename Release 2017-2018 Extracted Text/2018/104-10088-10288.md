Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the morning of
2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man
originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is important, therefore, to

Overall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods
during 27, 28 September and 1 October. All coverage by CIA’ during the

entire period was technical. The Station had no live source (living

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense “under investi-

gation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in the USSR and
return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were know Mexico Station files
before 10 October 1963, when the bare. his biography were

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with H
a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual
observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to
Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,
“appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual.as "The American."

There can be no question that this meee Mexico Station report

was an analyst's error which escaped de} ‘jn the coordination before
