Re Bureau cable 12-21-64.

We have alerted officials of the Police Judiciaire
(Criminal Police), Sfreté Nationale (PJSN), to the possibility
subject and FUEGER may be in France in the future and have
requested our sources to attempt to ascertain the amount of
money in subject's possession if he does come to their attention.

Paris has no information indicating subject plans
to meet FUEGER in Paris and then travel to Zurich, Switzerland,
as set forth in reBucab. Please furnish any additional data
re travel plans which can be given to our sources.
