As a result of the Warren Commission proceedings. (Liaison

(and the rest of the world know that JKLANCE has photographic

coverage of

tho Cuban Mission.

However, to the best of our

snowledge, no one knows where it is or who does it

This is

confirmed by (KDAFGHAN photos showing Cubans, and others, shaking

their fists at a house which is not the KDAFGHAN site.

In our

request to (liaison to remove the offending traffic sign, Head-

quarters may be assured that we did not tell (Liaison the

true

l'eason

for our l'equest.

They were told that it sometimes

interfered with physical surveillance. (Liaison) in turn gave

the same request to the appropriate contact

in the traffic

police, using the explanation that their surveillance team

wanted the sign removed.
