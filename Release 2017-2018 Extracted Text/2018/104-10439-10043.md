According to & 1955 RI check conducted on one Alexander So

MORIOFF for G-2, a report of 17 May 1950 advised that ORLOFT (ino

had been described as an "Old Soviet worker") was closely associated

with Verdamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN, an alleged Soviot agent at

the IRO Camp at Sanar, P. I.

As reported above, Mrse KAMKIN' s

sister Mna and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacuated to Samar,

P. I., fron shanghat under INO auspices in April 1949.

Vendand Vasillevitch SAPELKIN's friend URLOFF, according to

a report of 8 April 1950, was alleged to have influenced a district

loader of the IRO Camp at Samar with pro-Soviet propagancia, and to

have worked with a number of other pro-soviet internees in the cam

to Sovietize the Russian refugees interned there. According to a

report dated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was believed to be a

Soviot agent. (The report noted that this information originated

in the IRO Camp in Samar; that much information originating there

had proven unreliable; and that the reliability of this particular

Intormation had not been determinedo)

However this may be, it appears that there could be much truth

in the allegations.

Information in Sacurity filos rerlects that

ORLOFF very possibly is Identical with a "Count ORLOFF of the

Russian Cormittee", (apparently a committoo of Iio), Who assistod

the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation In securinz

IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in

Paria who was living with and was engaged to marry KirIl VASSILEV,

who was belleved to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligenco

Servico.

"Count ORIOFF"

also helped arrange OTTAIls entranco into

the Unitod States.

Alexander S.

A Dacembar 1954 Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported

that unevaluated Information dated 1 June 1948 indicated that one

Victor N. KAMKIN was Involved in a money printing transaction with

the Japanese, In which he used the machinery of the Chihli Press

in Tientsin to facilitate the countorfitting.

The source of this

information had pointed out the possibility that Victor No KAMKIN

might be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was named

as a charactor reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF.

(IVASHKOFF

The memorandun advised that according to a

report dated 1 June 1948 from a U. S. Naval. Attache, Nanking, to

the American Ambassador, Nankings

V. No KAMKIN was a printer

publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge

Publishing House, known as Nashe ZNANIE. He was closely associated

with Bernard S. HOGARD of the Chihli Press, who in turn was

associated with alleged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN.

According to the Staff C memorandum, a report from the FBI

datod ll August 1953 indicated that a source of unknown reliability

statod that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a

possible cover in Tientsin, China, acted as a paid informer of

the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid informer of U. S.

Army Intelligence aftor the War.

With the assistance of the

American Military Goverrment in Tsingtao, China,

he became Chairman

of the Russian Immigrant Society In Tsingtao In 1948. There seems

small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor No

and with Subject, Victor P. KAIKIN who was fomarly head

of the Russian Immigrant

Association in Tsingtao, China, accord-

ing to his friend SAPELKIN,

as reported in Hong Kong Mispatc

#402. Note that Victor N. KAMKIN was in charge of & Russian

Publishing House in China known as Nashe Znante; and that the
