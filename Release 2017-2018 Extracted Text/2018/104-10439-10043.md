SUBJECT: KAMHIN, Victor Petrovich
Al~2752 - SSD-90097

A review of Subject's file has been made in connection with
a request from the CI Officer, French Desk, with reference to
information from the(Chief of Station, Paris,) that Subject's Washington
book store, as of the summer of 1959, was one of the four book stores

Ke in the United States where subscriptions could be bought for "RODINA",
GF, the bulletin odited by the Repatriation Committee of East Berlin.
fe "RODINA'! (LA PATRIE), which is distributed in various languages
K and is idited in sealed envelopes, has been forbidden distribution *

in France. (See attached thernofax.)

Security files reflect that in April 1957 the FBI advised that
Victor Petrovich KAMKIN, Elena Ancreevna KAMKIN and Nina SAPELKIN
had been the subjects of an Internal Security - R type investigation
as of 1951 and thatr "There is no derogatory data of a subversive
nature in the files of this Bureau concerning the subject of your
inquiry (KAMKIN). It should be noted, however, that Victor
Petrovich KAMKIN is currently of investigative interest to this
Buroeu and, accordingly, it is requested that any contact of hin
in behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency be handled by this
bureau." It was advised orally that the Bureau was ueing KAMKIN
ag a BuUrces .

Mas. Sarentin hecording to an undated blind memorandum (possibly a Staff C
Arbo Lived visting memorantiom), Nina SAPELKIN is Elena KAMKIN's sister and ag of

ins J+ 195) was living with the KAMKINs in Tennesses. Nins SAPELKIN was
born in Russia 18 August 1912; and wes evacuated from Shanghai to
Sanar, Philippins Islands under IRO auspices in April 1919,
accompanied by her husband Semen I, SAPELKIN and their two children.
Sag caxe to the United States in 1951 and lived in Tennessee for

a time with the KAMKINs. The SAPELKINs reportedly renounced

Soviet citizenship in Shanghai in September or Octobor 19)8.

The KAMKINe also were born in Russia and KAMKIN attendsd
high school and university in Harbin, Menchuria. Thereafter until
19h$ he was in the printing and publishing business in China; and
during 19h6-k7 says he wae with "Special Services, Section Il,
Amph., Marine Corps", working on its newspaper, "North China
Marine", In 19h7 he was co-publisher of "Free Word" vhich he says
was an anti-Soviet newspaper closed by pressure of the Soviet

Conrulate. From 19h? to 19h9 he stated that, he was the owner of
the "Anchor Printing Shop" in which the "North China Marine"
contimsed publication in Tsingtao, China. The XAMKINs came to
the United States in 19L9 arriving in San Francisco in arch.

As of 1957 KAMKIN was being used on en unclassified basis by
the CIA Library asa publications procurement channel, It is, of
course, possible that Subject's interest in "RODINA"Y is on behalf

of this Agency.

‘The other book stores involved in the report to the French
Desk were the well known Communist "Four Continents Book Store",
(MS-2000), "Imported Publications and Products" (MS-2001-I} and
"Universal Distributors Company” (#91916). These organizations are
registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Four 5
Continents Book Store ie flagrantly Communist¢needs no defining; a
and the "Inported Publications and Products" is reported to be 2
one of the four principal outlets for Conmnist political prop-
agenda in the United States. "Universal Distributors Company" is
described as "an officiel distributor of Communist Party Literature”
and as "Cormnist controlled". It is the distributing agency for
the Four Continents Book Store.

Information from a reliable confidential informant reflects
thet during the summer of 1959 KAMKIN indicated he plannad to
opon a branch book store in San Francisco to be operated by 5.
SAPHIKIN, The store was to be called Znanie, Russian Book Store,
and located at 5237 Geary Street, San Francisco. Thie S. SAPELKIN,
in all probability, is Mrs. KAMKIN's brother-in-law Semen I. C
SAPELKIN, MS-S000, who with his wife Nina, nee DAVIDOVA, aka
DAVIDOF, was the subject of an FBI Record Check Request in Mey
1955. (the wife Nina, per the check shvet, resided at Routs
1, Van Leer, Tennessee from 1951 to 1952, which was the KAMKIN's
address during this period.)

The 1955 FBI Record Check Request on SAPELKIN indicated that
he was formerly a painter; that his wife Nina was a dentists that
both were born in Russia; that he arrived in the United States
fron France around the end of 1954, wes stateless and had his first
papers and that she arrived in San Francisco 5 June 1951. They
were residing at 1405 Harvard Street, NeWe, Washington, D. Co
(which was the address of Subject's book store); and had formerly
resided in Tientsin and Shanghai, China. Both their children
were born in Mentsin, one in 19f6 and one in 1919.

An RI check requested in 1957 for USIA indiceted that the name
Semon I, SAPLKIN appeared in a report frem a reliable source in
May 1950, which dealt with refugees in an IRO camp at Guinan,

Samar, Philippine Islands; and, according to the report, he had
been a member of the Russian Residents Association (probably Russian

An ONI name check on KAMKIN, in November 1954, reflacted the

cross-referencing of his name to "Foreign Service Dispatch, Hong Kong

#402, 22: August 1952", the subject of which was "Contact of Mr.

Acohe QTLs Subject's friend "Mr. SAPRLKIN" may well be Mr. Verdemin
Bey has Vacilievitch SAPELKIN, the Subject of Hong Kong Dispatch, #102,
‘ween obtained a who in all probability is related to Mrs. KAMKIN's brother-in-law,
yerencetee. Semen I. SAPZLKIN.
Nad ineividuas>
Mrs According to a 1955 RI check conducted on one Alexander Se
Hee ORLOFF for G-2, a report of 17 May 1950 advised that ORLOFF (tho
“flad been described as an "Old Soviet worker") was closely associated
—<" with Veniamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN, an alleged Soviet agent at
the IRO Camp at Samar, P. I. As reported above, Mrs. KAMKIN's
: sister Nina and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacuated to Samar,
a P. I., from Shanghed under JRO auspices in April 1949.

i Veniamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN's friend ORIOFF, according to
a report of 8 April 1950, was alleged to have influenced a district
leader of the IRO Camp at Samar with pro-Soviet propaganda, and to
have worked with a mumber of other pro-Soviet internees in the camp
to Sovietize the Russian refugees interned theres According to a
report cated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was believed to be a

. Soviet agent. (The report noted that this information originated
3 in the IRO Camp in Samar; that much information originating there

3 had proven unreliable; and that the reliability of this particular
ot information had not been determined.)

However this may be, it appears that thers could be much truth
in the allegations. Information in Security filos reflects that
ORLOFF very possibly is identical with a "Count ORIOFF of the
Russian Committee", (apparently a committee of THO);“uho assisted
tha Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing
IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in
Paris who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSILEV,
who was believed to ba an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence
Service. "Count ORLOFF* also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into
the United States. Aloxander S. ORIOFF and "Count ORIOFF" may well
be identical with Alexander ORLOFF, DL-2881, a highly suspect
individual of Russian birth, and a former AM'CRG employee who was
security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter individual, per
a 19)3 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count",

A Dacember 1954 Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported
that unevgluated information dated 1 June 1948 indicated that ons
Victor N./KAMKIN was involved in a money printing transaction with
tha’Japardse, in which he used the machinery of the Chihli Press
in Tientsin to facilitate the counterfitting. The source of this
information had pointed out the possibility that Victor N. KAMKIN
might be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was named
as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKOFF
was net identified.) ‘The memorandum advised that according to a
report dated 1 June 1948 from a U. S. Naval. Attache, Nanking, to
the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. Ne KAMKIN was a printer and
publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian
Publishing House) known as Nashe ZNANIE. He was closely associated
with Bernard S./ROGARD of the Chihli Press, who.in turn was
associated with | \alleged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN.

According to the Staff G memorandum , a report from the FBI
dated ly August 1953 indicated that a source of unknown reliability
eteated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a
possible cover in Tientsin, China, acted as a paid informer of
the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid informer of Us Se
Arny Intelligence after the War. With the assistance of the
American Military Government in Tsingtao, China, he became Chairman
of the Russian Immigrant Society in Tsingtao in 198. There seems
small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor No
KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head
of the Russian Immigrant Association in Tsingtao, China, accord~
ing to his friend SAPELKIN, as. reported in Hong Kong Dispatch
#02. Note that Victor N. KAMKIN was in charge of a Russian
Publishing House in China known as Nashe Znanies and that the
branch store Subject: intended to open in San Francisco (and may
have opened) was also to be called Znanie (this work in Russian
means "Knowledge")s
