Cuban le September 4, 1962, issue of t fb Juan Star,

--a daily English language newspaper, carried an article
entitled "Cuban Exiles to Meet Here," dateline, Ponce,
Puerto Rigo, which indicated that a new organization headed
“py MANOL Y, a Cuban exile leader, residing and working
in San Judn, Puerto Rico, was to be formed at meetings .
to be held on September’ 15 - 16, 1962, at Juana Diaz and
Ponce, Puerto Rico. It.was indicated that the meeting on
September 15, 1962, at Juana Diaz would be secret and the
meeting on September 16, 1962, at Ponce, Puerto Rico,
would be public. The name of this new organization was
to be the Junta Revolucionaria. Cubana (Cuban Revolutionary
Board)(JURE). It was further indicated that about 113 Cubans
were expected to attend these meetings and that they would
come from New York, Miami, Chicago, Venezuela, Costa Rica, ;
Panama, and the remainder from Puerto Rico. :

On September 4, 1962, SJ T-1, a Cuban exile residing :
in Puerto Rico, who is well acquainted in the Cuban colony i
here, advised that the above-article was a result of the
efforts of MANOLO RAY, formerly a Cuban exile leader, who was i
using the présent crises concerning Cuba being supplied with }
Soviet arms in an attémpt~to-regain the political prestige
he once held among the Cuban exiles. None of the Cuban exile
leaders are expected to attend this meeting as they have no
confidence in MANOLO:RAY or his ideas concerning Cuba. ZU

On September 4, 1962, SJ T-2, who is a leading Cuban

exile leader, residing in Puerto Rico, furnished essentially
the same information as SJ T-1, and in addition, stated he
had been asked to attend the above-described meeting but had _
declined. He heard that possibly a few Cuban exiles planned
to attend this meeting but the 113 Cubans mentioned’in the
article as the number expected to attend, was strictly a

/ propaganda statement by MANOLO RAY and designed to add an
atmosphere of urgency and importance to the meeting. SJ T-2 4
stated that Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico placed no confidence :
