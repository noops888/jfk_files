MANLEL

The September 4, 1962, Issue of the San Juan Star,

a daily English language newspaper, carried an article

entitled "Cuban Exiles to Meet Here,"

dateline, Ponce,

Puerto Rico, which indicated that a new organization headed

BY

DECIASSIFIED

"by MANOLO RAY, a Cuban exile leader, residing and working

in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was to be formed at meetings

to be held on September 15 - 16, 1962, at Juana Diaz and

Ponce, Puerto Rico.

It was indicated

that the meeting on

September 15, 1962, at Juana Diaz would be secret and the

meeting on September 16, 1962, at Ponce, Puerto Rico,

would be public.

The name of this new organization was

to be the Junta

Revolucionaria Cubana (Cuban Revolutionary

Board) (JURE ).

It was further indicated that about 113 Cubans

were expected to attend these meetings and that they would

come from New York, Miami, Chicago, Venezuela, Costa Rica,

Panama, and the remainder from Puerto Rico. U

On September 4, 1962, SJ T-I, a Cuban exile residing

in Puerto Rico, who is well acquainted in the Cuban colony

here, advised that the above article was a result of the

efforts of MANOLO RAY, formerly a Cuban exile leader, who was

using the present crises concerning Cuba being supplied with

Soviet arms in an attempt to regain the political prestige

he once held among the Cuban exiles. None of the Cuban exile

leaders are expected to attend this meeting as they have no

confidence in MANOLO RAY or his ideas concerning Cuba.u

On September 4, 1962, SJ T-2, who is a leading Cuban

exile leader, residing in Puerto Rico, furnished essentialy

the same information as SJ I-1, and in addition,

stated he

had been asked to attend the above-described meeting but had

OAD

declined. He heard that possibly a few Cuban exiles planned

to attend this meeting but the 113 Cubans mentioned in the

8-13:84

Classied by g

article as the number expected to attend, was strictly a

propaganda statement by MANOLO RAY and designed to

add an

atmosphere of urgency and importance to the meeting. SJ T-2

stated that Cuban exilés in Puerto Rico placed no confidence

in the statements made by MANOLO RAY, especially concerning
