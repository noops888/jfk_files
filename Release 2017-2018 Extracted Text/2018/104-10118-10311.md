/s/ Winston L. Scott

Although this employee is a fine Intelligence officer end has worked

very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the reting

of Outstanding in all specific duties and for over-all performence to be

excessively high. Reporting on the ectivities she supervises has been

as good as that from other Mexico City operations but is still not up

to DDP standerds. While most of the projects she is concerned with are

handled with proper cost consciousness, at least one of them, the LITEMPO

Project, is not.

The agents are paid too much and their sctivities are

not adequately reported. This has been called to the station's ettention.

Miss Goodpasture has been

medical retirement in October

She is a charter member of the Agency,l

having entered on duty from OSS and its successor organizations.

career is highly distinguished by virtue of consistently strong to out-

standing performance, all of which is fully documented.

In addition to several staff and desk assignments, Miss Goodpasture

served in support of the successful coup against the communist government

in Guatemala in 1954 and completed tours of duty in

Monterrey and

Mexico City.

Undoubtedly, the high point of her career occurred

her service

in Mexico City from 1957 through 1970, where

she served as a

"trouble-shooting"

case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott

(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station.

Mr. Scott, a stern task-

master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as

"intelligent, hard-

working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the

most competent CI/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."

Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with

this

appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings.

In her final

assignment prior to acute medical problems,

she worked for the CI Staff

(October 1970-Oetober 1971),

earning the

supervisor:

following

remarks from her

to rate her overall

as Outstanding.

this organization

contribution to the Clandestine Service.

By virtue of unusual dedication to duty which over a

period of several years, included consistently

long hours,

superior performance and tangible achievement in sensitive

matters of national security, Miss

Goodpasture has excelled

as an operations officer.

She was

the case officer who was

responsible for the identification of Lee Harvey Oswald

in his dealings with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

She was

also responsible for other important and successful opera-

tions against Soviet penetration efforts directed toward

the United States from Mexico.

She would rather work than

rest, and when she works, she

always impresses her super-

iors

with her mastery over her craft.

thirty years

Miss Goodpasture has given unstintingly of herself to

the cause and mission of this Agency; the Agency owes her

formal acknowledgement of appreciation.
