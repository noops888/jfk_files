BURMESE GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH

SAW HUNTER AND THE MORE MODERATE INSURGENTS. IF THESE

TALKS FAIL, GENERAL NE WIN WILL EE FACED WITH AN

INSURGENT THREAT WHICH HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY.

WITH ALL US AID. THIS DECISION FOLLOWED A LONG

INTERROGATION OF TWO MEMBERS OF THE KHMER SEREI

ACTIVITIES AND BROADCASTS. IN FACT THEIR

ANSWERS SEEM TO SHOW NO. MORE THAN THAT US ARMS AND

EQUIPMENT ARE PLENTIFUL IN SOUTH VIETNAM, THAT THE

KHMER SEREI HAD RECEIVED AMERICAN ASSISTANCE TO FIGHT

THE VIET CONG AND ALSO AMERICAN RADIO APPARATUS.
