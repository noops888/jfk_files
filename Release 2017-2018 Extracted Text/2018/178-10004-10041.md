RE: DEPOSITION OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR W. RAYMOND WANNALL

advised of the contents of the letter which authorized

Mr. Wannall to discuss and provide deposition, as requested,

in executive (closed) session matters concerning the Watch

List formally maintained by NSA at the request of the FBI.

The letter stated further that concerning open sessions of

the Senate Select Committee, Mr. Wannall was advised that

NSA and Senate Select Committee representatives would

commence negotiations on October 4, 1975, to define limits

within which Special Intelligence information may be disclosed

in open session and pending establishment of such limits,

FBI personnel were requested not to discuss Special Intelli-

gence matters in such open sessions.

Mr. James Dick of the Committee Staff was the

principal interviewer. The following represents to the

best of Ir. Wannall's recollection the infornation furnished

by him responsive to specific questions. Material is not

necessarily set forth in the order in which the questions

vere asked and the responses given.

Mr. Wannall was first exposed to NSA-type material

when he arrived at Readquarters for assignment in 1947.

This

material had been produced by a predecessor agency to the

National Security Agency. He became aware of some of the

overall capabilities of the NsA probably sometime during

the late 1950'g.

He was shown copies of three FBI internal memoranda

addressed fron W. R. Wannall to W. C. Sullivan (at that

time Assistant Director of the Donestic Intelligence Division

of the FBI) captioned "Communications Intelligence - Cuba,"

and dated respectively May 18, 1962, January 16, 1963, and

April 6, 1965.

Section of which he was Chief during this period, he had

some personal knowledge in this area. With respect to

Watch List matters in other areas of interest to the FBI,

his knowledge for the most part was based on a review of

material and information provided to him orally by current

personnel of the Intelligence Division principally during

the preceding 24 hours. In this connection, he explained

that he had learned at about 5:30 p.u. the preceding day,

October 2, 1975, that

his deposition testimony would be

expected to relate either mainly or exclusively to Watch

List matters.

The memoranda described above related to meetings

held in Wannall's office in May, 1962, and January, 1963,

at which representatives of NSA and representatives of

Fannall'g former Section were present. The discussions

centered about the means whereby NBA could be most helpful

to the FBI in processing some 20,000 messages received

each month in NSA's coverage of Cuban natters.

personal communications between Cube and the United States.

The three nemoranda showed that a procedure was

worked out whereby the FBI could subuit approximately

300 nanes and addresses to NSA for the purpose of securing

Information relating to FBI responsibilities.

Itr. Wannall was asked whether any criteria were

established for the purpose of compiling the list of some

300 names. He responded in the affirmative and described

the criteria prior to being shown the menorandun of April 6,

1965, wherein the criteria vere not forth they consisted

Mr. Dick referring to two other programs involving

procedures were not followed in submission of names to NSA

and asked why this was-so. He was advised that matters

relating to the Watch List were handled on & need-to-know

in other Sections would not necessarily be the same as

In response to questioning, Mr. Wannall stated

that he could not recall any instances wherein names

regarding the Cuban Watch Ligt were submitted orally to

NSA, but it was possible that this way have been done in

SOMe CaSeS. He was not able to comment on the volume of

material received from NSA in connection with the Cuban

Watch List since the product went directly to the desks

of the supervisors handling Cuban matters within his

Government.

In explaining this comment, it was pointed

out that the U.S. Goverment had entablished a list of

restricted items which could not be sent to Cuba without

an export license and material of this nature would have

been of value to the YBI to establish identities of firms

which might be contravening the provisions of regulations

so adopted and administered by the Department of Commerce.

It was pointed out that to Mr. Wannall's knowledge no

to the possibility of furnishing to NSA a llating of

This general briefing was not a briefing relating

fact that his awareness regarding both the New Left Watch

List and another Watch List relating to racial matters

had come principally from reviews of material and briefings

by Intelligence Division personnel within the preceding

24-hour period.

Mr. Wannall was shown a copy of a letter

originating with NSA which contained a code word utilized

in connection with the New Left Watch List and was asked

11 he had ever heard the code name. He replied that he

had heard it and estimated that it was some several months

to a year or more after the New Left Watch List briefing

in the Fall of 1969 which has been referred to above.

Mr. Bll1ff inguired an to the rules utilized

He was advised that the field was told the information

the purpose of recovering such information.

In response,

the operation of the FBI's Electronic Surveillance Index

was explained and it was pointed out that this index was

not utilized as a Watch List.

It was further explained

that there is no computerization of such information.

In response to a specific request, the Staff Members were

advised that the material received from NSA as a result

of the so-called Watch Lists had not been computerized.

Mr. Wannall was shown a copy of a letter

addressed to the Director of NIA dated June 3, 1970,

from which the subject had been excised with a notation

that it was & code word for one of the Watch Lists,

identified in a note on the yellow file copy as the

Watch List relating to new left matters. In the letter

the Director of NSA was informed that the FBI had a

Mr. Wannall

explained that fron his review of mterial, he had

established that this letter apparently had been written

in response to & request from NSA that the FBI indicate

1f it did, in fact, have & contiming interest in

receiving such information. At this point, a copy of

Mr. Dick then exhibited & copy of a teletype

dated December 24, 1970, which had been sent by the FBI

to NSA concerning an individual named Grover C. HeArthur•

In the body of the teletype, it was indicated that

CArthur, & student at the University of Pennsylvania,

(BPP) and its international operations and was scheduled

to leave the United States two days later for Algiers,

Algeria, where an office of the BPP was located. Asked

why the name of a student writing a papar on such a

stated that he had no knowledge in connection with this

RE: DEPOSITION OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR W. RAYHOND WANNALL

Mr. Wannall was specifically asked whether

names were placed on any of the so-called Watch Lists

orally.

He advised that based on discussions he had

had with Intelligence Division personnel, it was his

understanding that some names were placed on some of the

lists orally, but that he was unable to say how many and

would estimate that the percentago was small. He was

asked 1f he had any information indicating that set

procedures were established with respect to the Watch

Lists relating to new left and racial matters. He said

he had been advised that a card file had been maintained

as an administrative aid in order that the identities

of individuals and organizations on & latch List would

be readily available. This card file was maintained on

a temporary basts and cards were destroyed upon the

removal of the names of individuals and organizations

on the list. There was no central repository in Bureau

files for the names on the lists.

On s recurring basis,

NSA would furnish Watch List print-outs which were

circularized in order that a review could be made to

assure that the list was up to date. It was pointed

out by Mr. Wannall that he could not estimate how often

these lists were received fron NBA and circularized,

although he felt that it was probably nore frequently

Mr. Dick posed a question as to whether

any names had been placed on the Hatch Lists for foreign

intelligence agencies and ir. Wannall replied in the

negative.

Mr. Dick then exhibited a copy of a letter

March 22, 1771, in which a request was mnde for any

further indicated that in addition to baing of interest

to the foreign intelligence service, the individuals were

also of interest to the FBI in view of existing, clone

relationships between Black extrenist activities in the

United States and a foreign country. Ir. Wannall pointed

out that his previous negative reply should probably have

on any of the persons listed on the enclosure and (2) if so,

whether such information had been furnished to the foreign

intelligence service.

Another letter exhibited was one dated June 8,

1971, from the FBI to the Director of NSA captioned "Black

ho veng to

Nationalist Movement, Racial Matters." This letter

referred to sone names, addresses, and, in some instances,

telephone numbers which had been previously forwarded to

NSA by communication dated June 4, 1971, and requested

any pertinent information which SA might possess or

might have cone to its attention concerning the individuals.

The June 8, 1971, letter also had a note on the yellow

in which it was stated that the list of names sent to NSA

June 4, 1971, included suspects in the NIVKIll case and

relatives and associates of suspects, as well as BPP

members.

In response to questions, Mr. "annall explained

what that case was and how the Bureau was called upon to

undertake investigation. Since the case involved the

killing of Hew York City Police Departuent officers in

about May, 1971, Mr. Dick conmented upon the possible use

of NSA-produced

information in a criminal investigation.

He was advised that Ir. Wannall had no knowledge as to

whether or not NSA provided any information which was

so used in this particular matter.

Beferring to previous information to the effect

that Mr. Wannall was aware in the late 1950's of certain

NSA operations, Mr. Dick inquired as to whether NSA was

supplying Information to the YBI before the institution

of the Watch Lists.

The reply was affirmative.

He asked

11 such information included material on United States

citizens. While Mr. Wannall could not recall specifics

in this regard, he expressed the opinion that material

on U.s, citizens was provided in the lata 1950'g and

prior to the institution of the Watch Lists procedures.

Mr. Dick mentioned & specific name of apparent French

derivation which was not recognized by Mr. Wannall.

Inquiry was made as to whether former Director

not considered as being derived fron electronic surveillance

He was advised that sgain what was in the writer's

mind could not be interpreted but that Mr. Wannall could

cite a personal experience which might have & bearing on

his question. Several years ago in a situation concerning

which the circumstances and reasons could not be recalled,

Mr. Wannall was desirous of astablishing the source of

In this regard, utilizing the procedures which were

outlined in the Attorney General's letter of October 1,

1973. Ir. Illiff was reminded of the parameters of the

interview and the scope of release issued by NIA to

Ar. Wannall to permit the latter to be deposed. Mr. Ell1ff

said that since

Watch Lists matters were involved, he

wanted to pursue this and accordingly returning to on-the

record interview, Mr. Dick asked whether since the October 1,

1973, letter from the Attorney General the Bureau had

utilized the procedure of seeking the Attorney General's

approval to obtain solely foreign intelligence or counter

espionage information fron NHA. The reply vas negative.

The question was propounded as to whether at the present

time the YBI levies requests upon NSA. Ir. Wannall

responded that at the present time the FBI does not

request NSA to add to 1ts electronic searching capability

any names of itens of interest to IBI investigations.

The FBI, however, has requested to be placed on NSA's

general distribution list for cortain itens of information

which that gency develops by its foreign coverage in the

course of servicing requests received from the USIB or

other U.S. Government agencies.

Kr. Elliff then asked whether the Bureau as

& member of the USIB made any input with respect to the

overall United States Goverment intelligence requirements.

He was advised that analysts prepare papers relating to

such input which papers are passed upon by the Board

and that the fBI has no analysts who participate in the

preparation of such papers.

Besponding to a question, Mr. Wannall pointed

out that the Bureau does presently receive mterial from

NSA and has had discussions with NSA to nake that agency

aware of the YBI's foretgn counterintelligence interests.

Mr. B1l111 asked 1f the Attorney General was aware of this.

He was advised that Mr. Hannall recalled attending a

briefing in the Attorney General's Office within the

past six nonths, which briefing was conducted by repre-

sentatives of NSA. During the briefing the Attorney

General became aware of certain areas of FBI interests

with respect to NSA functions.
