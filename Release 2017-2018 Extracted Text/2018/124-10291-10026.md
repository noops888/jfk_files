MM T--l1 advised that on November 14, 1964, Coli-
onel Valdivia left Miami without notifying.individuals
with whom he was in close contact. He arrived back in
Miami from New York on November 24, 1964. Upon his re-
turn, he immediately contacted Dr. Sanchez, inasmuch as
Sanchez was to introduce him to some individual of im-
portance. ra u)

Early in December, 1964, Colonel Valdivia
informed MM T-1 that he had had no further contact with
his superior in Haitian matters; and that he had nothing
to suggest to further the Haitian movement. It appeared
to source that Colonel Valdivia had changed after his
trip to New York. He also changed, possibly, because he
had been interviewed by U. S. Customs Service and U. S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) at Miami.
MM T-1, at that time, did not expect any new activity on
the part of ICD, or individually ‘on the part of Dr. San-
chez or Colonel Valdivia, Antoniq Paz, or others, in view
of the recent developments. Kew)

On December 6, 1964, Dr. Sanchez informed MM T~1

he had no new information concerning the Haitian affair.
Dr. Sanchez mentioned that efforts were being niade to ob-
tain some help from possible sources, but no specific
mention was made as to any possible source. a

MM T-1, on December 23, 1964, advised that he
knew of no activity on the part of Dr. Sanchez, Colonel
Valdivia, Antonio Paz, or Jose Antonio, Maceo. As to
