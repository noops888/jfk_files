1. “Although Subject submitted a good number of. reports
which were.of interest to JMWAVE internally, only three dis-
seminations, were credited to him during the month:

as UFG-2781 (cable) from Frank Fiorini and Pepin Bosch,”
"Frank Fiorini's Agreement to Participate in Air Strike
Against Cuba". fn oe

b. .UFG-2901 (cable) from Frank Fiorini, "Request by
Venezuelan National that Frank Fiorini: Purchase Arms

for Him".
: _
c. UFG-2922 (cable) from Pedro Martinez Fraga,
"Possible Cooperation Between Manuel A. de Varona and “S >
Manuel ‘Artime". —_—Tt

2. One item of information which Subject received from |
Frank Fiorini.on\28 May was considered possibly oftinterest to
Headquarters, but probably bast not forwarded in reports Format.
Fiorini said that he had spoken twice during the month with
General Claré Chenault, Jr., who phoned from California.
Chenault indicated his desire to participate in the anti-
Castro effort, and asked Fiorini about the different organ—
izations in the Miami area and their leaders. Fiorini's
reply put Manuel Artime at the head of the list, and noted }

that lack of. finanaial~backing was Artime's most pressing
problem. In. the second phone call, Chenault recommended that
Artime solicit aid from the representatives of the Chinese
Nationalists in Washington, and urged that nis (Chenault's)
name be used. Fiorini promised to pass this on to Artime
when the latter returned to the U.S. from a tour of Latin
American countries.

3, Information on a possible new labor grouping in exile
called Alianza de Trabajadores Cubanos was received from Sub-~
ject early in the month, and was forwarded as an attachment .

to UFGA-8970. Sore e

IV. Futuré: Plans

Subject will continue his rounds of the exi:
in general, but will also look for more covert sources of
information such as jevelopment. ii¢ will also
be useful for debriefing of new arrivals fro Cuba who are
connected with revolutionary groups of interest to JMWAVE.
In this regard he should be of considerable assistance in
the influx of Uruguayan asylees.
