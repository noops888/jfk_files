Frank Fiorini on 28 May was considered.

possibly of interest to

Headquarters, but probably best not forwarded in reports

Fiorini said

that he had spoken twice during the month with

General Clare Chenault, Jr,, who phoned from California.

Chenault indicated his

desire to participate in the anti-

Castro effort, and asked Fiorini

about the different organ-

problem.

In the second phone call, Chenault recommended

Artime solicit aid from the representatives of the Chinese

Nationalists in Washington,

and urged that nis (Chenault's)

name be used.

Fiorini promised to pass this on to Artime
