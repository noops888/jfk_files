According to T-30 who advised on February 10,
1959, that he had just returned to Cuba from Miami, had
ascertained while in Miami that .a number of well respected
banking individuals in Miami, including two members of the
First National Bank, were interested in. buying up all the
Cuban money that they could at a price of 60¢ on the
dollar. Informant stated that MEYER LANSKY was attempting
to dispose of a substantial amount of Cuban currency.

A week later, the informant advised that thes
gambling element in Havana had received indications that
LANSKY would not be allowed to return to Havana by the
CASTRO Government.

\ The same informant stated on February 18,
1959, that he had heard that after the asdination of ALBERT
ANASTASIA, a meeting of local Mafia members was called to
discuss the allotment and control of gambling rights in the
South Florida-Cuba area. The informant stated this meeting
took place somewhere on the Florida Keys about ten days.
to two weeks before the meeting at Apalachin, New York, on
November 14, 1957. aa i

Informant continued by stating that after an
agreement. had been reached at the Florida meeting, the
meeting in Apalachin.was held with the principal item on
the agenda being consideration of the agreement reached at
the local meeting on the Florida Keys. Informant noted
that JOSEPH SILESI, New York top hoodlum, and SANTO
TRAFFICANTE, Miami top hoodlum, were present at. the
meeting in Apalachin, New York. Informant further noted that
the group at Apalachin had to ccnsider Cuban gambling and
narcotics jointly, becausé the casinos, while potentially
lucrative in themselves, are additionaly far more important
as fronts for narcotic transactions of large size.

Prostitut:

Prostitution flourishes in New York despite
periG@ic drives. by vice officers to stamp it out.
Prostitutes working in New York may be classified as street
walkers, call girls,house girls’and-bar hustlers.

Street walkers operate daily between 9:00 p.m.
and 4:00 a.m., on Manhattan's west side, particularly between
hand and 59th Streets. These girls are predominantly colored
prostitutes who, for financial reasons, prefer white men but
are not permitted to mingle in bars catering to a white
clientele, A white street walker, who lives among Negroes and
is source of this office, is well acquainted with a number of
street walkers and their pimps. Through her efrts many of
the street walkers and their pimps have been identified and,
where there were indications of interstate transportation,
appropriate investigation has been conducted, It is not
unusual on any evening to observe colored pimps drive their
girls to the area around Central Park South and Seventh avenue,
whee the prostitutes alight from the late model Cadillses
to begin their evening's work, The average price is around
$35.00 - $50.00 and the john is expected to provide a room,
Unless the prostitute mistakenly approaches a vice patrolman
and accompanies him to a room, an arrest of a street walker
is difficult since most of them are adept at spotting a
surveilling officer.

Dotted throughout New York are a number of
houses of prostitution which consist of a one or two-bedroom
apartment with a madam and one or two girls. On the west side
of New York this type of operation abounds in the Seventies
and Eighties, where the average price is $10.00 - $15.00. On
the east side this same type of operation exists, also in the
Seventies and Eighties, but the surroundings are better and
the fees are usually between $25.00 - $50.00.

Sources of this office, who operate in this
eategory, have advised that there are no organized vice rings
supplying girls to these houses and that. each house is strictly
an individual operation. This is supported by the fact that

NEW YORK CITY FUR MARKET

The New York City Fur Market is concentrated
in mid Manhattan in about 12 square blocks from West
27th Street to West 3lst Street, between Broadway
and Sth Avenue. Virtually every buildingin this
area is completely devoted to the housing of some
phase of the fur endustry. According to reliable
sources About 90% of all fur garment manufacturing
in the United States is confined to the New York market.
Further New York City is considered the fur marketing
center of the world. Raw and dressed fur skins of all Gescriptias
are imported to New York City from all parts of the world
and sold at auction by two principal auction houses,
The New York Fur Auction Company and The Hudson Bay
Company.

Subsequent to purchase by manufacturers,
skins are made ante ani sty of garments and sold

largely through jobbers to retail outlets. Most
mnaufacturers also are jobbers. In this regard it is to
be noted that almost all retailers of fur garments depend
on an army of Resident Buyers who act as Brokers

between manufacturers, jobbers and retailers.

Te Be who has more than 20
years experience Th Alew York Fur Market has advised
that there are about 2,000 manufacturers in the New
York Market representing about 90 per cent of all
manufacturers in the United States with' principal
competition in Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
These New York manufacturers constitute the nucleus
