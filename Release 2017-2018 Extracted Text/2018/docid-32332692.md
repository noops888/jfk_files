Prostitution

Prostitution flourishes in New York despite

perlouie arives. by vice officers to stamp it out

rostitutes working in New York mav be classified as street

walkers, call girls, house girls and bar hustlers.

Street walkers operate daily between 9:00 p.m.

and 4:00 a.m., on Manhattan's west side, particularly between

prostitutes who, for financial reasons, prefer white men but

not so i in

Streets.

These girls are predominantly colored

are not permitted to mingle in bars catering to a white

clientele.

A white street walker, who lives among Negroes and

is source of this office, is well acquainted with a number of

street walkers and their pimps. Through her efforts many of

the street walkers and their pimps have been identified and,

waters and their pimp?

where there were indications of interstate transportation,

appropriate investigation has been conducted. It is not

unusual on any evening to observe colored pimps drive their

girls to the area around Central Park South and Seventh Avenue,

where the prostitutes alight from the late model Cadillacs

to begin their evening's work.

The average price is around

$35.00 - $50.00 and the john is expected to provide a rcom..

Unless the prostitute mistakenly approaches a vice patrolman

and accompanies him to a room, an arrest of a street walker

is difficult since most of them are adept at spotting a

surveilling officer.

Dotted throughout New York are a number of

houses

of prostitution which consist of a one or two-bedroom

apartment with a madam and one or two girls.

On the west side

of New York this type of operation abounds in the Seventies

and Eighties,

where the average price is $10.00 - $15.00.

On

the east side this same type of operation exists, also in the

Seventies and Eighties, but the surroundings are

the fees are usually between $25.00 - $50.00.

Sources of this office, who operate in this

category, have advised that there are no organized vice rings

supplying girls to these houses and that each house is strictly

an individual operation. This is supported by the fact that

phase of the fur industry. According to reliable

sources about 90% of all fur garment manufacturing

largely through jobbers to retail outlets.

Most

mnaufacturers also are jobbers.

be noted that almost all retailers of fur garments depend

on an army of Resident Buyers who act as Brokers
