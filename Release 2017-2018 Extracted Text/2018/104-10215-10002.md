It 18 recommended that the ebove information be evaluated by the
field station vhen the independent field survey of project HUMANOID is
undertaken. Portinent oaments should be made regarding the significance
of this information from a security viewpoint.

11. In cumery, it is recomended that HUMANOID exercise extrens caution
in all of his intelligence activities. Although there is no clearly defined
security roblem ‘nvolved, paragraphs 9 and 10, above, suggest areas of
possible danger.
