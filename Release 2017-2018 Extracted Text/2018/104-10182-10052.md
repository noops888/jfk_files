A. DIR 25730

B. ACLA. 630 dated 19 Ootober. 1961

1. On 29 November 1961 MIROSUS töld the undersigned that he folt his

position vig-a-vts

the Congolese Government way rapidly weakening.

First:

wRoGue had endorsed sending one o. the advisors with the congolese Alr

Force to furope to puronase planes and later lound WIüdru/4 was at least

cognizant of a second GOS rapresentative

to surope on the sane mission.

WIth made vague references io some 2, 000,000 Congolese Frince of the

"going. into soneone'a.pocket."

'INOGJE waa incensed'at the move of the doc in sending a parallel mias1or

to Furope and not informing him of it.

He saw WIZARD/2 and asked about

this otber mission:

WIZARD/2 apparently Inforred HIZARD/4 about

wInocus's visit and since then, for a period of the last five daya,

•IZARD/4 hea refused

to see or talk to HIdOOUS.

2. The COC has also apparently proposed sending IROQUE

intelligence gathering mission to Katanga.

WIROGUE aaked If KUBARK were

interested in this undertaking.

We advised him strongly againat this

move and added we hid no interest whatsoever in the projeot.

HIROTUS has also net the ODOATH representative and showed him

the model submarine which was the subject of ACLi-630.

representative evinced intereat in this model and through the ODIT

representative, whoi iIROGUE has seen on several occasions and discussed

the probler of purchasing plares for the GOS, the ODOATH representative

was awaro that kINOCUs has an Ordre de Lisaion oigned by WIZARD/2 to

travel to PBP.3G.

He said for "IPOJJS to inform him when he was ready

to depart and he would arrange for #IROGUE to conteot appropriate ODOATH

paople in PUPALE to discuss the nodel.

4. HIROGUE a proached GUTIZA! on Movember 24 and SALVACK on November

a request whether he might be of use to KUBARK either in Afrioa

or elsewhore in the world; and that he would like to be taken back into

He is obviously concerned about his position in the GOd at this

time and feels with the diploatic relations being establiahed between

Belgium and the GOC that bis position will become increasingly weaker.

reemphasize past assessments of MIROGUD, he is far too disorganized an

individual to be

an effective fI agent but would probably be useful where

action is required but detailed accurate reporting is not. Ihe station

agrees with

an early statement made concerning VINOCUS that he has a

pecullar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and

extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of

an aotion type.
