2.-..On29 Novatiber 1961-iTROGUB tld the undersigned that he felt his

“.. ‘position’ vis-a-vis the Songolese ‘Governzent. way rapidly weakening. First,
WIROGUS-had-endoraed sending one of the advisors with the Congolese Air
Foree:to Surge: to purchase planes and later found WIisRb/4 was at least

gnizant of ‘@.sdcond GOS representative sent to-Surope on the aame missions

WIR0GU8 ‘made vague réferences. to sone 2,000;000 Congolese Frinca of the

405000,000 available for airplane piirchasea "going into sone0nd’s. pocket.”

WIHOGUE was incensed ‘at the move of the GOC in sending a parallel mission

to Burope and not informing hin of it. He saw WIZARD/2 and asked about

this other missions W1IZARD/2 apparently inforned WIZARD/4 about

“WIROGUS's visit and since then, for a period of ‘the last five days,

wI2eRD/4 hes refused to ese or talk to WIHOGUR. :

2. The GO? has also arently proposed sending HIXOQUE on an
intelligence gathering mission to Katanga. WIROGUe asked if KUBARK were
interested in this undertaking. We advised him strongly avainot thia
move and added we had no interest whatsoever in tha projeot.

3. WIKOGUY has also net the ODOATH representative and showed him
the model subrarine which was the subject of ACLA-630. The ODCATH
representative evinced interest in this model’ and through the ODUIT
Fepresentative, who WIROGUE has seen on several occasions and discussed
the probler of purchasing planes for the GOS, the ODOATH representative
was aware that HI#OCGU@ has an Ordre de Hission signed bj WIZARD/2 to
travel to PAP.IMS. ‘He said for ¥IZ0GUR to inform him when he was ready
to depart and he would arrange for ¥IROGUE to contgot appropriate ODOaTE
people in P3PRIKE to discuss tho model.

4. WIROGUS approached GUTEXAN on November 24 ‘and SALVACK on November
29 with a request whother he night be of use to KUBARK either in Africa
or elsewhore in the worlds and that he would like to be taken: back into
the fold. He 1e obviously concea=ned about his position in the GOU at this
tine and feels with the diplozatic relations being established between
Belgium and the GOC that his position will become increasingly wecker. To
Teenphasize past assessments of AIXUSUE, he ia far too disorganized an
individual to be an effective FI agent but would probably be useful where
action is required but detailed accurate reporting is not. ‘The station
agrees with an early statement made concerning WIKOGU that he has a
Peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and
extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of

an action type.
