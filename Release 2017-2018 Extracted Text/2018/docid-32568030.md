| Enclosed for the Bureau are nine (9) coples of an 95°47 |
; LHM2° containing interview with EARLE W., STEVENS at (3)
f Seattle.

It is noted the indices of the Seattle Office H
contain no derogatory information identifiable with STEVENS.
2 During the course of the interview with STEVENS he made
AZ several references to the tour which he ‘made.of many countries
a in Africa after leaving Moscow. In eonnection with this
he referred to the way some South African nations are
handling their "nigger problem" and said eur country should j
: learn a few things from them and get away from the current :
hilosophy in which we are taking many rights away from ‘
| 4 white people and giving them to the black people who have
_ no. basic wight to intrude on the private lives of white
a, people. Mr. JONES said he feels very strongly on this
matter and it was noted that he appeared to be very loud
and outspoken. This is pointed out as of possible interest
in the event future consideration should ever be given to
using him as a witness. In this connection it is also noted
that Washington Field Office letter dated October 10, 1963,
said that Mr. McDANIEL described STEVENS as “an honest,
loyal American, but one who could be described as an Ugly
American', in that he did not like Russia, Russians or
anything about them and let them know it at every opportunity.
