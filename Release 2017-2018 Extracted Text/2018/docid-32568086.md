copy of Departazont of
State letter dated March 8, 1963, concerning above-captioned subject.

New York is authorized to interview subject in accordance
with existing instructions relating to interviews of Security subjects.

Inasmuch as davestigation in this case indicates subject
and her husband, Louis Henry Jones, have violated current U. 8. laws
relating to travel to Cuba, the subject should be apprised of those
Constitutional rights which are pertinent when intervi
who may have violated Federal laws. New York should take cognizance,
however, that violation of travel restrictions is the primary
responsibility of the Department of State and the Bureau does not
desire that the impression be given that the FBI either polices or
enforces travel restrictions. You should, of course, inform the
subject the Bureau is aware of her and her husband’s travel to Cuba
in May, 1961, via Mexico. Obgsain from her any data which she will
furnish relative to her Cuban travel, including the date, place and
method of departure from the U. 8.3; whether she and her husband vere
aware of current restrictions regarding travel to Cuba prior to
leaving the U. 8.; and if she and her husband intended to travel to
Cuba when they left the U. 8, The date, place and method of subject's
return to Xho 8, should also be obtained, including the date she

groups. He has been a subscriber to the "National Guardian.” Subject's
mother was reportedly a CP member in 1942. Both were interviewed in
1950 and refused to furnish any information concerning their past
activities and to state if they had ever been members of the CP.

With respect to State’s comment re availability of Bureau
informants for passport hearing, all current information shows subject
intends to return to Cuba in near future. An effort to interview her
is logical step to determine if she will admit illegal travel. The
enly sources who might be made available for passport hearing re her
illegal travel would be Mexican Immigration authorities, but in view
of time limit involved this is not being pursued at this time, it being
noted that we have received no request from the Department of Justice
requesting specific investigation looki: toward prosecution of subject
for violation of current travel laws. WO
