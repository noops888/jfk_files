mother

was reportedly a CP member in 1942. Both were intervlewed in

1950 and refused to furnish any information concerning their past

activitles and to state if they had ever been members of the CP.

With respect to State'e comment re availability of Bureau

Informants for passport hearing, all current information shows subject

intends to return to Cuba in near future. An elfort to interview her

is logical stop to determine 1f she will adnit illegal travel.

only sources who night be made available for passport hearing re her

Illogal travel would be Mexican Innigration authorities, but in view

of time limit Involved this is not being pursued at this time, it being

noted that we have recolved no request fron the Department of

Justice

requesting specific investigation looking toward prosecution of subject

for violation of current travel laws. sh
