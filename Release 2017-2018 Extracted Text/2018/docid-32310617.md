MIAMI

AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

1. Will contact logical informants and sources
in an effort to ascertain subject's current activities and
connections with regard to the Cuban government.

2. Will follow and report deportation proceedings
regarding the subject.

ADMINISTRATIVE

It is to be noted that a 134 file was opened on
the subject on 4/23/59, and was closed on 9/16/59, due to
the fact that. although PEREZ voluntarily furnished infor-
mation which was of assistance in the location of the
individuals in whom the Miami Office was interested,
investigation conducted toward the establishment of PEREZ's
reliability reflected that he was not considered reliable
or trustworthy by individuals who have been in contact
with him. Also, it was stated that he could not be depended
upon to furnish all information in his possession if with-
holding some would be to his advantage.

This report is classified “confidential” inasmuch
as it contains information the disclosure of which could
reasonably result in the identification of confidential
informants of continuing value.
