1. Beadguarters appreciates your dasire to avoid duplication of
effort and, az you suggested, consulted Wallace A. DEMOLAT, who was
unable to locate any identifying data concerning "Alla" other than that
furnished by Dr. RONNINGEA (copy of which you received as an attachment
to Gli-24330). He also located a copy of a memorandum entitled
“Defector Willian Martin Working in Moscow,” whic!. is being forwarded
for your information as Attachment A. le was unable to locate further
details of Dr. Waite'’s meetings with Martin.

2. Yor your further information and assistance, the background of
ODINCH and ODENVY interest in this matter is as follows:

a. 21 September 1964, ODINCH sent us a copy of the information
provided by Dr. Renninjer, copy of which we sent you with
26333, as indicated above. ODINCH expressed the hope of recuiving
a@ report fron Dr. Wnita - mentioned in Dr. Renninyor's report ~
regarding nis contacts in Moscow with Martin. ODINCH was informed,
by @ Headquarters component, that “We have no inforwation trom
Waite regarding his contacts with Martin,” and suqgested that a
copy of Dr. Ronninger's statenent be made available to ODEXv! for
its use when Dr.. White returned to thu United States.

b. It was sub-equently learned that Dr. White would be abroad
for another year, therefore, unavailable for an OOUNVY interview.
QLEX¥YY tnen levied the requirement of interviawiny Dr. White on us.
On 30 April 1965, ODENVY inquired of us, "Nas your Agency since
that time (1964) had an opportunity to interview or, White and
obtain additional identifying data regarding 'Alla' who was posri-~
bly engaged with Martin in a provocation attempt?" Hence, our
reqvest to you in paragraph 1 of reforence, that “ODENVY and ODINCH
are interested in having Dr. White interviewed for complete and
éetailed information goncerning his contacts with Martin and the
girl secretary named ‘Alla,' at the Institute.”

3. Headquarters desires to fulfill the above requests as
expeditiously as possible and does not feel that it is necessary to
perform a post mortem on the whole Martin-Mitchell case when their
expressed interest involves this one sories of events. It is felt
that ODINCH'a requiremant «an he met by having Or. Waite relate the
circumstances surrounding his contacts with Martin, Tais would include
dates, places and time of contacts, number of meetings, identity of
other persons involved, subject matter of discussions including Hartin's
reception, stay and treatment in and by the Soviet Unioa, also Martin's
reaction to sane, Soviet knowledge of and approval or ¢isapproval of
contacts, reasons for their discontinuance and Dr. White's reaction to
the whole experience. In connection with Dr. White's identification
of “Alla” it is highly unlixely he can furnish a voluztnous amount of
information since, according to Dr. Renninger, Dr. White sat-her only
a few times, Attached is a copy of a Personality Data Debrisfing Guide
which was prepared somo tine ago for general use in conaection with a
Headquarters project but has been found useful in other situations in
which fairly extensive information is desired concerning an individual.
You will no doubt find that many of the points ara not applicable in
this instance but it may suggest areas of information which wight stimu-
late the recollection of Dr. White.

4. With reference to an operational assessmont report on Dr. White
a general report covering the nature of his current work, political
and socdal attitudes, his private future plans and aspirations, secured
through your normal conversation with him, will be sufficient.
