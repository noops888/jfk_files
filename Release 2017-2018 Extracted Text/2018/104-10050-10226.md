tions of Lee Harvey OSWALD's
tion with the Agenc;

Sota ther/les Midgley and the DCI,
Dated 6 September 1975

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and that-fave crept up every so often
since then. In one form or. &ot x, the allegations are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD ha connected with the Agency.
The allegations are totayey “er £or ded.

2. The facts re, ‘tter are as follows: |

a. On ae b 3 Iwas instructed by |
* Mr. R.G.Roc ipmediate superior at that time, to
make a tho: ‘check\pithin the Agency at Headquarters

to determin : ee Harvey OSWALD had ever been
used by the AgencKor been connected with it in any
conceivable way. He ordered me to make the checks
directly and personally to the degree possible and not |
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R.
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the
Agency's key contact officials with the Warren
Commission. A

b. Although I had already checkeg& the Main Index i

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond H

that which I had already obtained before (plus. those i

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO ij
records which indicated any Agency connection with i
OSWALD. |

that the ‘result

siaiies’e ‘checks regarding use or employment-~\
D BadbSen requested by the foreign divisions
of their qecseriace stations, I was told, and the
results wede negative. ;

4. I recall very clearly that we were extremely |
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American: returning
from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by
DCD, thus having established contact with’ the- Agency.

The same point has now, quite understandably, been made
by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid
reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time. |
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD |
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before |
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite
uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in
those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade @ were so many persons travelling to
and from the Soyie®SUnion that DCD was incapable of talk~ |
ing to all of fhem? Therefore, a program of selectivity |
and specific-taryet applicability was instituted. In
light of th@\aBove/ seems to me that OSWALD-- if he
came to D@'syatkentjen at all--would have easily been i
simply did not possess the type of i
|

D was seeking at that time. DCD would
ts limited manpower on travellers who
later access in the USSR.

5 a fhould be added that my above-described
search in Phe Agency file holding produced no record or |

indication that any other US Government agency had used
him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

and were, of course, made available to all concerned,

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J. EDGAR HOOVER
26 November 1963 - 11:20 a. ih. te

DCI: I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

HS We have had the very best support that we could possibly i
expect from you.

DCL: Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

pa: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to
make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various
wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man ete. that firedthe gun. But there is no question |
that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i: Mexico City.
We have now found that the: photograph that was ta :en was not
that of Oswald. We do find from our informant dovm there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has -
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him
the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wad take three
weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

DCI: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have
those operational sources down there. We want to handle them
very carefully. It involves some very high level people down
there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

they use the cover of being scholarship students supported by the Cuban governmnt.
The DGI supplied them clothes, food, and every sort of care, such as medical and
any other kind. The DGL takes care of their general expandsene onew

Ordinarily ito an attempt is made to keep them from contact with smg anyone in
government circles soas to avoid indiscretions. Any agent recruited in a foreign
country is brought to Cuba and arrangewents are made so that he has no contactn
with persons in Cuba fron his om country or any other. Once his. training is
completed, his departure from Cuba is not. made known to anyone attached to him.

“In recruitment of Cubans, an effort is mads to find those knowing the fewest

possible persons. “If the Cuban who is recruited is employed in an office or
factory or works sofe other place, an effort is made to have him continue hig
vork so as to use his situation to provide true cover; instruction is given ab
hours when he is not working. If the agent has any trouble after he has been
recruited, the DOI tries to help him as mch as possible without breaking down
coapartmentation or his covers

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the UCI covers the ex-
penses of his family. If a Cuban vho is recruited is unamployed, it looks for
a cover adapted to his situation, and the NGI takes care of all the expenses
the agent bas, including those of his fanily if he is married. He receives his
training in the hours adapted to his cover position. His life, like that of the
agent who is working, mst contime normal, just as it was before recruitment.

Cubans trained as agents, if their depar! the counbhy is not illegal,
leave with foreign’ passports.

SUBJECT: Lee Harvey =e

On 17 December Mr. mia Wiivised that the Buresu vas
anticipating a request from the Wguiission, named by President
Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials
supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-
vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by
the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with the/Sylvia DURAN
aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States
Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich
inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some
other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.
The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-
vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed
to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of = *
the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this
manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to
telephone taps.

bb was agreed with

We brought up the question of Gutierrez and received

. previously earned from the FBI, though somewhat attenuated

because, as Scott and White pointed out, the FBI was carrying
the primary responsibility with Gutierrez. We suggested that
Gutierrez' story might be confirmed or refuted by photographs
taken by the CIA, that in particular the automobile he claimed
to have seen might show up on the fringes of some of these
photographs, and we inquired whether an appropriate examina-
tion of the picture reels had been made. White replied that
such an examination had not yet been made and that he
suspected that it would’ disclose nothing new, because the
photographs covered little more than the entrance itself,
However, he promised to_make such an examination. (About a

Slawson put out the suggestion thet the Commission might

Silvia Duran's statements and from the "open" investigations
carried on by FBI agents and Mexican police agents throughout
"Mexico, supplemented to some extent by the information obtained
through the CIA's wire-tapping activities and the CIA's

rather, for example, 1t would use phrases like "in the after-
noon" in place of "4:05 p.m." Also, no abswlute quotes would
be used. Only the substance of conversations would be given.
The sources for this narrative would be stated to be Silvia
Duran's interrogation, the "open" investigations and "other

confidential sources considered reliable by the Commission and

open in Mexico, where Osborne was at last report, for ‘keeping

He felt sure the Mexicans would comply. This means that
Osborne, be’ng a person under suspicion and being an alien, is

told that he must come into a certain police station and report

on a regular basis. Tuo weeks is a common interval for this

sort of thing, but is sometimes even done on a daily basis.

i. One of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate other
than his first was in the afternoon. See paragraph 11 of the
first police interrogation.

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban
“Consulate at least twice and probably three times.
This seems so because:
a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the
Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday.

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban
Consulate at least once on Friday and at least once on

Saturday, see CIA memorandum, pages 6 through 8,

e.- Oswald's argument with Azque was in the after-

occurred after the first visit, see the second police inter-

< Silvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get '

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip i

Letter to the Cen gence Agency (CIA)

Posing Certain Guestions” on their Letter to Us
@ated 31 January 1964

I would include in our letter to cue CIA the following
. questions:

1. . Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged
meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was
Poe supposed to have taken place in an automobile outside the
tT. +" @uban Eabassy an Mexico City? -.--

2. Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet
Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? If you
do, can we find out its contents?

3. Reference 1s made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your
letter. Would it be possible for us to see the full report
: ee the Mexigan a police, interrogati ns. of Hrs. Duran and her i
usbarid?.- .

4, Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald,
"that same afternoon," came back "again" to the Cuban
Embassy. Does this mean that he was there twice the same
day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous
day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the
Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this
sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed information
found in the subsequent paragraphs. In general, we would
eppreciate as much a ation as you can give us on the H
time sequence of thd aragraph 7. Of ‘
sourse, if you are a the full text of \-

6. Reference is made to ¢] sentence in the 2nd

subparagraph of paragraph 12b, Is there any significance
to the word, "Although"? We wonder whether the informant
vmeant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran
reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued
to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

. 7. Refermce is again made to the 2nd subparagraph of
‘paragraph 12b. Your letter states that Mrs. Duran told the
Soviet Embassy” that Oswald"knew no one in Cuba} and that
the Soviet official "echoed her statement that the American
. _ Was not known." It 1s unclear to us whether this discussion
bf . 4nvolved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet
officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not knowing
anyone in the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies.

8. Reference is made to paragraph l2c. Was the “direct |
conversation" between one of the members of the Soviet
Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was . 4
at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that |
Mra. Duran sent Oswald personally over ay the Soviet Sta! !

- ta -contadt.one of tha officials there? - a H

9. Reference is again made to paragraph l2c. Could
you clarify the many references to the "address" referred to
so frequently in this paragraph?

10. yTaroughout your entire letter the term "Soviet i
Consulate” seems te be used interchangeably with the ters '
“Soviet Embassy," Likewise with "Cuban Consulate" and fl
“Cuban Embassy." We assume from this that the Soviet ct
Consulate and the Soviet Embassy must be the same in Mexico H
Gity, or at least if) fhe a that the same
must hold true for Cuban Consulate.

b. QUWIN, inl RO 9 | competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles
in Europe where we have very few assets. Whether this
is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends
on the determination of how he can be used either by *
the German Statioi x DY ,4 the Austrian Station or by
any other KUBARK t’as a long term unofficial
cover agent. He is not being used at the present time.
He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any
operational assignments are concerned.

ec. It is recommended that the present Chief of
Station Luxembourg and RABNEY be consulted by
Headquarters for their best recommendations as to
the continued use of QUWIN. After these recommendations
are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian
stations be consulted for their possible interest in
using him. If after these discussions a sensible
framework for the operational use of QJWIN can be
established, I would recommend we continue him. If
not, I would recommend that he be terminated at the
time his present contract expires.

1, It makes little Hidtk BH, JEDNOOD had at one time an

OI interest in Oswald. As soon as I had heard Oswal8's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sonetime in Summer 1960 --
with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the layang

on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable channels, At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family ...'_
were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival. :

oe

2. I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck >
me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I
told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get
the information we need, because this individual looks odd." } We were
particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on th¢ Minsk
factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city
itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop
target personality dossiers,

3. %I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at
the time, Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's artival.
I do not know what action developed thereafter.

4, As an afterthought, I Ph T also oe at the time I was becoming
increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered
in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet 4
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually
divorcing their spouses and. settling down abroad without returning "home".
The AEOCEAN 3 case. was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases, We established links between

some of these women and the KGB. KUDESK became interested in the developing
trend we had come across. It was partly out of curiosity to learn if
Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of
interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational
intelligence interest in th story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Repart conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that
effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1 Dissemination to the Intelligence Community
£.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission
£.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations:

all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by
cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file. Ad-
ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.
Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

received copies of all CSCI's.
