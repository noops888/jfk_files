LUKES.

The referent memorandum contains two points

which require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

The allegations are totally

wtfounded.

2. The facts regarding

thie matter are as follows:

Wovember. 1963 I was instructed by

• Mr. R. G. Rocca

my immediate superior at that time, to

make a thoroigh

check thin the Agency at Headquarters

to determine whethe

STee Harvey OSWALD had ever been

the Agencylor been connected with it in any

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the Warren

Although I had already checked, the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus those

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination).

There was nothing in the DDO

The next component I checked was DCD.

Office called the Office of Personnel

I also checked the Office of Medical

Services and found no record on OSWALD.

i. The Covert Action Staff also found no record

on him.

Finally, I also checked the recoras oin the

CI staff's Operational Approval Group (CI/OA) with

negative results.

My checks were completed on 4, December 1963

and I then sent a brief informal note to Mi. Rocca

specifying all the checks I had made and stating

that the results showed that Lee Harvey OSWALD

had never had any connection whatsoever with the

Agenex:

Eventually a statement to this effect

was communicated to the Warren Commission.

Similar checks regarding use or employment

of OSKALD Kad Been requested by the foreign divisions

of their appropriate stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

I recall very clearly that we were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American returning

from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by

DCD, thus having.

established contact with the Agency

The same point has now, guite understandably, been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before

1957/1958.

Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that time was quite

uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in

those days.

The thaw began in about 1956 and by

of that decade there were so many persons travelling to

and from the SoviesJUnion that DCD was incapable of

ing to all of them.

Therefore, a program of selectivity

and specific target applicability was instituted.

light of the above i

seems to me that OSWALD-

came to DID @attention at all would have easily been

by-passed because he

simply did not possess the type of

information that DeD was seeking at that time.

DCD would

surely have

used its limited manpower on travellers who

had

reater access in the USSR.

should be added that my above-described

search in the Agency file holding produced no record or

indication that any other US Government agency had used

him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CIA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun.

But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.

We have now found that the: photograph that was ta sen was not

that of Oswald.

We do find from our informant doin there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give hir

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wald take three

weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there.

We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

who is handling it for the Department

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache in Mexico CIty dealing with the Sylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that

some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich

Inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

In which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps.

Anderson agreed that It would be a workable arrangement. In

this connection it came out that Osrald's tourist card appli-

the FBI Mexcan office and therefore authenticating it rould

be a problem to be handled elgewhere. We agreed that we 10.id

1. One of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate other

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

Consulate at least twice and probably three times.

This seems so because:

a There is no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or

Wednesday•

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban

Consulate at least once on Friday and at least once on

Saturday, see CIA memorandum, pages 6 through 8.

that he visited the Cuban Consulate on

and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which

S1]via Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip

telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,

I would Include In our letter to the CIA the following

questions:

Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

supposed to have taken place in an automobile outside the

Cuban Embassy In Mexico Cit? ...

2. Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet

Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? If you

do, can we find out its contents?

3. Reference is made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your

of the Mexican police interrogations of krs. Duran and her

husbard?

4.

Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald;

"that same afternoon,"

came back "again" to the Cuban

Embassy.

Does this mean that he was there twice the same

day, or

does it mean that he was there once on the previous

day

and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the

Soviet Embassy? Only the lattar Interpretation of this

sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed Information

agent who is capable of operating in certain

circles

in Europe where we have very few assets.

Whether this

is of sufficient worth to continue his

services depends

on the determination of how he can be used either by

che German Station or

the Austrian Station or by

any other KUBARK themant as a long term unofficial

He is not being used at the present time.

He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any

operational assignments are concerned.

It is recommended that the present Chief of

Station Luxembourg and RABNEY

be consulted by

Headquarters for their best recommendations as to

the continued use of QJWIN.

After these recommendations

are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian

stations be consulted for their possible interest in

using him.

If after these discussions a sensible

framework for the operational use of QJWIN can be

established,

I would recommend we continue him.

I would recommend that he be terminated at the

time his present contract expires.

As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission.

It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E. 1

Dissemination

to the Intelligence Community

E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations

to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file.

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
