This memorandum records for the record my efforts

Seeta with De Thomas reatner, Special Assistant to the

Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, on 6/25/75.

On the late afternoon of 7/24/75, Mr. Benson

Buffham, Deputy Director, National Security Agency (NSA),

made available to Liaison Agent Brian Murphy a copy of a

"Top Secret" memorandum dated 4/20/71, written by Louis W.

Tordella, who was the then Deputy Director of NSA. This

Memorandum for the Record, Subject: Shamrock, copy of which

is attached, makes reference to a file entitled Shamrock

available in the office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for

Intelligence, United States Army.

Pursuant to your instructions on the evening of

7/24/75, I personally contacted Mr. Latimer at approximately

8:00 a.m., 7/25/75. In my conversation with Mr. Latimer, I

noted that it was imperative that I see him as soon as

possible regarding the contents of the Shamrock file.

Mr. Latimer was informed that the Bureau was attempting to

establish the line of authority relative to the Bureau's

procurement of foreign government's cable

traffic sent

re Banne in the red set a

from Mr. Buffham on the late afternoon of 7/24/75 and was

aware of the Bureau's interest in reviewing certain memoranda

in the Shamrock file. Mr. Latimer indicated that this was

a matter of interest to the General CounsellE the Department

of Defense and that he would have to consult with them.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

He advised me he would have somebody from the General Counsel's

office, Department of Defense, promptly contact me regarding

a review of this file by FBI personnel.

Not hearing from Mr. Latimer by the late morning

of 7/25/75, I telephonically contacted his office. He was

not available and I asked his secretary to have him return

my call. Shortly before noon, Mr. Latimer returned my call

and explained that he had discussed my request with

Mr. "Marty" Hoffman (phonetic) of the Department of Defense.

It was Latimer's understanding that Mr. Hoffman had gone to

the White House to discuss my request with Mr. Philip Buchen,

Counsel to the President. Latimer promised that he would

telephonically recontact me as soon as he could establish

contact with Hoffman.

I again reiterated to Latimer that it

was imperative the Bureau have access to the Shamrock file

in order that we could advise the Attorney General as to

its contents hoping to clearly demonstrate that both the

then Attorney General Thomas Clark and, in fact, President

Truman himself were aware of certain information contained

what was at issue here and that he would get back to me as

soon as possible.

At 1:50 p.m., 7/25/75, I again called Mr. Latimer's

office and his secretary informed me that Mr. Latimer had

stepped out of his office and that she would give him a

message to call me as soon as he returned. As of 4:00 D.M.,

7/25/75, I had not received a return call from Mr. Latimer.

ACTION:

For information and record purposes.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: SHAMROCK

Mr. Buffham and I had an opportunity this morning to read

the SHAMROCK file in ACSI. Major General Joe! McChristian gave

us permission to view it but once we had read it,after careful con-

sideration he decided that he would not feel free to give NSA either

the file or a duplicate copy without personal permission from SecDef

inasmuch as SecDef had entrusted the file to ACSI in 1949. All of

us agreed that an approach to the Secretary would be unnecessary

and perhaps would generate too many questions. He did agree

after sealing the file again to limit access to the Secretary of Defense

on demand, the Director or the Deputy Director, NSA, on demand,

the -tid suland the Chief of the SSO, ACST. This wored le noted on

The file contained memoranda for record, one prepared after

a meeting in Forrestal's office attended by senior officials from ITT,

Western Union, and RCA plus Marks Leva (then Defense General

Counsel), Secretary Forrestal, and a representative from the Attorney

General's office. Colonel Carter Clark from ACSI, who was present,

prepared this memorandum. A subsequent meeting was held in Secre-

tary Louis Johnson's office attended by representatives. of the same

three companies and I believe the Attorney General himself. In Mr.

• Johnson's own handwriting is a note to the effect that he showed the

memorandum for record to President Truman and a note that ICC, ap-

parently Attorney General Thomas Clark, either was present or had

also discussed the matter with the President.

Both memoranda indi-

cated that the companies were informed that the work they were doing

was of very great importance to the U.S. and every effort would be

made to protect knowledge of its existence as well as to protect the

companies in the event of exposure.

The material is filed under TS Control No. 516652-3-5 in the

SSO ACSI files.

ROJECT MOGKINEBIRD

Project Mockingbir, a telephone intercept activity, was conducted

between 12 March 1963 and

15 June 1963, and targeted two Washington-

based newsmen who, at the time, had been publishing news articles

based on, and frequently quoting, classified materials of this Agency

and others, including Top Secret and Special Intelligence.

Telephone intercept connections were installed at the newmen's

office and at each of their homes, for a total of 3. The connections

were established with the assistance of a telephone company officiai

'who responded to a personal request by the Director of Security, Col.

Sheffield Edwards. Col. Edwards' authority for the activity was Mr.

John A. McCone, Director of Central Intelligence. The latter conducted

the activity in coordination with the Attorney General (Mr. Robert Kennedy),

the Secretary of Defense (Mi. Robert Mclamara), and the Director of

the Defense Intelligence Agency (Gen, Joseph Carroll). In addition to

Office of Security personnel directly involved in the intercepts and

• research of materials acquired therefrom, only 3 other Agency

officials are on record as witting of the activity: the Deputy Director

of Central Intelligence (General MarshallS. Carter), the Inspector

General (Lyman Kirkpatrick) and the General Counsel. (Mr. Lawrence

Houston).

The intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying con-

tacts of the newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources

of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they

received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom were identified; 12 senators

and 6 members of Congress, all identified; 21 Congressional staff members,

of whom 11 were identified; lo government employees, including a staff

member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an

Assistant Attorney General, and other well-placed individuals. A number

of other sources were partially or tentatively identified, but the short span

of the activity precluded positive identification. It was observed that through

these contacts the newsmen actually received more classified and official

data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen

for release, establishing that many "leaks" appearing under other by-lines

were actually from the sources of the target newsmen.

Since the termination of Project Mockinguird, those materials related

to it which were retained, have been maintained under strict security access

was confined and interrogated until 13 August 1965 when

he was moved to a specially constructed "jail"' in a

remote

wooded area at ISOLATION. The SR Division was convinced

that he was a dispatched

agent but even after a long

period of hostile

interrogation was unable to prove their

contention and

he was confined at ISOLATION in an effort

to convince him to "confess."

This Office together with the Office of General

Counsel

became incrcasingly concerned with the illegality

of the Agency's position in handling a defector, under

these conditions

for such a long period of time.

Strong

representations were made to the Director (MI. Helms) by

this Office, the Office of General Counsel, and the

Legislative

Liaison Counsel, and on 27 October 19fä, the

responsibility for his

further handling was transferred

to the Office of Security under the direction of the Députy

Director of Central Intelligence, then Admiral Rufus Taylor.

The Soviet defector

•was moved to a comfortable safehouse in

the Washington area and was interviewed under friendly,

sympathetic conditions by his Security Case Officer, Mr.

for more than a year.

It soon became apparent

that the Soviet defector

was bona fide and he was moved

to

more comfortable surroundings with considerable freedom

of independent movement and has continued to cooperate

fully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and this

Office since that time. He has proven to be the most

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: General: Office of Security Survey

1. At the Director's instruction, and with the concurrence

of the then DD/P, the Office of Security developed informants in

•RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security

questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a

dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of

three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current

interest.

2. The principal object of Security's interest through this

informant is

a female who was employed in RID for a number of years

until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation

of a security review on her by the Office of Security, but Security does

not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at

the time of her resignation.

3. Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by

reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance

with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also

being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have

an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also sub-

sequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among

clerical and secretarial employees of the Agency. Among these

employees is one girl who works in a

• biographic section in SB Division.

4. Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID

employee entered into a common-law marital relationship with the

Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this

capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially

those requiring passport photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought

to employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.

•Cricks

## 55108 DooId:32989624 Page 24

## Page 25

5. Information on the background of the Cuban is fairly extensive,

• but it is inconclusive.

He is known to have been a momber of anti-

Castro organizations

this country. There are al

reports that

his mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time. Intre are other

episodes in his life that suggest intelligence involvement on his part

with some hostile service, but this is not yet definitely established.

:6. The Office of Security has had at times a second informant

in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the

principal informant.

7. There is conclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed

interest in certain 201 files in the Agency, and there are good groundso

for believing that the RID female employee delivered at least one such

•file to the Cuban while she was still in RID. There is also evidence

that the female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent

contact with her friend, the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On

one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions

from the Cuban to O/S's principal informant. The informant has no

knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been

levied on or satisfied by the SB employee. Neither does he know of

• the extent of contacts by this couple with other Agency employees

except social contacts.

8. The Office of Security has been running this operation for

over two years, in an effort to obtain conclusive proof of its intelli-

gence nature.

CI Staff has been kept informed. The FBI, which

was informed of the case at an early stage, has declined to take re-

sponsibility for it, on grounds that it concerns CIA's internal security.

As a result, the Office ofSecurity has been inhibited in the actions

it can take against the Cuban suspect. On the other hand, Security

has not taken any action against Agency employees for fear of com-

promising the operation.

9. It would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied

with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures

to resolve doubts about the case, O/S has followed the course of watch-

ful waiting, hoping the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that

would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge

of the relationship between the Cuban and the several other current

Agency employees with whom he is known to have contact continues

-2.

00063

HH 55108 DocId:32989624 Page 25

---

## Page 26

to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made

any further approaches to Security's informant recently, although he

• continues to see them

ocially. Thus, there is slir

reason to beliere

that further waiting will produce a break in the case.

10. There are two courses open to the Office of Security now.

It can attempt to have the Agency employees known to be in contact

with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might

alert the Cuban to our penetration of the operation, particularly

since a plausible reason for transier would be difficult to develop

for some of the persons involved. Alternatively, Security could

move overtly and charge the Agency employees with violation of the

security regulation requiring reporting of contacts with foreign

nationals. This would, of course, terminate the Office of Security's

operation.

11. One of these courses of action should be chosen promptly.

The possibility that the employee in SB Division may be passing

information on

is too great to warrant further

delay in moving against her. Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban

has current productive penctrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage

to the Agency seems clearly to outweigh any. possible gains from

continuing this CI effort.

MENOR INDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management & Services

SUBJECT

• Press Allegations re Use of Agency

Polygraph

•1.

: This memorandum is for your information only

and confirns a report I made to you by telephone earlier

today.

2. On 22 July 1971, an article was carried on

American proposals rclative

to the SALT talks in The New

York Times over the by-line of Iden 18l.

It was

devastatingly accurate

and contained direct quotes

from

a Presidential advisory menorandum the White House had

sent to Mir. Gerard Smith, Director, Arms Control

and

Disarmament Agency, a feir days earlier.

The

President

was alleged to be furious with this unauthorized dis-

closure of classified information and directed

a sweeping

investigation within the United States Government to

determine the source of the disclosure. Investigation

was conducted under the direction of MI. Egil Krogh and •

Mr. David Young, Staff Assistants to Mr. John

Ehrlichman,

Counsel to the President for Domestic Affairs.

3. On the basis of investigations conducted by

State Security and Defense officials, four individuals--

one individual in the Department of Defense and three

individuals in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--

were tabbed

as leading suspects. Mr. Egil Krogh contacted

me on 26 July 1971 and requested that we arrange to polygraph

the three suspects in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency

and volunteered the information that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation would be asked

to polygraph the one suspect

in the Department of Defense.

4. I informed Mr. Krogh that from time to time

in matters involving the national

security the Agency had

detailed to Mr. G. Marvin Gentile, virector of state

security, a polygraph operator and a polygraph machine for

his use in polygraphing state Departnent employees no

were recipients of allegations concerning their loyalty.

I emphasized that this procedure had the Director's

approval and that State clearly understood that the examin-

ation was their total responsibility.

I further informed

him that this was the only way we could undertake to enter-

tain his request and that even

then it would require the

• specific approval of the Director. Mr. Krogh asked me to

obtain such approval and work out such arrangements with

Mr. Gentile.

5.

Later that same day, Mr. Krogh called Mr. Gentile

and inquired as

to whether the

arrangements nad been made.

Mr. Gentile indicated

they had and

suggested that the same

polygraph operator be used to examine the Defense suspect.

Mr. Krogh informed vir. Gentile that he considered this an

excellent idea and that he would instruct Defense officials

to make their man available to Mr. Gentile for a polygraph

examination.

6. The four individuals were Iden 182

of the Department of Defense and Iden 183

Iden 184

• and

Iden 185

• of

the Arms Control and Disarnament Agency. The polygraph

examinations resulted in clearing the four men and

the

results of the exaninations were forwarded over my signature

to MI. Gentile on 29 July 1971. A copy of my covering

memorandum is attached.

7. • Iden 186

a staff wiiter for The

Washington Post, in an article dated 3 September 1971

stated that a State Department spokesman had acknowledsed

at a news briefing that agents of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation had

suspected of leaking information on the SALT talks in

July. MI. John Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation in a

letter to The Hashingtch Post and said that the polygraph

examinations had bein concucted by another agency. Specu-

lation centered around the Agency, but after a day or so,

8. Iden 186

apparently has never been satisfied

and has been pressing ir: Charles Bray, State Department

spokesman,

for confirmation of Agency involvement.

Bray learned today that Iden 186

plans to use a press

conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this atternoon

to press

this point further. Mir. Bray has been given guidance by

Mr. Gentile to avoid confirmation but if this is impossible

he will indicate the examinations were conducted by State

Department Security officials utilizing an operator and

a machine detailed to the Department for this purpose. I

do not know whether or not the fact that the government-iide

investigation was directed by Mr. Egil Krogh is known to

Iden 186

but I suspect that it is and that this is the

reason why the matter has been raised again. Mr. David

Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an

internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the

White House was satisfied that no Agency employee was

the source.

Special Report

1. This memorandum is in response to a request to

provide information on situations or associations that

might appear to be irregular on the surface.

2. Details to the White House and Government Agencies

Background:

For many years the Centrai intelligence Agency nas

detailed employees to the immediate office of the white House

per se and to components associated intimately with the immediate

office of the President such as the Council on International

Economic Policy and

the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board.

We

have furnished secretarios, clerical

employees and certain professional employees on a reimbursable

and non-reimbursable basis.

At the present time, ve

have no

clericals or professionals assigned to the immediate White

House office, but we do have one young man detailed to their

Communications Section. There are detailees to PFIAB and CIEP.

I might point out that we had

detailed to the White House as

late as

the

fall of 1970 couriers,

telephone operators,

laborer

assigned to the grounds and a graphics

man who

designed

invitations

for State dinners.

By October of 1970, more funds

were apparently available to run the White House and most of

our detailees were hired

as bona fide White House employees.

CIA is not the only Agency furnishing the White House with

detailees.

Levies have been made by this Administration and

others on

Defense and State and other Government entities

whose employees have Top Secret clearances.

Professional officers have been and are at the present

time assigned to the National Security Council and we have seven

clericals on detail to NSC on a reimbursable basis.

In addition to the above, we have technical specialists

detailed to NSA, an instructor at the National lar College and

security officers detailed to the Department of State to

Discussion: Details to iSC, the white House, isA and the

National Har College are probably quite ¿ofersible. On the other

hand, there may be those who would question Agency employees

currently workirg at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs

and Mr.

Peter Peterson having an Agency employee as his

secretary when he was the Secretary of Cormerce (she also made

a trip with him to Moscow).

She is still with him in his

present assignment but we

expect that she will redort to NSC for

a new detail sometime this month. Iden 112

served for

years as Director of the Office of Public Safety for

AID. This information has been kept "close to the vest" during

that entire period of time. He has been approved for disability

retirement and is presently on sick leave and will retire

automatically at the expiration of this leave.

Each detail of an Agency employee to the White House or

other Government agency has been carefully considered and

approval

at a higher level obtained when professionals were

involved.

4. Project TWOFOLD: I believe the support we are

providing to Project TrOFOLD is an activity that should be .

reported under your guidelines.

Since this is an extremely

sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on

it, I will not repeat the details in my memorandum.

5.

Individuals Engaged in Domestic Activities: In a more

general sense, Contract Personnci Division prepares and executes

contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out

domestic activities. He also process Staff Agents who are

domestically assigned. None of these assignments are decided

in OP. I really have no way of knowing with any degree of

certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be.

6. Arrangemerts with American Firms: In the interest of

reporting

"too much,

" I would remind you

that Contract Personnel

The actual

ments are

overseas.

The arrangements, however, are backstopped,

in the main, in the United States.

7. Contractua

RelationshiD - USJPRS:

he Agency

organization, USJPR

nas a contractual assoc

cation with

approximately 1,500 independent contractors and 45 contract

employees.

These individuals are unwitting of the fact that

they really york for lin the performance of their domestic

activities.

They perform a translation service

of unclassified documents

for the Government.

The independent

contractors work in their cin homes and are

given

assignments

as the need

arises.

The contract employees

"integrated"

into the bureau of Standards and are located in Washington, D. C.

They are paid and administered by the Bureau. CIA reimburses

the Bureau.

Their basic contracts of employment are prepared

in Contract Personnel Division.

' 8. Hunt Requests a Lockpicker: This is a record of

External Enploynent issistance branch's action on a request

from Howard Hunt for a lockpicker who might be retiring or

resigning from the Agency:

Sometime

in the spring of 1972, Iden 38

uf EEAB

received a call from

licward Hunt who asked iden 38 if he had a

• retiree or resignee who was accomplished at picking locks.

Iden 38

sent him

a resume on Thomas. Anato who retired

31 July 1971: Iden 39

did

not document his LEAB

record

to show the date of this exchange, but Mr. Thomas-Hester (who

also works in EEAB) opines that it occurred sometime between

March and May 1972.

All of the above information was reported to the Office

of Security on 4 October 1972

following the FBI's contact with

the Agency regarding toward fiunt.

9. Resume Sent to McCord: Ross Lambert, a contract

employee uno retired in septender 1911, was a client of the

exter re rementent de is the Branch tents lamen for a job

James McCord's security business.

EEAB sent a resume to

McCord, but Lambert was not hired.

In mid-summer 1972, Mr. Lambert telephoned EEAB from

Chicago. (He had a job

there with the Halifax Security Co.,

a lead provided by EEAB, but until this telephone call he had

following items are pertinent:

also attended by Mr. William

Colby.

Colonel White explained that the Technical Services

Division (ISD) had been requested to provide assistance

to the FBl for a sensitive project

Colonel White did not dis-

close

the purpose of the assistance being provided by ISD

but did instruct me to assist ISD on purely contractual

matters.

however,

proximately s1 million, and

b.

Ine Procurement Division, OL, currently has tho

requisitions in hand from TSD which would

involve reim-

bursable sales to the FBI. One

such

requisition

amount of $56,900 is for

Bausch

No action is being taken on either of

these requirements pending further instructions which

will be sought from the Deputy Director for Management

and Services.

c. Over the years, this Agency has often supportec

other Government agencies tron a contractual or materiel

standpoint. Upon the submission of an officially approved

supported by a transfer of funds, the Agency

would either enter into "accomnodation procurements"

for

the requesting agency or support the requesting agency by

the issuance of materiel from stock. Such actions are

legally accomplished under the Economy Act of 1925. This

Act authorizes one agency to support the needs of, or pro-

vide a service for, another Government agency when such

action would be more economical and eliminate the need for

one

agency of the Government to duplicate facilities

procedure is

I have had

our records researched for the past 2 years and

Attachnent 1 reflects those transactions which appear to be

relevant to

the subject of this menorandum..

d.

In connection with the disclosures during the sum-

mer of 1971 that the

Rand Corporation was not properly

to visit the Pand Corporation and satisfy

himself that classified material furnished them by the

Agency was both properly safeguarded and accounted for.

Has report was affirmative.

On

25 August 1971, the senior

Security Officer assigned

to this Office forwarded a

letter to the Rand Corporation stressing and reaffirming

the procedures Rand must follow in safeguarding classified

information furnished them by the Agency. Of residual

interest in this matter, there is summarized

the contents

of a memorandum of 2 July 1971 to the Executive Director-

Comptroller from the DD/I which is in our possession.

This memorandum reports that FBIS regularly

disseminated reports to the Rand Corporation

but that instructions had been issued to cease

distribution of classified reports.

While no

other direct dissemination went to

Rand, other

USIB agencies, primarily USAF, were passing

"many" copies of DD/I products to Rand as au-

thorized under USIB regulations.

The memoran-

dum also states that Rand personnel had

requested searches and document retrieval from

the CRS facility.

5. In connection with action taken for the Office of

Security, there are three

relevant items:

a.

The Printing Services Division, OL,'

was requested

by the Office of Security to print a book written by

Hany y. Harpi, Office of Security. The book was pre-

pared by ta turnhy under a Brookings Institution Federal

It is a full treatise on the existence of sources of in-

and it is our understanding that the distribution ras mace

to appropriate agencies of the Federal Government.

A copy

of MI. Murphy's book can be made available for review if

desired.

Sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law

Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAT) requested

that the Agency give consideration to our publishing, at

LEAA expense,

an unclassified version of this volume.

It

was the intent of LEiA to make broad-scale distribution

to Police Departments throughout the country.

The Director

of Security and I consulted on this matter and jointly

determined

that the Lead request should not be honored be-

cause the Agency should not put itself in the position of

publishing law enforcement material for general and un-.

classified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our print-

ing facilities.

b. On 5 January 1971, the Director of Security re-

quested that I approve his leasing up to eleven motor

vehicles for use in connection with a special support

operation which would last approximately 3 months.

The

Director of Security informed me, in his requesting memo-

randum of 5 January 1971, that "This support activity has

been undertaken at the specific instruction of the Director

pose the bree.

and has his personal approval."

The request las approved.

c.

From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has

requisitioned from this Office a considerable amount of

materiel which we understand was to be given or loaned by

them to local Police Departments. In certain cases

some

of this materiel was issued from Agency stocks and, in

other cases, direct procurement of the materiel as made

by funds furnished by the Office of Security.

A complete

listing of such materiel is found in Attachment 2.

with month-to-month renewals thereafter. As an OL standby

and the Miami Beach Police.

The staff provided

support

to these activities in monitoring, identification and

In late September 1972, NSA, through Division D/

DDo, requested that the Special

Programs Division initiate

a hearability survey of certain he long-distance commercial

telephone circuits between the U.S. and

South America.

The circuits carried drug related long-distance calls

of

interest to the BiDD and other U.S. agencies. Because of

the availability of personnel and technical

capabilities,

the survey was conducted at the OC Relay Station at Iden 92

removed at the time of the arrest and were not being installed as

originally reported.

SUBJECT

• : Contacts with Individuals Named in the Watergate Matter

1. I am addressing this to you instead of to the Director of Central

Intelligence since I doubt that the information contained herein is of such

significance to warrant his interest and because it has been on record with

the Agency since July 1972. However, if you feel that the information is of

such interest that it should be forwarded to the Director I shall put it in the

proper format to do so.

2. My only contact with anyone named in connection with the

Watergate and related matters was through

a former

Agency employee now retired and living in Winterhaven, Florida. In

December 1971

called me from Florida and advised that he

wanted to get in touch with Howard Hunt. He said that he did not have Hunt's

home phone number and that it was probably unlisted but that since Hunt was a

former employee, could I contact Hunt and ask him to givel

a call.

I had only met Hunt once about 10 ycars before but I agreed to relay the message.

i called Howard Hunt at his home and told him that

did not have his

home phone and requested he call

Mr. Hunt thanked me for

relaying the message and said that he would call

Jin December 1971. Attached is a copy of a Memorandum for the

Activity Related to Domestic Events

1. OCI began following Caribbean black radicalism

in earnest in 1968. The emphasis of our analysis was on

black nationalism as a political force in the Caribbean

and

as a threat to the security of the Caribbean states.

Iwo DDI. memoranda were produced on the subject:

"Black

Radicalism in the Caribbean" (6 August 1969), and "Black

Radicalisn in the Caribbean--Another Look"

(12 June 1970).

In each a single paragraph was devoica to tics with the

Us black power movement; the discussion primarily concerned

visits of Stokely Carmichael and other Us black power

activists to the Caribbean and other overt contacts.

2. In June 1970, Archer Bush of OCI was asked to

write a momorandum with

special attention to links be-

tween black radicalism in the Caribbean and advocates

black power in the us.

The record is not clear where

this request originatoa, but it came through channels

FrOM

the DCI.

The paper

was to be treated

as especially

sensitive and was to include material provided by the

Special Operations group of the CI Staff.

The CY staff

material was voluminous but did not proviac meaningíul

evidence of important links between militant blacks in

the US and the Caribbean.

This, in fact, was one of

the conclusions of the paper.

elements of CIA and to the USIB-member agencies, however, are

perhaps borderline or could be construed as illegal if nis-

I. In late spring of 1968 Walt Rostow, then

Spocial Assistant to the President for National Security

Affairs, tasked the DCI with undertaking a survey of

worlawide student dissidence. Contronted by timult at

campuses like Columbia ona mindful of the violence

accompanying student outbursts at Berlin's Free University

and elsewhere, Rostow sought to learn whether youthful

dissidence was interconnected; spawned by the same causes:

financed and hence manipulated by forces or influences

hostil: to the interests of the Us and its allies; or likely

to come under inimical sway to the detriment of US interests.

2. The paper was preparca by

with the assistance of the CA and CI Staffs.

phe ax a by

Of OCI

The DDI,

D/OCI, and|

met with Rostow to elicit the reasons

for his or the president's concerns and to agree on the

sources to be examined, the research methods to be followed,

etc.

3. Written during the summer of 1968, the most

sensitive version of Restless Youth comprised two sections.

The first was

a philosophical treatment of student unrest,

its motivation, histor; and tactics.

This section drew

heavily on overt literature and FBI reporting on Students

for a Democratic Society and affiliated groups.

In a sense,

the survey of dissent emerged from a shorter (30 page)

typescript study of SDS and

its foreign ties the same

author had done for Mir. Rostow at the DCI's request in

December 1967.

1. Because of the paucity of information on foreign

student movements, it was necessary to focus on SDS which

then monopolized the field of student action here and

abroad.

A second section comprised 19 country chapters--

ranging from Argentina to Yugoslavia--and stood by itself

as a review of foreign student dissidence.

5. Because SDS was a domestic organization, the

full paper Restless Youth, including the essay on world-

wide dissent went only to nine readers. A copy may be

in the Johnson Libraiy.

6. Following the paper's favorable reception by

the President and Mr. Rostow,

the DCI briefed the NSC

on student dissent.

The sensitive version subsequently

was updated and

sent to the White House in February 1969.

7. The less sensitive text was disseminated in

September 1968 and then updated and issued again in

:

March 1969 and August 1970.

SUBJECT

:Activity Related to Domestic Events :

In late 1967 OCI participated in the preparation

of several short intelligence memoranda dealing with the

foreign connections of US organizations and activists

volved in the anti-var movement. The main purpose of

these reports, prepared at the request of the Winite House,

was to determine whether any links existed between inter-

national Communist elonents or forcign governments and the

American

peace movement.

The conclusion reached was that

there was some evidence of ad hoc contacts between anti-

war activists at home and abroad but no evidence of

direction or formal coordination.

2.

In October 1967 President Johnson expressed

interest in this subject and ordered a high level intor-

departmental survey.

In response to his personal request

to the DCI, Mir. Helms asked the CI Staff to collect what-

ever information was available through our own sources

and

through liaison with the FBI and to pass it to OCI, which

was directed to prepare a memorandum from the DCI to the

President.

3.

A book message requirement was sent to all stations

to report whatever information was on hand relevant to this

subject. Although agent reports on Comnunist front opera-

tions overseas were i

some value, the primary source of

information on the activities of US activists--and that was

quite limited--was

sensitive intercepts produced by NSA,

which had been similarly tasked by the White llouse.

MEMORANDUM FOR:' DDI

SUBJECT

: Sensitive Activities

1. FBIS has been engaged in no activities related to the Ellsberg

and Watergate cases.

?. FBIS operations occasionally extend to the domestic arena. From

time to time, fbIs linguists are made available to Do or Office of

Conmunications components for special operations (usually abroad) involving

close-support SIGINI work or translation of audio take. On one occasion

recently DDO, on behalf of the FBI, requested the services of several

FBIS linguists skilled in Arabic to work directly for the FBI on a short-

term project here in Washington. The arrangements were made by Mr. Oberg

of the DJO CI Staff.

He said the project was very highly classified and

that FBIS participation

was approved by Mir. Colby and the Director.

FBIS

participation vos. approved by the Director of FBIS after a chect with

the ADDI..

Other examples of sensitive linguistic support nork are help

in the handling and resettlement of irfectors, the recent assignment of

an employce to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to transcribe

recordings in a rare Chinese dialect, and the detailing of another

Chinese linguist on two occasions to

assist in the U.S. military training

of Chinese Nationalist cadets.

3. Within its responsibility for monitoring press agency trans-

missions for intelligence information, FBIS publishes and distributes

some material which falls in a "gray"

area of copyright protection, libel,

and privacy of international communications. Press services controlled

by national governments and transmitted by radiotcletype without

specific addressees, e.g. the Soviet TASS service and the PRC's MCNA,

are monitored by FBIS and the material is disseminated without restric-

tion. The legality of this has been affirmed by decisions of the

4. The routine FBIS monitoring of foreign radio broadcasts often

involves statements or spaeches made by U.S. citizens using those radio

facilities. Examples are statenents nade or allegedly made by American

POW's in Hanoi, by Jane Fonda in Hanoi and by Rarsey Clark in Vietnam.

At the request of FBI and the Department of Justice, and with the

approval of the CIA Office of General Counsel, we have on occasion sub-

mitted transcripts of such broadcasts to the Department of Justice as

part of that Department's consideration of

a possible trial. In such

cases, we have been required to submit nanes of FBIS monitors involved,

presumably because of the possibility they might be required as witnesses.

(In one case in 1971, an FBIS staff employee was directed to appear as

an expert witness in

the court-martial of a Marine enlisted man charged

with aiding the enemy in a bioadcast fron Hanoi.) FBIS vicws all this

with misgivings. Monitoring of such broadcasts is incidental and we

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Science & Technology

SUBJECT

: ISD Support to Other Agencies

1. Technical Services Division's charter (CSI 1-8) requires

that it provide technical assistance to both CIA operations and

other activities as may be directed by the Deputy Director for

Operations.

2. Over the years the chief non-CIA recipients of this

support have been the Department of Defense, the Federal

Burcau of Investigation, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department

of State, United States Postal Service, Secret Service, Agency

for International Development, and the White House.

3. While varying widely among the different recipients, these

services have included training and materials, and in a few in~

stances participation in the fields of audio and visual surveillance,

secret writing and related communications, personal protection,

disguise,

concealment devices, electronic beaconry, illicit narcotics detec-

tion, and counter-sabotage/terrorism.

4. In most instances requirements for this support are

received by TSD through higher echelons (Office of the Director

or Deputy Director for Operations). Unless the service involved

is a trivial or continuing one, the request is

referred to the

Foreign Intelligence Staff Departmental Coordination Group for

coordination and approval at the appropriate Agency levels.

Approval within ISD by the Chief of Operations or Development

and Engineering and the Chief of ISD or his Deputy also is re-

quired.

5. The attachment lists the primary services provided to

the organizations named in Paragraph two.

coordination of the operation. BNDD requests are coordinated

with DDO/NARCOG.

Requests for documentation of Immigration

and Naturalization Service is coordinated via the Alien Affairs

Staff.

9. Authentication items are issued on a loan basis and must

be returned to TSD or accounted for. After any documentation has

been issued, TSD retains photographs and records of such support

until the documentation has been returned to ISD. If the material

is not returned after a reasonable time, the requester is reminded

of the outstanding documentation.

This is an operation with additional

participation by National Security Agency. It is

designed in anticipation of the Identity 64

in Washington. The listening post was

obtained by using

for procuring the property. New systems are

being designed and produced by using ISD's covert

contractor mechanisms and TSD engineers.

(F) Identity 65

- Ten masked audio devices pur -

chased from ISD were installed in Identity 65

by the FBI. Part of the equipment was install-

ed in November and December 1971, the remaining

equipment was installed 17 - 25 March 1972. Tests

made by a TSD officer from a temporary FBI

listening post on 8 - 9 November 1972, proved that

the target equipment no longer functioned and was

believed discovered by the occupants.

(G) TSD has furnished equipment items which constitute

an on-the-shelf capability to engage in photo and

known to the Agency. In one case it is known that a

relatively unsophisticated device was used against

a domestic target.

Contacts with Domestic Police Organizations

1. In December 1968, July 1969 and December 1970, SDB

provided basic countersabotage familiarization training for

selected members of the washington metropolitan area police

departments.

The training was given at the Fairfax County

police pistol and rifle range.

Authorization for the train-

ing came from DDP and Chief, Office of security.

2. On occasion during the past few years, under the

auspices of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of

the Department of Justice and with the approval of CI Staff

and Office of Security, SDB provided training and familiari-

zation to police officers of several domestic police

departments in the uses of the Explosives Residue Detection

These tech-

niques had been declassified and are currently available to

the law enforcement community. The National Bomb Data Center

publishes periodic guidance in their uses.

3. In order to augment the SDB mission responsibilities

in the field of countersabotage and counterterror, SDB Offi-

cers have in the past two years visited, under appropriate

covers, the explosives disposal units of the New York City

police department, Dade County (niami) Florida Dept. and the

Los Angeles Police Dept.

Also, in March 1973, two SDB offi-

cers attended the Explosives and Ordnance Disposal Conference

in Sacramento, California, sponsored by LEAA.

When the

DOMESTIC TESTS FOR

AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

1.: As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the

research and development of equipment and techniques

for Agency applications in foreign intelligence, we

conduct experiments and tests in the United States.

Clearly, the design and development of our intelli-

cquipments can be done more cconomically and

more securely in this country. Although most of

the tests of our RaD equipments are performed in

closed laboratories or in secure arcas simulating

the foreign environment, some of the tests and experi-

ments, of necessity, reveal domestic information.

2. A review of the surveillance equipment or

techniques which have at some time or other been

exposed to domestic testing is as follows:

a. Laser Probe - About 1967, the laser

probe developed by ORD was tested by TSD in

San Francisco under very closely controlled

conditions.

The ORD Project Officer witnessed

portions of the test. Recordings that were

made of laser

probe

output were carciully

controlled as classified material and it is

believed

that

the taues have long since been

destroyed.

Management

• Burglary

1. Attached is a report summarizing what we know about the

reported break-in of Identity 61.

An investigative report

by an officer of the Exccutive Protective Service states that the

offices were ransacked and a number of personal items stolen.

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

2. The attached summary also describes a separate audio

operation conducted against Identity 61

. by the FBI, at the

pchest and with its technical support. This presents a

related question that should be noted. James McCord's' testimony

indicatos that he placed telephone calls to the Identity 75 and Identity

61.

He says he picked the numbers at random, hoping

that if his phone was tapped his attorneys would be able to challenge

the evidence as being tainted.

Another witness, John Caulfield,

says McCord called the two named Iden 75 and Idon 61 because he "was sure"

they "were subjects of national security wirctaps."

3. In fact, there has been a long-standing telephone tap on the

Identity 75

, r'un by the FBI, about which

believes McCord

knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation

against Identity 61

, and assumed that it was also a telephone

tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping

that both his lelephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and

that one way or another his case would be dismissed or dropped

because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive

operations.

At this point, given the publicity of the Iden 61 break-in,

and the lestimony of McCord and Caulfield, the current investigations

may lead to exposure of the operations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Reported Burglary of the Identity 61

1. The press reported a burglary of Identity 61

- 13-14

May 1973. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive

Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked and a

number of personal items were stolen. There were some latent

fingerprints, but no identification was made. The FBI, which states

that the incident was on 15 May, did not investigatc because it

deter-

mined that it did not have jurisdiction. The Identity 61

registered a formal complaint and American regrets were expressed,

Identity 61

making it clear that they suspected something other than

ordinary robbery. We have no additional information on the subject.

There had been an carlier intelligence operation against the Identity 61

which is described below.

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

2. On 10 April 1971

proposed to the FBI the instal-

lation of technical coverage of Identity 61

The opportunily

for such an installation came about when a domestic asset of Foreign

Resources Division reported that he had been asked to submit a bid

for a contract to renovate

Identity 61

Upon securing the

contract the asset was willing to augment his work force as appropriate

or install material which would be provided him

3. On 23 April 1971 FBI Director John Edgar Hoover turned

down the Agency proposal. That same day CIA Director Richard Helms

sent a letter to Attorney-General John Mitchell rcquesting that the FBI

turndown be reversed, citing the importance of the Iden 61 target and

national intelligence needs to collect positive intelligence. On 24 April

the Attorney-General reversed the FBI decision and the Washington

Field Office of the Bureau was instructed to proceed with the operation.

4. During the period from 26 April to 18 May all the

technical equipment from the Agency to the FBI was delivered,

installed and tested. Everything seemed to be working. No Agency.

personnel were involved in any way with actual installation of

equipment in

Identity 61 From May to February Agency tech-

nicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair work on occasions

of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. On no occasion dia

they enter. Identity 61.

5. The Agency requested that coverage of Identity 61 • be

stopped on 3 February 1972 after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

advised that he was scheduled shortly to testify in Congress and

might have to advise them that the installation in Identity 61

was initiated atl

request. The operation and equipment, to the

best of the Agency's knowledge, was dormant until 8 December 1972

when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage. The

request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76

delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on

nationalization of foreign holdings,

While the EBI was still

in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of

State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possible

coverage of Identity 61

and on 22 December 1972 coverage

was partially reinstituted with full coverage in effect by 26 December

1972.

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

6. A review of the lake from the operation, weighed against

the risks involved, led the Agency to conclude that the activity was

not worth continuing. On 16 February 1973 L

requested the & BI

tó discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised

that microphone surveillance of Iden 61

was discontinued.

MEMOR ANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Identity 61

Break In on 15 May 1972

1. On 24 May 1973 I telephoned MI. James Robinson,

General Crime Section, Department of Justice and asked if he

had any information as to criminal prosecution of persons involved

in a break in at Identity 61

• in Washington, D.C. on

15 May 1972. Mr. Robinson stated he had no knowledge of this but

suggested that it would be better to check with Mr. G. Marvin Gentile,

Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security, Department of State, and

the Secret Service since they had responsibilities for the Executive

Protective Service (EPS). I telephoned MI. Gentile and he identi-

fied two State Department cables relative to the incident; one from

the embassy in Santiago to the Department, No. 2450, dated

15 May 1972, Subjcct: Unauthorized Entry Outlining the Protest

of the Iden 76 Covernment presented to the American Emoassy,

and the State Department roply to Santiago, No. 0S4655, dated

15 May 1972. Mr. Gentile also identified the EPS report of

investigation and suggested that I get a copy from the Secret Scrvice.

I then called Mr. Tom Kolly at Secret Service and he had his liaison

man deliver me a copy of the EPS report of investigation.

2. On 25 May 1973 I Icceived a call from FBI Agent

Ray Mullens on green phone No. 5303 stating that he had received

a telephone call from Mi. James Robiason relative to my inquiry

about prosecution. Mr. Mullens indicated that the FBI Washington

Field Office had recontacted the Vietropolitan Police Department (MPD)

on 24 May and reviewed the report No. 218-424 filed with the 3rd

District, MPD which states that a break in occurred at Identity 61

between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. on 15 May 1972.

Reparted loss at tha

and one electric razor.

The police investigation identified

some latent fingerprints bui no identification of those prints

was made. Since the reported loss was under $5, 000 and there

was. no evidence of a crossing of state boundries, the FBI did

not make an investigation of the incident. The MPD reported

that there had baen no prosecution and no suspect was identified.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Mr. William E. Colby

Special Activities

1. Following our recent conversation, I have

searched

my memory and Mr. McCone's files for examples

of activitics which to hostile observors or to soncone

without complete knowlcage and with a spccial kind o1

motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities

exceeding CIA's charter.

2. First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962,

DCI McCone, under

pressure from Attorney General Robert

F. Kennedy, agreed

to tap the telephones of columnists

Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in an cffort to identify

their sources for classified

information which was appcar-

ing in their columns.

Because the primary source appeared

to be in the Department of

Defense, NeConc ordered me

personally to brief Gencral Joe Carroll, Director of DIA,

orally, which

I did. I

understand more

complete infornation

on this operation is available from the Director of security.

I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of

whät piecise actions

were taken, what information was gained,

what was done with it, and when the opcration was terminated.

3. As a rosult of a devcloping relationship with

IDEN-122

and

thelDEN-123representative in Washington,

also as a rosult of certain information convejed by

IDEN-124

, James Angleton, with the approval of

Dick Helms, agreed to mount a

counterespionage operation

against the

IDEN-95

Washington.

This involved

breaking and entering and the removal of documents from

the

IDEN-126

On 18 June 1962, DCI McCone and

Helms briefed

Secretary of State Rusk generally.on the

operation without going into operational details: Later

on the same day, President John F. Kennedy was briefed.

Actual breaking and entering occurred somewhat later, and

on 15 April 1963: DCI McCone met with President Kennedy

alone and briefed the President on the dotails of this

new phase of the operation.

On the same day, the Attorney

General was briefed and he

agiced that he would not

mention it to the FBI unless the FBI therselves raised

it with him. On 3 February 1961, DCI NcCone met alone

with President Lyndon B. Johnson

and briefed him on the

opcration.

On 1 February McGeorge Bundy was briefed.

On 6 February 1964 in a

briefing

of Secretary of State

Rusk on the results

of the opcration, Rusk expressed

rescrvations about the propricty of such an operation.

He rnised this same concern in subsequent conversations

with McCone on 17 April 1961. 28 May 1961: and 14 June

1961. On 12 September 1961 Rusk continued to express

grave leservations and repeatedly suggested that the

IDEN-i3 be informed dirocrly that we know about their

espionage operations

in the

United States and ask them

to desist. In a meeting on 28 May 1961 Rusk expressed

these reservations in the presence of DCI McCone and

President Join F.. Kennedy. Secretary of Defense McNamara

was also

present, and thore is no record

that he had

previously been made aware of this operation.

• 4.

Although certain activities never got beyond

the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples

of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation.

One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice

crops in both Cuba

and North Vietnam. A second involved

a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nucleai instal-

lations.

Outside the United States Government, General

Eisenhower was briefed on such planning.

A third, which

assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by

Angleton and Helms for a greatly

increased intelligence

collection effort against foreign installations in this

country. This planning also involved a scheme for selected

exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the

Soviet intelligence service.

The reasons are still unclear

to me as to why the FBI chose to brief the PrIAB to the

effect that CIA was planning to wiretap extensively and

indiscriminately in this country, to greatly increase

the Agency representation[

and

generally to use KGB-type

tactics, also extensively and

indiscriminately.

This led to a heated exchange between

DCI icCone and Vir. Belmont of the FBI, one such meeting

taking place in the presence of the Attorney General.

It is clear that the IBI was opposed to any such proposal

then, as now, and the plan never went forward..

5. During the period when Des FitzGerald was in

charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI IcCone's office

learned, quite by

accident, that FitzGerald had secured

the coopcration of several prominent US business firms

in denying

economic items to Cuba.

There was no question

but that the businessmen were glad to cooperate, but know-

ledge of this operation had to be rather widespread.

6. On 17 April 1961. Mi. Robor't B. Anderson came

to DCI. NcCone on behalf of Ancrican business interests,

offering to insert some

5300,000 to try to secure a

favorable result in the clections in Panama.

Shortly

after

this approach,

IDEN'-128

of

1DE N-129

made a similar proposal to McCone in connection

with elections in Chile.

On 12 May 1964 at a meeting of

the 303 Committee, it was decided that the offers of

American business could not be

accepted. it being neither

secure way nor an honorable way of doing such business.

This declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent

ITT hearings, but I am not surprised that McCone has

•forgotten that he helped to set the precedent of

refusing

to accopt such collaboration between the Agency's operations

and private business.

7.

At the direction of Attorney General Robert

Kennedy and

with the explicit approval of President Konnedy,

NcCone injected the Agency, and particularly

IDEN- 36

ENES CHLY

into the US labor situation, and particularly to try

to ameliorate the quarrel between George Meany and

Walter

Reuther. IEN-36

stcered a very skillful

course in this connection, but the Agency could be

vulnerable to charges that we went behind deany's back,

or were somehow consorting with Reuther against leany's

wishes.

8. There are three examples of using Agency

funds which I know to be controversial.

One was the

expenditure of money under Project NOSES in securing

the release of Cuban Brigade prisoners.

Details of

this operation are best known to Larly Houston, Mike

Miskovsky

IDEN-131

, and dares Smith.

Second,

as you well know, when Lou

Concin received

his summons

to report to the Joint General Staff Headquarters on

1 Novenber

1963 a large amount of

cash went with him.

My improssion is that the accounting for this and its

use has never

been very frank or complete.

Third, at

one of the

carly Special Group nectings attended by

McCone he took strong exception to proposals to spond

Agency funds to improve the

economic viability of licst

Berlin, and for an investment program in lali. His

gencral position was that such exponditures were not

within the Agency's charter, and that he would allow

such spending only on the direct personal request of

the Secretary of

State or the Secretary of Defense, or

the White House.

9. I raise these issues of funding because I

remember the Agency's being

severely criticized by the

House Appropriations Subcommittce for having spent $3,000

for stamps in connection with a program to buy tractors

to secure the release of prisoners from Cuba.

10. Under the heading of old business, I know that

any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried

about the fact that conversations within the offices and

over the telephones were transcribed.

During McCone's

...

EMS OMY

tenure, there were microphones in his regular office,

his inner office, his dining room, his office in East

Building, and his study at his rosidence on thite haven

Street.

I do not know who would be willing to

raise such

an issue, but knowledge of such opcrations tends to

spread, and cortainly the Agency is vulnerable on this

score.

11. Also under the heading of old business, I

well remember the hue and cry raised, especially by Carl

Kaysen in the White House, when JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

shortly after the cuban missile crisis, there was

a disposition in Washington to reexamino the Bay of Pigs,

and the

fact

that several Alabama National Air Guard

officers lost their lives in the Bay of Pigs was surfaced

with surprisingly little excitement at the time.

12. During my stint on the ith floor there was

a special arrangement with the Office of Communications

Whereby the Director's office gained access to non-cl

traffic.

This surfaced bricfly at one point shortly after

Admiral

Rayborn became DCI.

He had visited the Signal

Center and removed a copy of a telegram fion the Embassy

in the Dominican Republic for Under Secretary George Ball,

Eyes Only.

He returned to his office and procceded to

discuss

this telegram

with George Ball who was naturally

quite curious as to how Rayborn knew about it, and also as

to how Rayborn had it in his possession before Ball did.

Ben Read in the Secretary of Stace's office and I spent

several weeks putting this one to rest.

13. Finally, DCI McCone, as you and I well know,

operated on a very lofty plane,

and

I think certain of

his activitics could be misunderstood: One example was

his decision in July of 1961 to have Aristotle Onassis and

Maria Callas flown from Rome to. Athens

on Air Force KC 135.

Their arrival in Athens in this airplane attracted the

attention of the local press and in

due course dir. John

Hightower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for

Washington, came to see me to ask about the propriety

of this

action.

14. The use of

IDEN-132

aircraft

has been remarkably secure, but DCI lIcCone himself

foigot about the cover arrangement and became quite

exercised when he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the

San Francisco airport for the Republican National Con-

vention in 1961 aboard the

IDEN-133

with

the highly visible tail number IDEN-134. This

was, I

explained to him carerully, a periectly legitimate

charter, but he didn't like it.

15. McCone dealt quite extensively with newsmen

in Washington.

In fact: they gave him a gift and a

luncheon when

he left Washington, which is

perhaps

indicative of the press's relations with him. However,

in the case of the Ross and Wise book, The Invisible

Government, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher

and ine authors to change things.

They did not change

a comma, and I doubt that this old saw willeer sing

again.

16. Finally, and this will reflect my diddle

Western Protestant

upbringing, iccone's dealings with

the Vatican, including

• Pope John XXIII

and Popc Paul

VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.

17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a

sinking feeling that discipline has broken down, and that

allegations from any quarter which cast these things in

• the wiong light would

receive great publicity and attention,

and no amount of denial would

If I may be of any assistance in tracking down further

Project MPLODESTAR is a Headquarters initiated program

which has as its fundamental

objective the long term manipu-

lations of selected agent assets operating against EA Division

difficult targets in the leftist

and communist milieu in various

parts of the world. Although targetted overseas these agents are

often exposed to and directed against American radical, leftist,

and communist targets to gain a practical knowledge of the loftring,

radical, communist world. There is a possibility that an asset

might become suspect and be accused of being an employee of the

Agency or the Bureau; or it might happen sore asset would, for

some reason, become disenchanted with his role and expose his

Agency relationship and his activities, with resultant embar-

rassment. To minimize potential problems, therefore, each

case is cleared with the FBI and through CI/SO the Bureau is

was prompted by a decision that the intelligence production of

this operation did not justify the risks involved in continuing

to run it in the sensitive political climate caused by the

mounting disclosures

about

was especially so because of our reservations about maintaining

proper security for the listening post which, as with other

SUBJECT: Foreign Support For Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

1. There are only linited indications thus far of

foreign efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of

activitics designed to disrupt or harass the National

Convention of the Republican Party in San Diego, 21-23

August 1972.

Some American participants at the Soviet-controlled

World Assembly for Peace and Indeyendence of the Peoples of

Indochina, held 11-13 February 1972 in Paris/Versailles,

attempted

unsuccessiully to include a call tor international

demonstrations to take place at the time

of the Republican

National Convention. A representative of the San Diego

• Convention Coalition (SDCC), one of the domestic action

groups targetting on the

Republican Convention, requested

the Anerican Delegations' Steering Committee at the World

Assembly to include a specific call for international

support of activities against the Republican convention

in their proposal to the Iction Commission of the World

Assembly. This request, however, was

dropped as

too

divisive by the Steering Committce, despite initial indica-

tions that the proposal would be taken to the floor of

the Assembly.

3.

John LENNON, a British

subject, has provided

financial support to

Project "YES", which in

tuin paid

•the travel expenses to the World Assembly of

a representa-

tive of leading antivar activist Rennie DAVIS. (DAVIS' repre-

sentative is tentatively planning to assist in preparations

for disruptive actions

at

the San Diego Convention.)

Project "YES" is an adjunct to another LENNON-supported pro-

ject,

the Election Year Strategy Information Center (EYSIC),

of which Ronnie DAVIS is a key leader, which was

direct New Left protest activities at

set up to

the Republican

representative

to the World Assembly met at least once with

Forcign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

Indications. remain limited, thus far, of foreign efforts

to inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed

to disrupt

or harass the National Convention of the Republican

_Party in San Diego, 21-23 August 1972. The concept of coordinated

international support for domestic activities in the United

States was generally endorsed at the recent World Assembly for

Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina; however, the

Conference issued no spocific call

for international support of

disruptive actions at the American national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace and

Independence of

che Peoples of Indochina, held in Versailles

Irom 10-1s Lebruary 1912, there las mention o1 anerican plans

for demonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic

National Conventions. The final draft resolution from the

Conference's "Action

Commission"

contains an appendix submitted

by American delegates whose goal was

to secure global coordination

for domestic actions in the United States. It calls for inter-

national support to six wecks of domestic antivar actions and

demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with

the statement:

"This

campaign will lead up

to the Democratic

Paxty. Convention at Miami

on July 9, 191z, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly for the

Peacc and Independence of the Indochinese People" of

13 February

1972; drafted by the "Political Commission" states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest against

the war is voiced more and more strongly, under various

torms, such

as draft evasions, desertions, resistance, demon-

strations which now affect even the soldiers.

The Assembly

calls for support to these progressive and

antiwar forces in

the United States, and asks

the

governnents

to grant asylum

to deserters and to support their right to repatriation.

All together, the peoples of the world will efficiently

hein

to inpose on the U.S. Governnent the restoration of peacc

and

independence and freedom in Vietnan, Laos, and Cambodia."

There is little now evidence of foreign plans or efforts

to inspire, support, or take

designed to

disrupt or

harass the Republican National Convention in San

Diego, 21 to 23. August 1972.

tion of North Vietnamese contact with the SDCC; such contact

will be required for the SDCC to implement its carlier-reported

plans for broadcasts over public address systems during the

Convention of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in

Paris.

DEVELOPMENTS:

At its recent convention in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

held 30 March to 2 April 1972, the Students for a Democratic

Socioty (SDS) adopted a proposal

to hold demonstiations at

the San Diego-Tijuana border during the Republican National

Convention.

The proposal included

a call for SDS to coopernie

with Mexican workers

and students in an action to occur during

a fiesta in Tijuana, where Convention delegates will be

entertained.

The North Vietnamese have given their endorsement to

the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC)

in the form of a

letter from the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the

Ámerican

• People (VCSWAP), a

quasi-official organ of

North Vietnamese Government.

the

The letter, which has been

circulated by the SDCC and is dated 27 January 1972,

expresses "great delight" with the formation of the

SDCC

and conveys the Committce's "best wishes of militant soii-

darity and friendship." The VCSWAP requests

that the

SDCC

write often and "send us materials you have."

of the bombing in

ietnam are being organi:

by the "Repub-

lican Party National Convention Coalition" to occur on

21 August 1972.

In an apparent reference to the 21 August

actions, the PCPJ leader added that representatives of the

Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will speak on the subject of

the alleged American bombing of dikes in North Vietnam.

(Comment: We have no present infornation concerning plans of

Stockholm Conference representatives to travel:to the United

States during the

Republican

National Convention; nor do we

have any additional information concerning plans of Stockholm

Conference representatives to participate in activities con-

nected with

the Republican Convention.)

The Anti-lar Union (ANU), a domestic group engaged in

organizing counter-activities

at the Republican National Con-

vention, has sponsored the travel of a delegation of activists

to Paris, France,

to meet with officials of

the Denocratic

Republic of

Jorth Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolu-

#tionary Government of south Vietnam (PRG) ta

An advance party

has already net with DRV and PRG representatives to discuss

the agenda for meetings with the full AnU delegation.

Although

no infornation is presently available indicating

that actions

at the Republican Convention have been discussed or are sched-

uled to be discussed at mectings

between the Aw delcgation

and the DRY/PRo officials, it is Inown that menbers of

the aud

advance party have aslied for advice from the PRG officials

regarding the stance

the AiU should take

relating

on certain questions

to the presidential elections.

It is also known

that

the

DRV officials have questioned the AlU advance party

about the political mood in the United States.

One of the

AlU delcgation. members

has

stated that upon their return to

the United States about 26 July 1972, some of the members

will speak at rallies, over the radio, and on tclevision,

to "educate the American people about the consequences oi

voting for dixon, and the need to end the war and defeat

Nixon."

The delegation member added that the demonstrations

•at-the Republican Convention will be "unique."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY:

There are no new indications of specific foreign plans or efforts to

inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designca to disrupt or

harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-24 August

1972. Although mectings have been held rocently in Paris, France, between

Amcrican antiar activists and representatives of the Democratic Republic

of North Vietriam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of

South Victnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the

DRV/PRG officials mace no efforts to encourage or give guidance to the

American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National

Convention. Private discussions, separate from the meetings with the entire

American delegation, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials;

at present, we have no information regarding the substance of these private

exchanges. A sccond group of activists, considered more important than

the first delegation, is scheculed to travel to Paris on or about 1 August 1972

for further consultations with the PRG and DRV representatives.

DEVELOP.IENTS:

In recent meetings in Paris, France, with members of an American

deligation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (AWU), representatives of

the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary

Government of South Victnam (PRG) were very guarded with respect to dis-

cussing activities at the Republican National Convention. Although the Vietnam-

ese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar

movement in the United States, they made no direct reference to the Repub-

lican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen

Van TIEN accused President Nixon of using the private and public sessions

of the Paris peace talks as "propaganda for the Republican Convention."

TIEN then urged the Americans to promote and propagandize the Seven

Point Plan offered by the PRG. The Americans, too, for the most part,

refrained from discussing the Convention, other than to estimate that demon-

strators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.

CEMIROUAEE DISSEMI

Following their meeting on 22 July 1972 with the AWU delegation,

the PRG officials held additional talks with sub-groups of the delegation.

Additionally, at least one of the American participants was invited by

the DRV officials to return for further discussions. At present, there

Is no information available concerning the substance of these private

exchanges.

A second, more important delegation of Americans connected with

the Anti-War Union is scheduled to travel to Paris circa 1 August 1972

for further consultation with DRV and PRG representatives. This second

group is scheduled to be led by Rennie DAVIS, founcier and leader of the

AWU. This will be DAVIS' second trip to Paris within recent months for

discussions with DRV and PRG representatives. Upon his return from

his first trip, DAVIS publicly stated that the AWU would demonstrate at

both the Democratic and the Republican Convention, but that the AWU's

chief target would be the Republican Convention.

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt

Or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUR MARY AVD CONCLUSION:

There are no direct indications thus far of foreign

efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of

activities

designed to disrupt or harass the National Convention of

the Denocratic varty In Miant, 10-1s July 1912.

The concept

of coordinated

international support for domestic activities

in the United States was generally endorsed at the recent

World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples

of. Indochina; however, the Conference issued no specific

call for international support of disruptive actions

at the

Anerican national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At. the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace

and Independence of the Peoples' of Indochina, held in

Versailles from 10-13 February 1972, there was

mention of

American plans for demonstrations at both the Republican

and Democratic lational

Conventions.

The final draft

resolution from the conference's "Action Commission" con-

tains an

appendix subaitted by Ancrican delcgates whose

goal was to socure global coordination for domestic actions

in the United States.

It calls for international support

to six wecks of domestic antivar actions and demonstrations,

from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with the state-

ment: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic Party

Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in. San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly

for the Peace and Independence of the Indochinese People"

of 13 February 1972, drafted by the "Political Commission"

states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest

against the war is voiced more and more strongly,

under. various forms, such as draft

evasions,

desertions, resistance, demonstrations which

now affect even the soldiers.

The Assembly

calls for support to. these progressive and

antiwar forces in the United States, and asks

the governments to grant asylum to deserters

and to support their right to repatriation.

All together, the peoples of the world will

efficiently help to inpose on the U.S. Govern-

ment the restoration of

peace, independence

and freedon in Vietnah, Laos and Cambodia."

2 yarose, he linerate attende one dia member of 10-15

Secictariat of the Stockholm Corference on

Vietnam of a

statement previously issued by the World Assembly for Peace

and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina.

The Assembly's

pronouncement generally endorsed the concept of internationai

support to a campaign of anti-Vietnam lar activities in the

United States Icading up to the Democratic and Republican

conventions, but made no spechlic call for support of dis-

ruptive actions at the conventions themselves.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In early April 1972 an influontial and well-informed

staff member of the Stocdoln Conference on Vietnam discussed,

in private, the international anti-Vietnam lar activities

conducted

on 1, 15, and 22 April.

The Stockholm Conference

member stated that

these actions were part of an international

campaign in support o1 domestic American

antivar ciforts

during the period 1 Apiil to 15 Nay 1972, and "will culminate

at the election conventions in July and August."

The World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the

Peoples of Indochina, of which the Stockholm Conference was

a major organizer, had carlier

enunciated a similar statement

in an appendix to

the final draft resolution of the Assembly's

"Action Commission." The appendix called for international

support to six weeks of domestic antivar actions

and demon -

strations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concluded with

the statement:

"This campaign will lead up

to the Democratic

Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican

Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

MEMORANDUM FOR :: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT

: Areas of Possible Embarrassment

to the Agency

1. Sometime in the spring or early summer of 1971, Mr. John

Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to

the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request was

non-specific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with

the possible adverse publicity thai might develop regarding the

President's nephew, who was employed by lOs.

2. There were multiple channels from the White House to the

Agency on this subject:

a. Presumably Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director

Helms.

b. Someone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI,

General Cushman (sce attached telephone conversation).

Note that Ehrlichman is mentioned, and

C.

John Dean to the CI Staff.

These various channels

were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by

the CI Staff to Mr. Fred Fielding for Mr. John Dean.

3. The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since

it gives the flavor of White House concern.

It took several days to

uncover the fact that the White House intorest centered on the involve-

ment of the President's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity.

The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were

coordinated with the DCI. After a few months, interest in this sub-,

ject died down and we did not pursue it further.

" 4. Please return the attachments when they have served your

purpose.

5. I also include a short note on the Intelligence Evaluation

Committee and Staff prepared by Richard Ober.

The original

meetings were held in the office of John Dean at the White House

and the principal sparkplug for this group activity was the then

Assistant Attorncy General for Internal Security, Robert Mardian

and then later his assistant, William Olsen. It is noted that Mi.

Mardian is now appearing before the Grand Jury andit is always

possible that he might draw in the Agency. •

6. Before appointing Ober to the IES Staff as the Agency

representative, I had attended various inter-agency mectings pre-

sided over by Mardian. I expressed the view to Director Helms

that Mardian would require very careful handling due to his inex-

perience.

Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split

between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. On a confidential basis

one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly

passing files to Mardian without Mi. Hoover's permission. This

was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from

the Bureau.

SUBJECI: The MHCHAOS Program

1. The MHCHAOS program is a worldwide program for

clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign

efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic

U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China,

North Vietnam,

the Soviet Union, Noith Korea and the

Arab fedayeen.

2. - The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct-

ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection

purposes. Agency efforts arc foreign. Foreign-oriented

activity in the United States has been of two types:

a .

Selected FBI domestic

sources who travel

abroad in connection with their extremist activity

and/or affiliations

make

contact with hostilc

foreign powers or with forcign cxtremist groups

have

been brieled

and debriefed by Icadquarters

officers.

The

bracting has included appropriate

operational guidance, including defensive advice.

b. Americans with existing extremist creden-

tials

have been assessed, recruited, tested and

dispatched abroad for PCS assignnents as contract

agents

primarily sources offered for such use by

the FBI.

When

abroad they collcct intormation re-

sponsive to MUCILOS program requirements, as well

as other Agency icquircments.

They are thus used

primarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Con-

munists, the North Vietnamese, etc., as their back-

ground and their particular access permits.

It

should be noted that the UPTROIkl aspoct of the

MPLODESTAR project of the

East Asia Division is

similar to the MICHAOS PROGRAM.

3. As indicated earlier, MCHAOS is a foreign pro-

gram, conducted overseas, except for the limited activity

described above. The program

is

and

has been managed so

as to achieve the maximum

feasible utilization of exist-

ing resources of the Operations Dircctorate.

program.

Instead, emphasis has

been placed on the exploi-

tation

of new and

old agency assets who have a by-product

capability or

a concurrent capability for provision ot

information responsive to the program's requirements.

This has involved

the provision of custom-tailored collec-

tion requirements

and

operational guidance.

This collec-

tion program is viewed as an integral part of the recruit-

ment and

collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam

Uperations, Cuban Operations, Soviet Bloc Division opera-

tions and Korean Branch operations.

Agents who have an

American

"Movement" background or who have known connec-

tions with the

American

"Movement" are useful as access

agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis-

cern possible vulncrabilities and susccptibilitios; and

to develop operationally exploitable relationships with

recruitment targets of

the abore prograns.

These assets

targets because of their connec-

tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."

over the course of the MichAos program, there

have been

approximatoly 20 important areas of operational interest

which at the present time have been reduced to about ton:

Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers,

Moxico City, Santiago, Ottawa and Hong Kong.

4. The MUCILOS program also utilizes audio opera-

tions,

two of which have

been implemented to cover

tar-

gets

of special

interest.

Paragraph a. deleted because it reveals a sensitive

foreign operation.

Paragraph b. deleted because it reveals a sensitive

Agency foreign operation.

5. MHCHAOS reporting from abroad relating to the

program originates in two ways: Individuals who are noted

in contact with Cubans, the Chinese Communists, etc., and

who appear to have extremist connections, interests

background are reported upon. Other individuals are ro-

ported upon in response to specific Headquarters require-

ments received from the FBI because such individuals are

of active investigatory security interost to the FBI.

All cable and dispatch traffic related to the

MHCHAOS program is sent via

restricted channels. It is

not processed by either the Cable Socretariat or the In-

formation Services Division. The control and retricv-

ability of infornation obtained, including information

received from the FBI, is the responsibility of the spe-

cial Opcrations Group.

7. Information responsive to specific FBI requiro-

ments is disseminated to

the FBI via special controlled

dissemination channels, i.c., by restricted handling cable

traffic or via special pouch

and specially numbered blind

memoranda.

8. Information of particular significance, when col-

lectod, has been disseminated by spocial menorandun over

the signature of the Director of Contral Intclligence to

the White liouse (Di. Kissinger and John Dean), as well as

to the Attorney General, the Socrotary of State and the

Director of the FBI.

a. Question: Do we recruit Americans?

Answer: Yes, we recruit Americans to be

-

used as academic support assots and access agents.

Thesc Americans are used for spotting and assess-

d. Question: What is the arrangement re recruiting

out of colleges? Any clearances or prohibitions?

Answer: As of now CSI 50-10 specifically

requires approval by the. ADDO or DDO for any

recruitment attempt made in the United Siates

against an American member of the academic

community or a loreign target attending an American

academic institution. This regulation is presently in

the process of revision in thai this approval authority

for academic recruitments in the United States is to

be delegated to Chief, ER. The approval authority

for recruitment attempts against American students

outside the United States is to be delegated to the Chief

of the appropriate area division. The only prohibitions

at the present time are those precluding iccruitment

attempts against foreign students here in tlie United States

on grants from Ford Foundation, Rockefeller or Fulbright.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT:

Foreign Resources Division Operational

Activities with Possible Flap Potential

1. At thr risk of stating the obvious, almost all of the operational

activities carried on by FR Division in the United States run the risk

that unauthorized disclosure could create embarrassment to the Agency.

We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with

our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under

the circumstances. There are cortain rather unusual activities in which

FR Division has participated and/or is participating that contain some-

what gicater possibility for embarrassment if discovcied. I have listed

these below, not necessarily in order of embarrassment potential:

JEK Act 6 (1) (B)

a.

provides a fairly considerable

amount of support to Di. Kissinger in his contacts with the

Chinesc. This support was authorized by Mr. Karamessines

and Mr.

Helms. Thus far there has been no problem other

than the inordinate amount of time spent by

personnel, not to mention the fairly sizeable amount of

money that has been espended in support of these efforts.

b. A CIA Officer

is to be assigned to ER Division.

CIA Officer is presently assigned overseas

under deep

cover;

The

In discussions between

NOCAD and the ADDO, it was decided that the Officer

would

be pulled out

and reassigned in the United States.

FR Division was directed to accept this officer for assignment.

12!

We have concluded that the best solution is to have this

officer attend a university in the Midwest for at least

a year, working towards an advanced degree until there

has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan

to make no operational use of tie CIA Officer viatsoever,

during the period of time that he is attending the university.

Upon completion of his year's study, we will review the .

situation and decide the nest course of action at that time.

:

Paragraph 1. c. is deleted because it contains sensitive

Agency operational methods and techniques.

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

d. FR Division has been briefed in general on the

existence of an audio opcration done by the FBI

In San Francisco. This operation is directed

against

IDEN- 62.

I understand the opcration has

been excoptionally well done.

However. the responsibility

for this activity has come from

in conjunction.

with SB Division.

e. Three microphones were planted in various locations

in the

IDEN-61

by the FBI.

The operation was

deactivated and is presently dormant.

The mikes, however,

are still in place. If discovered the operation could cause

some embarrassment to the American Government, but it is

unlikoly the finger would point to ClA.

VIII. Coordination

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

A.

• Internal .

In developing its cadre of general support assets

and access agents, the FR Division maintains close contact

with the

of the Directorate for

Intelligence, using their assets wherever and

whenever

possible to support FR's operational activities.

To a

more linited degree, FR Bases maintain contacts with Office

of Security and Office of Personnel field representátives,

pursuing the occasional leads surfaced by these officers

and using their entre to specific individuals who can

provide access to targets of operational interest.

B. External

FR officers

in the field maintain coordination with

their FBI counterparts. There is limited cooperation

with Bureau offices on internal security cases involving

Soviet and Bloc officials and the local FBI offices are

of occasional help in operations involving other nationals.

The local

field offices of the FBI are made aware of the

presence of FR officers

in their jurisdictions and have on

occasion provided backstopping on cases where there was.

some flap potential.

Coordination with the FBI of FR Division's agent

recruitment activity is governed by an agreement between

the Agency and the FBI dated 7 February 1966.

The Bases

also have contact with local Immigration

and Naturalization Service offices although these contacts

are less frequent and less important than the contacts

with the FBI offices.

allow for the withholding of information related solely to the

internal personnel rules and practices of an agency; inter-

agency or intra-agency documents not available through discovery

proceedings during litigation; information which would constitute

an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of another

individual; and information which would disclose the identity

of a confidential source.

The other file pertains to an invostigation concerning

a threat against your life.

Although your name is carried in

the title throughout the

file as the "victim," only a minimal

amount of information refers to you.

The file indicates that

the Denver Police Department received information that a

particular individual

was in Denver to kill you if you were

elected as United States Senator from Colorado on November 5,

1974; that the polls indicated you would be elected; that you

and your Denver Office were aware of this threat; that the

Denver Police Department afforded protection for you until you

departed Denver the morning of Novenber 6, 1974, for vacation

in Mexico; and that an Agent of this Bureau attempted to see

you to display a phocograph of the suspect, but was advised

Senator Huddleston is identical with subject of

Bufiles 166-5980, 94-67291, and 94-1-676-300. Huddleston

was contacted by

Bureau liaison to offer any assistance

Huddleston's Executive Assistant called the Congressional

Speaker granted.

Huddleston was alleged to have taken a

bribe of $15,000 while he was a State Senator in Kentucky.

Several persons approached him to find out if they could

establish a bank charter.

His supposed reply was that this

could be accomplished for a certain amount of money.

the FBI by laws of Congress, directives of the President, and

orders of the Attorney General.

The remainder of these more than 6,500,000 files

include:

(1)

Personnel files regarding FBI applicants.and

employees;

(2)

General files regarding FBI contacts and

dealings with a variety of individuals and

organizations concerning matters that do

not require or involve FBI investigation; and

; (3)

Administrative-type files, such as those of a

policy nature, those containing statistical

reports, those detailing FBI cooperative

services, and the like.

An unknown, but extremely small, percentage of

these more than 6,500,000 FBI files contain information

regarding present or former Congressmen anã Senators which

mays have been accumulated prior to, during, or after their

tenure in Congress.

WHAT FBI FILES CONTAIN ON CONGRESSMEN:

FBI Files contain substantially the same types of

information regarding Senators and Congressmen

as is contained

in them about other citizens.

Basically this information falls

into the following categories:

Violations of Law

(1)

Allegations that Congressmen or Senators have

violated Federal. laws within the FBI's jurisdiction.

The FBI investigates such allegations whether they

relate to Members of Congress or any other person.

The

results of these investigations are furnished to United States

Attorneys and/or other prosecutive officials of the Department

of Justice. The investigation may establish (a) that the

Congressnan or Senator has, in

fact, violated a Federal law,

(b)

that a Federal law has been violated, but that the involve-

ment of the Congressman or Senator in that violation cannot be

established, (c) that a Federal law has been violated, but

that the Congressman or Senator clearly had no involvement

in its violation, or (d) that no violation of Federal law

was committed.

Included among such allegations involving Congress-

men and Senators have been the following types of violations

within the FBI's jurisdiction: Bank Fraud and Embezzlement;

Conflict of Interest; Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; Election

Laws; Fraud Against the Government; and Interstate Transporta-

tion

in Aid of

Racketeering.

(2) Violations of Federal laws within the FBI's

jurisdiction involving Congressmen and Senators as victims.

The results of FBI investigations of such violations

are furnished to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecu

tive officials of the Department of Justice.

In many instances,

the original complaint in these cases is received from the law

maker-victim himself; however, if the information originates

elsewhere, the FBI promptly notifies the Congressman or. Senator

involved of the threat which has been made.

In addition; other

law enforcement agencies which have a legitimate interest in

these cases are notified of the threat.

Violations of the Congressional Assassination, Kid-

naping and Assault Statute, Bomb Threats, and Extortion are

among the crimes within the

FBI's jurisdiction which have

involved lawmakers as victims.

(3) Allegations that members of the staffs of

Congressmen or Senators have violated Federal laws within the

FBI'S

jurisdiction, or that these staff members have been

victims of such violations.

The FBI investigates such allegations and furnishes

the results to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecutive

officials of the Department of Justice. Where appropriate, the

Congressman or Senator involved is also advised of the investi-

gation.

Congressmen and Senators may be interviewed by the

FBI in these cases involving Congressional aides--just as they

may be interviewed in connection with other types of FBI

investigations--and both the fact of, and the results of,

such interviews are noted in the file reflecting the FBI

investigation.

(4) Allegations that Senators cr Congressmen have

violated laws within the jurisdiction of other investigative

agencies.

These allegations are brought to the attention of

the agency concerned--Federal, state, or local. Such allega-

tions are not investigated by the FBI. However, the coopera-

tive services of the FBI Laboratory, Identification Division,

and National Crime Information Center are available to other

law enforcement agencies in the investigation of these, as

well as other, crimes.

Applicant Investigations

(5)

Present and former Congressmen and Senators

often are considered for positions in the Executive or

o of the boat

Judicial Branches of the Federal Government which require

that the FBI conduct a thorough background investigation

of them.

Dependent, upon the nature of the position involved,

the results of these investigations are furnished to the White

House, the Department of Justice, and/or other appropriate

Government agencies.

(6) Congressmen and Senators often are interviewed

in the course of applicant-type investigations regarding

other persons who are being considered for Executive or

Judicial positions--as well as during applicant-type investi

gations conducted by the FBI (at the request of the Committee

chairman involved) concerning staff members of a limited

Security Cases

(7). Either prior to, during, or subsequent to their

tenure in Congress, there may be files pertaining to security-

type matters which

• relate to members of

the House and Senate,

or Congressmen may be identified in FBI files as actual or

intended victims of acts by subjects of security-type cases.

The Statutes covering such matters are Title 18, Section 2383

Conspiracy), and Title 18, Section 2385 (Smith Act -

Advocating overthrow of Government by force).

oral or Written Contact

(8) An unknown number of FBI files contain copies

of correspondence between the FBI and Congressmen and Senators

concerning a wide variety of matters which include bills

pending in, or passed by,

Congress; personnel matters; the

Bureau's cooperative services; and FBI policies, procedures,

and investigations. Many of these letters from Congressmen

and Senators have been prompted by inquiries which these

lawmakers have received from constituents or other interested

citizens.

The FBI's files also contain memoranda regarding

telephone calls and personal contacts the FBI has had with

Congressmen and Senators regarding the above-cited variety

of matters.

Miscellaneous Information About Congressmen

(9) An unknown number of FBI files contain informa-

tion reflecting favorably or unfavorably upon the character,

integrity, and loyalty of Senators and Congressmen--which

information does not require investigative action at the time

received on the part of the FBI or other law enforcement

• agencies. It consists of:

(a) Information contained in unsolicited letters

received by the FBI from persons and organi-

zations representing a variety of backgrounds,

viewpoints, and walks of life.

(b)

Information volunteered orally to FBI Agents by

the same broad range of individuals and organi.-

Fingerprints of Congressmen

(10 )

The files of the Identification Division

contain the fingerprints of an unknown number of Senators

and Congressmen.

Some of these relate to their having been

arrested for violations of Federal, state, or local laws.

Others are noncriminal in origin and largely pertain to

their having served in the Armed Forces or having been appli-

cants for various positions. These fingerprint cards have

been submitted to the FBI by Federal agencies, as well as by

local, county, and state criminal justice agencies, throughout

the United States.

Fingerprint records are maintained by the FBI's

Identification Division, and they are kept entirely separate

and apart from all other files and records of the FBI.

HOW INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN REACHES FBI FILES:

There are two basic types of information regarding

Congressmen and Senators in FBI

files:

(1) Information which the FBI has solicited during

investigations involving the Congressman or Senator as either

a subject or a victim.

This includes information of

pertinence to the case which the lawmaker himself has

furnished to the FBI.

(2) Unsolicited Information.

there are many sources of the unsolicited information

that is included in FBI files:

(a)

It is volunteered by citizens who are being

interviewed during investigations of matters

having no relationship to any of our Nation's

lawmakers.

(b)

It is volunteered in communications sent to the

FBI by individuals and organizations.

(c) It is included in news articles and

other reports

publicly disseminated by our Nation's news media

which come to the FBI's attention.

(2)

It is received from FBI confidential informants

and, very infrequently, from telephone taps not

directed at a Congressman which have been

installed with authority of a Federal Court

and/or authority of the Attorney General.

(e) In the case of information contained on finger-

print cards, it is sent to the FBI's Identifica-

tion Division by authorized contributors,

including criminal justice agencies throughout

the United States.

HOW AND WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN IS MAINTAINED:

Information regarding Congressmen anâ Senators is

included in the official FBI files--totaling more than

6,500,000 in number--that are maintained by the Files and

Communications Division on an upper floor of the J. Edgar

Hoover FBI Building.

The area where these files are maintained is staffed

and supervised 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assure

continuous security.

General Index

The essential key to the effective use of these FBI

files is the Bureau's General Index which consists of 58

million index cards and which is located on a different floor

from the files themselves in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building.

To determine what files (if any at all) contain information

regarding an individual Senator or Congressman, it is

necessary to search the name of that lawmaker in the General

The General Index is staffed and supervised 24 hours

a day, Y days a week, to assure continuous security.

Rules Governing Use of Files

These official FBI files are available only to FBI

personnel--and they are available on a "need-to-know" basis

only.

The Files and Communications Division maintains a

record of files that have been charged out by Headquarters

personnel.

such files must be returned to the Files and

Communications Division as soon as possible; and during the

period that a file is chaiged out, it cannot be left even

momentarily in an unlocked room.

If retained overnight,

the file must be kept in a locked cabinet inside a locked

room.

55108 DooId:32989624 Page 213

---

## Page 214

The charge-out record is temporary in nature and

is destroyed five days after the file has been returned to

the Files and Communications Division.

WHY THE FBI RETAINS INFORMATION REGARDING CONGRESSMEN:

The information regarding Congressmen and Senators

that is maintained in FBI files can be divided into three

major categories:

(1) The results of investigations (criminal-,

security, and applicant-type) involving a Congressman or

Senator as a subject or victim;

(2) Intormation regarding a Congressman or senator--

in adaition to that gathered during investigation(s) of the

12 to

lawmaker involved-which the FBI has disseminated to other

Federal agencies (such as to the Internal Revenue Service if, for

example, the information involves a tax-related matter) and/or to

state and local law enforcement agencies (such as the police

department covering the lawmaker's home community if, for example,

the information involves an alleged threat against the lawmaker's

house or other property; and

(3). Other information that. the FBi receives from,

or receives about,

a Congressman or Senator that is included

in the FBI's files--without having been either investigated

or disseminated by the FBI.

The reasons this information is retained in FBI

files can be explained in legal and administrative terms,

as well as in practical terms.

Legal and Administrative Reasons

All investigative files and other records of the

FBI involving Congressmen.or Senators are within a class

of records which-under the FBI Records Retention Plan

developed in 1969 by the National Archives and Records

Service of the General Services

Administration-are con-

sidered of enduring archival value to ensure their preser-

vation.

This FBI Records Retention Plan was prepared under

the authority contained in the Federal Records Act of 1950,

which is contained in Title 44 of the United States Code.

-7-

NH 55108 DocId: 32989624 Page 214

## Page 215

Included among the FBI records to be retained

under the Records Retention Plan formulated by the National

Archives and Krcords Service are those which would have

historical value and would document policies, procedures,

functions, legislative and budget matters, and the like--

and reports of investigations of both civil and criminal

activities, including "crimes involving,

and other recoras,

concerning, the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the

United States, members of and delegates elected to the

Congresses of

the United States, cabinet heads, judges and

other officials appointed by the President.

In 'stablishing the FBI Records Retention Plan,

the National Archives and Records Service noted, "Ordinarily

the records of a Federal agency that are worthy of permanent

retention amount to a sather small percentage of the total

volume of records generated.

Many of the records produced

by the Federal. Bureau of Investigation, however, relate to

a number of controversial if not important aspects of the

history of the United States, particularly to the role of

the Federal Government in its relation to its citizens.

To be sure,

many years will pass before these records can

be made available to the public for historical and other

serious research. Nevertheless, the archival value of these

records will not decrease nor will interest in them dissipate."

In addition, the FBI is also required by the

Fedecal Records Act 'to make records containing adequate and

proper documentation of its administration and operations

which, among other things, are designed to furnish

informa-

tion necessary to protect the legal and financial interest

of the Governient and of persons directly affected by FBI

activities.

Practival Reasons for Retaining Information

Logic, reason, and lessons learned from more than

six decades o! law enforcement experience dictate that the

FBI should maintain records of investigations it has conductea

(category #I cited at the top of page 7) and records of

information it has disseminated to other agencies (category #2

on page 7).

Such records enable the FBI to answer questions or

challenges (including those arising in judicial or administra-

tive proceedins) involving investigations FBI Agents have

conducted and, vr information the FBI has disseminated to other

HH 55108 DooId:32989624 Page 215

## Page 216

sort witt the bed

→ are saa

agencies.

Such records also enable the FBI to furnish additional

copies of investigative reports or other information that has

been disseminated--should additional copies be needed by the

original recipients or by other official agencies.

Furthermore,

the information contained in these files often proves of

assistance in future investigations.

Less obvious may be the reasons why the FBI retains

the third category of information about Congressmen and

Senators (data that has neither been investigated nor

disseminated by the FBI) cited on page 7.

If such information is of an administrative nature--

that is, if the information indicates the lawmaker is interested

in a specific FBI investigation, a specific area of the FBI's

jurisdiction, or specific FBI policies, practices anã procedures--

it is filed for:

(1) the information and advice of FBI employees in

connection with future contacts or correspondence with that

Congressman or Senator;

(2) consideration "of FBI personnel in connection

with possible future changes in FBI policies, practices, and

procedures.

If the information is of a personal nature--that is,

if it reflects upon the loyalty, character, or integrity of a

lawmaker--it is included in FBI files for the following reasons:

(1) The information may prove of value when a

• present or former Congressman or Senator is considered for

a position in the Executive or Judicial Branch of Government

which requires that the FBI conduct a background investiga-

• tion of him.

(2) The information could prove of value in

solving future crimes committed against the Congressman or

Senator-or against members of that lawmaker's family.

(A person who berates and defames a lawmaker would be

logical suspect if that lawmaker-or another Congressman

or Senator whose views coincide with his--becomes the

target of actual or threatened violence.)

(3) The information could aid the FBI in solving

crimes committed against other persons. (For example, the

handwriting, typewriting, stationery, and/or distinctive

the FBI in linking the writer of that letter to a subsequent

(4) The information frequently provides valuable.

insight into the character, stability, and reliability of

the person who has furnished it to the FBI. Thereby, it is

of value and assistance to the FBI in future contacts with,

contacts by, or inquiries regarding, this individual.

(5) The information provides a useful administra-

tive check on the performance of FBI field offices--

particularly with regard to the important consideration of

whether they are being fully responsive to the public needs.

Supervisory personnel regularly review complaints or

allegations received from the public to insure that the

appropriate action was taken--if, in fact, action was called

for.

WHAT IS REQUIRED TO DESTROY FILE INFORMATION:

Barring a new law of Congress and/or receipt of

revised FBI Records Retention Plan from the National Archives

and Records Service, the FBI cannot unilaterally undertake

the destruction of information regarding Congressmen and

Senators in its files.

This memorandum recommends that the Director raise the

question of privacy and source protection with Senators of the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the occasion of his anticipated

meeting in Executive Session with the SSC tentatively scheduledd

for the week of 7/14/75.

By letter dated 7/9/75, Senators Frank, Church and

John Tower of SSC requested the Attorney General and the

Director to appear before the Committee in Executive Session

during the week of 7/14/75.

The purpose of this meeting is

discuss the matter of concern to Mr. Kelley and steps which

might be taken to expedite the response to requests for documents!

essential to the Committee inquiry.

The Senstudy staff of the Intelligence Division is

preparing for the Director's use copies of each of the written

requests received from SsC annotated with the dates of our

response to each request; the date it was delivered to the

Department; and the date it was delivered to the SSC staff.

There remains, however, a serious problem precipitated

by three recent written

requests

of the SSC dated 6/30/75 (received

by the Bureau on 7/7/75); 7/1/75 (received by the Bureau on

7/8/75); and 7/8/75 (received by the FBI on 7/9/75). All three

of these requests appear, in part,

to disregard the privacy of

certain individuals or requests

the identity of sources

cooperating with the FBI.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY '75

In this regard, in an exchange of letters dated

Colby in his role as the Director

of Central Intelligencé, wrote to Senator Church stating.

that "I am particularly appreciative of your recognition

that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence activities

must receive special consideration and treatment by the Select

Committee in the course of your work.

As we discussed, such

matters as the identities oi our sensitive sources. . ..:

should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed iron

the risk of exposure. 'We should'

also work

together to protect

certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,

might impair the privacy rights

of the individuals."

By letter dated 3/12/75, Senator Church stated as

follows, "It is the Committee's understanding that the members

of the Committee and designated staff will have access to any

or all information which the Committee deems necessary for its

inquiry.

We recognize, however, that the Committee inquiry

may touch on sensitive areas, such as the identities of CIA

personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations whose

disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. In the

areas, which matters we have already discussed in our meeting

of February 27, we should discuss jointly, and as you suggested

quickly, what procedures might be followed should the Committee

decide it requires more information in these specific areas."

The 6/30/75 SSC letter requests among other things,

a List oI all police departments and personnel contacted

relative to a particular COINTELPRO operation; a list of all

media persons contacted in relation to this CÓINTELPRO and

the media affiliation.

The 7/1/75 SSC letter requests a list of all persons

outside the FBI (including, but not limited to, employees'

relatives, friendly media personnel, members of clergy,

federal, state and local law enforcement and other officials)

contacted in relation to four persons who were subjects of

RE: SENSTUDY ^ 75

COINTELPRO operations.

This same letter also notes that one

Morris Starsky, one of the four persons referred to above,

was made known

to the FBI during a conference on 6/12/75,

a person who would be the subject of a case study by the SSC.

This is not so. Inquiry was made of those Bureau supervisors

who attended the conference and a review of the memorandum

written

following the conference was made. Neither the

memorandum nor the recollection of Bureau

supervisors attending

the conference indicates the name Morris Starsky was mentioned

by SSC staff personnel.

The 7/8/75 SSC letter requests among other things:

(1) all memoranda and other materials which relate to a meeting

between the President and Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph,

Whitney Young, Mrs. Dorothy Haight, James Farmer and Jack

Greenberg on 11/19/64; (2) a copy of a November, 1964, telegram

from Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., to Director Hoover and all

notes, memoranda, and any other materials reflecting the

disposition of, or actions taken as a result of the receipt

of, said telegram; (3) all memoranda and other materials which

relate to a meeting between the President and Dr. King on

2/9/65; (4) all other materials which relate to the transfer of

former

Special Agent Robert C. Nichols to the Oklahoma Office of

the EBl in June, 1909; (5) all forms and attachments including

forms entitled "Performance Rating Guide For Investigative

Personnel, " from 1959 until retirement for former Special

Agents Robert C. Nichols and Alan Sentinella.

OBSERVATION:

It would appear the above-cited requests do, in tact,

violate the privacy of individuals and possibly place in jeopardy

the identity of persons who cooperated with the FBI. Consistent

with the agreement in the exchange of letters between Colby and

Church dated 3/11 and 12/75, it is believed the Director should

raise these questions with the SSC and attempt to get relief

from the requirement of revealing the names of FBI sources or

violating the privacy of individuals.

Certainly the reguest for

information on former Special Agents

Nichols and Sentinella goes

to the heart of the privacy issue and appears to be a blatant

disregard for their privacy.

SUBJECT: U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

By letter dated July 9, 1975, Senators Frank Church

concern to me and steps which might be taken to expedite

responses to requests for documents essential to the

Committee's inquiry.

It is my intention to raise the question of privacy

as well as the protection of sources at this forthcoming

meeting. In the most recent requests of the Senate Select

Committee dated June 30 and July 8, 1975, copies of which are

in the possession of Mr. O'Connor,

the Committee appears to

disregard the rights of certain individuals' privacy, going

so far as to ask for copies of the annual performance ratings

of certain former Special/Agents of the FBI.

It is my intention to request the Committee to

relieve the FBI from the obligation of violating the

privacy rights.of individuals or placing in jeopardy

the identities of cooperating sources of this Bureau.

It is my intention to raise the question of privacy

as well as the protection of sources at this forthcoming

meeting. In the most recent requests of the Senate Select

Committee dated June 30 and July 3, 1975, copies of which are

in the possession of Mr. O'Connor,

the Committee appears to

disregard the rights of certain individuals' privacy, going

so far as to ask for copies of the annual performance ratings

oi certain former special Agents of the FBI.

It is my intention to request the Committee to

relieve the FBI from the obligation of violating the

privacy rights of individuals or placing in jeopardy

Reference is made to the Attorney General's letter,

July 16, 1975, captioned as above, requesting information

relating to the collection, analysis, use, and dissemination

of organized crime intelligence.

On June 25, 1974, the Director testified before

the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary•

collect intelligence per se" but that it operates under the

Attorney General to appoint officials

"to conduct...investiga-

tions regarding official matters...as may be directed by the

Attorney General." A listing of

any directives issued by

the Department or the Attorney General with respect to organized

crime should be available in the office of the Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice.

With respect to the FBI, all our investigations in

the organized crime field are aimed

prosecution.

at, ono ultimate objective: 15$

During the course of our

hoodlums and the various criminal syndicates operating through-

out the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data

regarding the structure of the organized underworld, the

identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its in-

Iluence, Its primary sources of income, its payotis to corrupt

officials, and the operations of its vast communications networks.

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland

Re:

United States Senate Select Committee

To Study Governmental Operations With

Respect to Intelligence Activities

Most of this information is obtained from paid

informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert

citizens, and from court-approved electronic surveillances

installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus

•Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's

sake. The experience of the FBI over the years has shown that

criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting

illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may

reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these

activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized

underworld

are not aimed at developing general nonspecific

data but at establishing which criminal violations its members

are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court

of law.

Obviously, not every case opened, every lead followed,

or every bit of information received is going to wind up in

Federal court.

On the contrary, much of this material relates

to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the

FBl. When such is the case, we immediately disseminate the

intormatIon to the appropriate federal, state, or local agency.

As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past

five years

alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make

worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, $9,000,000

cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia,

and: $6,000,000 worth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax

against $19,000,000 worth of property arising out of

Federal gambling

cases.

In addition, a considerable portion of the organized

crime intelligence information developed by the FBI is for-

warded to the various Federal Strike Forces coordinating

racket investigations throughout the country and to the

Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this

information in its computerized data

• bank called "Racketéer

Profile."

Pursuant to a request from SA Thomas J. McNiff

SA Daly of this Division contacted Michael Shaheen, Deputy Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination for the Department, on 7-22-75

concerning the current policy regarding excisions which may properly

be made on documents being furnished to the Senate Select Committee

for their review in Bureau space and the policy concerning notes being

taken during the Committee staffers review of such materials.

Shaheen stated that there is no agreement currently in

operation concerning excisions, however, he felt that excisions should

be properly restricted to the protection of sources, sensitive techniques

or methods concerning sensitive ongoing operations. He noted that this

is in general conformity with the proposed agreement concerning this matter

which was being reviewed at the White House. Regarding the question

raised concerning the taking of notes, Shaheen indicated that the proposed

new agreement allowed for the taking of notes on these documents which

notes may be taken to the Senate Select Committee offices. In fact,

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, K. William O'Connor, who

was present during this discussion pointed out it was the intent of the

aforementioned proposed agreement that "screened documents" may be

removed by the Committee staff members to the Senate Select Committee

offices. With this in mind, Shaheen stated we should allow the staff

members to take notes and remove same to their offices.

In response to a Senate Select Committee request for

gui de lines utilized by the Inspection Division, memorandum

H. I. Bassett to W. R. Wannall dated 6/2/75, captioned as above,

noted there would be no objection to a review of the Handbooks

for Headquarters and field office inspections by Committee Staff

members provided the review was conducted in FBI space with an

Inspection Division representative present.

On 7/8/75 Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Select Committee Staff

reviewed the FBIHQ Inspection Manual in the presence of SA

Fred B. Griffith. Mr. Gitenstein was specifically advised these

Manuals are used solely as guidelines for the Inspection Staff and

are not binding on anyone but staff members. They cannot be used

to document any deficiencies noted during an inspection. He was told

such action would have to be based on applicable provisions in either

the Manual of Instructions or the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

During the review it was noted Mr. Gitenstein made notes regarding

the following Sections:

1. Section 2 (Recording the Inspection Findings), pages 5 and 6

which deal with the assembly and distribution of inspection reports and

work papers.

2. Section 4 (Specific Division Operations), pages 4 and 5 which are

concerned with surveys and audits.

3. Section 8 (Inspector's Summaries), pages 1, 2 and 4 which deal

the Director and personnel write-ups.

Mr. Gatenstein staled he would return at a later dave to review in 975

At 11:40 a.m. on July 18, 1975, K. William O'Connor,

Special Counsel in the Deputy Attorney General's Office, telephonically

advised me that his negotiations with the Committee concerning more

restrictive limitations on Committee access to witnesses were not

successful. He said that the Department has determined that the

procedure in effect previously whereby the FBI Director would receive

a request for the availability of FBI personnel for interview and would

determine whether such personnel should be released from applicable

"secrecy agreements would be reinstituted.

I asked Mr. O'Connor whether this meant that the Department

no longer regarded all requests for interview of present or former employees

as "demand" situations requiring the specific authorization of the Department

as if a subpoena had been issued. Mr. O'Connor said that the Department

would not consider such requests in that manner and that the FBI should

make all determinations necessary for the appearance of witnesses for

interview.

Diractor Sac'y -

At 5:14 p.m., on 6/27/75, K. William O'Connor, Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, advised me that he had received

a call from John Elliff of the Senate Select Committee complaining of

what he described as an attempt to interferewith the Committee's investi-

gation by supplying information to the press that the Committee had been

furnished material which it had declined to use or to inquire into because

of its sensitive nature. O'Connor said that Elliff claimed that a journalist

who is friendly with the Committee had advised the Committee that he had

information from a Justice Department official that the Committee had been

furnished information originating in the FBI that Communist funds were

used to finance Martin Luther King; that King had been related to the CP, USA,

and that the Senate Select Committee had treated this matter as a "hot potato"

and that the information also indicäted that "King laughed all the way to the

bank."

O'Connor said that Elliff protested the apparent disclosures

by the Justice Department to the press and claimed that it appeared an

effort was being made to interferewith the Committee's work. O'Connor

told Elliff he had no knowledge of anyone in the Justice Department furnishing

any such information to the press and further, he told him that he did not

believe that information concerning CP funding of King had been furnished

to the Committee.

O'Connor said that he did not believe that the FEr had furnished

such information to the news media but he wanted us to be aware of Elliff's

complaint. O'Connor said that it is possible that during interviews conducted

by staff of the Committee, they have received statements indicating that

Communist funds were used by King, but he does not believe that any docu-

mentation of that has been furnished to the Committee as yet.

INTD has received no report. or has any information

concerning the alleged leak referred to in this memorandum.

Concerning t. the allegation in this memorandum

that information originated with the FBI that communist

Iunds were used to Iinance Martin Luther King, JI.,

and that

King had been "related" to the CPUSA, the following is noted.

We have never had any information that communist tunds,

literally, were used to finance King. We did have reliable

reports that King was helped in a financial way, particularly

as to advice regarding fund raising, by a close advisor,

Stanley David Levison, who was a secret member of the CPUSA.

However, none of our reports are known to have claimed that

"communist funds" were financing King. King was never known

to have been a member of the CPUSA. It is true that he had

a number of close associates such as Levison who at the time

were either current or past CPUSA members.

INID is unable to pinpoint the report that "King

laughed all the way to the bank."
