Dear Mr. Hoover: .

Wednesday and wish to thank you for so generously
giving me your time.

I have not contacted any of the departments and
agencies whose cooperation we hope to enlist in
connection with the government-wide intelligence
unit other Unai your Bureau and the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. I think it would be helpful to have
your designee or designees named before making any
further contacts in order to have available your
advice with respect to which departments and agencies
should be included as well as those you deem unneces-
sary to include at this time. : \

I sincerély enjoyed my conversation with you on

In view of the fact that preliminarily, at least,
all we wish to do is discuss the subject very generally
jfor the purpose of assessing realistically the nature
jand structure of the intelligence unit which we hope
[te achieve, I am of the present opinion that the size
of the initial group should be somewhat limited. I
would.be-grateful .for -your thoughts, on this aspect of. ..

The Director has instructed that Assistant Attorney -~;
General Robert C. Mardian be advised that Inspector George C.
Moore will represent the Director in connection with meetings
which will take place with respect to a Government-wide
intelligence unit being formed by Mr. Mardian. A letter in
this regard is attached.

It is noted that in incoming letter from Mr. Mardian
dated November 27, 1970, Director.was requested to furnish
the identity of hie representative to the captioned mit and
was also requested to furnish his advice concerning other
departments and agencies which-should-be included in such
meetings. In this regard Mr. Mardian pointed out that he is of
the present opinion that the size should be somewhat limited.
In our reply to Mr. Mardian we are pointing out that we are also
in agreement that the size should be limited but will abide by
his decision regarding other agencies invited to participate.
It is not felt that we should be placed in a position of being

- responsible for the make-up of any such group which might be formed.

Mr. Mardian also asked for the Director's thoughts
as to substantive matters to be resolved at such meetings. It
appears that it is certainly premature at this point to make

Wot - It was indicated that they had been given the
‘assignment to expeditiously form a committee to have
access to all intelligence in the Government concerning
political terrorists in the United States in order to
render evaluations to Messrs. Mitchell, Ehrlichman, and
Haldeman who in-turn would advise the President. These
evaluations would be for the purpose of determining, but
necessarily limited to, such things as the severity of
the problem under study regarding various terroristic
groups and to make recommendations as to various options
which the President might take as to Federal response
concerning such problems. The responses which were

j mentioned as examples were legislation, prosecution,
and other measures designed to alert and prevent acts

| of terrorism.

. It was apparent that both Dean and Mardian
had not given any real thought to mechanics of the
operation of this proposed committee as evidenced by
the fact that during the meeting Mardian called the
Attorney General direct in order to ascertain who would
pay Judge Sharp's salary and what office space he would
temporarily occupy. During the discussion with Attorney
General Mitchell, Mardian was told by the Attorney General

that Sharp would be funded by the Justice Department and
that the committee which was being formed was to be

of possible publicity concerning this it was decided
by Attorney General Mitchell not to have White House
in the title and that it should operate under some
insignificant name as “Intelligence Evaluation
Committee and in the event the press picked up any~
thing about its operation the response from Justice
would be that Justice Sharp was working with the
Department's Inter-Division Information Unit.

Mr. Mardian further informed that he had

purposely kept the initial meeting of the committee

small but felt that it should be enlarged to include
other Government agencies which could maxe a con~
tribution and would have a definite interest in such
intelligence evaluations, In this regard, he stated
that the Attorney General was calling Secretary of
Defense Laird, Secretary of the Treasury Kennedy, and Vice
Admiral Noel A. M. Gayler of the National Security Agency
in order for them to have representatives at the next
‘meeting. Mardian stressed that the President wanted
. this committee set up as soon as possible in order

to become functional and for that reason he intended ©

to call a meeting early next week, at which time other
matters such as staffing and procedural plans would be
formulated.

“Zé was observed that Mr. "Matdian as‘wéll ‘ages

expected that requirements will be levied against us
in the future as well as other Government agencles
depending upon the nature of the problem which will
be under study.

No mention was made either as to the staffing
of this committee but both Mardian and Dean indicated
that they contemplated a small nucleus of personnel
working directly with Justice Sharp from the member
agencies at least on a semipexrmanent basis. In this
connection, the Justice Department has assigned . Doherty
on a fulltime basis to assist Justice Sha:p.

following the initial meeting of the Committee on 12/3/70 he
reported back to Attorney General Mitchell at which time

Mr, Mitchell impressed upon Mardian the keen personal interest
of the President on a top priority basis in having the cap-
tioned Committee established and functioning in very short

order to an extent whereby. the President can be assured of
getting the very best.intelligence available from all. sources
within the Government in order to be in the best possible
position to decide action to be initiated and responses to
bemade based upon such intelligence. Mardian stated that
‘either he (Mardian) or Attorney General Mitchell had spoken
personally with heads of the agencies represented on captioned
Committee and had been assured their full cooperation.

Me. Egil Keogh LDevuglit up the security factor invelved
and cautioned everyone present that the White House wanted to make
certain that everything is done to prevent any leakage to the
press that this particular Committee is in existence. It was
reiterated that if any such inquiry is made by the press, Justice
Sharp or Mr. Mardian would handle such by stating the Committee
was operating under the Justice Department in connection with the
operations of the Inter-Divisional Information Unit (IDIU).
Mardian stated in fact this Committee has nothing whatever to
‘-do with the IDIU-but this response is for security cover purposes ©

upon the intelligence agencies comprising the Committee to
give him appropriate briefings and the orientation necessary
to carry out his job. In this regard, he stated he desired

to know more about the intelligence operations of each agency
and would spend the next several weeks preparing himself in
this connection. He said he fully expects to return to the
State of Washington Supremé,,Sench sometime during the coming
year but wanted to do a good, effective job for Mr. Ehrlichman
ore returning and felt perhaps Mr. Ehrlichman selected him to
\fchair this Committee because he had no intelligence background.

4 brief discussion was had concerning material sub-
mitted by all agencies regarding (1) a list of political
terrorist groups in the United States (2) a list of proposed

4 ‘a miertes to be utilized in evaluating intelligence
coverage of the groups and (5) a calendar of proposed extrenist
events for the next six months, Mr, Doherty of Justice Sharp's
staff was instructed to prepare an engrossment of all agency
contributions so that the Committee at its next meeting could
establish priorities and undertake necessary intelligence
evaluations needed by the White House.

.Mr. Dean of the White House commented specifically
, concerning the calendar of extremist events (which was almost
| totally composed of FBI submissions) and the Committee
recommended that any additions or deletions to this calendar
be brought to the Committee's attention on a continuing
basis. (Unless advised to the contrary, this will be done)

y AS a matter of intévest, Mr. Mardian was calléd trom
the meeting several times for calls from the Attorney General
and he mentioned after one call that the activities of the
Jewish Defense League were causing a great deal of concern

and the State Department was pressuring the Justice Department
to secure an injunction against the Defense League in order to
curtail their activities against Soviets and their establishments
in this country. Mardian commented that he had very little
confidence in the State Department and sometimes when he talks

to a desk officer at the State Department, he feels that he is
talking "to the enemy."

This afternoon Judge Morell Sharp, Chairman of
captioned Committee on which I serve as the Director's
vepresentative, called and stated that he would like to
advise me of a rather small problem which he realizes is
not within the FBI's jurisdiction but wanted to make it a
matter of record in our files.

The Judge stated that his Committee has just moved
into space in Federal Office Building #7 on Jackson Place and
this afternoon, around 1 PMs, a stranger very aggressively

fame to the door and forced lie Way in imsSiviing pum udilily

the telephone. He indicated his name was Dr. Sandler (phonetic)
who is interested in nuclear studies and he proceeded to make
about four telephone calls looking for a Colonel John Sheffie
(phonetic) who was preparing some sort of study in which aie
was very much interested.

Judge Sharp's secretary, Mrs. Dohaney, was the only
. person in the room when this stranger came in and she stated
that she was very much concerned about the security aspects
of the Committee in view of the fact that this individual
seemed very inquisitive and nosey in trying to find out the
identity of the group currently occupying the space in that
particular room. It is noted that this space was previously
occupied by an executive study group which went by the name
_ of Atlantic-Pacific Interocean. Study Group vhich is no longer

Judge Sharp stated that he realizes that there is
nothing the FBI can do about this and, in fact, the stranger
was probably just seeking the free use of a Government tele-
phone by forcing his way into the office space. Nevertheless,
the Judge is very security conscious and did not want something
like this to pass without the Bureau's knowing about.it,

taken in our letter dated 1/27/71 in which we stated that
we could not provide assistance in staffing a working group
because of manpower and budgetary problems,

too early to predict the size of the demonstrations scheduled
for Washington, D. C., the first week in May. As previously
reported, these demonstrations are being sponsored by the
Peonles Coalition for Peace and Justice. Some officials
Of the Coalition, partiouwlariy Rennie vavis, have bec
calling for a shutdown of Washington, D, C., on one day of
the demonstrations, probably May 5. The Committee's conclusions

Observations
7 We concur with this conclusion. It should be noted
~~~ fenat antiwar demonstrations have increased measurably since

the military action began in Laos, For example, on 2/10
‘demonstrations were held in over 60 cities throughout the
fUnited States, It should be noted that in its background
information on this conclusion, the Committee mentions the
"National Student Movement" in connection with the recent
Student Mobilization Committee antiwar conference at Catholic
University. The way this is written leaves the impression
that there is an organized group called the National Student
Movement which is, of course, inaccurate. -

This eStinate, canticoned as ahove, 2:
a high government official must be considered a defin ite proba~

Observations
We concur with this conclusion, It should be noted
\tnat the background material submitted by the Committee

supporting this conclusion states that violence«prone groups
such as the Black Panther Party and the Weatherman have endorsed
political kidnaping. We do not have information that the
Weatherman has endorsed kidnapings although it has called for
assassinations for political purposes,

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise of a
request made this morning by Mr. John Doherty, Executive
Director of the staff of captioned Committee, for current
information concerning antiwar demonstrations planned during
| the latter part of April and the first part of May, 1971.

Mr. Doherty advised that the activities of antiwar

captioned Committee is calling upon all agencies comprising
the Committee to submit up-dated material concerning this
matter by Thursday, 2/25/71.

Mr. Doherty further advised that the material pre-
pared in connection with this request should analyze what 1
effect the proposed April 24, 1971, demonstration in Washington,
D. C., would have upon subsequently planned demonstrations.
He also requested that the material be prepared in accordance
with the format utilized by the Committee in the preparation
of its intelligence estimates setting forth (1) the problem,

This memorandum is to advise of the results of the
3-3-71 meeting of the captioned Committee which took place
in the staff conference room of the Committee located on the
4th floor of the 9th and D Streets Building.

This meeting was attended by representatives of the
Internal Security Division of the Department, Defense
‘Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Central
Intelligence Agency, Secret Service and FBI. The meeting was
chaired by Assistant Attorney General Robert C. Mardian of the
Internal Security Division of the Department.

The major part of the meeting consisted of a review
of the intelligence estimates that had been prepared by the
Committee staff concerning: (1) May, 1971, Demonstrations,

*.(2) Likelihood of New Momentum on the Antiwar Activities and
Forces in View of the Laos and Cambodian Situation, and (3)

The Committee staff is preparing guidelines which will be
‘issued to each of the agencies making up the Committee in
order to have individual draft estimates prepared. (Upon
~.__| receipt, the request will be analyzed and submitted for
= rapproval prior to our undertaking preparation of estimate).

Mr, Mardian expressed his concern over the fact that
the staff of the Committee is not large enough to prepare the
intelligence estimates needed to carry out the mission of the
Committee. In this regard he stated he is in receipt of a
letter from the Department of Defense indicating that since the
FBI is not furnishing personnel to the Committee's working
group, Department of Defense also will be unable to furnish
jpersonnel in the future. Mr. Mardian stated that this leaves
the working staff composed merely of representatives from
the Intarnal Security Division of the Department, Secret
Service, National Security Agency and the Centrai Intelligence
, Agency. He expressed the hope that something could be done
} in the near future to fully staff this group in view of the
obvious increased activity on the part of militant groups and
individuals in the country.

SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

By letter dated 3/10/71, attached, the Intelliger
batts Committee (IEC) furnished two estimates drawn up

y the Committee, The first concerns the demonstrations
cheduled to be held at Washington, D.C., 4/24/71 to 5/5/71.
fhe second is a Calendar of Events (demonstrations) going
through 5/5/71.

Bureau comments or approval of the estimates is
“requested by 3/12/71. Telephonic approval was requested.

The estimate concerning the pel
Shangton concluces that it is
size of these demonstrations. (This is an accurate conclusion
as planning for these demonstrations is still taking place.)
It also concludes that the demonstration on 4/24/71 will
probably reduce participation in subsequent demonstrations
Jas participants will not remain in Washington until 5/5/71.
(This is also a valid conclusion. April 24 has been set for
the date of the massive demonstration by both the National
Peace Action Coalition and the People's Coalition for Peace
and Justice, the sponsors of it.) It is also concluded that
these demonstrations will be similar to past major demon-
strations, It points out that during the past demonstrations,
a small number of participants have engaged in vandalism and
other destructive acts. It also points out that the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice has indicated that nonviolent
civil disobedience will take place. (As of the date of the

I have read the entire estimate and find it a concise and

in connection with the forthcoming April and May demonstrations. The
information appears to be correct insofar as can be judged by that which *
has previously come to my attention. It is true, as the Domestic

produced and disseminated to the Committee emanates from the
FBI,

However, if we are to play a part in the functioning
of the Committee as requested by the Attorney General in his Z

details concerning methods and.standards of.the.operation of t
the Committee staff itself so we cen make er decision :

appropriate in this regard for Inspector George C. Moore,
the Director's representative on this Committee, to make a

been coordinating the intelligence gathering functions with
respect to extremist groups, It is noted that staff members
from other agencies represented on the Committee are in grades

stature should represent the Bureau, It is noted that Cotter
suffered a heart attack in September, 1970, and is currently
(on limited duty, However, he has made a good recovery from
this coronary, is now working on a full-time basis, and there
is no reason why he cannot handle this Committee.

Also, if the Director so desires, Cotter will be ina
position to assume the increasing administrative ‘liaison functions
between the Committee staff and the Bureau, which would relieve
Inspector George C, Moore of these duties currently peing
handled by him, Inspector More, of course, would still be the
Director's representative on the IEC itself (distinguished from :

To recommend that the attached letter and enclosures

As you have been previously advised by memorandum of
R. D. Cotter to C. D. Brennan, 6/24/71, same title, Mr. Doherty
requested information we have on the subject of "The
Interrelationship of Arab Terrorist Groups and U.S. Black
Militants,'' The IEC with the concurrence of the White House is
q scheduling an intelligence estimate on that subject.

American black extremists have established a close
. velatiouship with Arab terrorist groups; much anti-Semitic and
anti-Zionist propaganda has appeared in the black extremist press
and complete support of the Palestinian "liberation struggle" has
been expressed by black extremists in this country.

Two groups containing black extremists and/or subversives
have traveled to the Middle East in the past year. The groups
‘ostensibly were to observe the situation and return to the U.S.
to propagandize on behalf of the Arabs but both reportedly visited
Arab guerrilla camps and one group was trained in the use of
handguns, rifles, and explosives. One member of this latter group
claimed members of that group were expected to commit acts of
terrorism when they returned to this country. Others of the
group have denied receiving such instruction but members of this
‘group have engaged in firearms training upoh their return to this
count: Both groups have engaged in propaganda’ efforts on behalf

No information has been received to date to indicate
that any members of the two. groups who.visited the Middle Fast . |.
have engaged in terrorist activities in the U.S. ‘

_Re:_ Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

Mardian reviewed briefly the various ongoing studies
which are already underway by other agencies relating to this H
general matter. These include a study being made by Assistant H
Attorney General Rehnquist regarding classification and de- H
classification procedures (pursuant to National Security Council :
Directive 117 of January, 1971); a Department of Defense damage ‘
estimate dealing with the Ellsberg and related disclosures; a i
Defense Department study on security management and clearances
at the Rand Corporation; and a Defense Department review of
the origin and development of the entire "McNamara Study" on
which the so-called Pentagon Papers were based. Mardian said
that the result of all these studies would be funneled to the
| IEC on a continuing basis and that the Committee would liave
access to any other information it might need from any component
of the Executive Branch.

Mardian also pointed out that several Congressional
investigations will be conducted concerning the Pentagon Papers
and related developments. He said that one in particular, by
the House Armel Services Committee, will be a penetrative study
and will have the full cooperation of the Executive Branch.

‘He asked that this information be closely held. Mardian said
that an exact definition of the objectives of the IEC in
connection with this study should be worked out by the Committee
Staff in the near future in line with the capabilities of the
Committee, He again stressed that anything he Committee needs
from any agency will be: made availabl: e, if.

receipt of input from current reviews being made by Defense
Department and Justice. Mardian said that he was well aware
this job-is a complex and difficult one but stressed that he
felt that it could be of great value to the White House and
the Executive Branch generally and that this study alone

Memorandum R. D. Cotter to Mr. C. D.
Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

It was agreed that special attention should be

|devoted to the possibilities of unauthorized disclosure
‘of classified information being made through the dissem-
‘ination and handling of such data by non-Government
agencies especially private contractors or subcontractors

—~~._.who are granted access to sensitive data in connection
with Government projects. The IEC will focus particularly
on such contractors who deal in study projects and policy
matters such as the Rand Corporation and similar "think

7 tanks." As a matter of fact the starting point for the
IEC will be an examination of the Government's relation-
ship to Rand and a review of policies and practices of
Rand in handling classified information and granting
access to it. (In this connection IEC will obtain copies

: of ongoing studies currently being conducted by Defense

x Department.) From there the IEC study will branch out
to cover similar private organizations with access to
classifiea information, witn tne objective ot recommend=
ing specific measures to tighten security gaps and fore-
stall a recurrence of the Ellsberg fiasco.

Since his assignment to the IEC staff, Cotter
has devoted a great majority of his time to this assign-
ment. As. reported in previous memoranda, the IEC has
been requested by the White House to consider various
aspects of security leaks typified by the Ellsberg case.
The IEC will play a major role in drawing together and
correlating the various studies which have been under-
taken by different agencies as an outgrowth of the

should be undertaken by the agency involved, It has always
been the Bureau's position that the ultimate answer to
leaks lies in tight administrative control and internal
discipline within the various agencies,

The report also calls for improved security
training and orientation programs both within the Government
and private industries handling classified material and
for tougher security inspections. This report specifically
deplores the practices of some Government officials retaining
classified documents as "private papers" and urges that an
executive directive be issued prohibiting this practice,

From the above, it can be seen that in large

measure this report reflects views long held by the

Director and recommends practices which already are fol-
lowed by the FBI. It is believed this report is. an excellent
. statement of the problem of unauthorized disclosures and
that it contains a number of hard-hitting and effective
. recommendations to improve the situation, The IEC staff

is to take up this report at a meeting on 10/26/71, At

Mr. John W. Dean III, Counsel to the President, ' :

has requested that IEC conduct an in-depth study of the ! H

plans and strategies of the “militant left vis a vis the ! |

labor movement."' _This request was prompted by a news- i fl

letter emphasizing the need for worker-student alliances

which was prepared by the Revolutionary Marxist Caucus,

an adjunct of the Spartacist League. To a great extent,

of course, this study will depend upon information fur-~
nished by the Bureau,

In line with the above, Bureau will furnish
background data regarding attempts of the militant left,
both black and white, to exert influence and draw strength
from the American Labor Movement. This data, available
in Bureau files, will include a brief history of the
communist movement, both Chinese and Soviet oriented, as
related to the role of labor in the movement with special

“ emphasis placed upon plans and strategies of New Left and
black extremist groups.

A brief summary will be included regarding the
various splinter groups and their plans to infiltrate and :
use the labor movement in furthering their various causes. :
The study will be mainly concerned with current activities. 5 :

threat to domestic order posed by outbreaks at Attica State
Prison.

Attached report emphasizes possibility of major
disorders in penal institutions; however, official opinion
is that chances of major uprisings are slight and have not
been significantly increased by the Attica incident. Only
in a few isolated cases is there information regarding
concerted effort by extremist groups to organize prisoners
or foment disorder, Major prisons in California, Indiana,-
Massachusetts, and New York are considered to have highest
potential for future disorders.

Data necessary for this study was requested of

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

By memorandum, R. D. Cotter to Mr. E. S. Miller, dated 1/5/Tl, the
Laboratory was requested to submit observations on any national security hazards
posed by)\'phone | phreak: eaking,"’ the use of telephone lines by private individuals who
are familiar with various signalling systems employed by the telephone company.
Reference memorandum was precipitated by an article in the October, 197i, issue
of Esquire magazine by Ron Rosenbaum, captioned "Secrets of the Little Blue Box."

The term/\blue box" is applied to a tone signalling device which
generates tones norma. ly used by fll operators and telephone switching equipment to
jnitiate and dial long distance calls within the telephone direct distance dialing network
(DD). The Laborato ry has been familiar with “blue boxes"! for many years A

im tiv Ly ib
"P) hone phreaks" are individuals who are either technically competent to build a
"blue box" or have obtained one from some source and who amuse themselves by
using the "blue box" to make toll-free calls within the DDD network, Some "blue
boxes" are known to have been used by gamblers to make toll-free calls that
normally produce no record of the call to telephone company billing equipment. In

a recent Title I court-authorized wiretap in Las Vegas, interceptions were made of
a "blue box" so used. :
| ’ "The Laboratory is of the opinion that "blue boxes" do not pos aiy
substantial national security threat to telephone communications, A "blue box" could
be used to initiate a single long distance call thereby tying up a single calling path,
but it is not felt likely that a sufficient number of "blue boxes" could be operated
independently to tie up enough single channels to materially effect the toll network.

&



‘Memorandum to Mr. Conrad

RE: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)
INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS ©
f :

i
The Bell System and most independent telephone companies do not provide
dial accessible busy verification codes to allow dialing into a call in progress, which
could be a simple method of wiretapping.

i

Various defense telephone networks which are accessible by DDD have
an operator intercept such calls and handle dialing within the network.

While the Laboratory does not have information on many computer
systems accessible by telephone dialing, such systems as NCIC, which is the center
of a dedicated network, appear to have adequate safe guards to prevent unauthorized
use or manipulation of data stored in; the computer.

While it is felt that the "blue box" and "phone phreaking" do not at this
tlimé pose any national security ihreai based on availabie information, it wouid pelicove
the major telephone companies to continually review their vast switching systems as to
susceptibility to unauthorized access to insure that new features do not inadvertently
open a door which could effect essential telephone communications.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. For information

experience indicates large~scale demonstrations can rapidly
develop into violence despite announced peaceful intentions.
San Diego has been relatively free of demonstrations in the
past, but the Republican Convention will serve as a magnet,
drawing large numbers of youth to the city for the Convention
including ‘street people’ and others experienced in militant
disruptions.

All Bureau information incorporated in the attached
report has been previously disseminated in letterhead memorandum

RECOMMENDATIONS:

2) That appropriate sections of Domestic Intelligence

with pertinent information regarding possible disruptions at
both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in a
form suitable for dissemination (reports, letterhead memoranda

the Community Congress of San Diego has announced estab-
lishment of a group to provide for medical, legal, housing

the vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the American

to observe that the Miami anti-Castro Cubans present a pos-

local groups, Florida Peoples Platform Coalition (FPPC) and
the Miami Snowplow Company, continue to plan for services and

activities on the Republican National Convention later in
August.

as well as local officials, have expressed concern regarding
opposition to protest demonstrations by various Cuban exile
groups in the Miami area. An antiprotest movement, known as

have been made, and training programs are underway in prepa~

R. D. Cotter
STAFF SUPPORT -- INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE |

During May, 1971, former Attorney General Mitchell requested
that Bureau assign two qualified Agents and one secretary to permanent
working staff of Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC). This
Committee is composed of representatives of Justice, Bureau, Central
Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Secret Service, Defense is

: Department and Treasury Department and it prepares reports and
; estimates, primarily regarding possible civil disorders for the
| White House and the Attorney General.

™ rasnonse to Attorney General Mitchell's request, two Agents

: were assigned full time to IEC in May, 1971 (Section Chief R. D. Cotter

and Supervisor G. T. Tunstall). Cotter has recently been appointed to

: the newly created post of Bureau's Document Classification Officer to
carry out implementation of the new classification and declassification
procedures. It is believed SA Tunstall can at this time handle the Bureau's
representation to IEC alone; however, we should advise the Attorney
General of our recall of one representative from IEC.

ACTION:

Attached for approval is appropriate letter to Attorney General
in this connection.

: The report concludes that the number of protesters
will fall far short of the number predicted earlier by

“protest leaders. Massive civil disobedience and disruptions

are not expected at the Democratic National Convention.

Some potential for violence does exist in view of the presence

of violence-prone protesters and local antagonism against the

protesters by both senior citizens and Cuban exile groups.

YECTC-INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC
INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

IEC, formed in late 1970 at the specific instructions
of President Nixon, is composed of representatives of the
various U. S. intelligence agencies. The Committee, although
housed in the Department of Justice space under the direction
of an executive director who is a special assistant to the
Attorney General, is directly responsible to The White House.
Its purpose is to review and evaluate all data collected by
the U. S. intelligence community and to submit results of such
evaluations to The White House. Participating agencies,
including the Bureau, are represented on the working staff.

On March 21, 1972, the President's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board (FIAB), in furtherance of the President's
announced reorganization of U. S. intelligence efforts requested
IEC to obtain from the various agencies and furnish to FIAB an
overall list of the intelligence requirements cf the U. S.
intelligence community which could be collected domestically.
FIAB requested such list in connection with their study of
ways and means to improve the quality of intelligence within
the limitations of recent budgetary and other resource con-
straints imposed upon the overall,U. S. intelliaence effort. 4.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

This report, which will be disseminated only to The
White House with copies to the IEC member agencies, contains
observations which coincide with the already formulated
attitude of the FIAB which is interested in and nurturing
broader across-the-board intelligence collection efforts. The
thrust being put forth is human collection versus mechanical
collection, In other words it is being realized that the
U. S. has been putting too many eggs in one basket at the
expense of what is thought to be by many in the intelligence
community a better and more economical means of intelligence

"collection. The President in his plans for reorganization of

intelligence efforts does not desire a cut in intelligence
gathering but rather the replacement of costly collection
methods with more economical and thorough means.

If this theory is sustained and the President
endorses it, the FBI will be the logical agency to handle the

‘Sob because-of onr present responsibility of intelligence

collecting within the United States. If this ocqurs anda
since our duties would be substantially broadened, additional

manpower and resources will be needed.

Organizations involved include the Students for a Democratic!

~ SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

"New York Times’ today carries lead story captioned
{White Hi House Ring Reportedly Spied on Radicals in.'70."
THis article, written by Seymour Hersh, deals chiefly with
history and activities of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee
(IEC), an interagency group which was formed at the direction
of the White House in late 1970 and which has been furnishing
general intelligence reports to the White House since that date.
The Committee is made up of representatives of the FBI, Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Department
of Defense, Secret Service, Treasury Department and Justice Department.

c While the "Times" article contains elements of fact, it presents
a badly distorted version of the objectives and operations of the IEC.
This memorandum summarizes the "Times" allegations and sets
out the actual facts for the information of the Acting Director.

"New York Times" Charges f
According to Hersh article, unidentified sources have: reported

that the IEC was ‘established by the White House in 1970 to collect
and evaluate information about radical and antiwar groups. The
article claims that the IEC is operated "clandestinely" out of the
Justice Department and has reported directly to John Dean, former
White House Counsel, and John Caulfield, the former White House

Memorandum to Mr. Felt
Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

intelligence operation was needed during the national political
conventions last summer. Supposedly, government investigators
are now seeking to determine whether some of IEC's classified
reports may have been used by Justice Department agencies and
the White House to justify "undercover and double-agent activities"
against groups opposed to the Nixon Administration, including the
Democrats. ; :
The 'Times" article referred to testimony by James McCord

’ to the effect that officials of the Internal Security Division of Justice
Department had supplied the Committee for the Reelection of
the President with intelligence reports on radical activities for
possible political use. McCord claimed to have visited the "analysis
and evaluation section" of Internal Security Division to receive
some material. In reply to 2 question, McCord expressed the |
belief that he had obtained this information from the Intelligence
Evaluation Committee.

The "Times'has identified Bernard Wells, a former FBI Agent,

as head of IEC and claims that I&C members include officials of

_ FBI, CIA, NSA and "various other police and official units. ' IEC
was reportedly set up to meet the grave threat posed by radical and
antiwar groups. The article notes that in response to this threat
the FBI and Justice Department had developed an'elaborate system
of undercover agents," although it did not specifically charge that
TEC had engaged in this activity.

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Presidential Assistant Ehrlichman and that it would operate
from the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House.
~--...__ He said the Committee would be headed by Morell Sharp, former
“judge from the State of Washington, and he expressed the hope
that all member agencies, including the FBI, would appoint top
men to represent them in the group. Mr. Hoover assured
Mardian of the FBI's co-operation in this endeavor. On 12/1/70, :
Section Chief G. C. Moore of the Domestic Intelligence Division, q
was named as the FBI's representative. In December, 1970, and j
during the early months of 1971, several meetings of the group
were held in the office of John Dean. They were attended by
representatives of Justice, CIA, FBI, NSA, Secret Service,
Defense Department, Treasury Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Krogh,
Mx. Mardian and Judge Sharp. At the initial meeting, the group
/ adopted the name intelligence Evaluation Commitice and Mardian
explained that the group had been assigned the mission of pooling
information regarding political terrorism in the U.S. According
to Mardian, the Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H. R.
Haldeman at the White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell
_ and they, in turn, would advise the President so that he could weigh
what federal action was necessary. During one meeting Krogh
cautioned those present that the White House wanted to make
certain there were no leaks tothe press regarding the IEC.

As a matter of fact, during late January, 1971, it was announced
that Judge Sharp was dropping out as head of IEC in view of the fact
that his presence in the Executive Office Building had caused several
inquiries by.newspaper.men, At the same time it was decided to

for the permanent working staff of IEC. Mr. Hoover acceded

to this request and two Domestic Intelligence Division Supervisors

(R. D. Cotter and G. T. Tunstall) were designated along with

a secretary. FBI staff support for the IEC has continued to the
present time except beginning in July, 1972, only one Agent Supervisor
has been assigned to the Committee.

Other agencies have also supplied staff support for IEC. For
example, for the first year and a half Department of Defense
furnished a professional analyst and during the summer of 1971,

NSA provided a security specialist on a full-time basis. All member
agencies have designated representatives who attend the regular
weekly staff meetings of IEC and who furnish assistance on a part-time
basis.

Organization and Activities of IEC

IEC is headed by an Executive Director, former FBI Agent Wells, and
a Deputy, another former FBI Agent (James McGrath), The IEC has two
full-time secretaries including one from the FBI. During roughly the
first six months of IEC's existence, its efforts were devoted primarily
to preparing periodic intelligence estimates with reference to antiwar
‘ activities, especially the May, 1971, activities at Washington, D.C.
Thereafter, the IEC has given its attention to and prepared reports
. concerning a variety of domestic intelligence matters of likely interest
to the President, most of them revolving around possible civil disorders.

| potential of racial violence, another dealing with prison riots and

Memorandum to Mr. Felt
| Re; INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

To our knowledge, James McCord has never had any
connection with the IEC. It appears that McCord's reference
to the "analysis and evaiuation section'' may have denoted a
unit which did exist in the Internal Security Division of the
Department, namely the Analysis and Evaluation Unit, which was
under Mardian's direction.

At no time has the IEC engaged in any activities of an
operational nature or made any recommendations for operational
activities. It has concerned itself entirely with preparing summary-

wv type estimates based on the information contributed by member
agencies. While its reports have been classified, they have generally
speaking not involved particularly sensitive information and they
have all rolated to subversive or criminal activities of one type
or another of likely interest to the White House. It is hard to visualize

* how any political use could have been made of any IEC's reports.

In any. case, FBI representatives on the IEC have no knowledge
whatever of any political ramifications in the activities of this group.

One particular project undertaken by the IEC should be mentioned.
* During duly, 1971, Assistant Attorney General Mardian called a
meeting of the IEC and explained that he had just returned from
seeing the President in San Clemente, and that as a result of his
visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the IEC with the preparation
of a comprehensive report regarding the handling of classified and
sensitive information. Mardian noted this study had been prompted
by the Elisberg case but said that the IEC would in no way concern itself
with the Elisherg matter from an investigative or prosecutive stand-
Mardian’said the’ ‘President wanted the TEC to conduct’an

for Mr. Nixon's consideration.

“Showtly thereafter, during thé last week of July, 1971, IEC's
Executive Director Doherty reported to the IEC staff that a White
cits atatfmember:had‘been-appointed:to: work-with:IEC-in.cenducting«
s inquiries with regard to the handling of classified information.
‘The latter was identified as Gordon Liddy, who has recently received
considerable notoriety in connection with the Ellsberg case.

| NW 55023 DocId:32989608 Page 251 — 5 bd


Memorandum to Mr. Felt -
Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Liddy did meet on one occasion with the IEC staff in
August, 1971, at which time he discussed the project in very
general terms. This was the only contact Liddy had with the
IEC, either personally or in writing, to the lnowledge of the
FBI representatives. The IEC published a special report in
November, 1971, entitled "The Unauthorized Disclosure of
Classified Information" which completed this particular
assignment. This study alluded to the Ellsberg situation, but
only as a case in point. It dealt primarily with existing federal
procedures for the handling of classified data and set out nine
specified recommendations to tighten these procedures.

ACTION:

This is for the information of Mr. Ruckelshaus.

intercept mail, tap telephones, review income tax returns and plant

the national-security plan that Hoover objected to. That was the
blue print. "

JECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

eee ce : i

The Seattle Office has submitted an airtel
enclosing a letterhead memorandum, both dated 5/30/73 and ~~
attached, setting forth some "concerns" from U, S. District Judge
Morrell E. Sharp, Western District of Washington, Seattle, as
expressed with regard to the captioned Committee, which is now
receiving a substantial amount’ of publicity in the press.

Judge Sharp is a former Supreme Court Justice of the
' State of Washington who originally was to have headed the IEC as
its operating chairman and did, in fact, attend several of the 5
early meetings, JI attended the meetings of this Committee as the :
Bureau's representative,

: ‘

In the incoming letterhead memorandum Judge Sharp,- among
other things, related that "while the initial purposes of the group
appear to be quite legitimate there was some discussion about some
clandestine operations that may be engaged in and at this point it
became evident to him that he did not want to have any part of it
and furthermore he did not want to operate in Washington without

-his real purpose being known to his contacts in the State of
Washington, namely Senator Jackson and Senator Magnuson,"

Although Judge Sharp might have been aware of some
“clandestine'! operations- discussed. in his presence by Mr. Robert.

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

would be as well as the overall purpose of the Committee. (I might
add that very few present seemed to have any conception either as
‘to what form the Committee should take, including Mardian, who
evidently had been given the assignment to establish a committee

~~~ Which would coordinate intelligence and furnish evaluations to the
President.) 7

A considerable amount of concern was voiced by both
Mardian and John W. Dean III (who represented The White House) at
these early meetings as to the necessity for keeping the functions
of this unit away from the press and prevent The White House from
being identified with the group. Judge Sharp was cautioned during
each meeting very carefully in this regard as to how to handle
this matter in the event of a press inquiry.

In this regard there is attached one copy each of
memoranda dated 12/3/70 and 14/16/70 which set out details relative
to White House concern as to the necessity for providing a
security cover for the IEC. You will note that Page 2 of the
12/3/70 memorandum shows that Mardian was instructed by the
Attorney General to have Judge Sharp's salary paid by the Justice
Department and the Committee would be considered to be operating
under the Justice Department's auspices and arrangements were being
made for space in Federal Office Building Number Seven near The
White House. It was also indicated that original thinking was to

. have the Committee go by the name of "The White House Intelligence
Evaluation Committee" but because of possible publicity it was
decided by the Attorney General not to have The White House in the
title but have the Committee operate under some insignificant name

, Such.as.the Intelligence Evaluation Committee.'!| The purpose of _

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

the Committee was operating under the Justice Department in
connection with the operation of the Interdivision Information
Unit (IDIU). Mr. Mardian stated, in fact, that the IEC had nothing
whatever to do with the IDIU but the response would be for security
cover purposes only.

Our files show Judge Sharp attended three meetings of
the IEC all during the initial stages of its development -- first
on 12/3/70 followed by meetings on 12/16/70 and 1/11/71. He did
not attend the fourth scheduled meeting on 1/25/71, At that
meeting Mr, Mardian explained the absence of Judge Sharp by stating
there had been several inquiries made by acquaintances of Judge
Sharp in Congress which caused the Attorney General and White House
concern that it would be difficult to maintain appropriate security
concerning the Committee's work with Judge Sharp as its head and
in an office located so near The White House (Federal Office Building
Number Seven). Mardian stated that accordingly, at a meering Leld
1/21/71 at The White House, attended by Mardian, John W. Dean IIT,
the Attorney General, H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, it was
decided to have the Committee function in space occupied by the
Internal Security Division of the Department, 315 Ninth Street,
Northwest, and that Judge Sharp should be removed from the Committee
and assigned to other consultant duties with the Justice Department,
A copy of the 1/26/71 memorandum is also attached,

In addition to the above, it is my ownpersonal recollection
that Judge Sharp was very much concerned about the nature of his
assignment in that he frequently made trips to the State of
Washington and friends would ask him what type of work he was doing.
He said that he was never really able to give them a satisfactory
answer and this “bothered. him--somewhat.’- -

DECLASSIFICATION MATTER

On 2/19/74, Mr. Kevin Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney
General of the Criminal Division, contacted me and inquired whether
two prior FBI letters to the Department can now be declassified. The
items in question are our letters-to the Internal Security Division dated
1/27/7) and 2/3/71 both entitled“Intelligence Evaluation Committee,
Internal Security - Miscellaneous. " These letters both deal With’ the
issue of whether or not the FBI would provide personnel to staff the
Committee. They were classified on the grounds that disclosure of the
existence of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee could damage
national defense.

At the time these communications were prepared (1971) the White
House had indicated a desire to keep the existence of the Intelligence
Evaluation Committee secret. However, during the past year there has
been considerable publicity revealing nd only the existence of IEC but™
details of those operations. Hence, there is no longer any grounds for
retaining the classification of these communications. I advised Mr. Maroney

taken to so mark them,

Maroney desired declassification of these items in connection with
certain Departmental communications he is furnishing to the Senate

In his letter, Stanton indicates that he has already been furnished
certain information by the Justice Department. In view of this and the
fact that the IEC was operated under the Department's direction, it
is believed we should consult with the Attorney General before replying
to GAO. We do not ordinarily furnish the identities of FBI personnel on

specific assignments ta outsiders and GAO has not shown a specific
need for this data.

ACTION: Attached is letter to Attorney General with copy to Deputy Attorney
General advising of the GAO request and requesting the Attorney
General's observations. We are pointing out that we do not
ordinarily furnish identities of FBI personnel on specific

assignments but that we can make available the other data
requested, 7

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)
REQUEST OF GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE ON
BEHALF OF CONGRESSMAN ROYBAL

SUBJECT:

Reference is made to memorandum from A. B, Fulton to me, 7/26/74,
in captioned matter. You requested a memorandum be prepared outlining the
background and activities of the IEC.

On 11/25/70 Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian of the Internal
Security Division contacted Director J. Edgar Hoover, He advised that he had:
been commissioned by President Nixon to establish an Interdepartmental
|Inteuigence Unit for the purpose of pooling intelligence information from various
agencies regarding violent demonstrations or other efforts to overthrow the
Government. Mardian said the group had the support of Presidential Assistant
Ehrlichman, that it would operate from the Executive Office Building, and
would be headed by Morell/Sharp, a former judge. Mr. Hoover assured Mardian
Fe the FBI's cooperation and om12/1/70 Section Chief G. C. Moore of the

Intelligence Division was named as the FBI representative.

Ih December, 1970, and during the early months of 1971, several
meetings of the group were held in the office of John Dean, They were attended
by representatives of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, National
Security Agency (NSA), Secret Service, Defense Department, Treasury

’ Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Egil Krogh, Mr. Mardian, and Judge Sharp, At

the initial meeting, the group adopted the name "Intelligence Evaluation

Committee" and Mardian explained that it had been assigned the primary mission

of pooling information concerning political terrorism in the U, S, According to

.|Mardian, the, Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H, R, Haldeman at

' In late January, 1971, it was announced that Sharp was dropping out as i
head of IEC since his presence in the Executive Office Building had prompted press

~4inquiries, At the same time, it was decided to move JEC from the Executive Office
[punaing to the Internal Security Division of the Department and to place it under
the direction of a Departmental official, John Doherty.

One of the early problems facing the IRC was the question of staffing.
Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mardian to provide staff support.
However, on 5/17/71 Attorney General Mitchell requested in writing that the Bureau
provide two Agents and one secretary for the IEC working staff. Mr. Hoover
acceded to this request and two Intelligence Division supervisors (R, D, Cotter and
G. T, Tunstall) were designated with a secretary, FBI staff support continued
until dissolution of IEC on “6/11/73 (although beginning in July, 1972, one Agent was
recalled).

Other agencies also supplied limited support for IEC. During the first
year and one-half, the Defense Department provided a professional analyst and
during Summer of 1971 NSA furnished a full-time security specialist, Other agencies
also designated representatives who attended weekly staff meetings and furnished
assistance on a part-time basis. ase

i Following retirement of Doherty in September, 1971, IEC was headed by
aformer FBI Agent, Bernard F, Wells, with another ex-Agent, James McGraph, {
serving as his deputy.

: During the first part of 1971, IEC efforts were devoted primarily to i
preparing periodic intelligence estimates on antiwar activities and demonstrations j
and during 1972 a large part of the IEC's efforts was directed to preparing summaries |
of possible demonstrations at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. |

EC was pr eparing avariety of other reports of possible interest to the

the: evolvitig around” ‘possible civil disturbances. “This

luded reports dealing with the potential of racial violence and another.dealing
with prison disturbances.

One project undertaken by IEC deserves special mention. During July, 1971,
Mi rdian called a eeting of a8 and explained he had just returned from

Mardian indicated this had been prompted by the Ellsberg case but said IEC would

not concern itself with the Ellsberg matter from an investigative or prosecutive

T standpoint. He said the President wanted IEC to conduct an overall review of factors
relating to the protection of national defense information,

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Doherty reported that a White House staff member,
Gordon Liddy, had been named to work with IEC in handling this project. Liddy
met on one occasion, in August, 1971, with the IEC staff, and discussed the project
in general terms. In November, 1971, IEC published a special report entitled "The
Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information, " which completed this assignment.

Normally, IEC projects originated with John Dean, although there were some
exceptions such as a report on terrorist activities requested by the President's
Cabinet Committee on Terrorism. IEC estimates were furnished to Dean and the
heads of each member agency, inciuding the Attorney General,

There has been some speculation that the IEC was actually an outgrowth of =~
the so-called "Huston Plan" which had been briefly approved by President Nixon in
the Summer of 1970. This plan called for the lifting of various investigative
restraints on U. S, intelligence agencies (relating to covert mail coverage, wire-
taps, surreptitious entry, etc.) and also urged the formation of an interagency
intelligence group to keep The White House advised regarding matters of domestic
intelligence interest. This plan was scotched by The White House based on the
: strenuous | objections of FBI Director Hoover as well as Attorney General Mitchell.
owever, a memorandum prepared by John Dean in September, 1970, revived the
idea of an interagency intelligence group which would not only provide evaluations of
domestic intelligence for the President but which would also be operational in nature.
Circumstances indicate this memorandum was a forerunner to establishment of IEC,

Tt-should be, stressed; however, that at no time did IEC engage in any
activities of an operational nature nor did it make ariy recommendations for
operational activity. It concerned itself wholly with preparing summary-type
estimates based on data contributed by member agencies. FBI representatives on

the IEC have no knowledge whatever of anyspolitical ramifications in the activities
of this group.
