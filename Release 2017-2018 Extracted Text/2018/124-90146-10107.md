photostat of a transcript of a telephone conversation between Carlos|
Moore (and his friend Sandy Bethune) and the late Malcolm X, which!

On March 19, 1964, Kenheth B. Keating, United

States Senate, sent a letter to Frederick G, Dutton, i
Assistant Secretary of State, which enclosed a newspaper i
clipping from "The Christian Science Monitor" of March 5, |
1964, entitled "Peking Basé in Paris." This article i
describes the establishment ‘of an English languagé edition i
of a publication called "Revolution," committed to the |
Chinese Comiiunist point of view, and headed by Richard \
Gibson,’ Senator Keating's. letter stated, in part, that ;
Gibson was formerly Acting Executive Secretaty of’ the |
Fair Play for Cuba Committee in the United States. It i
further stated that Gibson appeared before the Senate

Internal Security Subcommittee on April 25, and May 16, :
1961, and consistently refused to answer any questions regarding |
his communist affiliations, -

Assued to Gibson on January 25, 1961, and stated that

"from the article it appears that this individual is now
using this passport to enable him to carry activities
against the United States through a Chinese Communist
network which reaches to various parts of the World. I
would appreciate your comments as to whether such activities
contribute to United States foreign policy objectives and,
if not, what.can be done to prevent such action by United
States citizens."

orderly conduct of United States relations within the meaning
of Section 51, 136 (b) of the Department's Passport
Regulations. In order to také any passport action under these
regulations, the activities must be of such a nature as to seri.
ously interfere with relations between the United States and
foreign governments and, under: existing regulations, the

fact must be established by evidence or witnesses at a

hearing in the Passport Office,"

By letter of April 28, 1964, Mr. Dutton advised
Senator Keating that "The Department's passport regulations
provide, in 22 C.F.R, 51. 136, for refusal of passport

States. If the newspaper clipping which you enclosed with
your letter accurately describes Mr. Gibson's present
activities in Paris, those activities obviously are not
helpful to United States foreign policy objectives, It is
another question, however, whether they are so.-prejudicial
to the orderly conduct of United States foreign relations
or the interests of the United States to justify the limitation
of passport facilities under Section 51, 136 of the
Department's regulations. On the. basis of available
information, the Department has concluded they are not.
However, we are asking our Embassy at Paris for information
regarding Mr. Gibson's activities. Any further information

we receive will, of course, be carefully considered in the
light.of the existing passport laws and regulations."

Robert E, Lee, Acting Assistant Secrétary For
Congressional Relations, sent a letter to Senator Keating on
September 30,°1964, which stated, in part, that "the
Suprene Court in the Flynn and Aptheker decisions rendered

moot the question of W- frawing Wr. Gibson's passport
because of alleged Communist activities. ..... the Flynn

and Aptheker cases concerned Section 6 of the Internal
Secu¥ity act of 1950 which (1) made it unlawful for any
member of a Communist organization to apply for a passport
or to use a passport, and (2) made it unlawful for any
officer or emplogée of the United States to issue a passport
to or to renew the passport of any individual knowing or.
having reason to believe that such individual is a member
of such organization. The Supreme Court held that Section 6
was unconstitutional because it swept too widely and too
indiscriminately across the freedom to travel guaranteed

in the Fifth Amendment."

reliable information in the past.\.

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10,1961,

Dr. Charles A, Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert
Taber as organizers of the FPCC, He also testified he and
Taber obtained funds from the Cubam Government which were
applied toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement .\,

On May 16, 1963, a source advised thatduring the
first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
imfluence FPCC policy, This source added that during the
past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC {eadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May,1963, was negligible. A

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive
Order 10450, NaN

m May 20, 1963, a second source advised that -

Vincent oped" Lee, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization, This source stated that Lee believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution
without interference from other nations, Lee did not “
advocate supporting the Cuban revolution per se, LAr

APPENDIX
FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator. Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chie? public relations instrument of
the Castro network: in the United States," It is to be noted
thatSenator Dodd was,a member‘ of the Senate Internal
Security Subcommit ‘which twice conducted hearings on

the FPCC, NS

The December. 27, 1963, edition of "The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street. rallies and mass picket lines, and the
direction-of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal
travel-to-Cuba campaigns, Its comparatively brief span of
life was attributed to mounting anti-Castro ‘American public
opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed |
FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and |
ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received from {
disclosure of. activities, on its behalf by suspected
presidential assassin Lee. H, Oswald,

On February 6, tge4, the previously mentioned
second source advised tha Vv, .T, Lee had recently. remarked that t
the FPCC was dead and tha here were no plans to organize
another similar organization. : Beetrraa
ek

‘On April 13, 1964,"a third source advisedthat
there had not been any FPCChactivity in many months. and
that the FPCC had been dissélved. :

SUBJECT: GIBSON, Richara—/o ~~

i. A usually relieble source had reported the following
summary of his conversation in London-in late December 1964"with |
Richard GIBSON, a free-lance writer, former Chairman of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee and former editor of the English ‘edition
of Révolution. GIBSON, a very light-skinned American negro
married to an Englishwoman, was working in the Columbia Broadcast-
ing System (CBS) newsroom when along vith another colleague, Robert
Yoder, he established the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in tHe early
1960's. GIBSON was in Cuba several times in 1961 and had met Fidel ~
Castro Ruz and Ernesto Guevara Serna, and various other Cuban

officials. ms
2. Richard GIBSON stated that he knew quite well Robert a *

i Willia she American Negro from Monroe, North Carolina, who het 1

emigrated to Cuba and now seems to commute between there and Peiping, .7 >> a |

China.

NS i 3. According to- GIBSON, he felt that the situation among Aner7f'

} dangerous.: He said that he had wet in both London and Paris quite a!

x few young American negroes in their late teens passing through en.

sabotage training. He further said he had the feeling that within

| six months to @ year these trainees would bégin infiltrating bach yg.

africaine in Algiers, which was then edited by Jacques Vergés.

es
When the Algerians removed Vergés, GIBSON stated that he followed Je Chek
é ener

Vergés to Paris where the latter set up Révo nm. According to

GIBSON, he served as editor of its Engl dianguage version first

in Paris and then in Lausanne, Switzerland, until a few months Bago,
when he split with Vergés, who still owes him money and whom he is
suing. Vergés himself loved French high society, good food and lux-
urfous living and spent-most of his time in political agitation. THe
magezine was in fact largely edited by a Vietnamese on its staff who
often wrote under other pséudonyms. The sale of the magazine was
actually quite small. The Chinese bought about 3,000 copies of each
issue but recently as many as 15,000 copigs of each issue were piling
up unsold in a garret in Paris. Andersen” in Lausanne was: definitely
a paid Chinese agent but he was on bad terms with Vergés.

Q

5. Source indicated that GIBSON seemed to-be a very relaxed and

quite-humorous negro intellectual. GIBSON said he had worked for
Revolution because of his interests in African and Asian independence
movements - had never considered himself a Communist and did not now.
Révolution, according to GIBSON, had many personal contacts with Trot-

skyltes and their was certainly considerable Trotskyite influence in it.

1. Headquarters Comment: Source is probably referring to Nils
Andersson of the la Cite publishing firm in Switzerland, which
printed the Revolution before it was banned in that country. He
has a continuing interest in Centre Lenine, 4 propaganda organ
reportedly sponsored by the Chinese Communists-
