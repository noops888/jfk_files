was concerned with administrative problems associated with the phase-

out of the Station.

Despite the consequent opcrational lull,

Subject

continued to maintain à saiisfactory

degrec of norale in agents assigied

him,

worked up and implemented realistic training programs,

and con

tinued. to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of

a policy

change.

In addition, important information colluted locally

by Subject on

11l0gl activities of Cuban refugces was of great interest

to other agencies offices in the arca.

Suoject was the only Station

source of such information which was acquired only because of Subject's

ability co maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the

period

becuse of the cutback in Infiltration operations.

It could also be noted as Subject finishes his

long tour at this

Station and propares for his next assignment, that he is a thoroughly

professional intelligence officer and is,

many ways, an outstandirg

one.

Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though

his

Special Forces

experience,

an expert on anti-gucrrilla varfare as

well.

Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport

with

foreign agents.

He has an imaginative approach to operations,

is resourcoful in devising tactics,

and determined in carrying out his

assignments.

As i former military officer,

Subject'is hard working and abundantly

sincere in his efforts to fight Communism. His

pertormance since Aug

19c1

has

not been at the top level of his capabilities

for sevoral reasous,

10t

all of which are withtn his abilley

to overcone. Subject has had

little clandestine training, and is therefore not always able to compre-

hend the intangible factors

which prevent, delay and cancel operations.

A further reason is the absence

of military lad as a busts for discipline

fordits men.

S6111 another

reason is the directire for only limited

ac Mon with

which he has had to live since August. This is

merely to say

that in a perlod of policy formation when

the action forces have had to

be held in limbo,

he has not been at his best.

Subject's dealings: with his arents have in tura been affected by his

own frustrations.

Ills inability to rationalize situations has resulted

in outuse explanations to them which have made then harder to handle.

His reluctance to put things on paper has detracted. from his performance

and denied him the clarifying process which reporsing provides.

security consciousness has been similarly affected by his frustrations.

Subjoct is in necd of training in tradecraft and PM opcrations. His

basic qualifications for PM Case Officer work are such that he can, with

tralning,

do a much better job.

This combined wich a program of concen-

trated

action would undoubtedly bring

out the best in him, which should

be of real value to the Agency.

REFIRZICE:

Grayrton L. Lynch

Me. Lynch's memorandun to

Director of Personnel, dated

22 June 1971.

1.

On the basis of what I can recall from the time I was

connected sith the Bay of Pigs aclivity and ray years with WH

Diviaion Inercafter, Mr. Lynch has slated his tasks correctly.

2.

Since the issue in whother Mr. Lynch's service in Miami

could be carbidered equivalent to that of an Operations Officer over-

the following might be considered:

l4r. Lynch had to oporate clardestinely.

He used pecudonyms, sufceites for mectings,

He handled, trained and dispitched agents. Ho

decritied them. He worked with thern side by aide.

He worked long, irregular hours (days and nighte)

urces unusual pressures and at personally inconvenient

and wrappealing sites.

ir. Lynch was, during the Bay of Pigs period at

least, in real personal danger. (Our case officers abroad

do ro: often face such situations nor do they have to diaplay

such courage.)

In summary, dir. Lyach's rasis were professionally

and personally more demanding than those di many of our

Operationa Officers abroad. He had io apply clandestine techniques

and concepts in a highly volatile and ditticult operational climate.

To admit him to thu CIA Rotirement System seems juatified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personsel

SUBJECT

: Recommendation for taproval of

Mr. Grayston b. Lizaras a Participant

in the CIA Retiremet: and Disability System

REFERENCE

: HR 20-50

It is strongly recommended that Ne. Grayston L. Lynch

be approved as a participant in the ClA Retirement and Disability

System.

2. It is the upinion of the Special Operations Division that

the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the lime he entered on duty

in February 1901 until carly 1908 meet the spirit and intent of ihe

criteria for "qualitying service" as delined is iR 20-50b. The lone

exception to these criteria is that Mr. Lynch was not "abroad"

during the time involved except on a sporadic basis. This exception,

however, was due completely to the geographical location of the area

This location made it uniquely propitious to have

Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a domestic base.

There is

no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's serrite was in the conduct

and support of covert operations which ¿guised continuing practico

of security and tradocraft procedures and which included, from

time to time, hazards to his life and health, it is also believed

that Mr. Lynch would be at a disadvantage in cotaining other employ-

ment because of the sensitivity of his past serice as well as the

dearth of reguirements for his peculiar background, skills and

knowledge.

3;

On the basis of the above and MI. Lynch's unique per.

sonal record, it is believed that his service wring the described

period is certainly equivalent to if not in cacess oi the requirements

for "creditable service abroad" and that if it kal not been for a

geographical accidont, this service would hare been performed as

Mr. Grayston lo. Lynchis i Career Agent sine entered on duty

inde die Agency in Pobruary 196l and served in

prepring Wil Agent assets due operational

assements. In March 1961 he lett

aboard a covert Agency

vessel for Nicaragua where he assisted in the preparation of Agency vesselo

argasses acheduled for operations into Cuba, in April 1961, he left

Nicaraguis on a Aguncy veggel lo participate in the landing operations in

the Bay of Pigs, Cibi.

He was let involved in artel action both at sea

ise al shrere during the four days of the invasion stainpt and, from direct

Instructions from the DCI encased in series of covert landings and opora.

ine into Cuba for severál digs following the invasion Landing. For this

action ir. Lynch anassessess received the Ineellizence Star. Mr. Lynch

ariesequently served as i paramilitary operations dificer at Miami, Florida

rail approximately June 1968.

During this perim he participated in

risse rous clandestiog ctivitian including agent training. parachute training,

weapono training as planner ind dirocted 115 actini cocrations into Cuba.

This has resulted in a medical hold being paced on Mr. Lynch

lot ny overscas assignment CS or TDY, Since he is uniquely a field

spend operationo vificer there are literally no departmental duties to which

he can be assigned. Since there in no suitable asatement available for

Mo, Lynch it is necesnary to terminate Mi. Lynch's contractas à Career

Since he is eligible for Involuntary Retiremem under CLARDS, Mr.

lynica bas made application for retirement effectice 10 September 1971.

In view of Mr. Lynch's age, specialised skills, long cervice in a uniquely

arsilive area, and peculiar contribution to the Agency's mission it is

believed that a termination bonus it the time of his retirement is fully

warrailed.

Mr. Lynch is currently the equivalent of a 05-14, step 5 with in

salary of 923;591.

The proposed $10, 000 cermination bonus represents

clerefore, less than 12% of his annual salary or approximately 5 months

pay. Is connection with this, it should be noted ths: if he vere being termina-

led rather than retiring, he would be entitled by vicvie of the providions of

hiis contract to 90 days notice which would equal approximately 56. 000 at

his current rate of pay in salary alone. Additioral triage benefits would

increase this figure.

:. Ma. Grayston

Lyach

Assuming no interruptions or changes of 248151-

ment or status in the

trainins, in

mid-April 1971. Between now and then it is understood

i no nore in a AN and with matoret

thoroby, in due, course, quality sedically for toY or pos

ovciseas fiuld duty.

In view of Mi, Lynch's past history, however,

we cannot assume that he will be succossful

or will even

actively pross to overcome his problem.

In spite of his

carecr agent status and his operational performance

(Intelligence Star'), we cannot,

in all conscience, carry

him on SOD contract volls indefinitoly in an unproductive

capacity.

He has completed all of the advanced and re-

tresher operations training necessary to qualify for

assignment now.

Ho has not adapted woll nor has he been

receptive to the kinds of headquarters duty assignnents

open to him.

He is a field paracilitary officer.

3.. It is prudent, therefore, to begin contin-

gency plinuing now for his appropriate rottronent and

outplacement into a job which will offer him both security

and porsonal satisfaction.

His Spanish langinge training

should enlarse his

horizons and opportunitics.

prodict he will not, at least at first,

take at all kindly

idea of retirement and relinquishing his Agency

association.

He is enotionally involved,

hinself as an Agency career fiold oporations officer.

1. Please acquaint C/CSPS and DDPJO with the back-

ground

of this case,

together with them begin

now to

The mission to to adapt current assets into a force

which can enter the target area by sea or air to conduct recon

naissance, caching, sabotage, raids and/or guerrilla warfaro

support operations.

The organizational concept to be tollowed is that of

small teams which

function independently or in combination

and entirely

under indigenous leadership.

All personnel should

be fully qualified in basic paramilitary skills and should bo

physically and mentally prepared to mount operations on short

Airborne capabilities will be developed when facilities

necessary for training become available.

The standards for members of the group should be con-

stantly upgraded by culling of members who become marginal or who

do not develop as expected.

Recruitment uf promising now members

will be dopendent on the needs of the station based

on policy

Priority should be given to sabotago training to

permit the mounting of a sabotage program at the carliest possible

moment.

Coincidentally, planning. and thought should be given to

the topics of cover, recruitment, training and establishment of

those facilitles necessary for a rapid expansion of the group if

a full scale operational program should be developed.. Also,

the

force should be identified to the primary exile authority as a

non political and independent body which is unilaterally engaged

in the overthrow of the

existing regime.

The tempo of training

at a level sufficient to assure the continual

proficiency

of the group in all categories of activity in icadiness

for the order to mount a full scale program with all teams parti

cipating simultaneously. Readiness will not itself be justifica

It appears clear to the wittor that any housing allowance

which

applies to staffers also applios to the writer.

This would

then necessarily have to commence at the samo time for both typos

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT:

Fulicy Concerning Guests at Award Ceremonies

1.

The Olice of the Director has determined that when inviting

guests to award cersmonies, the Agency will be as liberal as possible

within the bounds i trailable space and security considerations since

one of the purposes s an award ceremony is to let the family, friends,

and associates oi the recipient know that he has been honored.

2.

In implemeating this policy the points listed below will be

quiding criteria:

a. Any Agascy employee who is a friend uf a recipient

may come to c ceremony, up to the limit of space available,

If the recipier asks that he be present.

b. Any Gazernment employee (who is not employed by the

Agency but wha is witting of the recipient's employment) can

come so long as there are no operational security ressons that

would make büs gresence Inappropriate.

c. Any insaed who is not employed by the Government inay

be invited onir = it is obviously desirable (Example-- A-very

close old frien: wino stood in the relationship of "lamily" to the

recipient wher sabject had no immediate family). Friends who

are not emplared by the Government normally would be

discouraged.
