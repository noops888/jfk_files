a poliey change, In addition, importaat information collected locally
by Subject on Lllogal activities of Cuban ‘refugees was of great interest

source of such Laformtion whi acquired only because of Subject's

As a forme

milltary officer, Subject ‘is hard working and abundantly
cin his efforts, to Light Communism. His performance since Aus 1961
has hot been at the Lop level of his capabilities fer several reasons

not all of which are within his ability to overcene. Subject has had
little clandestine training, and is therefore not always able to conpre=
hend the intangible factors which prevent, delay and cancel operations.

A further reason is the absence of military law as a basis for discipline
fordiis mon, Stall another reason ig the directive for only Limited

on with which he has had to live since August. This is merely to say
t¥at in-a period of policy formation when the action forces have had to
be held ih Limbo, he has not been at his best.

Subject ’s dealings ;with his agents have in tura been affected by his
own frustrations. His inability to rationalize situations has resulted
dn obtuse explanations to them which have made then harder to handle.
His reluctance to’ put things on paper has detracted from his performance
and denicd him the clarifying process which reporting provides. His
Security consciousness has been similarly affected by his frustrations,

Subjoct 1s in need of training in tradecraft azd PM operations. His
basic qualifications for PM Case Otficer work are such that he can,with
training, do a much better Job, ‘This combined with a program of concen=
trated action would undoubtedly bring out the best in him, which should
be of real value to the Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Perso:

SUBJECT : Recommendation Zor Agproval of
Mr, Grayston L, Lyzci as a Participant
in the CIA Retiremezi aad Disability System
REFERENCE : HR 20-50

1, It ie strongly recommended that Wz. Grayston L, Lynch
be approved as a participant in the CLA Retirement and Disability
Systern,

2, It is the opinion of the Special Opezations Division that
the duties performed by Mr, Lynch from the ime he entered on duty i
in February 1961 until carly 1968 meet the spizit ard intent of the
criteria for qualitying service! as defined is iR 20-50b, The lone
exception to these criteria is that Mr, Lynch was not "abroad"
during the time involved except on a sporadic basis, This exception,
however, was due completely to the geograptical location of the area
of operations, This location made it uniquely propitious to have
Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a dowsstic base. There is
no question, however, that Mr, Lynch's service: was in the conduct
and support of covert operations which reguized continuing practice
of security and tradecraft procedures and w included, from
time to time, hazards to his life and health, itis also believed
that Mr: Lynch would be at a disadvantage in cbtaining other employ-
ment because of the sensitivity of his past serrice as well a the c
dearth of requirements for his peculiar backgzound, skills and

knowledge.

yachts unique per=

3. On the basis of the above and Mz.
cing the described

sonal record, it is believed that his service

period is certainly equivalent to if not in excess of the requirements

for "creditable service abroad" and that if it Sad not been for a
geographical accident, this service would havz been performed as



ee

art of an assignment abroad within the (ullest meaning of the definis
\ : referent regulation, ‘Therefore, approval of

Mr, Lynch's request for designation aw a participant in the CLARDS
‘on the basis of bervice performed Letween 1961 and 1968 ia not only
wtrongly recorirnended but is requested as the grant of an entitlement
fally carned by a very deserving employee.

Mr. Grayston L. Lynchis a Caroer Ayent “hy entered on duty

vel for Nicucagua where he awsisted in the preperation of Agency vessels
and sosety scheduled for operations into Cuba, in April 1961, he lett

Nica ragui O18 Agency vessel ty participate in the landing operations in
Bay-of Pigs, Cuba. He was BBB involved in arsed action both at sea

at phore during the four days of the invasion ateenpt and,from direct
fnsteuctions from the DCI in series of covert Jandings and opera-
tigne into Cuba for several days following the invasion landing. For this
activa Mr, Lynch eubmamemagty received the Intelligence Star. Mr, Lynch
sobsequently served as a paramilitary operations efficer at Miami, Florida

J approximately June i968. During this peria articipated in

perce rous clandestipg vctivities including agent traizing, parachute training,
wea vons training, wat plinned and directed MS actual vperations into Cuba,

ar.

This hay resulted in a medical hold being placed on Mr. Lynch
for any overseas ansigament MCS or TDY. Since he is uniquely a field
Syeeiod Cperativns officer there are diterally no «te; ntal duties to which
he can be assigned, Since thers: ia no suitable ass at available for
Mr, Lynch it {s neceanary to terminate Mr. Lynch's contract as a Career
Agent. Since he is cligible for Involuntary Retirement under CIARDS, Mr.
Lynch bas made application for retirement effective 10 September 197L.

In view of Mr, Lynch's age, specialized skills, Weng eervice ina uniquely
ve area, and peculiar contribution to the Agency's mission it is
d that a termination bonus at the time of his retirement is fully

Mr. Lynch is currently the equivalent of a GS-14, step 5 with an
anus! salary of $23,591. The proposed $10, 000 termination bonus represents
therefore, less than 42% of his annual salary or approximately 5 months
pay. 1p connection with this, it should be noted th were being termina -
ted rather than retiring, he would be entitled by vi of the provisions of
his contract to 90 days notice which would equal ap. mately $6,000 at
his current rate of pay in salary alone. Additions benefits would
increase this figure.

fresher operations training ne ry to qualify for

receptive to the kinds of headquarters duty a#s ignments

3.. Tt is prudent, therefore, to begin contin-

“however, was due complotely to the geographical location of the area

Mr. -Lynch asoigned to und work out via domestic base. There le
no question, however, that Mr, Lynch's aorvice waa tn the conduct

MEMORANDUM FOR :

SUBJECT i Letter of Instruction

1. This memorandum is to confirm your appointment as Chieg,

AMLILAC and to provide you with instructions for the direction of
that group,

2, The mission 4s \to adapt current assets into a force
which can enter the target areca by sea or air to conduct recon
naissance, caching, sabotage, raids and/or guorrilla warfare
support operations. i

3. The organizational concept to be followed is that of
small teams which can function independently ox in combination
and entirely under indigenous leadership, All personnel should
be fully qualified in basic paramilitary skills and should be
physically and mentally prepared to mount operations on short
notice. Airborne capabilities will be developed when facilities
necessary for training become. available,

<1. 4s The standards for members of the group should be con-
stantly upgraded by culling of members who become marginal or who
do not develop as expécted. Recruitment vf promising now members
will be dependent on the needs of the station based on policy
directives, Priority should be given to sabotage training to
permit the mounting of a sabvtage. program at the carlicst possible
moment. Coincidentally, planning“and thought should be given to
the ‘topics of cover, recruitment, training and establishment of
those facilities necessary for a‘ rapid expansion of the group if

a full scale operational program should be developed. . Also, the
force should be identified to the primary exile authority ag a

non political and independent body which is unilaterally engaged

in the overthrow of the existing regime, The tempo of training
should be maintained at a level sufficient to assure the continual
proficiency of the group in all categories of activity in readiness
for the order to mount a full scale program with all teams parti-

cipating simultaneously, Readiness will not itself be justifica-
tion for operations,

5. Your staf€ must be organized to permit close contact
with team members so as "to assure control over them and at the
same time provide full security for the existence of your organi~
zation. It must also provide security for the planning of all
activities in such a way ay to assure the compartmentation of
staff and team personnel associated with the different categories
of operational activity.

G. The following guide lines are provided for thu organi-
zation:

a, The size and military nature of the force
require that the highest possible standard of security
be maintained for all personnel and activities. Speci-
fically, the scope should not be comprehended by team
nembers, and compartmentation by teams should be
practiced to the maximum, ~

b. Should, 1f possible, be composed of men who
have no dependents.

7. The following tasks should be undertaken immediately:

a. Continue development of cover for all
personnel, their absences, injuries, deaths.

b. Continue the development of concepts to.
provide for training, during active and tnactive
periods, transportation to training and staging
areas and safehouse utilization,

c. Continue to devise procedures for handling and
storage of classified material, arms and cquipment.

d. Establish standards for recruitmont, disciplino,
chain of command and security.

“Allowance: You will be entitled to: (a) living quarters allow-
ance in- conformance with applicable government regulations. You
may be provided quarters by ‘your cover facility or the government
and, in Such event, you will not be entitled to the living quarters
allowance herein indicated.

able government regulations including, but not limited to, a post
allowance or an equalization allowanco in liow thereof, a supple-
mentary post allowance,.a transfer allowance, a basic service
transfer allowance, an education allowanco, and a separation
allowance."

2, It appears clear to the writer that any housing allowance
which applies to ‘staffers also applios to tho writer. This would
then necessarily have to commence at the same time for both types
in order to be equal.

3. It is requested the writers’ housing allowance be timed
to commence on the Same date as the Staffers in order to comply
