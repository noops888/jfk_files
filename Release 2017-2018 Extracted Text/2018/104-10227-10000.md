IDENTIFICATION:

BACKGROUND

APPROVAL

Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
er who defected-in 1964 and
quently involuntarily con-

was sub
fined in the U.S. by the Agency for
a period of approximately three years,

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962

and subsequently defected. in January
1964. | NOSENKO was brought to the IS,
fter a period of relative freedom
involuntarily confined in

April 1964, From April 1964: to

August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site in Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1968 to

October No: $ confined

at In October
19) was returned to the Washington
area, given increasing amounts of
freedom until he was al free-
dom in April 1969. NOSENKO be,

U.S. citizen in April 1974,
employed by the Agency. as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. ilis present
sdlary is $23,500 per year.

(1) The legal basis to confine NOSE
against his will was discussed by
Mr. Richard Helms, Db/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
Proper (Tab 2).

(2) There are a series of letters from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3),

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's conf ine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 § 5),



RESULTS : Ky memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DUCE summarizing
the results of the NOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Both reports conclude that-NOSENKO

‘was a bona fide defector, A draft

“ memorandum attached to this file,

dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raisés question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challenges the above two reports.

TERMINATION : NOSENKO continues under contract to
the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.
No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

COMMENTS : - (1) While the Office of Security files

7 do document the rationsle for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time,
A memorandum dated S August 1969 states
that various congressio staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.

During this trip, Agency personnel, with

apparent Headquarters approval, obtained :
the services of prostitutes. This

apparently occurred on at least two

occasions.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Discussion with Deputy Attorney:
General on Nosenko Case

1, Hr Helzs, Mr. Houston and Nr. Murphy met with
the Deputy Attornoy Goneral and nesbers of his staff to
discuss subject case, Present from Mr. Katzenbach's
staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeugley and Reis.

: 2. Mr. Holas explained the Nosenko case briefly
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two problems on which we
would like the advice of tha Departsent of Justice.
First, wo would seoon feel coapelled to begin hostile
interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth
with respect to his mission for the KG3 and we wonderod
what the legal position would be in circusstances in
which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pure
pose, Second, wo would have to be ready after detorain-
ing ‘that we could obtain no additional inforgation fros
Nosenko to deport hin... We had thought of taking hin to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Borlin
where this has been done:a number of tincs in the past.

_ + 3. There was soso discussion of whether deportation

to another country aight be a consideration, Nr. Helas

explained we would probably face publicity problems in -... te
deporting to a third country of the kind we would en- 1
counter if hé ware freo in the U. S. Nr. Helms noted

there were many items of .inforsation which and the

FBI realize are of no significance because of the file

holdings.wo have but which an unscrupulous newspapor san

could use to create nischief, This aspect was then dropped

and it was the consensus that 3erlin was probably the best

place. .

4, The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and relatod by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under
cwhich Nosenko is in this country. He is here as an “ox-
clusion and parole case” which ins he has not been
adaitted and has been parolad to the Agency which is
Tesponsiblo for hin while he is in this country... This



parole can-be interproted to mean parole to a specific
locale which would provide sone justification for our.
detaining hia for questioning, It was then pointed out,
however, that if he ‘said,he wished to leave the country
to re m to. the. Soviet Union, technically we would not
be ablé’to detain hin further. In this event, wo would
bevfaced with the. nced-to deport his quickly and quietly
.. and for this purpose. the ianigration warrant of arrest
“and deportation was probably the best instrudent.

Se Ur. Katzenbach asked Hr, Foley to check into .
this and Mr. Foley will in turn contact Mr, Houston.
Mr. Houston will in turn discuss tho problem with CIA
Office of Security officials to get the background -of
their liaison with the INS on: these matters,

6. Mr. Holes thanked. Mr, Xatzenbach for his assistance
and we departed amid sone jovial banter with respect to
"The. Spy Who Camo in From the Cold” about what we expected
to happen to him when he started to climb aver that “wall”

aca 1, On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department
+ of Justice on the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred : i
pron arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency,
i was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible
for taki: i any action necessary to Sarty out the terms of the parole,

omc z' At You know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the
Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955, After setting up
Sonditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:
“After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume *
xesponsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind aed degree it
believes consistent with the internal Security needs of the United States
during Continuance of thelr parole status." This means that the
gcsponsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary
to protect the internal Security needs of the United.States. Tha word
"minimum" ia not necessarily a limitation, It merely means that good
judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary,

3+ Tho agreement further provides that upon completion of the
parolee!s intelligence or opezational purposes in the United States or if ;
internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from :
this country through arrangements made by the Agency ang, in such” ;

Question #3 - Did McCone or Raborn have any information on this:

What? i

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SH Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Noscnko until late
October: 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the
Office of Security by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was
at leust generally aware of the confinement of Nosenko and the
conditions of confinement, but any definite statement must be

based on SE records.

Question #4 - Where is Nosenko working now?

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at hls personally owned
residence in North Carolina. tle is engaged in research and
analytical work based on his previous knowledge of the KGB
and other Sovict matters. lic is in the Washington, D. C. area
for several days approximately every six weeks for direct
interviews by the FBI and Office of Security personnel.

Question #5 - Is he working for CIA?

- Answers

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a‘-full-time
contractual basis since 1 March 1969, The original contract
has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration,
primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. In late
1972, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for salary
not received du g the 1 April 1964 to 1 March 1969. In addition,:
on 12 July 1973 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release
of the United States.Government and the Central Intelligence
Agency from any claims prior to that date.

Question #6 - What is his legal status?

Answer:

Nosenko was naturalized as a United States citizen in
April 1974,

SEGREL,

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Inspector General

“SUBJECT : The Nosenko Case

Attached please find a summary of a document written in
1967 to’the General Counsel outlining the Nosenko case and
explaining to him actions which had been taken with regard to
Nosenko. . As noted in the first par: auph, in October 1967
Nosenko took up residence in the Washington arca and was
advised that, should he wish to leave the apartment for any
_location whatsoever, he was free to so do. In other words,
from that date, Nosenko was essentially a totally free man.
’That he chose not to flee in any way may be indicative of his
attitude toward the manner in which he was handled prior to
October 1967. #

While one can criticize the fact that Noscnko was kept
incommunicado for approximately three years, and therefore
presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document
does indicate, we believe, that the Agency was on the horns
of a dilemna in this regard. There were legitimate doubts
about, Hosenko's bona fides and concern that he was a Soviet
plant. There. was no Country.to which he could be deported
save the Soviet Union, and Nosenko himself refused to return
there. Yet, in the United States, save when isolated from
society, he was considered to be a continuing threat to
national security.

Recognizing that only legal experts can judge defini-
tively the merits of the case, it seems to the writer that
the Agency had. no choice but to hold Nosenko incommunicado
pending resolution of his bona fides. Ne was admitted to
the United States under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (S$)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, namely as a parolee
to the Agency. As a parolee, Nosenko de facto from the date
of his entry to the United States did not enjoy the full civil
rights of the normal citizen. lle was a ward of the Agency, in
a sense, and the ency was ultimately responsible for his

i
conduct. There were at the time very legitimate reasons: to
believe that full and total release of Nosenko would be an
abrogation by the Agency of its legal responsibility To
gainsay that d ion in retrospect is, we be ve, an error,
In sum, the act of defection places the defector at the mercy
of the laws of the country to which he defects. It is the
obligation of the accepting country to see to it that the
laws are followed In the Nosenko cause, it secs to us that
the Agency acted in a fully responsible manner to ensure that
its responsibility for the defector was met. While it was
unfortunate that it took so long to resolve the matter, we
can find no fault with the fact that the Agency met its
responsibility to both the United States and to Nosenko

himself.

again in January 1964 as the security officer for the Soviet
disarmament delegation, After a number of mectings with his
CIA handlers he defected on $ February. 1964 and was secretly
taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border
on the night of 4/5 February with alias U.S. Arny identity
documents. In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,
Nosenko wrote out’ an asylum Tequest, requesting political
asylum from the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides-had
arisen on the basis ‘of the information he had provided both
in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-
inally planned to do a detailed bona fides debricfing and
assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving

Nosenko to the United States. However, unpree uted action

by the Soviet. Government in Tespect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the
Press that Nosenko, described as an “expert attached to the
Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected,

: - SECRET .
Because of mounting pressure ‘from the press, which included
much speculation that Noscnko was a high level scientist or
disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department
would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's
request for asylum in the U.S. and identifying him’as a
member of the KGB. ‘This was done on 10 February. On 1L Feb-
ruary, the Soviet Government delivered a note to.the American
Embassy in Moscow asking, how Nosenko left Switzerland and
requesting an immediate interview with him and his release.

On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-
ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in-Geneva in which he
accused-the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in
locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected
these charges, the American Anbassador to Switzerland recom-
mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko
to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of
his own free will. ,

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,

Nosenko was brought to the United States. He travelled by

out for evening and week-end excursions, Nosenko was -at all
times accompanied by O/S personnel. In addition, he took @
two-week vacation to Hawaii, again accompanied by caso offi-

he was a KGB Pera and at the same time it became obvious
that it would be impossible to proceed_further to. resolve
the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen
without changing the conditions in which he was being held.
Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially
when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed’
for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance
of an alien registration card. At the same time, Nosenko's
heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing
increasing difficulties to the security personnel charged with
keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in
accordance with Agency local responsibility. It was clear
that it was only a matter of time before he created a public
scandal, More importantly, he was in a position to communi-

established contact with CIA, subscquently defected on KGB
instructions, and that he came to the United States on a
deception mission. The implications of this mission had a
grave and “direct/bearing on U.S. national security. Although
our findings were supported by the results of two polygraph
examinations, the nature of the evidence was inadmissable in
a court of law. In any case, it is clear that Nosenko had
not been in a position to perform any overt act of ‘transgres-
sion of U.S. espionage laws since 4 April 1964 whéh he was

placed ina restricted area and deprived of any conceivable

means of communication with the KGB.
Nosenko did not admit that he defected on KGB orders

or that he came to the U.S. on a KGB mission, He has admitted,

however, that he made numerous lies about-his personal history
and about the details of his KGB service to U.S. officials,
both before and after arriving in the United States.

to have tiie time to analyze and resolve this case, and to

plan and execute ‘appropriate countermeasures, it was essential
that we attempt to keep the KGB from learning of our awareness
of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of ‘the depth and Scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and
the implications thereof, was restricted tu a very few people
in the Agency and the intelligence community. Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-
ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the Soviets
were making a serious effort'to find out what happened to
Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant
and unusual of these was the approach by a Soviet journalist,
Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the French magazine
Paris Match with an offer to provide photographs and materials
for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family. According

to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach to an

international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain
compensation from Nosenko for’ damages caused by his abandon-
ment of her and her children., In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be from Nosenko himself,

i

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach to repre-
sent blatant and crucl manipulation of his family by the KGB
and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing
to an interview or in any other way.
Nosenko's Status —
To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on
12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions
of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act. Parole résponsibility is delegated to the Agency by
the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed
by the Attorney General and the E71 on 10 February 1955,
which states:
“After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel- eee 7
ligence Agency will assume responsibility for
care, supervison and control of a kind and
degree it believes consistent with the internal
security needs of the United States during con-
tinuance of their parole status."
In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and
because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious
and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we
ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

States, From 12 February to 4 April 1964 it possible to
keep Nosenko at a location where he could enjoy a certain
‘amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.
After 4 April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was
necessary to keep him incommunicado at.a location which is
known to no one outside of the Agency (and to very few within

under the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically
extended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his freedom of movement had been severely
restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and. he made no com-
Plaint about his treatment. “On the contrary, we had several
written statements from him in which he stated that our.
handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous
occasions that.he will never contemplate return to the USSR,
and, although we suspect that. he might secretly welcome such
fA move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end
with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,
etc. When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with
Department of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of
State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for

might have backfired very badly. Another point that had to
be considered was the possibility that the sovicts, again
playing their part, might have refused to accept Noscnko on
the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.

Third Country: Although we believed it likely that

NOSENKO, AELADLE,|CELOTEX I and If

and MOCKINGBIRD

Forwarded herewith is a 31 December 1974 memorandum

Acting Director of Security on subject activities. The

Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON .

We should spell out what is meant by the *
statement that the FBI "deferred further coveragé
to the Office of Security," how it was expressed and
what form it took.

The taping of two conversations docs not seem
to constitute "electronic surveillance” in the usual
sense, It certainly is not trespatory surveillance,
A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted,

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI
knowledge, and report such information as we get.

AELADLE :

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry,



CELOTEX 1

— We will want more detail on the actual
surveillance, including possible higher approval.

This is responsive to the DCI's request for
newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

i GELOTEX It

Questions similar to CELOTEX L

We may wait 5
stories for display, in addition to memos, should: A
DCL wish to use it.

MOCKINGBIRD-

No recorded (in CIA) formal approval by
Attorney General. It may be that Justice will
have a copy.

Does this raise a question of surveillance*
of congressmen if one is contacted by.someone -
under surveillance? .. :

: Alleged Illegal Activities
(Unidentified Subject--Alleged Abuse
of Defector) Paaranatte -

1. Reference is made to Mr. Ainslie's verbal request
for a review of Office of Security files in an effort to
Provide information pertinent to a case mentioned on page
170 of the.Report to the President by the Commission on CIA
activities within the United States,

2, The case in question from Page 170 of the Commission
Report is quoted as follows: "In one other case, a defector’ 7
was physically ‘abused, although not seriously injured, The
Direct, £ lst igencesdisch: t “mp loy

3. A search of Office of Security file resources has
reflected information Pertinent to a case ih which a defector
wias-physically- abused-at-an-oversea ocation, and the “Agency”
employee was later terminated by the DCI. It is not known
whether the following case is identical to the referenced
case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts
appear to be quite similar,

4, Information developed by this Office of possible in-
terest to the Inspector General, pertains to one John Torpats,
an ex-CIA ecinployee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

S.. Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926. Torpats was employed by
CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961, | The
file information reflected that in July 1956, Torpats was found
guilty of mistreatment of an alien by a Special Inquiry Board

in Frankfurt, West Germany. The alien involved was Eduard
Oun, 7 Estonian who defected from Estonia through Sweden
in 1955.

4 6. The incident in Frankfurt involved wistreatment of

: Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats. The charges
of physical abuse included the striking of Oun with the fist;
application of turpentine and ointments to various parts of
the body, the scrubbing of Oun's body wi

later recommendation included reduction in grade from GS-14

Ports and engsged in various "in house" Battles with Agency
officials concerning his employment.

: 8. Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the
authority granted the DCI under Section 162(Cy of the National

9. The Office of Security file of Eduard oun contained
little information other than interrogation reports dated 1956,
It was not clear from file information whether Oun entered the
United States after the Frankfurt incident, The most recent
document contained in the Oun file was dated 17 September

1956 and noted that Oun had been psychiatrically examined and
found qualified for Agency sponsored immigration to the U.S.
under Public Law 203, °

10. It is noted that Office of Security files contained
only fragmentary information in regard to certain areas of the
Torpats' case,. File Teview indicated, however, the DDO, OGC

al information concerning this matter,

Nosenko: In England I was for ten and fifteen days .26.3- 02

Note: During the interrogation of Nosenko in 1964, he denied that he ever
said that he was in the United States.

2, You stated previously that while traveling to England and Cuba, you were
"documented as Nikolayev, Under what cover did you traval to those countries?
What was your Legend-Biography?
Note: Any KGB officer going abroad under another name and under

omitted "the fact" that he was a son of a Minister because.
there was no Minister of Shipbuilding Industry with the name

of Nikolayev, etc. , etc.)

traveling to the USSR. __

Didn't you know or remember how-Oswald's visa was processed and
from what country Oswald entéred the USSR? Is it possible that he

entered the USSR on a "podvisnaya" visa?

You previously said that you saw Oswald'e viea application, but you could
not say from what countey Oswald came to the USSR. In your opinion, is

It possible that Oswald received his visa application in somé other Europeda
country, then went to Finland and through Finland entered the USSR without
contacting the Soviet consulate in Helsinki? Did you hear any talk about the
possibility that is described above? If so, when did you hear it and from
whom?
On 3 July 1964 you stated that you have seen Oswald's anketa (visa
application), Do you remember what was in that anketa? Did you read
the anketa? What did you mean that you saw the anketa? Was it in the
name Lee Harvey Oswald, or was there another name? Did you see the

name of the person who signed the anketa?

According to your previous information, “any tourivt = he buya a tour

to the Soviet Union, makes out the aAnkela, and then comen ta Moscow,"

In what country did Ouwald buy a tour to the USSR? In what country did

Oswald fill in the anketa? If the anketa Bees to Moscow, to what office

in Moscow does it go? To MID, KGIS? Is It possible that all the data on

Oswald from his anketa was sent to Moscow by a cable? “Did you see and
P > va .

read Oswald's anketa or a telegram that Oswald Is coming to Moucow?

If you did not read the anketa, who arnony the KGB officers of the Second

Chief Directorate or the First Chief Directorate read the anketa or had
access to it? Who would logically have access to the anketa?

According to your previous information, any person who wants to visit the

USSR has to buy a tour in a forcign touriat fiem in hie home country or any
tay in

other country, and the tourist firm’ will make arrangements for hie

the USSR. It is understood that he must fill in the anketa, and in addition to

the general questions, the common tourist should make requests for the

cities he intends to visit and for the accommodations he wants. The tourist

a his date of arrival in -’.. ~

would know in advance when he receives hie vis,
*

Moscow, in what hotel -he is going to stay, and what kind of accommodations

he would be given, The question, then, is do you know when Intourlst

received Oswald's request and application and when it answered him that

his demands are met and that he is welcome in Moscow?

From your knowledge, when Oswald arrived in Moscow, was he handled by

the Intourist Agency or by Sputnik, the Youth Tourist Bureau of the uSSR,

Central Council for Tourism of the Soviet Trade Unions? *

The Central Council for Tourism of the Soviet Trade Unions organizes
exchanges of tourists between trade unions of the USSR and other
countries, Sputnik was organized in June 1958 for the exchange of

of tourists (students and other youths),

You stated previously that Oswald wan not conaidered a defector, If he

If the KGB did not consider Oswald to be a defector, then it is
possible that Oswald was known to the KGB long before his arrival

in the USSR as a tourist and Oswald was assured that when he
arrived in the USSR he would be given Soviet citizenship or at.
least a permanent residence permit, Although he would be a defector
anyway, it could be that Oswald did not like the word defector

and the KGB decided not to call him a defector but, Ict us say, a
volunteer, The Soviet-Constitution states that the USSR grants the
right of asylum to all foreign citizens "uto are persecuted for
safeguarding the interests of the working claya or who are persecuted
for scientific activities, for national-lileration struggle." (Article
129 of the USSR Constitution of 1936.)

You stated previously that "since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador

Soviet government that the ambassador would be personally involved in

issuing a visa to Oswald?

Note? “It is’ knowa that in 1957 the Soviet government adopted some tneasures
to improve travel for foroign tourists in the USSR, They rnostly i
concerned currency'exchange. The 1957 regulations said nothing
about visas, Nosenke should be questioned about the 1957 decision

of the Soviet government to determine if he is not mistaking the 1957
decision with that of 1960, f

You stated previously that since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador
can give visas. in from three to five daye, The available information
published by the Soviets unmistakenly states that a visa cannot be obtained

in less than'seven days (in some cases it takes five to seven days). Following

are excerpts from a book entitled Moscow, A Tourists Companion, published
in Moscow in 1969, and from the magazine Soviet Life, May 1978, p. 59.
Soviet Life stated that “visas are issued within 10 days of receipt of

application at a Soviet consulate,"

Maj. General Stepan Alekueyevich Smorodinakiy - KGB (State Security) 1962-

weer eesensee Ivan Leopoldovich Lysakovskly.- KGB-(State Security) 1971-

2.. What do you know about Aleksandr Nikiforovich Aksenev?

(a) Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of the KGB of Beloruasia
from 1959 to 1960, It is assumed that when Oswald arrived

in Minsk in January 1960, Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of

of the KGB and would definitely know about the Oswald case.
From 1960 to 1965, Aksenov was MVD Minister of Belorussia.
Therefore it would be under his direction that Oswald's passport
and the departure of Oswald and Marina from Minsk was
arranged. If Nosenko had acceas to Oswald's file, he must

know about Aksenov, From 1965 to 1971, Aksenov was First
Secretary of the Vitebsk Obkom of CP Belorussia, and since
1971, Aksenov has been Sccond Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Belorussian CP, He has been a member of

the CC CPSU since 1976, and he is also a deputy to the USSR
Supreme.Soviet, On May 9, 1978, Aksenov arrived in Columbia
He headed the Soviet delegation on the invitation of the Columbian

Communist Party.

Note:

(bh) ALN, Aksenoy is no doubt iden

Alacnoy with whom, according to Epstein's book, (page 146)
x Marina Onwald bad an interview in 19G1. Aksenov Ia alse

mentioned in MeMillan's book (pages 132-133). Aknenoy

allegedly said to Marina, "Tell your hugbaud.not.ta worry. I

belicve your requ

twillthe peanted." Also see Page 125 of
the same book. :

73. Did you knew or know of Avkadiy Denisovich Rudak?
me

Note: Rudak was Deputy Chairman of the KGB during 1959 to 1960 and
might have taken part in the Oswald case while Oswald lived
in Minsk,

4. . Did you know or know of Major General Stepan Alekseyevich Smorodinskiy?

Note: Smorodinskiy was Deputy Chairman of the KGI for Relorussia in
~"* 1962 and most likely know about the Oswald case, His name
would most likely appear in the Oswald file.

/ 5+, Do you know Lt, General Vasiliy Ivanovich Petrov?

Petrov was KGB Chairman for Belorussia from 1959 to 1973,
Therefore, it would be his agency, the KGB, which would watch
Oswald in Minsk, It is safe to assume that after the assassination
of President Kennedy in 1963, Petrov, as Chairman of the KGB

of Belorussia, would review the Oswald file and end it to Moscow.
“He would algo have been called to Moscow KGB headquarters to

7 take part in the preparation of the spravka (summary) of the
Oswald file,

Note:

64 What do you know about Lt, General Aleksandr Ivanovich Perepelitsyn?

Note: Perepeliteyn was Chafrman of the KGB of the Belorussian Republic
from 1954 to 1959. “Nosénko sliould know him or -at Iéaat about him.”
Nosenko should be asked if ‘Perepelitsyn took any part in the
‘investigation of Oswald, (Perepelitsyn was Deputy Chairman of
the KGB of the USSR from 1959 to 1967. He died in Moscow.)

7. What part, if any, was played by General Sergey Grigoryevich Bannikov

in the Ouwald case, especially after the assassination of President Kennedy?

Bannikov was mentioned by Nosenko as one of the Deputy Chiefs of
the Second Chief Directorate and later on as one of the Deputy
Chairmen of the KGB of the USSR, From 1968 to 1978, Bannikov
was Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court,

Note:*

1. Can you explain why you went to England and Cuba under the name Nikolayev
and to Geneva using your true name, Nosenko? What would have happened

1 From where did you learn that the GRU was not informed about Oswald's
presence in the USSR? Wouldn't the GRU officer in Intourist, whom you

rentioned earlier, have known about Oswald's presence in the USSR?

Did you ever hear that Oswald possibly had contact with the Soviet

intelligence during his service in Japan? _

u stated previously that there was no information that Oswald offered

to give information on the US Marine Corps. You did not read the file,
Then how do you know this to be the case? How do you know that the KGB
and Gru made no attempt to debricf Oswald about his service in the
US Marine Corps?

, 3. Previously you mentioned one Colonel Voloshin as an officer of the

! Defense Ministry of the USSR. Can you provide any additional information

on this Voloshin? Could it be possible that he was a KGB officer instead
i of in the Defense’Ministry? :

Note: (a) According to Epstein's book, one Pavel T, Voloshin was an,
administrator -at Patrice Lumamba University and was a KGB
officer who accompanied a group of Russian dancers to Los Angeles
in 1959 at just about the same time that Oswald was making
weekend trips there. to get his passport and possibly to make other
arrangements for'his trip to Moscow. A few weeks after Oawald
decided to return to the United States, he received a letter from
Patrice Lumumba University Signed by Voloshin. (page 111)

(b) P.D, knew one KGB officer by the name of Voloshin (first
and middle name forgotten) who used to work in SMERSH
(military CI) and later in the late 1940's and beginning of the
1950's inS & T Department of the KGB,

Do you have any comments on Marina's statement when she said,
“Our government (Soviet) knows every move I make." She make this
comment shortly after her expulsion from the Komisomol.

Did you know that while in Minsk Marina belonged to a group of youths
who gathered together to listen to Voice of America and bec? Would
that be enough for the KGB to have Marina in its card files? Ie it
possible that Marina was the KGB agent reporting on them?

You stated that if Marina had been recruited by the KGB, you would
know about it and it would be in the file, But you did not read the file.
How then do you know that she was not recruited?

You said that amorg Marina's relatives there was an officer of the Minsk
Militia, a Lt, Colonel, Do you have any comments on Marina's
revelation that her real father was a traitor and that he was shot? If
her father was a traitor and he was shot, would hie name be in the KGB
card file? Would the name of Marina's mother be in the KGB card file
as the wife of a traitor? Ie it then possible that Marina's name also
would be in the KGB card file somewhere?

.

You stated previously that KGB had no interest in Marina prior to her
meeting Oswald and that the KGB investigated her only after Oswald
applied for permission to register marriage with Marina. How do you
know that? Did you read a special file on Marina? Marina revealed
lately that while she was living in Leningrad in 1958 or 1959, she met
a diplomat from Afghanistan who lured her to his hotel room and tried

to make love to her.- Do you think the KGB in Leningrad would know

about this diplomat and whom he lured to hid hotel? Is it possible that

the US? Did you have a rmation about the possibility that there was

another file in the KGB on Marina, a file for an agent or informer of the

KGB or MVD? If sucha file cxisted, it must be reflected in the Oswald

file, as well as in the surnmary which you-read,,
Did you hear or know that while in Leningrad Marina dated one Oleg
Tarussin, a student who had ambitions to enter the Soviet diplomatic

service and who had some trouble with the authorities over a minor

of the USSR? Did you know that Rimma Shirokova visited Oswald in

Minok?.. (See Epstein's book, page 124.)

Oswald and Shirokova allegedly talked about the possibility of

it? :

Note: In his previous interrogation, Nosenko hesitated in answering those

You stated previously that the KGB considered Oawald to have retained
his American citizenship while he was In the Soviet Union, Do you have
any pee on the fact that after his arrival in the USSR, and after

:nohip, he returned to the :

having made oral requests for Sovict citi

Do you think the KGB monitored Oswald's conversations with the
American Consulate officers or received reports from the American
Embassy (from Sovict employees there or Soviet agents there) about

Oswald's denunciation of US citizenship? Did the KGB instruct Oswald

to denounce hls American citizenship at the American Embassy before
he would be permitted to apply for Soviet citizenship?

You stated that the, decision to give Oswald a stipend: was mado by the
Red Cross. Explain in detail how the Red Cross learned that Oswald
arrived in the USSR, Who informed the Red Cross that there was an
American who needed help? Why was it decided to give help from the
Red Cross and not from the Trade Union? It is.understandable that
Oswald might not have had enough money to start a new life in the USSR,
but he was not a poor beggar who needed to be turned to the Red Cross

instead of the Trade Union. -How did you find out that it was the Red Cross

that made the decision? According to available information, the Red

Cross does not assign money to anybody without the recommendation of

If it was decided by the KGE officers and by Soviet doctors that Oswald was

abnormal, then why wae he perruitted to marry a Soviet-citizen?

Note: According to Soviet law, in every union republic, including
Belorussia, the "marriage cannot he permitted between persons
if one of them is prosunced a mental case or imbecile,"
Did you have any information that the Minsk KGB reported to Mescow
headquarters Oswald's intention to marry a Soviet citizen, in this case,
Marina?
You stated previously that Oswald's file wae sent to the Second Directorate
of the Relorussian KGB, Hew do you know that it was sent specifically
to the Second Directorate and not to the KGB chairman or his deputy
with a special instruction?
What do you mean "to keep an eye on him" (Oswald)? That, according
to your words, was the instraction from the Seventh Department of thé
Second Chief Directorate to the Belorussian Second Directorate of the KGB,
You stated’ that there was no visible surveillance of Oswald, there wad no

that there were agents around Oswald in places where ho worked and lived;
Explain. how you learned about it, Do you know tha names of any
agents who reported on Oswald? If you did not read the file on Oswald,
how could you know about it?

Previously ‘you stated that Oswald was handled no differently than any

other American defector, «+ The only difference was that he was not

to be allowed to stay, and he was considered to be abnormal." If this was
the only difference, and it is quite a big one, then why was he allowed to
stay in the USSR? If Oswald was “not normal" according to the KGB

officers, then this should ke noted in the Oswald file which was sent to

two months,

Do you have any comments on the statement made by Marina's uncle,
the MVD colonel: “I thought that Alik (Oswald) had not only given up :

his American citizenship but had become a citizen of the USSR,"

The question is that if an MVD colonel thought or could be fooled
by the KGB that Oswald was a Sovict citizen, it is possible that
he really was a citizen or that the KGB spread the rumor that he

was,

time, and because the file was taken away te the higher authorities of

the Second Chicf Directorate and to the KGR chairman, you had no chance

NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich, a Soviet
KGB officer who defected -in 1964 and
Ww subsequently involuntarily con-
fined in the U.S. hy the Agency for
a period of approximately three years.

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-
sonnel in SwitzerJand in June 1962
and subsequently defected in January

1964. NOSENKO brought to the WS,

and after a period of relative freedom

he was involuntarily confined in

April 1964, From April 1964: to

August 1965, he was confined at an
Agency controlled site-in Clinton,
Maryland. From August 1965: to

October 1967, NOSENKO was ‘confined

at +» In October
1967, We was returned to the Washington
area, given incre, ng amounts of
freedom until he was given total free-
dom in April 1969. NOSENKO bee:
U.S. citizen in April 1974, NOSE!

was employcd by the Agency as a
consultant in March 1969 and continucs
under contract to date. flis present
salary is $23,500 per year. .

KO.

(1) The legal basis to confine NOS!
against his will was discussed by
Mr. Richard Helms, Db/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1), On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).

(2) There are a serics of letters from
the DDCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Nepartment of
Justice and the white louse, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's confine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 @ 5).


RESULTS :

TERMINATION :

COMMENTS +

By memorandua dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the BBCI summarizing
the results of the SOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI.
Roth reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challeng: the above two reports.

continues under contract to
cy. He is brought to shington
ally to consult on matters

to his background and experience.
reports are available in the

f the Office of Sccurity which
detail financial aspects of this case.
No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not
document the rationale for his continued
confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated § August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO
was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
buring this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

MEMORANDUN FOR RECORD

‘SUBJECT: Discussion with Deputy Attorney
General on Nosenko Case

1, Mr Helas, Nr. Houston and Mr. Murphy set with
the Deputy Attorney Goneral and weabers of his staff to
discuss subject case. Present froa Mr. Katzenbach's

staff were Messrs. Foley, Yeagley and Reis. =
2.. Mr. Holos explained the Nosanko case briefly

and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what

we at least considered to be two probleas on which we
would like the advice of the Departaent of Justice.
First, wo would secon feel coapalled to begin hostile
interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth
with respect to his mission for the KC3 and wo wondsred
what the legal position would bo in circumstances in

: which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-

pose. Second, wo would have to be ready after deterain~-
ing that we could obtain no additional inforuation fros
Nosenko to doport hin... We had thought of taking hin to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Borlin
where this has been done a number of tincs in the past.

He 3. There was soso discussion of whether deportation:

to another country sight be a consideration. Nr. Helms
explained we would probably face publicity probleas in
deporting to a third country of the kind we would en=
counter if he wera free in the U. S. Nr. Hels noted
there were many itoms of inforsation which we and the

FBI realize are of no significance because of the file
holdingsswe have but which an unscrupulous newspaper san
could use to creste sischief, This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus that 3erlin was probably the best

place.

4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foley to the coaditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. We is hers as an “ox-
clusion and parole case” which seans he has not been
adaitted and has been paroled to the Azsacy which is
responsible for hin while ho is in this country. This

ey



parole can be interproted to moan parole to a specific
locale which would provide sone justification for our
detaining hiz for questioning. It was then pointed out,
however, that if he said he wished to leave the country
to return to. the. Soviet Union, technically we would not
be able to detain hio further. In this event, wa would
be faced with the need to deport his quickly and quietly
and for this purpose. the isnigration warrant of arrest
and deportation was probably the best instrunent.

5. Ur. Katzonbach asked Hr. Foley to check into
this and Mr. Foley will in turn contact Nr. Houston,
Mr, Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA
Office of Security officials to got the background of
their Lisison with the INS oa theso matters,

6. Mr. Helus thanked Mr, atzenbach for his assistance
and wo departed amid some jovial banter with respect to
"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" about what we expacted
to happen to him when he started to climb aver that “wall”

_in Berlin. eee

MEMORANDUM FOR: : Director of Security

SUBJECT: Parole Status of Defectors

1, On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department
of Justice om the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred
upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency. ©
kk was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible

for taking any action necessary to carry out the terms of the parole,

|” 2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the
Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. After setting up
Conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:

“After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume *

Fesponsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it
believes cor nt with the internal Security needs of the United States”
during continuance of their parole status." This means that the
Fesponsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary
+ to protect the internal security needs of the United States, The word

“minimum" is not necessarily a limitation, It merely means that good

‘ Judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.

.

3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the
parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the Unitad States or if
internal security reasons 90 require, the alien will be removed from
this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such
case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

Subjects’. : oie

(1) Subject will receive a regular ‘diet with modeat regulated.
portions, He is to have no dessert or "trimmings;

but may have the necessary silverware with which to” * .
eat properly, (CAUTION--Extreme care should be
exercised with regard to controlling the silverware,
and it was suggested that’at-least two of the guards
be required to count the silverware in and out; that
the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner
where it could be observed before the guards enter

the room, etc.)

(2) Arrangements are to be made for the installation of
adequate air-conditioning equipment to insure that a
comfortable temperature is maintained. (It is under-
stood that there is quite a bit of equipment available
through Logistics channels.)

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject, This should -

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisei

as to their responsibilities in this matter,

Question #3 - Did McCone or Raborn have any information on this:

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SE Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until late
October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the
Office of Sccurity by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was
at leust generally aware of the confinement of Nosenko and the
conditions of confinement, but any definite statement must be

based on SE records.

Question #4 - Where is Nosenko working now?

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at his personally owned
residence in North Carolina, He is engaged in research and
analytical work bascd on his previous knowledge of the KGB
and other Soviet matters. He is in the Washington, D. C. arca
for several days approximately every six wecks for direct
interviews by the FBI.and Office of Security personnel.

Question #5 - Is he working for CIA?

Answer:

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a full-time
contractual basis since 1 March 1969. The original contract
has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration,
primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. ...1n/late, -
197%, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for sala y

While one can criticize the fact that Nosenko was kept
incommunicado for approximately three years, and therefore
presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document
docs indicate, we believe, that the Agency was on the horns
of a dilemna in this regard. There were Icgitimate doubts
about, Nosenko's bona fides and concern that he was a Soviet
plant. There. was no country to which he could be deported
save the Soviet Union, and Nosenko himself refused to return
there. ‘Yet, in the United States, save when isolated from
society, he was considered to be a continuing threat -to
national security.

the Agency acted in a fully responsible manner to ensure that

Because of mounting pressure ‘from the press, which included
much speculation that Nosenko was a high level scientist or
disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department
would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's _
request for asylum in. the U.S. and identifying him as a
member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-
ruary, the Soviet Government delivered a note to. the American
Embassy in Moscow asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and
requesting an inmediate interview with him and his release.
On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-
ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he
accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in
locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected
these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-
mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko.."~
to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of
his own free will. -

out for evening and week-end excursions, Nosenko was at all
times accompanied by 0/S personnel. In addition, he took...
two-week vacation to Hawaii, again accompanied by case offi-

he was a KGB plant, and at the same time it became obvious
that it would be impossible to proceed further, to resolve

the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen
without changing the conditions in which he was being held.
Nosenko was growing’ increasingly uncooperative, especially

when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed

for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the i

of an alien registration card. At the same time, Nosenko's

heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing

increasing difficulties to the security personnel charged With
keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in

that it was only a matter of time before he created a public

scandal. More importantly, he was in a position to communi~

decided, therefore, that the physical circumstances of Nosenko's
stay in this country would have to be drastically changed if
the Agency were to carry out its counterintelligence responsi-
bilities and adhere to the terms of the parole agreement. As
a result, he was moved to quarters where his movements could

be more casily controlled, and his outing privileges were
suspended pending resolution of bona fides.

It is worth noting that had we not taken the above action
hut accepted Nosenko at face value, it is quite possible that
we would have proceeded with a series af operational actions
on the basis of his information, The results of some of these
actions could have been very embarrassing to the U.S. Govérnnent
politically and damaging to U.S. national security. For exam-
ple, his chief operational proposal at the time, and one that
he was most insistent that we should proceed with immediately,

involved the compromise of a very senior Soviet official.

SEGEET

The Seer y of State, Ambassador Thompson, and other

senior officials in, the Department of State were inforned of

our reservations about Nosenko's bona fides and our fears that

he might be a dispatched KGB agent. In discussions about the
possibility of Nosenko's eventual deportation, the Secretary
of State expressed serious concern about the adverse reaction:
that such a move might have on other potential defectors.

The Director of Security, State Department, was informed

of the bona fides problem at an-ecarly date. We have worked

closely with this office since then on the problem of eval-
uating the significance of Nosenko's information as it affects
the security interests of the State Department.

Because so much of Nosenko's information affected U.S.
internal sccurity matters for which the FBI bears primary

responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko was

a GB plant had a direct bearing on the validity of certain
FZ operations, the FBI was kept fully informed on our views
about Nosenko's hona fides and our progress in interrogating
and investigating him from the moment of his defection, The
FEI liaison officer was told of our reservations on Nosenko's
bona fides as early as $ February 1964. The Director of the

Nosewso’s case on 1 April 1964, the FRI interposed no objec-

commesce hostile interrogation. Subscquently, the FBI for- |

extent that "On considering carefully the results of your

SECHET

to have the time to analyze and resolve this case, and to
plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it was essential
that we attempt to keep the KGB from learning of our awareness
of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and
the implications thercof, was restricted tv a very few people
in the Agency and the. intelligence community. Nonethcless,

we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-
ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the, Soviets
were making a serious effort to find out what happened to
Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the French magazine <=,
Paris Match with an offer'to provide photographs and materials

for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family, According

to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach to an
international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain
compensation from Nosenko for damages caused by his abandon-
ment of her and her children. In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be fron Nosenko himself,

il

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approuch to repre-
sent blatant and cruel manipulation of his family by the KGB

and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing

to an interview or in any other way.

Nosenko's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions
of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act. Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by
the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed
by the Attorney General and the [E71 on 10 February 1955,
which states:

“After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supervison and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal
security needs of the United States during con-
tinuance of their parole sta'tus.”
In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and
because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious
and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we
ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

SECRET



SECRET

States. From 12 February to 4 April 1964 it was possible to
keep Nosenko at a location where he could enjoy a certain
amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.
After 4 April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was
necessary to keep him incommunicado at.a location which is
known to no one outside of the Agency (and to very few within
it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country

Although his freedom of movement had been severely
restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-
plaint about his treatment. On the contrary, we had several
written statements from him in which he stated that our
handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country’
we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation
as a contingency measure. In carly 1964, we thought that-it. eee
might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda
drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko
has confessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time,

however, and in view of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission and our Clearer understanding of what

13 : ee

SECRET



SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems
stood in the way of his deportation to cither the USSR or a
third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous
occasions that he will never contemplate return to the USSR,
and, although we suspect that he might secretly welcome such
a move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end
with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,
etc. When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with
Department of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of
State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for
the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-
tors. Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against
long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse

violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United

States. Under these circumstances an alleged "confession"
by Noscnko would have come under very close scrutiny, and
might have backfired very badly. Another point that had to
be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again
playing their part, might have refused to accept Noscnko on
the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.
Third Country: Although we believed’ it likely that

Nosenko would accede to deportation to a third country,

14

SECKET

there is certainly no country in the free world on which we
could conceivably have unloaded Nosenko without first inform-

NOSENKO was confined when as @ result of his debricfing

NOSENKO's initial entry into the U.S, was coordinated wht.
the Department of State, and they were periodically advised
of his status during his confinement up to the time of his

final settlement.

The strict conditions of NOSENKO's confinement were
intended to convey to him the seriousness of his position
as a suspected disinformation agent and to make clear to him that
his free settlement in the U.S, was precluded as long as
this issue was unresolved, It was understood, however,
that at any time he could have lected to end his cenfine-
ment and return to the Soviet Union. OS files do not document.
that this latter condition was explicitly conveyed to
NOSENKO, however, it is the recollection of senior staff —
officers (ADD/O and p/OS) that such was the case, and further
that it was a condition routinely applied to other defectors
whose bona fides were in doubt.

1. Forwarded herewith is a 31 December 1974 memorandum
from the Acting Director of Security on subject activities. The
material represents responses to questions posed by your office.
Obviously, the next phase of the investigation will require more
detailed reviews of each activity.

a 2. Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON :

We should spell out what is meant by the ~
statement that the FBI "deferred further coveragé
to the Office of Security, " how it was expreased and
what form it took.

The taping of two conversations does not seem
to constitute “electronic surveillance" in the usual
sense, It certainly is not trespatory surveillance.

A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted.

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI
knowledge, and report such information as we get.

AELADLE .

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry.

surveillance, including possible higher approval.

newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

We may want actual copies of newspaper,
stories for display, in addition to memos, should
DCI wish to use it.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

ATTENTION Mr, Neil Ainsiic
VIA : Deputy Director for Administration
SUBJECT : Alleged legal Activities

(Unidentified Subject--Alleged Abuse
of Defector)

1. Reference is made to Mr. Ainslie's verbal request
for a review of Office of Security files in an effort to
Provide information pertinent to a case mentioned on page
170 of the Report to the President by the Commission on CIA
activities within the United States.

2, The case in question from Page 170 of the Commission
Report is quoted as follows: "In one other case, a defector
was physically abused, although not seriously injured. The
Director of Central Intelligence discharged the employee in-

volved." 7

3. A search of Office of Security file resources has
reflected -information Pertinent to a case in which a defector
was physically abused at an overseas location, and the Agency
employee was later terminated by the DCI, It is not known
whether the following case is identical to the referenced
case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts
appear to be quite similar,

4. Information developed by this Office of possible in-

terest to the Inspector General, pertains to one John Torpats,
an ex-CIA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

S$. Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a
pyiuralized U.S. citizen in 1926, Torpats was employed by
CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. The
file information reflected that in July 19S6, Torpats was found
guilty of mistreatment of an alien by a Special Inquiry Board

CL BY 011018

SECRET tr SLyee


in Frankfurt, West Germany. The alien involved was Eduard
Oun, an Estonian who defected from Estonia through Sweden
in 1955.

6. The incident in Frankfurt involved mistreatment of
Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats. The charges
of physical abuse included the striking of Oun with the fist;
application of turpentine and ointments to various parts of
the body, the scrubbing of Oun's body with a brush, and forc-
ing Oun to stand in the nude as Jong as eight days during
interrogations with only very bricf rest periods,

7. Torpats was returned to Headquarters and was brought
before an Employment Review Board for consideration of separa-
tion from the Agency. The Board's recommendations initially
were that Torpats be "transferred to an area outside the
Clandestine Services. Torpats appealed the decision, and a
later recommendation included reduction in grade from GS-14
to GS-13, Torpats later received uns. tisfactory fitness re-
Ports and engeged in various "in house" battles with Agency
officials concerning his employment.

8. Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the
authority granted the DCI under Section 102(C) of the National
Security Act of 1947, as ammended, effective 30 January 1961.
Later in 1961, Torpats filed suit against the DCI contesting
his dismissal, and the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia granted the government's motion for summary judgment
against Torpats. Torpats appealed the decision, and the U.S.
Court of Appeals, in 1962, upheld the lower court's ruling
that Torpats' termination was legal.

9. The Office of Security file of Eduard Oun contained
little information other than interrogation reports dated 1956,
It was not clear from file information whether Oun entered the
United States after the Frankfurt incident. The most recent
document contained in the Oun file was dated 17 September
1956 and noted that Oun had been psychiatrically examined and
found qualified for Agency sponsored immigration to the U.S,
under Public Law 203.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rockefeller Commission Contact

Mason Cargill told me today that the xeference
in the Commission report to an employee who was fired
because he abused a defector came from a deposition by aeiasisee
Dick Helms. Helms could not remember an exact name,
but from the description which he gave on his deposition, 7
it is clear that the employee who was fired was John
Torpats. He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960.

Torpats, himself a Lithuanian “tefncee. was working
Germany,

in the/ \
In the’ Course Of interrogating another Lithuanian

defector, Torpats beat him. After Torpats was fired,
he sued the Director (then McCone). He lost the case.
