IDENTIFICATION:

BACKGROUND

NOSENKO, Yurily Ivanovich,

a Soviet

KGB officer who defoeted in

190d and

wis subscruently involuntarily con-

fined

in the U.s

• by the Agency for

a period of approximately three years.

NOSENKO first contacted Agency per-

sonnel in Switzerland in June 1962

and subsequently defected in January

NOSINKO was brought to the l1.5.

and after a period of relative freedom.

he was involuntarily confined in

April 1964.

From April 1964 to

August 1965, he was confined at an

Agency controlled site in Clinton,

Maryland.

From August 1065 to

October 1967. NOSENKO was confined

J.. In October

190r, ne was returned to the washington

area, given increasing amounts of

freedom until he wis given total free-

dom in April 1969.

NOSENKO became a

U.S. citizon in April 1974. NOSESKO

was. employed by the Agency. as a

consultant in March 1969 and continues

under contract to date.

His present

salary is $23,500 per year.

(1) The legal basis to confine NOSESKO

against his will was discussed by

Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others sith

the Deputy Attorney (eneral on 2 April

1964 (Tab 1) •

On 3 April 1964, the

Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence

Houston, advised the Director of Security

RESULTS

TERMINATION

COMMENTS

By memoranden

dated 2 October 1908,

the Director of Security forbarded

two reports to the DUCt summarizing

the results of the NOSiNo case to

that date.

The reports are voluminous.

One was prepared by the Office of

scourity and the other by the FBl.

Both reports conclude that NOSENKO

was a bona fide defector.

A draft

memorandum attached to this file.

dated 21 October 1968 and prepared

by the Cl Staff, raises question

regarding NOSENKO's bona fides

and challenges the shove two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency.

He is brought to Washington

periodically to consult on matters

germane to his background and experience.

Various reports are available in the

files of the Office of Scourity which

detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since

the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original

document the rationale

confinement of NOSENKO, cor his continued

confinement over so long a period of time.

A memorandum dated 5 August 1909 states

that various congressional staff officers

were briefed on NOSENKO and states that

oncern for his safety, as well as con•

corn regarding his bona fides, promptec

the prolonged confinement.

(See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Sccurity files document

a period in 1969 during which a mail

cover was placed on NOSENKO.

3) During the above period, NOSENKO

Wils

allowed a pleasure trip

to Florida.

During this trip, Agency personnel, with

apparent Headquarters approval, obtained

the services of prostitutes.

This

apparently occurred on at least two

occasions.

2. Mr. lolas explained tha josanto case briefly

and indicated

that shortly te would be faced with what

at lease considored to be two problens on which ve

would like the advico of the Deparcent of Justico®

First, wo would sooon

feel cospelled to begin hostllo

interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive a? the truch

with respect to his mission for the KGB and ve wonderod

what the legal position would be in circuistances in

which we datained Nosenko against his will for this pur

Second, we would

have to be ready after detorain-

ing that we

could obtaln no additional inforantion from

Nosenko to deport hiu.. Me had thought of caking bia to

Germany and transferring his so Soriat custody in Borlin

where this has been done a number of times in the past.

3.

There was soso discussion of whether deportation

to another country night be a consideration.

Ni. Heing

explained no would probably face publicity problems in

deporting to a thiru country of the kind ve would en-

counter 'if ho were froo in the U. S. Nr. Bélas noted

there vero many itous of Inforsacion which me and the

FBI realizo aro of no significance because of the file

holdings-re have but which an unscrupulous neuspapor san

could use so creato nischief.

Thig aspect was then dropped

and it was the consensus chat serlin was probably the best

place.

4. The question of the basis for detention was again

raised and relared by ur. Foloy so the coalitiong under

which Nosenko is in this country. He is horo as an "ox-

•suslon and parole case" which seans he bas not boer

suntered and has been paroled to che droner which le

detaining hin for questioning.

It was then pointed out,

however, that if be said ho wished to leave the country

to raturn to the Soviet Union, tochnically we would not

be

ablo to detain hin further.

In this event, ve would

bo faced with the need so deport his quickly and quietly

3 April 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Director of Security

SUBJECT:

Parole Status of Dofectors

1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department

of Justice or the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS ia deferred

upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this Agency.

Is was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible

for taking any action necessary to carry out the torms of the parole.

•Z. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. Altur setting up

conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement atates:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume

responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it

believes consistent with the internal security needs of the United States

during continuance of their parole status." This means that the

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary

to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word

"minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good

judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.

3.

The agreement further provides that upon completion of the

parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if

internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from

this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such

case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

departure.

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject. This should

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors

and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed

as to their responsibilities in this matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

The Inspector General

SUBJECT

: The Nosenko Case

Attached please find a summary of a document written in

1967 to the General Counsel outlining, the Nosenko case and

explaining to him actions

which had boon taken with regard to

Nosenko.

As noted in the first paragraph, in October 1967

Nosenko

took up residence in the washington arca and was

advised that, should he wish to leave the apartment for any

location whatsoever,

he was free to so do.

In other words,

that date, Nosenko was essentially a

totally frce man.

That he chose not to

flce in any

way may be indicative of his

attitude toward the manner in which

he was handled prior to

October 1967.

While one can criticize the fact that Nosenko was kept

incommunicado for approximately three years, and therefore

presumably denied full

civil rights, the attached document

docs

indicate, we helieve,

Agency was

of a dilemna

in this recard.

There were legitimate doubts

about. Nosenko's bona fides and concern that he was a Soviet

plant.

There was

no country. to which he could he deported

save

the Soviet Union,

Nosenko himself

refused to return

there. Yet, in the

society, he was considered

national security.

conduct.

There were at the time very

legitimate reasons to

belicve

that full and toril

rolcase

of Nosenko would be an

abrogation by the Agency of its legal responsibility. To

garnsay that decision in

retrospect is, we bolice, an error.

In sum, the sit of detection places the defector at the mercy

of the laws of the country to which he defects.

It is the

obligation of the accopping country to see to it that tho

laws are followed.

In the Nosenko casc, it sechs to us that

the Agency aeged in a fully responsible manner to ensure that

its responsibility for the defector was met.

While it was

unfortunate that it took so long to resolve the matter, we

can find no fault with the fact

that the Agency

met its

responsihility to both the United States and to Nosenko

himself.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Yurly Ivanovich NOSENKO

In early or mid-1967, the Agency General. Counsel was

provided a summary of the Nosenko case.

The negorandum

sought an advisory opinion from the General Counsel on the

Agency's legal basis for its handling of losenko through

that date and on the legal aspects on the eventual disposi-

tion of Nosenko. Shortly subsequent to this senorandum to

the General Counsel, Nosenko took

up residence in October 1967

in an apartment in the Washington area and was reminded that

should he wish, he could travel freely anywhere at anytime.

He gradually created

a new life for himself in the United

States and has indicated on several occasions that he holds

no ill feeling about his handling by the Agency at anytime.

Background

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with CIA repre-

sentatives in Geneva in 1962. He identified hinself as a

staff officer of the KGB's internal security directorate and

offered to sell counterintelligence information. This offer

was

accepted and he was recruited

debriefed

on counterintelligence matters during five meetings

in Geneva. He then returned to the USSR. He came to Geneva

again in January 1964 as the security officer for the Soviet

disarmament delegation. After i number of mectings with his

CIA handlers he defected on 4 February 1964 and was secretly

taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border

on the night of 1/5 February with

alias U.S. Army identity

documents. In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,

Nosenko wrote out®

an asylum request, requesting political

asylum

from the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides had

arisen on the basis of the information he had provided both

in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-

inally planned to do a detailed bona fides debriefing and

assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving

Nosenko

to the United States. However, unprecedented action

by the Soviet. Government in respect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the

press that

Nosenko, described as an "expert attached to the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected.

SECRET

## Page 50

SECRET

Because of mounting

pressure from the press, which

included

much speculation that Nosenko was a high level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided

that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's

request for asylum in the U.S. and identifying him'as a

member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-

ruary, the Soviet Government delivered a note to the American

Embassy in Moscow

asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and

requesting an immediate interview with him and his release.

On 12 February, Soviet Anbassador to the Disarmament Confer-

ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he

accused-the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in

locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected

these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-

mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko

to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of

his own free will.

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,

Nosenko was brought to the United States.

He travelled by

commercial air, again using alias

_identification,:

and was admitted to the country..at New York City (in true

name) on parole under the provisions of Section

212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

On 14. February, in

Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GRUMYKO called in Ambassador

KOHLER and protestéd "impermissable activities" on the part

of the U.S: in Nosenko's case.

Soviet press

spokesmen took

an even harder line to lestern correspondents, and accused

the U.S. of kidnapping Nosenko. On the afternoon of 14 Sep-

tember, at two separate interviers, he spoke first to Swiss

Embassy and then to Soviet Embassy representatives. . At

these interviews, which were also attended by State Department

and INS officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland

of his own free will to seek asylum in the U.S. In addition,

he replied

to questions of the Sovict Embassy representative

to the effect that he was renouncing his soviet citizenship.

On the evening of 14 february, the. U.S. State Department made

a brief formal reply to the Soviet protest, then issued a

brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had

been held and that Nosenko had confirmed his desire to remain

in this country.

From the time of his arrival to & April 1961, Nosenko

Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially

investigations. We concluded that it had been established

beyond

reasonable doubt that Nosenko was a liB agent who.

established contact with CIA, subsequently defected on KGB

instructions, and that he came to the United States on a

deception mission.

The implications of this mission had a

grave and direct

bearing on U.S. national security. Although

our findings were

supported by the resules of too polygraph

cxaminations, the nature of the cvidence was inadmissable in

a court of law. In any case, it is cicar that Nosenko had

not been in a position to perform any overt act of transgres-

sion of U.S, espionage laws since 4 April 1964 wheh he was

placed in a restricted area and deprived of any conceivable

means of communication with the KGB.

Nosenko did not admit that he defected on KGB orders

or that he came to the U.S. on & KGB mission. He has admitted,

however, that he made numerous lies about his personal history

and about the details of his KGB service to U.S. officials,

both before and after

arriving in the United States.

Secrotary of State, the Attorney General, the Special Assis-

tant to the President on National Security Affairs, McGeorge

Agency and the FBI. were

all notified immediately. On s Febru-

ary 1901, General Carter reported the defection to an executive

session of Usib and followed this up with formal statements to

USIB members on 11 and 19 Fobruary 1964, which stated that

Nosenio's bona fides had not yet been established. It was

agrecd that no DS number would he issued to josenko, and that

he would be handled on a special basis by this Agency. In

fact, normal USIB interest in Nosenko as a defcetor dropped

off drascically as

it became quickly apparent that he had no

positive intelligence interest of value to any part of the

community.

The President was informed of the full extent of our

suspicions about Nosenko's bona fides by the then Director,

closely with this office since then on the problem of eval-

uating the significance of Nosenko's information as it affects

the security interests of the State Department.

Because so much of Nosenko's information affected u.s.

internal security matters for which the FBI bears primary

responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko was

a KGB plant had a direct bearing

the validity of cortain

FBI operations, the FBI was kept fully informed on our views

about Nosenko's bona fides and our progress in interrogating

and investigating him from

the moment of his defection.. The

FBI liaison officer was

told of our reservations on losenko's

bona fides as carly as 5 February 1964. The Director of the

FBI and his deputy for Internal

Security, Millian Sullivan,

subsequently. the FBI for-,

our findings on Nosenko, at lease to the

extent that "On considering carefully the results of your

interrogations of luriy Nosenko and your anälysis of his

possible that

Nosenko could be a Soviet plant or agent pro-

vocateur."

(and several members of his

staff) were apprised of our res-

ervations

about Nosenko on 2

to have the time to analyze and resolve this case, and to

plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it was essential

that we attempt to keep the NGB fron learning of our

anarchess

of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenio,

and

the implications thercof, was restricted to a very few people

in the Agency and the intelligence community.

Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons and principals in the intel-

ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of leakage.

Sovier Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the Soviets

were making a serious effort

to find out what happened to

Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy MOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the Frerch

magazine

Paris Match with an offer

8o provide photographs

and matcrials

for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family. According

to Korolev, Nosenko's wifc was considering an approach

to an

international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain

compensation from Nosenko for damages caused by his abandon-

ment of her and her chiluren.!

In responding to this approach

se quoted a statement, purporting to be fron Nosento himself,

11

## Page 59

these

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach

to repre-

sent blatant and cruel manipulation of his family by the KGB.

and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing

to an interview or in any other way.

Nosenko's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions

of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality

Act.. Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by

the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed

by the Attorney General and the ECl on 10 February 1955,

which states:

"After

parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supervison and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal

security needs of the United

States during con-

tinuance of their parole status."

In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and

because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious

and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we.

ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

States. From

12 February to a April 1004 it was possible to

keep

Nosenio at a location where he could enjoy a certain

amount of novement and of

contact with the outside world.

After & April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was

necessary to keep him incommunicado at a location which is

known to no one outside of the agency land to very fow within

it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country

undor the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically

extended bo the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his freedon of movement had been severely

restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-

plaint about his treatment. On the contrary, we had soveral

written statements from him in which he stated that our

handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation

as a contingency measure. In carly 1964, we thought that it

might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda

drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko

has confessed his true KGB role.

With the passage of tame,

however, and in view of

our much firmer

conclusions about his

real role and mission

and our clearer understanding of what

13

SECRET

---

## Page 61

SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems

stood in the way of his deportation to either the USSR or a

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous

occasions

that. he will never contemplate return to the USSR,

and, although we suspect that he might secretly welcome such

is move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end

with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,

etc.

when the possibility of expulsion was discussed with

Departnent of State officials in 1964, both tho Secretary of

State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for

the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-

tors.

Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against

long established U.s. policy, and would be cortnin to arouse

violent reaction

from

ethnic minority groups in the United

States.

Under these circumstances an alleged "confession"

by Nosenko would have come under very close scrutiny, and

might have backfired very badly. Another point that had to

be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again

playing their part, might have refused

to accope Nosenko on

the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.

Third Country: Although we believed it likely that

Nosenko would accede to deportation to a third country.

thore is cortuinly no country in the free world

on which we

could

conceivably have unloaded Nosenko without first inform

desirable objective, it seemed certain that the Department

of State would veto such à piece of intergovernmental duplic-

hey on the basis of the-politienrisks involved.*

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel

SUBJECT

: Office of Security reports on PARAGON,

NOSENKO, AELADLE, | CELOTEX I and 11

and MOCKINGBIRD

Forwarded herewith is a 31 December 1974 memorandum

from the Acting. Director of Security on subject activities. The

material represents responses lo questions posed by your office.

Obviously, the next phase of the investigation will require more

detailed reviews of each activity.

2. Questions that occur to us in reading the attached, are:

PARAGON

We should spell out what is meant by the

statement that the FBI "deferred further coveragé

to the Office of Security," how it was expressed and

what form it took.

The taping of two conversations does not seem

to constitute "electronic surveillance" in the usual

sense. It certainly is not trespatory surveillance.

A little more detail on the equipment will be wanted.

NOSENKO

We will go to the DDO for any record of DCI

knowledge, and report such information as we get.

AELADLE

We will want to verify DDCI's approval of entry.

.... L.3110)

---

## Page 68

CELOTEX !

We will want more detail on the actual

surveillance, including possible higher approval.

This is responsive to the DCI's request for

newspaper articles that led to the surveillance.

CELOTEX II

Questiona similar to CELOTEX I.

We may want actual copies of newspaper

stories for display, in addition to memos, should

DCl. wish to use it..

#MOCKING BIRD:

No recorded (in CIA) formal approval by

Attorney General. It may be that Justice will

have a copy.

Does this raise a question of surveillance

of congressmen if one is contacted by someone

1.

Reference

for a

is made to Mr. Ainslie's vorbal request

revicw of Office of Security files in

effort to

provide information pertinent to a case mentioned

on page

170 of the Report to the President by the Commission on CIA

activitics within the United States.

2.

The case in question

from page 170 of the Commission

Report

is quoted as

follows:

"In one other case, a defector

was physically abüsed, although not seriously injured.

Director-of-Contral=Intolligencerdischarged the-employee in

volved.

3.

A search of Office of Security file resources has

roflected information pertinent to i

case in which a defector

was-physically- abused-at an overscas location, and the Agency

employee was later. terminated by the bet.

It is not known

whether the following case is identical to the referenced

case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts

appear to be quite similar.

Information developed by this Office of possible in-

terest to the Inspector Concral, pertains to one

John Torpats,

an ex-CIA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

5.

• Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a

naturalized U.S. citizen

in 1926.

Torpats was employed by

CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. • The

ile information reflected that in July 1956

Torpats was found

in Frankfurt, West Germany.

The alien involved was Eduard

an Estonian who defected

from Estonia through Sweden

The incident in Frankfurt involved sistreatment of

Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats.

Ine charges

of physical abuse included the striking of bun with the fist:

application of turpentine and ointments to various parts of

interrogations with only very brief rest periods.

7.

Torpats was returned to leadyuarters and was brought

before

an Employment Review Board for consideration of separa-

The Boardis recommendations

were that forpats cetransferred on area ouestde the ye

Clandestine Services."

Torpats appealed the decision,

later recommendation included reduction in grade from GS-14

to GS-13.

Torpats later reccived unsatisfactory fitness re-

ports

and engoged in various "in house" battles with Agency

officials concerning his employment.

8.

Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the

authority granted the DCI under Section 102(C) of the National

Sccurity Act of 1947, as ammended, effective 30 January 1961.

Later in 10 torpats liled suit against -the-DelcontestingF

his dismissal and the-U.S. Distriot Court for the District of

Columbia granted the government's motion for summary judgment

against Torpats. Torpats appealed the decision,

and the U.s.

Court of Appeals, in 1962, upheld the lower court's ruling

that Torpats!

- termination was.legal.....

9. The Office of Security file of Eduard Oun contained

little

information other than

interrogation reports dated 1956.

It was

not clear from

file information whether Oun entered the

United

States after the Frankfurt incident.

The most recent

document contained in the Oun file was dated 17 September

1956 and noted that Oun had been psychiatrically examined and

found

qualified

for Agency sponsored immigration to the u.s.

. 3. You stated previously that in January 1960 you were processed to go to the

US with the Soviet Automotive Delegation. You obtained a passport in your

true narie, Nosenko, bat the date was postponed, then cancelled. Who

selected your candidacy for the trip?

What were you supposed to do in

the USA? Why was the trip postponed? Why were you processed in your

true name, Nosenko, and not under the name Nikolayev, under which you

visitor fired.ondee

Ammering this question lie mentioned thie recrustment of ten

Americans

decided you go,

that I must be hero (in Genevi), I sale, "Be my

docided "You will go. That's all" (Nosenko knocked on the desk)...

Well, what am I?.... Who have I recruitted?. • . Ten Americans,

no more than that... (and Gribanov said) "You will go! You must go!"

III. Sovict vinas and other regulations for tourists traveling to the USSR

1. 1. Didn't you know or remember how. Oswald's visa was processed and

from what country Oswald entered the USSR? la it ponsible that he

entered the USSR on a "podvisnaya" visa?

V2. You previously said that you saw Oswald's visa application, but you could

not say from what country Oswald came to the USSR. In your opinion, is

it possible that Oswald received his visa application in some other European

country, then went to Finland and through Finland entered the USSR without

contacting the Soviet consulate in Helsinki? Did

you hear any talk about the

possibility that is described above? I su, when did you hear it and from

whom?

V 3. On 3 July 1961 you siaied that you have seen Oswald's ankera (visa

application). Do you remember what was in that anketa? Did you read

the anketa? What did you mean that you saw the anketa? Was it in the

naine Lee Harvey Osuals, or was there another name? Did you see the

name of the person who signed the anketa?

Ao lore your disor any information des the effred thear Ossold might not have

come: 10 the 50al conoulate or to the Soviet Enharay in Helsinki lo

slain his visio! Could he hive ghtined is vine in Switserlaud.ur. Sweden

sis: ns mave corne les didnindi and, without reporting lo the Soviet commulate

is Helsinki, hase lilien a train do leningrad and then lo Moscuw?.

l 5o decording to your previous infornation, "imy tourist - he leyn a lour

10 the Soviel Union, makes out the ankole, and thres comes lo Moscow."

- In what country die Onwald buy a tour to the USSR? In what country did

Oswald fill in the ankota? If the ankela sues lo Moscow, lo what offico

in thoscow does it go? To MID. KGI?. Is it possiblo that all the data on

Oswald from his ankcia was sent to Moscow by a cable? Did you see and

read Oswald's ankets or a telegram that Oswald is coming to Moscow?

If you did not rend the anketa, who among the KCiB officers of the Second

Chief Directorate or the First Chief Directorate read the anketa or had

access to it? Whe would logically have access lo tho anketa?

vb. Necording to your previous information, any person who wants to visit the

USSR has to buy a tour in a for vign touriat firm in hla home country or any

other country, and the tourist firm will make arrangements for his stay in

the USSR. It is understood that he must fill in the ankota, and in addition to

the general questions, the common tourist should make requests for the

cities he intends to visit and for the accommodations he wants. The tourist

would know in advance when he receives his visa his date of arrival in

Moscow; in what hotel he is going to stay, and what kind of accommodations

he would be given. The question, then; is do you know when Intourist

received Oswald's sequest and application and when it answered him that

his dernands are met and that he is welcome in Moscow?

11. From your knowledge, when Oswald arrived in Moscow, was he handled by

the Intourist Agency or by Sputnik, the Youth Tourist Bureau of the USSR,

or by the Central Council for Tourism of the Soviet Trade Unions?

Note: The Contral Council for Touriem of the Soviet Trade Unions organizes

exchanges of tourists between trade unions of the USSR and other

countries. Sputnik was organized in June 1958 for the exchange of.

of tourists (students and other youths).

J%. You stated proviously that Oswald wish not considered i defector. If he

was not a defeeter, then what was he?

Note:

Il the KGB did not consider Oswald to be a defector, then it is

possible that Oswald was known to the KGB long before his arrival

in the USSK as i tourist and Oswald was assured that when he

arriver in the USSR he would be given Soviet citizenship or-at

least a perinanent residence permil. Although he would be a defector

anyway, it could be that Oswald did not like the word defector

and the KGB decided not to call him a defector but, let us say, a

volunteer.

The Soviet Constitution states that the USSR grants the

right of anylun to all foreign citizens "uto are persccuted for

safeguarding the interests of the working class or who are persecuted

for scientific activitieg, for national-liberation struggle. " (Article

129 of the USSR Constitution of 1936.)

V 10. You stated previously that "since about 1960, every Sovict ambassador

- can give a visa in throo to five days. Il 8o, what was so special for the

Soviet government that the ambassador would be personally involved in

issuing a visa to Oswald?

Note:

It is known that in 1957 the Soviet government adopted some measures

to improve travel for foroign tourists in the USSR.

They mostly

concerned currency eschange.

The 1957 regulations said nothing

about visas. Nosenko should be questioned about the 1957 decision

of the Soviet government to determine if he is not mistaking the 1957

decision with that of 1960.

11. You stated previously that since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador

can give visas in from throe to five days. The available information

published by the Soviets unmistakenly states that a visa cannot be obtained

in less than seven days (in some cases il takes five to seven days). Following

are excerpts from a book entitled Moscow, A Tourists Companion, published

in Moscow in 1969, and from the nagazine Soviet Life, May 1978, p. 59.

Soviet Life staleil that "visas are issued within 10 days of receipt of

application at a Soviet consulate. "

2o. What do you know about Alcksandr Nikiforovich Aksenev?

Note:

(a) Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of the KGB of Belorussia

from 1959 to 1960. It is assumed that when Oswald arrived

in Minsk in January 1960, Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of

of the KGB and would definitely know about the Oswald case.

From 1960 to 1965, Aksenov was MVD Minister of Belorussia.

Therefore it would be under his direction that Oswald's passport

and the departure of Oswald and Marina from Minsk was

arranged. If Nosenko had access to Oswald's file, he must

know about Aksenov. From 1965 to 1971, Aksenov was First

Secretary of the Vitchsk Obkom of CP Belorussia, and since

1971, Aksenov has been Second Secretary of the Central

Committee of the Belorussian CP. He has been a member of

the CC CPSU since 1976, and he is also a deputy to the USSR

Supreme Soviet. On May 9, 1978, Aksenov arrived in Columbia

He headed the Soviet delegation on the invitation of the Columbian

Communist Party.

Marina Orwield Mie an interview in 1961.

Akaraov Is also

mentioned in McMillan's book (pigas 132-1338. Aisenov

allegorily said to Marinas "Tell your husband not to worry.. I

believe your requent willr granted." Also see piage 125 of

the same book.

13. Dirl you linow or know ef Arkadiy Denisovich Rudak?

Note: Budak wag Deputy Chairman of the KGB during 1959 to 1760 and

might have taken part in the Oswald case while. Orwald lived

in Minsk.

1.. Did you know or know of Major General Stepan MIckseyevich Smorodinskiy?

Note:

Smorodinskiy was Deputy Chairman of the KGB for Belorussia in

1962 and must likely know about the Oswald case. His name

would most likely appear in the Oswald file.

J. 5.. Do you know It. General Vasilly Ivanovich Petrov?

Notc:

Petrov was KGB Chairman for Belorussia from 1959 to 1973.

Thereforc, it would be his agency, the KGB, which would watch

Oswald in Minsk. It is safe to assume that after the assassination

of President Kennedy in 1963, Petrov, a Chairman of the KGB

of Belorussia, would review the Oswald file and send it to Moscow.

He would also have been called to Moscow KGB headquarters to

take part in the preparation of the spravka (summary) of the

Oswald file.

,. What do you know about Lit. General Aleksandr Ivanovich Perepelitayn?

Note: Perepelitayn was Chafrman of the KGB of the Belorugsian Republic

from 1954 to 1959. Nosenko should know him or at least about him.

Nosenko should be asked if Perepelitsyn took any part in the

investigation of Oswald. (Perepelitsyn was Deputy Chairman of

the KGB of the USSR from 1959 to 1967. He died in Moscow.)

v%. What part, if any, was played by General Sergey Grigoryevich Bannikov

in the Oswald casc, especially after the assassination of President Kennedy?.

Note:

Bannikov was mentioned by Nosenko as one of the Deputy Chiefs of

the Second Chief Dircctorate and later on as one of the Deputy

Chairmen of the KGB of the USSR.

From 1968 to 1978, Bannikov

was Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court.

V. Nosenko - Nikolayev

~ I. Can you explain why you went to England and Cuba under the name Nikolayev

and to Geneva using your true name, Nosenko? What would have happened

if some Englishman or English intelligence officer had met you in Geneva

in 1962 or in 1964 and grecied you in the presence of the other delegates

15

## Page 113

with the words, "Oh, dr. Nihologes! How are you?

remember you.

You visited England with the team of loxers."

a 1. Fromlhere did you lourn that the Gill was not informed aboul Oswald's

presencr. in the USSR? Wouldn't the GRU officer in Intourist, whom you

mentioned carlier, have known about Oswald's presence in the USSR?

Did you ever hear that Oswald possibly had contact with the Soviet

intelligence during his service

in Japan?

Z.. You stated previously that there was no information that Oswald offered

to give information on the US Marine Corps. You did not read the file.

Then how do you know this to be the case? How do you know that the KGB

and GRU made no attempt to debrief Oswald about his service in the

US Marine Corps?

/ 3. Previously you mentioned one Colonel Voloshin as an officer of the

Dofense Ministry of the USSR. Can you provide any additional information

on this Voloshin? Could it be possible that he was a KGB officer instcad

of in the Defense Ministry?

Note: (a) Accoïding to Epstein's book, one Pavel T. Voloshin was an

administrator at Patrice Lumumba University and was a KGB

officer who accompanied a group of Russian dancers to Los Angeles

in 1959 at just about the same time that Oswald was making

weckend trips there to get his passport and possibly to make other

arrangements for his trip to Moscow. A few weeks after Oswald

decided to return to the United States, he received a letter from

Patrice Lumumba University Signed by Voloshin. (page 111)

(b) P. D. knew one KGB officer by the name of Voloshin (first

and middle name forgotten) who used to work in SMERSH

(military CI) and later in the late 1940's and beginning of the

1950's in S & T Department of the KGB.

VIL. Marina.

i. I. From where did you pick up the information that Marina was a "simple.

óbyvatel" (a politically unaware person) and that she was not anti-Soviet

if you did not rearl the Oswald file?

16

## Page 114

Lo You stated previously that Marina Mrs in Obstatel Do you hase any

comments on the following: "We knew each time you had i date.

We

knew when you applied for your marriage licenue....

We knew the date of

your worlding." These were the words of the loomol recretry in

Mingl: when Marina was expolled from the Komsomol.

" 3. Do you have any comments on Marina's statement when she said,

"Our governinent (Soviet) knows every move I makc." She make this

comment shortly after her expulsion from the Konsomol.

• 4. Did you know that while in Minsk Marina belonged to a group of youths

who gathered together to listen to Voice of America and BBC? Would

that be enough for the KGB to have Marina in its card files? Is it

possible that Marina was the KGB agent reporting on them?

~ S. You stated that if Marina had been recruited by the KGB, you would

know about it and it would be in the file. But you did not rend the file.

How then do you know that she was not recruited?

V 6. You said that among Marina's relatives thero was an officer of the Minsk

Militia, a Lt. Colonel. Do you have any comments on Marina's

revelation that her real father was a traitor and that he was shot? If

her father wag a traitor and he was shot, would his name be in the KGB

card file? Would the name of Marina's mother be in the KGB card file

as the wife of a traitor? Is it then possible that Marina's name also

would be in the KGB card file somewhere?

7. You stated previously that KGB had no interest in Marina prior to her

meeting Oswald and that the KGB investigated her only after Oswald

applied for permission to register marriage with Marina. How do you

know that? Did you read a special file on Marina? Marina revealed

lately that while she was living in Leningrad in 1958 or 1959, she met

a diplomat from Afghanistan who lured her to his hotel room and tried

to make love to her.. Do you think the KGB in Leningrad would know

about this diplomat and whom he lured to his hotel? Is it possible that

about Murini and if alue so used lig the Nite as a leit for forelgures,

night she have idlready beeh an experienced KGB agent?

S. You stated previoualy that you saw Ossald's file only briefly and you

read only a summary. Then how would you know that Marina wins novor

used by the KGD? Did you personally make a direct check on whother or.

not Mirina was a KCB informant?

• 9. In your previous testimony, you eategorically denied that Marina was a

KGB-MVD agent or informor. Do you have any comments on Marina's

statement to Lifo Magazino that she was a "Soviet agent"? Is thoro any

possibility that the KGB or MVD in Belorussia or in Leningrad, whore

Marina had lived previously, had recruitted her as an agent or informer

and she continued to work for the KG or the MVD until hor departuro lo

the US? Did you have any information about the possibility that there was

another file in the KGB on Marina, a file for an agent or informer of the

KGB or MVD? If such a file existed, it muat be reflected in the Oswald

file, as well as in the surnmary which you read.

~ 10. Did you hear or know that while in Leningrad Marina dated one Oleg

Tarugain, a student who had ambitions to enter the Soviet diplomatic

service and who had some trouble with the authorities over a minor

political incident?

v Il. Was there any information in Oswald's file to show that after Oswald

married Marina, Marina was in the hospital for about five days?

v.. 12. What do you know about Marina's vacation in Kharkov shortly after

she married Oswald?

Notc: She may have been in Moscow instead of Kharkov.

13. Did you know that while in Minsk Oswald was in the Fourth Clinical

Hospital for surgery on his adenoids?

(Oswald go: special attention from

the doctors.)

Note: Marina's Aunt Valya, whose husband was an MVD Colonel, sent

case and the death of the American President in Geneva.

V 4. Are you sure that there was no file on Oswald in the KGB before he

arrived in the USSR? How do you know this? Did you personally check it?

¡ 5. You previously told American authorities that on the cover of Oswald's

file "there definitely was a 'klichka'. " But you said you did not remember

the klichka. Do you remember

whether the klichka was one word or two. As you did not read the file,

is it possible that it was an old file, opened a few years previously by

the First Chief Directorate or by the GRU?

matterg." Isn't it true that tho Second Chief Diroctorate is the internal

counterintelligence organization and is responsible for foreigners who

enter the Soviet Union for any reason? Isn't it true that the lourist

department of the Second Chief Directorate is responsible for foreign

tourists such as Oswald? Then why wasn't the Second Chief Directorate

interested in Oswald? Do you see any contradictions in your statement?

15. You stated that there was no altempt made to exploit Oswald for

propaganda purposes, such as Radio. Moscow broadcasts, TV, lectures,

etc. How do you know this? Do you have any comments on the following:

"On October 19 (1960), Lee (Oswald) was interviewed in his foom at the

Hotel Berlin by a correspondent of Radio Moscow, Lev Setyager, who

determined that he was not normal? How many doctors, from what

Institutions, cuncluded that Oswald was not normal? The Second Chief

Directorate and Intourint officers could not cunclude that Oswald was

abnormal without medical expertise.

~ 1% Il Oswald was abnormal, then why did Soviet authorities, for example,

the Ministry of Foreign Alfairs, not Inform the Arnerican Embassy about

it?

Note: In his provious interrogation, Nosenko henitated in answering thoeo

questions.

~ 20. You staied previouely that Oswald was in the hospital, the hoapital said

that Oswald was not normal, and there was no action taken to inform the

American Embassy, Ilow do you know all of this without reading the

Oswald file?

21. Why do you think that the American Embassy would not have takon Oswald

if he had been turned over to them? Do you know that any Soviet

government office contacted the American Embassy and Informed them

about Oswald's presence and the suicide attempt in Moscow?

v 22. Was the only reason that the Soviet Government did not inform the

American Embassy of Oswald's alleged suicide attempt that it was fearod

that he might try it again?

- 23. You

stated that there was no psychological asseasment of Oswald by the

KGB nor by the hospital, and that there was no report of that nature.

You did not read the file. You read only summaries.

Then how could

you know that there was no such report? How long was the summary-

100 pages?

any comments on the fict that alter his arrival in the USSK, and aftor

having made oral regucals for Sovict citizenship, he returned to tho

American Embassy, denounced his US citizenship and throw out his

American passport to the American Consul it the Embassy.

Do you think the KGB monitored Oswald's conversations with the

American Consulate officers or received reporte from the American

Embassy (from Soviet employces there or Soviet agents there) about

Oswald's denunciation of US citizenship? Did the KGB instruct Oswald

to denounce hle American citizenship at the American Embassy before

ho would be permitted to apply for Soviet citizenship?

26. You stated that the decision to give Oswald a stipend was mado by the

Red Cross.. Explain in detail how the Red Cross learned that Oswald

arrived in the USSR. Who informed the Red Cross that there was an

American who needed help? Why was it decided to give halp from the

Red Cross and not from the Trade Unlon? It is understandable that

Oswald might not have had enough money to start a new life in the USSR,

but he was not a poor beggar who needed to be turned to the Red Cross

instoad of the Trade Union. How did you find out that it was the Red Cross

that made the decision? According to available information, the Red

Cross does not assign money to anybody without the recommendation of

some other Soviet office. Which office was it; the KGB, MVD, the

Council of Ministers, Intourist, or the USSR Supreme Soviet? Who

abnormal, then why was he persuitter lo marry a Soviet citizen?

Note:

According to Soviet lan, in every union republic, including

Belorussia, the "ristriage cannot he permitted between persone

if one of them is pressunced é mental case or imbecile."

Did you have any information that the Minsk KGB reported to Muscow

headguarters Oswald's intention to marry a Soviet citizen, in this case,

Marina?

V'28. You stated previously that Oswald's file was sent to the Second Directorale

of the Belorussian KGB. Hen do you know that it was sent specifically

to the Second Directorate and not to the KGB chairman or hie deputy

with a special instruction?

29. What do you mean "to keep an eye on hiri" (Oswald)? That, according

to your words, was the instruction frorn the Seventh Department of the

Second Chic! Directorate to the Belorussian Second Directorate of the KGB.

v30. You stated that there was no visible surveillance of Oswald, there was no

microphone in his apartment, tut you stated his mail was

monitered and

that there were agents arousd Oswald in places where ho worked and lived.

Explain

how you learned about it. Do you know tha names of any

agents who reported on Oswald? If you did not read the file on Oswald,

how could you know about it?

31. Previously you stated that Oswald was handled no differently than any

other American defector. ".... The only difference was that he was not."

to he allowed to stay, and he was considered to be abnormal." Il this was

the only difference, and it is quite a big one, then why was he allowed to

stay in the USSR? Il Oswald was "not normal" according to the KGB

officers, then this should te posed in the Oswald file which was sent to

¡ 32. Do you hase any information that while in the USSk, especially during

the jear 1960-190l, Ornald might have been visiting Cuba?

Note: Nosenko claimed that during October-November 1960, he (Nosenko)

went to Cuba with a group of STATE PLANNING COMMISSION'S

METALURGISTS headed by Ivan Strigen. He stayed in Cuba for

two months.

¿33. Do you have any comments on the statement made by Marina's uncle,

the MVD colonel: "I thought that Alik (Oswald) had not only given up

his American citizenship but had become a citizen of the USSR. "

Note:

The question is that if an MVD colonel thought or could be fooled

by the KGB that Oswald was a Soviet citizen, it is possible that

he really was a citizen or that the KGB spread the rumor that he

Institute in Minsk?

Do you think the KGB knew

about it?

39. Did you know that Oswald was helped to study Russian at the Minsk plant

by one of his co-workers and by one of his friends, Erich, and by a girl

41. What do Oswald's files show about his contacts with Clear students in Minsk?

Note:

McMillan's book stated that Oswald began to soot out the Cuban

students in Minsk, of whom there were 300 or so, 8o learn whist

he could of Castro's revolution.

(Sce page 127.)

12. You stated previously that Oswald was a poor shot and that during his

hunting trips he did not kill anything. Was this information in the summary

you read? Do you have any comments on the fact that according to the

Warren Commission Report and the records of Oswald's service in the

Marines that he, Oswald, was a sharp shooter and marksman? Was

the "fact" that Oswald was a poor shot mentioned in the summary?

43: You stated previously (2'7 and 29 July 1964) that you saw the file on

Oswald only briefly and that the file was at the Seventh Department

for only 35-40 minutes. Then how do you know that nobody in the

Sovict Union, including KGB officers, ever sat down with Oswald and

arrived in Moscow. What material did you use in preparing the spravka?

Was there another file on Oswald in Moscow or was it a control file

(Kontrolnoye delo)?

Note: In important cases the real file is in the place where the subject

lives and works.

In this case, the Oswald file was in Minsk.

Moscow would have an almost identical file on the subject for

control purposes and for instructions on how to handle and

develop the casco

This headquarters file is called the Control

File.

This file crists on the person who is already an agent or

who is under development or training.

for stared thae when the file on Ossald arrised from Ainste Yong

together with other officers looked quickly through the file, then senior

officers

fedosegor aml Maleyer of the First Department of the Second:

Chief Directorale look the file and you nerer saw it again. Because thie

file was in your deparement only 20-30 misutes lin other places Nosenko

said 35-10 minutes), the S pravka could not be willen in such a short

time, and because the file was taken away to the higher authorities of

the Second Chief Directorate and to the KGB chairman, you had no chance

to sce the second Spritvia. Then again the question is which summary

did you read--the second or the first or both? Describe in detail how

long the summary was, what was in it, and how long it look for you to

..rcad-it. -Did-you make any notea from the summary in case later on you

had to report the "facts" to US intelligence?

46. What do you know ibout Oswald's visit (from Minak) to the American

Embassy in Moscow on July 8, 1961?

Notc: Oswald flew from Minsk to Moscow allegedly without permission

from the Soviet authority.

What do you know about Marina's visit to Moscow on July 10, 1961?

What part did the KGB play in the arrangements of Marina's visit to

the American Embassy in Moscow without checking her papers and

without stopping her at the gates. In what hotel in Moscow did Oswald

and Marina stay at that time?

147. You stated previously that the First Chiel Directorate provided no

information about Oswald before Oswald went to Mexico. What

information did the First Chiel Directorate give to the Second Chief

Directorate before he went to Mexico? Did you read this Information?

If you did not personally read it, then how did you learn the contents of

the First Chief Directorate information? Who from the First Chief

talked

Directorate particularlynto the officers of the Second Chiel Directorate

and with whom did they talk?

COMMENTS

One was prepared by the Office of

security and the other by the FBl.

Both reports conclude that NOSENKO

was a bond

fide defector.

A draft

memorandum attached to this file,

dated 21 October 1908 and prepared

by the Cl Staff, raises question

regarding NOSESKD's bond rides

and challenges the above dio reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency.

He is broupht to Washington

periodically to consule ou matters

germane to his background and experience.

Various reports are available in the

files of the Office of Scourity which

dorail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since

the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

do document the rationale for the original

confinement of sostake sore

document the rationale

cor his continued

confinement over so long a period of time.

A memorandum dated 5 Auguse 1969 states

that various congressional staff officors:

were briefed on NOSENKO and states that

concern for his safety, as well as con-

cern regarding his bona fides, prompted

the prolonged confinement.

(2) Office of Security files document

a period

in 1969 during which a mail

cover was

placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

allowed a pleasure trip

to Florida.

During this trip, Agency personnel,

apparent Headquarters approval, obtained

the services of prostitutes.

occasions.

MEMORANDUM FOR: :

Director of Security

SUBJECT:

Parole Status of Dofectora

1. On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Dapartment.

of Justice on the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is defarred

upon arrival at our request and who are then paroled to this agency.

It was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible

for taking any action necessary to carsy out the torms of the parole.

2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the

Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955. Altor setting up

conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states:

"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligenco Agency will assume

responsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it

believes consistent with the internal Jecurity needs of the United Srateo

during continuance of their parole status. " This means that the

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary

, to protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word

"minimum" is not necessarily a limitation. It merely means that good

judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary.

3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the

parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if

internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from

this country through arrangements made by she Agency and, in such

case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

departure.

Effective immediately or as soon as practicable, the following

procedures will apply with regard to the handling of the

Subjecte

(1) Subject will receive a regular diet with modest regulated

portions.

He is to have no dessert or "trimmings," y

but may have the necessary silverware with which to

eat properly. (CAUTION--Extreme care should be

exerciged with regard to controlling the silverware,

and it was suggested that at least two of the guards

be required to count the silverware in and out; that

the silverware be placed on the tray in a manner

where it could be observed before the guards enter

the room, etc. )

(2)

Arraugements are to be made for the installation of

adequate air-conditioning equipment to insure that a

comfortable temperature is maintained. (It is under=

stood that there is quite a bit of equipment available

through Logistics channels.)

(7) In addition to the above, it matist be emphasized that

our attitude toward the Subject will remain precisely

the same, and our security procedures, including

Searches,

will continue to be at maximum control.

-3. It was further ascertained that we will have custody of

the Subject until at least July. It was suggested that perhaps we may

wish to explore some modifications in the assignment of personnel

or schedule of assignments. In addition, the Acting Chief, Support

Branch has suggested that immediate consideration be given to

devising necessary procedures to be followed in the event of an

emergency involving loss of control of the Subject This should

be discussed immediately with the responsible DFO supervisors

and specific procedures devised, and all guards properly informed

as to their responsibilities in this matter.

in regard to this question.

The St:

Division

(then SR) was the

responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until latc

October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the

Office of Security by the DCI.

It is presumed that the DCI was

: The Josenko Case

Attached please find a summary of a document written in

1967 to the Gieneral Counsel outlining the Nosenko case and

explaining to him actions which had been taken with regard to

attitude toward the manner in which he was handled prior to

While one can criticize the fact that Nosenko was kept

incommunicado for approximately three years, and thereforc

presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document

does indicate, ve believe,

of a dilemna

in this regard.

There were logitimate doubts

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

In early or mid-1967, the Agency General Counsel was

provided a summary of the Nosenko case.

The negorandum

sought

an advisory opinion from the General Counsel on the

Agency's legal basis for its handling of liosenko through

that date and on the logal aspects on the eventual dispost-

tion of Nosenko. Shortly subsequent to this senorandum to

the General Counsel, Nosenko took up residence in October 1967

in an apartment in the Washington area and was reminded that

should he wish, he could travel freely anywhere at anytime.

He gradually created a now life for himself in the United

States and has indicated on several occasions that he holds

307.9

no ill feeling about his handling by the Agency at anytime.

Background

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with ClA repre-.

sentatives in Genevi in 1962. He identified hisself as a

staff officer of the KGB's internal security directorate and

offored

to

sell counterintelligence information. This offer

was accepted and he was recruited as an agent in place and

debriefed on counterintelligence matters during five meetings

in Geneva. He then returned to the USSR. He came to Geneva

---

again in January 1964 as the security officer for

the

Soviet

disarmament delegation. Niter a number of mectings with his

CIA handlers he defected on 4 February 1967 and was secretly

taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border.-

on the night of 1/5 February with alias U.S. Army identity

documents.

In Geneva and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,

Nosenko wrote out

an asylum request, requesting political

asylum from

the U.S. Government.

Because serious doubts about Nosenio's bona fides had

arison on the basis of the information he had provided both

in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-

inally planned to do a detailed bona fides debriefing and

assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving.

Nosenko to the United States. However, unpreccuented action

by the Soviet Government in respect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the

press that Nosenko, described as an "expert attached to the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected.

2

## Page 174

Because of mounting pressure from the press, which included

much speculation that Nosenko was a high level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko. au:

request for asylum in. the U.S. and identifying him

as a

member of the KGB. This

was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-

ruary, the Sovict Government delivered a note to the American

Embassy in Moscow asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and

requesting an immediate intervicw with him and his

relcase.

On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-

ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he

accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in

locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected

these charges, the Amcrican Ambassador to Switzerland recom-

mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko.:

to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of

his own free will.

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,

Nosenko was brought to the United States.

He travelled by

commercial air, again using

alias

identification,

and was admitted to the country. at New York City (in true

SEGRET

On 13 Fchruary, representatives

of the Swiss and Sovict

Embassies in Washington advised the State Department that

they desired

interviens with dosenko. On 14. February, in

Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO called in Ambassador

KOHLER and protestéd "impermissable activities" on the part

of the U.S. in Nosenko's case. Soviet press spokesmen took

an even harder line to lestern correspondents, and accused

the U.S. of kidnapping Nosenko. On the afternoon of 14 Sep-

tember, at two separate interviers, he spoke first to Swiss

Embassy and then

to Soviet Enbassy representatives.. At

these intervicws, which were also attended by State Department

and INS officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland

of his own

free will to seek asylum in the U.S. In addition,

he replied

to questions of the Soviet Embassy representative

to the effect that he was renouncing his Soviet.citisenship.

On the evening of 14 February, the.U.S. State Department made

a brief formal reply to the soviet

protest, then

issued a

brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had

been held and that Nosenko had confirmed his desire

to remain

in this country.

on matters affecting their responsibilities. Although allowed

out for cooning and weck-end excursions, Nosento was at all

times accompanied by O/S personnel. In addition, he took ai.

two-weck vacation to lawaii, again accompanied by cuse offi-

cors and socurity guards. Evidence continued to mount that

he was is KGB plant, and it the

same time it became obvious

that it would be impossible to procced further to. resolve

the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen

without changing the conditions in which he was being held.

Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially

when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed

for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance

of an alien registration card. At the same time, vosenko's

heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing

increasing difficulties to the security personnel charged bes

with

keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in

accordance with Agency local responsibility. It was clear

that it was only a matter of time before he created a public.

scandal.. More importantly, he was in a position to communi-

cate with the KGB since physical control could

nut

be absolute.

On 4 April 1964, Nosenio voluntarily underwent a polygraph

examination. The results of this examination indicated deception

on il number of critical points indicating that he wis sent

Dy the KGB to porform one or more missions which also involved

his penetration of the Agency and its operations. It was

decided, therefore, thas the physical circumstances us sasenkors

stay in this country would have to be drastically changed if

the drency were to carry out

its counterintelligence responsi

bilities ind adhere to the torms of the parole agreement. As

a result, he was

moved to quarters where his movements could

be more casily controlled, and his outing privileges vere

suspended pending resolution of bona fides.

It is worth noting that had we not taken the above action

nue accopted Nosento at face value, it is quite possible thae

we sould have proceeded with a series of operational actions

on the basis of his information. The results of some of these

actions could have been very embarrassing to the U.S. Governient

politically and damaging to U.S. national security. for exam-

ple, his chief operational proposal it the time, and one that

he was most insistent

that we should proceed

with immediately,

involved the compromise of a very

senior Soviet official.

investigations. We concluded that it had been established

beyond reusonable doubt that Nosenko was a NiB agent who

established contact with CIA, subsequently defected on NGB

instructions, and that he came to the United States on a

deception mission. The implications of this mission had a

grave and direct

bearing on U.S, national security. Although

our findings were supported by the results of two polygraph

examinations, the nature of the evidence was inadmissable in

not been in a position to perform any overt act of transgres-

sion of U.S. espionage laws since 4 April 1901 when he was.

placed in a restricted area and deprived of any conceivable

means of communication with the KGB.

Nosenko did not admit that he defected on NGB orders

or that he came to the U.S. on a KGe mission.. He has admitted,:

however, that he made numerous lies about his personal history

and about the details of his KGB service to U.S. officials,

both before and after arriving in the United States."

Secretary of State, the Ariorney Genoral, the Special Assis-

tant to the President on National Sccurity Affairs, NcGeorge

Bundy, lioneral Carroll, Director of the Defense Intelligence

Agency and the bl were all notified immediately. On S Febru-

ary 1907, leneral Carter reported the defection to an exicutive

session of USIB and followed this up with formal statements

to

USIB members on 11 and 19 Ichruary 1964, which stated that

Nosenio's bond fides had not yet been established. It wils

agreed that no DS number would he issued to dosenko, and that

he would be

handled

on a special basis by this Agency. In

fact, normal USIB interest in losonto as a defector dropped

off drastically as it became quickly apparent that he had no

positive intelligence

interest of value to any part of the

community.

The President was informed of the full extent of our

suspicions about

Nosenko's bona fides by the then Director,

Mr. Necone, on ll february 1961. Vr. Patrick Coyne, Exccutive

Secretary af the PFlAB, was given * similar briefing by

The secretary of State, inbassador Thompson, ind other

senior officials in the Department of State vere informed of

our reservations about Nosenko's bond fides and our

fears that

he mighe be i dispatched KGB agent. In discussions about the

possibility of Nosenko's eventual deportation, the Secretary

of State expressed serious concern about the adverse resction

that such

i move might have on

other potential défectors.

The Dirceror of Security, Stite Department, was informed

of the bona fides problem at an carly date. We have worked

closely wich this office since then on the problem of cral-

uating the ignificance of losenko's information as it affects

the security interests of the State Department.

Because so much of Nosenko's information affected u.s.

internal

security matters for which the FBI bears primary

responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko was

a LoB plant had a direct bearing

on the validity of certain

F3l operations, the FBI was kept fully informed on our viers

abour liosenko's hona fides and our progress in

interrogating

and investigating him

from

The

bona fides as early as 5 february 1961. The Director of the

F31 and his depur! for Internal Security, Milliam Sullivan,

to have the time to analyze and resolve this case, and to

plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it vas essential

that

we attempt to keep the doB from learning of our awareness

of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed inowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenio, and.

the implications thereof, has restricted tu a very few people

in the Agency and the intelligence community. Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-

• ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of Icakage.

Sovier Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the Soviets

were making a serious effort

to find out what happened to

Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant

and unusual of these was the

approach by a Soviet journalist,

Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the Frerch magazine

Paris Match with an offer to provide photographs and materials

for an exclusive story of losenko and his family, decording

to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering

an

approach

to an

international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain

compensation fron losento for damages caused by his abandon-

ment of her and her children.. In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be from josenio himself,

SECRET

## Page 183

SECRET

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach

to repre-

sent blatant and cruel manipulation

of his fanily by the KGB

and that he will not lend himself to

the scheme by agrecing

to in interview or in any other way.

Nosenko's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions.

of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and vationality

Act.

Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by

the Attorney Gencral under the terms of an agreement executed

by the Attorney General and the Eil on 10 February 1955,

which

states:

"After

parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

care, supervison

and control of a kind and

degree it believes consistent with the internal.

security needs of the United States during con-

tinuance of their parole status."

In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and

because we had reason to believe that josenko was a conscious

and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we

ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

## Page 184

SECRET

States. From 12 February to & April 1904 it was possible to

keep dosenio it a location where he could enjoy a certain

amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.

Aftor # April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was

necessary to keep him incommunicado at a location which is

known to no one outside of the lgency lind to very few within

it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country

under the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically

extended bo the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Although his froedon of movement had been severely

restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-

plaint about his treatment. On the contrary, we had several

written statements from him in which he stated that our

handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

From

the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation

as a contingency measure.

In carly 1964, we thought that it

might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda

drawbachs of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosento

has confessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time,

however, and in vich of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission and our clearer understanding of what

13

SECRET

---

## Page 185

14-00000

SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems

seoud in the way of his deportation to cither the USSR or a

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has catogorically stated on numerous : :"

occasions that he will never contemplate return to the USSR,

and, although we suspect that he might secretly welcome such

is move, we would expect him

to ict out his part to the end

with loud protests.

that he was being shipped to his death,

cte.

when the possibility of expulsion was discussed with

Departnent of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of

State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for

the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-

tors. Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against

long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse

violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United

States.

Under these circumstances

an alleged "confession"

by tosenko would have come under very close scrutiny, and

might have backfired very badly, Another point that had to

be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again

playing their

part, might have refused

to accept Nosenko on

the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.

Third country: Although we believed it likely that

Nosenko would accode to deportation to a third country,

14

SECRET

---

## Page 186

there is certainly no country in the free world on which we

could conceivably have unloaded Nosento without

first

inform-

ing them of his true status. Even if we considered this a

desirable objective, it seemed certain that the Department

os State would veto such a piece of intergovernmental duplic-

ic! on the basis of the political risks involved.

activities within the United Statcs..

The case in question from page 170 of the Commission

is quoted as follows:

"In one other case, a defector

It is not known

whether the following case is identical to the referenced

case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts

appear to be quite similar.

Information developed by this Office of possible in-

an ex-ClA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a

naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926.

Torpats was employed by

Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the

authority granted the DCI under Section 102(C) of the National

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SULLECT: Rockefeller Cornission Contact

Mason Cargill told me today that the reference

in the Commission report to an employee sino was fired

because he abused a defector came from a deposition by

Dick Helms:

Helms could not remember an exact name.

but from the description which he gave on his deposition,

it is clear that the employee who was fired was

Torpats.

He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960.

Torpats, himself a Lithuanian refuace. was working

Germany:

In the course of interrogating another Lithuanian

defector, Torpats beat him.

After Torpats was fired,

the Director (then MicCone). He lost the case.
