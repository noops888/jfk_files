HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

On the morning of July 31, 1978, representatives
of the HSCA questioned Legal Attache RICHARD S. CLARK, London,
England, concerning his knowledge of the investigation con-
cerning JAMES EARL RAY in Mexico.c

Questions were in general terms as to the
nature of our work in this matter in Mexico. Legat CLARK
explained that he was an Assistant Legal Attache in Mexico
at that time, and that while he undoubtedly did some work
in the investigation, he could not recall any specific
assignments or trips without reviewing the resulting reports. ©

Legat CLARK explained the police structure
in Mexico (and the United Kingdom) in general terms, and
identified some of the personalities who might have been
involved in the investigation. ~

tiex received telephonically from a Mr, William V. Gladen, Ocean Sf se ttl
‘Springs, Mississippi, who reported that an acquaintance, Bill Wilson, Wf, re
(rea informed him on 8/17/78 that he had killed Martin Luther King.
Gladen advised that Wilson was drinking at the time he furnished
this information, however, he believes Wilson is a very intelligent
person and thinks he is serious about the murder of King.

SAC, Memphis, at approximately 10 am, today, advised that
he had been telephonically contacted by Shelby County Sheriff Barksdale,
who advised that he had received two telephone calls from a Burgess
Audie Wilson who claimed that he had been "the trigger man" in the
assassination of Dr. King, that his daughter had driven the white
mustang and that he would only surrender to Sheriff Barksdale on
Sunday, 8/20/78, at 9:30 am, at the Holiday Inn in Biloxi, Mississippi.
A subsequent call from SAC, Memphis at 11:35 am this date advised
that Sheriff Barksdale had received additional instructions to the effect
that Wilson was expecting his arrival in Gulfport, Mississippi, on this
date and would meet him at the Holiday Inn at Gulfport,

Contact has been maintained with AAG Robert Keuch who requested
that this information be provided to the House Select Committee on
Assassinations immediately. This was done. Mr. Keuch further
requested that any media inguiries receivéd_—by-any_oMices of thé FBI
be referred to | the Department of Justice. Since it was anticipated that
Sheriff Barksdale might tiiquiré’as ‘t6-FBI and USDJ desires in this
matter, AAG Keuch conferred.with DeputyAAG Turner, Civil Rights
Division, USDJ. Subsequent to the first advisement given Mr. Keuch
in this matter, his office received a telephone call from Sheriff
Barksdale. Mr. Keuch advised that it was the determination of the
Justice Department that Sheriff Barksdale should be contacted by
the FBI and requested, if he so desires, to meet with Wilson and request
Wilson to provide a statement to the FBI or if Wilson was not willing to
do this, to request Wilson to provide a statement to Sheriff Barksdale.

‘Mr. Keuch also requested that the FBI, in the meantime, seek to identify
the daughter and a father-in-law of Wilson who resides in Memphis,
Tennessee, in the event that these persons needed to be contacted in

the future, Mr. Keuch advised that he would personally contact the SAC,
Memphis Division, and ask him to relay these requests to Sheriff
Barksdale since Sheriff Barksdale had tried to contact Mr, Keuch.
personally. Subsequently, SAC Trimbach telephonically advised FBIHQ
of the request of Mr. Keuch's call and confirmed Mr. Keuch's request.

discloses no information identifiable with Burgess Audie Wilson, however, ,
SAC, Memphis advised that information received from Sheriff Barksdale A,
indicates that Wilson is known under FBI #879 421 E, having last been

On August 18, 1978, 1:15 A.M., Mr. William D.
Gladen, Route 1, Post Office Box 205H3, Ocean Springs,
Mississippi, telephone number 875-3518, telephonically
contacted the Jackson Office, Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation. He advised that on August 17, 1978, one of his
employees, Bill Wilson, telephonically requested that he
and Mrs. Gladen meet with him. Thereafter, he and Mrs.
Gladen met Wilson at their card and gift shop located in
Ocean Springs.

Mr. Wilson told them he had killed Martin Luther
King. He talked for one hour concerning the details of
the plan to kill King and stated the sheriff, Memphis,
Tennessee is the only person to whom he will surrender.
Also, he said he is to meet the sheriff at the Holiday Inn,
Biloxi, Mississippi, the morning of August 18, 1978.

Mr. Wilson further advised Mr. and Mrs. Gladen
he is sorry for the expense he caused them in setting up his
watch repair business but he had to get this off his chest.

KING did not leave the motel and spent most of the day in their

room, #306, which is located on the second floor of the motel.

He stated that he and Dr. KING had been gone from their room for

- approximately one hour or less when they returned to the room at

about 5:30 p.m. He said they got dressed as they were going to

dinner at the home of Reverend BILLY KYLE and that at almost exactly

” for a moment and Dr. KING walked out onto the balcony just outside |

Reverend ABERNATHY stated that judging from the sound .
of the noise it appeared that the shot came from directly in
front of the door and not from any great distance. He stated
he did not observe anything that would indicate who fired the
shot. Reverend ABERNATHY also stated that while they were in
the motel room Dr. KING did not, to his knowledge, receive any
telephone calls of a threatening nature or calls from persons
who would not identify themselves, Reverend ABERNATHY said
Dr. KING had not feared that any particular persons might
harm him and Reverend ABERNATHY was unable to suggest any
suspects or to provide any other information which might
assist in identifying Dr. KING’s killer. - :

FD-350 (Rev, 7-16-63)

ie (Mount Clipping in Space Below)

The Citizens Council of America,
“which used to be called the White
* Citizens Council, is an organization

which, despite the dropping of the
racial adjective, still seems primarily
interested in promoting white -su-
“ premacy.
‘The Alabama State Sovereignty
Commission is a legislatively created
s agency which spends $100,000 a year
. from the public treasury.

Executive Secretary Eli Howell’s

, Yationalization notwithstanding, the
Sovereigniy Commission’s spending
of $500 for a survey to be conducted
* by the Citizens Council (with another
"$500 still to be spent) is highly ques-
tionable use of tax funds, some por-

: tion of which is paid by Negro citi-

1 zens of Alabama.

Howell said the Citizens Council is

conduct a survey “on specific ques-
{Njons related to a general understand-

Paget}

“$00 Worth OF Whati\,

ing of the basic principle of oN
tional government and the _ basic
premises of a free society.”

He said that the commission hopes
to get other viewpoints, but acknowl-
edged that “our objective in this case
is not to get a controlled response,

but one that will reflect a conserva-

tive viewpoint.” :

In other words, the Citizens Coun-
cil is getting tax money to conduct a
“survey” to establish a predeter- ,
mined position—which is a curious
way to conduct a poll, even aside
from the questionable allocation of
public funds.

Tg the Sovereignty Commission
wants a conservative view on consti-
tutional government, etc., it can get
it from people a whole lot more qual-
ified as conservative spokesmen than
the Citizens Council; and it can gel
it a whole lot cheaper. 7

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

On August 28, 1978, Special Agent (SA) Robert
F. Pevahouse, Berkeley Resident Agency, Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI), was telephonically contacted by
Mike Eberhardt, House Select Committee on Assassinations.
He was furnished the residence address and telephone
number of SA Pevahouse.

Mr. Eberhardt inquired about the fugitive
investigation of James Earl Ray during the time Ray
was an Unlawful Flight fugitive. He was told SA Pevahouse
received a lead from another office to contact Jerry Ray,
brother of James Earl Ray, who was living in Northbrook,
Illinois at the time. Jerry Ray was contacted telephon-
ically by SA Pevahouse at which time Jerry advised he had
not seen or heard from his brother since prior to his
escape from prison. Jerry Ray also furnished information
he had concerning other members of the family, including
John Ray, none of whom were in the Chicago area. It was
the recollection of SA Pevahouse that John Ray was in the
St. Louis area at the time. SA Pevahouse could not recall
specific time of interview as to number of months prior to
assassination of Martin Luther King. He noted there were
no other relatives or associates of James Earl Ray inter-
viewed in the Chicago area to his knowledge.

Concerning the investigation after the assassina-
tion of Martin Luther King, Mr. Eberhardt inquired as to
knowledge of any specific records from the Sportsman's
Club in Northbrook, Illinois, to show if Jerry Ray was
working at the time of the assassination. SA Pevahouse
stated he could not recall at this late date any specific
records concerning the dates worked, but, as he recalled,
personnel at the Sportsman's Club had indicated Jerry Ray
was there except during regular days ‘off.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Former Agent Cletis B, Bidewell advised on
questioning that he had on at least one occasion inter-
viewed Carol Pepper, sister of James Earl Ray, suspect
in the assassination of Doctor Martin Luther King in
Memphis, Tennessee. At that time, Carol Pepper was
residing in Maplewood, Missouri, and the unlawful flight
to avoid confinement case against James Earl Ray,
resulting from his escape from the Missouri State
Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri, was assigned to
Special Agent (SA) Bidewell in the St. Louis Division,
At this time, no information had been developed indicat-—
ing that James Earl Ray was a suspect in the murder of
Doctor King.

The interview with Carol Pepper was most
frustrating since it appeared she was completely un-
cooperative in furnishing any information concerning the
possible whereabouts of James Earl Ray. To the best
of his recollection, SA Bidewell advised that no other
Agent accompanied him on this interview and two or three young
children, presumably children of Carol Pepper, were in the
home at the time of the interview.

With respect as to how the lead to interview
Carol Pepper was obtained, it was recalled by SA Bidewell
that the lead was developed as a result of background
information furnished by the Kansas City Division,
office of origin in the unlawful flight to avoid confinement
case,: To the best of his recollection, SA Bidewell advised
that no information was obtained through the interview of

John Ray. Former SA Bidewell advised that investiga-
tion conducted by him failed to develop any information
indicating that James Earl Ray had been in the St. Louis
area subsequent to his escape from Missouri State
Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri,

SA Bidewell further recalled that shortly

after his interview with Carol Pepper, James Earl Ray
became the prime suspect in the Doctor King murder and
the case on James Earl Ray was reassigned to an Agent

who could give full time to this matter and no further
investigation was conducted in this matter by SA Bidewell,
other than to cover an occasional minor lead which was
developed during the course of the investigation.
