1, NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE OF 1 MARCH HAS BLOWN THE LID OFF yh

THE SITUATION HERE ONCE AGAIN. SPANISH TRANSLATION OF WHAT
APPEARS TO BE FULL ARTICLE HAS TWO QUOTES BY DAVID PHILLIPS TIED
JO "SOURCES OF INTELLIGENCE" AND "AN OLD OFFICIAL OF THE CIA" IN
SUCH A MANNER THAT ON QUICK Re AY Ne IT APPEARS ALL IS ATTRIBUTABLE
TO DAVID PHILLIPS, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT OF
VENEZUELA DID. NET BURDEN OF THIS SECTION IS THAT WHILE DAVID
PHILLIPS WOULD SWEAR CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND LUIS ECHEVERRIA
ALVAREZ NEVER RECE IVED ANY PERSONAL BRIBES, THE USG GAVE THE
GOV AND GOM FUNDS FOR JOINT OPS OF COMMON BENEFIT. THIS DAVID
PHILLIGG KNEW BECAUSE HE WAS CIA CHIEF IN. BOTH VENEZUELA AND MEXICO.
2. A GOV STATEMENT, ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT'S PRESS OFFICE
LAST NIGHT, CATEGORICALLY DENINES THAT THE GOV HAS EVER RECEIVED
AID IN ANY FORM FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT FOR USE IN INTELLIGENCE

SLANDER, DESIGNED TO DENIGRATE THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA, THEY TRY
TO MALICIOUSLY CLARIFY THE ABOMINABLE CALUMNY REFUTED BY PRESIDENT
CARTER'S LETTER(STATING THAT THE REPORTS HAVE NO BASE) BY USING
TESTIMONY OF AN EX-AGENT OF THE CIA WHO SAYS HE SERVED IN VENEZUELA
WHEN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WAS MINISTER OF INTERIOR". "FINALLY
WE REJECT THE POSSIBLITY THAT THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS (PLURAL)
OF VENEZUELA COULD ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE ASSOCIATED IN ANY WAY IN THESE
ILLEGAL AND SHAMEFUL ACTIVITIES WITH THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT".

3, EVENING OF 1 MARCH CHARGE (DCM) WAS CALLED IN BY
VENEZUELAN FOREIGN MINISTER ESCOVAR SALOM WHO SAID PRESIDENT PEREZ
WAS AGAIN GREATLY OFFENDED BY THE LATEST NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE AND
DEMANDED AN EXPLANATION, DCM REPLIED(1) DAVID PHILLIPS HAS RETIRED AND
IS NO LONGER AN ACTIVE EMPLOYEE OF THE CIAs (2) UNIDENTIFIED
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES" DO’ NOT NECESSARILY
MEAN EX=CIA PERSONNEL AND MAY NOT EVEN BE USG INTELLIGENCE ASSOCIATED
OFFICIALS AND (3) NOWHERE IN THE LATEST STORY IS THERE ANY
INDICATION THAT ANY ACTIVE USG SPOKESMAN IS INVOLVED IN MAKING
STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS. ESCOVAR WAS SURPRISED AND

WAS NO LONGER EMPLOYED BY THE CIA, ESCOVAR, SUPPOSEDLY aT THIS
POINT SPEAKING ONLY FOR HIMSELF AND NOT THE PRESIDENT, SUGGESTED
THAT THE CIA DISAVOW PHILLYPS' STATEMENT. DCM TOLD FORMIN 4HAT
CIA HAS NO CAPABILITY FOR THIS SORT OF THING AND FOR
SOME TIME HAS BEEN UNDER STRICT INJUNCTION NOT TO TALK TO PRESS.
ESCOVAR THEN SUGGESTED THAT USG AT SOME OTHER LEVEL REFUTE LATEST
NYT" DEFAMATION", PERHAPS THROUGH THE CARACAS EMBASSY. DCM REPLIED
THAT OF COURSE HE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO ACT ON ANYTHING LIKE THI'S
BUT WOULD REFER IDEA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CONSIDERATION.
ESCOVAR SAID WHOLE SUBJECT WAS PAINFUL TO PRESIDENT +» THAT IT WOULD
BE USED AGAINST THE AD PARTY BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE FORTHCOMING
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN» AND THE GOV WANTED TO LET IT DIES WAS THERE
NOT SOME WAY THAT THE USG COULD RESTRAIN EX= INTELL IGENCE OFF ICERS
AND THE NEW YORK -TIMES FROM REOPENING THE WOUND. THE
DCM REPLIED THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER SHOULD CERTAINLY REALIZE
IN THE UNITED STATES NO SUCH THING COULD BE DONE; TO WHICH THE
FOREIGN MINISTER RUEFULLY RESPONDED," YES, BUT THE VENEZUELANS DON'T
KNOW THIS".

AGAINST THE C1A AND THE PRESS ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT PEREZ,
DEMONSTRATION WILL BE FROM CATIA SUBURB OF CARACAS TO PLAZA
O'LEARY IN EL SILENCIO SECTION AND OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES _WILL
BE INVITED TO JOIN IN. GUERVARA, WHO IS MEMBER OF JAIME LUSINCHI'S
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE (LUSINCHI IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO
BE CAP'S CHOICE FOR HIS SUCCESSOR), SAID THAT
PEOPLE FROM THE INTERIOR OF VENEZUELA HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR
DESIRE TO JOIN IN THIS DEMONSTRATION. (NOTE THAT AREA CHOSEN
FOR DEMONSTRATION IS +» PROBABLY BY DESIGN, FAR REMOVED FROM EMBASSY
AND OTHER U.Se INSTALLATIONS IN CARACAS AND SHOULD NOT INVOLVE
THEM UNLESS HOTHEADS TAKE OVER AND TRY SOMETHING ON THEIR OWN, )

5, ALL OF FOREGOING TENDS TO REACTIVATE DANGEROUS SITUATION
OF 22 FEBRUARY, ALTHOUGH SO FAR THIS PHASE DOES NoT APPEAR TO HAVE
AS MUCH STEAM -IN IT -AS WHEN CRISIS FIRST DEVELOPED. AS IS NOW
WELL ESTABLISHED» CAP ‘IS. MOST SENSITIVE BORDERING ON PARANOIC,
HIGHLY VOLATILE, AND MORE THAN A LITTLE POLITICALLY OPPORTUNISTIC.
IF THERE 1S FURTHER PR OV OC AT ION, WE CAN PRETTY WELL GUARANTEE THAT
HE WILL REACT STRONGLY, QUITE POSSIBLY STRIKING BACK AT HES
