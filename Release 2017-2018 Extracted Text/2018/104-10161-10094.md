EF: DIRECTOR 990535

1, NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE OF 1 MARCH HAS BLOWN THE LID OFF

THE SITUAT 10N HERE ONCE AGAIN. SPANISH TRANSLATION OF WHAT

APPEARS TO BE FULL ARTICLE HAS TWO QUOTES BY DAVID PHILLIPS TIED

TO "SOURCES OF INTELLIGENCE" AND "AN OLD OFFICIAL OF THE CIA" IN .

SUCH A MANNER THAT ON QUICK REING IT APPEARS ALL IS ATTRIBUTABLE

TO DAVID PHILLIPS, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT OF

•VENEZUELA DID. NET BURDEN OF THIS SECTION IS THAT WHILE DAVID

• PHILLIPS WOULD SWEAR CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND LUIS ECHEVERRIA

ALVAREZ NEVER RECEIVED ANY PERSONAL BRIBES, THE USG GAVE THE

GOV AND GOM FUNDS FOR JOINT OPS OF COMMON BENEFIT. THIS DAVID

PHILLISE KNEW BECAUSE HE WAS CIA CHIEF IN BOTH VENEZUELA AND MEXICO.

2. A GOV STATEMENT, ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT'S PRESS OFFICE

LAST NIGHT, CATEGORICALLY DENINES THAT THE GOV HAS EVER RECEIVED

AID IN ANY FORM FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT FOR USE IN INTELLIGENCE

OPERATIONS, IT SAYS: " IN THE NEW SNYT) VERSION OF THE SPECIFIC

SLANDERO DESIGNED TO DENIGRATE THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA, THEY TRY

TO MALICIOUSLY CLARIFY THE ABOMINABLE CALUMNY REFUTED BY PRESIDENT

CARTER'S LETTER STATING THAT THE REPORTS HAVE NO BASE) BY USING

TESTIMONY OF AN EX-AGENT OF THE CIA WHO SAYS HE SERVED IN VENEZUELA

WHEN PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ WAS MINISTER OF INTERIOR". "FINALLY,

WE REJECT THE POSSIBLITY THAT THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS ( PLURALS

OF VENEZUELA COULD ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE ASSOCIATED IN ANY WAY IN THESE

ILLEGAL AND SHAMEFUL ACTIVITIES WITH THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT".

WAS NO LONGER EMPLOYED BY THE CIA. ESCOVAR, SUPPOSEDLY AT THIS

POINT SPEAKING ONLY FOR HIMSELF AND NOT THE PRESIDENT, SUGGESTED

THAT THE CIA DISAVOW PHILLIPS' STATEMENT. DOM TOLD FORMIN -THAT

CIA HAS NO CAPABILITY FOR THIS SORT OF THING AND FOR

SOME TIME HAS BEEN UNDER STRICT INJUNCTION NOT TO TALK TO PRESS.

ESCOVAR THEN SUGGESTED THAT USG AT SOME OTHER LEVEL REFUTE LATEST

NYT" DEFAMATION", PERHAPS THROUGH THE CARACAS EMBASSY, DOM REPLIED

THAT OF COURSE HE HAD NO AUTHORITY TO ACT ON ANYTHING LIKE THI'S

BUT WOULD REFER IDEA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR CONSIDERATION.

ESCOVAR SAID WHOLE SUBJECT WAS PAINFUL TO PRESIDENT • THAT IT WOULD

BE USED AGAINST THE AD PARTY BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE FORTHCOMING

ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND THE GOV WANTED TO LET IT DIE: WAS THERE

NOT SOME WAY THAT THE USG COULD RESTRAIN EX-INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS

AND THE NEW YORK: TIMES FROM REOPENING THE WOUND. THE

DEM REPLIED THAT THE FOREIGN MINISTER SHOULD CERTAINLY REALIZE

IN THE UNITED STATES NO SUCH THING COULD BE DONE; TO WHICH THE

• FOREIGN MINISTER RUEFULLY RESPONDED," YES, BUT THE VENEZUELANS DON'T

KNOW THIS".

DEMONSTRATION WILL BE FROM CATIA SUBURB OF CARACAS TO PLAZA

BE INVITED TO JOIN IN. GUERVARA, WHO IS MEMBER OF JAIME LUSINCHIIS

PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE (LUSINCHI IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO

PEOPLE FROM THE INTERIOR OF VENEZUELA HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED THEIR
