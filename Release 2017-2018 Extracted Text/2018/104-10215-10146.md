FRANK. - Frank wag the hardest working student of the group.

He con

sistently ar

led himself to all phases of the

aining with equal and

great diligence. However, his practical work, which took him a

great deal of time to perform, was always a little sloppy. When

Frank crimped detonators or threw improvised grenades,

he was

very shaky.

However, he did not seem at all nervous about working

with other hazardous material. He asked many pertinent questions

which contributed to the group's training and always answered test

questions correctly and in detail. He was cooperative and reacted

well to correction.

Some supervision was required since the staff

instructors were concerned about his nervousness with detonators.

His overall performance was rated as proficient.
