MM 790-PC. on 1/15/62 advised that he can :
positively state that in Feb. and Mar., 1961, no bookmaking
activity took place on the telephone at Angelo's Restaurant
operated by FRANK DIOGUARDI (Miami File 92-405) and that a

. good source has told him the same is also true at present.
He also advised that in late 1960 DIOGUARDI bought into a
pizza Place at 1957 - 71st St., Miami Beach, Fla., but’ saw it
- was going to be a losing proposition and sold it promptly to,
ANTHONY RANDAZZO (Miami File 92-403), which was then called
Casa Randazzo.

SYLVIA JACOBSON, PCI, on 1/15/62, advised that she
learned (FNU) ROUVILLE, a French baker who sells bakery
products to the Brook Restaurant, Dade County, Fla., wanted to
make a, $500. loan from FRANK DIOGUARDI. Since FRANK DIOGUARDI
did not have any cash available, she thinks that the money’
for the loan was obtained from ANTHONY RICCI (Miami File
g2-112). She learned in addition ROUVILLE would have to
repay $620. for the use of the money for a month or six weeks.

Ib c= Wick NORMAN STEINBERG, PCI, on 2/2/62 advised that he

concern in 9/61, but has no machines or cigarettes :

to date. From information he received, he learned that if the
sale to ACE SAXON goes through, DIOGUARDI will, a short time
later endeavor to secure his old customers for CORICA who is
just a "front" for DIOGUARDI. STEINBERG also learned DIOGUARDI
owes $55,000. on juke box and cigarette vending machines to
SID WOLF, a Jacksonville, Fla. distributor and owes $19,000.

to the Continental Vending Co. which they have agreed to

settle for $15,000. if the above-mentioned sale goes through.

Miami has been conducting fisurs on HYMAN MARTIN
(Miami File 92-218) and his associates in a bolita operation
in support of MM 788-c*.

bolita operation, his associates, and contacts. MM 788-c*
has also furnished information concerning the corruption of
law enforcement officers in connection with the bolita opera-
tion. Details concerning same has been furnished to the Bureau
in separate communications in Miami File 92-218.

The "Miami Herald" Newspaper 2/2/62 carried the
syndicated column of DREW PEARSON which pertained to alleged
travel of Chicago "mobsters" to Miami, Fla. In adjoining
columns on the same page, AL FINKELSTEIN, a Herald staff writer,
under caption, "Plenty of Hoods 'In and Out' But no
Apalachin, Say Police" set forth interviews with DANIEL SULLIVAN
operating Manager of the Crime Commission of Greater Miami;
Sheriff TOM KELLY; Detective Captain C. W. HUDDLESTON, Miami
Beach PD; LEONARD MELLON, Assistant Fla. Attorney General in
Miami, and MARTIN DARDIS, Chief Investigator for the Fla.
Attorney General's Office, and all: commented relative to the
influx of "racket figures" during the winter, but no informa-
tion was set forth that they had any knowledge that any meeting
was to take place in Miami.

Miami has requested Bureau authority to utilize a

highly confidential technique at the apartment of ANNETTE LANSKY,
daughter-in-law of of MEYER LANSKY. (Miami File 92-102).
