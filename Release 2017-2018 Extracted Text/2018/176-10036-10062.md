HIROYUK! TOLD REVUELTA THAT RECRUITMENT OF JAPANESE CREWS WOULD BE.

FEASIBLE IF THE CONTRACT TERMS WERE ATTRACTIVE.

4. THE LATEST PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY REVUELTA TO JAAEC OFFICIALS

CALLS FOR A TRIANGULAR ROUTE LINKING JAPAN, CUBA, AND CHINA. UNDER

THIS PROPOSAL, A JAPANESE SHIP WOULD CARRY JAPANESE EXPORTS TO CUBA,

LOAD SUGAR IN CUBA FOR SHIPMENT TO CHINA AND JAPAN, PROCEED TO CHINA

TO UNLOAD SUGAR FOR CHINA AND LOAD CHINESE EXPORTS. TO JAPAN, AND THEN

RETURN TO JAPAN.

• 5.: WHEN UMEHARA TOLD A MITSUI LINE OFFICIAL OF REVUELTA'S LATEST

PROPOSAL, THE SHIPPING OFFICIAL COMMENTED THAT THE IDEA WAS INTERESTING.

HE THOUGHT THAT. THE VOLUME OF SUGAR SHIPMENTS TO CHINA AND JAPAN

WOULD: BE. ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE SMALL. VOLUME OF CARGO BETWEEN JAPAN

AND CUBA, BUT EXPRESSED DOUBT OVER THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT

CARGO TO MAKE THE CHINA-JAPAN LEG OF THE TRIANGULAR ROUTE PROFITABLE

FOR JAPANESE SHIPPING COMPANIES.
