As you will note from Ref, the Mexico City Station was unable to

locate LIONION-1 in Mexico and believes he may be in Spain. We are

preparing a priority cable for the

which will give them

the background and ask their assistance in locating him. We are not

asking them to contact him at this time.

The Mexico Station also drew a blank on the whereabouts of Viola

June COBB, AKA June COBB Sharp, and Henry P. Lopez. It will be noted

that the Station carried out pretty thorough investigation, and there

seems to be nothing to indicate either are now in Mexico.

efforts to locate them in Mexico.

on their last known whereabouts

a) Viola June COBB Sharp was known

to have been in New York City in

1968. We have no address there. As of about 1960, her father,
