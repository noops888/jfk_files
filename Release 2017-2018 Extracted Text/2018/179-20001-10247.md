introduced computers in the

andlysis of different

aspects

of politics, military planning,

strategical planning and

other such

matters.

He was considered

by the Soviets to be

a very serious man

who could be relied upon and who was true

to his vord.

This latter was particularly pleasing to the

Soviets since they do not like

statesmen who frequently

change their minds and their statements.

Kennedy was the

first President the Soviets felt they could deal wich

on 2

cooperative level with promising prospects since President

Exanklin D. Roosevelt.

The Soviets considered him to be

one of the

most promising nen through whom the Soviets could

arrange relations with the United States and with whom thero

were far ranging prospects of cooperation.

Informant pointed out that

upon hearing the

new's

of the assassination of President Kennedy, a unique situation

occurred in

Moscow, in that the people who walked in the

streets of Moscow were in tears and mournful music was

ployed on the zadio.

Informant stated parcicularly since this

of the people was unique.

Informant pointed out that,

Informant stated that ordinarily the KGB has 2n

interest in all. Americans visiting the Soviet Union ard

that

initially

all such individuals

are studied to determine

if they have

any intelligence potential.

However, in regard

Harvey Oswald, informont is of the opinion

initially the KGB ascertained that Oswald was psychologically

unstable and unreliable.

While the possibility exists that

the KGB made some cÃªfort to study Oswald and may actually

have established a relationship with him,

informant is firmly

of the opinion that the KCB concluded thut he was unstable

aud unreliable, that

mistake

that he

admitted to the Soviet Union and

they were

glad when he

left

the USSR.

Informant advised that in regard to Oswald's wife,

Mazinas

she was considered by the

Soviets

to be somewhat

mentally unstable and was similar in this regard to Lee Haryey

Osweld.
