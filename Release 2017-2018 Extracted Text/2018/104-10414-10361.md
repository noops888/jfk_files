PROJECE LIONION .6e

Identification. This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance

operation against the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

i
Objectives. The operation is designed to (1) furnish photographie coverage
during daylight hours of the entrances of the target installation, (2)
dispatch physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the
target, and (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring and
recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

The target installation is the -PBRUMEN Embassy compound (including
Consulate) in Mexico City. The above-listed objectives are accomplished by
two treined, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street from
the target. :

The project is in consonance with Priority A, Objective 1, of the
current Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

C. Background, This project, herewith presented for approval for the first time,

does not represent a new operation. LIONION activity has been going on since
1962 and costs have heretofore been charged to PBRUMEN FI funds. ‘The
operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMEN Enbassy,
both staff and visitors. These photographs are normally reviewed for identi-
fications by the PBRUMEN section at the S: i
LYDAMIL-9) ana LITAMIL-7 Who are péenétYatic ai ing the target.)
They are subsequently forwarded to the CI section of WH/SA where they are shown
to PBRUMEN intelligence defectors ‘AMNIP-1 and AVMUG-1. Of those assets to whon
they are routinely shown, LITAMIL- 9 has to date made the largest number of
identifications. The photos have/proven of great value. Within hours of the
arrival of a new Enbassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the
Station; In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos
(accompanied by a log kept by the; LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action
(arrivals and departures) and details of personal associations (who associates
with whom) which are of great value to tne Station in mounting operations against
the target. i

- In addition to photography, LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 are often called upon
to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIONION-1 is essential
to the dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance team against individuals
associated with the target. Because of the presence of police patrol cars in
the vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the
target, hence the need for LIONION-l's dispatching services.

The presence of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 also insures continued occupancy of
a valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the
Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in the
target in the form of concealed radio transmitters.



D. Operational Assets (Personnel).

LIONION-1 is a young PRRUMEN lawyer in exile. He left PBRUMEN in 1960,
planning to continue on via Mexico to the United States where he resided in
his early years. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer
in the Department of Commerce in Washington, the other a police official in
Tampa, Florida. While in Mexico LIONION-1 was recruited, as LILILY-1, to
perform PERUMEN operational support services for the Station and, once having
a taste of clandestine activity, decided to remain in Mexico. LIONION-2, (His
was recruited in 1961, as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and
operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE teghnical operation aimed at the PBRUMEN
REobassy. At this same time LIONION-1 also phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and
the two worked together as a team. In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked
together in processing the take of the LIFEAT/LIERODE/M@IRAP installation, now
known as LIOMEN. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-1 and
2 to LIFEUD-22 and 23, respectively. In the latter part of 1962 the two agents
began the present photographic surveillance operation.

LIONION-1 was granted an OA on 18 May 1962 by HMMW~-10664. He was
LCFLUITERED on 8 October. 1963, HMMW-12064,

LIONION-2 was granted an OA on 16 May 1962 by HMMW-10660.

LIONION-1 is the mainstay, of the operation. LIONION-2 acts as his assistant
and fill-in at such times as he id absent from the observation post. Both serve
principally as observers and photographers. LIONION-1 also acts as a dispatcher
for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team from which he is compartmented. Dispatching
is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not
know LIONION-1 or his precise location. LIONION-1 also processes on the premises
all photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing, croppin
and mounting. Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through th
negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of
the agents, that as PBRUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might
be brought upon them by KUBARK througii the Mexican government should they get out
of line, Motivation is a combination of financial necessity end violent aversion
to, and determination to bring about the downfall of, the AMTHUG regime. An
additional motivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what for many woul
be monotonous work. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of work

Both agents realize that they are working for PBPRIME intelligence; LIONION-1

appears to is working for KUBARK. ilized by LIONION-
is that of LIONION-1 passes as al who can afford
to dabble without notable’ success because OF Tami. oldings in

Tampa, Florida (inherited from his deceased father), which enable him to live as
a “rentista," one who lives on income from sources other than gainful employment.
His rentista status is registered with the Mexican government. In October 1964
this cover successfully withstood intensive investigation by Mexican authorities
checking on persons of questionable status far tax collection purposes. The

Station plans to bolster See with supporting documents from a
[pzent in New York City; these will be requested in separate correspondenc

H
Commnication is primarily with LIONION-1; with LIONION-2 only in his
absence. Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls
from LIONION-L go through a telephone cut-out) » are usually held at the
LIONION-1 safe apartment. This apartment, which would appear to be a LIONION-1
love nest, is in another area of town. The Station KURIOT technician,
Hugh T. FRANCOITE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week. The Case Officer,
Lawrence F. BARKER, meets with him less frequently. Whereas LIONION-1 knows
the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOITE's true identity.

Security Evaluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican
authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMWAVE
area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering
their income. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flagrante
with the KURIOL automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such
refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.
In eny event, LIONION~1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexicen
president's office, This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his ow protection
enabled him to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him-to overcome any
future difficulties with Mexican authorities.

Under Mexican law, the principal (photographic) activity of the project is
not illegal, therefore uncovering of the photographic operation would not of
itself result in arrest or prosecution. It is usually possible to stave off
investigation or house search for a period of time sufficient to remove compromis-
ing material from the premises. The LIONION base house was once cleaned completely
in one evening and could again be cleaned, probably in less time, if circumstances
should warrant. ~

The target installation is aware that photo surveillance is a probability.
On one occasion AMKNOB-1, a JMWAVE asset, was. shown a nearby building (not the
LIONION base) by a PBRUMEN Enbassy officer. and told that it was a KUBARK photo
base.

LIONION-1 is known by sight to some PBRUMEN Embassy staff personnel who have
observed him in the neighborhood. Presumably they helieve he is a Mexican. To
avold operational compromise, he cannot renew his expired passport at the
PBRUMEN Consulate. For this reason the Station will request KURIOT in separate
correspondence to prepare new passports for both LIONION agents so that they may
travel outside Mexico.

Security measures employed in this operation are designed to make it virtually
impossible for any opposition service to link LIONION personnel with the Station.

Coordination. Coordination with other PBPRIME elements or the Mexican government

is not necessary at this time and none is envisaged.
