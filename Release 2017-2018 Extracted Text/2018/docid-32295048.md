NES. MELVIN JOHN (LUCY) BLOSSOM had said

that if she was not

left alone (in regard to testifying in U. S. VS. BONANNO,

ET AL),

she would swear

that an FBI man got fresh with her

and that when this agent and another came to her house to

serve a subpoena on her they placed the subpoena down her

front, pointing to her bosom.

SHOEMAKER alleges she said that this happened in

the past three or four months and involved investigators who

had been contacting her in the past three or four months.

For the Bureau's information, Mrs. BLOSSOM has

not been contacted by any FBI Special Agent for over a year

and no FBI Agent, of course, has served any subpoena on Mrs.

BLOSSOM.

It is pointed out that Mes. BLOSSOM'S husband,

MELVIN JORN BLOSSOM, was formerly Confidential Informant

AL 3002-C.

He was initially contacted by Albany Agents

on 4/28/58, after a prior contact by Buffalo Agents while he

was being treated at the Veterans Administration Hospital,

Bath, New York. BLOSSOM was designated a Confidential

Informant by Albany letter, 8/6,58,

and was deleted as an

Informant, for lack of production, by letter dated 3/2412%.

Mrs. BLOSSOM was seen on occasions by agents in connection

with locating her husband.

In SMOEMAKER'S statement, allegations also appear

that Mes. BLOSSOM'S father, PETER SIRANO, 39 Walnut street,

Binghamton, New York (who has in the past been comicced to

a mental institution, according to SHOEMAKER'S statement),

instructed Ms. and Mrs. BLOSSOM befose they went before the

Grand Jury (in New

York City) not to say anything about what

happened at JOSEPH BARBARA'S and they agreed not to do so.

Among other items,

sHOEMaKER further alleged that ties. the

BLOSSOMssaid, in his presence, that the BARBARAS had a secret

tunnel on the property and that something in it would be quite

a surprise to somebody.

Two Thermofax copies of SHOEMAKER'S original

statement are attached for the Bureau's information.

SHOEMAKER has requested that the information he furnished

be held confidential.

In respect to SHOEMAKER, it is noted (as set out

in detail in the attached letterhead memorandum) that in

1950 he was charged with soliciting in respect to his wife

and that they both received jail terms in respect thereto.

In addition,

as set out in the memorandum, information was

received that he was again soliciting for his wife.

In respect to Mrs, LUCY BLOSSOM, she was operated

on about two and a half weeks ago at the Tioga General

hospital, Waverly, New York, for breast cancer and returned

• the hospital on 11/9/59, for another operation.

On 11/13/59 Mrs. BLOSSOM's doctor advised that

Mrs: BLOSSOM would be reheased from Tloga General Hospital

on the evening of 11/13/59 and would be at her residence and

available for interview at that time.

In view of this agents from Albany are proceeding

to Apalachin, New York to interview Mrs, BLOSSOM regarding
