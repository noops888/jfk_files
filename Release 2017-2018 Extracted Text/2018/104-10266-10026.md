was reached that the WOFIRM relationship with her would be terminated.
A memorandum of contact (NYM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached
herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination. No admin-

was formally terminated once before (1966). Her file can be retired,

. again, and this time presumably will be the last time.

2. Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/1 nolds no ill-
will for WOFIRM: she just does not wish to have any relationship
with WOFIRM anymore.

3. The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time
to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the
meeting to wish the writer a pleasant Easter, as she had forgotten *

to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal
contact.

6. I knew something was bothering LICOOXY/1 and made her {
drag it out into the open. ; She stacced by remarking that WOPIRM
ane its computer apparently checked the welfare of its old agents
. every so often, and that this was the nature of our relationship.
peti 1 explained that this was not the case, that I had found out she
pent was in Manhattan and suggested to Washington that LICCOXY/1 '
Might be of some value to us. This surprised her, and she apolo- ;
gized. She then took off on how when she was in Cubaitshe had
dealt with Pidel and Che and Celia, and when sie was invo.ved
with Guatemala she was dealing with AREVALO. She said that she
didn't want to sound snobbish, but that she was accustomed to
dealing with top politicos and intellectuais; she referrd to a
statement that I had made previously that perhaps she couid get
Tana de GAMEZ to invite her along to one oZ Tana's lunches with
Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALARCON Quesada. She said
that she didn't want WOFI24 to thing that she would secx out and
: cultivate lower level people, that she wasn't built that way. f
one LICOOKY/1 said thac even though Tana was a friend and that she |
daked ner, Tana was not ner ecuas, ana tnat * t
“pedestal”. That ALARCON was certainiy not i CooKY/1's intellectual
category. LICOOX¥/1 said that she cons seli as very flexible,
. but not that much. LICOOXY/l is a “special person” and that
+ * WOFIR4 bureaucracy’ -- with the exceptions of “Bill” (ner Mexico |
bile case officer, a H/L (with whom LICOOKY/2
4 is particularly taxen), and writer (LICOCOKY/1 repeatedly assured
me that she had @ very sincere esteen for me) -- probably didn't
understand or acknowiedge this. LiCOCXY/1 said her feelings for
certain WOPiRMers were one thing, but ner dislike of WOFIRM itself
+ was something else. WOFIRM is a massive card index that shows Miguel
Angel ASTURIAS as an old “Nicaraguan war-horse” -- ASTURIAS of
course is Guatemalan. LICOOKY/1 couldn't stop liking Communists |
regardless of WOFIAi desires. i H

wash & ‘Ui bee

ee iH 7. LICOOKY/1 went on and on in this/similar veins, very
rete ss impassioned, but very straightforward and without personal rancor

+ for the writer. Summing up, the stated reasons as to why she does
. hot wish to continue regular collaboration with WOFIRM are as
follows:

A., fear of compromise = LICGOXY/] said that were her
relationship with us to become known, it woud ruin her

ACTION ReQ: Per paral & 7 ‘

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/2 on 7 March 1968, the agent
passed on the following inforzation which may be of interest to the
appropriate Headquartars components. L/l apologized for the lack
of details, but the agent was not in a, position to puzp for further
information beyond that which was voluntesred.

2. On 7 March Tana de GA‘SZ, a naturalized U.S. citizen of
Spanish origin, said that she had been tzlephoned the night before by
the can af haw halfictetar Horcedan (Test name unknown to L/1), her
nephew Roy. The latter is a college stuijent somewhere in Connecticut
(possibly the University of Connecticut), and his hone is somewhere
in Westchester County. Roy said that he was calling his Aunt Tana
because he knew that she had worked for CSS during wiII; Tana
rejoined that she had never had anything to io with OSS, that she
had worked for the Office of sar Inforzation (CWi). At any rate,
Roy said that he wentsd %o tell his Aunt Tana that he had been
*recruited” by the CIA, and that he was only going to work for the
CIA $0 as to evade th: draft. ‘Upon being questicned on this, Roy
maintained that ha had been “recruited’ 5; the CIA cn campus.

3. The nephew's statements rather rattled Tana de GAYEZ, to
the point where she had to take her heart medicine for palpitations
(she has a heart history). Azong other things, Tana was upset by the
thought of a family senber being affiliated with the C14, even though
the nephew is disliked by her as an individual.

&. Tana de GAYSZ was a neuber of the U.S. delegation to the _
Havana Cultural Congress in January 1968. She is a well-known figure
in the intellectual leftist set in New York, and is outspokenly pro-
Castro. She is a menber of the editorial board of Grove Press; is
a published author nerself; ani is a close friend and associate of
John GBRASSI, formarly of Razparts Mazazine. H

Job for Fidel Castro with the idea of faailiarizing the
American people with Castro's writing. June Cobb believes 1
Castro is coing a trerendous job in reconstructing the |
economy of Cuba, However, she stated that in her opinion ‘
it ig unthinkable that Communism would ever be cabraced by

no significance attached to the report. ‘

LICOOKY-1 has been terminated effective 1 July 1966,
Tho last meeting with her was held on 23 dune. © Bhe was
paid her salary through 30 June, her income t:x refund
for the period 1 January 1965 ~ 30 June 1966 and given
‘money for one-way air fare to New York City, She was
completely satisfied with the financial terus of the
settlement. A Termination Secrecy Oath, signed in true

I-1 plans to return to New York on or about 1 July. She
gaid she will look for a job there, and is confident she
will have no difficulty obtaining one. She does not yet
know where she will be living. : :

L-l is subletting the apartment she occupies here. She

- bas purchased the KUBARK-owned household effects which .
- had been loaned to her for that apartment. For this

reason, in addition to the fact that she has acquired

many close friends and interests here as a result of five

years residcace, the Station expects that she will return
to Mexico, although she insists she has no plans to do

ia 4. She was given a hddress to use to contact

the Station in the event that she does returd to Mexico

and feels it necessary to do so, But no committment was

made to her regarding any future contact or payment for

information. Beets

5. She was previously told that the telephone number of the

KUBARK office is listed in the directory and

he could call that office if contact were necessary vhile
she was in the United States. She asked if that would

still be the case and was told that it was but only to
attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter.
But since she tends to liberally apply importance to a

wide variety of events and subjects, and since she is

likely to be short of money shortly after arriving, it
Would not be surprising if she did try to establish such
+ contact, , :

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT “: Request for Termination of Project LICOOKY

:

The LICOOKY Project was last approved for the pertod |
i canuary 3965 through 31 Decenser 1965 for $5.140-- £2,530
for FY 1965 and $2,610 tor FY 1966, it 1s requested that |
the LICOOKY Project be terminated effective 1 January 1966,
based on the foliowisg information geared to the outline
in CSI-F NO, 230-60.

(1) Project Name! LICOOZY

(a) Original Project Objectives: Identify and report
on plans. activities and aseociates of Central

American Communists resident in or visiting Mexico
9 0

(3) Reason for Termination: LICOOKY-1 lost her access
to the hard core group of CA conmuaists rartly
because of her close asyocaarion with LISLUCK who i
Publicly renounced hix break with the G.atenalan
CP in 1962, The loss ct! access was also partly
due to Lsl's own apparent indiscretion 35
soze of her close friends in ¥exico City. This
can be attributed both to her cr. growing distaste

for the grubby and biicdly usteasoning menbers of

3

this group with wtoa she was asked to consort, and

her reaction in her social <rcup which took the

form increasingly of arts-Conauniat remarka, and.

to the concomitant ‘or possitly resultant) rumors

rreney. that ene was in the pay

Attempts were made to take advantage

of her connections with literary circles in

Mexico, but her inatility budget her tane, .
sufficiently to satisfy station requirerents led :
to the decision to terminate ner. A contributing

cause was also her inability to regularize her

6tatus in Mexico se she could accept @ paying

position which would give her reason to remain

there, with the resultant strain of the thin

legend that her father was providing ker support.

(Attachment B) continued the atteck on ‘the Conference and its participests,
Slaining in effect tet it is a cleer anti-Soviet move backed by ODACID. As of
2 Yay, according to the article, nuzerous signatures had been collectes on a
‘Progressive ranifesto” protesting tie Conference. The list includes meny well
known Mexican Communists and pro-Communists. Attached also (Attachment C) is a
copy of the "progressive manifesto", which was published in 21 Dfa on 13 May 1966, i ’
and a copy of a menifes-o (Attachmert D) published in El Hera'jo, 22 April 1966, :
by the Mexican Comittee for the DeZerse of the Jevs in the USSR, in which a
mucber of demands are rade on the Seviet Governnent with respect to the Jews end
their righta. :

3. La Voz de Mextco,15 May 1946 (Attachment E) carried an article bitterly
attacking the Conference, which it charges is being organized and held by groups
and persons in the service of ODACID. It specifically nemes LICOOKY-1, elthough
the latter's reme is ircorrectly syelled, as one of those responsible for the
Conference and seys she is "well connected" with ODYOKE police. Sucesos,
21 May 1966, carried en article (Attechment F) attacking the Conference end ite =
organizers ana charging toat tuere mic siuinecs Swe Potize the tt :

‘This article carries a picture of LICOOKY-1.

4, Sucesos, 4 June 1966, included an inserted sheet (not found in all copies |
of this edi’ ) entitled "An Agent of the FBI and INTERPOL in the Association of _
Mexican Writers,” which deals almost exclusively with LICOCKY-1, her ezpulsion fran ‘
a Cuba, work in Mexico, end contects end activities in Mexico, It cherges that in
‘ Mexico she is working for Daniel Jezes, vho is responsible to KUBARK (Attachment G).) “+

ou eppeered in a notice (Attachment B)[ 4 '
Vicente E-heverrfa del Prado, treasi <THE MEET can ‘ ‘
Gesociation of Writers (AEM - Asociecion de Escritores de México, A.C.), which : : :

sixply stated that LICOOKY-1 is not authorized to accept dues or handle other
business of the AEM vithin the province of the treasurer's cuties and obligations.
Hovever, in view of the adverse putlicity previously, the announcement Led the
effect or implied thet the AEMAC or renbers of that group believed the charges
that LICOOKY-1 hed a part in organizing the Conference and/or is an agext of
KUBARK. The notice, es it appears, also implies that LICOCKY-1 was mishandling
AEVAC funds. Echeverrfe offered to rublish the clarification on the sceet on
which the AEMAC enrouncenent appeers; however, LICOOKY-1 asked him not to do so ant
-eaid she vould take up the notice and any clarification with the AEMAC Justice and
Bonor Comission.

6. On 9 June 1966 while conversing witn SEMO (Attachzent I), Leonov said
that LICOOKY-1 had called him to say that she had had nothing to do wits the
Conference, and does not want the Soviets to catalogue her as an enemy. Leonov
commented that LICOOKY-1 tad left hin her phone’ number and bed esked hia to help
ber (presumably refute the charges that she was involved with the Conference).
Ghe LILINK case officer vio currently hendles LICOOKY-1 said on the oraing of
1S June 1966 that LICOCKY41 told him she had called the Soviet Press Attaché to
@eny that she hed had anything to do with the Conference “because it is what she
would normally do." Ske did not, bovever, mention beforehand that she intended
to call the Soviet Enbassy.

CORTINUATION-OF DISPATCH 3 / RMA-2920T

J. The Station believes that most or all articles ettacking the Conference,
end particularly those attacking LICOOKY-1, were Soviet inapired, and it is further
believed that SEMO wrote most 1f not al) articles attacking the Conference which
@ppeared in La Voz, Pciftica and Sucecos. The boviets, who are probably ewere of:
previous Cuben charges tat LICOOKY-1 is an ODYOKE agent, probebly felt that as
@n Americen closely essociated with the AE“AC LICOGKY-1 vould be vulnerable to
such en attack. i

8, As a result of the Sucesos article of 4 June 1556 on official from the
Ministry of Government did visit LICOOKY-1 to check on ter documentation, The
officiel said that he 2id not believe the cherges mede in the Sucesos article,
but since her tourist visa kad expired he edvised her to imedlately leave the
country in order to rexew it, end he provided her with a letter to shov to
Mexican border authorities pernitting her exit. She is currently in P2PRD® but
to2 to rete th Mexico in a few days. ;

9. As Headquarters is evare, LICOOKY-1 will be tersinated effective
30 June 1966; the decision to terminate her vas made cone time ago, prior to the
occurrence of the Conference end the resulting adverse propeganda., While she
be of enue occasional use siould she return to end rezain in Mexico, it is
believed thet the recent adverse propagenda has impaired cer future usefulness
in Nexico, although reny Mexicans undoubtedly do not believe the charges and
others offered to "cone to her defense.”

20, A dispatch will be prepared and forwarded when the termination has been
completed, end any rey developments with respect to her alleged participation in

the above Conference will t+ included in that dispatch, Hi

LICOOKY-1 has continued to devote the bulk of her

time to the Mexican Writers’ Association (AEM). She
continues to handle most of its administrative work.

She also organizes and does most of the work on the

majority of the projects or activities which the
AEM sponsors.

1-1 continued to report on efforts to establish the |
Latin American Writers’ Community (CLE), including

the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile.
She reported on the steps taken by Mario Honteforte
Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967 9}
Congress in Mexico and on the AEM's probable role in
helping organize that Congress.

L-i supplied information on reactions among the Cen-
tral Americas coumunity in Mexico to the Guatemalan
election campaign and results. i
She maintained contact with and reported on individuals
of interest to the Station, including Monteforte Toledo,

Carlos Pellicer Cimara, Mariuel Germfn Parra, Francisco!

LICOOKY-2 continued to report travel of Communiats ;

or leftists from Central America to Eastern Europe, t

During this period he reported on eight such travelers,

L-1 has been notified that she will be terminated

effective 30 June, She has been given the following

need doing nt AEM to occupy her full-time and there—
fore the inmediate partial withdrawal from AEM work

is @ prerequisite to the accomplishment of these

assignments.
Because L-1 has played such a key role in all AEM

activities, and therefore in determining the direc-

tion and scope of these activities, her sudden with-
Appest eautd veantt fn imnortant changes within AEM. |
Any major change in direction by AEM would probably _
become predictable once the identity of the person :

better than we had expected. 1% is unfortunate that "Janet™

Subject's sanuscript on university refors, which is now in the
bands of someone at ;the UNAM press, This could bea-highly

Ce ET

1. On 7 February LICOOKY-1 told the writer that Estel
Sakolowska, a long-time acquaintance, had told her that she |
is planning a trip to Cuba. Sakolowska is now married to :
Mario Madrigal, a Costa Rican medical doctor who is now in
Cuba. Sakolowska told LICOOKY-1 that she is now in the pro- |
cess of obtaining a (U.S.) passport for her child so that :
they can travel together to Cuba. This is her child's first -
passport. Her explanation for requesting the passport is |
“ for making a trip to Costa Rica. boos bird claims that
the passport appiscaiivs is sow is
"Security Section”. '

2. Sakolowska also told LICOOKY-1 that the "Prensa
Latina Bureau Chief" had proposed to her an apparent intel-
ligence mission to accomplish enroute to Cuba. She believes’ =
this mission is to take piace in Miami, LICOOKY-1 reported :
that on 7 February Sakolowska had a luncheon engagement
with "someone" at the United Nations and speculates it may
be to pick up a package to take to someone in Cuba. LICOOKY-1 '
further speculates that tiis may only be a gift to someone !
in Cuba. : '

3. LICOOKY stated that she had no additional information.
It should be noted, however, that this item was given ina .
: last minute rush just prior to her departure from the writer. 2 - :
j LICOOKY-1 expects to be in New York until the end of February. *

4, LICOOKY-1 states that Sakolowska has been a long-time
“left winger". LICOOKY-1 reported earlier on Sakolowska and -
her connections with revolutionaries in Central America and j
Havana in dispatch HMMA 27924 dated 21 September 1965 pages |
4 and 6, This office is planning no further action on this |
matter and in line with the writer's telephone conversatio:

about ker intended travel to Cuba. According to L-1 the
agents warned Sckelowska that she would be in serious trouble
4f sho attempted such trip. The interview went on about three
hours during which tize L-1 remained im Sckolowska's apartment,
Semetivpes tn the living room and sonetizes in the kitchen
where the interview reportedly was taking place. L-1 atated
that as a result of the warning by the FBI agents Sckolowska
later told L-1 she would not make the trip.

3. Presumably the FBI, if the above etory is accurate, ©
had reasoa for this reported action even though from the y
limited information available, from L-l, there would seem a
possibility of other more profitable courses of actioa.

4. L-1 ststes that Sokolcwska had heard that her
husband, now in Cuba, was living in Sokolowska's house aad
with a nurse to whom he was (engaged). It was partially for
this reagon Sokolovska wished to visit Cuba at this tine.

Jack,

I briete ‘or 30 minutes on LICOOKY
giving his the full background on her ‘io,
education, ClArelationship---from recruit-
ment through current use in Mexico, My
suggestion was that she be told to go to
NY and find a job which would give her a
means of liv2ltihood as well as cover for any
future CIA income. After 6 months (or sone
other specific period cf time) it would be
arranged that either we contact her or she
contact us to determine what her personal
situation was and whether she would then be

in a position to target ag: lected
persons of interest to CIA

be the best approach. He will talk to you
before Friday.

His only question was whether we had any
indication whether she was under develop-
ment by the opposition ---Soviet, Cuban, etc.
I told him that as far as I knew there was

no such 4 I am wrong (per
your and recent activity)
you better correc 3.

| Reference is made to SR TSHR EY SPR S Oihtea states

Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain
independent contractors of this organization to obtain social security
credits by covering such individuals under the social security tax
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also iuclade
@ provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4 and 3-5/8% res, ectively.

Ap a consequence thereoi, said contract is amended dy deieiing
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

ae “Effective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly
. deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same
manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern-
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. Its
implementation does aot imply ir any manner the actual creation of au
' employce-employer relationship. Your legal status under this agree-
tment continues to be that of an independent contractor. °

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an
adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organization. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your
covert deductions returned. :

All other terme and conditions of said contract remain in full force

H and effect. i

1. LICOOZY-1's efforts as described in reterence have
substantial eerit and some potential particularly if the Stat:cn cau
Flea a way to tie them in with the LIRZAM effort in the intellectual
teld.

2, LICOOKY-1 certainly is to be commended for her effort in
getting aritsrs both of the stoke ane tere eneh ae Carlos PELLICER
iaara to. join the AE. rom a KUBARK standpoint the nost interesting
contact is the one with PELLICER because he kas been the reported force
behind the COMES/CLE effort in Hexico.

3. Although her assigned tasks as reported in para 7 a, b and d
og the LILINE mewo do not entail making her witting of other Station i
assets engaged in KHS?AGN Ops among the intellectuals, an amencment if
to her OA is required, and one has been requested. If her efiorts

LILINK wewo) Headquarters should be forwarded your ideas on why and how
LICOOKY-1 should be used as an active MHSPAWN agent, and another
ammendment will be required for this role.

4. AXDRIETTE will discuss this operation with the Station during
his TDY.

5. In view if the restricted OA which confines KUBARK'
association with LICOOKY-1, it is important that Ueacquarters remain
aware of any unusual activity in her personal life which might affect i
her security or the granting of awendments to her OA for individual
operations, Therefore, ve would appreciate your keeping us informed
on @ more timely basis of any undertakings such as the recruitments
