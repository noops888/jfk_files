On February 19, 1958, FRANCES PRIAM, 4310 Vista. View, West
Mifflin, Pa.; advised SA ROBERT A. VOEGE that she is a close
associate of Top Hoodlum JOHN LA ROCCA and MICHAEL GENOVESE,

and is ‘familiar with many of the individuals who meet with

these top hoodlums at the Red Eagle Club, formerly called

the Genovese Cocktail Lounge, 412 Larimer Avenue, Pittsburgh.
PRIAM stated that ARTHUR NELSON has patronized the aforementioned
lounge; and is a close associate of MICHAEL GENOVESE; however, he
has never been permitted to attend meetings of the "Top Men" in
the Pittsburgh rackets when such meetings were held in the lounge.

It. is pointed out that NELSON and MICHAEL GENOVESE have been in
business together, operating Archie's Automatic Car Wash, and
hold property jointly; however, according to PRIAM,. NELSON is
not included in important meetings wherein MIKE GENOVESE is a
participant. é :

on February 24 and 26, 1958, spot physical surveillances were
conducted: on NELSON's residence, 1706 Georgetown Place, and on
his place of business, 8050 Bennett Street, Pittsburgh.

On August. 24, 1957, NELSON's 1958 Ford stationwagon, bearing
Pennsylvania Registration 776207, was seen parked in his drive.
At the same time'a light tan Cadillac, 1956 or 1957 model, pearing
1957 Pennsylvania Tag 3H829, was also parked in NELSON's driveway.
The Pennsylvania Automobile Registration pook shows that Number
3H829 is registered to E. C. WILLIAMS, 1733 South Wyoming Avenue,
Kingston, Pa.

On February 24, 1958, a blue 1956 or 1957 Cadillac with a cream
-colored top bearing 1957 Pennsylvania Tag 135A7, was observed
parked at Archie's Automatic Car Wash. Tag No. 135A7 is registered
to MARY SCOLIERI, 634 Lincoln Avenue, pittsburgh 6, Pa.,

according to:the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Registration book.

On February 26, 1958, at about 2:34 PM, a young unidentified white
male driving a’ black 1957 or 1958 Plymouth, was observed delivering
what. appeared to be three bundles of adding machine tapes to SAM
RUSSO, the manager of the car wash at 8050 Bennett Street. About
ten minutes later another automobile, a Mercury, pearing License
567828, entered the Automatic Car Wash and went through the same
procedures as the preceding car. The 1957 Pennsylvania Motor
Velicle Registration book lists Pennsylvania License 567820 to
