Cuba. The subject of the report, Leonor Ezequiel JIMINEZ-
Valdera, knew Angelo by sight only, since sometime in 1960.
In about 1961 JIMENEZ knew that Angelo was a member of the
G-2, because Angelo rode in the car used by. the G-2 to
apprehend anti-Castro suspects. In November 1961, JIMENEZ
witnessed a trial in Camaguey, Cuba, at which Angelo was
present as the official in charge of the prisoners from
Moron who were on trial. A Cuban national known to

JIMENEZ only as Moralito accompanied Angelo everywhere.
