Cuban leaders are appre-

"aggressive" US policy to-

Intercepted Cuban

military messages revealed that

certain units of the armed

forces were put on defensive

alert immediately after news of

the President's death reached

Cuba.

The alert was maintained

for about three days.

speech on 23 November, which he

termed an "objective analysis"

of the implications of the

assassination,

warned Cubans

that the President's death was

"serious and bad news."

said, turn "a bad

He also asserted that President

Kennedy's alleged promise not

to invade Cuba had been strongly

attacked by those

"ultrareac

who now are

trying to create a

climate of "anti-Soviet and

anti-Cuban hysteria" designed

to pressure the new US Presi

dent toward a Cuban policy

"highly prejudicial to the in-

terests of peace and of man-

Castro stated that he hac

Communist affiliations of the

accused assassin were fabricated

by US "reactionaries" who, he

claimed

were the only people

who could benefit from the Presi-

dent's death.

In this connec-

tion he warned that a "sinister

maneuver" was under way, and

declared "we must be cautious

and vigilant and alert."

warnings in a speech of 24

SOVIET NUCT FAR SUBMARINE PATROLS

On about 16 November a

Soviet E-class nuclear-powered

submarine, equipped with cruise

missiles, completed a 41-day

patrol in the northern Pacific.

This voyage, the first known

out-of-area mission by any of

the USSR's nuclear missile sub-

marines, may presage their regu-

lar use

on patrols in the Atlan

tic and Pacific Oceans.

The first Soviet nuclear

submarine was probably completed

in 1958, and some 30 nuclear-

powered units have since been

placed in service. Until re-

cently, these seldon left home

waters, perhaps with good

reason.

There are numerous

reports of troubles with venti-

lation and propulsion systems.

Since June of this year,

however, there

have been several

longrange nuclear submarine op-

erations, culminating in the

Pacific cruise.

This suggests

that technical problems have

generally been ironed out and

that the submarines, or at least

some of them, now have become

fully operational.

These operations included

a five-week voyage by an E-class

submarine from Vladivostok to

Petropavlovsk in July and August,

which apparently simulated an out-

of-area cruise although the sub-

marine probably never left So-

viet waters. From late July to

early September an unusual de-

ployment of auxiliaries, includ

ing submarine support ships, to

an area near the Canary Islands

may have been in support of a

nuclear submarine mission into

the Atlantic.

There is also some

tenuous evidence that, during the

Same period, Northern

Fleet H-

class and N-Class nuclear subma

rines may have participated in

an interfleet exercise in the

Norwegian Sea and northeast At-

lantic.

In early September an N~

class torpedo-attack submarine

of the Northern Fleet left the

Kola Inlet, transited polar seas,

and arrived at Petropavlovsk

some 15 days later.

Another N

class submarine apparently carried

out a polar operation in late

September and early October which

may have included the circumnavi-

gation of the Spitsbergen Islands.

The Communist World

EASTERN EUROPE PREPARES FOR HARD WINTER

Eastern Europe is making plans

to prevent a recurrence of the

widespread discontent and the se

rious dislocations in some sectors

of the economy which resulted from

last year's severe winter.

The

fuel, power, and construction in-

dustries and the railroads were

the hardest hit, and although a

repetition of last year's weather

conditions would be unusual, it

is primarily in these sectors that

preparations are being made. While

there are signs that the other

Communist regimes are making sim-

ilar plans, the most detailed in

formation is available on East

Germany's preparations.

The East German regime has

already warned that electric pro-

duction capacity again this winter

will be inadequate to meet demands

of all consumers.

The shortfall

results from growing industrial

use of electricity, delays in com-

pletion of new generating capacity,

and the low water level available

for power generation.

The regime

on 30 September published an ur-

gent appeal to save electricity.

It was followed a month later by

announcement of a

for "power thrift."

Throughout

industry power consumption norms

are being established. Production

during night shifts is being in-

creased to make more efficient use

of the hours when power consumption

is normally at a minimum.

In the coal industry, the East

Germans have made an exceptional

effort to increase production and

have succeeded in raising coal re-

serves in industry by 5 percent

since last autumn. Measures also

have been taken to prevent freezing

of coal loaded in open rail cars

and of rail switches at the mines,

which posed major problems last

winter.

The transport of coal

has been given priority over trans-

port of other items on the rail-

road.

East Germany is easing the

burdens on its railroads by con-

tinued transferal of short-distance

hauling from the railroads to

trucks.

New schedules for contin-

uous loading and unloading of

trains and trucks were instituted

on 1 October.

Production in high-fuel-con-

sumption industries such as steel

and ceramics reportedly will be

curtailed or halted as required.

About 60,000 workers would be af

fected by such drastic measures.

Czechoslovakia also has warned

that electric power output will be

insufficient to meet all needs this

winter, largely for the same rea-

sons as in East Germany..

The Czechs

began instituting measures to save

power as early as mid-August, and

preparations at power plants

WEre

to be completed by the end of

October.

Both Poland and Hungary appar-

ently are concerned with ensuring

adequate coal supplies for the do-

mestic market. The chief of Po-

land's coal exporting agency has

said that the country this year

will export to nonbloc countries

one million tons less than last

year. This move, along with greater

coal production, will increase sup-

plies for the domestic market.

Hungary has announced that coal

production will exceed the planned

level by one million tons as a re-

sult of overtime work, and that im-

ports of coal will be

1.2 million

tons above plan. (SECRET KIMBO NO

PEIPING 'S ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH NON-COMMUNIST ASIA

Communist China's economic

activities in the countries of

non-Communist Asia now are re-

covering from the setback they

suffered in 1960 following the

failure of the "leap forward."

Peiping's 1963 trade with

most of these countries appears

to be above last year's, so the

Chinese probably will earn more

from their Asian trade this

year than they have in the re-

cent past..

These earnings will

again be used chiefly to finance

imports of Western grain-which

presumably will

continue at

about last year's level.

China's net export earnings

from trade with Hong Kong,

its

largest

source of free world

currency, are up about 25 per-

cent over 1962 and are running

at an annual rate of about $250

mission.

China's favorable

trade balance with Malaysia may

reach about $80 million this

year

about 10 percent over the

level

achieved last year with

the members of the new federa-

tion.

Sino-Japanese trade is

currently at an annual rate of

slightly over $100 million up

from $84 million last year.

China's economic aid proj-

ects in the non-Communist

East have been implemented

slowly in the last few years.

Such activities are expected to

remain at a moderate level as

long as China's attention is

riveted on earning foreign ex-

change to buy grain.

The Chinese may, however,

be willing to provide additiona

economic assistance to Cambodia

which so far has utilized about

60 percent of a total of $50

million in Chinese grants.

Peiping responded favorably al-

though cautiously to overtures

from Prince Sihanouk after his

announcement of Cambodia's de-

cision to end the US aid progra

Earlier good-will gestures in-

cluded Liu Shao-chi's visit to

bank delegation.

A Chinese delegation this

month arrived in Djakarta to

discuss implementation of a $30-

million credit extended in 1961

for a textile plant. Peiping

recently agreed to provide Cey-

Ion with textile plants and

equipment under their $16-mil-

lion aid pact signed in 1957.

Peiping's largest single

economic aid pact an $84-11-

lion credit extended to Burma

in 1961--has been drawn down

by only about $2 million.

Burma, however, has recently

accepted a Chinese offer to

build two bridges in northern

burma, and there are indications

that formal approval of other

Chinese aid projects will be

forthcoming in the near future.

JAPANESE ELECTION OUTCOME

The Japanese general elec-

tion on 21 November was

charac-

terized by a paucity of real

issues and a low voter turnout.

It brought no significant shift

in the balance between the ruling

Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)

and the leftist opposition.

The LDP won 283 seats. and

is expected to pick up most of

the 12 conservative "independ-

ents." Adherence by all of these

nevertheless would leave the LDP

save cho Loio

still seven seats short of the

position it held after the 1960

elections.

On the left, the important

feature was the failure of the

Japan Socialist Party (JSP) to

gain, while the more moderate

Democratic Socialist Party (DSP)

obtained six more seats than it

won in 1960.

The Japan Connu-

nist Party (JCP) now holds five

seats, a gain of two over its

1960

performance

The voter's support of the

LDP suggests that the electorate

is generally satisfied with con-

ditions and progress under the

Ikeda government.

The LDP's

victory falls short, however,

of assuring Ikeda a third term

as party president or of strength-

ening his position within the

party.

Intensification of

internal rivalries for position

within the party is certain

until precedences among the fac-

tion leaders can be hammered

out.

Actual damage to the

party and to Ikeda's position

nevertheless will probably be

offset by the fact that the lost

seats for the most part went

to the DSP, while the JSP, the

real enemy, was defeated.

A period of critical self

examination and possible changes

of leadership clearly are in

store for the JSP.

Its net

loss of one seat in the face

of gains by its DSP and CP

ravass may have seriously

damaged its carefully self-con

trived image as the leftist

"wave of the future," destined

to control the government by

1970.

Loss of extreme left

wing support to the JCP may be

attributed to the confrontation

of the JSP and JCP over the nu-

clear test ban treaty and to

the JCP's pro-Chinese stand.

The JSP's failure to reform

internally may have influenced

some voters to shift to the DSP.

HIGH LEVEL CF VIET CONG ACTIVITY IN SCUTH VIETNAM

Cormunist military activity

in

South Vietnan has continued

at an unusually high tempo in the

three weeks since the coup

in

Saigon.

Despite some slackening

of the pace, the greater effec-

tiveness of the attacks and their

spread to new areas will increase

pressure on the country's new

military rulers to produce some

dramatic achievement to sustain

the psychological lift generated

by their takeover.

In the week ending 18

November, Viet Cong attacks

dropped to 14y trom the previous

week's all-time hich of 233, but

were still 50 percent above

the

average level set over the past

year.

A number of actions on

24 November emphasized the

boldness of the Viet Cong

offensive. A battalion-size

attack overran a Special Forces

training camp about 25 miles

north of Saigon, causing heavy

losses among both government

troops and US advisers.

Ground

fire damaged several government

aircraft operating in the south-

ernmost provinces.

Near the

Iaotian border in the central

highlands province of Kontum,

two strategic hamlets were

attacked.

In the delta, along the

area of the heaviest Communist

activity, a recent concentra

tion of attacks in Dinh Tuong

Province, just southwest of

Saigon, and to a lesser extent

in its

northern neighbors Long

An and Hau Nghia, has suggested

a possihle effort to secure a

corridor between the Communist

war zone adjacent to Cambodia

in Tay Ninh Province, and

strongholds farther south in

the delta.

The Kontum

attacks, however, suggest a

step-up

may now

be under way

in northern South Vietnam.

A heavy volume of communications

traffic was directed to this

general area by North Vietnam's

military high command from 15

November through at least 21

November.

South Vietnam's military

leaders are aware of the need

to move rapidly in pressing

the war against the Viet Cong®

They are continuing to try to

strengthen intelligence functions,

and reportedly plan to reshuffle

commanders in the I and II Corps

SYRIAN AND IRAQI REGIMES TRYING TO STABILIZE

The stability of the re

gimes in Iraq and Syria is still

uncertain in the wake of the

army coup in Iraq.

This in turn

leaves unsettled the status of

future relationships between

these two countries as well as

between them and Egypt.

In Iraq, two ministers have

threatened to resign unless the

new government adopts a firm

stand regarding union with Egypt,

according to an intercepted

Egyptian message from Baghdad.

Also unhappy are a number of

non-Baathist army officers

who oppose the retention of

several Baathists in the cabi

net, and President Arif may

have some difficulty in holding

together the disparate army ele

split between moderates

who want to broaden the regime's

statements made by Premier Hafiz

since he returned from Baghdad

Twhere he was caught at the out-

break of the coup) are concilia-

tory to non-Baathist elements

and reflect his personal opin-

ions rather than party decisions.

This dissension within the Baath

may affect the government's

ability to protect itself against

anti-Baath coup plotters who

have been heartened by events

in Iraq.

In an effort to moderate

the initially violent Syrian

reaction against the coup in

Baghdad, Hafiz had in fact en-

dorsed the Iraqi Army's move

against the national guard,

the

Iraqi Baath Party's paramili-

tary arm.

He also praised Presi-

dent Arif as a "brave Arab sol-

dier': and claimed that the coup

was staged by "Baathist ele-

ments."

The Iraqi regime for

its part has proclaimed that

military union with Syria re-

mains in force and that a new

conmander of the joint armies

will be announced shortly.

Syrian troops fighting in north-

ern Iraq will evidently remain

there, but a small Syrian unit

stationed near Baghdad is being

withdrawn.

The Syrians have also

agreed to expel Iragi Baathist

extremist Ali Saleh Saadi after

a message from Iraq protested

that his presence in Damascus

violated an agreement presum

ably made by the new Iragi

leaders with Hafiz and other

Syrian Baathists.

Saadi had

arrived in Syria unannounced

following a short exile in

Madrid.

CONGOLESE EXPEL SOVIET DIPLOMATS

Congolese Premier Adoula

last week declared all Soviet Ei

bassy personnel in Leopoldville

persona non grata.

Adoula's move

followed the arrest on 19 Novem

ber of two Soviet diplomats found

carrying documents showing the So

viets to be giving financial as-

sistance and encouragement to a

group of radical anti-Adoula

exiles across the Congo River in

Brazzaville. All of the Soviet

staff reportedly had departed by

23 November®.

The premier charged that the

captured documents proved "unques-

tionably" the collusion of the So-

viet Embassy with the leftist "con-

mittee of national liberation" in

Brazzaville.

He did not however,

break diplomatic relations with

the Soviet Union and has stated

that he will consider the appoint

ment of a new ambassador. Although

Moscow has bitterly protested the

expulsion of its officials, it has

indicated an intention to replace

them rather than retaliate against

the Congo.

No action has been taken

against the Leopoldville missions

of three other Soviet bloc coun

tries-Czechoslovakia, Poland, and

Bulgaria.

Adoula earlier planned

to expel

both the Soviet and Czech

missions, and for at least a month

the Congolese have been debating

some action to curb antigovernment

activitles by all the Soviet bloc

missions.

Soviet bloc representa-

tives have long been in contact

with dissident Congolese groups,

and their activity appears to re

flect routine clandestine contacts

and financial aid rather than So-

viet backing of any imminent coup

attempt.

The Congolese exiles in Braz

zaville consist of perhaps 50 anti

Adoula politicians and soldiers,

adherents of the imprisoned Antoine

Gizenga and the late Premier Patrice

Lumumba. They fled to Brazzaville

following Adoula's closing of parlia-

ment in late September.

Led by for-

mer Lumumbist Vice Premier Chris

tophe Gbenye, they have been able to

operate fairly freely in the Brazza

ville Congo's present confused at

mosphere under the shaky provisional

regime of Massamba-Debat.

They have

declared themselves a "committee of

national liberation" for the Leopold

ville Congo and are trying to convey

the impression that they constitute

a "government-in-exile."

The captured documents reveal

considerable infighting and confusion

on tactics within the group.

The

exiles nevertheless have been press-

ing for foreign support, arms, and

funds, are trying to establish an or-

ganization inside the Leopoldville

Congo, and hope to subvert its army.

They reportedly plan also to try to

assassinate leaders of its govern

ment.

Their successes and capabili-

ties presently seem limited, but

their activities may well lead to

further friction between the Leo-

poldville and Brazzaville regimes.

Katanga's ex-President Tshombé,

still in exile in Barcelona, has

again appealed to Adoula to permit

him to return soon to the Congo. The

Leopoldville

government apparently

still opposes Ishombé's return, and

his bid for a high government post

has been rejected.

Tshombé's recent promise to col-

laborate with the Leopoldville gov

ernment in the 1964 parliamentary

elections appears to be having some

appeal, however.

Tshombe says he

has decided to return soon, but has

indicated he will await assurances

for his personal safety from the

central government.

MALAISE IN MALI

Mali's leftist government

is facing increasingly urgent

economic and political problems

at a time when President Modibo

Keita's efforts to mediate the

Moroccan Algerian dispute have

raised his standing to a new high

elsewhere in Africa. In the

face of mounting criticism from

politicians with strong local

power bases

and from young gov

ernment functionaries,

Keita

1s devoting major attention to

defending his party's hegemony.

He must also contend with dissi

dence among nomadic tribesmen

and with a desperate foreign ex-

change shortage.

The key problem probably

is that of foreign exchange.

The government brought most of

its troubles on itself a year

and a halt ago when,

of excessive Marzist-flavored

anticolonialism, it in effect

cut itself off from automatic

access to the French foreign

exchange reserves and set up a

Malian currency.

Since then a

steady adverse trade

balance

has cut into the country's own

meager reserves, and

by mid-

November they had fallen to an

estimated $1 million.

The gov-

ernment's budget deficit is

running about $14 million an

vally.

France reluctantly

bailed the Malians out once be

fore with a stopgap dole, but

it may be unwilling to do so

again.

The bloc has consistent

ly refused to extend budgetary

issistance, although it has pro

ridd development credits

amounting to $67.5 million.

Doctrinaire rigidity has

helped to make

ineffective the

government's efforts to alleviate

this situation.

Whereas Guinea's

Sekou Touré has recently retreated

from "African socialism' when

laced with an even worse situa

tion, Keita and his associates

have been reluctant

to curtail

the activities of such consistent.

money-losers as the state trading

company and the state airline.

This evidence of ineffective-

ness has brought to the surface

dissatisfaction among local pol-

iticians whom Keita has never

succeeded in bringing under

close control of his Soudanese

Union Party.

These local figures,

who generally occupy the conserv-

ative

end of the spectrum, seem

to control the National Assembly.

They also have at least some in-

fluential spokesmen both in the

party's political bureau and in

the executive branch of the gov

ernment, especially among elements

desiring a pragmatic approach to

Mali's problems.

at the same time, Keita

is faced with active

defiance

of the regime's authority on the

part of Tuareg nomads in the

country's northern deserts.

Half of the army reportedly

now is deployed in an effort,

so far unsuccessful, to halt

raids by these tribesmen. Keita

himself has spent most of this

month in outlying areas, trying

to re-establish party control

over potential and actual

centers of dissidence. (CON

THE DE GAULLE - ERHARD TALKS

The 21-22 November talks

between Charles de Gaulle and

Ludwig Erhad seem to have estab-

lished a good working relation

ship and clarified aspects of

France's and West Germany's

national policies, but produced

few decisions.

De Gaulle reportedly en-

couraged Erhard to take some

initiative toward a politically

united Europe, and Erhard re-

sponded that he would give the

matter sympathetic consideration.

In his public statements, how-

ever, Erhard again made it plain

that he favored a Europe rooted

in an Atlantic community rather

than the French-led third force

which De Gaulle envisages.

German chancellor and

veteran French chief of state

"agreed to disagree."

De Gaulle

reportedly lectured

Erhard on the

Gaullist view that France cannot

depend on the US but rather needs

its own nuclear force, while

Irhard publicly reartirmed

Germany's trust in the protec

tive shield of US military power.

Neither leader disparaged the

other's position, however, and

De Gaulle is said to have assured

Erhard that France has no inten-

tion of forcing Bonn to choose

between Paris and Washington.

On the divisive and po

litically treacherous issue of

agricultural integration in the

Common Market, some slight

progress was made.

Neither

leader appeared prepared as

yet

to accept the Mansholt plan

whereby a single community

grain price would be set between

the high German level and the

lower French level, but, accord-

ing to a German observer, they

agreed that the proposal offered

a good working basis.

Implicit

l atmosphere was

the suggestion that De Gaulle

now is willing to discuss the

grain issue beyond the year-

end deadline he had previously

set for final agreement on

EEC agricultural policy.

It was agreed, moreover,

that EEC arrangements for beef,

dairy products, and rice-be

completed by the end of December.

In addition, the communiqué

issued

at the close of the

talks looked forward to the

successful conclusion of the

negotiations envisaged by the

US Trade Expansion Act.

Erhard and De Gaulle

throughout the talks apparently

maintained an air of cordiality,

but Erhard demonstrated that he

was neither so innately sympa

thetic to De Gaulle's views as

was Konrad Adenauer nor so

willing to play a secondary

role.

Thus Erhard may have

served notice that a somewhat

sterner era for Franco-German

relationships has arrived.

WESTERN EUROPE'S STEEL PROBLEM

The Council of the European

Coal-Steel Community (CSC) is

meeting on 2 December to deal

with the problems that afflict

the continental steel industry.

The session promises to have

far-reaching implications for

the CSC's future as well as for

in recent months, suffered from

reductions in price that have

taken place both inside and out

side the community.

During the

past year, CSC officials have

advanced several possible solu

tions to the problem-including

the promotion of both official

or private agreements with for-

eign producers to limit their

exports--but none of these has

proved effective.

More recently, the CSC has

increasingly attracted to

the idea of raising tariffs,

but so far has not received

solid backing from the member

states for such a move.

The

Council has also been put on

notice by the US that a tariff

hike on an item so important

as steel would have grave polit

quences on the forthcoming

tariff negotiations.

will support a tariff rise

that was proposed by Bonn three

months ago.

If Paris and Bonn

see eye to eye on this, it is

probable that their tariffs will

go up to 9 percent-the pres-

ent level in Italy.

A restric-

tion on trade would primarily

affect Japan, Austria, and the

strict quotas on imports from

the bloc.

The political importance

of the steel tariff question

to the CSC has been generally

recognized in the community.

President Del Bo has intimated

to US officials that unless

the CSC can produce a Community-

wide solution to the challenge,

the CSC's very existence will

be threatened.

Recently published

statements by President Goulart

have added to the widespread

un-

speculation that he is planning

to establish an authoritarian

regime.

In an interview with

the Brazilian weekly Manchete,

published on 20 November, Gou-

tion will push the country "in-

evitably to bankruptcy" and a

"social disaster of catastrophic

proportions."

He emphasized his

lack of presidential powers to

solve the present crisis.

Goulart's words have aroused

sharp criticism from reponsible

political leaders and influential

newspapers.

Ranieri Mazzilli,

president

of the Chamber of Dep-

uties and next in line for the

presidency, expressed his sus-

picion of

Goulart's motives to

Ambassador Gordon and stated

that Brazilian democracy is ex

periencing its "gravest testing

time" since

• the 1946 Constitution

was adopted. The US Army attaché

reports a growing concern among

army officers that Goulart may

attempt some extreme action during

the next few weeks.

The additional unrest

provoked by the President's

comments has encouraged re

newed plotting by rightist

elements, such as the Marshal

Odylio Denys group.

It has

also increased the chances of

an illegal action by the op-
