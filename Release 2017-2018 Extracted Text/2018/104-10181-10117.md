MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible DRE Animus Towards President Kennedy

1. Thia memorandum makes record of a recollection

which has been brought to mind in recent weeks since my return

from Yugoslavia in late November 1966.

I, upon returning from Berlin I wa

signed Son, ye on returned one in wed fron

then until shortly before my reassignment to Headquarters in

late summer 1963 concerned funding of overseas elements of

the DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate) which had its main

office in Miami (the case officer for this group during this

period was Mr. Ross CROZIER, since resigned).

3. I believe that it is this group, the DRE, which has been

referred to in investigations into the President's asgaggination

as the Cuban Student Directorate, whose New Orleans represen-

tative is said to have had contacts with OSWALD.

4. I have assumed that, since the time I was transferred

from Miami and scheduled for my next assignment as COB,J 27

officers better and more recently informed than myself

have probably examined in detail all aspects of the DRE involve-

ment with OSWALD, in order to rule out any slight possibility

that compromise of the ClA sponsorship uf this organization

might in any way embarrass the Agency. Recent news reports of

investigations centering in New Orleans on the assassination have

once again brought to mind the concern I felt in November 1963,

by which time, however, I was far removed from current knowledge

of the operation.

5. I do retain a distinct recollection that the DRE leader-

ship, specifically Luis FERNANDEZ Rocha, whom I met several

times, did hold sentiments of chagrin and embitterment that

President Keanedy had not more forcefully pursued a "liberation"

of Cuba. Whether or not this animus, which could be discerned

as occasional signs of anger or of contempt or of discouragement,

might have been translated into a wish for revenge, may be better

known to other officers who dealt with this group after the summer

of 1963.
