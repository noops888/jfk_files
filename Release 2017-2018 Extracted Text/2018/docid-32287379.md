location of GEORGE

ALBERT MC GANN.

ADMINISTRATIVE

On December 30, 1967, PCI R. L.. HANCOCK

Po contacted him concerning

GEORGE ALBERT MC GANN and he got in touch with

MC GANN who then turned himself in to the Dallas PD

and was released on bond.

MC GANN was charged with

the murder of TRUMAN CARTER in Dallas, July, 1967.

HANCOCK believes this was done by Captain WILL FRITZ

merely to make good on a boast he had previously

made that he would have someone arrested for this

murder before the end of the year 1967.

HANCOCK

does not feel that MC GANN will be indicted for

this murder and no date was set for a hearing.

On 1/22/68, PCI HANCOCK was advised that

MC GANN was a suspect in a recent Dallas major

theft of color television sets DL 15-6383) •

HANCOCK

stated he had heard nothing about color televisions

from MC GANN and MC GANN had called him 1/12/68,

stating he would be out of town for a few days, but

did not say where he would be.

On 2/13/68, PCI HANCOCK was informed

that a Federal warrant is on file for MC GANN and

MC GANN is a fugitive. HANCOCK stated he does

not know where MC GANN is, but is quite certain

He stated MC GANN and his

visit his mother in Big Spring, Texas, from time

to time.
