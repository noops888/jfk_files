DALLAS
AT DALLAS, TEXAS, Will recontact PCI

R. L, HANCOCK to determine location of GEORGE

ALBERT MC GANN,
ADMINISTRATIVE

On December 30, 1967, PCI R. L. HANCOCK
advised that the Dallas PDR contacted him concerning
GEORGE ALBERT MC GANN and he got in touch with
MC GANN who then turned himself in to the Dallas PD
and was released on bond, MC GANN was charged with
the murder of TRUMAN CARTER in Dallas, July, 1967,
HANCOCK believes this was done by Captain WILL FRITZ
merely to make good on a boast he had previously
made that he would have someone arrested for this
murder befote the end of the year 1967. HANCOCK
does not feel that MC GANN will be indicted for
this murder and no date was set for a hearing.

On 1/22/68, PCI HANCOCK was advised that
MC GANN was a suspect in a recent Dallas major
theft of color television sets (DL 15-6383), HANCOCK
stated he had heard nothing about color televisions
from MC GANN and MC GANN had called him 1/12/68,
stating he would be out of town for a few days, but
did not say where he would be.

On 2/13/68, PCI HANCOCK was informed

that a Federal warrant is on file for MC GANN and

MC GANN is a fugitive. HANCOCK stated he does
not know where MC GANN is, but is quite certain
he is out of Dallas, He stated MC GANN and his
wife are together and he has known MC GANN to
visit his mother in Big Spring, Texas, from time
to time.
