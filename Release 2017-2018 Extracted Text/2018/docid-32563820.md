TAYLOR JACKSON SIMS, III

SPECIAL AGENT

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

SAVANNAH DIVISION:

Can testify that THOMAS HARVEY HERMAN gave the following

signed statement to him on March 29, 1944 at the Naval Receiving Barracks,

Savannah, Georgia:

"Savannah, Ga.

March 29, 1944

I, Thomas Harvey Herman, make the following voluntary

statement of my own free will to Taylor J. Sims, III. who

has identified, himself to me as a Special Agent of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation.

No threats or promises

were made to me to

give this statement and I know it may

be used in court.

I was born June 24, 1927 at Atlantic City, N. J. where I

lived and went to school up until two years ago.

went to Key West, Fla. with mother where I lived at 586 S. W.A.

St., and my address in Atlantic City before this was 216 s.

Arkansas Ave. Ily mother died last Narch and I went to Atlantic

City and stayed with Harold Maxwell, 315 Washington Ave.

:In

June of 1943 I went to Philadelphia and signed with the U. S.

Merchant Marine at their office on Chestnut St. and shipped

out from New York on the W. W. Mills, a ship owned by the Pure

Oil Co.

This ship is old and travels up and down the eastern

coast of the U.S. It is a tanker.

On Mar. O, 1944 the ship docked at New York, and Capt.

Haynes Maxwell gave me and Jack Dale Williams permission to

leave ship and return to New York in about 45 days.

We did

not have to tell him where we were going.

We left New York

and got to washington about the loth, and I bought the Navy

uniform which I am now wearing at a tailor shop specializing

in uniforms and having a sign in front "servicemen's equipment".

I don't remember just where this was located. Jack Dale

williams had previously bought his navy uniform at Galveston,

Texas, and he knew it was wrong to wear it because I told him

that he couldn't wear the service stripes which he has on his

sLeeve.

We left Washington on March 16 and arrived in Savannah

by hitch-hiking early Sunday morning, the 26th.

Williams and

I registered at the US here at which time we both were wearing

our navy uniforms. However, we told them we were in the Merchant

Marine.

Williams

and I wore the uniform from Washington to

Savannah, and we have worn them most of the time here in

I knew when I bought the uniform and when I have been

wearing it that it was wrong and that I wasnot entitled to

Last night Williams and I spent all our money, I having had

$200 when I started out, and we were going to hitch hike back to

New York this morning when we were picked up by the M. P.s.

Last night we slept in a man's car with his permission, but I

don't remember who he was

or where he lived.

I do not have a Selective Service registration or classification

card because I never registered since I was too young. I don't

have any Navy identification papers, nor do I have with me my

Merchant Marine papers which I left on the ship. I of course

could not present any of these papers to Mr. Sims when he asked

me for them.

I told the Navy Officers this morning first that I was in

the Navy and second that I was in the Navy armed guard, but

these stories were not true. I have never been arrested before.

During the course of the interview, Subject HERMAN

advised that he was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey and that he has

spent most of his life in such city. He stated that he has a birth

certificate on record in Atlantic City and that at one time he had a

certified copy of such record which he lost a short time ago.

He stated

that both his father and mother are dead and that following the death of

his mother in March 1943, he left Key West, Florida where they had been

living for a short time and returned to Atlantic City. There he resided

with HAROLD MAXWELL, 315 Washington Avenue, for some time and it was

MAXWELI who interested him in signing up with the Merchant Marine•

MAXWELL is the nephew of the Captain of the steamship on which subject

HERNAN stated that he had been working HERMAN also said that at the

time he signed up for the Merchant Marine he was not fingerprinted. He

advised that the boat, S. So Mills, a tanker, is possibly filling up at

New York.

He denied having any previous arrest record and was unable

to present any card of identification.

He could not present any Selective

Service card in view of the fact as stated by him that he has not registered

since he is not yet eighteen years old. He advised that the Captain of

the boat permitted him and subject to leave their papers on the boat and

that it was through Captain MAXWELL that they were able to leave the boat

and dock without having to show such papers. When questioned as to reason

that he wore the Navy uniform, HERMAN stated that he had no particular

reason, but just bought it and wore it.

Herman bought his

uniform in Washington and I bought two service stripes and had

them put on my sleeves.

I have worn the uniform on the trip

down to Savannah and while I have been here since Sunday. I

know that I am not entitled to wear this Navy uniform. Last

During the course of the interview with WILLIAMS,

the advised that he has spent a large portion of his life in Key West,

Florida, and that he has a birth certificate on record there showing

his birthdate to be July 5, 1925. WILLIAMS was unable to present any

identification papers and stated that he knew that he was supposed to

register for Selective Service when he became eighteen years old but

advised that he had been too busy to do so.

He denied having any previous

criminal record and did not give any plausible reason for the wearing of

the United. States

Navy uniform other than that he just wanted to buy it

and wear it. He said that he purchased the uniform at Watertown, Texas,

a small town not far from Galveston. He admitted having told the Naval

officers who questioned him when he was first apprehended that he had told

them that he was in the Navy but that he had later admitted that this

was not true.

Both subjects were thoroughly questioned as to

whether they had obtained anything of value as a result of reporting

themselves to be members of the United States Navy.

They both denied

having received anything of value other than" admitting that while

wearing their uniforms, they had received courtesies from civilians,

as automobile rides. They stated that upon registering at the

U.S.O, in Savannah when they spent the night at such place,:

that they

merely requested a room for the night but that at such time they were

wearing the uniform.

Original copies of the above signed statements are

being retained in the files of the Savannah Field Division. The service

stripes worn by subject WILLIAMS at the time of apprehension are also

being retained in the files of the Savannah Office.

PROSECUTIVE STEPS

The facts in the instant case were presented telephonically

to Assistant United States Attorney JULIAN HARIRIDGE, who authorized the filing

of a complaint against

both subjects for illegal wearing of the uniform.

On March 30, 1944, complaints were filed before United

States Commissioner PERRY BRANNEN and warrants, were issued against the subject

for violation of Section 1393, Title 10, United States Code, in that they

wore uniforms of the United States Navy when they were not members of the

Navy and were therefore not entitled to, wear them.

On the same day hearing was held before Commissioner

BRANNEN at which time probable cause was found and subject HERMAN was

placed under $500 bond

on charge of illegal wearing of the uniform and

WILLIANS was placed under $1000 bond on charges of illegal wearing of

the uniform and failure to register for Selective Service.

At the present

date neither of the subjects have made such bond.
