FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
SAVANNAH DIVISION:

Can testify that THOMAS HARVEY HERMAN gave the fottowing
as statement to him on March 29, 19) at the Naval Receiving Barracks,
Savannah, Georgia: ff

"Savannah, Gae
March 29, 19h

I, Thomas Harvey Herman, make the following voluntary
statement of my own free will to Taylor J. Sims, III. who
has identified himself to me as a Special Agent of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, No threats or promises ]
were made to me to give this statement and I know it may
be used in courte

I was born June 2h, 1927 at Atlantic City, N. J. where I

lived and went to school up until two years ago. Then I 1 i
» went to Key West, Fla. with mother where I lived at 586-S. WA.

St., and my address in Atlantic City before this was 216 S.

Arkansas Ave. lily mother died last March and I went to Atlantic

City and stayed with Harold Maxwell, 315 Washington Ave. In

June of 1913 I went to Philadelphia and signed with the U. Ss.

Merchant Marine at their office on Chestnut St. and shipped

out from New York on the W. W. Mills, a ship owned by the Pure

Oil Co. This ship is old and travels up and down the eastern (

coast of the U.S. It is a tanker. !

On Mar. 8, 19h the ship docked at New York, and Capt.
Haynes Maxwell gave me and Jack Dale Williams permission to
leave ship and return to New York in about 15 days. We did
not have to tell him.where we were going. We Left New York

and got to Washington about the 10th, and I bought the Navy
uniform which I am now wearing at a tailor shop specializing

in uniforms and having a sign in front "servicemen's equipment",
I don't remember just where this was located. Jack Dale
Williams had previously bought his navy uniform at Galveston,
Texas, and he knew it was wrong to wear it because I told him
that he couldn't wear the service stripes which he has on his
sleeve.

We left Washington on March 16 and arrived in Savannah
by hitch-hiking early Sunday morning, the 26th. Williams and
I registered at the USO here at which time we both were wearing .
our navy uniforms. However, we told them we were in the Merchant
Marine. Williams and I wore the uniform from Washington to
Savannah, and we have worn them most of the time here in
Savannah. I knew when I bought the uniform and when I have been
wearing it that it was wrong and that I wasnot entitled to
wear it. : ’

Last night Williams and I spent all our money, I having had
$200 when I started out, and we were going to hitch hike back to
New York this morning when we were picked up by the M. P.s.

Last night we slept in a man's car with his permission, but I
don't remember who he was or where he lived.

. I do not have a Selective Service registration or classification
card because I never registered since I was too young. I don't
have any Nayy identification papers, nor do I have with me my
Merchant Marine papers which'I left on the ship. I of course

could not present any of these papers to Mr. Sims when he asked

me for them.

I told the Navy Officers this morning first that I wes in
the Navy and second that I was in the Navy armed guard, but
these stories were not true. I have never been arrested before.

best of my knowledge.

During the course of the interview, Subject HERMAN
advised that he was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey.and that he has
spent most of his life in such city. He stated that he has a birth
certificate on record in Atlantic City and that at one time he had a
certified copy of such record which he lost a. short time ago. He stated
that both his father and mother are dead and that following the death of
his mother in March 1943, he left Key West, Florida where they had been
living’ for a short time and returned to Atlantic City. There he resided
with HAROLD MAXWELL, 315 Washington Avenue, for some time and it was
MAXWELL who interested him in-signing up with the Merchant Marine. HAROLD
MAXWELL is the nephew of the Captain of the steamship on which subject
HERMAN stated that he had been working. HERMAN also said that at the
time he signed up for the Merchant Marine he was not fingerprinted. He
advised that the boat, S. S. Millis, a tanker, is possibly filling up at
New York. He denied having any previous arrest record and was unable
to present any card of identification. He could not present any Selective
Service card in view of the fact as stated by him that he has not registered
since he is not yet eighteen years old. He advised that the Captain of
the boat permitted him and subject to leave their papers on the boat and
that it was through Captain MAXWELL that they were able to leave the boat
and dock without having to show such papers. When questioned as to reason
that he wore the Navy uniform, HERMAN stated that he had no particular
reason, but just bought it and wore it.

Special Agent SIMS can also testify that on March 29,
19h JACK DALE WILLIAMS gave the following signed statement in the Naval
Receiving Barracks:

"savannah, Gae
March 29, 19h

I, Jack Dale Williams, make the following voluntary statement.
to Taylor J. Sims, III. who. has identified himself to me as A
Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. No threats
or promises were made to me to give this statement, and I know
it may be used in court.

I was born July 5, 1925 at Key West, Florida, and I am now
18 years old. I have lived in Key West about all my life with
my parents Mr. and Mrs. Jack Dale Williams, that is until my
father died. My mother has since remarried and her name now -
is Mrs. P. R. Engold, and lived on Northwest E. St.

About two years ago I enlisted in the Merchamt Marine at
their office on Park Ave. in New York City. Sincethen T have
served on two boats, the S. S. Malcolm and the’
About the 6th of March the S. S. Millis dockeg An\lew York,

Watertown, Tex. just outside of Galveston, and I wore tiis
uniform down from New York to Washington. Herman bought his
uniform in Washington and I bought two service stripes and had
them put on my sleeves. I have worn the uniform on the trip
down to Savannah and while I have been here since Sunday. I
know that I am not entitled to wear this Navy uniform. Last’
night we lost out caps at the USO where we have been staying.
We got plenty of rides by telling people we were in the Navy
at the same time we had out uniforms on, but I have never
received money by telling people I was in the navy.

I-am 18 years old and I know that I should have registered
for the Selective Service when I became 18, but I have not so
registered, I did not present Mir. Sims with a Selective S,rvice
registration or classification card because of course I don't
have any. Nor do I have my Merchant Seaman papers which are
on the S. S. Mills. I intended wearing the uniform I have on
now when I left the S. S. ifills in New York.

pe During the course of the interview with WILLIAMS,
he advised that he has spent a large portion of his life in Key West,
Florida, and that he has a birth certificate on record there showing
his birthdate to be July 5, 1925. WILLIAMS was unable to present any
K identification papers and stated that he knew that he was supposed to
‘¥ register for Selective Service when he became eighteen years old but
advised that he had been too busy to do so. He denied having any previous
criminal record and did not give any plausible reason for the wearing of
the United States Navy uniform other than that he just wanted to buy it
and wear it. He said that he purchased the uniform at Watertown, Texas,
a small town not far from Galveston. He admitted having told the Naval
officers who questioned him when he was first apprehended that he had told
them that he was in the Navy but that he had later admitted that this
was not true. .

Both subjects were thoroughly questioned as to’
whether they had. obtained anything of value as a result of reporting
themselves to be members of the United States Navy. They both denied
having received anything of value other than’ admitting that while
wearing their uniforms, they had received courtesies from civilians,
such as automobile rides. ‘They stated that upon registering at the
U.S.O. in Savannah when they spent the night at such place,. that they
merely requested a room for the night but that at such time they were
wearing the uniform.

Original copies of the above signed statements are
being retained in the files of the Savannah Field Division. The service
stripes worn by. subject WILLIAMS at the time of apprehension are also

being retained in the files of the Savannah Office.

PROSECUTIVE STEPS

The facts in the instant case were presented telephonically
to Assistant’ United States Attorney JULIAN HARTRIDGE, who authorized the filing '
of a complaint against both subjects for illegal wearing of the uniforms

On March 30, 1944, complaints were filed before United
States Commissioner PERRY BRANNEN and warrants were issued against the subject
for violation of Section 1393, Title 10, United States Code, in that they
. wore uniforms of the United States Navy when they were not menbers of the
Navy and were therefore not entitled toywear them.

On the same day hearing was held before Commissioner
BRANNEN at which time probable cause was found and subject HERMAN was
placed under $500 bond on charge of illegal wearing of the uniform and
WILLIAMS was placed under $1000 bond on charges of illegal wearing of
the uniform and failure to register for Selective Service. At the present
date neither of the subjects have made such bond.

UNDEVELOPED LEADS:

THE NEW YORK FIELD DIVISION, at New York City, will

THE NEWARK FIELD DIVISION, at Atlantic City, New
Jersey, will check the records of the Bureau of Vital Statistics in
order to verify the birthdate of subject THOMAS HARVEY HERMAN.
