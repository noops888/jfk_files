This memorandum advises of demonstrations being scheduled in

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition was formed at a
conference held at Columbia University, New York City, in July, 1971, which
was attended by approximately 1,000 women from 29 states. The conference
voted to make a woman's right to abortion a national and political issue,
Subsequent to Sits formation, the coalition called for demonstrations in !
San Francisco and Washington on 11/20/71 to build public support for the Z,
repeal of all antiabortion laws, to protest forced sterilization, andtocall ~ ‘A
for an end to restrictive contraceptive laws. A source of the Washington ~
Field Office has advised that the march in Washington is supported by the

: Young Socialist Alliance, the youth group of the Socialist Workers Party AC)
(SWP). CaroJ//Lipman, who is a member of the SWP, is Project Director ~
of the Washington march,

Coalition leaders in deneieetne permit for the demonstration have
jestimated that participation in the Washington march will range between
410,000 and 20,000 persons. The Washington Field Office has developed
information that 46 buses have been chartered to bring participants to the
demonstration. Participants will represent some 80 cities. The Metropolitan
Police Department anticipates participation will be in the vicinity of 3, 5. 2.900 persons

ac aerate bf sf Me nies Socal c & plenklear

we = ee 4y
We have included all pertinent information ¢ concerning this
march in our summary teletype to The White House, the Vice President,

Secret Service, the Attorney General, and military intelligence agencies.

There have been no traffic restrictions placed in effect
by the Metropolitan Police Department to date. However, this would be
a later consideration as the date of the march approaches.

It appears that the route of march will definitely affect
/ traffic on Saturday morning.

as being formed by the national conference of
more than 1,000 women held in New Yo: City,
New York, in July 1971. % that conference,
women from 29 states and 253 organizations came
together to unite their efforts in the national
fight for the repeal of all abortion laws and
for the corollary demands of no forced sterilization
and repeal of contraception laws. The conference

z| called for a massive show of force for these goals
in a march on Washington, D.C., and San Francisco,
California, November 20, 1971. WOWAAC is based
on a program of legislative, judicial, and
mass demonstration activities on a local and. .
national level, and seeks to unite all women in
the fignt for the right of abortion.

The September 22, 1971,
a newspaper of general circulation
California, contains an article on
Washington, D. C., entitled “Abortion Mar

"Women from 253 organizations across the country
are mobilizing for mass demonstrations here
(Washington, D. C.) and in San Francisco in

RE: WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE OF MARYLAND
INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

(TROTSKYIST )
e On November 13, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's National Abortion Coalition (WONAAC) planned to

hold demonstrations at Washington; D. C. and San Francisco,
California on November 20, 1971. The purpose of the ,
demonstrations were to call for the repeal of all abortion,
contraception and forced sterilization laws. Thé"Women's
Right to Choose of Maryland, the Baltimore, Maryland
affiliate of WONAAC was to organize busing and housing
arrangements for out-of-state women.

On November 22, 1971, a source advised that the
Women's Right to Choose of Maryland, working from 3028
Greenmout Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, were unsuccessful
in attempts to generate enthusiasm for the WONNAC demonstration
among Baltimore area women. Therefore, the plan to charter
a bus for the purpose of transporting demonstrators to the
Washington, D. C, rally was cancelled.

On November 30, 1971, a second source advised
that the Women's Right to Choose of Mexyland had been
formed as an “ad hoc" group for the specific purpose of
supporting the Novenber 20, 1971 Washington, D. C. demonstra-
tion. The source furtner staved tnact the Women's Right ‘
to Choose of Maryland ceased to exist, following this i
demonstration, and is now defunct. j

February 11 - 13, 1972

Boston, Massachusetts
| On February 18, 1972, source, who has furnished
! reliable information in the past, furnished the following
H
i information;
} A Women's National Abortion Action Coalition
} (WONAAC) Convention was held on the Boston University campus,
3 Boston, Massachusetts, during the period of February 11 -
i 13, 1972.
} .
a Approximately 1,000 persons were in attendance
id at this convention which was held to determine future action
; of WONAAC and to allow diverse factions within the Women's
i Abortion Movement to join ranks under one issue,
| Female members of the Socialist Workers Party (S¥P)

and Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) from all over the county
were requested by the national office of the SWP ami YSA
to attend this convention in order to insure the effective
control of the convention by the SWP,

As the youth organization of the Socialist
Workers Party (SYP), the’ Young Socialist Alliance ° i wt Me
(YSA) serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official publication,
"The Young Socialist Organizer," as "A multi-
national revolutionary socialist youth organi-

Re: WONAAC

The SWP specifically wished the convention to
adopt a one-issue position, that being the complete
control of the female body by the individual female,
This specific issue, “women control their bodies" was
adopted by the women's organization and all other propo-
sals were rejected,

Workshops were organized for each of the many
separate racial and ethnic groups represented at the
conference, Workshops were based on appeal to the speci-
fic group intended and all were supposedly controlled by
the SWP,

A Black, Raza, Asian-American women's workshop
was held on February 12, 1972, with 35 persons attending.
Among the issues discussed at the workshop were the
attempts of democratic and republican presidential candi-
dates to capitalize on minority group attitudes in regard
to the abortion movement and the fact that minority groups
all to often find themselves without a voice when real
issues are involved,

Of particular importance to the group was the
La Raza Unida Party, a legitimate political party in Texas
which serves to unite Mexican Americans. Of equal impor-
tance was the Gay Liberation Movement, which the group
felt expresses the plight of gay females who do not want
children and are forced to live with men because of the
mores of American society.

Attendees agreed that the one issue of abortion
law.repeal will serve-.to unite-wonrsu und
more effectively serve the Yonen's Movenant,.

The convention adjourned after an agreement that
an "Abortion Action Week"' would be held May 1 - 6, 1972,
This action would serve to keep public attention focused
on the néed to legalize abortion and to seek effective
support from the many thousands of women who want to right
to choose.

Il. ACTIVITIES

A. Conferences and Demonstrations

1. WONAAC Founding Conference was held in New York
City, New York, July 16-18, 1971. This conference called for
national demonstrations to be held on November 20, 1971, in
WDC and San Francisco, California, around the theme of "Repeal
of All Abortion Laws."

(WF T-1, 7/21/71)

f a. On November 20, 1971, approximately 1,500 women,
representing womens liberation groups from the East Coast and
Mid-West, gathered on the Ellipse in V9C, in resoense to the
call by WONAAC to march on the United States Capitol to demand
the repeal of all abortion laws, This grouv devarted the
Ellipse at approximately 10:30 a.m. on that date and marched
along Pennsylvania Avene, N.W., to Cue vest sice of the Capitol |
Building. There the marchers assembled for a.rally which
concluded at approximately 4:00 p.m. on the same date. There
were no incidents of violence and the march and rally were
peaceful throughout.

(WF T-1, 11/23/71)

b. On January 13, 1972, a WONAAC sponsored demonstra-
tion was held from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. in the vicinity of

WFO 100-55420

and the demonstration ended without incident.

(Physical observation, Special
Agents, FBI, 1/13/72)

2. Second WONAAC Conference was held in Boston,
Massachusetts, February 11-13, 1972. Approximately 1,300
women attended the conference, which once again re-established
and reiterated WONAAC's call for abortion on demand. It was
noted during the conference that WONAAC had been unable to
create anything like a national campaign and that local meetings

“eeross the country hed been disappointingly small. It wes

pointed out that WONAAC had failed to attract the large numbers
of working women, housewives, and students concerned with the
abortion issue, including the majority of women's liberationists
and abortion reform activists. It was felt that the movement
could not succeed without the support of the working women.

“At the close of the confereree, WONAAC strongly endorsed
the "Abortion Rights Act of 1972," which\is to be introduced in
the U. S. Congress by Congresswoman BELLA BZUG from New York.
This bill would override all laws which impose sanctions upon’ 2S
those who choose to exercise their individual right to an abortion.

CWE T-1, 2/14/72)

a. Proposed Actions

It was moved and adopted during the above conference

1972, consisting of educational programs, legislative support,
judicial action, and culminating in local or regional demonstra-
tions on May 6, 1972, around the demand for reveal of all anti-
abortion laws and restrictive contraception laws and an end to
forced sterilization.

(WF T-1, 2/14/72)

In addition, the following secondary proposals were
adopted during the conference:



: CONFIDENTIAL
WFO 100-55420

1. That a telegram be sent to the New York
State Court of Anpeals and New York Governor
NELSON A. ROCKEFELLER, condemning the court's
February 10, 1972,:decision denying women on
Medicaid the right to abortions on demand.

2. That the coalition continue to organize black,
Puerto Rican, Chicano, native American and Asian
American participation in their activities.

3. That members of local coalitions confront
candidates for office and force them to take a
stand on abortion, and that they publicize those
who oppose abortion so that the voters can see
where these politicians stand.

4. That the coalition make a special effort to
reach out to and involve "gay" women in their
activities.

(WF T-1, 2/14/72) |

YSA and SWP members of WONAAC felt the conference to

be a succass in that opposition proposals submitted were turned
down in favor of those proposais backed by the YSA-SWP women.

The State University of New York at Binghamton
H is part of the University system of the State of New York,
and the University at Binghamton has an enrollment of
approximately 7,500 students. The student newspaper
published at the University twice weekly during the school
year in its issue of 10/15/71 carried a brief ad in the
classified section as follows: 7

“Women who have had abortions needed to relate
their experiences to other women, educate all women
about abortion at abortion speak out October 21. Contact
Linda L., extention 4130."

The 11/12/71, issue of the "Pipedream", student
' newspaper published at the State University ‘of New York

at Binghamton, carries an announcement that the Binghamton

Womens Abortion Coalition was selling bus tickets. for the

Womens March on Washington for repeal of ail abortion laws,

repeal of all contraception laws and no force sterilization

for 11/20/71. Women and men were invited to attend and

tickets were on sale at the student center. Cars and

volunteers were needed and they were to contact LINDA’ LOEW

at extention 4129.

of approximately January, 1972 until school closed in
May, 1972. This source was contacted 5/16/72. He stated
also at that time, that LINDA LOEW has been a close
associate of BETTYSACHS who is the leader of the Young
Socialist Alliance Chapter on campus at the University.
Informant stated that there was no organization formed to
his knowledge of a Womens | Abortion Action Coalition in
the Binghamton area. ie

Other sources familiar with New Left activities
on the campus of the State University of New York at
Binghamton, were contacted during May, 1972, and two
sources advised that they knew of no organization of
Womens Abortion Action Coalition on the campus or in the
Binghamton vicinity during the past year.

Albany Division has had an investigation pending
on LINDA LOEW and a report is being written with appropriate
recommendation for administrative action on LINDA LOEW.

In view of the lack of activity of an Abortion Coalition
organization in the Binghamton area, no further investigation
is being conducted by Albany.

A. Origin and Objectives

The Boston Women's Abortion Action Coalition

Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC), was formed during
late summer, 1971, out of the local Female Liberation
(FL) group.

Noverber 17, 1971

BOWAAC was originally a subcommittee of FL
in the Greater Boston Area but as of Jenuary, 1972, had
grown into a separete group whose specific interest was
in abortion reform. Individuals active in BOWAAC are

‘also active in other FL work; however, all individuals

active in FL work are not active in BOWAAC, with BOWAAC
being the smaller of the two groups.

votes to remain on a California ballot. The California
Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in
its 1955 report on page forty-six, states in part that the
Independent Progressive Party in California was quickly
captured by the communists and soon was being operated lock,

Jeannette Rankin made the above statement in

woman elected to Congress, she voted against
World War I. She has consistently maintained
her struggle for peace, and at 86 she is as coura+

The presence of the United States forces in the ini

To all American Women:
aes I am proud of the fact that my first

vote cast in Congress was a vote

. against war. It was the first oppor-
unity for a woman to vote, because I
was the first woman to be elected to
Congress.

: I beliaved then, as I do today,
that women are the ones that must be
concerned with the needs and develop-

7 ment of the human race. I have always

: fought for the dignity of all human

| beings - for those of the present as

well as those of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long
as I live. I hope all women will res~
pond to the following call and join me
in Washington on January 8, 1968, the
opening day of Congress.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING UNITED STATES POLICY
IN VIETNAM, WASHINGTON, D. C., JANUARY 8, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING (INTERNAL SECURITY) _

The following information has been made available
by sources who have furnished reliable information in the
past:

Source One reported on December 7, 1967, that copies
of “La Wisp", monthly newsletter of the Southern California
Council of the Women Strike for Peace (WSP - see appendix)
being mailed to the WSP mailing list on that date contained
a "Call" from the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) "To all
American women", announcing a proposed march on Washington,
D. C., on January 8, 1968, when the United States Congress
opens in joint session. This march would be to demand that
Congress, as its first order of business, resolve to end
the war in Vietnam and immediately arrange for the with-
drawal of all American troops. (A xerox duplication of tne
first page of the above-mentioned December 1967 issue of
"La Wisp", containing this "Call", is appended to this
memorandum. ) :

The partial list of JRB sponsors included in this
issue of the "La Wisp", contained the names of only two
women presently active in the Southern California area,
Mary Clarke (see characterization of her in the appendix
page on WSP), and motion picture actress Leslie Parrish.

Source One has advised that Parrish has only
recently become interested in activities of WSP and has
attended less than five WSP activities. Source Two reported

, Rankin Brigade should be made up of only those women who
} ; volunteer to participate with the prior understanding that
' they should be ready to spend at least two months in jail
. for the commission of civil disobedience while in Washington,

Sunderland also suggested that a good way to recruit’
women to join the Brigade would aes make a pitch, for

recruits when Mary Clarke, Dagmar son and Ruth/Krause

. are making their respective speakirig engagements. ‘across the
United States since their return from a trip to Noxth Vietnam,
which they visited as representatives of WSP during the go
fall of 1967. oooane

Source Four advised during the summer of 1965
that June Sunderland, 3730 Hollister Avenue,
Santa Barbara, California, had attended a 1967
"peace conference" in Helsinki, Finland, at the
invitation of the Communist Party ( (CP), and that
funds to cover her expenses were raised in part
by the CP; and that following her attendance at
the Helsinki affair she went on to Russia for ten
days at the invitation and expense of the Soviet
Government, :

Source One learned that a communication was re-
ceived from eastern sponsors of the JRB on December 7, 1967,
indicating that the JRB march on Washington might not be
held on January 8, 1968, but possibly would be set back until
either the 15th or 22nd of January 1968, depending wipon
he date that the United States-Congress would reconvene.
The communication indicated that since the entire purpose :
‘of the Brigade would be to confront the opening joint session
of Congress that it would be futile to schedule the march
prior to the date Congress would veconvene. The suggestion
was made that recruitment of local women to participate in
the RB be heid in abeyance until a confirmation had been
obtained indicating the date on which Congress would reconvene.

Booed Source One, had indicated that although the "Call",
. as reproduced in Ty” Wiso", states, "There wlll be local

. actions across the country’ at the same time as the action
,in Washington, D. C., " that there are no current pians for

Ww.E.B. DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a con-
ference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), including
national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose
of setting in motion forces for the e i anew national
Marxist -oriented youth organization we ant foo the most
peaceful transition to socialism. The e told that it
would be reasonable to assume that the young socialists attracted
into this new organization would eventually pass into the CP

itself.

A second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from Jur, 9-21, 1964,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, Cal MLE» at which

Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention.

The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIKE
ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities
the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist
centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA. This
scurce also advised in Septeeber, 1966 that DAN “ZL RUBIN, CPUSA
National Organizational Sec: apy, stated the Party believes
the DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organiz-—
ation favorable to socialism, socialist countries: and Marxism,
and in April, 1967, advised GUS HALL, CPUSA General Secretary,
had indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing
mass resistance to the draft.

A third: source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at
the Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New
York, from September 8-10, 1967.

A fourth source advised during August, 1967, that JARVIS
TYNER is a member of the National Committee of the CBUSA,

“A £ifth source advised on ‘September 21, 1967, that the
headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West Lith Street, New

York, New York.

- WOMEN FOR PEACE aka

Women Strike for Peace uae

The “Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For .Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.
(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.

(3) Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co-
ordinating Committee, Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general meetings, a: warvanted, are open to
all and anneunced in mailings to ‘memders. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and p' ic meetings, newspaper ads, billboards, and
candicates for public office. On the national level
the gecup attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences.

WITHOUT WOMEN

Women must use their winds, their voices, and
their bodies to stop the killing in Vietnam; to do
less is tc ignore our special responsibilities to

the humen rece.

"10,000 women have sat back and let theit sons
be killed in Vietnam. If we had 10,000 women will-
ing to go to jail if necessary we could stop the war
in Vietnam. You cannot have wats without ronén."

Jeannette Rankin made the above stetement in
Hay of this year. Fifty years ego, as the first”
woman elected te Congress, she voted against World - +
War I. She has consistently maintained her strug—
gle for peace, and et ‘86 she is as courageous and
vigorous as ever -—- an inspitation to-all women.

The ptesence of the United States forces in
the internal sttuggle of Vietnam is immoral and
illegal. There can be no possible justification
for our interference in the domestic affairs of
this tiny distent land.

This 86~yeer-old woman has steted th she ~ ts

we can ascure her that thousands of women will

Dear Friend:

We are sending this letter to you and others fcom whom we have not heard much
recently, in the hope of re-enlisting your efforts in the Women for Peace

movement, It has been too long since we last heard directly from many of you,
and our meetings with those of you whom we have scen recently have been brief,

Of course, we know the paralyzing sense of frustration we all feel occasionally,
as we learn of the mounting horrors in Vietnam, But this feeling is only
temporary, and quickly gives way to activity. 4s women, we bear the major
responsibility for the preservation of life, and thus a major responsibility

in the peace movement,

Enclosed you will find an announcement of the latest national women's effort
for peace. Several peace groups in Portland are cooperating in raising funds
to send representatives to Washington, We hope that you will also support this
effort, to insure representaticn from Portland Women for Peace, The coupon
on the enclosed notice is for your use in this effort.
a
In addition, we will have a supportive peaceful demonstration
in Portland at
NOON, Monday, JANUARY 15th
Pioneer Post Office
5th and Morrison
We are asking participants to wear black, and to bring a black
(or dark colored) umbrella. We shall carry the umbrellas opened,
rain or shine, Placards (to wear) and leaflets (to distribute),
expressing support for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, will be
available, We shall march around the Post Office block for one hour,
from noon to 1 p.m., leafleting as we walk.

we hope, if you cannot go to Washington, yourself, that you will contribute. to
elp someone else to go, and that you will also join with us at the Pioneer
Fost Office at noon Monday, January 15th,

| In addition, please let us hear from you on your ideas of what more we might
co locelly. We have some ideas too, which we hope to share with you, and on
which we shall need much help.

: Please get in touch with one of us soon. Your help, ideas, and efforts are
| urgently needed.

Yours for Peace,

Committee of WSP.

Source three advised in July, 1955, that Mary Clarke
was dropped from Los Angeles County Communist Party
(LACCP) in the Spring of 1955 for personal reasons
and not for any political differences with LACCP.

Source one further reported that Glory Roberts of
Pacoima, California, who is editor of the "Social Action
Communicator", a monthly publication located in Pacoima,
California, recording secretary of the Peace Action Council (PAC)
(See Appendix), and representative to the PAC from the Black
Congress and vice versa, was selected as Chairwoman of a JRB
committee to reach into the black community to get participants
from the Black ghetto involved in the demonstration in
Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1968. Source one advised that
in order to do this, all the organizations comprising the
JRB will have to pledge money to get the women to ee D.C.
and back to Los Angeles, California.

Source one stated that three committees have been
established within the JRB. One of these committees has
been established to draw up a list of redress of grievances.
Each branch of the JRB throughout the nation will, when
gathered in Washington, D.C. as a main committee, decide
the major grievances and the redress of grievances will be
incorporated into a petition to be presented to Congress.
The second committee will be to involve the people in the
black community in the demonstration. The third committee is
to act as a coordinating committee.

the women from Southern California will leave by plane on
Sunday, January 14, 1968 at approximately 10:00 A.M., arriving
Washington, D.C. at approximately 6:00 P.M. on the same date.

and other women making the trip will pay all their own
expenses, No expenses are contemplated while the women are
in Washington, D.C. inasmuch as arrangements have been made
for the women to stay with other WSP members in the
Washington, D.C. area. Source one advised that it is
contemplated all the women will stay in Washington, D.C. until
Tuesday, January 16, 1967.

Source one advised it was reported the women from
across the nation would gather at the Union Depot, Washington, D.C.
at 11:30 A.M. on January 15, 1968. Source one further reported
it is hoped ten thousand women will participate in the
demonstration. After the gathering at Union Depot, the women
will march in solemn procession, all wearing black, to the
steps of the capitol building where the petition containing
the redress of grievances will be presented to the Congress.
Source one further advised it had been reported that Representative
Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield had agreed to receive the
petition. Representative Mc Cormick, according to source one,
had agreed to accept fifteen women in his office at which time
he would receive the petition, but source one advised the
JRB now wants Representative Mc Cormick and Senator Mansfield
to accept the petition on the steps of the capitol building
in order that they might get news coverage. After the petition
has been presented, the JRB wants the redress of grievances
read into the Congressicnal Record.

Further activities of the JRB while in Washington, D.C,
are to includé a three hour "Women's Congress", possibly on the
grounds of Georgetown University.

Mary Clarke pointed out that although the original
intention had been to have only those women participate
in the JRB who were willing to risk arrest for civil disobedience,
she stated at the above meeting that no civil disobedience is
anticipated in view of the large number of organizations
participating who are opposed to such civil disobedience.
However, she further stated that individuals are not going to
be discouraged who might elect to create civil disobedience.

frequently .espouse Communist causes or follow the Communist
Party line, Communist front group literature is distributed
at the church. The church is used by some Communist Party
members for “mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of

ship for Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-
Universalist Fellowship for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the
church since 1948,

fronter" and connected with numerous "Communist front organi-
zations and activities."

Membership in the First Unitarian Church dees not,

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

the Jeannette Rankin Brigade (JRB) with headquarters at
133 West 72nd Street, New York City, originally scheduled
a demonstration in Washington, D.C. on January 8, 1968, to
coincide with the opening of Congress, In view of the
fact that the reconvening of Congress was delayed until
January 15, 1968, the organization rescheduled the
demonstration for that date, The source stated that the
JRB is composed mostly of members of Women Strike for
Peace, a pacifist organization and is using the name of
the JRB only for this one affair.

The above source stated that individuals are to-
meet at Union Station in Washington, D.C., at approximately
11:30 a.m. on January 15, 1968, and then walk in a "silent
procession" to the United States Capitol. Literature sent
out by the local office of Women Strike for Peace indicate
that the women will assemble at Union Station at the above
time and "in solem procession and wearing black, we will
walk to the Capitol steps behind our delegation who will
present our *"Women's Petition to the Congress"* demanding
redress of grievances,"

According to the source, the group wanted to have
Speaker of the House McCormick and Senator Mansfield meet
them on the Capitol steps and accept the above mentioned

5 The source “stated that some of the wonien in the

may be arrested but most of the individuals involved do

not think it advisable to commit acts of civil disobedience,
The source stated that at no time have any Specific details
been mentioned as to the acts of civil disobedience which
might be committed. The source stated that following the

Captain Robert Krahling, United States Capitol
Police, advised on January 3, 1968, that a delegation from
the JRB and their attorney, Joseph ‘rover, met with officials
of the United States Capitol Police on January 2, 1968,

concerning details of the proposed demonstration. ‘These hg ete
individuals were advised by the United States Capitol Police .:
that they cannot demonstrate on the Capitol grounds in sot =

a group or carry placards, as such activity is prohibited ~
by rules of Congress, Forer, as attorney for the group, ©
advised the officials that these women will be coming to

the Capitol as individuals and although they will be walking
together they can only be kept out of the Capitol building
if the police exclude all visitors from the United States
Capitol, Forer argued that such a demonstration on the
Capitol grounds is not a violation of the law by the
participants but a violation of the United States Government
in refusing to allow its citizens to present their grievances
to Congress,

Captain Krahling advised that in addition to
Joseph Forer, the members of the above delegation included
the following individuals:

WOMEN FOR PEACE aka
Women Strike for Peace

The "Berkeley Daily Gazette," a daily newspaper of :
general circulation published in Berkeley, California,
contained an article in the November 19, 1965,evening
edition reflecting that in November, 1961, when con-

cern mounted over radioactive fallout. from nuclear
testing, a group of women in Washington, D. C. started
Women Strike for Peace. The idea spread rapidly through-
out the country and now embraces 900 groups, including
Women For Peace groups in the San Francisco Bay area.

These groups support programs to achieve goals such as:
(1) Continued disarmament negotiations.
(2) A strong and flexible United Nations.-.

(3) Planning now at state and national levels for
conversion to peace-time economy and positive
efforts to ease world tensions.

The women act as individuals and as a group, with specific
actions suggested by individuals and groups from all over
the world. Decision to participate jointly on any given
suggestion is democratly arrived at by members of the Co--
ordinating Committee. Effective cooperation with other
peace groups is encouraged. Monthly Coordinating Committee
meetings and general. meetings, as warranted, are open to
all and announced in mailings to members. There are no
dues or membership forms nor conditions for membership.

To stir an awareness of the need for peace, Women For
Peace encourage public education in peace objectives at
local schools and sponsor peace-oriented demonstrations
and public meetings, newspaper ads, billboards , and
candidates for public office. On the national level
the group attempts to influence government officials

by letters and conferences,

CHICAGO COUNCIL OF AMERICAN-SOVIET
RELATIONS, Formerly known as Chicago
Vouncii of American-Soviet Friendship

EDWIN GORDON FOX, 7147 Jeffrey Avenue, Chicago,
Illinois,(now deceased) made available in January, 1954, the
"First Annual Report CCASF," an undated publication which
stated that the Chicago’ Council of American-Soviet Friendship
(CCASF) was incorporated in July, 1943. This document stated,
"The Council's affiliation with the National Council of
American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) was validated August 11,
(1943). The present name was adopted to conform to standard
national practice. It should be noted, however, that the
Chicago Council is entirely autonomous; the government of its
affairs rests exclusively in the hands of its Chicago Executive
Board," i

On April 8, 1965, a source furnished information to
the effect that as of March 11, 1965, this organization would
be known as the Chicago Council of American-Soviet Relations
(CCASR). MANDEL TERMAN continued to be listed as Chairman of
the new organization.

During April, 1965, a second source advised that
MANDEL TERMAN had arbitrarily dissolved the Board of Directors,
assumed all financial and other functions of the organization,
and was maintaining existing records of the organization at
his residence, 660 West Irving Park Road, Chicago, Illinois.
The aims and purposes of this organization continued to be
to work for peaceful coexistence and friendship with the USSR.
While it claimed to be an autonomous organization, its program
followed the NCASF and it was in frequent contact with the
NCASF.

On November 5, 1958, a third source advised that in
the early 1940s, MANDEL TERMAN was a member-at-large of the
Communist Party (CP) of Illinois. TERMAN was in Russia in
November, 1958, where he had gone to discuss the treatment of
Jews and to discuss Jewish culture in the USSR with the
leadership of the Soviet Union.

health condition of MA the
CCASR, formeriy located at 32 st Randolph Street, Chicago,
were for a short time carried at WANDEL TERMAN'S home resi-
dence, 660 West Irving Park Hoad, Chicago. During the Fall
of 1965 due to the defunctness of the CCASR, the CP of Illinois
found it necessary to sponsor a rally honoring the 48th
anniversary of the Russian Revolution under a temporary
committee called “The Chicago Committee for Amevican-Soviet
Friendship Rally." This rally was held cn November 7, 1965,
and once the rally was held this temporary committee went
out of existence.

The fourth source advised that as of the present
time the CCASR is defunct in the Chicago area and any future
rally to be held on the American-Soviet friendship theme will
have to be organized by the CP of Illinois on a temporary
basis.

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his
understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicags
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the
national group in-New York, was formed shortly thereafter,
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers
in protest against activities of the American Bar Asscciation
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters kut
occasionally uses the return address of its officials in

HELENA, MONTANA

TO ALL AMERICAN WOMEN,

I am proud of the fact that my first vote cast in Congress
was a vote against war. It was the first opportunity for a
woman to vote because I was the first woman to be elected

to Congress,

I believed then as I do today that women are the ones who
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity of all

human beings -~ for those of the present as well as those

of future generations,

I will continue to struggle as long as I live.

I hope all women will respond to the following CALL, and
join me in Washington on January 8, 1968, the opening
- day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

TO COME TO WASHINGTON JANUARY 15. & 16

‘ AMERICAN WOMEN constitute 51% of the voting population, yet a high percentage of us don’t vote. -
It is time for-women to break out of their societal molds and take their place as effective, vocal citi-

economic direction of the nation. WE HAVE WOMEN POWER. Let’s use it to demonstrate our
opposition to this war to the Congress of the United States.

We are a broad coalition of women from many areas of American hfe. We shall meet in Washington
on January 15 for the opening of Congress to demand the following:

1. CONGRESS, AS ITS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS, RESOLVE TO END THE
WAR IN VIETNAM AND IMMEDIATELY ARRANGE FOR THE ite taht
OF ALL AMERICAN TROOPS.

2. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO HEAL A SICK SOCIETY AT HOME,

3. CONGRESS USE ITS POWER TO MAKE REPARATION FOR THE RAVAGED
LAND WE LEAVE BEHIND IN VIETNAM.

4, CONGRESS LISTEN TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND
REFUSE THE INSATIABLE DEMANDS OF THE MILITARY—INDUSTRIAL
COMPLEX.

After we petition the United States Congress, we will hold our own congress to articulate our position
on the basic problem of achieving peace. We declare our intention to return to our communities and
mobilize women to dedicate ourselves to reshaping American society, and restoring our country toa
position of honor in the community of nations.

On January 15, we will meet at the Union Depot in Washington, D.C., at 11:30 A. M., and walk behind
our delegation which will present our petition to the U.S. Congress.

On January 16, many of us will stay in Washington to begin implementation of these demands by

00: NY

Re New York letter to the Bureau, 6/6/72; Bureau 0-7
to 37 York, 7/12/72; and Philadelphia letter to the Bureau,

2/28/73. a

As outlined in referenced New York letter, the /* ‘i
New York Office noted, as far back as June, 1972, it
recognized that, although several leaders of WONAAC were
known to be SWP members, their activities, as pertaining to
“TONAAC, had been directed towrd the legal repeal of all
restrictive abortion laws, and investigation had disclosed
no indication that WONAAC, as an organization, had engaged in
any subversive or vidence prone activity.

Referenced Bureau 0-7, referencing the aforementioned
communication, nevertheless instructed that the New Yak Office, \
as office of origin, had overall responsibility for captioned
organization, and directed the New York Office to reopen its 5
ease and submit semi-annual reports. a

A review of the results of the continuing investigation
of WONAAC, together with all indices and references pertaining
thereto, since June 1972, reflects no apparent change in the 1
activities or the organization @ its membership from that
outlined above.

The New York Office is in accord with the view of the
Philadelphia Division, as set forth in its referenced letter,
that WONAAC represents basically a social change vehicle: which,
despite disparate political views of its leaders and membership,
deals with the single issue of abortion aie

In view of instructions set forth in Bureau
memorandum 10-73, dated 3/6/73, paragraph G, wherein the
Bureau reiterated its policy that the FBI has no interest
in individuals and organizations involved in legitimate
dissent and the recent United States Supreme Court decision
upholding the right to abortion, it appears continued.
investigation of WONASC as such is not justified.

The New York Office further concurs with the
Philadelphia view that continued investigation of the SWP
and/or YSA would produce the desired cove-age am information
concerning its members who are associated or active in WONAAC,

I. ORGANIZATION OF BOSTON WOMEN'S
ABORTION ACTION COALITIOW (BOWAAC)

BOWAAC, the local affiliate of the
Women's National Abortion Action
Coalition (WONAAC), was formed out
of the local Female Liberation group;
and while BOWAAC is not exclusively
made up of Socialist Workers Party
(SWP), Boston, and Young Socialist
Alliance of Boston (¥SA~B) female
members, it is controlled by members
of those groups.

WONAAC has been publicly described
as an organization of groups whose
aim is to effect the overthrow of
existing abortion laws and to demand
free abortion on demand.

The SWP, Boston, is the local affiliate
and follows the aims and purposes of
the national SWP.

The SWP has been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

The YSA~B is the Boston affiliate
of the YSA, the youth organization
of the SWP.

A. Headquarters

In late summer, 1972, BOWAAC moved its headquarters
from 552 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Mass., to
429 Boylston Street, Room 323, Boston, Massachusetts,
telephone 266-3574,

BOWAAC headquarters continues to be located
at 419 Boylston Street, Boston, Room 323.

The New England Telephone 1973 Directory for
the Boston area lists BOWAAC at 419 Boylston Street,
Boston, with telephone numbers 256-3574 and 266-1679.

B. Membership and SWP and YSA Infiltration

BOWAAC is not a formal membership-type group.
There are, however, currently a limited number of activists,
a maximum of fifteen, the majority of whom are members of
the SWP and/or YSA in the Boston area, involved in BOWAAC
work. The number of activists is currently limited as
a number of the formerly active independents in the group
have recently dropped out of BOWAAC work feeling that
the United States Supreme Court decision reluxing legal
restraints on the practice of abortion has resolved the
abortion problems,

Re: National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC)
: Policy Council Meeting

Source, who has furnished reliable information in the
past, provided the following information on July 3,. 1972:

A Policy Council Meeting of the National Women's
Political Caucus (NWPC) was held in Washington, D.C. during
the period June 24, 1972 - dune 25, 1972.

The NWPC is a legitimate, loosely-knit, open
organization of politically motivated women

seeking equal recognition in the American

community. -

During the Policy Council Meeting there were no
overt attempts: by any organized qroup to influence the nolicv
meeting and there were no individuals present who identified
themselves as members of any organization which might be construed
as subversive and/or sunporting any cause except lecitimate
change.

‘
Of significance, however, was the fact that literature |
of the Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (NONAAC) was |
present in brochures and pamphlets located throughout the meeting
area, All of the WONAAC material was geared to the abortion
movement and specifically the NONAAC conference scheduled for
Hunter College, New York, July 15 - 16, 1972.

WONAAC was founded in July, 1971. for the purpose of
forming a national movement of groups scattered
throughout the United States whe favor and -
now work to legalize abortion. The Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA) and Socialist Yorkers Party (SWP)
are playing a major role in “ONAAC,.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to
Executive Order 10450.

Re: NWPC Policy Council Meeting

As the youth organization of the SWP, the
YSA serves as the main source of récruitment into
that organization. The YSA is described in the
masthead of its official publication, "The Young
Socialist Organizer," as "a multinational
revolutionary socialist youth organization."

During the council meeting on June 24, 1972, Mary
Clarke, who is associated with the Southern California PC,
an affiliate of the NWPC, advised a group of policy -council
members that WONAAC had been using the Southern California WPC
name as an endorser of WONAAC. Clarke also stated that WONAAC
had passed out propaganda at a caucus rally in California and
were very effective at taking control of small gatherings.

The Chairwoman from Nassau County in New York, whose
name was not recalled, defended WONAAC stating that "they were
a good group", This woman's position was not supported and,
in general, WONAAC literature was not accepted by those versons
present, Jill Ruckelshaus, a new member of the Policy Council,
is reportedly concerned about the SWP's attempts to align
itself with the abortion movement and will be using her newly
gained position to fight SWP attempts at control of local
WPC groups.

The NWPC organizing brochure published by the NWPC
has been written to assist individual WPC groups in organizing.
The brochure lists political parties and pvara~-volitical
organizations to be contacted by caucus organizers when forming
the nucleus of a WPC. Amonq those listed was the SWP. After
discussions at the caucus it was determined that the SWP should
be removed from the list. The new edition ef the “PC organizing
brochure will not list the SWP; it has been replaced by National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC).

The NPAC was founded in 1970 by members of the SYP.
Its basic objective is to unite masses of people
including labor unions, GIs, and@ the black
community in the struggle to end United States
intervention in Southeast Asia through orderly and
peaceful tactics.

The Women's National Abortion
Action Coalition

Confidential sources one, two and three, all of
whom have furnished reliable information in the past, advised -
on July 18, 19, and 20, 1972, respectively, that a Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (S4asc) Conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street, on
duly 15 and 16, 1972.

Confidential source number one advised that ~
New York City was picked for the site of this convention
because this city is considered to be the center of the most
powerful anti-abortion effort so far. 2

: The WONAAC Conference was open to all women
who supported the Abortion Law Repeal Movement, Registration
was $3.00 per person, Housing and child eare facilities were
available. There were approximately 800 women in attendance
at this conference,

Discussions hid at this conference centered on
plans for (oné-future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and ¢wo}to end
forced sterilization,

A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their
own bodies,

WONAAC is aware of the fact that progress for
these matters will not come easy,-that it will be fought by
various groups step by step all the way, therefore, this
conference was called to discuss all.the different approaches
and to decide on the major direction for WONAAC to take..

The Agenda for the conference followed the
ed agenda set forth by the Working Co ttee,
mentioned abave, with the exception of a change in
the lunch hovr end some of the workshop schedules.

Prior to the Seturday conference, a Soclalist

and Lexington Avenue at nose in attendance at this
.Faction meeting were SVP~YSA comrades from WY¥C and fron i

on the procedure to be f oved at the conference by the
YSA~SUP members in ter of voting on various workshops and
vhat stend to take which vould be more beneficial for the
YSA-SWP. ‘This ° Faction meeting was concluded at approximately
9:30 FM, Foknjee MEMBER OF SUBIECY C7GANIZATION

. The WORAAC Conference procedure continued
uninterrupted with votes on various flgpr discussions y VV,
until an interruption was made by Rose/Meber, a WONAAC /
coordinator. She addressed all YSA-SWP members at the
conference, asking them vhat s thelr real reason for
being in attendance at the WONAAC Conference. She
sceused the YSA-S"P of not being sincerely interested
in abortion rights, but rather being interested in what
was best for the 8 She stated that - ‘because of
the YSA-S'WP influence being enforced on the conference,
she was resig¢ AAC coordinator and staff member.

She getated that she detested the intervention of the YSA-SWP

in this conference; that the SYP-YSA has caused conflict among
the WOHAAC staff and therefore, they cannot work out constructive
solutions to their problems. She also suggested that the "Zero
Population" and planned parenthood have no voice in discussions
at this conference. Finalizing her accusations, she stated the
YSA-SHP members had no mind of their own nor did they have any
freedom of expression of their own. She stated that they only

On duly 15, 1972, a proposal wasyassedby the
Election Workshop which stated in part as follows:

"WOHAAC welcomes women from all political
affiliations and views. We are wl

our own reproduction functions.

"By uniting women of alk political views ve
maximize our strength. Any attempt to Impose one politic al
view on everyone in FONAAC would only destroy our abd
Light together on the abortion question. Therefore ff
as.an organization takes no position on any candidates or
political parties...."

“The political rallies which will no doubt take
place with increa:.ing frequency around the country as
November approaches offer us a forum for getting our ideas
across to great numbers of women. Besides allowing us an
opportunity to force the candidates to take a public stand
on abortion, these gatherings give us a chance to publicize
both WONAAC and the repeal campaign."

basis of one woman, one vote.

: "There shall be a National Coordinating Committee

"That the National Office of WONAAG, as its first

"That the National Office of WONAAC pledged
$1,500 to the defense of the seven women arrested in
Chicago because of their alleged activity in abortion

"Theat the WONAAC National Office maintain, -
at all times, a fund-raising starf efficient enough
to meet the needs of the emergency fund at the same
time it raises sufficient capital to maintain the daily
expenses of the National Office and staff..."

Confidential gyource number twe related that the
evening plenary session of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972,
and it was immediately apparent that the Socialist .
Workers Party - Young Soaialist Alliance (SWP-YSA) group
dominated the meeting. Independent women who wanted to make
statements during this session were voted down by SWP floor
leaders and these same pensons continued to vote as a bloc
on all issues

The group of independent women from various geogra-
phic areas, that is those women who were not associated with the
SWP or YSA, went together after the plenary session was adjourned
and considered the problem of. how to handle the SWP leaders,
While these women were not political realists in their goals,
they did believe in working throughout the existing system
rather than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal
of revolution,

It was decided that the independent feminists would
no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. ‘They did not want
te have decisions for them being structured by a male dominated
group. Tney also decided that money being collected by WONAAC
in the name of abortion law change was not being used for that
purpose, but rather to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

The Sunday morning session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members and
sympathizers were present. Independents there were from New
Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and
San Francisco,

The independents did not waiver in their firm canes
to SWP-YSA control @ WONAAC. Six national coordinators of
WONAAC were independents and decided to resign publicly at
the afternoon plenary session. They also decided to combat
SWP control of the feminist movement through the various

Nancy/Rolf, New_ Rew Yorks and Ellen#Shapiro, _New York. <

There were approximately 700-800 women in attendance:
at the afternoon session. According to one of the SWP :
leaders, these women were frdm 31 states and three countries- :
Canada, Italy and’ Sweden. The states that had more representation
than others were Ohio, Illinois, New York, and Massachusetts,

Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to abortion
law reform, The SWP was charged with always having demonstra-
tions and rallies and never doing any work through the legis-<
lative process,

The independents stated that they were tired of this
hassle and that they believed there were more effective ways
to change abortion laws than carrying placards in the streets,

After the independent women publicly resigned in
front of the plenary session, two other coordinators announced
they were staying on. One was Barbara Roberts, the other's
name is unknown.

Linda Jenness made a final plea for the independent
women to reconsider, The removal of the independents from WONAAC
has d@bilitated the organization and most independent representa-
tives will be going back to their own cities to work for abortion
law change in organizations vhich have no connection with the
SWP. "

The concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform and

. there is also the concern that women new to the movement will

join in a mistaken notion that‘they will be furthering
abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving New York that
they would try to publicize activities from the SHE in an
effort to prevent this.

As the youth orgenization of the Socialist
Workers Party (ENP), the YSA serves as the
main source of reoruitment into that organ-
ization. The YSA is described in the masthead
of its official publication, "The Young .
Socialist Organizer,"-as "A multinational
revolutionary socielist youth organization."

The SWP has.been designated pursuant
to Executive Order 10450.

PH T-1 advised on May 25, 1972, that Women United for
Abortion Rights (WUAR), 1115 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pa.,
telephone WA-2-0381, is the local affiliate of Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC) and that about two weeks ago
WUAR decided to change their name from WUAR to Philadelphia Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (Philadelphia WONAAC) and that
they intended to utilize the same office space at 1115 Walnut
Street and the same telephone number. PH T-1 added that this
change was made inasmuch as the name WUAR was found to be unwieldy
and awkward and that it did not convey the group's affiliation with
WONAAC as well as the new name Philadelphia WONAAC.

An article in "The Sunday Bulletin," Section 2, pages
6 and 7, issue of October 31, 1971, listed the various candidates
for political office in the City of Philadelphia in connection with
the forthcoming elections. Photographs of the following individuals
appeared and background information contained under each individual
photograph indicated that all were members of the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) and that they were also affiliated with the
WUAR_ and/or WONAAC: c

to determine the actual degree of SWP participation in the affairs
of WONAAC in the Philadelphia area and that he was not aware of
any information which would reflect that Philadelphia WONAAC was
substantially controlled by the SWP. Source explained that the
abortion rights issue had frequently been discussed at many of the -
recent public forum type meetings sponsored by the Philadelphia
SWP and held at the Philadelphia SWP Headquarters at 1004 Filbert
Street in Philadelphia. The discussions held on the abortion
rights issue indicated that the SWP felt that the capitalistic
system had used the dual issues of abortion and women's liberation
to keep women in a position of inferiority, whereas the socialistic
system being promoted by the SWP would be in favor of abortion and
women's liberation, and WONAAC would therefore naturally attract
members of the SWP to their organization.

most part, totally controlled by Socialist Workers Party/
Young Socialist Alliance, tne activities of this aganization
should be followed, for the purpose of determining the
extent of influence and control’. by individuals who are
members of Socialist Worxers Party/ Young Socialist Alliance,
and who are acting on behalf of these organizations.

Based upon Bureau instructions, in light of
information set forth in referenced Albany letter, concerning

DIA ARRY, an Socialist Workers Party organizer in the
Utica, NewYork area, and her r@orted communication with

national headquarters of WONAAC in New York City. It would
appear advisable for the Albany Division to institute such
investigation, as it deems appropriate to ascertain the exten

August 9, 1972

Individuals known to be involved in the women's
Liberation movement in the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis
and St. Paul, Minnesota, have, during the past six months,
shown little or no interest in the organization known as the
MWAAC. Former leaders in the women's liberation movement
have become aware of the SWP influence among the leaders of
the group, and have adopted a hands off policy from active
participation in the affairs of this group. While the

. May 6, 1972, rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, was attended by
some 200 individuals, their attendance was considered to be
due to individual interest in the abortion issue.

MP T-2 on
August 17, 1972

SWP_ INFLUENCE

The MWAAC is not a committee of the TCB-SWP, nor
is it a part of the YSA-TCG. Women's liberation is a topic
of general interest and concern to the membership of the
TCB-SWP, and the anti-abortion standard taken by MWAAC is
one aspect of the women's liberation movement of continued
interest.

Members of the YSA-TCG have in the past, “expressed

interest in the support of women's liberation as a matter of

policy. The anti-abortion, or so called legal abortion
movement, is one aspect of this women's liberation movement
which continues to be of concern to members of the YSA-TCG,
both male and female. While the vast majority of women in
the State of Minnesota support either the repeal or changes
in present state laws on abortion, supporters of this repeal
or change also include professional women, medical doctors,
lawyers, municipal court judges, and individuals from all

in New York City (NYC), details of which will be set out”
more fully hereinafter.

As ‘the youth organization of the’
SWP, the YSA serves as the main
source of recruitment into that
organization. The YSA is described
in the masthead of its official
publication, "The Young Socialist
Organizer", as "a Multi-National
Revolutionary Socialist Youth
Organization".

The SWP has been designated pur-
suant to Executive Order 10450.

I. ORGANIZATIONAL DATA

A. Origin and Scope

WY T-2 on July 21, 1971, and NY T-3 on October 1,
1971, furnished information that over 1,000 women met in
conference at Columbia University, NYC, NY, on July 16;
1971, through July 18, 1971, to form a National Movement
of independent groups scattered throughout the United
States (US) who favored and had worked to legalize abortion.
As a result of this conference, WONAAC was founded.

B. Aims and Purposes

In the WONAAC national newsletter, dated September 16,
1971, WONAAC was self-described as a nationally coordina-
ted abortion law repeal campaign including legislation;
legal action, and nationally coordinated mass demonstrations
in Washington, DC, and San Francisco, on November 20, 1971,
for the repeal of all anti-abortion laws and corollary
demands of no forced sterilization, and the repeal of all
restrictive contraception laws. WONAAC claims to reach
all women, black; Chinaca; Latina; Asian; Puerto Rican;
native American women; campus women; gay women; high
school women; housewives; professional, welfare, and
working women; young women; women from churches, political
organizations, trade unions, the military, and communities

: c. Headquarters

On ataear ies 22, 1972, a Special Agent (sa) of
the Federal Bureau of Thvestigation (FBI), utilizing a .
pretext, contacted an individual self-identified as CAROL
EATON at telephone number 675-9150, located at 150 5th .
Avenue, NYC, NY. EATON, who stated she is currently a
National Staff member of WONAAC, advised that the National
and NY Staffs of- WONAAC are meaniesinsaiiisuiiiel at this address;

D. When a_Mestings Hela

: According to CAROL EATON, regular NY Coalition
meetings of WONAAC are held every other Wednesday evening
at Religious Center at New York University, 2 Washington
Square North, NYC, NY. EATON stated that most NY State
staff members are present at these meetings and at least
one or more National Staff members also try to be in
attendance. Other than this, state and national ena Saal
meet Beriee eels as business demands.

E. Officers

EATON identified the following individuals as

current officers of WONAAC:

F. Me exship and Binances.

. ‘According to EATON, “WONAAC does not maintain a
formal membership, as such, and financially exists only:
through voluntary contributions. She stated that all
staff members , National and NY State, serve on a voluntary
basis, receive no salary, and get only a small "subsistance
allowancé" which the staff has found necessary to supplement
with their own personal | funds in order to get bye.

G._WONAAC Affiliates

CAROL EATON stated there are presently 36 WONAAC
affiliates, also called "coalitions" throughout the US, and
that most states of the union are represented by an affiliate
or goalition. 2 7

Ii. YSA-SWP INFLUENCE AND CONTROL
OVER_WONAAC

NY T-1 provided information on July 22,. 1971,

that the First National Womens Abortion Conference was

held at Columbia University, NYC, NY, from July 16, 1971, -
to July 18, 1971, which resulted in the founding of WONAAC.
NY T-1 stated that it was immediately apparent that this
conference was taken over and influenced by YSA-SWP members
who infiltrated the various conference committees and
workshops which were established to help formulate the
main direction the Coalition would follow in the future.

NY T-1 stated that it seemed certain the YSA-SWP would,

in the future, dictate policy for this organization and

won be able to control the utilization of WONAAC funds.

on August 5, 1971, NY T-4 provided a leaflet

: captioned, “What Every Woman Should Know". This leaflet,

which was published by Feminist Organization for Communi-
cation; Action and Service (F.0.C.A.S.), related the following:

"The Womens National Abortion Coalition has_
been called and organized by the SWP and its affiliate,
the YSA, including women supposedly representing Women's

Liberation groups, who in truth represent, first, the

Nw 55088

DocIai32989545 Page 447



NY 100-174481
-SWP and YSA. These women attach more importance to their
political movement than.to the Women's Liberation Movement.
And when 77% of the women in this country are for reform
of abortion laws, there is fertile soil for a political’ .
party to build itself on. The SuP/YSA realizes this and

} is taking advantage of it." and

i Pere eee caus on August 5, 1971, a leafiet
Berean RN aE Seear ; captioned "FOC, A.S." revealed
7 vo. 7:7 in part as follows:

"A nucleus of about eight feminists

“have formed FOCAS, Feminist

Organization for Communication,

. aa Action and Service. FOCAS evolved

| 7 A from the Women's Strike Coalition

i : (WSC), which the Socialist Workers

Party abruptly abandoned on May

i 25th in order to form the committee

: for WONAAC. Since that time a

nucleus of women from WSC together
with like-minded feminists pre-
served the WSC in order to main-
tain and expand a multi-issue

aa action-oriented Women's Libera~
tion coalition in the NYC area.
Assisted by loans from supporting
feminists, the new WSC paid
back nearly a thousand of the
three thousand dollars of debts
incurred by the SWP women who
had controlled the old WSC.

The "Militant" issue of August 6, 1971, page five,
in an article entitled, "Abortion Campaign Counters Red-
Baiting", revealed in part, with respect to the founding
WONAAC conference in July, 1971: i

"The Militant" is a weekly news-
paper of the SWP.

"There were many members of the SWP and YSA at the
conference, and SWPers and YSAers are among those who
havé worked most consistently for abortion repeal and to
build the abortion conference...."

yg NY T-5 advised on November 12, “1971, that a NY
Planning Meeting of WONAAC was held at LOEB Student Center,
NY University, NY, on November 11, 1971, to lay plans
for a scheduled November 20, 1971 demonstration in Washington,
DC. According to this source, this meeting was completely
dominated and controlled by members of the SWP.

NY T-6 related on November 16, 1971, that the Upper
West Side Branch of the YSA planned to send a contingent
of its members to Washington, DC, on November 20, 1971,
in order to participate in the planned demonstration there
on that oe

NY T-6 stated ‘that practically all the members of the

uptown branch of the YSA, NY, were expected to participate

in this activity.

NY @-5 related on January 20, 1972, that the scheduled
November 20, 1971 march in Washington was "crucial" to
all SWP and YSA branches in that it afforded an opportunity
for selling of "The Militant" and other SWP/YSA literature,
and also afforded an opportunity for “intervening " in the
action via distribution of SWP Election Campaign literature.

NY T- 8 on February 11, 1972, and NY T-9 and NY T-10

on February 14, 1972, provided information that a WONAAC

convention was held February 11, 1972, to February 13, 1972,
at Hayden Hall, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts.
The general theme of this convention was "How to Win
Abortion Law Repeal". NY T-8 stated that approximately

30 members of the YSA or SWP Boston Chapters were cbservyes
in attendance at this convention.

NY T-7 related on February 14, 1972, that because of the

_ de-escalation of the Vietnam War by the NIXON Administration,

anti

NY loO-i7aae1

Committee (SMC) and N¥ National Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC), both of which organizations they dominate, would
also concentrate in the area of the Women's Liberation
Movement through their influence in WONAAC.

i The SMC is controlled by the

SWP and its youth affiliate,
YSA. SMC initiates and supports
public demonstrations against
the war in Southeast Asia.

NPAC was founded in 1970 by
members of the SWP. Its objec-
tive is the immediate, total
and unconditional withdrawal
of all US forces and material
in Southeast Asia.

. NY T-7 advised on various dates, March 23, 1972,
through October 17, 1972, that activities’ of WONAAC were
dutifully reported and included on the agenda at regular
meetings of the Upper West Side Branch, YSA-New York Local
(NYL) during that period.

‘) NY T-5 advised on April 18, 1972, that the leader-
ship of WONAAC was then dominated by the SWP.

NY T-7 related on July 7, 1972, that at a WONAAC
meeting held June 27, 1972, at 706 Broadway, NYC, NY,
starting at 6:40 PM, it was announced that even though
WONAAC previously had accused various female activists
working along with them in the Women's Liberation struggle
of red baiting because of the stand they had taken against
the SWP-Young Socialist Alliance (YSA), at present they
are forced to work with these individuals to help strengthen
the WONAAC cause. :

At this meeting, certain WONAAC staff members
walked out and voiced their disapproval of the meeting i
being taken over by a majority of SWP-YSA members.
They indicated that the SWP-YSA has no right to be in a
policy-making position in WONAAC.

NY 100-174481 4

NY T-7 on-July- 18, 1972, and NY T-11 on July 19,
1972, provided information that a WONAAC conference was
held at Hunter College, Park Avenue and 69th Street on
duly sagt 1972°and July 16, 1972. :
NY T-7 stated that NYC was picked as the site of
this convention because this city is considered to be
the center of the most powerful anti- ~abortion effort so far.
- Discussionsheld at this conference centered on
plans for (one)~future activity in the campaign to repeal
all anti-abortion and contraception laws and (two) -to
end forced sterilization.

- A discussion was held concerning the attacks
being made by the Catholic Church Hierarchy and other
anti-abortion groups against women's rights to their own
bodies:

: NY T-11 related that the evening plenary session
of WONAAC occurred on July 15, 1972, and it was immediately
apparent that the SWP-YSA groups dominated the meeting.
Independent women who wanted to make statements during
this session were voted down by SWP ‘floor leaders and
these same persons continued to vote as a block on all
issues.

The group of independent women from various
geographic areas, that is, those women who were not
associated with the SWP or YSA, went together after the
plenary session was adjourned and considered the problem

_.0of how to handle the SWP leaders. While these women
were not political realists in their goals, they did
believe in working throughout the existing system rather
than functioning with the SWP in their eventual goal of
revolution.

It was decided that the independent feminists
would no longer continue hassling within WONAAC. They
did rot want to have decisions for them being structured
by a'male dominated group. They also decided that money
being collected by WONAAC in the name of abortion law

NW 55088 Docld:32989545 Page 451



NY 100-174481

change was not being used for that purpose, but rather
to sustain members of the SWP-YSA.

a The Sunday morhing session, July 16, 1972, was
labeled "Meeting to Discuss Internal Hassles." About 35
independents attended and a few number of SWP-YSA members
and sympathizers were present. Independents. there were
from New Haven, Boston, Detroit, New York (NY), Chicago,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco.

The independents did not waiver in their firm
opposition to SWP-YSA control of WONAAC. Six national
coordinators of WONAAC were independents and decided ta
resign publicly at the afternoon plenary session. ‘They
also decided to combat SWP control of the feminist move-
ment through the various publications.

ES
: The six national coordinat who fesigned were
7 PHERS, San Frangisco; ANN C,ADAVIDSON, Philadelphia;
VyE ROSt ER, NY; vronpésna Ry, Columbia, South, Carolina;
ROLE, NY; and

HAPIRO 1_NY NY.

There were approximately 700-800 women in atten-
dance at the afternoon session. According to one of the
SWP leaders, these women were from 31 states and three
countries-Canada, Italy and Sweden. The states that had
more representation than others were Ohio, Illinois, New
York and Massachusetts.

Ch.

toni OF SUBIC

Most of the problems and differences between the
independents and the SWP centered around approaches to’
abortion law reform. The SWP was charged with always
having demonstrations and rallies and never doing any
work through the legislative process.

The independents stated that they were tired of
this hassle and that they believed there were more ef-
fective ways to change abortion laws than carrying placards
in the streets.

from WONAAC has debilitated the organization and most

independent, representatives will be going back to their

own cities to work for abortion law change in organizations

which have no connection with the SWP.

the concern still exists, however, that WONAAC will
be able to collect monies in the name of abortion reform
and there is also the concern that women new to the move-
ment will join in a mistaken notion that they will be~
furthering abortion law reform.

Independents vowed before leaving } NY that they
would try to publicize activities from the SWP in an
effort to prevent this.

III. OBSERVATION OF CURRENT NATIONAL
STAPF MEMBER REGARDING YSA/SWP INFLUENCE

When contacted under pretext on November 24,
1972, CAROL EATON, self-identified as a current National
Staff member, and previously mentioned in this report,
related that she has been active in WONAAC since its
inception. EATON, while @Y°TF99 she is definitely not a
YSA, SWP, or member of any “radical group", acknowledged
there always have been SWP, YSA and "radical" elements
in WONAAC. She went on to state, however, that WONAAC
has never allied itself politically with any organization
ox individual, including any of the political candidates
in the recent political election and, despite its diverse
makeup as too ideaological beliefs of its membership,
WONAAC is basically an organization which strives only
to the objectives for which it was originally founded.
To this end, she went on, WONAAC would accept help from
whatever source offered.

ia a

EATON admitted there were some problems in

and YSA influence. She stated, however, this matter, to
her observation, never seemed a serious*one, and is quite.
minimal today. With regard to the "walk out" of six
national coordinators at the July, 1972 conference in NYC,
she stated the walk out did not occur, in fact, because.
of the SWP/YSA influence question, but rather because
those who walked out believed WONAAC should be a "referral
agency", while those who stayed felt it should not. By :
referral agency, EATON statedshe means an agency which would refer
callers to a specific ereaciianial or place where abortions.

could be obtained.

Iv. PLANNED PROJECTS.

CAROL EATON advised that WONAAC plans an inter-
national Tribunal march to be held in NYC, NY, from March 9, .
1972, to March 11, 1972. She stated plans have not yet been
finalized, including the exact location or site this event eee
will take place. However, she noted that SIMONEXSEAUVOIR, Epes
a Parisian, well known in the Women's Liberati Movement , eae
would be honorary chairwoman.

WOMEN'S NATIONAL ABORTION
ACTION COALITION (WONAAC)

During the latter part of February, 1973, a confidential
source, who has furnished reliable information in the past,
advised that the Washington, D.C. (WDC) Chapter of the Women's
National Abortion Action Coalition (D.C. WONAAC) is scheduled
to participate in an "International Woman's Day Solidarity
Meeting" scheduled to be held in New York City, New York on
Saturday, March 10, 1973, place to be announced.

The national office of WONAAC is located at
150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York.
WONAAC goals are self~defined as "working
on a national scale to make abortion legal,
to end restrictive contraception laws, and
to end forced sterilization."

According to the above source, a flyer distributed
by D.C. WONAAC disclosed that among those individuals
scheduled to speak at the meeting are; GISELE HALIMI, described
as a leader of "Choisir," a French abortion rights organization;
MICHELE CHEVALIER, described as a defendent in a French abortion
trial; and CLAUDE SERVAN SCHREIBER, described as a feminist
journalist and as a leader of "Choisir".

According to the above source, members of the 7
i WDC Locals of the Young Socialist Alliance (YSA) and the
I Socialist Workers Party (SWP) have been urged to participate
in the International Womans Day Solidarity Meeting. 1

i As the youth organization of the SWP, the

\ YSA serves as the main source of recruitment
into that organization. The YSA is
described in the masthead of its official
publication "The Young Socialist Organizer",
as "A multinational revolutionary socialist
youth organization."

The SWP has been designated pursuant to
. Executive Order 10450.

00; NEW YORE

RePHlet 2/28/73.

The Women's National Abortion Action Coalition (WONAAC)
has been the subject of a separate investigation by the Bureau
in numerous offices, In referenced letter, Philadelphia pointed
out that WONAAC represents 2 basic Socisi change dealing with
abortion rights and that in view of the fact the U.S, Supreme
Court upheld the right cf abortion, the continued investigation
of WONAAC at this time dees not appear to be desirable and
should be discontinued. Philadelphia also suggested that
continued investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
and its youth group, the Young Sccialist Alliance (YSA), showid
determine pertinent activities of WONAAC.

After careful consideration of this matter, the Bureau
agrees with the cbhservations of the Philadelphia Office that the
investigation of WONAAC showid be discontinued, However, in view
of the fact that WONAAC is dominated and controlled by the SWP, a
Trotskyist communist organization cited by the Attorney General
pursuant to Executive Order 10450, it is the responsibility of the
Bureau to investigate and report pertinent information relating
to the extent of SWP domination and control of ‘eaptioned

: yw organization.
v

Therefore, recipients should close separate
WY investigations conceraing WONAAC, In the future, report above-
described information regarding WONAAC under appropriate subheading
in the SWP semiannual organizational reports,

Re Philadelphia letter to Bureau dated 1/31/73 -
and Bureau letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73.

For the information of New York, referenced Bureau
letter to Philadelphia dated 2/12/73 authorized a continued
investigation of WONAAC utilizing only established sources,

\ The Bureau further advised that the investigation was to be.
conducted in a most discreet manner and that no action was

to be taken which could in any way be construed as infringement
by the FBI on academic freedom at the University of Pennsylvania,

The case file of captioned organization has be
2 ,, >, reviewed as well as all indices references to captioned
at organization and it has been determined that while some o
’ the individuals associated with WONAAC in the Philadelphia
area are also known to be affiliated with the Socialist

co Workers Party (SWP) and for the Young Socialist Alliance
(YSA), the majority of WONAAC supporters appear to be
St individuals interested in,social change rather than revolu-
7 . tionary political chagga0 rc 13

In view of the fact aS WONAAC represents aus
a social change vehicle dealing with the single issue of
abortion rights and the fact that a recent U. S. Supreme
Court decision upheld the right to abortion, thereby reducing
the political value of this issue, it would appear that a
ntinued investigation of WONAAC at this time is not
‘desirable.

Therefore, it is recommended that this investi-~

continued investigation of the SWP and/or the YSA should
produce the desired data regarding their activities without
taking the risk of embarrassment inherent in a continued
investigation of WONAAC,

Re Minneapolis letter and letterhead memorandum

fhe Minnesota Supreme Court on 2/2/73 declared the
state's abortion law unconstitutional in its entirety
based on the 1/22/73 decision of the U.S, Supreme Court
wherein it was ruled that the states cannot prohibit abortions
during the first six months of pregnancy.

The decision of the Minnesota Supreme Ccurtlas
resulted in several Twin Cities area hospitals in Minneapolis \
and St, Paul, Minnesota, offering facilities and providing 4
necessary procedures for staff members to perform abortions jen
under these court rulings.

Gp 2851-78) who has furnished reliable information
in the past, has”advised that the object of the captioned
group was to remove anti-abortion laws from the books in the
state of Minnesota, as well as in the United States.

On 2/16/73 this source further related that the
Women's Liberation Movement supporters in the Twin Cities
area have generally reacted favorably to the court decisions
relating to abortion laws and now that the principal object
of the Minnesota Abortion Action Coalition has been achieved,
the influence of its spokesmen is expected to decline,

Office, published by the National Office of WONAAC and
ealling attention and urging the attendance of recipients
to legislative hearings on abortion, ‘scheduled to be held
in the state capital building in Albany, New York, on
January 30, 1973. The flyer indicated that testimony
would be heard from medical and legal experts on abortion
along with reports from women who have had legal as well
as illegal abortions. Those attending were urged to visit
their legislators in the morning and attend the hearing in
the afternoon.

On 1/9/73, SA WILLIAM R, CLOUGH, utilizing a
pretext of an anonymous newspaper reporter, ascertained from
an unknown female at National office of WONAAC, located at
150 Fifth Avenue, New York City, New York (telephone 212- 7

the aforementioned hearings and that several buses accommodating/ a

headquarters of WSP at 5899 West Pico Boulevard, and WLA at
5889 West Pico Boulevard, Los Angeles. During the most

Dear WSPER:

Momen Strike for Peace nationally is supporting the Jeannette Rankin Brigade.
Planeloais, trainloads and carloads of women will be coming into Washington on Mon-
day, January 15th, from all over the country.

Ye are particularly pleased with this action because it represents for the first
time a real coalition of women's peace groups, church groups, theatre personalities, |
and community leaders.

The Day is envisioned as a solemn, dignified confrontation of those who should be

ca abeabeni the ever growing opposition to the war. We ask that you write your Con-

gressmeh urging that they support the four points listed in the enclosed Call as Con~
gress reconvenes, Later in the afternoon at our Women's Congress we want to be able to
report on Congressional responses,
i :
: We will ail meet at Union Station in Washington at 11:30 AM and slowly walk to the
Capitcl. We ask the women to wear black. We will be led by Jeannette Rankin who will
oroceed to the top of the Capitol steps with a representative delegation of 50 women to
cresent our petition to the two men who represent the whole of Congress, Senator Mike
id and Speaker of the House McCormack. The delegation will read the demands be- _
ore the assembled women and the two Congressmen, Leaving the Hill, the women will enter
uses for a motorcade to a Congress of American Yomen (place to be announced), . Women
ill present an analysis of the current crisis on the war front and the domestic front,
ing to suggestions for program and actions to be taken back i: our communities for im-
sentation.

a

Women may choose to remain in Va shington the next day to meet with their Congressmen.

£ you wish to stay and wish help in securing accommodations, contact the Hospitality Com

for a woman to vote, because I was the first woman to be
elected to Congress.

I believed then, as I do today, that women are the ones that
must be concerned with the needs and development of the
human race. I have always fought for the dignity. of all
human beings ~ for those of the present as well as those

of future generations.

I will continue to struggle as long as I live. I hope all
women will respond to the following call and join me in
Washington on January 15, 1968, the opening day of Congress.

With highest hopes,

JEANNETTE RANKIN

information in the past, advised in December, 1967, that

the Jeannette Rankin/“Brigade (JRB) had been formed primabily

by members of Women Strike for Peace, a pacifist organization,

Members of Women Strike for Peace had formed the organization
,, following a statement made by former Congresswoman Jeann tte
A Rankin of Montana, in which she stated that if 10,000 American

Housewives were willing to be arrested, they could stop

the war in Vietnam. According to the source, the JRB was

formed as a "one shot organization" to sponsor a demonstration

in Washington, D.C., when Congress reconvenes.in 1968,

The same source advised that January 15, 1968,
had been established as the date of the above demonstration
in view of the fact that Congress was reconvening on that
date. The source stated that the headquarters of the JRB
was located in New. York City and that officials there and

, in other large United States cities including Los Angeles,

7 San Francisco and Washington, D.C,, were formulating the
plans for a "march on the United States Capitol" where
the women would present to the United States Congress a
petition demanding that the Congressmen end the war in
Vietnam, The source stated that a small minority in the
above organization were in favor of commiting acts of civil
disobedience and being arrested. but the vast majority of
the organization wanted a peaceful demonstration to again
focus the Congressional attention upon the war in Vietnam,

The same source advised in January, 1968, that
representatives of the JRB met with officials of the United
States Capitol Police on sevdral occasions and attempted

“INFORMATION CONCERNING
(INTERNAL SECURITY)

Crisis at Home." Several women followed the marchers
carrying another banner which read "United States Women
Unite, End the War in Vietnam." Initially, the group carried
other placards which read "End the War" and "LBJ Eats
Imperial Margarine."' However, at the request of authorities, _
these placards were discarded. i

f i
Before the demonstrators left Union Station, a Ley

to the Capitol where they presented a petition to

Representative John W. McCormack, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, and to Senator Michael J, Mansfield, The

out the opposition of women of the United States to the

ruthless slaughter in Vietnam and the persistant neglect to

withdraw all America troops. It called for Congress to use its
power to help a sick society at home, to make reparations for
destruction in Vietnam and to listen to what the American people
are saying and refuse the insatiable demands of the military

INFORMATION CONCERNING

The ‘Kansas City Star" newspaper, Kansas City,
Missouri, edition of January 14, 1968, contained an article
stating that Kansas City women were responding to a "woman
power" appeal issued by Miss Jeanette Rankin, former member
of Congress, to end the war in Vietnam. According to the
article, a small delegation of Kansas City women plan to go
to Washington, D. C., on January 15, 1968, to participate in
the march by the "Jeanette Rankin Brigade” to petition Congress
for a United States withdrawal from Vietnam. The others in
the group would remain in Kansas City and present copies of
the petition to the offices of U. S. Representatives Richard
Bolling, Kansas City, Missouri, and Larry Winn, Kansas City,
Kansas, at 1:00 p.m., on January 15, 1968.

The "Kansas City Star" evening edition of January
15, 1968, carried an article stating that on the afternoon
of January 15, 1968, 20 women appeared at the offices of
Representatives Bolling and Winn. They carried no signs
and the demonstration was orderly. The women, all from the
greater Kansas City area, merely presented a petition asking
Congress to end the war in Vietnam and withdraw American
troops, to make reparations for the “ravaged land we leave
behind in Vietnam", and to listen to the American people
and refuse "the insatiable demands of the military-industrial
complex". The article stated that the Kansas City branch of
the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom
had been planning to send representatives to the Washington
march, but it was not until Wednesday that they decided to
present the petitions to Congressmen Winn and Bolling.

According to the article, Mrs. John M.“Swomley 5 Ure, |
Program Chairman of the organization, stated the Kansas City _
group hoped to identify with the women in Washington and their
objective to bring and end to the war in Vietnam. eo

demonstrators would then proceed to the Western Union Office on
10th and Market Streets in San Francisco, so that the women
protestors could send wires to their congressmen, protesting
United States policies in Vietnam. Bridges indicated that the
petitioners would request Mayor Alioto to convey to Congress
their petition, which among other things urged Congress, as its
first order of business, to resolve to end the War in Vietnam and
immediately arrange for withdrawal of all American troops from
Vietnam; for Congress to use its power to heal the sick society
at home and to make reparations for the ravaged lands left
behind in Vietnam,

A source advised March 2, 1967, thet Mrs. H.
Bridges, also known as Nikki Bridges, 35
Kronquest Court, San Francisco, California, was
listed as a recipient of a new yearly subscription
to the "People’s World" (PW), expiration date
March 4, 1968.

The PW is a west coast communist newspaper,
published weekly in San Francisco. bs

The next speaker was identified as_Aile
She spoke for approximately five minutes and brtefly~explained
to the demonstrators who Jeannette Rankin is and what the purposes
of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade are, She stated that the group
has no principal spokesman and it is principally a group of
women who are involved and committed in a fight for peace.

Several of the demonstrators, led by Nikki Bridges,
then proceeded to the Office of Mayor Joseph Alioto to present
their petition.

DEMONSTRATION PROTESTING U. S.
POLICY IN VIETNAM

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
JANUARY 15, 1968

Approximately ten minutes later the Mayor of
San Francisco appeared on the steps of the City Hall and announced
to the demonstrators that he would gladly transmit their
petition to Congress. . Mayor Alioto stated that he fully
believed in the constitutional right of peaceful assembly.
He indicated, however, that because he had consented to
transmit the demonstrators' petition to Washington, he did not
necessarily agree with it. The Mayor then stated that it
was his personal opinion that the United States Government and
the Johnson Administration had done all in its power, to attempt
to come to a peaceful and honorable solution in the Vietnamese
War. He related that he felt that it was now up to the other
side to make the same attempts to arrive at a peaceful solution
in the Vietnamese conflict.

At approximately 12:45 p.m., the demonstrators proceeded
to the Western Union Office located et 10th and Market Streets
in San Francisco, so that wires could be sent to their congressmen
in Washington.

A Special Agent of the FBI observed one Elaine

the demonstration Yoneda was observed to return to her ae
at the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
CILWU) - Pacific Maritime Association, Pension Fund, at 150
Golden Gate Avenue,’ San Francisco.

A second source advised on December 4, 1967, that
Elaine Yoneda is a current and active member of the Communist
Party (CP). .

On January 15, 1968, a Special Agent of the FBI
observed a silent protest by a group of women on the lawn
of Colton Hall, Monterey, California, between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m.
These women were ostensibly gathered to support the demonstration
being held in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin
Brigade. There were no speeches given; the demonstrators merely
conducted a silent vigil.

A one page leaflet captioned "Women To Take First
Step to End The War" printed by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade,
at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, was handed
out at the above demonstration. A Xeroxed duplication of this

leaflet is appended to this memorandum. ‘

JANUARY 15, 1968
INFORMATION CONCERNING

Reference is made to a memorandum,
captioned as above, dated December 28, —
1967, at Miami, Florida. The memorandum
cpncerned a call issued by the Jeannette

Fania Brigade for American Women to travel
to Washington, D. C. on January 15, 1968,
to petition the United States Congress to
end the war in Viet Nam.

A sourge, on January 15, 1968, advised that the Miami
Chapter of the“Women's International League for Peace and
Freedon (WILPF) had scheduled a demonstration to take place
January 15, 1968, at Miami, Florida. The demonstration
would be a support activity’ for the Jeannette Rankin Brigade
that would be in Washington, D. C. on that date to petition
Congress to end the war in Viet Nam.

The January 16, 1968, issue of

the "Miami Herald," a local Miami, Florida

newspaper, contained an article entitled

"Five Thousand Women Join Viet War Protest."
. The article identified Jeannette Rankin _

as an 87 year old woman pacifist and an

former member of Congress who voted in

Congress against the American entry into

both world wars.

A Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation (FBI) on January 15, 1968, observed an anti-war
demonstration take place in Miami, Florida. Approximately
70 participants, mostly elderly women, assembled at the
Torch of Friendship, Bayfront Park, downtown Miami, at
2:00 p.m. They stood in silent vigil, some wearing black

No incidents were observed to occur.

Source also advised that at least six people from wotes
greater Miami had considered traveling to Washington, D. C. ppaeeruuenJnees
to participate in the demonstration in that city being
sponsored by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade although no firm
plans had been made. Among these individuals was Greta

CHICAGO CHAPTER

A source advised on May 9, 1967, that it was his
understanding that the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) was
formed around 1936 in New York City, and that the Chicags
Chapter of the NLG (CCNLG), which is affiliated with the
national group in New York, was formed shortly thereafter,
possibly in 1937 by a group of liberal progressive lawyers
in protest against activities of the American Bar Association
which they claimed was a non-liberal, non-progressive
organization. The CCNLG has no established headquarters but
occasionally uses the return address of its officials in
literature.

The women were carrying placards indicating they were the
local representation of the JRB. They also had two leaflets
for distribution (Xerox copies of which are appended to this
memorandum) which called for women to participate and which
indicated that a voting block of American women had the power
to put an end to the war in Vietnam. These leaflets bore the

Two as a militant black nationalist, who has been extremely
active in recent months in disturbances at Manual Arts High
School, Los Angeles, which resulted in a court injunction to

of women to form a strong voting block which could produce
legislation to end the war in Vietnam,end povérty and “legislated

| At 10:50 AM, the women marched to the steps on the
First Street side of the Los Angeles City Hall for a second
| rally. A count made as the demonstrators marched between the
i 7 Old State Building and the City Hall revealed that 250

-- adult Caucasians (majority of whom were women dressed in
black), and eight non-Caucasian adults were involved, plus
some younesters and infants. The mother of one of the children
. had a cardboard sign, depicting a bomb and the caption, "I'm
4 Glad I'm Not Vietnamese", strapped to the back of her son who
appeared to'be less than four years of age.

oSrlote€ Shermen was introduced as the wife of
~ Laurence Sherman, it being pointed out that he was an-~ ~~ -
unsuccessful candidate for public office, on a peace slate,
during 1967, but that both he and his wife were continuing the
fight for an end to the war in Vietnam. She said, "It is time
for us to re-examine our role.as women. Women are a vehicle
for givi ng life. We will not be a vehicle for perpetuation

of wars" She then read some anti-war quotes from Henry David
Thoreau, “indicating they were as timely today, as when he wrote
them. :

Margaret Wright stated that wherees the majority of
women in the demonstration were wearing black to denote mourning,
that she and her non-Caucasian associates who feel, "Black is
beautiful" were dressed in white to indicate their attitude of
mourning. She called for the elimination of ROTC (Reserve
Officers Training Corps) from local high schools and junior
colleges, adding, "ney have got to get | live bullets out of the
schools, and get some live teachers in. She repeated these
same statements during the afternoon when the JRB moved to
the Los Angeles City Board of Education.

As the rally was breaking uo, Wright grabbed the :
public address system and said that it had been learned that i
the City Council was’ in session inside the City Hall Building. |

She urged the women not to.disperse, but to join her and. -
others in invading the City Council Chambers with a demand
that the JRB be allowed to speak to the Council even though
they had not made previous arrangements for a place. on the
agenda that day. Some of the women were already out of range
of the public address system and did not hear this announcement
by Wright, having already been dismissed by, Sissons and told to
reconvene at the Board of Education following luncheon.

Approximately 200 of the demonstrators did enter
the Council Chambers. They got word to the councilmen, through
one of the staff members, that they wisned to be heard.
A motion to allow a JRB representative to address them was
put before the Council, and defeated by a vote of six to five.
Immediately following this vote, there was a unanimous vote
that the Council adjourn, As the councilmen filed out of the
room, Tima Tomash rushed to.the front shouting demands that
they return, while other of the women hissed and booed the
eity legislators.

During the noon hour some of the women distributed
leaflets in the City Hall and on the surrounding streets: in
the downtown Civic Center.

At 1:00 PM, the wonfén, whose numbers had by that
time been reduced to 125, massed in the patio of the. Los
Angeles City Board of Education, 450 North Grand Avenue,

Los. Angeles. Sissons, Wright.and Tomash addressed-the --- -.-
assembled demonstrators, pointing out that money spent in
Vietnam could be better spent in education. Vrignt claimed
that many of the so-called student "drop-outs" are in reality
"push-outs", claiming that she herself was one of the latter.
She said, We need books, not bombs. We know this is a racist
war and we blacks are.not going to fight a racist war", She - «4
indicated ‘that rather than-fight overseas,.the black people ~

sen asl dt atten

would remain at home and fight the racists She also said,
"Just because I'm pro-plack doesn't necessarily mean I'm anti-.
white. :

Wright said, "I'm not political, put I am honest. I
can't honestly get up and say the pledge of allegiance to the
American flag, because I really don't have liberty and justice;
so I just get up and stand and won't repeat the pledge.

Later, when she observed a photograph of President Johnson
hanging from a wall in the Administration Building at the
Los Angeles City Board of Education, she told the JRB women
with her, ,"We shouldn't have to look at such pornographic
pictures. |

Manual Arts High School disturbance, had at least one bright

The speeches in the patio ended at 1:30 PM and many
of the women left immediately. Seventy-eight women remained -

by some of the School Board members. They were informed by a
member of the administrative staff-that the public meeting of the
School Board would not be held until 4:00 PM, the regularly
scheduled meeting time.. The women milled around in the hallway
outside the meeting room, until finally a staff member came out
and told them that two members’ of the School Board, Reverend
James E, Jones and Dr, Julian. Nava, had agreed to grant them an
audience, The women were then ushered into the public board
room of the School Board where they waited until 2:00 PM at
which time the above-named Board members granted the demonstrators
a short audience and answered some questions put to them by the
women. One question, as to how mucn longer the members of the
School -Board were going to permit recruiters’ from the armed -
forces to interview students at local- high schools and junior
colleges remained unanswered, but Dr. Nava pointed out to the
women that he had seen nothing wrong in entering the armed
forces to fight for this country hinself when he was 17 years
of age, and he could see nothing wrong in other young men who

The Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW)
was cited as a Communist front by the House Committee on
Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 12, 1947.
in the same house report, "The Southern Patriot" was cited
as an "organ" of the SCHW.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW dated
April 26, 1946, changed its name to the Southern Conference
Educational Fund, Incorporated (SCEF) and stated’its purpose
to be to improve the educational and cultural standards of
the Southern people in accordance with the highest
Awerican democratic institutions, traditions and ideals.

The masthead of the April, 1967, issue of
"The Southern Patriot" indicates that it is the publication
of SCEF, editorial and business offices of which are
located at 3210 West Broadway, Louisville, Kentucky,
Eastern office of which is located at Suite 412, 799
Broadway, New York City. New York. "The Southern Patriot"
is published once each month, except Tuly. SEF is stated
to pe dedicated to ending discrimination based on race,
ereed, color, sex, national origin ox economic condition.

Carl Braden is identified as Executive Director
oi SCEF and Anne Braden as editor of “ihe Soutkerm Patriot."

Mrs. Alberta Ahearn, 2311 Payne Street, Louisville,
Kentucky, a self-admitted former member of the Communist
Party €CP), Louisville, Kentucky, testified on December 11,

continued as an independent organization, rallying support
for integration and democracy and helping to stimulate

and nurture new movements of the early 1960's. The SCEF
maintained headquarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but
in 1966 moved its headquarters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A source advised on March 2,° 1961, that Claude
Lightfoot, a Communist Party functionary, stated at a meeting
of the Communist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,
1961, that the Communist Party is not connected with any
progressive movement but indirectly they do have -some influence
in the SCEF. :

A second source, who is familiar with some phases
of Communist Party activity in the New Orleans area, advised
on June 3, 1966, that during the time that the SCHW was in
existence, members of the Communist Party were members of
and worked actively in the SCHW; however, since the formation
of the SCEF, Communist Party members have not been encouraged
to work in the SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is
a progressive, liberal organization, which he considers a
Communist Party front organization because it has gone along
with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly
on the racial issue.

A third source advised on May 25, 1965, that
George Meyers, a Communist Party functionary, expressed
great admiration for Carl and Anne Braden and the SCEF,
with which they are affiliated, and expressed the view
that the SCEF is the best organization in the South as far
as doing effective work is concerned and that they have a
better idea of what they are doing, where they are heading,
and influence other organizations for the better.

The second source also advised on June 3, 1966,

that many people who are officials and supporters of the
SCEF, while liberal in their views, are by no means Communists.

aes FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned

“What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced the
formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC
intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to
neutralize the distorted American press,

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and Taber
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the
| first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party(SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the past
year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to
minimize the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC
so that their influence as of May, 1963, was neeligible.

The SWP has been designated, pursuant to Executive
Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source sivised that Vincent

"Tea" Lee, FPCC National Office Director, was then formulating
FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no intention of
permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any other organization,
This source stated that Lee believed that the ¥CC should. 7
advocate resumption of diplomatic relations between Cuba and

the United States and should support the ri t of
Cubans to manage their revolution without
other nations. Lez <id not advocate suppor
revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York Times"
reported that Sen Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut had called
FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of the Castro network
in the United States." It is to be noted that Senator Dodd was

a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which

twice conducted hearings on the FPCC. a

‘TTTEE (CONT'D) e

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York World

.egram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro FPCC
was seeking to go out of business and that its prime activity
during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-Castro street
rallies and masspicket lines, and the direction of an active
propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns.
Its comparatively brief span of life was attributed to mounting
anti-Castro American public opinion, the 1962 Congressional
hearings which disclosed FPCC financing by Castro's United
Natiors Delegation, and ultimately, the bad publicity which
the FPCC received from disclosure of activities on its behalf
by suspected presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned second
source advised that V. T, Lee had recently remarked that the
FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to organize another
Simiiar organization. .

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that there
had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that the
FPCC had been dissolved.

SUDITH MORSE-FATON of Connecticut; and E:.EANOR FRENCH of New

said police would plant two hundred “agent provocateurs" in

arrests. It was also stated police had prepared for five
hundred arrests; that all telephones into the demonstration
headquarters were being monitored; and that permission to
march was still being withheld. After the California group
had been briefed, the following instructions were read to
the Washington delegates by MALVINA REYNCLDS of California:

(1) Maintain silence throughout the march.

(2) Maintain strict discipline; walk to the right
on the sidewalk.

: (3) Follow the instructions of monitors in blue
armbands who will be under orders from white arm-banded marshals.

TAIMI HALONEN and THORUN ROBEL were miidiy self-
critical about not working for the programs the younger women
were promoting. TAIMI said she was tired after working long
hours on the Seattle conference to be held Saturday, January
20th at Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle at which the
Seattle delegation would report. HALONEN made the observation,
however, that the women working on the program were all very
experienced leaders and she trusted they would formulate a
satisfactory program.

On Monday, January 15, 1968, the delegates including
the group from Washington State, met at the Union Station in
Washington, D.C. It was learned here that the instructions
which had been given the day before at the Shoreham Hotel were
evidently for the California group only, because many California
people had been badiy beaten in previous demonstrations and
they were very cautious and somewhat apprehensive. The
official pattern was different. Mimeographed sheets headed
“Jearrette Rankin Brigade - Information and Instructions" were
passed out and these appeared to be the official instructions.
A vepreduction is attached.

re -
The Washington State delegation was enlarged when a

CKUP from Tacoma arrived. RADER said some of the money
usually received from wealthy contributors had been collected

by Mrs. BACKUP. Reverend HAROLD-BASS of Tacoma collected

$120.00, and wanted scmeone else to go instead of ZEFRA = = - 7"
(STUDAMIRE). RADER defended herself when TAIMI HALONEN criticized
her for bringing ZEFRA along since ZEFRA is at least six months

pregnant.

After the demonstration, HEALY and RADER spent much
of the time urging the speakers to include in their talks some-
thing about the status of the American Indian. ELLA BAKEX from

. New York did 1nciude a paragraph from the ‘paper the Washington.

State delegation-submitted to Congress. This was entitled,
"American Indians and the Struggle for Peace". It had been
prepared by LONNIE HEALY although at its bottom it carried the
notation "(Prepared by the Jeannette Rankin Brigade Delegation
from Washington State)."

RADER,- HEALY, and CORR became indignant because the
audience did not give a standing ovation to Mrs. MARTIN L. KING,
Jr. or any of the Negro speakers.

HEALY expressed great dissatisfaction with the
basic organization of the gathering. She wanted an organi-
zational meeting instead of a rally type meeting which
occurred. HALONEN and ROBEL agreed somewhat. HEALY implied
the whole thing was a waste of her time.

In the workshop section of the meeting, HALONEN
worked in the legislative action section; HELEN FRENCH and
ELAINE HORSLEY in the electoral campaigns; and HEALY and
CORR in racism. Here, too, the younger women were very
epitical. HEALY, particularly, resented having men as
"pesource people" for the group. She said she thought this
was a women's congress. TAIMI said she found herself in a
situation that was quite different in that she was working
with a very broad spectrum of politically and economically oriented
individuals and it was a real learning experience.. ELAINE
HORSLEY was anxious to get back home and work for peace while
the spirit of JEANNETTE RANKIN was still fresh. She and
HELEN FRENCH expressed the view the congress met the needs
of American women in giving a concrete program on which to work.

Tuesday,’ January 16, 1968, was for lobbying. The
Seattle and Tacoma people were told to meet at the Methodist
Building, 100 Maryland Avenue. HALONEN, ROBEL, HEALY, HORSLEY,
and HELEN FRENCH arrived before the appointed time. After about
an hour, EMELIA CASSIDY arrived stating RADER had an eye problem
and would be unable to attend. Mrs. BACKUP joined the group.
LINDA CORR and ZEFRA were too tired to get up so early. The
group called on Washington State's Senators JACKSON and MAGNUSON,
but they were not in their offices. After leaving a copy of
1 the women's petition and a questionnaire prepared by the
! Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (see attachment)
: they called on Washington State's Congressmen FLOYD HICKS and
: BROCK ADAMS, Mr, HICKS was out of town. Mrs. HORSLEY knew the:
‘Congressman personally and her ‘son’ knew two of the office See EE Ces
personnel. She asked that they relate to him that she was ca :
vitally interested in peace and social justice.

Congressman BROCK ADAMS was in his office and spent
about twenty minutes talking with the group concerning his
political views and some of the political machinations of his
party. The group then began to disintegrate. ELAINE HORSLEY
left to get a 2:30 flight to Boston where she would visit her
son who is attending Harvard University.

After some sightseeing in the afternoon, HALONEN,

they were going to stay a day or two .onger for some workshops.
RADER stayed also. The rest of the group, HEALY, CORR, ZEFRA
(STUDAMIRE), CASSIDY, and FRENCH went to Friendship Airport
and boarded UAL Flight 41 for Seattle.
While in Washington, HEALY kept trying to call a

MARJORIE RADER got an eye infection which kept her from going to

troubles might be attributed to the fact STUDAMIRE is expecting
a baby in April. CASSIDY stated there were teo many rules to
follow.

The delegates weren't premitted to carry a nail file,
wear peace buttons, or exhibit RANKIN buttons. They had to walk
six abreast and were not allowed to march around the White
House. She said a suit will be brought in court for this
denial of their raghts. She went on to state each person had
or was given $10.00 to carry on his person so he could not
be arrested for vagrancy.

CASSIDY said a nurse, Mrs. HELEN MzcCOGK, had been
very helpful to the group. COOK told CASSIDY ‘she could be reached
at 719 Beechwood Road, Media, Pennsylvania, if more information
is desired concerning Veterans for Peace, which was not further
described.

GUY RADER, a CP member at this meeting, tried to stop
CASSIDY when the latter complained ZEFRA STUDAMIRE was too
ammature to have been sent to the conference, but CASSIDY wasn't
easy to stop. She was incensed over the fact money had been used
for STUDAMIRE's trip and the latter refused to cooperate. RADER
and STUDAMIRE remained in Washington, D.C. after the conference
to handle some business with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating =
Committee (SNCC) according to CASSIDY.

i-t and violenc because it pictures a white man hitting an «narmed
aAwith a rif'e bute. Some Indian youth view the television program
we of raciat America. The National Congress of American
of Indians

custer® as indsc
Iadians opposes cnis distortion of hiscory. Beatings and murder
sa iiaine go unchallenged. Congress voted in 195 to open up Indian land
¥eservations to state jurisdiction, In actuality, this rides established
tribal courts and federal jurisdiction. It gives local bigoted authorities
more opportunity to harrass and open the way to termination of our treaties
and in several places resulted in actual loss of land.

It is as deadly to be an Indian in America as it is to be a soldier
in Viet Nam. In the three years before 1997, more Indian children below the
age of 18 had died in this country than the 6,628 U. S. combat casualties of
the entire Viet Nam War (as of the end of 1966). Most of these were children
below the age of six.

The price we pay is the built-in racism our children are taught in
school, over television, in-cartoons; the Indian has become a joke, to white
Americans, We pay because we don't know our own history,

The thread of struggle for self-determination runs through the history
of Indian-Americans, When a few Indian youth speak of Red Power, the roots go
deep into their history in finding nourishment for this demand. Just as some
Negro leaders today speak of W.E.B, DuBois as having raised the same issue cf
identity long before the level of struggle, which is Black Power, arrived.
This struggle has gone on for 400 years,

The Indian people have been sending spokesmen to bring their grievances

“and their positions before the power structure of this country for two hundred

years. They have fought in the courts since at least 1830 when the case of
the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia tested the ability and the willingness of the
United States to protect an Indian Tribe in its efforts at self-determination.

The Vietnamese war is @ continuation of the whole racist war we have.
waged ayainst the Indian People. Understanding this is a part of understanding
the Viet Nam war. We respond to what is happening to Vietnamese children, yet
the Indian people have suffered from the same policy of extermination and Fy
destruction of their identity,

We must unite with ‘the strivings of those who have had to deal with
United States’ genocide for 200 years!

We can help to push the United States to ratify the United Nations
Resolution, "Treaty Against Genocide", that the United States should correct
the history and policy of genicide against the Indian people. Today this
refers to the destruction of their identity asa people and linke with the
struggles of people for their identity all over the world. To stop the policy
of genocide, of raciam, to develop compensatory steps to undo the effects of
the crimes against the Indian people, to remove the oppression of the Indian . |

grievances. 6

ue
Upon informing the Capitol Police of their planned march to the Capitol puilding
to present their petition, the wenen wer: threatened with arrest under 40 U.S.C.

193 (a) et. seq. which, after defining the area ccusidercd Copitol Grounds, states:|

"It is forbidden to parade, stand, or move in processions

or assemblages in said United States Capitol Grounds, or to,
display therein any flag, banner, or device designed or i
adapted to bring into public notice any party, organization, _
or movement......"

The statute further provides that exceptions from these prescriptive provisions
will be made in the discretion of certain Congressional leaders and/or Capitol
Police. The exceptions are allowed on “ocassions of national interest becoming
the congnizance and entertainment of Congress."

,
The petition of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade apparently does not become "the
entertainment of Congress" and arrests were threatened. Therefore the suit which
was files prays for the convening of a three-judge Federal District Court which
is requested to enjoin the operation and enforcement of the statute and to ~
declare it unconstitutional, We have asked the Federal District Court for the
District of Columbia to grant us this relief on an emergency basis prior to
January 15th. Our request was denied. The same request was made to the District |
of Columbia Court of Appeais and was likewise denied. As it was then impossible
to obtain relief prior to January 15th the Brigade's attorneys are continuing the
appeal on a non-emergency basis in the Court of Appeals and have every confidence
of ultimate victory. ;

This is far from the last time that these women or any other Americans intend
to appear in their nation's Capitol to petition their government. Hopefully this |

will be the last time that they find it so difficult to do so.

term Welfare programs in the United States began with passage of
-ne Eccinl Security Acty--in 1935, authorizing federal gran
states for public ansistance and child welfare progra:

the Washington Legiclsivre remcaled the Paupers Law o!
enactcd a State Social Security Law. "Welfare" hus teen a bone of
a contention ever since.

Greenleirh Report woe ‘

In 1963, the Washington Legislature a oprlated $20,000 for a study
of the statets public assistance programs. The study was made by
Greenleigh Associates, and the Greenleigh Report was presented in
December, 1964, °

This report stated that public assistance grants in

Washington, with standar s based on 1959 prices and

12% ratable reductions,t.* te 40% below the minimum

Standards for health and decency, Speaking of child ’

welfare needs, the report said:"There 1s an excessive

and increasing rate of referral of children to the

Juvenile Courts, both for dependency and delinquency.

There is an excessive and increasing trend for children

to be removed from their natural families and cared

for elsewhere,"

WHAT ABOUT RATABLE REDUCTIONS?

The 1965 Legislature removed the ratable reductions, The 1967
Legislature ordered the Dept. of Public Assistance to bring itts
pricing standard's up to 1967 levels,

New standards were put into effect July first. Increased allowances
for rent vary from county to county. Other allowances were increased
an average of 10-3/4%.«In King County the total increase was 16%.
Thus, Kang County grants have been increased by 28% since 1964,
but the cost of living has increased by at least 5%. Grants are stil
17% less than acceptable levels,

The maximum grant for a Seattle family consisting of

two adults, a boy 13, and a girl 8, is $285.80 a

month--$3,429 a year. But recent changes in the

Federal Social Security Law cast a shadow on even

this figure. The local welfare officials will not

offer any puess os to whot mov harmon next. NEW RATABLE

REDUCTIONS ARH ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY,

There is much talk of getting people off welfare by putting them to
work. Yet who will take care of the children? Child care costs fro.

$60 to $80 per child per month in Seattle. :

WORKERS WORLD PARTY

On April 17, 1959, a confidential source advised
that on February 12, 1959, a Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
minority group under the leadership of National Committee
member SAM BALLAN, split from the SWP. .

The source stated that this minority ground,
veferred to as the Marcyites, after many years of program
and policy differences on varied issues concerning tactics
and interpretation of political events, split from the SWP
on the grounds that the Party was liquidating itself by
departing from the Marxist precepts of LEON TROTSKY and
retreating from the fight for the world socialist
revolution. The final issue which ultimately forced the
split was the minority's ovposition to the SWP vregroupment
policy which involved cooperation with the Communist Party
(CP) periphery-individuals characterized by the minority
as petty-bourgeois,

The minority program, according to the source,
advocated unconditional defense of the Soviet Union and has
as its goal the building of a revolutionary party with a
complete proletarian orientation for the purpose of overthrowing
capitalism in the United States and throughout the world,

On May 12, 1960, source advised that this minority
‘group had chosen the name ianniiil World Party.

on May 1, 1867, a second confidential source
advised that the Workers World Party, which maintains head- .
quarters at 46 West 21st Street, New York, New York, supports
the People's Republic of China in its idedlogical dispute
with the Soviet Union.

The SWP and CP have been designated
pursuant to Executive Order 10450,
