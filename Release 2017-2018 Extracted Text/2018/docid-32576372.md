NOTE: The above-mefitioned LA informant who is a veteran member

of M Cosa Nostra has been told by the LA Family underboss Nick
Licata that Frank Desimone, the LA Family boss, and the leader
representing smaller Cosa Nostra groups in the Western parts of the
US with the Commission, is to be in NYC on 1-25-65, to meet with
the commission. This presumably will pertain to recent commission
action against the Joseph Bonanno Family and according to informant
may possibly pertain to the reorganization of this family which

is now under commission trusteeship. Inasmuch as. Desimone will be
expected to alert other Cosa Nostra leaders in the Western part

of the US representing smaller groups, some of whom may be relatively
unknewn, it will be valuable to afford coverage to Desimone's
movements to and from NYC. Inasmuch as past experience with
Desimone has shown him to be extremely surveillance conscious,

and has determined that he will avoid planned contacts if he is
aware of surveillance, Aaah Peta ater ane ist be used in covering

his movements. conn
