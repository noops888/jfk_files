Lo noma

ma has been under my supervision as Deputy and

Case Uffice: for approximatoly fifteen months. Based on the knowledge of

han as an Individual gained during this perlod and upon his actual

perfomance, I recommand that he be entered for consideration on the SR

Division CS-1, to CS-15 promotion list at this time • Juce 195%.

The slot

and job which be now occuples, Chief, Soviet Branch, Is, of coursa, adequate

to accormodate

such a promotion.

Sioperational performance has been outstanding and

notably versatile during this period. Ho has engaged primarily in liaison

and has beer personally effective in terms of rasults achioved almost dally,

In terms of reports, operational data, and Joint enterprise; while, overall

he has established enduring professional relationships from which tho

organization as a mole should bensilt for some time to come

In addition,

owing In largo part to unique personal talents, linguistic and otherwise,

sate has handed a nunber of unilateral cases nost effectively.

the office, too, as well as in face-to-face operational situations, stee

has been custanding, He has a flair for and a facility with the written word

as evidenced by the amount of general and particular correspondence which ha

subordimies to take care of, in Itself, the beginning of any good supervisory

rolatlonship. In actual fact, he has. had considerable experience in this

regard alreade and the principal shortcoming I have noticed 13 a tendency to

"carry" othars by an extension of his on industry. hinth is not without

his difficulties in tha area of personal relationships.

He is a purist at

times and ranifestly impationt in certain human situations where a shrug of

the shouliers would be the best reply.

These characteristics do not always

make for the best personal relationships but are frequently obriated by.

In sum;

We qualifications, broäd experience and proven

at this time..

It 1s therefore ny sincere recommendation that a promotion'
