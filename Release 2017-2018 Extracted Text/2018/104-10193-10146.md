to ovurtarov Cestro, to uulte the various Cuven exile quigs snd to
crese laws for the effective reconstruction of Cuba. Hembership ts
conprised of. individaal businessuea rather than reprecentatives of
large orgentzet ions.

2. The comittee hed been meeting with various iuited States
officials in Veekington, D. C., to express ite views. Ite mnbers
are worried over Cestro propagasda, wich, although untrue, has becn
accepted es fact, 1.e., twenty thousend killings by Betista and the
cloin thet Castro's wes a social revolution rather than a political
ong. ‘they polated out that the Cuban econory woo forserly prospering
