reports he is a member of the Ameijeiras group and
is a good and brave man,

(2) Antonio Lusson y Batlle, Chief of Operations

beard nothing bad about Iusson,

(3) Cudte, Raul Diaz Arguelles, Chief of
Artillery of the Occidental ‘ray.

(4) EBlpidio Baex Bigo. According to AMLASH-1,
Baez is a trusted Fidelman. :

(5) Luis Manuel Cantillo Toirac. Assigned to
the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and one of the security

people. He was forsierly assigned to Brazil, is young

and has for several years been with Pinero and the
Cuban 18.

(6) Enrique Oltuski Osacki. Oltuski is a cloge

friend of Faustino Perez and his stock eith the regine

rises or falls as does that of Faustino.

(7) Sergio Totlon, Code clerk in the Enbassy in

Paris. Tollon is staying in Paris at the request of
Ambassador Carrillo.

1. Gastro enteritis, water pollution and unsanitary
conditions. AMLASH-1 states there are no real problems,
although the scarcity and lack of a balanced diet do
cause some problems, The purification of vater has been

a problem which probably has been the cause of some of the

g@ickness in the country.

a.
im to fly back to Havana with him in order to get hin

ack beacause of any serious security matter. AMIASH-1

did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not

return to Cuba, Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-? for his

trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH-1 does

not defect and returns to Cuba. ANLASH-1 feele Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH~1
decides to stay out.

AMLASH-1 was unable to provide any information on

id-November and

a.
the political developments in Cuba in

December aince he had been out of the country since early

November. AMLASH-1 was asked to check on the probleus

between the opposing factions in the Cuban leadership and

explained the issues, the background and personalities
involved,

°,

AMLASH-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited

Soviet advise or influence in political and economic
matters creates resentment among the middle and higher level
Cuban offtetats. Basically, the Soviets are not respected,

p. Rank of Cuban officials under Fidel tn terns of
their influence in making national: policy. Raul is etili
the heir apparent to Fidel. Next to Raul. $6 Che Guevara.
After that, no other official, according to AMLASH-1, has
any gréat influence in the making of Cuban national policy.
President Dorticcs' relationship with Fidel is good since
he is a hard and serious ‘worker, has good sdainistrati'
ability and is able to work within the genoral outline laid
down: by Fidel. Raul Castro has some political tnfluence
and. ¢ontrol ip Oriente where he has placed his men in
positions ‘of ‘influence, but only Fidel personally has eny
poktical influence in the rest of Cuba. Even within the
1 satects.and appoints high .aray officera. -..
Che Guevart :@ti1l strong in the ecoromic field and
has ‘not suffered a decline in his influence and authority
because of his earlier policy of industrialization.
Gdéevara restricts himself to the economic field and plays
® very small role in the political field. He is serious
and very bard worker, one of the fev, according to AMLASH-1,
who has worked seven days a week without leave since the
revolution. Emilio Aragones holds an important position
as the organizational secretary of the PURS. He is the
official who was always at the office of the National
Directorate of the Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime. He plays an important coordinating
role, Faure Chomou has been accused of organizing former
13th of March Revolutionary Directorate people, but,
according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Choron always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
people, Because of this Chomon today controls to a large
degree the Ministry of Transportation, Of all the ministries,
the DR's stronghold is in the Ministry of Transportation,
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions
in the regime are Alberto Mora, Ambassador Carrillo and

Jose Naranjo.

q. AHLASH-1 and AMWHIP-1 were unable to develop any
specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
welcome a transfer from the Embassy 10 Paris to the
Embassy in Madrid.

r. According to Eatlio Aragones, Anibal Escalante
is being considered for a job outside Cuba, The job will
probably be in the commercial/ecdnomic field, but a
Gectsion had not been made as of November 1964 as to

location.

_- gpsigned to the commercial section of the

x bé ised as an tnduderent. Ambassador Carrillo,
t £f the proper person developed him, could
‘tobably be compromised with Fidel. He is a character
and could easily be entangled according to AMLASH-1 in
a compromising situation. Ambassador Carrillo is a close
friend of Lucy Echevarria.

2, AMLASH-1 was also asked information on a long list
of other requirements on Cuba. On many he.was unable to pro-
vide information and cables vere sent to Hoadquarters on the
requirements on which he did provide information.
