:lena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents ir

sanetezed

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917. Ms. Garro attended

the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later

did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the

University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married

to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest, poets and leading intellectuals. When

Octavia was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also

named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early

life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity

about her native land and had a reputation for being one

if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena

was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of

Mexican life and made an important contribution to its

artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El' Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

splendid success." Critics have said of her: "For

Elena Garro, there is no frontier between reality and

fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality--

perhaps more intense-- to which one may penetrate without

passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of

a literature fired with passion, flavor and life.

Many

The mas

people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier

between reality and fantasy is also difficult for her to

distinguish in real life.

(ibid)

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campisina (CNC), the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI) • Because Ms. GarrO

was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the

poorer Mexican

peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all

over the country tr

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important

social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been

friendly with Embassy officers. Her broad range of signifi-

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target. Through-

out the early 1960's she was carried as a target in the

The memo reported that Elena Garro de Paz, her daughter

and Deba Garro de Guerrero Galvan discussed meeting Oswald

in Mexico in the fall of 1963. The discussion was, reportedly,

sparked by the newspaper coverage given the Warren Report.

Elena and Deba are the first cousins of Horatio, Ruben

and Lynn Duran. Elena, her daughter and Deba were invited

to a "twist party" at the home of Ruben Duran. The party

The Garro's claimed that they had recognized Oswald's

photograph when it was published after the assassination.

The arrest of Silvia Duran "underlined their certainty"

that the man had been Oswald. (IBID.)

Deba added that Lynn and one of the Duran brothers

had made trips to Texas.

She also said that, even though

they were always poor before the assassination, they were

both driving expensive new cars. A notation on the memo

with him.

He was apparently quite smitten with the

daughter and tried to call her on several occasions after

the party.

The daughter did not take the calls and as

were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran party,

few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexican girl

who had recently returned from living in France. He was

unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it was

probably early in September because of a heavy rain which

occurred as they were leaving the party about 2:00 a.M.

(IBID. p. 4)

Lavagnini noted no Americans present at this party.

He was familiar with the appearance of Lee Harvey Oswald

because of publicity following the assassination of President

Kennedy but otherwise had no knowledge of him and had never

seen him except for news photographs following the assassina-

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer

at the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a

conversation with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587,

WX-7241 Entry No. 425, P. 91, CIA No. 718.) The meeting

with Elena had been about other matters but she mentioned

knowing Oswald. Thomas noted that she was reluctant to

Negro?"

Elena also told Thomas that she had later learned

under the pretext that they were in danger. Elena

claimed to have told Calvillo that she wanted to tell

her story to the American Embassy. Calvillo dissuaded

her by telling her that the American Embassy was full

of Communist spies. Elena said that some of the other

people who had been at the party were taken to Veracruz

where they were "protected" by Governor Lopez Arias.

She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly "protected" by

General Clark Flores, was very prosperous and was driving

a big car.

to anything she and Elenita said" (Ibid.)

She stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's

home. She was unclear about the date of the party. It

was a few days before the Soviet Astronaut, Gagarin,

visited Mexico; she thought that this would put the party

around September 2 or 3, 1963. She believed that the party

was on a Monday or Tuesday because it was an odd night for

a party.

The memo noted that September 1 and 2 were

indeed a Monday and Tuesday. Elena could not check her

calender to refresh her memory at the time of the interview

because the calender was in a desk that had been stored

away -

During the conversation, Elena described Oswald

and his companions. The man who she thought was Oswald

wore a black sweater. She said he was quiet "and stared a

lot at the floor." One of his companions "was very tall

and slender and had long blond hair which hung across his

forehead. He had a

gaunt face and a rather long protruding

chin." The other companion was also tall, with short,

light brown hair and no really distinguishing characteristics.

The three Americans did not dance or mix with the other

guests.

Elena saw the same three men on the street the

next day. (IBID.)

Elena was certain that Eusebio Azcue, Horacio Duran,

memo reported that Elena said that Victor Rico Galan had

told her that Eusebio Azcue was "one of the most powerful

men in Cuba." Elena said

that Azcue was a Spanish Cuban

who had fought in the spanish Civil war and, by his own

admission, had served at that time as a French intelligence

agent.

The above mentioned memo is, attached to a State

On February 3, 1966 Anne Goodpasture sent Thomas'

them to check whether Elena was "seen creating such a

disturbance as they claimed in front of the Cuban

Embassy. "

(Note from Ann Goodpasture to "Cubans",

ambassy were queried about this. (IBID.) That there are

no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed that the

event happened: 1. on a Saturday at 3:00 p.m. when

the Cuban Embassy was not normally photographically

surveilled; and

2.) the "disturbance" occured inside the

Cuban compound. HSCA Examination of the CIA Cuban Embassy

photographic surveillance showed no surveillance on 11/23/63.

(Classified Summary of Staff Review of CIA Documents,

On 2/23/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to the

Ambassador regarding the Garros allegations. (Memo from

Legat to Ambassador, 2/23/66, CIA #571; WX-7241 Entry #455,

p. 95, CIA #722.) This memo reports that "extensive investi-

Mexico prior to September 26, 1963 and that no information

had developed that would show that he had not been in

New Orleans in the early part of that month. The memo

repeated that no further action was being taken by the

FBI because her allegations had not been substantiated.

A marginal comment by this entry in wx-7241 says,

No further reports on Elena's story were generated

until 1969 when Charles Thomas was "selected out."

("Selected out" is a phrase used when an officer is retired

after having been in one

grade for the maximum period of

time and is not considered qualified for promotion to a

higher grade). Then, he wrote a letter and memorandum

letter, Mr. Thomas also writes, "whereas the FBI has

discounted Elena Garro's allegations, the CIA is still

considerably disturbed by them." (IBID.) The Legat's

office in response wrote that/Alan White from the CIA had

indicated that he was aware of Elena's unreliability.

(FBI report, 9/30/69, p. 7, JFK Document No.

The Legat's office further wrote that the concept that

every person who passes on to another government agency

information relating to matters within the jurisdiction

of that agency has the responsibility and authority

to review and evaluate the action taken by that agency

is, of course, untenable. (IBID.)
