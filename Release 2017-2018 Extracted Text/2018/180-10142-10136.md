Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in

Biography

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917.. Ms. Garro attended
the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later
did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the
University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married
to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who.is also one of
Mexico's finest, poets and leading intellectuals. When
Octavia was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple
separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also
named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early
life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity
about her native land and had a reputation for being one
if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena
was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of
Mexican life and made an important contribution to its
artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El’ Rey Mago, La Senora _en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,
where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.
Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, “a

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campisina (CNC), the agrarian
arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro
was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the
Poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms
with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all
over the ey) Cbd)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated
woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright
opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers
in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political
connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-
attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

had made trips to Texas. She also said that, even though
they were always poor before the assassination, they were

conversation with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587,

with Elena had been about other matters but she mentioned

to anything she and .Elenita said" (Ibid.)

She stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's

fhe

was a few days before the Soviet-Astrenaut, Gagarin,

[ home. She was unclear about the date of the party. It

visited Mexico; she thought that this would put the party
around September 2 or 3, 1963. She believed that the party
was on a Monday or Tuesday because it was an odd night for
a party. The memo noted that September 1 and 2 were

indeed a Monday and Tuesday. Elena could not check her
calender to refresh her memory at the time of the interview
because the calender was in a desk that had been stored
away.

During the conversation, Elena described Oswald
and his companions. The man who she thought was Oswald
wore a black sweater. She said he was quiet “and stared a
lot at the floor." One of his companions "was very tall
and slender and had long blond hair which hung across his
forehead. He had a gaunt face and a rather long protruding
chin." The other companion was also tall, with short,
light brown hair and no really distinguishing characteristics.
“he three americans did not dance or mix with the other
guests. Elena saw the same three men on the street the
next day. (IBID.)
Elena was certain that Eusebio Azcue, Horacio Duran,

Silvia Duran, Lydia Duran, Deba Guerrero, General Clark

to review and evaluate the action taken by that agency

is, of course, untenable. (IBID.)
