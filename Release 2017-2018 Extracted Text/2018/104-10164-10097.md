1. Forwarded herewith is a Xerox copy of the Costa Rican.
jassport used by Orlando BOSCH to enter the Dominican Republic
n the name cf Carlos Luis PANIAGUA Mendez. The passport was

obtained and Xeroxed by. EMCLIPPER-1 who provided a copy to the

2, EMWISE+15-had previously reported that BOSCH entered the
Dominican Republic with a false Costa Rican passport in the name of
Pedro Anzonio PENA. While BOSCH may be carrying a second. Costa.
Rican passport in the PENA name, it appears that he entered the
Dominican Republic with the PANIAGUA passport, The PANIAGUA
passport forwarded herewith shows the following:

A, The Department of Migration of Costa Rica issued a
visa on 24 March 1976 for travel to "C.A., Republica
Dominicana" (p.13).

B. BOSCH departed Costa Rica at Pena Blancas on 26 March
(p. 11) and entered Nicaragua (p. 9). -

iasiains C, ‘The Dominican Consulate in Managua issued a@ one-trip

E. BOSCH arrived in Santo Domingo at Las Americas

3. BOSCH told EMCLIPPER-1 that the real PANIAGUA had undertaken
most of the travel shown in the passport, but EMCLIPPER-1 did not
establish the date the passport was acquired by BOSCH or how. #

4, AS reported Ref A, BOSCH was deported to Costa Rica via
Managua on 29 August on Iberia Flight 979.  EMWISE-15 reported that
the PANIAGUA passport was used to deport BOSCH. .
