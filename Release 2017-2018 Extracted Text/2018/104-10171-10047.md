 Teade¥ of this group, arrived clandestinely in Cuba in Qotebor or
November 1960 and began to organize the various groups of,Mirectorate to
bring about an insurrection in tho Side Unostra area, in Oriente Province.
These groups were mainly from the province? of Las Villas and Havana, and
received orders to unite with Muller who was already in the Siegra sestra.
The men went there in small groups, and had the seminary in the Santuario
del Cobre as their destination. Once in that spot, they received final
instructions and military equipment. Souroe's group, which consisted of two
carloads, entered the Sierra Maestra through Bayamo. Source was. riding in
the first oar. When they arrived on thy outskirts of Bayamo, source's car
was stopped by the militia, but the oar way allowed tO pass without any
check. A few minutes later they realized that they were being rollowed and
tried to escape. An alara and shots went up, ‘and they were finally captured
and taken prisoner. Tae second oar, which wie following close behind then
and was warned by the chcts, was able to escape.

Of the tuller croup, which wae called the "127", about UO prisoners were
taken, five of whom, including vource, were set free. One of thece wa
an infiltrator called Flores, whom no one trusted since they knew that,
he wou not “one of the group.". Another of these wus Rolando Valdés
Delf who ia now in prison in the Fortaleza de 1a Cabafia serving a nine~
yoar sentence. ‘He was captured trying to escape ina cer celonging to a
militiuman and wearin; a militia uniform. He defended: himself bravely, but
eived five bullet wounds which incapacitated him. The other two who
wero’ released were Eduardo Diaz Lanz and Jorge Crus Peiie, @ sergeant in
the Rebel Amy who waa with Castro in the Sierra. Tho letter hud actually
not been involved in the groups Source thought that he (source) and bias
Lant wore released so that they’ might be followed and lead the Government
to other groups and individuals in Havana who might be involved in
Fesistance activity. Source had been in prieon six months tefore being
released, and one thing which he could not explain was that on the paper
that he wae given which indicated hie release, no mention was made of sny

sentence or penalty.

On several occasions, Miller hed been subjected to false execution

procédures, with the purpose of trying to make him talk, but he did not
weaken. During the trial, "everyone remained firm," and source was told
that Muller was very bravo in his pronouncements against the Hegime and,
at every moment,: abided by his principles. He presented a very brilliant

self-defense.

When source was in the Boniato prison, he shared a cell with a Captain
An{bal Rodr{,uez, who belonged to the LKR. This officer, salon with other
rebel officers and soldiers, hud’ staged an uprising in Imias, in Oriente
Province. Later he was sentenoed to deatii and shot.

During his last days in Cuba, source avoided all revolutionzry activity,
since he wanted to leave Cuba more than anything else. However he knew
that the various resistance groups worked hard, carrying out e great deal -
of independent sabotage activity, although there was not auch coordination
among ‘the various:.movements. One movement which had a.large membership,
especially in Orients Provincey-was the U-30-Il. Thio group was planning to
launch an insurrection in Pinar del Rio in January 1962, but taey could
not carry it‘out since the repression in the area was so great.

Hans, @ uomber of the Revolutionary Student Directorate, was recently
taken prisoner, and it seemed that he was tortured a yreat deal and

ized and armo and gelatina were fount. The owners of the house and other
persons yere arrested.
