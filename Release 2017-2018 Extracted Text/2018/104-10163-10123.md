that support to Artine amd his movement be. resumed ca ® smaller -

scale and for a‘totally distinc:, psychological warfare purpone.

“3. Artimse's cooperation with CIA in the liquidation of

egteee pean

Ris paramilitary organization was exemplary, indicating his

cognition that his long range interests are dest eerved by

Gooperation with the United States Governmeut even though, as

bas sometimes happened, our objectives and those of bis move~

nt may conflict in the short run, dig _Pooperaisve attitude -

as exemplified in ca! case points up the potential long rang

efulness to our government of him and his organization, tha

“Several factors are important in dauagtag Artine’

sar flat tance icance at present iil the

‘
:



though inadequate, was nonetheless the most aggressive and
large scale effort conducted by any exile organization. ofr
even more long range importance, perhaps, is the fact that

, Artime and the MRR have represented since 1958 an effort at i

democratic, Catholic-oriented reform within Cuba--one which
originally allied itself with Castro as long as he appeared
anti-communist, but broke with him as soon as his communiat
" connections becase evident. Artine himself was an important
“-Yéeter in the field of agricultural reform in the early days
of the Castro regime, when he was de facto chief of the
: agricultural reform program in Oriente Province. Here he -

invented the system of “rural commandos”, i.e., groups of

students who worked in the rural areas with the less privileged
youth, teaching reading and writing, public. health and sanita-
tion, organization of cooperatives, improved agricultural

“methods, and similar sujects. (Information on his efforts

"does not, by the way, s'

only from Artime; @ large number of
“members of his movement were debriefed by CIA in 1960 when

they ‘ert Cuba. Many of them were later trained as part of

Brigade 2506 and fought in the Bay of Pigs landing.j) Thus,

- Artime has more of @ claim to a reputation se & practien? and

dealistic reformer than do many of his fellow exil

Mnally, it should be aoted that he is a natural leader.

‘a able to instill enthusiasm for his ideas in others, and

eo



organizer, he kas the virtue of being willing to delegate
authority to those more competent in this respect than he.
5. Because Artime is a bora politician and propagandist
who can be useful now, and because he has potential ag a
leader in post-Castro Cuba, CIA proposes to continue support.
ing him to the extent necessary to preserve the MRR. This
organization, which has representatives in half a Guzen tatia
American countries as well as in the United States and Spaia,
clains approximately 5000 members and sympathizers. Tt makes
radio broadcasts to Cuba from the Miami area and publishes a
~well-conceived monthly magazine, Tridente, with circulatio:
of about 6000. Finally, it supports & numbér of dependents
‘end families of killed and captured MRR members. Total CIA

expenditures under the proposed Program would be about $15,000
monthly, brokea down as follow:

To tnis end, he has had discussions with the presidents of
Colombia, Panana, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, all
of whom he claims have evinced varying degrees of interest.
Most recently, he has received an invitation to visit

_one of Barrientos’ representatives in the U.S. having heard

I am informing you of the following: ao Fret hogar oh vereate®

qth Seores-
1, According to information recheved from Guillermo Vargas,

Dear Jin:

fm San Jose, Costa Rica, who bas friends who have infiltrated the
Communist group of Marcial Aguiluz, the following is reported: i
Jt has been approximately five months that Nicaraguans and Costa
Ricans have been trained in the farm that Marcial Aguiluz owns
by Rio Claro (in EMMXKXHXME the south of Costa Rica), This training
4s given in small groups of 5 7 10, in order to be ane to hide and
go into the interior or the jungle that is there in case the
government of Costa Rica makes @ surprise inspection, They (Communists)
think that Somoza is expecting an infiltration of guerrillas from
Cuba: through the Atlantic and they plan to surprise the iicaraguan
government by infiltrating this group through the Pacific in
Nicaragua, Then as soon as the Government of Nicaragua mobilizes
BM treops towards the Pacific; Fidel will send another group
through the Atlantic, They hope to do this before the elections.

‘They hope that men who are already in Nicaragua will prepare their
arrival by creating chaos, sabotaging, and terroriam, They have
brought incendiaries =nd equipment for sabotage ante Nicaragua and it
appears that thoy heve a great cargo of arms in LEON (Nicaragua),
2, According to information from Alejandro Montero, a Costa Rican
who is married to a Cuban, the following is exported: In the
“DPONINELLY" apartments in San Jose, Costa Sica, where Alejandro
Montero lives, there also lives one Luis Campoa whe reunites. weekly
‘dn his apartment. (I think it is #& in"DONIJNELLY") with the XHMING
Communist leaders. Hanuel Mora, Dr. Durstin, Dr, Horern, and one

bring the name of the individuaz who was supposed to arrive from
Cuba,after Marcial had returned, to take charge of the Nicaraguan
business. They KXKHMEF. ( the Consunists at the meeting) assumed

that the man who would take charge could be Max Santos Pastor, a
Costa Rican, who ic now in Cuba, Montero also heard them speaking
about an interview that “ora Valverde, Marcial Aguiluz and Aguero

(an obstructionist Nicaraguan candidate in the coming presidential
elections) had, the last time that Aguero was in Costa Rica, It is
Alejandro Monteros® opinion that if Aguero is not in on the conspiracy
“then he is at least he is informed about all of it,

given to me by our Cuban agents; Mario Moya and Sergio Cabrera
who live in San Jose, Costa Rica,
4. As I was almost. ike a commissionK¥ agent for the "Scopitone, Inc.”
of Chicago, I had two XHXHENXHEN. commercial interviews with Frank
Marshall, at the last interview he told me he wanted to speak alone
with me (at both meetings there had been present two representatives
from the Scopitone co,), I made an appointment with him at the Hotel
"Costa Rica’ HMHHH where Scopitons; had a suite,

There I spoke alone with him on 12 December at 12:00 in the afternoon,

in hotel room #204, Pe
He told me that he wanted to buy arms from mq that he knew I had.

1 told him that the ones I had had in Nicaragua X had turned in to
the government (that 1s false), and that there were only some left
in other pleces_in Central America, teld him Ichad to inow i>
what cause these arms were going to bo utilized, I also told him thet
I had the moral obligation to ENHW be vigilant and see that the
Communists would not utilize them. I told him that I was not a
vendor of arms, but a revolutionary, (I talked to him about this:
trying to get information out of him, because these arms of mine are
only ior Cuba and against Castro.)

4.

He told me that he needed them for himself, that he expected a
revolutionary outburst from one moment to the next in Costa Rica
and that he didn't want his "private arsenal” to be smaller than
the ones that Calderon Guaraist!Pope Fiuecas omocn er: the
Communists had (according to him each of the aforementicned groups
bad their own arsenals). :
Y asked him when he needed these arms and he answered:NOW,
I told him I would have to take three weeks to think about and then
I would give him an answer: he answered after thinking for a while:
okay, I can give you one month to give me an answer but no more,
My opinion is that he is in a plot to overthrow the government. i
The situation in Costa Rica is very bad, for the “unhappy president does
not have a definite political group to support him, and therafore
he is in the hands of the diverse groups to advocated him: Calderon
Guardia, Ulate, Echandi, Frank Marshall, etc. these are persons who
each have a group who respond to their own sectarian interests and
not to Costa Rica, and who respond mich less to the President.

‘5, On 7 December at 4:00 3.m. I had an interview with EESKX Paniel
Oduber XHKHXEX (lawyer) in his office. (about three blecks from. the
Hotel Costa Rica). =e :
He XK spoke badly to mo about Don Pepe Figueres and "Chico Orlich",
he told that they wanted to eliminate his presidential aspirations

for the coming campaign and postulate Don Pepe again, He said that
they (Don Pepe and Orlich) were the Johnsons of Costa “ica and he was
the Kennedy.



Se t

i'm lucky, he said, that they are stupid and that they are not aware

of the fact that an attack is being created and they are not. -
prepared for that emergency, I am prepared, he told me, Then he
told mo that he had an airfield big enough for a C-46 on his farm,

elose to the border with Nicaragua, MYX<MMXNMNEEEM on the Pacific
eide, and that at the determined moment he could receive arms at
that place. He again asked for my collaboration in the case of

@ revolt in Costa Rica and he concretely asked mo that if at the

time of a revolt I would help with technicians and arms,

H 6, About Dr, Alvarez Tormo: He has stayed in contact with the
people of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. He is very worried because
these people ask for information and he does not “now what to say

c- for the contact from the Company that spoke with him in Mexico, spoke
with bim just.one time and he has not returned to speak with. him
again. He cannot find him because thoy did not leave him the necessary
signals, The people from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico paid for his
trip to the homage which was at the Basque Center that they gave the
professors of the medical faculty of Havana (Dr. Alvarez Toro was

@ professor). Dr. Alvarez Tormo was one of the speakers. This took
place the 3rd and 4th of December in Miami,
Dr, Alvarez Tormo gave them detailed information on everything that
was said at the function (by suggestion ef Don Manuel Guillot).
They have brought Dr. Alvarez Tormo trom Cuba, photographs and
letters from his relatives. (They were brought by the people from

because he is playing with his brothers life. ! think that his
work can be very useful.
In order to communicate with Dr. Alvarez Tormo we MMEX have ostablished
@ new code: i
‘The base of the code is in the small book: "MI PRIMER DICCIONARIO. ESCOLAR"

written by Jose Ardanuy Olague, from the publisher Vasco-Americana,
fim Bilbao, Spain, The key is the following:

the first number is the page of the book.

After this first number is placed a broken signa,

{he second number is the number of the line where the word that you want
to say is.

Only words in the dictionary that are Capitalized are used, that is

to say the first word in each line, the MEUKH word whose definition

is put after the small letter.

Miami for a short stay. This man, who spoke with Antonio Sanz, told
him that he had brought mo a meseage from someone who was in Spain.

: The 303 Committee approved the akiwve proposal.

* WH/C 66-479

26 OCT «6

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: Termination of Subsidy to
Manuel ARTINE Bu-.sa

1. A request for your approval is. contained in
paragraph 8.

2. As you are aware the Agency financially supported
the AMWORLD "unattributable operations" through ARTIME from
1963 through April 1965 at a cost of approximately
en million dollars, As of 1 May 1965 CIA with the
concurrence of the 303 Committee terminated this support.

8. On & June 1965, CIA sent a proposal to the 303
Committee for restoration of support to. Manuel ARTIME's
autonomous paramilitary group on a smaller scale for a
totally. distinct psychological warfare purpoce, This
proposal recommended expenditure of approximately $15, 000
monthly distributed as follows:

Support of MRH officies in U.S., Spain,
Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, Costa

Rica, Venezuela $ 3,200

Publication of TRIDENTE “5 $3,000
“* adie Broadcasts. to Cuba “22,800
si - ABTIME's travel in Central and cee

South America oo 8,000

Support of dependents of killed, cet

wounded and captured MRE members §,000

TOTAL $15,000



4. In September 1965,°DC/wH/Cuba agreed to the ‘
decision to cut ARTIME's subsidy to $5,000 monthly A
(ostensibly for support of dependents and survivors

of MRR dead, wounded and imprisoned), ag of 1. October’
1965, Of the $5,000 monthly aid, $2,000 according to
ARTIME was delivered to ‘Father Llorento who in turn
transfei-ced the funds through the official Spanish
pouch to Madrid to a member of the Embassy of Spain in
Bavana (QUANTUM-51). This official was later declared
PRG in Cuba and returned to Spain. :

i. 5. On 4 May 1966, ARTINE was told by hin Head-
rters case officer that effective 1 June 1966 the
ttipends” to persons inside Cuba, who were allegedly

receiving it through the Spanish Embassy, would be
terminated. Therefore, effective 1 June 1966, ARTIME'
payments from CIA would be cut’ to $3,000, At this ti:
ARTIME was also advised that strict budgetary limitations
were now being imposed on all government spending because

of Viet Nan and other commitments and that.it was quite
likely that further cuts or the elimination of the

remaining $3,000 ronthly subsidy would occur in tte not

too distant future. At that time ARTIME was also encouraged
to seek gainful employment. and to encourage anyone who was
receiving money from him to do likewise. He was also told
‘that the Agency would be willing to assist him in obtaining

training to obtain it.

6. Since this date ARTIME has continued to receive
‘the $3,000 monthly subsidy the majority of which he must
spend for his own personal expenses as he continues to
. travel rather frequently in Central America and maintains
his home in Miami without any other income.

7.  ARTIME's contribution to the Agency's operational
effort against Cuba in the past year has been negligible.
W/Cuba feels that continued payment of the $3,000 subsidy
fig net warranted and can no ionger be justizied., in view
yes of the present budgeta:y limitation on Cuban operations it
@an well be utilized for more significant and hopefully .
more productive activities.

8. It is not believed that termination of the
remaining subsidy sould require 303 Committee concurrence
but you may wish to discuss this verbally with the DDP
who is familiar with the AMWORLD operation. If approval

is granted to terninate the subsidy without 303 Committee
approval, we would plan to advise the Coordinator of

Cuban Affairs for Department of State, lr. Robert
Stevenson, and Mr. William Bowdler, Staff Member, National
Security Council (White House assistant), before notifying
ARTIME, This is considered necessary since ARTIME is
likely to try to use Mr. Bowdler or the CCA to press

CIA not to terminate the subsidy. Your approval is
requested to terminate the $3,000 monthly subsidy to
ARTIME effective 31 Deceaber i966.

Dear Jin: ;
Just a few lines te inform you of ny trip through Latin
America:

| 1, The meeting with SOOZA vas at “Las "inas", where a public
celebration of the Liberal Party was being held, It was on : i
4 October 1966, We talked shout the possibility that he would
go down in History hy foruing revolutionary government, i t
honest, with an indisputatle sociat-planning, I told him

that he did not need money nor power, only international pres~

tige, that he would only acquire that international prestige

7 b: giving a moral slap in the face to those in the interna-

+ *. ¢lonal field who were trying to insinuate that he was just ~
one more dictator, lie cormented favorably on everything that

I told him. We talked about the meeting of Presidents and

of the possibility that the subject of CUBA would be discussed

in private, in secret conference,

In Nicaragua I.also received Amado ALVAREZ Tormo, whose re-
port I sent with Carl, Since returning to ‘fiami I have re-
ceived a’ message from ALVAREZ Torno, in code, using a booklet
that he-gave me as key to the code, but honestly, I have

not been able to unscranmble or decode what he says. At any
rate, I already wrote to him telling him to explain the code
to me clearly, I am sending you the tiessage received, with
the booklet that serves as a key, to see if you understand it.

I also made contact with the "Chess Player" who is going to
Cuba and whom you can use.

I arrived in Costa Rica on 7 October 1966 in the early morn-
ing, by eutomobile, I stayed at the home of Juan Madriz,
present Secretary for Organization of the Nationa ration
Party. In that house I obtained the papers that I am sending
you, on the tuble of organization of the Party.

On 9 October, Pepe FIGHERNS came to Juan's house to visit me
at 12 noon (Costa Rica tims). be bad lunch together. fle
analyzed for mo the situation i7 Cesta Rica in the following
manner: The Government is not abie to govern and will fall
into anarchy. Frank MAPSUALL as conspiring te overthrow the
Government, Thoy (National Liberation) should wait for the

have private arsenals, and ry arsenal is the sparcest." We
aughed (surely he was talking about Pepe). lle told me that

On 13 October in the afternoon I was able to see “arcos ROBLES.

He told me that he had spoken with Luis CONTE Aguero and that
CONTE had asked him what would be the position of Panama if
they were to take continentewide steps in regard to Cuba,
and “Marcos had answered that Panaua's position was the most
aggressive against CAST?O,

I gave “arcos the report I had on Arnulfo ARIAS and the rrms

idents of America discuss, in private and secretly, the Cuban
question, ‘larcos ROBLES apneere to be in an openly aggressive
position and told me that he would speak with the Presidents
ef El Salvador and Guatemala to see if they were presenting

@ thesis in common on Cuba. He told me that the situation

in Guatemala, if CASTRO survived, would be terrible, since

she wavered between n military coup and a Communist coup.

Marcos told me that the only possible stabilization of Latin

- America included the assassination of CASTRO,

He thanked me for the reports received and asked me to let
him know anything I might find out.

On 18 Metober I net 3% 2 in the afternoon with Rafael CALDERA,

We connented on the position of Chile and of FREY on Fidel
CASTRO and he prowised me that in Mecenher, when he goes to
Chile to talk with FREI, he would try to convince hin to
take a more aggressive position against TPO, so that he
will be on a level with the Christian Der cratic rarties of
the Caribbean, like his: COPEY, We is very optinistic about
the next elections, I told him what I knew about the posi-

1 tion of Chile, that she had ‘been very soft ‘against CASTRO

| in spite of CASTRO's attacks.

He told me that he was convinced that FREI had spoken with
the Cuban regime about a possible including of Cuba in the
OAS again, but that afterwards FREI had repented; and it
was for that reason that Fidel attacked him so much.

He told me that Enrique HUEPTAS had been to visit him in the

name of "all the exile movement", to invite hin to a cele-

ration in Miami, That the only thing that he was surprised

at was the “extraordinarily anti-Anerican” positien of that

boy. I told him that Enrique HURRTAS was a great guy, but

was very embittered and of course he represented cnly the

doctors in Miami. .

> That same day, at 4 in the afternoon, I'met with GRCOSKC,
Under-Secretary General of the Presidency, in Miraflores,

He spoke to me very bitterly of the ', S. and of what they
had done in Santo fiomingo, He told me that he had been in
the Dominican Republic ‘al! curing the time of the “inter-
_ vention", 7

fle told me that Venezuela would adopt a strong position against
CASTRO in the conference of Presidents, That now CASTRO only
ponefited the "gorillas" of Argentina and Brazil and for that

1 departed congratulating Presicent LEONE on his position
with respect to the Jananese Cevernment in its trade with
Cuba, and I asked hin to make our desire of heing strongly
against CASTRO becone a reality,

he closed the neetins by saying, “Don't worry, we are now
very tired of Fidel, the other day we had to sink a boat
loaded: with munitions ‘and Castroites."

Ye told me that ‘that same day he would see the President;

That sane night I was having drinks with Danile SANSON, new
Nicaraguan Ambassador to Venezuela. Throuch hin I found out
some very curious things: there are three ambassadors in
Caracas who receive $5,000.00 a month to notify the Vene~
zuelan PICEPOL of all communicaticns in code, “One of them

is the one from Chile, who passes all the secret corréspondence
betweon CALDERA and FREI into the hands of the Venezuelan
DIGEPOL,

On the following day I had a meeting vith the "José Martf"
Civic Club, 7

Upon my arrival in Miami, on 20 Octoher, I had a telephone
call from SOPO, in which he told me that his friend Msiel
GONZALEZ, of the Second Front of the Escambray, had a friend
infiltrated into the ranks of Rolando MANSFERRER and that

he had heard the rumor that they were going to roh me of the
arms that I had near West Palm Beach. That they were trying
to find out the exact location, That night Eugenio CLAUDE
arrived from there (it is he who watches over the silent mo-
tors and the rubber rafts that we have on the farm, hecause
we don't nave any arms), since he had a trial the 2ist.

Yosterday, the 22nd, I went there (near Indiantown), to the
farm, to study security measures with respect to the motors
and the rafts and I found that on the only day CLAUDE had

H On 2 Cctober 1966, James 5, ZAHOTH (P) met with AMBIDDY<-2
i and the Mexico City representative of the MRR, Ur. Amaro Ce

i ALVAREZ Tormo, whose mailing aduress is Apartado Postal $3-922,
Mexico 17, D.F. te works at Ldboratorios Promeco de Hexico,

{ $.A., Bahia de San iipolito $1, velco, 0.F., Telephone 45-62-48, HEE 7
} and mailing address Apartado 53-978, “Mexico 17, 0.F.

Doctor ALVAREZ told the following story: ile is a Cuban
exile who came out in August 1960 and has worked since as the
HRR representative in Hexico. ile worked with the FRD in 1960-64
and hac had contact from time to time with wexico City Station
officers since that time. tis last contact, #0 far as he knows,
was Andrew r. MERTON (P). His brother is Doctor Jose Kamon
ALVAREZ Tormo, who was capt in Cuba in March 1965 and is
serving nine years in Cabafi. sison as a counter-revolutionery.
ALVAREZ believes his brother was. working @ “OFACT agent, but
is not sure. Two other voctors, who are membera of his family,
were captured at about the sane time. They are Doctor Fidencion
SANCHEZ Eacots, serving thirty years in Cabafias, and Doctor
Adalberto SAAVEDRA Diaz, serving twenty years in. Principe Prison.

Early in September 1966, ALVARLZ received s telephone call
from a Doctor (fnu) CAPOTE, a Cuban who is at the Public Health
Sehool of Mexico on a scholarship from the dorld Health Organiza=

- thon. His telephone number in Mexico City is 35-39-64, CAPOTE
identified himsalf as having deen a medical student in Havana
when Dector ALVAREZ was a resident.surgeon at tha University
Mespital, and asked if ALVAKEZ remembered him, ALVAREZ told him
that he remembered him (altiiough he did not). thinking that CAPOTE

obably wanted to contact him to make arrangements to defect.
ito WAREZ accepted an invitation to have dinner with CAPOTE and
met him the same evening. They went to a French restaurant with
good food, good wine, and good atmosphere, and CAPOTC paid the
eheek, ALVAREZ sail that when they mat, he vaguely remembered
~———~"She" ace of CAPUTE as one of his. former students but could rememe
ber nothing more about him. iz

After ‘nitial asall talk at dinner, ALVARDZ asked LZ there
were anything he could de to help CAPOTE to fact, as Voctor
Alarice FERNANDEZ had recently done (another Cuban doctor on 4&
WHO echolarahip in Mexico). CAPOTE replied that he wus not ine
tercsted in defecting, he was very happy in Cuba, Socialism is
wonderful, eto.- He went on to say that he wanted to talk with
ALVARES (n an attempt to help him out with a personal matter.

“ CAPOTE said he knew the brother of ALVAREZ and had sone friends
a» who ndgnt help to get him out of prison and out of Cuba. One of
"them, in particular, was coming to Mexico shortly, and when he

gre vag CAPOTE gaid he would call ALVAREZ and try to arrange
for Mis to talk with the person. ALVAREZ agreed, thinking
owas referring to the Vice-Minister of ‘iealth in Cuba,
whoa "= knew wae scheduled to transit Mexico soon thereafter piireeces
*nrO4ie to a United Nations meeting in sew York. a

ie naxt contact was on Thursday, 29 September 1966, at

He a ho pretense of boing another doctor or of using any
Gover. Stery, but identified himseif as a Cuban intelligence
gee has who might be able to help ALVAREZ to get his brother re-

rr along with his other two relatives. VALVERDE said that
f ALWKnEZ wanted to do go, tney could go back to Cuba together
SEkt day, hie brother and the other two would be released
Abita day and would be put on themxt flight back to Hexicos
ALVARYS ‘told him to slow down, that he had no intention of zoing :
bask Cuba with anyboay, mucn less a perfect atrangct wom ne
know and who might be playing any kind of a pame.
VALYE said he waa a wise man to check and be cure of? what he
war G2ing, and handed him a letter from a female cousli, whe te

rehaktiitate himself with his own country. She ended with a note
bert it the bearer of the latter was a person of absolute
cont \idiioe with authority to deal with ALVARCZ and make commitrents
on THE matter.



ALVAREZ read the letter ana put it tn his pocket, telling
VALVERDE that this still did not identify him nor dia it tell
him any more about what they wanted from hia, VALVERDE said
they wented only to help ALVAREZ and his relatives and were
trying to make it possible for his te de something tha: could
earn their release. VALVCRDZ then showed him a latter of introe
duction written on Cuban Ministry of the Interior official
stationery and signed by Ramiro VALDLZ,. which stated that “Sefor
VALVERDE® was an official of the Ministry who was teavelling
abroad on a spacial mission and should sesisted by ali Cuban
official missions and friendly gove Mts. (ALVAREZ sted that
he left the meeting first, then waited around outside until he

ww CAPOTE and VALVERDE leave in a car with diplomatic tags,
although he did not get the license nuabers.)

After ALVAREZ read the letter and gave it back, VALVERDE
told him, "Look here now, be sure we can take care of your
brother, but we don't want money, In other «. bd) okay, we'll
take money because we can always use it, but t's not what we-
want. from you." ALVAREZ told him to wait a minute, If he was
threatening his brother unless ALVAREZ gave him information, he
say no. “I will have the pain of whatever happens to ay
brother, but you have the responsibility for it because:he is
ur prisoner. Nothing I can do will control what happens to
Mo Only you can control that." He said he would not collaborate
vith them. VALVERDE replied: that. this was similar to the response
thoy usually pot from the so-called demooratic typas, but that
ALVAREZ was going too fast and. refusing before he knew the situa-
tion. He described ALVAREZ as playing Don Quixote and tilting
at windmills. He said the Cuban situation would ultimately be
@olved onthe international level and the quastion of which side
will come out on top would be resolved at that point by the big
re and nothing they (VALVERDE and ALVAREZ) did at their .
tevel was going to have any.»sal effect on tha outcoas. Therefore,
there was no reason they could not work together on comething that
was in their commen interests and to their mutual advantage,

VALVERDE then said he would be completely frank with ALVAREZ
and told him they knew they had only one rezl enamy dn the world,
dneluding PBPRIME, and that was WOFACT. ie aaid they also knew

said he conia wait until Saturday, 1 October 1966 for another

attention While he thought over and made up his mind on their offer.
For example, they had a need for more end better quality information

feoted a comment then that this wae jumping the gun and might get
them off Qj something far away from Cuba, AMBIDDY=1 and the
welatives Qf ALVAREZ, which were the main considerations. He
euggeeted again hat they sleep on it and they could talk agains
He said §% ALVAREZ agreed to cooperate with them, he would put

ALVAREZ Gaia he had no objection to. meeting and talking again, but
he was SWiG he would not be changing nia mind. VALVERDE said again

Before leaving, on Friday night, he called CAPOTE and told hia,

Warned them he had not changed his mind at that ‘point. CAPOTE
eid Honday was fine and he would contact ALVAREZ to make an

After discussing the matter with AMBIDDY-1, they decided that
ALVAREZ would fo back to Mexico on Sunday, 2 Oatober 1966, and
make the meeting on Monday when they contact him, ie would cone

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with Manuel Artine, 1G September 1966

1. The writer had a one-hour conversation with Manuel
Artime on 10 September 1966 during which Artime recounted
what he purported to be the highlights of a conversation
he had with Mr. William Bowdler at Bowdler’s White House
office on the afternoon of 9 September.

2. Artime said he was told by Mr. Bowdler that he
ghould realize that his appointment with him, inasmuch as
it being held in his White House office, had been
clea with and had the approval of the President. He said
Leaded gaid he wanted to make two points complately clear
0 him.

ci a, ‘There was no present plan or projected
planning by the U.S. for military action against

b. There was a possibility that the U.S.
Government might re-oxamine the Cuban situation
4n the next few months and that he was interested
in getting Artime's views on the present situation
as well as comments and/or suggestions covering
the future.

8.  Artime said he told Bowdler that the morale of the
Cuban exiles and of the people in Cuba was at its lowest ebb.
He said not alonc castro's opponents but Castro himself
through his own sources knew that the oniy significant
activity belag conducted’ against his regime at the present
time was prepagenda radio broadcasts beamed into the istand
and these were having no effect on the stability of vane
Castro regime. The people in Cuba and opposed to Castro
are now living in a complete state ct apashy, because they
gee no hope that anything will be done tc frce them from
Communism. .



SECRET

-2-

4. Artime said he volunteered his services as a
military man in any capacity in which he could possibly
serve. He said he spoke in terms of hit-and-run and
sabotage raids at several simultaneous points on the
island the purpose of which would be to:

a. Raise the morale and internal
resistance spirit of the people on the
island. o

bd. Lead to further economic difficulties
by forcing the government to recall to active
military service, to man coastal defenses, etc.
military and militia types now working on sugar,
other agricuitural and industrial production.

Cc. Force Castro to maintain his military
estabJishments in a constant state of alert
thereby creating further financial problems as
well as possible morale problems within the
military establishment.

He emphasized that these "raids" could be done without
dmecreasing the budget or taxes. They could be carried
eut by Cubans using equipment and material presently
available to the U.S. Government.

’

&. He said Bowdler asked him for his suggestions as

to what could be done in the way of military action agvinst .
Cuba and he replied that the U.S. Government with its auge-

military establishment and experience was much better

qualified than he tc make suggestions.

6. Other topics covered were Castro's verbal attacks
against President Frei of Chile and the Alliance for Progress.

a Artime said he told Bowdler he was of course very
as

concerned about future plianning--if any--concerning Cuba
he had a wife and family to support and should really

seriously reorganize and reorient his personal life if

there were no prospects o7 some action in the futuro anc
his participation therein. He said Bowdler asked him if
bad wny financial problems and he assured him he did not
at present but couid have in the future.

told him to contact him if he did encounter any financial
Problems. He also said that Bowdler assured him that he
would have some idea within the next one-tso months whether
thore was going to be a re-examination of the U.S. Position
and policy towards Cuba and that he would let Artime know

&@% soon as he had any information, Bowdler took Artine's
phone number and address in Miami and gave Artime his office
telephone number, Artiae said fe plans to phone Sowdler in
about a month to cay hello and ask him if there is any news.

In departing he expressed deep appreciation for my having given him 60
much time (1 hour ) and for having the chance to converse with one who
understood Cuba's problems and his preoccupations. This was a rather
subdued and reflective Artime -- quite a contrast with the fiery and com-

July 23, 1966
Dear Jin:

I pass the following information to you: 1. Colonel
SANCHEZ, General “anager of Lanica Airlines, has received a
notice from the Compaifa Cubana de Aviaci6n, of which I am
enclosing photos.atic copies, and according to Colonel SANCHEZ
this is extremely serious, since this not only bd bape a
bill of $2,496.00 dollars which will go into the hands of
CASTRO, but all the Latin American aviation companies will

pe to pay & similar bill monthly, which dollars will go to
uba.

Colonel SANCHEZ says that. the seriousness of the problem
does not stop there, It is the opinion of the Latin American
airlines that Cubana de Aviaci6n will send each one of these
lines a bill for everything they have not paid since CASTRO
took power. It is to be noted that no company has paid this

. and that some, like Lanica Airlines, have changed their routes

30 aS not to pass over Cuba.’ Colonel SANCHEZ says that if
Fidel collects this belated bill, it will mean about a million
dollars for nim,

2, According to conversations held with General MONTIEL,
the last three cases of Nicaraguan persons who were trained
in Russia and have re-entered Nicaragua have done so using the
_ Toute: Socialist Bloc - Cuba - Mexico: + Miami - country of
‘origin, The united States visas were obtained in Mexirs and-
they were transit visas. This can throw the Latin American
authorities off, since nc one expects that from Miami could
= come anyone coming from Russia.
The last one captured in Nicaragua (Carl can tell you), on
being interrogated as to why he had gone up to the U. 8. from
Mexico and then to El Salvador and Managua, answered that he
had received orders to do so.
>It must be taken into account that on passing through the
United States with a transit visa these men can give out orders
and watchwords.

3. The two Nicaraguans with whom I have spoken about
possibly working for our cause, putting the preblem to then
as something caipietely Cuban, were: RaGl PALACIO, law student
at the Centra: American University. of Managua, intelligent,
good speaker, ccurageous, has participated in demonstrations
against the Government of the SOMOZAs, and is a nephew of
Deputy MOLINA, who supports him financially and pays for his
schooling. MOLINA is well known as an anti-American, although
dn. the background ho gets along with the United States Ambas~
sader to Nicaragua, Ratt PALACIO told me that he had to think

|



it over carefully, since this could mean the loss of one year
in his career,

Against this position (of his career), I spoke to him about
tre possibility of becoming a great leader of the Nicaraguan
Youth and about possible training abroad in the political,
economic, or social field, whichever he would like most.

Th: other Nicaraguan from whom I received a message was Gustavo
JARQUIN, He is a half-brother of Leticia JARQUIN, who works
with me (they have the same father but not the same mother).
He sent me the message through a brother of Leticia whose name
is Adfn, who also lives in Andaime, Nicaragua. The nessage
was the following: that he wanted to talk to me about some
very interesting things which would benefit me and Cuba,

This man was in Cuba for training, and, it seems, in Russia.
A militant Communist, it seems that he has had financial dif-
ficulties, which the Party has not helped him out of.

Carl is investigating him before I speak with him.

4, I am attaching a machine copy of the letter which
Enrique TOUS sent to Manuel GUILLOT, in which he tells about
the matter of Blas ROCA y Marinello. -

S. 1 am attaching a photostatic copy.of a letter received
by Jos& GONZALEZ Puig, which gives a good explanation of the
situation in Cuba. -

6. A package was sent from Managua to Cuba, via Mexico,
in which were: one pair of tennis shoes, two undershirts,
two undershorts, four pare of stockings, two ladies’ brassieres,
two ladies' panties, three bottles of medicine,
We'll see if they receive it in Cuba and when.
On Thursday, July 21, Mr. Elo VALOIVIA Sori, who worked for
@ long time in the M.R.R. in Cuba, arrived on one of the flights
to freedom.
fee gold me: that the only name spoken in Cuba was that of

: ‘

2, That the Cuban Government confiscates all incoming. cors.-
spondence from the United States of America which has newly-

= issued stamps, to use them in philatelic negotiations. When

the stamp is no longer printed they ict che letters through.

$3. Lucio MONTALVO and Marfa Teresa MONTALVO, who asked to. leave
Cuba and sre about to arrive in the United States, are agents
of CASTRO's G-2, They live in Marianao, Calle 124 and Avenida
49, across from Police Station No. 17

’ 4, In an interview that Elo VALDIVIA Sort had during a visit ~

thet they allowed him with JesGs GONZALEZ Burgués, who is a
tisoner at the "Jaruco No. 1" rehabilitation farm, he informed
im that when he was a prisoner at La Cabafia (about three

0) he learned that Hubert MATOS was at La Cabafa, that
they gave him special preferential treatment, and that Fidel
visited him.once a week.



Juan ALSINA Navarro was also a prisoner at La Cabafia, while
CUBELAS was only ‘detained at his residence, and about GALLARRETA
nobody knew anything.

5S. Elo VALDIVIA Sorf had contacts with Alfredo ALBUERNE, an
electro-mechanical engineer and technician who works at the
Cuenca Sur (South Basin) in Havana, in the supplying of water
to the Capital, This man spoke critically of a relative who.
had gone to the United States and who in his opinion was an
agent of Fidel CASTRO, This relative who left had been a ser-
geant in the Marina de Guerra (Navy) in Cuba in BATISTA's
time, Everything seems to coincide with the description of
the ALBUERNE who was a prisoner in the Zenén Viera Base in
Niceragua,

The engineer Alfredo ALBUERNE is against the Communist regime,
and although he wants to leave Cuba he is watched carefully
because for the moment the Government docs not have a replaces
ot Fad him in the work that he does in the Cuenca Sur (South
Basin),

He (Elo VALDIVIA Sori) had contact with Luis VALDIVIA Delgado,
@ youth who was won over by the Cumpulsory Military Service
and who now works as-an electronics technician in. the Microwave
Station on the Staff of the Armed Forces.

We (Elo VALDIVIA Sorf) had contact with Lazaro FERNANDEZ (he

- ds not very sure of the last name), a youth who works for the

honk Security Service in one of the main offices in “old

vana". a :

He (Elo VALDIVIA Sorf). brought in the information that Vicente
LOPEZ, “ho lives at Avenida-35 No. 11613, in Apartment 11, in
Marianao, although he pretends to be an inspector. in the I.C.A.I.
a is dissatisfied with the Communist Government, is in reality
a.Ge2 agent. 7

Also that Fidel CASTRO is in the habit of going évery day to

the Laguito (translator's note: “laguito" means “little lake",
but in this context it could be a bar, restaurant, or club of
some kind) at the Country Club to visit LLANUSA.

Also that after 3:00 in the afternsia, Fidel CASTRO usually.
takes the following route: Calzada (avenue or drive). de Columbia
as far as Avenida 35, and then he continues on Avenida 35 as

far as La Plays (the Beach} ~~ F

Also that he (Fidel CASTRO) does not usually have a set schedule;
he goes at 3:00, or at 4:00, or at 5:00, or at 6:00 in the
afternoon, :
I told Elo VALDIVIA Sorf to get in touch immediately with his -
friends in the interior and tell them to write simple letters

to the New York address if they are in agreement to do something

- useful,

a 7, The following need Re-entry Permits to be able to leave
the United States; Edgar SOPO Granda
Marcos VALDES Castilla,

ee: ee

‘
’



The first of these is going to work (it is very possible) as
a publicity agent in SOMOZA's campaign.
The second succeeded in getting a position as a real estate
salesman in an Anerican company and he has to go to Central
America and Venezuela. :
If these boys find jobs there they will not only have their
future assured, but they will continue to be able to collaborate
with the United States. If you refuse the request, you are
utting me in a predicament, because they cannot get jobs in
Miami and I cannot support them. think that, considering
the circumstances, it is inhuman that boys who have collaborated
in everything with the United States, including at the risk
of their own lives, should receive treatment so absurd that it

jeopardizes their financial stability.

8. The radio in Cuba has set me up as an example in the
Cuban exile movement, and I have received word that they have
Janned, inside Cuba, to eliminate me. i +
e to this, I went to the office of the sheriff of Dade County
to see about the possibility of obtaining a permit to carry @
gun, which was granted through the intervention of a veteran
of the Bay of Pigs invasion, ‘r. Eric JIMENEZ, who is now a
detective in the County, and of his chief, Captain LONGBOTTOM,
(I mentioned this to Carl on my last visit to Nicaragua.)
Captain LONGBOTTOM told me that he wanted very much to go to

Central America, since he had never been there before. I told
him that I would be very happy to get him a Nicaraguan visa
and that I would be able to put him up, if it were just for 8
short time, at the home of any Nicaraguan friend of mine.

My motives for saying this were:

1, Gratitude for the efforts they have made.

2. So that the Niami police would realize the con-
sideration and respect that they have for me in these Latin
Amerigan countries.

' 3. I even thought about the possibility that some
ies had doubts about whether or not I really had,
at Fidel CASTRO says I have, and

American agenc
LONGBOTTOM could be a gonb
not for the Company, since the Sompany already knows perfectly

well what I have and what I don't have.
When I wes in Nicaragua I noticed that both Captain LONGBOTTOM
and Eric were carefully inspected on arriving in Miami (in

in Nicaragua I left in a safe in Managua because I was thinking
of the Labpbbatentd that it might occur to some feverish mind

to check se out upon my arriva) in Miami and find that list,
which, except to you, would be very difficult for me to explain.
In effect, when I arrived in “Miami, and after passing through
the formalities of Immigration and Customs, two courteous in-
vestigators, one from the Department of Customs and the other
from the Burcu of Narcotics, invited me very delicately to

go into their office to talk with them, There they searched
me, and with the greatest courtesy in the world they asked me
the stupidest questions that could be asked of anyone, one of
which was: 4f Captain LONGBOTTCM and Fric JIMENEZ belonged to
the C.I.A, I don't know whether or not they thought the C.I.A.
and J were waging a private war against CASTRO, or if they -
thought the C.I.A. and I were involved in narcotics smuggling.
The search they made of me was rather ineffective, since I my-
self opened the secret compartment of my briefcase for them

go that they could see that if I had wanted to smuggle something
I would have done so, but nevertheless I had not done so,
Anyhow, I am going to present my complaints to the Department

_ Of State in Miami, and I shall write a letter to the President

of the United States of America, because I helieve that the
least one can do for a friend is. to treat him with cons.deration,
or at least not subject him to any annoyance. If they had. some
doubt about me, I think that there would have been ways much
more courteous and above all less disagreeable to resolve them,
I want to make it clear that the conduct of these agents was

at all times courteous, And it all ended in pleseene chatter
in which I even offered to collaborate with them in everything
which might pertein to their offices, except in that which
wight harm the cause of the liberation of taba. I made it very
clear that I was not working as an agent of any agency or de-
partment of the United States, and that anytime I learn some-
thing that might harm the United States or something that has
to do with international Communism, I would notify old friends

I have within certain departments of the United States Govern-
ment.

9. I have opportunities to work for an import-export com-
pany, and us a saissman in Centrai America for a metallurgical
company. I heave decided that the best work for me is in making
use of my public relations and of my cluse ties with the Cen-
tral American sovernments,

Besides, this would permit me to continue travelling through-
out Centrel Averica, to maintain my contacts, and to be useful
to 6 Country and te Democracy.

If there were some possibility of being a salesman or manager
of a company which is developing economic activities in Central
America and Leased in Nicaragua, I would appreciate very
much this type of work, That is if Customs, Immigration, Bor-
der Patrol, etc,, etc., stc,, don't begin to get in my way, !

think that the only thing to worry about in my case is that
one day I may be assassinated by international Communism, I
believe that I have been known for seven years now, and I have

mot failed, not before the agents of the Cuban Communist G-2, -
nor before the very real possibility of the Firing squad.

10, I have received a message from General Fulgencio
BATISTA y Zaldivar through Orlando PIEDRA, that he. has. requested
an interview with me, I think that the best way to learn his
plans is to speak with Orlando PIEDRA, and I have accepted,
in principle, the interview, in a place, on a day, and at a
time that I specify, !£ it is possible I will get a recorder,
and if not, I will inform on the results of the effort.

With nothing more at the moment, your humble servant very at-
tentively takes leave of you,

C Cuban Service Charges Against LAWICA Airline
RD CRT

For Headquarters information, or action if
deemed appropriate.

4, On 20 July 1956, AMBIDDY-1 gave James D, ZABOTH a
copy of a letter to LANICA (Nicaraguan national airline)
from Empresa Consolidada Cubana ce Aviacion, containing a
bill for USS1,496.00 as radio service charges. ZA30TH made
a copy of the letter and bill, which are attached herewith.
AMBIDDY-1 said he was given his copy of the letter by Col.
Herberto SANCHEZ, President of LANICA.

2, According to AMBIDDY-1, Col. SANCHEZ said that
every Latin American airline which overflies Cuba, or us:
Rancho Boyeros radio as a check point, is going to be billed
retroactively for these services. LANICA's bill is relatively” ~~
low because their flights dog-leg around Cuba, but some of

the other airlines are going to have rather high bills. Col.
SANCHEZ estimated that the charges against Latin American aire
lines would total almost one million U.S. dollars.

3. Col. SANCHEZ considered this information. significant
and asked AMBIDDY-1 if he could get it into the right: hands.
“ZABOTH has requested that AMBIDDY-1 deliver his copy of the |
attached letter and bill to his Headquarters case officer,
and thio report is forwarded only as a follow-up.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECO!
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY-1
——_

1. Puring the course of an operational meeting with
AMBIDDY-1 in Wishington, D.C., on 22 June, he raised the
subject of financial payments presently being made to him
monthly ($3,000) which he claims is used to help dependents
of AMWORLD members whese husbands or providers have been
either kiiied or imprisoned as a result of activities for
AMWORLD, AMBIDDY-1 was specifically interested as to

Mi-mi, 6 July 1966
Dear Jin: : iin 2 :

I wish to conmunicate the following:

1. The magazine “Tridente” will continue to be published

once @ month with as many sacrifices as may be necessary,

wees because it hurts me to see the way the Batistians have

gotten hold of public opinion, trying to knit an

secon eenieen prentaeisnirtes”

anti-american atmosphere and giving the impression in

their transmissions to Cuba that all those in exile think

the same way they do. I believe this greately haras any
internal conspiracy which may exist in Cuba.

2. In my next letter I will send you my complete form.

+ I received a long distance telephone call from Juan Nufiez,
as Costa Rica. He told me that Daniel Oduber wanted to- speak
» . with me as soon as possible becsuse he had important things.

v to propose to me ard that what he was going to propose
% would benefit me.

4. .Radio Havana. continued to attack me unmercifully. It says.
that I have 8,000 volunteers in Nicaragua. :

S./ From an infiltration which I have in the Miami. Police

(Dade County), it seems that ‘they knew where Magsferrer had

the lot of 200 weapons: and when they went te capture .

a high official (possibly Major Hili) told them that he

had received the order not to touch those weapons from the



6,

Mafsferrer has mentioned anong .his men that those
Weapons were given to him by the CIA. The name of the
source of the information was omitted (of the policeman)
for his protection, since he is sure that it may harm hin,
The source is reliable. 7

I was able to establish contact with my parents through
By cousin, but still know nothing of the contact requested
by me to be made within Cuba, My parents expect to make
an attempt in obtaining asylum at the Mexican Embassy

in Cuba.

Tam sending you a resumé of Rene Cancio, who wishes to
join the Navy of the United. States to go to Viet-Nam

to fight, since he is unable to do anything in Cuba for
the time being. He is our Chief of Naval Operations and
I consider him a great man. He worked with your company
for a long time. :

On 28 June I had an interview with Enrique Huertas, who

Sried to babe me to join a group of personalities

to “Sublic scandal ger President Johnson at tho

White Nouse. He thinks that the homage which he himself
has prepared for —

~9 July at the Cuban Medical Association,
where a group of personalities hava ween invited couid

be the beginning of a scandal of international magnitude
(something like a hunger strike in front of the White House
in Washington). Jchnson will find himself obliged to do
something of the Cuban problem because the opposition would
e this in their platform,

\

aie



He says that Edward Kennedy told hin that the Cuban problem
had been definitely shelved by President Johnson. 1 told

him that in sy opinion the Cuban problem was in a “freezer”
but not definitely closed, and that there were other ways
to solve this problem; that in ay opinion a Texan may yield
with good manners (President Johnson) but not by force.
That my opinion was that if we resort. to violence, the
reaction would be anti-productive. That TI was of the
impression that they were conspiring against the North
American Government in the interior of Cuba, and that this.
I had learned from sources in Cuba. That a violent
manifestation against the America Government could destroy
all active subversive plans because the Cuban soldiers who
were conspiring would lose their faith in the American
Government. Huértas is very hurt due to the culmination
:.. O£ the Batistians. In my opinion it is because they have
cut a budget which he had. But if all those who have their
budgets cut were to react that way it would be because
they were badly chosen for the position they hold,
“one works fcr principles or for money,

Z leave fe. Nicaragua and from there will report what
I find. When I return I will call, ae

Regerds,

Manolo

0 Batista Propaganda Activities in the Hiani Arca

‘acon me 9a

maroc
See paragraph 3 below

1. Im recent conversations with AMBIDDY/1 at Head-
quarters, he expressed concern over the extent of former
President Fulgencio Batista's publicity/propaganda activities
im the Miami area and the effect aad influence these activities
@re having on the large Cuban exile community, According to
AMBIDDY/1, the most effective propaganda inediuma in the Miami
grea are directed, controlled and financed by Batista
interests and are designed to rebuild Ratista's amage. He
mentioned specifically Patria which is financed by Batista,
published once weekly and hag a wide free distribution. Ta
addition, reference was made to radio station WMIA which
AMBIDDY/1 claimed was the principal station which broadcast
Batista propaganda programs. AMBIDDY/1 commented that the
Batista propaganda was having an effect on the exiles aad,

as he put it, if it continues at its present rate, che exitea
in Miami will consider Batista a "saint" in comparison to ~
Fidel Castro.

2. Headquarters fully recognizes JMWAVE's feelings
regarding AMBIDDY/1 and the fact that he is anything but an
unbiased observer.-- In- fairness, however, it should be pointed
out that he did not couple the above observations with a
piten for approval or financ to conduct propaganda activities
to counteract Batista's effort.

3. Yor the record, Headquarters is not particularly.
interested in seéing Batista's imge rebuilt amongst the exiles.
Although it is realized that the Station normally would not

ve interested in Batista's activities, it would be aypreciated
af the Station would forward whatever information is avail-
able concerning pro-Bdtista propaganda in the Miami area.and,-.

4% possible, an assessuent as to the extent of its influence.
on the exile community.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD i

SUBJECT: Operational Meetingswith AMBIDDY/1, Washington,
D.C., 22-23 June 1966 —7"__

1, ANBIDDY/1 was requested to travel from Miami to
hington, B.C., in a phone call to his residence in
4 on 20 June, He arrived in D.C. on the afternoon of
22 June. We met in his hotel room at the Manger Hay-Adams
Hotel the evening of 22 June and later had dinner together.
A round-up meeting was held at noon time ca 23 June after
which AMBIDDY/1 left for New York City on what he termed
“personal business."

2. The principal reason for bringing AMBIDDY/1 to
Washington was to check out with him what equipment-- ~~
including arms and ammunition--remained from the AMWORLD
activity here in the States, what it consisted of, where it
was stored and whether or not any of the equipment had been
disposed of recently or whether there had been any recent
inquiries made to purchase any of the equipment (this inquiry
‘Was prompted by JMWAVE 1479). These points were taken. up
early in the meeting.

is the situation in exile public opinion, The pro-Batists People are
trying to imply that Batista hss never cut his friends down economically,

4. AMBIDDY~2 at the writer's request rechecked with é
Arrizurieta rege-ding his auurces of information in Costa
Rica and specifically his unidentified cenetration #f the
Communist Party noted in parayrapn 3 of reference B. AMBIDDY=2
then reported that Arrizurieta bad the following. four principal
sources of information in Costs Biea with whom ne had
maintained direct contact.

Walter Vasquez ~ infiltrated in the Pree Costa
Rican movement

dove Lais Cascante ~ Student ~ infiltrated into
feo Section of the Communist

Rigo Marin ~ farser — chauffeur ~ infiltrated into
farm section of the CP

dose Gauboa = “Chepe” — worker in Puerte Limon .
infiltrated into the CP in Puerte Limon
and Atlantic coast

‘There are no identifiable headquarters traces om any of these
‘ four persons.

5. Agcording to AMBIDDY-1, Jose Gamboa was the
Griginal source of the infcrmation contained in paragraph
8 A. of reference B. However the information cane to #
A@rrizariets from an unnamed Captain in the Guardia Fiscal who. ~
Works in Puerto Limon. In other words the assumption is that
dese Gambea passed the information to the Guardia Fiscal
Captain te carry to Arrizuricta in Sas Jose.

6, AMBIDOY-1 also reconfirmed that his access to
iaformatica on the PLN was through Arrizurieta (reference. D)
which with Arrizurieta’s departure from Costa Rica will
Be lenger be availabl AMBIDDY-1 professes to be & personal
friend of Reberto Madris, Secretary to the former president
ef Costa Rica and of Guillermo Vargas vho is connected with
the Instituto Nacional de Viviends Urbana (INVU), Costa Rican
Housing Agency. He said that the former will contimis
to afford him accezs to activities of the so-called (RLICi.
QOUBER group and the latter is his contact in the Fiqueres«

%. AMBIDDY.1 was told during these tvo meetin that
EUBARE had no interest in his maintaining any “intelligence
@overage” in Central or South America and could not make
eny funds available to him to support such activities... For
the information of addressees AMBIUDY/1 has been receiving
® monthly payment of 35,000 from KUBRRE since October 1965.
This money was allegedly being used support for dependents
end eembers of AMWORLD. This sum is being cut back. to. $3,000
monthly effective 1 June 1966 and will gradually be cut
back further in the futuee until elisinated. With this loss
@f funds AMBIDDY/1 will obviously have to reduce bis travele
