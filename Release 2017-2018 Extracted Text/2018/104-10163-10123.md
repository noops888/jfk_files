even more long

Artime and the MRR have represented since 1958 an effort at

democratic, Catholic-oriented reforn within Cuba--one which

originally allied Itsell with Castro as long as be appeared

ants-connunist, but broke with hin as soon as his connunist

connections became evident. Artime himself was an important

lender In the field of ag-icultural reform in the early days

of. the Castro regime, when he was de facto chief

of the

agricultural reform program in Oriente Province, Here he

Invented the systen of "rural commandos", 1.e., Ercups of

ntudents who worked in the rural arens with the less privileged

youth, teaching reading and writing, public. health and sanita-

tion, organization of cooperatives, improved agricultural

methods, and similar sujects. (Information on his efforts

does not, by the way, sten only fron Artine; & large number of

members of his novement were debriefed by CIA in 1960 vien

they left Cuba. Many of them were later trained as part of

Brigade 2506 and fought in the Bay of Pigs landing j Thus,

Artime has more of a clain to a reputation as & partierl end

1. According to information recfévod Iron Gulllerno Vargas,

In San Jose, Costa Rica, who has Islende who have infiltrated the

Communist group of Marcial Agullur, the following ia reported:

It has been approximately five months that Nicaragum and Costa

Ricans have been trained in the farm that Marcial Agullur owns

by Rio Claro (In ENTXXXXT the south of Costa Rica). This training

In given in suall groups of 5 - 10, 1a order to be able to hide and

so into the interior of the jungle that in there in case the

•. .

government of Conta Rica makes & surprise Inspection, They (Communista)

think that Somoza 1s expecting an Infiltration of merrillas frOM

Cubm through the Atlantic and they plan to surprice the ilcaragun

government by infiltrating this group through the Paelfic 1r

Nicaragu. Then as soon as the Government of Noaragua mobilizes.

and trope towards the Pacific; Fidel will mand another group

through the Atlantic. They hope to do this before the elections.

They hope that men who are already In Nicaragua win prepare their

arrival by creating chaos, sabotaging, and terrorten. They have

brought Incendiarloe end equipment for sabotage Into Nicaragus and 1t

appears that thay have & great cargo of arms in LSON (Nicaragua).

2. According to Information from Alejandro Montero, a Costa Rican

He gets money by taking the relatives of exiled Cubana out of Cuba.

BIver to me by our Cuban agents: Mario loya and Sergio Cabrera

who live in San Jone, Costa Rica.

t As I was almost 11ke a commission agent for the "Scopitone, Ime."

of Chicago, I had two XXXXI commercial Interviews with Frank

arshall, at the last intervlew he told me he wanted to speak alone

with me (at both meetings there had been present two representatives

from the scopitone co.). I made an appointment with him at the Hotel

"Conta Rica! IT where Scopiton: had a suite.

There I spoke alone with him on 12 vecember at 12:00 in the afternoon,

In hotel room #204.

Fo told me that

he wanted to buy arms fron me, that he knew I had.

I told him that the ones I had had in Nicargus I had turned in to

the government (that 1s false), and that there were only some left

In other places 1. Contral America. I told him I had to know 1m

what cause these arns were going to bo utilized, I also told him that

I had the moral obligation to kill be vigilant and see that the

Communists would not utilize them. I told him that I was not a

vendor of arms, but a revolutionary. (I talled to him about thin

trying to get information out of hin, becuse there arm of mine are

only for Cuba and againat Cantro.)

He

told me that he needed then for himself, that he espected a

revolutionary outburst fron one moment to the nest in Costa Rica

and that he didn't want his "private arsenal" to be smuller than

the ones that Calderon Guardiasj

Pope Pigueres, "Odubers and the

Corrunists had (according to him each of the aforementioned groups

had their own arsenals).

I asked him when he needed these arms and he answered:NOt.

I told him I would have to take three weeks to think about and thei

I would give him an answer: he answered after thinking for a wile:

Okay, I can give you one month to give me an answer but no nore.

My opinion is that he is in a plot to overthrow the government.

The situation In Costa Rica le very bad, for the unhappy president does

not have a definite political group to support him, and therafore

he is in the hands of the diverse groups to advocated him:. Calderon

.. ^

Guardia, Ulate, Schandl, Frank Marshall, etc, there are persons who

"ach have a group who respond to their own sectarinn interests and

not to Costa Rica, and who respond much less to the President.

stay in power"

5. On ? Decenber at 1:00 Fo. I had an Interylou with PIT Daniel

Oduber XXXx' (Inwyer) in his office. (about three blocks from the

Hotel Costa Rica).

He X! spole badly to me about Don Pepe Figueres and "Chico Orlich",

ho told that they wanted to eliminate his presidential aspirations

for the coming campaign and postulate Don Pepe again. He maid that

they (Don Pope und Orlich) were the Johnsons of Conte ice and he wie

the Kennedy.

I' lucky, he said, that they are stupid and that they are not avare

of the fact that an attack is being created and they are not...

prepared for

that energency. I am prepared, he told me. Then be

told me that ho had an airfield big enough for a C-46 on his farm,

close to the border with Nicaragus, MANNINTH! on the Pacifle

aldo, and that it the determined nonent ho could receive arms at

that place. He again asked for my collaboration in the case of

I revolt In Conta Rica and he concretely asked me that if at the

time of a revolt I would help with technicians and arms.

6. About Dr. Alvarez Tormo: He has stayed in contact with the

poople of the Cuban Embasy In Mexico. He le very worried because

there people ask for information and he does not know wat to uay

for the contaet fron the Company that spoke with him in Mexico, pole

with him just one time ind he has not returned to spenk with him

gain. He cannot find him because thoy aid not leave him the neconary

mignals. The people fron the Cuban Embassy In Mexico paid for bie

trip to the hounge which was at the Basque Center that they gave the

professors of the medical faculty of Havana (DI. Alvarez Torto was

•. professor). Dr. Alvarez Tormo was one of the spenkers. This took

place the 3rd and 4th of December In Miamt.

Dr. Alvarer Torno gave then detailed inforation on everything that

was said at the function (by suggestion of Don Manuel Guillot).

They have brought Dr. Alvarez Tormo iron Cuba, photographs and

letters fron his reintives. (They were brought by the people fron

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico).

Ir. Alvaren Tormo musneste that all the cuban exiles who have relative.

Living in prison in Cube mhould be shecked very cautiously because

the people in the Cuban Imbanay in Hordoo have a magnificent network

of these types of agents who, because of blackmall, are giviog

inforantion.. I ask you that you treat Di. Alvarez Torno justly

because he is playing with hin brothers 11fe. I think that an

work can be very useful.

In order to connicate with Dr. Alvarer Tormo ve MIX have ostablished

As you are aware the Agency financially supported

the AMVORLD "unattributable operations" through ARTIME from

June 1963 through April 1965 at a cost of approximately

seven million dollars.

As of 1 May 1965 CIA with the

concurrence of the 303 Comittee terminated this support:

On 8 June 1965, CIA sent a proposal to the 303

Committee for restoration of support to Manuel ARTIME's

nutononous paramilitary group on a smaller scale for a

totally distinct psychological warfare purpose. This

proposal recommended expenditure of approximately $15,000

monthly diatributed as follows:

Support of MRH officies in U.S.,

Spain,

Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia,

Costa

Ries, Venezuela

Publication of TRIDITS

Radio Broadcasts to Cuba

In September 1965, DC/H/Cuba agreed to the

decision to cut ARTIME's subsidy to $5,000 monthly

(ostensibly for support of dependents and survivors

of MRR dead, wounded and imprisoned), as of l. October

1965. 0f the $5,000 monthly aid, $2,000 according to

ARTIMB was delivered to Father Llorento who in turn

transfered the funds through the official Spanish

pouch to Madrid to a member of the Embassy of Spain in

Havana (QUANTUM-51) •

This official was later declared

ING in Cuba and returned to Spain.

5.

On 4 May 1966, ARTIME was told by his Head-

quarters case officer that effective l June 1966 the

"stipends" to persons inside Cuba, who were allegedly

receiving it through the Spanish Embassy,

would be

terminated.

Therefore,

effective 1 June 1966, ARTIME'g

payments from CIA would be cut to $3,000.

At this time

ARTINE wAS

also advised that strict budgetary. linitations

were now being imposed on

all government spending because

of Viet Nan and other commitments and that it was quite

Ilkely that further cuts or the elimination of the

renaining $3,000 ronthly subsidy would occur in tre not

too distant future. At that time ARTIMB was alao encourared

to seek gainful employment and to encourage anyone who wag

receiving money from him to do likewise.

He was alao told

that the Agency would be willing to assist him in obtaining

legitimate employment or to help him in any necessary

training to obtain 1t.

Since this date ARTIME has continued to receive

the $3,000 monthly subsidy the majority of which he must

mpend for his owu personal expenses as he continues to

travel rather frequently in Central America and maintains

Lle

in Miamt without any other income.

ArTINE's contribution to the Agency's operational

offort against Cuba in the past year has been negligible.

w/Cuba feels that continued payment of the $3,000 subsidy

is not warranted and can no longer be juatified.

In view

of the present budgetary limitation on Cuban operations 1t

osa nell be utilized for more significant and hopefully

ure prodictive activitles.

It 1s not belleved that termination of the

cleared with and bad the approval of the President.

He said

Bowdler said he wanted to make two points complotely clear

to him.

There was no present plan or projected

Planning by the U.S. for military action against

Cuba.

D.

There was a possibility that the U.S.

Government might re-examine the Cuban situation

In the next few months and that he was intorested

In getting Artime's views on the present situation

no well as comments and/or suggestions covering

the future.

Artime sald he told Bowdler that the morale of the

Cuban

exiles and of the people in Cuba was at its lowest ebb.

He said not alonc Castro's opponents but Castro himsalf

through his own sources knew that the only significant

activity belug conducted against his regime at the present

tlue was propagarda radio broadcasts beamod into the is.and

und these were having no effect on the stability of the

Castro regime.

Artime said he volunteered his services as a

mIlitary man in any capacity in which he could possibly

Berve.

He said he spoke

in terms of hit-and-rud and

sabotage raids at several simultaneous points on the

island the purpose of which would be to:

Raise the morale and internal

resistance spirit of the people on the

1sland.

Lead to further economic difficulties

by forcing the government to recall to active

military service,

to man coastal defenses, etc.

military and militia types now working on sugar,

other agricuitural.and industrial production.

Force Castro to maintal his military

establishments in a constant state of alert

thereby creating further financial problems as

well as possible morale problems within the

m1l1tary establishment.

Ile enphasized that these "raids" could be done without

Increasing the budget or taxes.

They could be carried

out by Cubans using equipment and material presently

available to the U.S. Government.

He said Bowdler asked him for his suggestions as

to what could be done in the way of military action aginat

Cuba and he replied that the U.S. Government with its juge.

milltary establishment and experience was much better

qualified than he to make suggestions.

Other topics covered were Castro's verbal attacke

mainst President Fret of Chile and the Alliance for Progress.

7.

Artime said he told Bowdler he was of course very

concerned about future planningif any concerning Cuba as

ho had a wife and family to support and should really

seriously reorganize and reorient his personal life 11

there vere no prospects of some action in the futuro and of

his participation therein.

July 23. 1966

Dear Jim:

I pass the following information to you: l. Colonel

General Manager of Lanica Airlines, has

received a

SANCHEZ iron the ConTanfa Cubana de Aviación, of which 1 am

enclosing photos.atic copies,

and according

to Colonel SANCHEZ

this is

extrenely serious, since this not only represents a

bill of $1,496.00 dollars

which will go into the hands of

CASTRO, but all the Latin American aviation companies will

have to pay a similar bill monthly, which dollars will go to

Cuba.

Colonel SANCIlEZ says that the

seriousness of the problem

does

not stop there.

It is the opinion of the Latin American

airlines that Cubana de Aviación will send each one of these

lines a bill for everything they have not paid since CASTRO

and pot some. lie be a dad thes, have channa heir toures

so as not to pass over Cuba. Colonel SANCHEZ says that if

Fidel collects

this belated bill, it will mean about a million

dollars for him.

2.

According to conversations held with General MONTIEL,

the last three cases of Nicaraguan persons who were trained

in Russia and have re-entered Nicaragua have done so using the

route: Socialist Bloc • Cuba - Mexico - Miami - country of

origin.

The United States visas were obtained in Mexirs and

• were transit visas.

This can throw the Latin American

authorities off.

since no one expects that from Miami could

come anyone coming

from Russia.

The last one captured in Nicaragua (Carl can tell you). from

being interrogated

as to why he had gone up to the U.

Mexico and then to El Salvador and Managua, answered that he

had received orders to do so.

It must be taken

into account that on passing through the

United States with a transit visa these men can give out orders

and watchwords.

The two Nicaraguans with whom I have spoken about

possibly working for our cause, putting the problem to them

something completoly Cuban,

were:

Raúl PALACIO,

law student

intelligent,

It the Central American University. of Managua demonstrations

1ood speaker, crurageous,

has participated in

calist the Government of the SOMOZAs,

and is a nephew of

Deputy MOLINA, who supports him financially and pays for his

schooling.

MOLINA 19 well known as an anti-American, although

in the background ho gets along with the United States Ambas

andor to NicaraguA,

RadI PALACIO told me that he had to think

---

## Page 119

it over carefully, since this could mean the loss of one year

in his career.

Against this position (of his career), I spoke to him about

3o possibility of becoming a great leader of the Nicaraguan

and about possible training abroad in the politicad

econonic, or social field, whichever he would like nost.

The ocher Nicaraguan from

whom I received a message has Gustavo

JARQUIN.

le is a

half-brother of Leticia JARQUIS, who works

with me (they have the same father but not the sane mother).

He sent me the message through a brother of Leticia whose name

is Adán; who also lives in Andaime, Nicaragua.

The nessage

was the

following:

that he wanted to talk to me about some

very interesting things which would benefit me and Cuba.

This man was in Cuba for training, and, it seems. in Kussia.

A militant Communist, it seems that he

has had financial dif

ficulties,

which

the

Party has not helped him out of.

Carl is investigating him before I speak with him.

I am attaching a machine copy of the letter which

Enrique TOUS sent to Manuel GUILLOT, in which he tells about

the matter of Blas ROCA y Narinello.

I am attaching a photostatic copy of a letter received

by Jost GONZALEZ Puig, which gives a good explanation of the

situation in Cuba.

A package was sent from Managua to Cuba, via mexico:

in which were:

one pair of tennis shoes, two undershirts

twe undershores,

four pairs of stockings,

two ladies' brassieres,

eno ladies panties, three bottles of medicine.

We'll see if they receive it in Cuba and when.

on Thursday, July 2og

MI. Elo VALDIVIA SorI, who worked for

in the M.R.R. in Cuba, arrived on one of the flights

to freedom.

He told me:

5.

ElO VALDIVIA SOrI had contacts with Alfredo ALBUERSE, an

electro-mechanical engineer and technician who works at

the

Cuenca Sur (South Basin) in Havana,

in the supplying of water

to the Capital.

This man spoke critically of a relative who.

had gone to the United States and who in his opinion was an

agent of Fidel CASTRO.

This relative who left had been a ser

geant in the Marina de Guerra (Navy) in Cuba in BATISTA'S

time.

Everything seems to coincide with the descrintion of

the ALBUERNE who was a prisoner in the Zenón Viera Base in

Nicaragua®

The engineer Alfredo ALBUERNE is against the Communist regime,:

and although he wants to leave Cuba he is watched carefully

because for the moment the Government does not have a replace-

ment for him in the work that he does in the Cuenca Sur (South

Basin).

He (Elo VALDIVIA Sorf) had contact with Luis VALDIVIA Delgado,

• youth who was won over by the Cumpulsory Military Service

and who now works as an electronics technician in the Microwave

Station on. the Staff of the Armed Forces.

He (Elo VALDIVIA Sorf) had contact with Lizaro FERNANDEZ (he

is not very sure of

the last name), a youth who works

State Security Service in one of the main offices in "old

Havana".

He (Elo VALDIVIA Sorf) brought in the information that Vicente

8.

The radio in Cuba has set me up as an example in the

Cuban

exile novement, and I have

received word that they have

planned,

inside Cuba, to eliminate me:

Due to this, I went to the office of

the sheriff of Dade County

to see about the possibility of obtaining a permit to carry a

which was granted through the intervention of a veteran

Mr. Eric JIMENEZ, who

is now a

detective in the County,

Captain LONGBOTTOM,

(I mentioned

Captain LONGBOTTOM told me that he wanted very much to go to

Central AmeriCa,

since he had never been there before.

I told

nim that 1 would

be very happy to get him a Nicaraguan visa

and that I would be able to put him up, if it were just for a

short time, at the home of any Nicaraguan friend of mine.

My motives

for saying this were:

1. Gratitude for the efforts they have made.

So that the Miami police would realize the con-

sideration and respect that they have for me in these latin

Ameriçan countriese

I even thought about the possibility that some

American agencies had doubts about whether or not I really had,

LONGBOTTON could be a go-between for these agencies.

in Nicaragua I left in a safe in Managua because I was thinking

oe the possibility that it sight occur

to some

feverish sind

to check me out unon my arrival in Miami and find that list

which, except to you, would be very difficult for me to explain.

In effect, when I arrived in Miami,

and after passing through

the formalities of Inmigration and

Custons, two.courteous.in-

vestigators,

one from

the Department of Customs and

the other

fros the Bure su of Narcotics, invited me very delicately to

go into their office to talk

with them.

There they searched

me, and with the greatest courtesy in the world they asted me

he stupidest questions that could be asked of anyone

one of

which

was: if Cantain LONGBOTTON and Eric TIMENEZ beloneed te

the Colod. I don't know whether or not they thought the c.l.A.

and I were waging a private war against CASTRO, or if they

thought the C.l.A. and I were involved in narcotics smuggling.

The search they made of me was rather ineffective.

Since I my-

self opened the secret compartment of my briefcase for them

so that they could see that if I had wanted to smuggle something

I would have done so, but nevertheless I had not done so.

Anyhow, I am going to present my complaints to the Department

of State in Miami, and I shall write a letter to the President

of the United States of America, because I believe that the

least one can do for a triend is to treat him with consideration.

or at least not subject him to any annoyance.

If they had some

doubt about me, I think that there would have been ways much

more courteous

and above all less disagreeable to resolve them.

I want to make it clear that the conduct of these agents was

nt all times courteous.

And it all ended in pleasant chatter

In which I even offered to collaborate with them in everything

which might pertain to their offices, except in that which

ght harm the cause of the liberation of Cuba. I made it very

Clear that I was no? working as an agent of any agency or de-

partment of the United States, and that anytime I

learn some-

thing that might harm the United States or something that has

to do with international Communism,

I would notify old friends

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: AMBIDDY-1

1.

During the course of an operational meeting with

AMBIDDY-1 in Washington, D.C., on 22 June, he raised the

subject of financial payments presently being made to bim

monthly ($3,000) which he claims

is used to help dependents

of AMWORLD mentars whose husbands or providers have been

oither kilied or imprisoned as a result of activities for

AMWORLD.

AMBIDDY-I was specifically interested as to

whethor or not I could give assurances that the mouthl

payments would not be further reduced (they were reduced

from $5,000 a month to $3,000 on l June) or terminated

In the future.

2.

AMBIDDY-1 was advised to consider the matter

from

a strictly realistic point of view; that the original

purpose of the pajments was to tide these people over for

& short period until they could readjust their. lives and

prepare for and obtain gainful employment.

The payments

to his people were never meant to be considered as "pensiong"

and certainly would not be paid indefinitely.

It was pointed

out that with the present heavy financial commitments of

Viet Nam all Government budgets were being closely scrutinized

and all Government agencies were suffering rather extensive

cuts.

AMBIDDY-I was told that although there was no word

at the present tire that his payments might be cut further

or discontinued,

he should certainly prepare his people

now for the possibility and urge them, if they had not

mIready done so, to seek gainful employment.

3.

This conversation led into a discussion concerning

AMBIDDY-l's future.

It was also stressed for his benefit

that he should establish himself in legitimate employment

whore he could provide for himself and his family in the

future.

AMBIDDY-1 claimed that he only had $3,000 in

personal savings and the ANYORLD organization about $12, 600.

He was given & blank PRU #1 and asked to 11l1 it out on big

return

and nail it to the writer.

Although

no commitments

were made he was inld that we were interested in helping aim

Mi:mi, 6 July 1966

Dear Jia:

I wish to communicate the following:

I. The magazine "Tridente" will continue to be published

once a month with as many sacrifices as may be necessary.

because it hurts me to see the way the Batistians have

porten hold of public opinion, trying to knit un

unti-american atmosphere and giving the impression in

their transmissions to Cuba that all those in exile think

the same vay they do. I believe this greately harms any

Internal conspiracy which may exist in Cuba.

3. In my next letter I will send you my complete for.

I received a long distance telephone call from Juan Nufes,

Costa Rica. He cold me that Daniel Oduber wanted to speak

with me as soon as possible because he had important things.

to propose to me ard that what he was going to propose

would benefit me.

•Radio Havana continued to attack me unmercifully. It says

that I have 8,000 volunteers in Nicaragua.

(From an infiltration which I have in the Miami Police

(Dade county), it seems that they knew where Massferrer had

the lot of 200 weapons and when they went to capture Elem

& high official (possibly Major Hill) told them that he

had geceived the order not to touch those weapons from the

cin.

---

## Page 138

Maysferrer has mentioned anong his men that those

weapons were gisen to him by the CIA. The name of the

source of the information was omitted (of the policeman)

for his protection, since he is sure that it may harm him.

The source is reliable.

fo I was able to establish contact with my parents through

my cousin, but still know nothing of the contact requested

by me to be

made within Cuba. My parents expect to mahe

an attempt in obtaining asylum at the Mexican Embassy

in Cuba®

I am sending you a resumé of Rene Cancio, who wishes to

Join the Navy of the United. States to go to Viet-Nam

to fight, since he is unable to do anything in Cuba for

the time being. He is our Chief of Naval Operations and

I consider him a great man..

He worked with your company

for a long time.

8. On 28 June I had an interview with Enrique Huertas, who

tried to convince me to join a group of personalities

_! public scandalfor President Johnson at tho

White House. He thinks that the homage which he himself

has prepared for. 9 July at the Cuban Medical Association,

where a greup of personalitios hava ten invited couid

be the beginning of a scandal of international magnitude

(something like a hunger strike in front of the White House

in Washingzon). Ichnson will find himself obliged to do

something of the Cuban problem because the opposition would

use this in their platform.

---

## Page 139

He says that Edward kennedy sold him that the Cuban problem

had been definitely shelved by President Johnson. I told

him that in my opinion the Cuban problem was in a "freezer"

but not definitely closed, and that there were other ways

to solve this problem; that in my opinion a Texan may yield

with good manners (President Johnson) but not by force.

That my opinion was that if we resort to violence, the

reaction would be anti-productive. That I was of the

Impression that they were conspiring against the North

American Government in the interior of Cuba, and that this.

I had learned from

sources in Cuba. That a violent

manifestation against the America Government could destroy

all active subversive plans because the Cuban soldiers who

were conspiring would lose their faith in the American

Government. Huertas is very hurt due to the culmination

of the Batistians. In my opinion it is because they have

cut a budget which he had. But if all those who have their

budgets cut were to react that way it would be because

they were badly chosen for the position they hold.

One works for principles of for money.

9. I leave fe. Nicaragua and from there will report what

• I find. When I return I will call;

Regards,

Manolo

In recent conversations with AMBIDDY/1 at Head-

quarters, he expressed concern over the extent of former

President Fulgencio Batista's publicity/propaganda activities

are having on the large Cuban exile community.

According to

AMBIDDY/1, the most effective propaganda mediums in the Miami

ares are directed, controlled and financed by

Batista

interests and are designed to rebuild Batiata's image.

He

mentioned specifically Patria which da financed by Batiata,

published once weekly and

has a wide free distribution.

In

addition, reference was made to radio station MIA which

ANBIDDY/l cinimed was the principal station which hroadeast

Batista propaganda programs. AMBIDDY/1 commented that the

regarding AKBIDDY/1 and the fact that he lo anything but an

MEMORANDM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Operational Meetings with AMBIDDY/1, Washingtoi,

D.C., 22-23 June 1966

1.

AUBIDDY /1 was requested to travel from Miami to

Washington, D.C., in a phone call to his residence in

Miami on 20 Tune.

He arrived in D.C. on the afternoon of

22 June.

We met in his hotel room at the Manger Hay-Adams

Hotel the evening of 22 June and later had dinner together.

A round-up meeting was held at noon time ca 23 June after

which AMBIDDY/1 left for New York City on what he termed

"personal business."

2.

The principal reason for bringing ANBIDDY/1 to

Washington was to check out wich him what equipment

Including arme and ammunition-remained from the ANWORLD

activity hore in the States, what it consisted of, where it

was stored and whether or not any of the equipment had been

disposed of recently or whether there had been any recent

Inquiries made to purchase any of the equipment (this inquiry

wal prompted by JMWAVE 1479). These points were taken up

early in the meeting.

3.

AMBIDDY/l said the only equipment reuaining from

the ANWORLD activity in the U.3. is stored in a small closet

1n a farm near West Palm Beach,

Florida. As near as AMBIDDY/1

could reoall, there are 2-3 rubber boats and 6-8 silent out-

board notura

stored

at the farn nothing else.

In addition

his rop'nad no arms or ammunition either from AMWORLD Or

SAENZ, has 6-8 radios at his home in Miami. AMBIDDY/1

personally stored in the U.S. He has one personal sub-machine

gune in hia home.

To his knowledge there are no sizable

mounts of artle arms or ammunition in the Miami ares, elther

in storego or available for

sa?s.

He clained that during

the Guantanano alert he checked to see how many arms he could

locate in the Miant aren if needed and could locate only

about 60 riflos fron anungst the various exile groups.

attention.
