he was giving the Special Group this afternoon a study showing the resuits

of 51 days' reconnaissance over Cuba and that this was disturbing when the

four principal targets were analyzed. There were 59 occasions when

weather precluded any readout of what was going on in these four Soviet

military.camps. Some of the camps were not seen for five or six days in

a row and in one instance for as longas 12 successive days. Mi. McCone

then read from the memorandum on reconnaissance over Cuba dated 23 April

1963 and said he would provide the Board with a copy.

The DCI then reported that James Donovan during a nighttime drive

to Veradero had passed a convoy of 25 very large trucks, the type generally

carried on railroad flatcars. Mr. McCone stated that an examination of the

photography for that day and the following day provided absolutely no trace

of the convoy. Di. Land stated that the DCI's previous statement may have

provided the answer as to where this convoy might be. The DCI said he

planned to recommend low-level flights in order to provide mose information.

10. At this point MI. FitzGerald was asked to give his presentation on

operations in Cuba. He commenced by displaying the chart which indicated

the number of resident agents, illegal teams, legal teams, shipboard agents

and penetrations of Cuban installations.

He noted that the number of illegal

teams had risen to three as a result of a successful operation on Sunday,

and one of these teams had as many as 100 subagents with extensive covrage

in the province of Pinar del Rio. Dr. Langer asked what the subagents were

looking for, and Mr. FitzGerald replied that their coverage was mostly

military. MI. Murphy asked if these agents were all strictly collecting

intelligence, and Mi. FitzGerald replied that this was their primary purpose

at the moment, but the illegals could create a resistance net if this was

desired. He pointed out that the policy at the present time precluded attempt -

ling to develop a large scale dangerous activity.

GERALD R. FORD LIBPARY

Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that the penetration of Cuban installations

were mainly diplomatic installations and that some 14 Cuban diplomats svere

our agents. Mr. Clifford asked how the information was gotten out of Cuba,

and Mi. FitzGerald replied that it was mostly by secret writing transmitted

to Mexico City by mail and then forwarded to Washington. He said there

were four radios in Cuba and that we now had a greatly improved medium

speed transmitter that was quite small, the size of about two cigarette cartons,

and it could get a message off in just 60 seconds. He said that there was a.

smaller and better transmitter currently in the process of development.

DI. Land asked if the loss of this transmitter would compromise others.

MI. Fitz Gerald replied that it would not compromise any other agents

except the one apprehended, and the DCI noted that it would simply com-

promise the instrument.

Mr. Murphy asked concerning the quality of substantive reporting,

and Mr. FitzGerald noted that the 1, 040 reports looked impressive, but it

was quite true that this was not a true indication. He said that some of the

reporting was very good, and there were

payroll who provided some first-rate reports and were closest to the bone

in what Castro was thinking. Mi. Murphy asked if we had Castro's

immediate entourage penetrated and Mr. FitzGerald said his sister worked

for us but that she didn't always have inside information. He pointed out

that the 665 reports from resident agents were primarily on military targets

and the intelligence community felt they were really worthwhile as a supple-

ment to overhead reconnaissance. General Doolittle asked if an illegal

team was two men and Mr. FitzGerald replied "yes". Mi. Murphy asked

whether these agents provided information on Soviet troop strength and

equipment, and Mr. FitzGerald replied in the affirmative. Mi. Clifford

noted that with just two illegal agent teams in Cuba at this time we were

FROM THE

back to where we started from in 1962. Mr. FitzGerald commented that the

casualty rates were very high and referred to the charts "Legal Resident

Agents in Cuba"' and "Illegal Agent Development":

(At this point Mr. McCone left the meeting and Mr. Cottrell came

in. )

Mr. Gray asked if the modest number of agents was a result of

policy or operations. Mr. FitzGerald replied that this was primarily a

LII

result of operations and noted that it was not the result of lack of allort, butte

because of the high attrition rate and the dangers involved. He went over

the lists of what had happened to the agents that were put in. He noted that

it was presently planned to carry out approximately five operations a month.

Mr. Murphy asked if there was evidence of organized resistance in Cuba.

Mr. Fitz Gerald replied "yes", but they were now small bands scattered

throughout the island. He noted that Castro had broken up the large country-

wide resistance networks last summer. He then produced the chart entitled

"Illegal Infiltration -- Exfiltration Operations" and commented on this.

Mr. Murphy asked if the groups on the island committed sabotage, and

Mi. FitzGerald said the policy presently precluded major sabotage operation:

and limited it to "subtle sabotage". Mr. Murphy asked what constituted

"subtle sabotage", and Mr. FitzGerald described it as tying a rock to a wire

and throwing it across high tension lines.

11. The Board then turned to Mi. Cottrell and asked him to describe

the work of his group. Mi. Cottrell said the President had become con-

cerned there were so many government agencies dealing with so many

Cuban groups, and he had set up the group under Mi. Cottrell to coordinate

all of this activity. He said that his immediate group consisted of a repre-

sentative of Defense and CLA, and there were additional committees or

groups reporting to them. He outlined the general policy guidance under

which they were operating and under questioning from Mr. Murphy stoutly

denied that the policy was basically defensive in nature, and it was

directed toward getting rid of communism and Castro in Cuba. It was

further explained that CIA's activities were coordinated through this group.

12. Dr. Killian then asked Bruce Clarke to give a brief report on the

situation in Cuba, and with the aid of photographs Clarke analyzed the

present Soviet troop strength on the island and explained how these figures

were arrived at. At 12:00 this session was recessed to permit the presenta

tion by DIA.
