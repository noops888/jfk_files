Deputy Chief, Security Research Staff 4 March 1966

Thomas A. Ogden

WIECK, Carl

1. On 3 March 1966, Jim Flint of SR Division contacted the
undersigned in reference to an Unknown Identity mentioned in
(PARDE378 :

2o-

2. The cable contained an account of the experiences of

Carl WIECK, an American student in Paris and his contact

with two RIS officers, YEVTUSHENKO and LVOV, - one

3. WHECK has been a contact since the winter of 1964 with
these Soviets and had not reported to anyone in the American
Embassy. The contacta have consisted of restaurant meetings,
coffees, circus, ete. These meetings have included discussions
primarily of political matters, especially recently a discussion
of the United States involvement in Viet Nam (of which WIECK
does not approve, has said so to the Soviets). 7

4. However, when YEVTUSHENKO asked Subject to trans-
late a travel brochure from English to French, WIECK began to
wonder what he was becoming involved in. At this point, WIECK
wrote two friends in the United States asking advice. One of these
was "4 former employee who allegedly did handwriting analysis

whea employed by CIA.” They advised Sr him to contact the United

States Embasay.

5. WIECK refused to do translation for YEVTUSHENKO and
was able to tell YEVTUSHENKO that he, WIECK, did not like the
idea of becoming enmeshed in Soviet espionage.



"SECRET 7

6. Sr posed the question whether the Office of Security
could identify the former Kubark employee. Upon consultation
with Jan Beck of TSD (after contacting the Security Officer of”
TSD), the individual who most closely fit the description was
Henry Edward KIMSEY (even though the handwriting angle was
not KIMSEY's main forte).

7. SR-Flint was notified that it probably was KIMSEY.

8 Flint was also advised that the FBI ehould be notified of
the information re WIECK and WIECK's contacts with the Soviet.
Flint said that this would be done as soon as they had gathered
together all the information. WIECK's next meeting with the Soviet
is scheduled for 17 March 1966. i

9. WIECK hag said that he does not wish to get involved as ©
"a junior spy" and does not desire to report after every meeting.
WIECK also said that he expects to be drafted into the United
States Army quite soon and in view of bis feelings about Viet Nam,
does not know if he will agree to serve in Viet Nam-

10. Another angle to the case is the projected cooperation with
‘the host services and since it is an operational matter will have to
be solved within the DDP. The French probably are already aware
of the contact between YEVTUSHENKO and WIECK because it is
known that they have YEVTUSHENKO under surveillance.

ll. There is no record of WIECK in the Office of Security
indices.
