(cr 976, The Los Angeles Times)
~ } ‘WASHINGTON — At least 20 FBI
‘agents are under federal: investiga-
‘tion for alleged illegal burglaries
:during the last five years — long
tafter the FBI said such so-called
‘black bag jobs ceased; The Los. An-
'geles ‘Times learned Monday. But-
glaries were said to have been con-
ducted against groups and
individuals the FBI considered
, “extrpmists,” primarily in the New
*Yorkiarea.

Thg investigation, cloaked in more

, than"the traditional veil of Justice.

: Department-secrecy, has been under
, way for about two months. J. Stan-
ley Pottinger, assistant attorney
general for civil rights, is said to-be
devoting his primary attention to
the investigation.

Inside the FBI, James B. Adams as-
sistant to.FBI Director’Glarence M. Kel-
ley, has pritne responsibility ‘for the in-
quiry. Adams’ office-said Monday he was

“in transit” and could not bereached:

Pottinger said: “I cannot qmment in.
any direction about it.”

‘Though it could not be estabijghed
whether the matter was already before a
federal grand jury, it was learned: that
some agents had been read their Miran-
da rights ~ the right to remain'silent, to
+have-legolcounsel present during aues~,
tioning and the warning that aa

they say may be used against them.

While a source close to the agents;
maintained the investigation hag been,
focusing-heavily “on the little guy — the j
street (FBI) agent,” another source;
familiar with the matte? contended that {
individuals above the rank of special j
agent could be prosecuted for their part t
in.authovizing break-ins.

The investigation is based on Recon- {
struction-era laws that bar Jaw enforce- |
ment officials from violating a citizen's |
civil rights and the federal law that:
prohibits officers from conducting,
searches without’ warrants. Maxim
punishment under these laws ret
10 years.imprisonment,

Disclosure that black bag jobs were:
conducted ‘hy the FBI within the last five
years is likely for two teasons to shake|
morale within.the agency, which appear-'
ed to be recoyering from. the revelations,
af improper FBI activities by the Senate:
Intelligence Committee. +

One-is the symbolic: specter of Pet
officials-being read theif rights as.poter
tial defendants and being subjecter
‘other trappings of the criminal justi
‘process,

‘The other is that the burglaries took
place sometime within the last five
years, counter to congressional testi.
mony that former FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover called off black bag jobs in 1966.
The existence of much more recent ille-
gal opetations by the FBI is likely to
raise the-question of whetherall-such ac-'
tions have heen finally shut off.

WASHINGTON ~ The revelation’ ‘that

crimes, including break-ins, forgery, ille-
ih gall bugging, violating civil liberties. and
' worse, raises an important question,
Should the people responsible for break-

‘ to jail?”
* _ Roderick Wilcomb, of the “Society to
\ Rehabilitate Wayward G-Men,” says it
F Would be wrong to send’ FBI agents to
i ptison-for crimes committed inthe name

{ of national security.
}

} “Society will not he served by putting

; never had the breaks you-or I had. If 1
t thought punishment was the answer, I
{ would be for it, But there: has to be a

+ Jem than locking the agents.up.”
“What-do-you suggest?” I asked. .
| “We have to teach them: a trade so

"iat kind of a trade?”
“We could teach them how to catch

j could train them im law enforcement
} inethods without breaking the law thein-
selves, Once they learned the trade, they
‘could go out and get jobs and:not Have-to

“That sounds Tike the bleéding-heart

be “Bo you realize that many:of thése men
did-not commit one crime, but went back

' Wilcomb replied, “That’s becatise ‘soci-

“Wilcomb,” I said, “I’m for rehabilita-

lesson. But how can we be sure these
black bag operators and break-in artists
won't go-back to their old tricks once’ ‘you |

“They won't if we teach them skills |

The Honorable Russell B. Long

Senate Office Building
Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator Long:

I have just completed reading the Washington (AP) release dated
4/27/76, in reference to the summation of the Senates Report on
Intelligence Operations.

I am 38 years old and a graduate of the American University School
of Government and Public Administration in Washington, D. C.

I spent fourteen years with the Federal Government (F.B.I. U.S.
Army Security Agency) prior to entering private industry approxi-
mately five years ago.

To say the least, I am appalled at the Senates apparent disregard
for security operations.

I can assure you, a trained intelligence analyst could have all
kinds of data just by reading this report that was published in
the Times - Picayune.

-

Doubtless, intelligence operations develop problems by their mere
nature and no program is free from errors.

I just don't like the idea of my grandchildren, should I have any,
marching down Pennsylvania Avenue with Chairman Mao's book in their
hands.

I am a student of American Government and am very familiar with the
workings on the "Hill'.

In this our BiCentenial Year, our founding fathers would roll over
in their graves if they were aware of the irresponsible disclosures
and revelations coming from. some of our elected bodigs that are

ible for this Great Nati ity. 22 DY ol

is not totally compromised.

the Honorable Clarence M..Kelley, the Director of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

Mr. Kelley was appointed Director in July of 1973 ina
troubled time for the FBI. His experience as an innovative
law enforcement administrator in charge of the Kansas City
Police Department for over ten years, and his previous work as
a Special Agent of the FBI have made him uniquely qualified
to lead the Bureau.

The Select Committee is grateful for the cooperation
extended by Director Kelley in the course of its inquiry over
the past months. The Committee is also impressed by the
openness of the FBI's witnesses before this Committee, and
their willingness to consider the need for legislation to
clarify the Bureau's intelligence responsibility.

It is important to remember from the outset that this
Committee is examining only a small portion of the FBI's
activities. Our hearings have concentrated on FBI domestic
intelligence operations. We have consistently expressed our
admiration and support for the Bureau's criminal investigative
and law enforcement work, and we recognize the vital importance
of counterespionage in the modern world. But domestic
intelligence has raised many difficult questions.

The Committee has also concentrated on the past rather
than on present FBI activities. The abuses brought to light

in our hearings occurred years and even decades before Directoy

Kelley took charge.

The Staff has advised the Committee that under Director
Kelley the FBI has taken significant steps to rethink previous
policies and to establish new safeguards against abuse. The
FBI is now placing greater emphasis on foreign related intelli
gence operations, and less on purely domestic ‘surveillance.

The FBI is working more closely with the Justice Department in
developing policies and standards for intelligence. These
are welcome developments.

Nevertheless, many important issues remain unresolved.
Therefore, we have invited Director Kelley to share with the
Committee his views on some of the considerations the Congress
should take into account in thinking about the future of
FBI intelligence. Among these issues are/whether FBI surveil-|
lance should extend beyond the investigation of persons
likely to commit specific crimes;Zwhether there should be
outside supervision or approval before the FBI conducts certain
types of investigations or uses certain surveillance techniques;

3,whether foreign related intelligence activities should be
strictly separated from the FBI's domestic law enforcement
functions Mana what should be done to the information already
in the FBI files and that which may go into those files in
the future.

The Committee looks forward to a constructive exchange

of views with Director Kelley this morning, with Attorney

STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CLARENCE M. KELLEY,

DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Mr. Kelley. Thank you very much, Senator Church and
gentlemen.

I welcome the interest which this Committee has shown in
the FBI and most particularly in our operations in the intelli
gence and internal security fields.

I share your high regard for the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Throughout my
35 year career in law enforcement you will find the same insis7
tence, as has been expressed by this Committee, upon programs
of law enforcement that are themselves fully consistent with
law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of legislative
oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment as Director of
the FBI and was being considered by the Senate Judiciary
Committee two and one half years ago, I told the members of
that Committee of my firm belief in Congressional oversight.

This Committee has completed the most exhaustive study
of our intelligence and security operations that has ever been
undertaken by anyone outside the FBI other than the present
Attorney General. At the outset, we pledged our fullest
cooperation and promised to be as candid and forthright as
possible in responding to your questions and complying with rok

requests.

9 all major areas of our activities and operations in the national

10 security and intelligence fields.

13 || Congress.

14 As this Committee has stated, these hearings have, of

15 necessity, forcused largely on certain errors and abuses. I
16 credit this Committee for its forthright recognition that the
7 hearings do not give a full or balanced account of the FBI's
18 record of performance.

19 It is perhaps in the nature of such hearings to focus

20 on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments of the
21 organization.

22 The Counterintelligence Programs which have received the

23 lion's share of public attention and critical comment constituted

24 an infinitesimal portion of our overall work.

2 3 3,247 Counterintelligence Programs were submitted to FBI

4 Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this total, 2,370,

5 less than three fourths, were approved.
6 I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247 proposals were
q- being devised, considered, and many were rejected, in an era

8. when the FBI was handling an average of 700,000 investigative

9 matters per year.

10 Nonetheless, the criticism which has been expressed

11 regarding the Counterintelligence Programs is most legitimate

12 and understandable.

13 The question might well be asked what I had in mind when

WARD & PAUL

14 I stated last year that for the FBI to have done less than it
15 did under the circumstances then existing would have been an
16 abdication of its responsibilities to the American people..
17 What I said then, in 1974, and what I believe today, is
18 that the FBI employees involved in these programs did what they
19 felt was expected of them by the President, the Attorney Genes
20 the Congress, and the people of the United States.

21 Bomb explosions rocked public and private offices and

22 buildings; rioters led by revolutionary extremists laid seige

23 to military, industrial, and educational facilities; and
24 killings, maimings, and other atrocities accompanied such
25 acts of violence from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings, men, women,
and children. As is the case in time of peril, whether real or
perceived, they looked to their Government, their elected and
appointed leadership, and to the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies to protect their lives, their property, and their
rights. ;

There were many calls for action from Members of Congress

and others, but few guidelines were furnished. The FBI and othi
law enforcement agencies were besieged by demands, impatient
demands, for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt they had a
responsibility to respond; and in good faith initiated actions
designed to countér conspiratorial efforts of self-proclaimed
revolutionary groups, and to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred in the Counter-
intelligence Programs, and there were some substantial ones,
should not obscure the underlying purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred in the
past and will arise in the future where the Government may welll
be expected to depart from its traditional role, in the FBI's
case, as an investigative and intelligence-gathering
agency, and take affirmative steps which are needed to meet

an imminent threat-to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to be carried
out now, can we truly meet our responsibilities by investigatin
only after the crime has occurred, or should we have the
ability to prevent? I refer to those instances where there is
a strong sense of urgency because of an imminent threat to
human life.

Where there exists the potential to penetrate and disrupt,
the Congress must consider the question of whether or not such
preventive action should be available to the FBI.

These matters are currently being addressed by a task
force in the Justice Department, including the FBI,
and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and controls ca|
be developed in cooperation with pertinent Committees of Congre
to insure that such measures are used in an entirely responsibl|
manner.

Probably the moSt important: question here today is what
EE I can give that the errors and abuses which arose
under the Counterintelligence Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some very sub-
stantial changes have been made in key areas of the FBI's
methods of operations since I took the oath of office as
Director on July 9, 1973.

Today we place a high premium on openness, openness
both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open, frank discussion

in the decision-making process which insures that no future
program or major policy decision will ever be adopted without a
full and critical review of its propriéty.

Participatory management has become a fact in the FBI.

I have made it known throughout our Headquarters and
Field Divisions that I welcome all cuployece ll carera of
position or degree of experience, to contribute their thoughts
and suggestions, and to voice whatever Mererep eae or
reservations they may have concerning any area of our. operations.

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine, and I take
full responsibility for them. “My goal is to achieve maximum
critical analysis among our personnel without in any manner
weakening or undermining our basic command structure,

The results of this program have been most beneficial, to
me personally, to the FBI's disciplined performance, and to
the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the past
were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities outside
the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward Levi's
guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability, in his
own words, "as a ‘lightning rod‘ to deflect improper requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General Levi
instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,

considering the context of the request, I believed presented

the appearances of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I have to the
Attorney General that during my nearly two and one half years a:
Director under two Presidents and three Attorneys General, no
one has approached me or made overtures, directly or otherwise,
to use the FBI for partisan political or other improper
purposes,

I can assure you that I would not for a moment consider
honoring any such request.

I can assure you, too, in my administration of the FBI
I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney General and
the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions, including
those which arise in my continuing review of our operations and|
practices, These are discussed openly and candidly in order
that the Attorney General can exercise his responsibilities
over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the FBI today
is sound. But it would be a mistake to think that integrity
can be assured only through institutional means..

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon the
character of the person who occupies the office of the
Director and every member of the FBI under him.

I am proud of the 19,000 men and women with whom it is

my honor to serve today. Their dedication, their professionalism,

their standards, and the self-discipline which they personally

those benefits are wasted if they do not lead to the next step,
a step that I believe is absolutely essential , a legislative
charter, expressing Congressional determination of intelligence
jurisdiction for the FBI.

Action to resolve the problems confronting us in the

security, and intelligence fields is urgently needed; and it

nor the public can afford to look the other way, leaving it to
the FBI to do what must be done, as too often has occurred in
the past.

This means too that Congress must assume a continuing role
not in the initial decision-making process but in the review of
our performance.

I would caution against a too-ready reliance upon the
courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some proposals that
have been advanced during these hearings would extend the role
of the courts into the early stages of the investigative
process and, thereby, would take over what historically have
been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked, would
seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary and cast
them in a role not contemplated by the authors of our
Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a substitute for Con-
gressional oversight or Executive decision.

The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable determination

of our jurisdiction in the intelligence field, a jurisdictional
statement that the Congress finds | to be responsive to both
the will and the needs of the American people.

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police officer, a
career police officer. In’my police experience, the must

frustrating of all problems that I have discovered facing

law enforcement in this country, Federal, state, and local, is
when demands are made of them to perform their traditional
role as protector of life and property without clear and
understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a legislative
charter will be a most precise and demanding task.

It must be sufficiently flexible that it does not stifle
the FBI's effectiveness in combating the growing incidence
of crime and violence across the United States. That charter
must clearly address the demonstrated problems of the past;
yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times change and

so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive’

The fact that the Department of Justice has commenced
the formulation of operational guidelines governing our
intelligence activities does not in any manner diminish the nee
for legislation. The responsibility for conferring juris-
diction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals which

question the need for intelligence gathering, “suggesting that
information needed for the prevention of violence can be
acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations,

Asa practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation may
well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But there
are some fundamental differences between these investigations

that should be recognized, differences in scope, in objective

and in the time of initiation. ‘In the usual criminal case, a
erime has occurred and it remains only for the Government to
identify the perpetrator and to collect sufficient evidence
for prosecution. Since the investigation normally follows
the elements of the crime, the scope of the inquiry is
limited and fairly well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves the gathering of
information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose may well ne
not to prosecute, but to thwart crime or to insure that the
Government: has enough information to meet any future crisis
or emergency. ‘The inquiry is necessarily broad because it
must tell us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent on

our anticipation of those criminal acts, Anticipation,

in turn, is dependent on advance information, that is, intelli-
gence.

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on these issues.
Given the opportunity, I am confident that the continuing need
for intelligence work can be documented to the full satisfaction
of the Congress. We recognize that what is at stake here is not
the interests of the FBI, but rather the interests of every
citizen of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee or
its successors in this important task.

In any event, you have my unqualified agsurance as
Director that we will carry out both the letter and the spirit
of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

That is the substance of my prepared statement.

I would also like to say extemporaneously that I note
that on this panel are some gentlemen who were on the Judiciary
Committee Which heard my testimony at the time I was presented
to them for candidacy as Director of the FBI. At that time
I took very seriously the charge which may possibly result
in the deliberation of this Committee and of the full Senate.
I have been well aware of the problems of the FBI since that
time. I have also been well aware of the capabilities of

the FBI to discharge those responsibilities. I don't take

them lightly. I am of sufficient experience and age that I
have pledged myself to do what is good and proper. I say this
not as a self-serving statement Bee in order that we might
place in context my position within the FBI. I could seek
sanctuary and perhaps a safe sanctuary by saying during the
period these things occurred I was with the local police~
department in Kansas City, Missouri. Prior to that time,

however, I was in the FBI.

During the time I was with the FBI, during the time I
was with the police department, I continued throughout that
period a close acquaintance with and a strong affection for
the FBI.

I only want to point out that based on those years, based
on those observations, we have here a very fine and very
sensitive and a very capable organization. I feel that there
is much that can still be done. I know that we are not without
fault. I know that from those experiences I have had. .We
will not be completely without fault in the future. But I
assure you that we look upon this inquiry, we look upon any
mandate which you may feel you have, that you should look at -p
this is good and proper, and we do not intend -~ I only want
to place in your thinking the fact that you have here a
matchless organization, one which I continue to say was
not motivated in some of these instances, and in most of

them, and I cannot justify some, that the motivation was of the

Senator Hart of Michigan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Mathias and I have Judiciary Committee hearings at 10:3!
Iahve several questions, and I'm sure they'll be
covered by others, but the ones that I have is a result of
reading your testimony and listening to it this morning, and
it relates to your comment at the foot of iG and at the

top of ll.

There you are indicating that you caution us about
extending the court's role in the early stages of investigation6
suggesting that this might take us beyound the role comtemplate
for the courts under the Constutution.

Now as you have said, aside from the so-called national
security wiretap problem, the main focus of our discussions
and concern has been on the possibility requiring court
approval for the use of informants, informants directed to
penetrate and report on some group.

= And one of the witnesses yesterday, Professor Dorsen,
pointed our that really those informants are the most pervasive
type of an eavesdropping device. It is a human device. It's
really, an informant is really more intrusive on my privacy
than a bug or a tap because he can follow me anywhere. He
can ask me questions to get information the government would
like to have.

Now we certainly involve the courts in approval of the

wiretaps for physical searches with the intent of the drafters

of the Constitution to have a‘ neutral third party magistrate
screen use of certain investigative techniques. And the
informant is such a technique. He functions sort of like a
general warrant, and I don't see why requiring court approval

would violate the role envisaged for the courts.

And as I leave, I would like to get your reactions to
my feelings.

Mr. Kelley. I do not feel that there is any use of the
informant in intrusion, which is to this extent objectionable.
It has of course been approved, the concept of the informant,
by numerous court decisions.

Let us go down not to the moral connotation of the use
of the informant.

I think, as in many cases, that is a matter of balance.
You have only very few ways of solving crimes. You have
basically in the use of the informant, I think, the protectiqn
of the right of the victim to be victimized. You have within
the Constitution certain grants that are under ordinary
circumstances abrogation of rights. The right of search and
seizure, which, of course, can't be unreasonable, but none-
theless, you have “the right.

I think that were we to lose the right of the informant,
we would lose to a great measure our capability of doing our
job.

Now I'm not arguing with you, Senator, that it is not an

unusual procedure. I'm not even going to say that it is not
an intrusion, because it is. But it has to be one I think
that is by virtue of the benefits must be counted.

We don't like to use it. We don't like the problems that
are attendant. We take great care.

Now you say about the court having possibility taking
jurisdiction over them and guiding. I think that possibly we
could present the matter to the court but what are they going
to do insofar as monitoring their effort? Are they going to
have to follow it all the way through?

Also, there is, of eal urgency in the other contacts.
Must the court be contacted for each and approval of the court
given for each contact?

There are a great many problems insofar as administration
of it.

I frankly feel, and again, all I can do is give you my
idea -- I frankly feel that there is a satisfactory control ovey
the informants as we now exercise it today. Yes, there are
going to be some who will get beyond our control, but this
is going to happen no matter what you do.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I appreciate your
reaction,

I was not suggesting that there is consideration here :to
prohibit informants. I was reflecting a view that I felt and

hold that the use of an informant does require some balance, as

you yourself said, and I would be more comfortable with a
third party making a judgment as to whether the intrusion is

warranted by the particular circumstance. But I do understand

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hart.

(Senator Hart leaves the hearing room.)

The Chairman. Senator Baker, do you have questions?

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.

Mr. Kelley, I have a great respect-for you and your
organization and I personally regret that the organization is
in political distress, but we've both got to recognize that
it is, along with other agencies and departments of the
government.

I think you probably would agree with me that even though
that is extraordinarily unpleasant and in many respects
unfortunate, that it also has a plus side. That is, it gives
us an indication of our future direction and the opportunity,
at least, to improve the level of competency and service of
the government itself.

With that hopeful “note, would you be agreeable then to
volunteering for me any suggestions you have on how to improve
the responsiveness of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or
indeed, for any other law enforcement agencies of the government,

to the Congress, to the Attorney General, to the President, and

beyond that, would you give me any suggestions you have on
how you would provide the methods, the access, , the documents,
the records, the authority, for the Congress to perform its
essential, I believe, essential oversight responsibility to
see that these functions, these delicate functions are being
undertaken properly?

And before you answer, let me tell you two or three thing
I am concerned about.

It hasn't been Jong ago that the FBI Director was not
even confirmed by the Senate of the United States. I believe
you are the first one to be confirmed hy the Senate of the
United States. I think that is a movement in the right
direction, I think the FBI has taken on a stature that, an
additional importance that requires it to have closer supervisipn
and scrutiny by us.

At the same time I rather doubt that we can become
involved in the daily relationship between you and the Attorney
General.

Therefore, I tend to believe that the Attorney General
needs to be more directly involved in the operations of the
FBI,

I would appreciate any comments on that.

Second, I rather bekieve that major decisions of the
intelligence community and the FBI ought to be in writing, so

that the Congress can, if it needs to in the future, take a

look at these decisions and the process by which they were
made to decide that you are or you are not performing your
services diligently.

I don't think you can have oversight unless you have
access to records, and in many cases records don't exist
and in some cases the people who made those decisions are now
departed and in other cases you have conflicts.

How would you suggest: then that you improve the quality
of service of your agency? How would you propose that you

increase the opportunity for oversight of the Congress of the

- United States? What other suggestions do you have for improvin

the level of law enforcement in the essential activity that
is required? ,

Mr. Kelley. I would possibly be repetitious in answering
this Senator, but I get a great deal of pleasure from telling
what I think is necessary and what I hope that I have followed,
one which is beyond my control, but which I think is very
important is that the position of Director, the one to which
great attention should be paid in choosing the man who will
properly acquit himself.

I feel that the Judiciary Committee, at least in going
over me, did a pretty good job. I feel that it is most
necessary that care be taken that his philosophy, his means
of management, his facility to adapt to change, his tendency

toward consulting with other members of the official family,

Senator Baker. Mr. Kelley, Attorney General Levi, I

believe, has already established some sort of agency or
function within the Department that is serving as the equivaleni
I suppose, of an Inspector General of the Justice Department,
including the FBI.

Are you familiar with the steps that Mr . Levi has
taken in that respect? I think he calls it the Office of
Professional Responsibility.

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir, I'm familiar with it.

Senator Baker. Do you have any comment on that? Will
you give us any observations as to whether you think that
will be useful, helpful, or whether it will not be useful or
helpful, how it affects the FBI, how you visualize your
relationship: to it in the future?

Mr. Kelley. I don't object to this, which is to some
extent an oversight within the Department of Justice under the
Attorney General.

Frankly, it just came out. I have not considered it
completely, but to the general concept, yes, I very definitely
subscribe.

Senator Baker. How would you feel about extending that
concept of government-wide operation, a national Inspector
General who is involved with an oversight of all of the
agencies of government as they interface with the Constitutional]

protected rights of the individual citizen? Would you care

to comment on that, or would you rather save that for a while?

Mr, Kelley. I would like to reserve that one.

Senator Baker. I'm not surprised. Would you think about
it and let us know what you think about it?

Mr, Kelley. I will..

Senator Baker. All right. Mr. Chairman, thank you very
much.

The Chairman, Senator Huddleston.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Kelley, you deseribe on page 4 the conditions that
existed when much of the abuse that we have talked about during
this inquiry occurred, indicating that the people within the
Bureau felt like they were doing what was expected of them
by the President, by the Attorney General, the Congress and
the people of the United States.

Does not this suggest that there has Fala a reaction
there to prevailing attitudes that might have existed in the
country because of certain circumstances Yather than any
clear and specific direct instructions that might have been
received from proper authorities? And if that is the case,
is it possible in developing this charter, this guideline,
to provide for that kind of specific instruction?

Mr. Kelley. I think so, yes. I think that they can

logically be incorporated and that -~

Senator Huddleston. You can see there would be a continuing)

10 court in determining what action might he proper and specific -

14 For instance, supposing we do establish the fact, as

15 has already been done, that informants are necessary and

in many cases it has gone beyond what would appear to have been
necessary to have addressed the original threat.

How do veces within the proper balance there?

Mr. Kelley. Well,.actually, it's just about like any
other offense. It is an invasion of the other individual's
right and it is by an officer and an FBI cers is an officer.
There's the possibility of criminal prosecution against him.

This is one which I think might flow if he counsels”
the informant.

Now insofar as his inability to ‘control the informant,

I don't suppose that would warrant prosecution, but there is
still supervisory control over that agent and over that
informant by insisting that control is exercised on a continuing
basis.

Senator Huddleston. It brings up an interesting point
as to whether or not a law enforcement agency ought to be
very alert to any law violations of its own members or anyone
else.

If a White House official asks the FBI or someone to do
something unlawful, the question seems to me to occur as to
whether or not that is not a violation that should be reported
by the FBI.

Mr. Kelley. I think that any violation which comes to
our attention should either be handled by us or the proper

authority.

5 The ofiginal thrust of my questjon was, even though we
6 May be able to provide guidelines of a broad nature, how do
7 we control the techniques that might be used, that int themselvds
8 might be used, that in themselves might be a serious violation

9 of the rights.
10 Mr. Kelley. Well, first, I don't know whether it's
11 germane to your question but I do feel that it should be pointdd

12 out that the association to, the relationship between the

WARD & PAUL

13 informant and his agent handler is a very confidential one,
14 and I doubt very seriously whether we could have any guide~

19 violations of the law on the part of informants, and either
20 prosecuted ourselves, through the reporting of it to the
21 United States Attorney, or turned it over to the local authority.
22 We have done this on many a time, many occasions. Insofar
23 as our own personnel, we have an internal’organization, the

Senator Huddleston. But it could be helped by periodic
review.

Mr. Kelley. We do, on an annual basis, review the
activities of our 59 offices through that same Inspection
Division, and they have a clear charge to go over this as well
as other matters.

Senator Huddleston. Mr. Kelley, you pointed. out the
difference in the approaches when gathering intelligence, in
gathering evidence after a crime has been committed.

Would there be any advantage, or would it be feasible to
attempt to separate these functions within the a in the
departments, for instance, with not peer a mixing of
gathering intelligence and gathering evidence? Are the techni
definable and different?‘

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think they are compatible. I
see no objection to the way that they are now being handled
on a management basis. I think, as a matter of fatt, it is
a very fine association whereby the intelligence, stemming as
it does from a substantive violation, is a natural complement.

Senator Huddleston. Now, another area, the FBI furnishes
information to numerous government agencies.

Is this properly restricted and controlled at the present
time in your judgment as to just who can ask the FBI for

information, what kind of information they can ask for, and

probably even more importantly, what restrictions can be put
on the use of that information once it has been supplied by
the FBI? eerie i

Mr. Kelley. I think so, Senator.

Senator Huddleston. You think there are proper restrictidns
now?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know that we can ourselves judge
in all cases whether or not there is good and sufficient reason
for an Agency to inquiry. I think that there should be a
very close delineation by the agencies as to what they're
going to ask for, but I think that we do have sufficient rules
that at least to us we are satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. You're confident that the information
your agency supplies is not being misused, to the detriment
of the rights of any individuals.

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I'm only confident in what I
do myself. I would say that I am satisfied.

Senator Huddleston. I was wondering whether some
inclusion ought to be made in whatever charter is made as to
who specifically can request, what limits ought to be placed
on what the request, and what they can do with it after they
get it.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Senator Huddleston. I have some concern about the fact

that in intelligence gathering, you gather, you are just

bound to gather a great deal of information about some
individual that is useless as far as the intent of the intelli-
gence gathering is concerned, but might be in some way embarras
sing or harmful to the individual, whether or not there's any
effort to separate this kind of information out of a person's
file that is really initiated for a purpose, for a specific
purpose unrelated to this information.

Is there any effort, or could any direction be given to
doing that?

Mr. Kelley. We would be very happy to work under the
guidelines or rules or anything else to purge material which
is extraneous, irrelevant, or for any other reason objection-
able.

Senator Huddleston, And how about the length of time
that these files are kept in the agency?

Mr. Kelley. We are willing to work within that framework,
too.

i Senator Huddleston. I think that might be done.

Now, I think in developing the chain of command, so to
speak, it certainly would be very difficult to prevent the
President of the United States from calling up the head of
the FBI or anyone else and discussing any law enforcement
problem he might so desire, and perhaps even give direction
to the agency.

But how about that? What about White House personnel

informants. We'll discuss techniques, we'll discuss our
present activities. I think this, is the only _ that we can
exchange our opinions and get accomplished what you want to
accomplish and what I want to accomplish.

Senator Huddleston. I feel that is an important aspect
of it because even though you have a charter which gives broad
direction for all the guidelines and to the types of projects
that enter into it, if we don't get down to specifics, such
things as how intelligence is to be collected, how evidence
is to be collected, what is done after it is collected, this
type of thing, it seems to me we are leaving a wide gap
again for the Bureau to assume that it has total instruction
and total permission to move in a certain direction and go
beyond what is intended or what was authorized.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Director.

The Chairman. Senator Goldwater?

Senator Goldwater. Mr. Kelley, as part of the FBI
electronic surveillance of Dr. King, several tapes of
specific conversations, and later a composite King tape were
produced.

Are these tapes still in the possession of the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by you?

Mr. Kelley. No, sir.

Senator Goldwater. Have they been reviewed by any of crt

staff, to your knowledge?

Mr. Kelley. Senator, I think that they have been reviewed]
I know that at least some have reviewed it within the area of
this particular section. There has been no review of them
since I came to the FBI, I can tell you that.

Senator Goldwater. Would these tapes be available to
the Committee if the Committee felt they would like to hear
them?

Mr. Kelley. This, Senator Goldwater, is a matter which is
of, as I said before, some delicacy, and there would have to i
be a discussion of this in an executive session.

The Chairman. I might say in that connection that the
Committee staff gave some consideration to this matter and
decided that it would compound the original error for the
staff to review the tapes, because that would be a_ still
further invasion of privacy, and so the staff refrained from
insisting on obtaining the tapes, believing that it was
unnecessary, and quite possibly improper, in order to get at
what.we needed to know about the King case.

So the staff did refrain, and for that reason the issue
never came to a head. I just wanted to lay that information
before the Senator.

Senator Goldwater. I realize that's a prerogative of
the staff, but it's also the prerogative of the Committee if,

and I'm not advocating it, if we wanted to hear them to

ourselves whether Mr. Hoover was off on a wild goose chase
or whether aes was, in effect, some reason. Again, I am
not advocating it, I am merely asking a question. They would
be available if the Committee took a vote to hear them and
decided on it.

Mr. Kelley. I don't think it would be within my juris-—
diction to respond to this, Senator. It would have to be the
Attorney General.

Senator Goldwater. I see.

Now, are these tapes and other products of surveillance
routinely retained even after an individual ceased to be a
target of inquiry?

Mr. Kelley. They are retained usually for ten years.

Senator Goldwater. Ten years.

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

Senator Goldwater. What is the future value, if any,
to the Bureau of retaining such information?

Mr. Kelley. If there be guidelines that set out a
destruction or erasure,we will abide by it. We will, on those
occasions where we think that matters might come up within
that period of time which may need the reténtion of them, we
will express our opinion at that time, but other than that
we would be guided by guidelines.

Senator Goldwater. Is it your view that legitimate

law enforcement needs should outweigh privacy considerations

with respect to retention of such information, or do we need
the clear guidelines on the destruction of these materials
when the investigation purposes for which they were collected

have been served?

Mr. Kelley. We feel that there should be a good close
look at the retention of material, and we would of course like

to have an input. But we welcome consideration of this.

Senator Goldwater. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you very much.

The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

Senator Mondale?

Senator Mondale. Mr. Director, it seems to me that the
most crucial question before the Congress is to accept the
invitation of the FBI to draw Congressionally imposed lines,
limits of authority so the FBI will know clearly what you can
and cannot do, so you will not be subject to later judgments,
and the question is, where should that line be drawn?

As you know, in 1924 when the FBI was created, and
Mr. Stone later became the Chief Justice, he drew the line at
criminal law enforcement. He said that never again will we
go beyond the authority-imposed upon us to get into political
ideas. We will stay in the area of law enforcement.

Would you not think it makes a good deal of sense to
draw the guidelines ina way that your activities are

restricted to the enfoncement of the law, investigations of

erime, investigations of conspiracies to commit crime rather
than to leave this very difficult to define and control area
of political ideas?

Mr. Kelley. I don't know whether I understand your last
statement of involving the area of political ideas. I-say that
I feel that certainly we should be vested and should continue
in the field of criminal investigations as an investigatory
objective. These are conclusions, of course, which are based
on statutes in the so-called security field, national or
foreign.

These are criminal violations. I feel that they should
be in tandem. I feel, having worked many years in this
atmosphere, that you have more ears and eyes and you have
more personnél working together, covering the same fields..

I do not think there should be a separation of the intelligence
Matters, because it is a concomitant. It naturally flows

from the investigation of the security matters and the
eriminal.

Senator Mondale. Mr. Kelley, what:'Mr. Stone said was-
this, that the Bureau of investigation is not concerned
with political or other opinions of individuals. It is
concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws
of the United States. When the police system goes beyond
these limits, it is dangerous to proper administration of

justice and human liberty.

Do. you object to that definition?
Mr. Kelley. I think that life has become much more

sophisticated and we have added to the so-called policeman's

area of concern some matters which were probably not as important

at that time. I think that the fact that the FBI has been in
touch with the security investigations and the gathering of
intelligence is something which has proved to be at times
troublesome and given us great concern, but it is a viable,
productive procedure.

I don't know what Mr. Stone was thinking of entirely
of this course, but I can tell you about the procedure today.

Senator Mondale. You see, I think you recognize, if
that further step is taken, as you're recommending here, that
at that point it becomes so difficult to guarantee, and in
fact, in my opinion, impossible to guarantee that we won't
see a recurrence of some of the abuses that we've seen in
the past, and I don't know how you establish any kind of
meaningful oversight on a function as nebulous as the one
you've just defined.

If the FBI possesses the authority.to investigate
ideas that they consider to be threats to.this nation's
security, particularly in the light of the record that we have
seen how that definition can be stretched to include practi-
cally everybody, including moderate civil rights leaders,

war dissenters and so on, how on earth can standards be develo

that would provide any basis for oversight? :

How can you, from among other things, be protected from
criticism later on that you exceeded your authority or didn't
do something that some politician tried to pressure you into
doing?

Mr. Kelley. It might well be, Senator, that ten years
from now a Director of the FBI will be seated here and will be
criticized for doing that which today is construed as very
acceptable.

Senator Mondale. Correct. And I have great sympathy
for the predicament the FBI finds itself in.

Mr. Kelley. And the Director.

Senator Mondale. And the Director especially, and that is
why I think it's in the interest of the FBI to get these lines
as sharply defined as possible, so that when you are pressured
to do things, or when, after the fact, people with good 20/20
hindsight can criticize you or the Bureau, that you can say
well, here are the standards that you gave us, and they specifi¢-
ally say this, and that is your answer. We have to live by
the law. If we don't define it specifically,it seems to me
that these excesses could reoccur, because I don't think it's
possible to define them, and the FBI is inevitably going to
be kicked back and forth, depending on personal notions of what
you should have done.

Don't you fear that?

1 Mr. Kelley. Not too much, Senator. I think we learned a
2 great lesson by virtue of Watergate, the revelations that have

3 come up as a result of this Committee's inquiries, the fact

Phone (Area 202) 544-6000

4 that I think that we have a different type of spirit today

5 in the Bureau, the fact that, as I said before. you came in,

| 7 are eager to do that which is vital and proper, and the fact
8 that we are getting a number of very fine young people in the
9 organization, people of the other ethnic backgrounds than we
10 had years ago. I think there is a greater understanding in
aa the Bureau today of what is the proper type of conduct.

12 We may not be able to project this on all occasions,

13 || because we must equate this with the need and with our

14 experience, but if the precise guidelines be the goal, you're
15 going to have trouble. If, on the other hand, there be a

16 flexibility, I think that we can work very well within those

18 Senator Mondale. I think, as you know, I don't think
a there is a better trained or higher professionally qualified
20 || law enforcement organization in the world than the FBI. I
21 think we all agree it is superb. But the problem has been,
22 from time to time, that when you go beyond the area of

Senator Mondale. There's no such right in the Consti-

Did you mean to go beyond that?

Senator Mondale. That you should be able to go beyond
that?

Mr. Kelley. No, no. I do not mean that we should ever
go beyond a Constitutional right guarantee.

Senator Mondale. Well, would you say, Mr. Kelley, that
that sentence might have been inartful in your speech?

Mr. Kelley. I said that if it was misunderstood, I

made a mistake, because I should never make a statement which 4

yes, it was inartful.

law enforcement well enough to tell you that I think you were
saying something different, that it was taken to mean something
different than I think you intended.

enforcement powers, the rights of individuals is determined
by the laws and the courts, but the courts, in the handling
of those issues, have to balance rights and other values.

That's what you're essentially saying, is that correct?

Assistant Attorney General asking our cooperation in carrying
out the investigation or their efforts to review the investi-
gation conducted by the FBI into the death of Martin Luther
King, Jr., in order to determine whether that investigation
should be re-opened. They asked our cooperation, they asked
for our transcripts, the testimony before the Committee, all
material provided to the Committee by the FBI which relates
to Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

I guess my question is this: Why is the Justice Depart-

ment asking this Committee for FBI files?

I repeat the question. Why is the Justice Department
asking this Committee for material provided to us by the

Mr. Kelley. Frankly, I don't know. Do you mind if I
just ask --

Mr. Kelley. I am informed, and I knew this one.

Senator Hart of Colorado. So there's nothing you
provided us that's not available to the Justice pepartment?

an official of the Justice Department would ask this Committee
for your records?

Mr. Kelley. No, sir.

Now we had an FBI informant in the other day before this

8 Committee and he stated he told the FBI on a number of

9 occasions he planned violent acts against black people in
10 groups. And yet, he said few, if any, instances in which the
il FBI actually prevented violence from taking place.

12 How does his testimony square with your statement that

Now the Committee has received testimony that the New

authorities, the Attorney Gereral and Congress.

Do you have any information in this regard?

I know in that statement you cite onw or two instances,
but in terms of the bulk of COINTEL programs, the record
seems to date at least to be clear that there was not systematic
information flowing upward through the chain of command to
Director Hoover's superiors?

Mr. Kelleyi May I ask that I be given the opportunity
to substantiate that with documentation?

Senator Hart of Colorado. “sure.

Mr. Kelley; Or respond to it.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Dorector Kelley, just in
passing, do you agree with the statement made by President
Ford that those responsible for harassing and trying to destroy
Dr. King should be brought to justice.

Mr. Kelley. Those who directly responsible and upon whese orders
the activities were taken responsible. I don't know if he intended to say
that, but if he did not, I would say that it would be more proper. ‘Insofar

Director Kelley, in the Committee's review of the
COINTELPRO program and other political involvements of the
FBI, it seems to me that we have encountered two or three
basic questions.

Since the investigation is over insofar as the Committee
is concerned, we're now turning our attention to remedies for
the future, what I would think would be our constructive
legislative work, it Ee very important that we focus on what
we learned in that investigation.

ana one thing that we have learned is that Presidents of

the United States have from time to time ordered the FBI to

obtain for them certain kinds’ of information by exercising the
necessary surveillance to obtain .and to have a purely
political Bhaeaceen! that they simply wanted to have for their
own personal purposes.

I think that you would agree that that is not a proper
function of the FBI, , and you agree.

Yet it's awfally difficult for anyone in the FBI,
including the Director, to turn down a President of thé United
States if he receives a direct order from the President. It
is always possible, of course, to say no, and if you insist,

I will resign. But that puts a very hard burden on any man
serving in your position, particularly if the President puts
a good face on the request and makes it sound plausible or
even invents some excuse. It is alwavs easy for him to say,
you know, I am considering Senator White for an important
position in my administration, and I need to know more about
his activities, particularly of late. I've had some cause
for concern and I want to be certain that there is nothing in
his record that would later embarrass me, and I just want you
to keep careful track of him and report to me on what he's
been doing lately.

It's difficult for you to say back to the President, Mr.
President, that's a very questionable activity for the FBI,
and I frankly don't believe that you've given me the real

reason why you want this man followed. I think his opposition

to your current policy is politically embarrassing to you and
you want to get something on him..

I mean, A know, the Director can hardly talk back that
way, and I'm wondering what we cauld do in the way of protectin
your office and the FBI from political exploitation in this
basic charter that we write.

Now, I want your suggestions, but let's begin with one
or two of mine, I would like your response.

If we were to write into the law that any order-given you
either by the President or by the Attorney General should be
transmitted in writing and should clearly state the objective
and purpose of the request and that the FBI would maintain
those written orders and that furthermore ‘they would be
available to any oversight committee of the Congress, If the
joint committee on intelligence is established, that committee
would have access to such a file.

So that the committee itself would be satisfied that
orders were not being given to the oH that were improper or
unlawful.

What would you think of writing a provision of that kind
into a charter for the FBI?

Hr. Kelley. I would say writing into the law any order
issued by the President that is a request for action by the
Attorney General should be in writing, is certainly, in my

opinion, is a very plausible solution. I'm sure that in

contemplation of this there would be some that will say yes
or some that will say no, but I think we could define an
area where you are trying to cure the abuses and we could
do that.

Now as to the availability to any oversight committee
of Congress, I would say generally that I certainly would have

no objection to this, but I again, there may be some request

for something of high confidentiality that the President might
put in writing such as some national or foreign security
matter.

I would like to have such a consideration be given a
great deal of thought and that the oversight committee review
be conditioned with that possibility. I don't think it would
present a problem.

I have said previously that I feel I can discuss every-
thing except the identity of the informants to the oversight
committee. I welcome that.

The Chairman. Well, that has been of course the way we
proceeded with this Committee. It has worked pretty well,

I think. ,

Now Senator Goldwater brought up a question on the
Martin Luther King tapes. I would like to pursue that question]

If these tapes do not contain any evidence that needs
to be preserved for ongoing criminal investigations, and since

Dr. King has long since been violently removed from the scene,

why are they preserved? Why aren't they simply destroyed?

Is there a problem that we can help through new law to enable
the FBI to remove from its files so much of this information
that is has collected that it is no longer needed or may never
have connected the person with any criminal activity?’ And
yet, all of that information just stays there in the files
year after year,

What can we do? How can a law be changed? If that's
not the problem, then what is? ‘Why are these tapes still down
there at the FBI?

Mr. Kelley. Well, of course, we do have the rule that
they are maintained ten years. Now why the rule is your
question and why right now are they maintained? Since we
do maintain everything since the inquiry has started and until
that's lifted, we can't destroy anything.

I would say that this is a proper area for guidelines

some flexibility and I know that's a broad statement but there

might he some areas wherein that the subject of the investigation
himself may want them retained because it shows his innocence.
I think you have to deliberate this very carefully, but
it can he done and we an willing to be guided by those
rules,
The Chairman, Let me ask you this. The FBI is conducting

thousands of investigations every year on possible appointees

to Federal positions. As a matter of fact, the only time I
ever see an FBI agent is when he comes around and flashes his
badge and asks me a question or two about what I know of Mr.
so and so, who's being considered for an executive office.

And we have a very brief conversation in which -I tell him that
as far as I know, he's a loyal and patriotic citizen, and that
is about the extent of it.

Then when this file is completed and the person involved
is either appointed or not appointed, what happens to that
file? I know it's full of all kinds of gossip because it is
in the nature of the investigation to go out to his old
neighborhoods and talk to everybody who might have known him.

What happens to the file? Is that just retained forever?

Mr. Kelley. We have some capability of destroying some
files and they are rather lengthy insofar as retention. We
have some archival rules which govern the retention of mateial
and is developed in cases involving certain members of the
Executive Branch of the government.

I see no reason why this would not be a proper area
for consideration of legislation. :

The Chairman. Can-you give me any idea of how much -~
do you have records that would tell us how Tech time and money
is being spent by the FBI just in conducting these thousands
of routine investigations on possible Presidential appointments

to Federal offices?

I have often wondered whether we couldn't eliminate
routine Federal offices that are not particularly sensitive
in the national security sense from the reach of these FRI
checks.

And so when you respond to the series of questions, I
wish you would include the offices that are now covered by
such checks and give us an idea of how far down into the
Federal bureaucracy this extends.

Could you do that?

Mr. Kelley. Yes, sir.

fhe Chairman, Fine.

Now there is a vote. The vote always comes just at
the wrong time, but Mr. Schwarz wants to ask you some additiona]l
questions for the record, and there may be other questions,
too that would be posed by the staff, after which I will ask
Mr. Schwarz to adjourn the hearings. It looks like we're going
to be tied up on the floor with votes.

But before I leave I want to thank’ you for your testimony,

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Kelley, I'll try to be very brief.

On page 5 of your: statement ail

Mr. Kelley. What?

Mr. Schwarz. On page 5 of your statement, the third
full paragraph, you said the following, and I would like then
to question about what you said. "We must recognize that
situations have occurred in the past and will arise in the
future where the Government may well be expected to depart from
its traditional role, in the FBI's case, as an investigative
and intelligence-gathering agency, and take affirmative steps
which are needed to meet an imminent threat to human life or
property."

Now, by that you mean to take what kind of steps in what
kind of situation?

And can you give some concrete examples under your general
principles statement?

Mr. Kelley. I think that Mr. Adams addressed himself to
that the other day, where you have an extremist who is an
employee at the waterworks, and he makes a statement that he's
going to do something which is devastating to the city, and you
have no way to attack this under the ordinary procedures, and
so therefore you must take some steps to meet that imminent
threat to human life or property.

Mr. Schwarz. So let us take that case as a test of the

principle. You are saying the extremist has said he is going

to do something to the waterworks, poison it or something, and
hhe is on the way down there with the poison in his car.

Is that the presumption?

Mr. Kelley. We hadn't gone that far, but all right, you
can extent it.

Mr. Schwarz. All right, now, in that case you have the
traditional law enforcement tool, which is the power of arrest.
Mr. Kelley. Not under probable cause where he has not
gone down there. The hypothetical we gave was one where he had

not taken any overt acts in perpetration of this.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, if he hasn't taken any overt acts,
are you then in what you would call in imminent threat of
human life or property?

Mr. Kelley. I think so.

Mr. Schwarz. How so? Unless he has taken an overt: act:
to buy the poison or to get in the car with the poison, there
is not by definition any threat to life or property.

Mr. Kelley. Mr. Schwarz, I've-been around in this business.
a long time. I've-heard a number of threats which were issued,
and they thereafter materialized into actions. I don't think -7
take these threats as being empty ones, because so many times
they have been acted upon.

I was criticized one time when there was a threat made to
kill me, and it was said later on, it's not rhetoric, it's

not rhetoric to me, because when they say they're going to

kill me, that just means one thing.

Mr. Schwarz. But I'm not disagreeing with you.

Mr. Kelley. But you are disagreéing with me. You're saying
on the basis of experience that you cannot detect a possible
threat. That's the whole area of concern that we have here, wh
we don't lose the capability of doing something. We don't
say we should initiate ourselves. We say that we should go to
the Attorney General. We do not subscribe to the idea that
we should act independently because maybe we don't have the
judicial review, the capability of determining, but we do
think that we should report it and thereafter see what can
be done.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, have you changed in the course of
our discussion the standard on page 5.

On page 5 you're talking about an imminent threat.

Mr. Kelley. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And I hear you now as saying a possible
threat.

Mr. Kelley. An imminent possible threat.

Mr. Schwarz. An imminent possible threat. All right.

Now, would a fair standard for either action, other than
arrest, I don't know what you have in mind, but something to
prevent the person from carrying out his activities, other
than arrest, for instance, what is an example of what you have

in mind?

WARD & PAUL

13 Mr. Kelley. I think that this thing could be worked out
14 so that there could be an adequate basis for an evaluation.
15 Mr. Schwarz. So those words, without trying to commit

16 you entirely to them, do not seem to you to depart far from

17 what you think would be an acceptable standard.
18 Mr. Kelley. Well, an imminent, immediate threat might

19 be, by virtue of the word "immediate" that he's going to

Mr. Schwarz. But on the question, let's take the opening
of an investigation into a domestic group.

Is it basically consistent with practicality to make the
test immediate threat of a serious Federal crime involving
violence?

Mr.KeIley. To open a domestic security case.

Mr. Schwarz. Yes.

Mr. Kelley. It appears to me that this is a terrorist
activity, in effect. We certainly have terrorist activities
under our jurisdiction as a threat against the United States.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, are there other circumstances where
it is justifiable to open an investigation of the domestic
group where you do not have an immediate threat of serious
federal crime involving violence?

Mr. Kelley. Oh, I think there are other criteria, and
they have been well defined as to what is the possible
opening, the basis for a possible opening. We haven't been
discussing that, we have been discussing particular instances,
but there are other criteria that are used, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. What would the other criteria be?

Mr. Kelley. Well, the possible statutory violations
over which we have jurisdiction are, generally speaking, the
most used of thebasis, and then you have, of course, some

intelligence investigations which should, of course, be of

short duration. If there is no showing of this into action

or a viable intent.

Mr. Schwarz. So that's what you're leaking for in the
intelligence investigation?

Mr. Kelley. . By intelligence investigation, yes, you
are looking to prevent.

Mr. Schwarz. And what you are looking EN and
what you're looking to find is a likelihood of action combined
with an intent to take an issue?

Mr. Kelley. And the capability.

Mr. Schwarz. And the capability.

All right. I just have two other lines, Mr. Kelley, and
I appreciate very much your time.

Mr. Kelley. That's all right.

Mr. Schwarz. Assuming a legitimate investigation has
been started into a domestic intelligence matter, is it legiti-
mate for the FBI, in addition to obtaining information that
relates to what we've just been talking about, the likelihood
of violent action, is it also legitimate for the FBI to
collect, A, retain, B, disseminate, C, information concerning
let's say the sex life of a person on the one hand, and the
political views of a person on the other?

Mr. Kelley. I think, Mr. Schwarz, that this is just what
many of our problems and perhaps the guidelines can define
this type of thing. I think probably you will agree that

within the determination of the deviations possibly of sex

3 2 ordinarily it's not. And so far as political views, yes, I
5
3 3 think that this could be, if he is espousing some cause or

4 some view that advocates violence or the overthrow of the

5 government.

6 Mr. Schwarz. Would those be the two limits on political
7 views?

8 Mr. Kelley. What?

9 Mr. Schwarz. Would those be the only limits on political
10 || views that you think are okay to collect, advocants of violence
11 || or advocants of overthrow?

12 Mr. Kelley. Well, I don't think because he's a Democrat

13 || ox a Republican it would be anything that would be damaging,

WARD & PAUL

14 but it might on the other hand counter the report that he's

15 |) @ member of some other organization.

16 Mr. Schwarz. Is the standard you used on collection of
17 || sex life information, might be relevant? I suppose anything
1g | might be relevant, but don't you think that as a function of

20 || justifiable to collect that kind of information on American

22 Mr. Kelley. Insofar as doing it presently, it has been

as a determination by guidelines that might be prepared later,
I think that we can certainly deliberate on this to see whether
or not this is something we should retain, and we would not
object to anything reasonable in that regard.

Mr. Schwarz. I just have one final question.

Taking the current manual and trying to understand its
applicability laid against the facts in the Martin Luther King
case, under Section 87 there is a -- permission is granted to
open investigations of the infiltration of non-subversive
groups, and the first sentence reads: "When information is
received indicating that a subversive group is seeking to
systematically infiltrate and control a non-subversive group
or organization, an investigation can be opened.” :

Now, I take it that is the same standard that was used
in opening the investigation of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in the 1960s, so that invéstigation could still be
open today under the FBI manual, the current FBI manual.

Mr. Kelley. We are interested in the infiltration of
clearly subversive groups into non-subversive groups inasmuch
as this is a ploy that is used many times, and having infil-
trated, they then get control, and they have a self-laundered
organization which they can use, and not, certainly, to the
benefit of the country.

Mr. Schwarz. But is the answer to my question yes, that

under that standard, the SCLC investigation could still be

Py 2 Mr. Kelley. I think so.
<
3 3 Mr. Schwarz. All right, then, just one final question.
4 Do you agree that special care needs to be taken not only

5 of the standards for initially opening an investigation of a
6 group, but perhaps extra care needs to be taken when the investil-
U7] gation goes beyond the initial target group to individuals
8 || or people who come into contact with it?

9 Mr. Kelley. I don't know if I agree with that entirely. If
10 || you mean that we go into the non-subversive group, that we
11 || then investigate peopie in that non-subversive group, not the

12g |) infiltrators, but the non, that we conduct a lengthy aa

19 I think that the questions of the Chief Counsel. was

6 Mr. Kelley. My personal opinion is that the Bureau does
7 a splendid job in this area. I feel further that the backgroun

9 all counterintelligence people have is very helpful. Tt is help-

law enforcement? ‘ oe
Mr. Kelley. There is always a problem when there is wide

dissemination, because that just numerically increases _the

possibility of misuse, abuse or slander, libel, or anything

of that matter, and I think that it would be well worthwhile

to review the dissemination rules to make them subject to

close guidance in the guidelines that we're speaking of.

Mr. Smothers. Let me just raise one final area with you.

We talked a little bit about, or a question was raised about

the investigation now being conducted by the Justice Department
regarding the improper actions on the COINTELPRO, and the
King case in particular.

- we look at allegations of impropriety by your personnel
I think it would be helpful for our record here to have some
insight into the procedure the Bureau would normally follow.

What does the Bureau do when you get an allegation that
an agent or administrative official in the Bureau has behaved
improperly?

Is an investigation conducted internally, or is it
routinely referred to the Justice Department?

Mr. Kelley. There may be a revision in this type of
procedure as a result of the establishment of the Council for
Professional Responsibility. At present it would be in the
great majority of the cases turned over to our Investigative

Division for investigation. There might, on some unusual

occasion, be a designation of a special task force made up,
perhaps, of division heads. That is most ie eee but it is
handled internally at present.

Mr. Smothers. Would these internal determinations be
reviewed by Justice, or do you think that is a necessary
step?

I guess what we are searching for here is, first of all,
I think you answered that, well, to what extent does the
Bureau police itself, and then secondly, is the Department of
Justice involved in the police determinations?

For instance, what if the Attorney General disagreed with
the assertion that only the higher up officials who ordered
the action against King should be the subject of investigation
and maybe prosecution?

How does the interplay work there between you and Justice?

Mr. Kelley. We do report to the Attorney General those
activities which we construe as improper or possibly. illegal.
There is a possibility that the Department, having been advised
of the situation, might take it on their own to do their own
investigating, and this is something that we feel is a
decision to be made only rather rarely, because we feel we
have within our own organization sufficient capability to
handle that. But we do not protest it. It is handled
independently of us.

Mr. Smothers. Thank you.

‘Senator Tower. What criteria do you ee in the selection
of informants?

Mr. Wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. In
our cases relating to extremist matters, surely in, order to get
an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged in a
criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set
of criteria. If you're talking about our internal security
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist

1
principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating
in the same ‘area, and in various established sources such as
local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type
who has eredibility, can be depended’ upon to be reliable, we
would interview the individual in order to maké a determination
ag to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI
in discharging its responsibilities in. that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we
would conduct a rather in depth investigation for the purpose
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator Tower. .How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between
the. use of informants for law enforcement as opposed to

intelligence collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?

engage in criminal activity, and the courts have held that,
especially the Supreme Court ‘in the Newark County Case, that
the very difficulty of penetrating an ongoing operation, that

an informant himself can engage in criminal activity, but

because there is lacking this criminal intent to violate a
law, we stay Beet: from that. Our regulations fall short of that.
If we have a situation where we felt that an informant

has to become involved in some activity in order to protect

or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United ~
Settee Attorney or to the Attorney General to or to make sure
we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our
iigormants.

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do
instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that
they are informing on, do you not?

Mr. Adams. We did when we had the COINTELPRO programs,
which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably
one of the best examples of a situation where’ the'law was
in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used
much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little
Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending
‘in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law
enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the
troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

to preserve the respective roles in law enforcement. You have
historical problems with the Klan coming along. We had
situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost
powerless to act. We had local law enforcement officers in
some areas participating in Klan violence.

The instances mentioned by Mr. Rowe, every one of those,
he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't
see what action was taken with that information, as he pointed
out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance. We
also knew that in certain instances the information, upon being
received, was not being acted upon. We also disseminated
simultaneously through letterhead Ser anes to the Department
of Justice the problem, and here, here we were, the FBI, in a
position where we had no authority in the absence of instructio:
from the Department of Justice, to make an arrest.

Sections 241 and 242 don't cover it because you don't have
evidence of a conspiracy, and it ultimately resulted in
a situation where the Department called in United States
Marshals who do have authority similar to local law enforcement
officials.

So, historically, in those days, we were just as frus~
trated as anyone else was, and when we got information from
someone like Mr. Rowe, good information, reliable information,

and it was passed on to those who had the responsibility to

do something about it, it was’ not always acted upon, as he
indicated. :

Senator Tower. None of these cases, then, there was
adequate evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to
act?

Mr. Adams. The Departmental rules at that time, and still

no violation.

Congress recognized this, and it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the civil rights
statute, which added punitive measures against an ‘individual
that didn't have to be a conspiracy. But this was a problem
ghat the whole country was grappling with: the President of
the United States, Attorney General. We were ina situation
where we had rank lawlessness taking place, as you know from
a memorandum we sent you that we sent to the Attorney General.

violence, and in neutralizing the Klan ~- and that was one

Veterans Against the War?

Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the
intent to halter political expression?

Mr. Adams. We had information on the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War that indicated that there were subversive
groups involved. They were going to North Vietnam and meeting
with the Communist forces. They were going to Paris, attending
meetings paid for and sponsored by the Communist Party, the
International Communist Party. We feel that we-had a very valid
basis to direct our attention to the VVAW.

It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was
head of the Communist Party, USA, and the comments he made,

and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it
split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost
group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point
factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and they clesed
those chapters because there was no longér any intent to follow
the national organization.

But we had a valid basis for investigating it, and we
investigated chapters to determine if there was affiliation
and subservience to the national office.

Senator Tower. Mr. Hart?
Senator Hart of Michigan. But in the process of chasing

after the Veterans Against the War, you got a lot of information,

statute.

Mr. Adams. JI agree, Senator.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Why don't you try to shut that
stuff off by simply telling the agent, or your informant?

Mr. Adams. Here is the problem that you have with that.
When you're looking at an organization, do you report only the
violent statements made by the group or do you also show that
you may have one or two violent individuals, but you have
some of these church ‘groups that were mentioned, and others,
that the whole intent of the group is not in violation of the
statutes, You have to report the good, the favorable along
with the unfavorable, and this is a problem. We wind up with
information in our files, We are accused of being vacuum
cleaners, and you are a vacuum cleaner. If you want to know the
real purpose of an organization, do you only report the
violent statements made and the fact that it is by,a small
minority, or do you also-show the broad base of the ean
and what it -really is?

And within that is where we have to have the guidelines
we have talked about before. We have to narrow down, because
we recognize that we do wind up with too much information in
our files.

Senator Hart of Michigan. But in that vacuuming process,
you are feeding into Depaxtmental files the names of people

who are, who have been engaged in basic First Amendment

exercises, and this is what hangs some of us up.

Mr. Adams. It hangs me up. But in the same files I
imagine every one of you has been interviewed by the FBI, eithe
asking you about the qualifications of some other Senator
being considered for a Presidential appointment, being inter-
viewed concerning some friend:who is applying for a job.

Were you embarrassed to have that in the files of the
FBI? 7

Now, someone can say, as reported at our last session, that
this is an indication, the mere fact that we have a pean in our
files has an onerous impression, a chilling effect. I agree.
It can have, if someone wants to distort what we have in our
files, but if they recognize that we interviewed you because
of considering: a man for the Supreme Court of the United
States, and that isn't distorted or improperly used, I don't
see. where any harm is served by having that in our files.

Senator Hart of Michigan. his is what should require
us to rethink this whole business. ;
Mr. Adams. Absolutely.
And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well
as the Congressional input oes going to address themselves to;
Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked about a wide ange
of groups which the Bureau can and has had informant penetration
and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's ‘definition
of when, an extremist or security investigation-may be under-
a refers to groups whose activity either involves violation
of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation
of such law, and when such an investigation is opened, then

informants may be used.

Another guideline says that domestic intelligence
investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations.
ong agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation
relevant to a potential violation. Even now, with an improved,
upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back
again in a world of possible violations or activities which
may result in illegal acts.

Now, any constitutionally protected exercise of the
right to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest, to petition,
conceivably may result in violonce or disruption of a lecal
town meeting, when a controversial social issue might result

in disruption. It might be by hecklers rather than those holdin

the meeting.

Does this mean that the Bureau should investigate all

* groups organizing or participating in such a meeting because

they may result in violence, disruption?

Mr. Adams. No, sir.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Isn't that how you justify
spying on almost every aspect of the peace movement?

Mr. Adams. No, sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we
monitor demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have an
investigative interest in, a valid investigative interest in,
or where members of one of these groups are participating where
there is a potential that they might change the peaceful
nature of the demonstration.

But this is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing on the
First amendment rights of people, yet at the same time being
aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers in the
past than we do at the present time, But we have had periods
where the demonstrations have been rather severe, ond the
courts have said that the FBI has ‘a right, and indeed a duty,

to keep itself informed with respect to the possible commission

of crime. It is not obliged to wear blinders until it may be

too late for prevention.

And that's a good statement if applied in a clearcut

Senator Hart of Michigan. Let's assume that the rule

for opening an investigation on a group is narrowly drawn. The

" Bureau manual states that ‘informants investigating a subversive

organization should not only report on what that group is
doing but should look at and report on activities in which
the group is participating.

There is a Section 87B3 dealing with reporting on
connections with other groups. That section says that the
field office-shall "determine and report on any, significant
connection or cooperation with non-subversive groups." ‘Any
significant connection or cooperation with flon-cubversive
groups.

Now let's look at this in practice. In the spring of
1969 there was a rather heated national debate over the
installation of the anti-ballistic missile system. Some of us
remember that. An FBI informant and two FBI confidential
soit eee reported on the plan's participants and activities
of the Washington Area Citizens ‘Coalition Against the ABM,
particularly in open public debate in’a high school auditorium,
which included speakers from the Defense Department for the
ABM and a scientist and defense analyst against the ABM.

The informants reported on the planning for the meeting,
the distribution of Perey to churches and schools,

participation by local clergy, plans to seek resolution on +

ABM from nearby town councils. There was also informa” au

plans for a subsequent town meeting in Washington with the
names of local political leaders who would attend.

Now the information, the informant information came as

participating in that coalition. Yet the information dealt
with all aspects and all participants. ‘The reports on the

plans for the meeting and on the meeting itself were disseminat

to the State Departnent, to military intelligence, and to the
White House.

How do we get into all of that?

Mr. Adams. Well --

Senator Hart of Michigan. Or if you were to rerun it,

Mr. Adams. Well, not in 1975, compared to what 1969
was. The problem we had at the time was where we had an
informant who had reported that this group, this meeting was
going to take place and it was going to bethe Daily World,
which was the east coast communist newspaper that made conments
about it. They formed an‘organizational meeting. We took

a quick look at it. The case apparently was opened in May .28,

1969 and closed June 5 saying there was no problem with this

organization.

fhis one is the fall of last year, 1975. President
Ford announced his new program with respect to amnesty, as
he described it, for draft resistors. Following that there .
were several national coneerenees involving all the groups
and individuals interested in unconditional amnesty.

Now RNG NAHI while unconditional amnesty is
not against -- while unconditional amnesty is not yet the law,

plans for the meeting and apparently attended and reported on

' the conference. The Bureau's own reports described the

participants oot having xepresented diverse perspectives on
the issue of amnesty, including civil liberties and human
rights groups, G.I. rights spokesmen, parents of men killed
in Vietnam, wives of ex-patriates in Canada, experts on draft
counselling, religious groups interested in peace issues,
delegates from student organizations, and aides of House and
| Senate members, drafting legislation on amnesty.

fhe informant apparently was attending in his role as
a member of a group under investigation as allegedly subversive
and it described the topics of the workshop.

Ironically, the Bureau office report before them noted
that in view of the location of the conference at a theological
seminary, the FBI would use restraint and limit its coverage
to informant reports.

Now this isn't five or ten years ago. This is last
fall. And this is’a conference of people who have the point
of view that I share, that the socner we have unconditional
amnesty, the better for the soul of the country.

Now what reason is it for a vacuum cleaner approach on
a thing like that? Don't these instances illustrate how broed
informant intelligence really is, that would cause these groups
in that setting having contact with other groups, all and

everybody is drawn into the vacuum and many names go into the

Is this what we want?

Mr. Adams. I'll let Mr. Wannall address himself to this.
Ne is particular knowledgeable as to this operation.

Mr. Wannall., Senator Hart, that was a case that was
opened on November 14 and closed November 20, and the informatiqn
which caused us to be interested in it were really. two particular
items. One was that a member of the steering committee there
was a three man steering committee, and oné of those members

of the national conference was in fact a national officer

of the VVAW in whom we had suggested before we did have a
legitimate investigative interest.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I would almost say so whht
at that point.

Mr. Wannall., The second report we had was that the
VVAW would actively participate in an attempt to pack the
conference to take it over. And the third report we had --

Senator Hart of Michigan. And incidentally, all of the
information that your Buffalo informant had given you with
respect to the goals and aims of the VVAW gave you a list of
goals which were completely within Constitutionally protecte3

objectives. There wasn't a single item out of that VVAW that

jeopardizes the security of this country at all.
Mr. Wannall. Well, of course, we did not rely entirely

on the Buffalo informant, but even there we did reces":

from that informant information which I considered to be
significant. :

The Buffalo chapter of the VVAW was the regional office
covering New York and northern New Jersey. It was one of the
five most active VVAW chapters in the country and at a
national conference, or at the regional conference, this
informant reported information back to us that an attendee :
at the conference announced that he had run guns into Cuba
prior to the Castro take-over. He.himself said that he during
the Cuban crisis had been under 24 hour suveillance. There
was also discussion at the qoneerenen of subjugating the
VVAW to the revolutionary union. There were some individuals
in the chapter or the regional conference who were not in
agreement with us, but Mr. Adams has addressed himself to the
interest of the revolutionary union.

So all of the information that we had on the vvaAW dia
not come from that source but even that particular source dié
give us information which we considered to be of some
significance in our appraisal of the need for continuing the
investigation of that particular chapter of the VVAW.

Senator liart of Michigan. But does it give you the
right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even
if it is a conference that might be taken over by the VVAW
when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we

seek to achieve unconditional’ amnesty? What threat?

Mr. Wannall. Our interest, of course, was the VVAV
influence on a particular eoeing if you ever happened to be
holding a meeting, or whatever subject it was.

Senator Nart of Michigan, What if it was a meeting to
seek to make more effective the food stamp system in this
country?

Nr. Wannall. Well, of course there had been some —
organizations. i

Senator Hart of Michigan. Would the same logic follow?

Mr. Wannall, I think that if we found that if the
Communist Party USA was going ‘to take over the meeting and
use it as a front for its own purposes, there would be a logic
in doing that. You have a whole scope here and it's a matter
of where you, do and where you don’t, and hopefully, as we've
said before, we will have some guidance, not only from this
committee but from the guidelines that are being developed.
But within the rationale of what we're doing today, I was
explaining to you our interest not in going to this thing and
not gathering everything there was about it.

In fact, only one individual attended and reported to us,
and that was the person who had, who was not developed for
this reason; an informant who had been reporting on other

matters for some period of time. 5

And as soon as we got the report of the oute.-.

discontinued any further interest.

Senator Hart of Michigan, Well, my time has expired
but even this brief exchange, I think, indicates that if we
really want to control the dangers to our society of using
informants to gather domestic political intelligence, we have
to restrict sharply domestic intelligence investigations. And
that gets us into what I would like to raise with you when
my turn comes around again, and that's the use of warrants,
obliging the Bie cae to obtain a warrant before’a full-fledged
informant can be directed by the Bureau against a group or
individuals.

I know you have objections to that and I would like to
review that: with you.

Senator Mondale, pursue that question.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an
obligation to obtain a warrant before you turn floose a fuli-
fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run
into you or you run into, or who walk in as information sources
The Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the
Committee. The Bureau argues that such a warrant requirement
might be unconstitutional because it would violate the First
Amendment rights of FBI informants to communicate with their
government. ,

Now that's a concern for First Amendmént rights that

ought to - hearten all the civil libertarians.

But why would that vary, why would a warrant require
raise a serious ‘constitutional question?

Mr. Adams, Well, for one thing it's the practicability
of it or the impacticability of‘getting a warrant which.
ordinarily involves probable cause to show that a crime has
been or is about to be committed.

tn the intelligence field we are oe dealing necessarily
with an imminent criminal, action, We're dealing with activitied
such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have
discussed before, where they say publicly we're ‘not to engace
‘in any violent activity today, put we guarantee you we still
subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time
is ripe, we're going i rise up and help overthrow the United
States.

Well, now, you can't show probable cause if they're about
to do it because they're telling you they're il going to do it
and you know they're not going to do it at this particular
moment.

It's just the mixture somewhat of trying to mix ina
criminal procedure with an intelligence gathering function, and
we can't find any practical way of doing it. We have a particular

Organization. We may have an informant that not only belongs

to the Communist Party, but belongs to several other organization:

and as part of his function he may be sent out by the Communist

Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.

and don't worry about it. We're making no headway on it.

6 It's just from our standpoint the possibility of informants,
7 the Supreme Court has held ‘that informants per se do not

8 violate the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendments. They have

9 recognized the necessity that the government has to have

{

18 can prescribe some safeguards, some rules and some standards,

Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential

security informant and a security informant?

Mr. Wannall. I mentioned earlier, Senator Schweiker,
that in developing an informant we do a preliminary check on
him before talking with him and then we do a further in-depth
background check.

A potential security informant is someone who is under
consideration before he is approved by headquarters for use as

an informant. He is someone who is under current consideration.

problem today, we are an investigative, agency. We do not

have police powers like the United States marshalls do.

Evoligl 1795, I qrigeell or some period like that, marshalls have
had the authority that almost borders on what a sheriff, has.

We are the investigative agency of the Deparment of Justice
and during these times the Department of Justice had us maintai
the role of an investigative agency. We were to ‘report on :
activities to furnish the information to ‘the local police, ©
who had an obligation to.act. We furnished it to the be per aan
of Justice.

In those areas where the local police did not act, it
resulted finally in the Attorney General sending 500 United
States marshalls down to guarantee the safety of people who
were trying to march in protest of their eivil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at a
keime of civil righs versus federal rights, and yet there was
a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the country.
This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement agencies
.in itself at the time either because many of them did act
upon the information that was furnished to them. But we
have no authority to make an arrest on the spot because we
would not have had evidence that there was a-.conspiracy
available. We can do absolutely nothing in that regard.

In Little Rock, the decision was made, for instance, that

if any arrests need to be made, the Army should make them and

that they had all the information they needed to clamp down
on the conspiracy ana could arrest people at that point in time,
and yet no arrests were made.

Why, Mr. Wannall, was this true?

Mr. Wannall. Well, I can answer that based oniy onthe
material that I have reviewed, Senator Schweiker. It was not
a case handled in my division but I think I can answer your.
question.

There was, in fact, a representative of the Department

of Justice on the spot counselling and advising continuously

}} as that case progressed as to what point the. arrest should be

made and we ivere being guided by ‘those to our mentors, the
ones who are responsible for making decisions of that sort.
So I: think that Mr. Hardy's statement to the effect ate
there was someone in the Department there is perfectly true.

under your procedures?

Iwhen they should be made, and decisions with regard to
prosecutions are made either by the United States attorneys

someone in the commission of the crime as further proof,
rather than relying on. one informant and some circumstantial
evidence to prove the violation.

Senator Schweiker. Well,.in this a though, they

even had a dry run. - They could have arrested them on the

,

dry run. |

That's getting pretty close to conspiracy, it seems to
me. ‘ghey had a dry run and they could have arrested them on
the dry run. :
4 ta like to know why they didn't arrest them on the dry
xun, Who was this Department of Justice official who made
that decision?

Mr. Adams. Guy Goodwin was the Department official.

Senator Schweiker. Next I'd like to ask back in 1965,
during the height of the effort to destroy the Klan, as you
pie it a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released
figures that we had ‘something like 2,000 Hertel of some
kind or another infiltrating the’ Klan out of roughly 10,000
estimated membership.

I believe these are either FBI figures or estimates.
That would mean that one out of every five members of the Klan
at that point was an informant paid by the government.

Ana I believe the figure goes orc? indicate that 70

percent of the new members of the Kla: that year were FBI

informants.

Isn't this an awfully overwhelming quantity.of people
to put in an effort such as that? I'm not criticizing that
you shouldn't have informants in the Klan and know what's

going on for violence, but it seems to me that this is the

tail wagging the dog.

For example, today we supposedly have only 1594 totali
informants for both domestic informants and potential informant.
and that here we had 2,000 just in the Klan alone.

Mr. Adams. Well, this number 2,000 did include all
racial matters, informants at that particular time, and I
think the figures we tried to reconstruct as to the actual
number of Klan informants in relation to Klan members was aroun
6 percent, I think, after we had read some of the testimony.

Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan had a
group called the Action Group. This was the group that you |
yemember from Mr. Rowe's testimony, that he was left af-
ter ‘the meeting. He attended the open meetings and heard

i
all of the hurrahs and this type of thing from information,

but he never knew what was going on because each one had an

action group that went out and considered themselves in the
missionary field.

Theirs was the violence.

In order to penetrate those, it takes, you have to direct
as many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in

mind that I think the newspapers, the President and Congress an

everyone is concerned about the murder of the civil cights

workers, the Linio Kent sase, the Viola Liuzzo case, the
bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one
tremendous problem at that time.

Senator Schweiker. _ teeta tans that. |

Mr. Adams. Our only approach was through informants
and through the use of informants we solved these cases, the
ones that were solved. Some of the bombing cases we have
never solved, They are extremely difficult. °

These informants, as we told the Attorney General, and
as we told the President, that we had moved informants like
Mr, Rowe up to the top Jeadership. He was the bodyguard to the
head man. He was in a position where he could forewarn us
of violence, could help us on cases that had transpired, and
yet we knew and conceived that this could continue forever
uhless we can create enough disruption that tees members will

{ :
realize that if I go out and murder three civil rights workers,

| even though the sheriff and other law enforcement officers are

in on it, if that were the case and with some of them it was
the case, that I would be caught. And that's what we did and
that's why. violence stopped, was because the Klan was insecure
and just like you say, 20 percent, they thought 50 percent of
their members ultimately were Klan members and they didn't
dare engage in these acts ‘of violence because they knew they

couldn't control the conspiracy any longer.

Senator Schweiker. My time is expired. I just have
ene quick question.

Is it correct that in 1971 we're using around 6500
informers for black ghetto situations?

Mr. Adams. I'm not sure if that's the year. We did
‘have one year where we had a number like that which probably
had been around 6000; and that was the time when the cities
were being burned, Detroit, Washington, areas like this. We,

1
were given a mandate to know what the situation is, where is
violence going to break out, what- next?

They weren't informants like an individual penetrating

an organization, They were listening posts in the community

that would help tell us that we have a group here that's getting

abeiesed pas start another fire~fight or something.
iSenator Tower, At this point, there are three more

Senators remaining for questioning. If we can try to get

everything in in the first round, we will not have a second

round and I think we can -finish around 1:00, and we can go

eee

on and terminate the proceedings.

However, If anyone feels that they have another question

that they want to return to, we can come back here by 2:00.

Senator Mondale? .
Senator Mondale. Mr. Adams, it seems to me that the

record is now fairly clear that when the FBI operates in the

field of crime investigating, it may be the best professional

tools of law enforcement to protect people from subversive

or dangerous’ ideas, which I find strange and quite profoundly

at odds with the philosophy of American government.

I started in politics years ago and the first thing we
haa to do was to get the communists out of our parts and out.
of the union. We did a very fine job. As far as I know, and
I'm beginning to wonder, but as far as I know, we had no help
from the FBI or the CIA. We just rammed them out of the meeting
on the grounds that they weren't Democrats and they weren't
good union leaders when .we didn't want anything to do with them
And yet, we see time and time again that we're going to
protect the blacks from Martin Luther King because he's
dangerous, that we've going to protect veterans from whatever
it is, and we're going to protect the Council of Churches
from the veterans, and so on, and it just gets so gummy “ana
confused and ill-defined and dangerous, that don't you agree
with me that we have to control this, to restrain it, so that
precisely what is expected of the FBI is known by you, by the
public, and that you can justify your actions when we ask
you?

Mr. Adams. I agree with that, Senator, and I would like

to point out that when the Attorney General made his statement

Mr. Hoover subscribes to it, we foll~ed that policy for abou
7 + oF
ten years until the President of the ited States said that

we should investigate the Nazi Party.

I for one feel that we should investigate the Nazi Party.
i feel that our investigation of the Nazi Party resulted in
the fact that in World War II, as contrasted with World War I,
there wasn't one single incident of foreign directed sabotage
which took place in the United States,

Senator vondale. And under the criminal law you could
“have investigated these issues of sabotage.

Isn't sabotage a crime?

Mr. Adams. Sabotage is a crime.

Senator Mondale. could you have investigated that?

Mr. Adams, After it happened.

Senator Mondale. You see, every time we get! involved
in political ideas, you defend yourself on the basis of
crimes that could have been committed. It's very interesting.

In my opinion, you have to stand here if you're going to
continue what you're now doing and as I understand it, you
still insist that you aia the right thing with the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War, and investigating the Council of
Churches, and this can still go on: This can still-go on under
your interpretation of your present powers, what you try to
justify on the grounds of your law enforcement activities
in terms of criminal matters.

law again. You're trying to defend apples with oranges. That.'s
the law. You can do that. :

Mr. Adams. That's right, but how ao you find out which
of _ 20,000 Bund members might have been a saboteur. You
don't have probable cause to investigate anyone, but you can
direct an intelligence operation against the German-American
Bund, the same thing we did after Congress said --

Senator Mondale. Couldn't you get a warrant for that?

Why did you object to going to court for authority for that?.

Mr. Adams. Because we don't have probable cause to
go against an individual and the law doesn't provide for
probable cause to investigate an organization.

There were activities which did take place, like one time
they outlined the Communist Party --

Senator Mondale. What I don't understand is why it

that you could use in the kind of Bonn situation where under
court authority you can investigate where there is probable
cause or reasonable cause to suspect sabotage and the rest.
Wouldn't that make a lot more sense than, just making these
decisions on your own? :
Mr. Adams. We have expressed ccaplete concurrence in
that. We feel that we're going to gr s%seat to death in the : I-

in this area. But I won't " agree with you, Senator, that we
have bungled the intelligence operations in the United States.
I agree with you that we have made some mistakes. Mr. Kelley
has set a pattern of being as forthright as any Director of the
FBI in acknowledging mistakes that. had been made, but I think
that as you said, and I believe Senator Tower said, and
Senator Church, that we have to watch those hearings because
of the necessity that we must concentrate on these areas of
abuse. We must not lose sight of the

dveralt law enforcement and intelligence community, and Ir
still feel that this is the freest councry in the world.

I've travelled much, as I'm sure you have, and I know we have
made some mistakes, but I feel that the people in the United
States are less chilled by the mistakes we have made than they
are by the fact that there are 20,000 murders a year in the

“Senator Mondale. That's correct, and isn't that an

after those who commit crimes rather than strengthening ox
continuing a policy which we now see undermines the public
confidence you need to do your job.

Mr, Adams. Absolutely. The mistakes we have made are
what have brought on this embarrassment to us. a

mistakes and in doing so this is what has hurt the FBI. But
at the same time I don't feel that a balanced picture comes
out, as you have said yourselves, because of the necessity
of zercing in on abuses.

I think that we have done one tremendous job. I think
the clecatadennenes “in the Klan was the finest hour of the

FBI and yet, I'm.sure in dealing with the Klan that we made

.some mistakes. But I just don't agree with bungling.

Senator Mondale. I don't want to argue over terms, but
I think I sense an agreement that ‘the FBI has gotten into troubl
over it in the political idea trouble, and that that's where we
need to have new legal standards.

Mr. Adams. Yes, Z agree with that.

Senator Tower. Senator Huddleston.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr, -Chairman.

Mr, Adams, these two instances we have studied at- some

length seems to have been an inclination on the part of

the Bureau to establish. a notion about an individual or a group

which seems to be very hard to ever change or dislodge. In

the case of Dr. King, where the supposition was that he was

being influenced by Coimmunist individuals, extensive investi-

gation was made, surveillance, reports came back indicating tha

this in fact was untrue, and directions continued to go out

to intensify the investigation. There never seemed to be a

willingness on the part of the Bureau to accept its own facts.
Ms. Cook testified this morning that something similar

to that happened with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, tha’

every piece of information that she supplied to the Bureau

seemed to indicate that the Bureau was not correct in its

assumption that this organization planned to commit violence,

or that it was being manipulated, and yet you seemed to insist

that this investigation go on, and. t:..s information was used

against the individuals.

Now, are there instances where the Bureau has admitted tha

its first assumptions were wrong and they have changed their

|, course?

Mr. Adams. We have admitted that. We have also shown

from one of the cases that Senator Hart brought up, that after

five days we closed the case. We were told something by an |

individual that there was a concern of an adverse influence
‘ a

in it, and we looked into it. On the Martin Luther King

situation there was no testimony to the effect that we just

' :
dragged on and on, or admitted that we dragged on and on and

on, ‘ad infinitum. The wiretaps on Martin Luther King were
all approved’ by the Attorney General. Microphones on Martin
Luther King were approved by another Attorney General. This

wasn't the FBI, and the reason they were approved was that |

there was a basis to continue the investigation up to a point,

Dr. King, but it's just like -- eH

Senator Huddleston. The Committee has before it memorandal
written by high officials of the Bureau indicating that the
information they were receiving from the field, from these

surveillance methods, did not confirm what their supposition

was.

was on another individual that I thi. somehow got mixed up

prove they aren't a Communist before we will agree not to
investigate them.

But the young lady.appearing this morning making the
comment that she never knew of anything she told us that
she considers herself a true member of the VVAW-WSO inasmuch
as she feels in general agreement of the principles of it, and
agreed to cooperate with the FBI in providing information regard-
ing the organization to aid in preventing violent individuals
from associating themselves with the VVAW-WSO. She is most
concerned about efforts.by the Revolutionary Union to take over
the VVAW-WSO, and she is working actively to prevent this..

I think-that we have a basis for investigating the VVAW-
WSO in certain areas today. In other areas we have stopped
the investigation. They don't agree with ‘these principles

revent crime, and you can't wait unt:1 something happens. The

Mr. Adams. We disseminated every single item which he,

Senator Huddleston. Now, the Committee has received
documents which indicated that in one situation the FBI assiste
an informant who had been established in a white hate group
to establish a rival white hate group, and that the Bureau paid
his expenses in setting up this rival organization. :

Now, does this not put the Bureau in a position of ‘peind
responsible for what actions the rival white hate group might
have undertaken? -

Mr. Adams. ta like to see if one of the other gentlemen
knows that specific case, because I don't think we set up a
specific group.

This is. Joe Deegan.

Mx. Deegan. Senatcr, it's my understanding that the
informant we're talking about decided to break off from the
group he was with. He was with the Macon Klan group of |
the United Klans of America, and he decided to break off. This
was in compliance with our regulations. His breaking off,
we lia not pay him to set up the organization. He did it
on his own. .We paid him for the information he furnished
us concerning the operation. We did not sponsor the “organiza-
tion.

Senator Huddleston. Concerning the new organization that
he set up, he continued to advise you of the activities of that
organization? a

Mr. Deegan. He continued to advi-: us of that organizatio

control you exercised over this kind of informant in this kind
of an organization and to. what ‘extent an effort is made to
prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing
that you are supposedly trying to prevent.

Mr. Adams. A good example of this was Mr. Rowe, who becamg
active in an action group, and we told him to get-out or
we would no longer use him as an informant, in spite of the
information he had furnished in the past.

We have had cases, Senator, where we have had --

Senator Huddleston, But you also told him to participate
in violent activities.

Mr. Adams. We did not tell him to participate in violent
activities.

Senator Huddleston. That's what he said.

Mr. Adams. I know that's what he said, But. that's what
lawsuits are.all about, is that there. are. two sides to the
issue, and our agents. handling. this have advised.us, and I
believe have advised. your staff, that at no time did they
advise him to engage.in violence.

Senator.Huddleston. Just to do what was necessary to

get the information, I believe maybe might have been his
instructions.

Mr. Adams. I don't think they made any such statement
to him along that line, and we have informants, we have

informants who have gotten involved in’ the violation of the law

to the effect that -- and I was sitting in the back of the
room and I don't recall it exactly, but some of them were
beat with chains, and I didn't hear whether he said he beat
someone with a chain or not, but I rather doubt that he did
because it's one thing being present, and it's another thing
taking an active part in criminal actions.

Senator Huddleston. He was close enough to get his

throat cut.

How does the gathering of information --

Senator Tower, Senator Mathias is here, and I think that
we probably should recess a few minutes.

Could we have Senator Mathias' questions and then should
we convene this afternoon?

Senator Huddleston. I'm finished. I just had one more :
question.

Senator ‘Tower. Go ahead.
Senator Huddleston. I wanted to ask how the selection of
information about an individual's personal life,.social, sex
life and becoming involved in that sex life or social life
is a requirement for law enforcement or crime prevention.

Mr. Adams, Our agent handlers have advised us on Mr.
Rowe, that they gave him no such instruction, they had no
such knowledge concerning it, and I can'= see where it would

these instructions were given to, an agent or an informant?

Mr. Adams. To get involved in sexual activity? No, sir.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

“Senator Tower, Senator Mathias.

“Senator Mathias. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to come back very briefly to the Fourth
Amendment considerations in connection with the use of informants
and in posing these questions we're not thinking of the one
time volunteer who walks in to an FBI office and says I have
a story I want to tell you and that's the only time that you
may see him. I'm thinking of the kind of situations in which
there is a more extended relationship which could be of varying

degrees. It might be in one case that the same individual

will have some usefulness in a number of situations. But when

the FBI orders a regular agent to engage in a search, the first

|

test is a judicial warrant, and what I would like’ to explore
with you is the difference between a one time search which :
requires a warrant, and which you get when you make that
search, and a continuous BBR which uses an informant, or
the case of a continuous search which uses a regular undercover
agent, someone who is totally under your control, and is in a
slightly different category than an informant.

Mr. Adams. Well, we get, there. into the fact that the

Supreme Court has still held that the use of informants does

not invade any of these constitutionally protected areas, ,and

| if a person wants to tell an informant something that isn't

protected by the Supreme Court.

{ An actual search for legal evidence, that is a protected

item, but information and the use of informants have been
consistently held as not posing any constitutional problems.

Senator Mathias. I would agree, if you're talking about
the fellow who walks in off the street, as I said earlier,
but is it true that under existing proeeauree informants are
given background checks?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. And they are subject to a testing period

Mr. Adams. That's right, to verify ana make sure they
are providing to us reliable information.

Senator Mathias. And during the period that the relation-
ship continues, they are rather closely controlled by the
handling agents.

“Mr, Adams. That's true.

Senator Mathias. So in effect they can come in a very
practical way agents themselves to the FBI.-

Mr. Adams.. They can do nothing --

Senator Mathias. Certainly agents in the common law use
of the word.

Mr. Adams. That's right, they can do nothing, and we
instruct our agents that an informant can do nothing that the

agent himself cannot do, and if the agent can work himself into

Senator Mathias. But if a regular agent who is a member

areas resolved.

Senator Mathias. And you believe that the Department,
if we could come together, would support, would agree te that
kind of a warrant requirement if we could agree on the language7

Mr. Adams. If we can work out problems and the Attorney

General is personally interested in that also.

*" senator Mathias. Do you think that this agreement. might
extend to some of those other areas. that we talked about?
Mr. Adams, I think that that would be a much greater
difficulty in an area of domestic Fare eninees informant who
reports on many different operations and different types of

activities that might come up rather than say in a Soviet

espionage or. a foreign espionage case where you do have a littl

more degree of specificity to deal with.

j Senator Mathias. I suggest that we arrange to get
together and try out some drafts with each other, but in the
meantime, of course, there's another alternative and that
would be the use of wiretap procedure by which the Attorney
General must approve a wiretap before it is placed, ‘and the
same general process could be used for informants, since

major abuses of Congress and get over this hurdle, I think

we're still going to have to recognize that heads of agencies
have to accept the responsibility for managing that agency
and we can't just keep pushing every operational problem up
to the top because there just aren't enough hours in the day.

Senator Mathias. But the reason that parallel suggests
itself is of course the fact that the wiretap deals generally
with one level of information in one Serce of gathering
information. You hear what you hear from the tap.

Mr. Adams. But you're dealing in a much smaller number
also.

Senator Mathias. Smaller number, but that's all .the
More reason. When an informant goes in, he has all of his
senses. He's gathering all of the information a human being
can acquire from a situation and has access to more information
than the eetege wiretap. at

, And it would seem to me that for that reason a.parallel
process might be useful ‘and in order.

Mr. Adams, Mr. Mintz pointed out one other main
distinction. to me which I had overlooked from our prior
discussions, which is the fact that with an informant he is
more in .the position of being a concentral monitor in that one
of the two parties to the conversation agrees, such as like

concentral monitoring of telephones and microphones and

anything else versus the wirctap itself.where the individual



(ae « " . "

1 whose telephone is being tapped is not aware and there is,

and neither of the two parties talking had agreed that their

3 conversation could be monitored.

4 Senator Mathias. I find that one difficult to accept.
5 If I'm the third party overhearing a conversation that is taking
6 place in a room where I am, and my true character isn't perceived
va by the two people who are talking, in effect they haven't i

deals with whether we shouldn't impose a standard of probable
cause that a crime has been committed as a means of controlling
the use of informants and the kind of information that they
collect.

Do you feel that this would be too restrictive?

Mr. Adams, Yes, sir, I do.

When I look at informants and I see that each year
informants provide _ locate 5000 dangerous fugitives, they
provide subjects in 2000 more cases, they Tecover $86 million
in stolen property and contraband, and that's irrespective
of what we give the lecal law enforcement and other Federal
agencies, which is almost a comparable figure, we have almost
reached a point in the criminal law where we don't have much
left. And in the intelligence field we still, I think when
we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure
that we have the means to gather information which will permit
us to be aware of the identity of individuals and organizations
that are acting to overthrow the government of the United
States. And I think we still have some areas to look hard
at as we have discussed, but I think informants are here to
stay. They are absolutely essential to law enforcement.
Everyone uses informants. The press has informants, Congress
has informants, you have individuals ‘in youl community that
you rely on, not for ulterior purposes, but to let you know

what's the feel of the people, am I serving them properly,

QUESTION: ++-.You do use informants and do instruct them to
spread dissention among certain groups that they are
informing on, do you not?

MR. ADAMS: We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were
discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably one
of the best examples of a situation where the law was
ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights
used much more than we hear today. We saw with the
Little Rock situation the President of the United States
sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use
local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement
use the troops only as a'last resort. When you have a
situation like this where you do try to preserve the
respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical
problems.

With the Klan coming along, we had situations where
the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless
to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some
areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents
mentioned by Mr. Rowe--everyone of those he saw them from the
lowest level--the informant. He didn't see what action
was taken with that information as he pointed out during
his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance.

We also know that in certain instances the infor-
mation upon being received was not being acted upon. We

also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead

memorandum to the Department of Justice the problem.

And here we were--the FBI--in a position where we had no
authority in the absence of an instruction from the
Department of Justice to make an arrest. Section 241
and 242 don't cover it because you don't have evidence
of a conspiracy. It ultimately resulted in a situation
where the Department called in U. S. Marshals who do have
authority similar to local law enforcement officials.

So historically, in those days, we were just as
frustrated as anyone else was, that when we got information
from someone like Mr. Rowe--good information, reliable
information--and it was passed on to those who had the
responsibility to do something about it, it was not always
acted upon as he indicated. :

QUESTION: In none of these cases, then, there was adequate
evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to act.

MR. ADAMS: The Departmental rules at that time, and still do,
require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.
Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together.
You can have a mob scene and you can have blacks and whites
belting each other, but unless you can show that those that
initiated the action acted in concert, in a conspiracy, you
have no violation.

Congress recognized this and it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the Civil

Rights Statute which added punitive measures against an

NW 55252 DociId:32989823 Page 185



individual. There didn't have to be a conspiracy. This
was a problem that the whole country was grappling with--
the President of the United States, Attorneys General--we
were in a situation where we had rank lawlessness taking
place. As you know from the memorandum we sent you that
we sent to the Attorney General the accomplishments we were
able to obtain in preventing violence and in neutralizing
the Klan and that was one of the reasons.

QUESTION: »..-A local town meeting on a controversial social
issue might result in disruption. It might be by hecklers
rather than by those holding the meeting. Does this
mean that the Bureau should investigate all groups
organizing or participating in such meetings because
they may result in violent government disruption?

MR ADAMS: No sir, and we don't....

QUESTION: Isn't that how you justify spying on almost every
aspect of the peace movement?

MR. ADAMS: No sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we monitor

demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have
an investigative interest in, a valid investigative
interest in, or where members of one of these groups are
participating where there is a potential that they might
change the peaceful nature of the demonstration.

This is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing

on the lst Amendment right, yet at the same time, being

pean Be

NW 55252 DoclId:32989823 Page 186



aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers
in the past than we do at the present time. We have had
periods where the demonstrations have been rather severe
and the courts have said that the FBI has the right,
and indeed the duty, to keep itself informed with respect
to the possible commission of crime. It is not obliged
to wear blinders until it may be too late for prevention.
Now that's a good statement if applied in a clear-cut
case.

Our problem is where we have a demonstration and
we have to make a judgment call as to whether it is one
that clearly fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor
the activities. That's where I think most of our disagree-
ments fall.

QUESTION: In the Rowe Case, in the Rowe testimony that we just
heard, what was the rationale again for not intervening when
violence was known about. I know we have asked this several
times--I'm still having trouble understanding what the
rationale, Mr. Wannall, was in not intervening in the Rowe
situation when violence was known.

MR. WANNALL: Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address himself to
that and if you have no objections, I'll ask that he be
the one to answer the question.

MR. ADAMS: The problem we had at the time, and it is the problem
today, we are an investigative agency; we do not have

police powers even like the U. S. Marshals do. The Marshals

NW 55252 DocId:32989823 Page 187



since about 1795 I guess, or some period like that, had
authorities that almost border on what a sheriff has. We
are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice,
and during these times the Department of Justice had us
maintain the role of an investigative agency.

We were to report on activities. We furnished the
information to the local police who had an obligation to
act. We furnished it to the Department of Justice in those
areas where the local police did not act. It resulted
finally in the Attorney General sending 500 U. S. Marshals
down to guarantee the safety of people who were trying to
march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at
a time of Civil Rights versus Federal Rights and yet there
was a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the
country. This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement
agencies in the South at the time either, because many of
them did act upon the information that was furnished to
them. But we have no authority to make an arrest on the
spot because we would not have had evidence that was a
conspiracy available. We could do absolutely nothing in
that regard. In Little Rock the decision was made, for
instance, that if any arrests need to be made, the Army
should make them. And next to the Army, the U. S. Marshals
should make them--not the FBI, even though we developed

the violations. We have over the years as you know at the

QUESTION:

MR ADAMS:

NW 55252 DocId:32989823 Page 189

-@ e

Time there were many questions raised. Why doesn't the
FBI stop this? Why don't you do something about it? Well,
we took the other route and effectively destroyed the Klan
as far as committing acts of violence and, of course, we
exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

What would be wrong, just following up on your point
there, Mr. Adams, with setting up a program since it is
obvious to me that a lot of our informers are going to
have preknowledge of violence of using U. S. Marshals on
some kind of long-range basis to prevent violence?

We do. We have them in Boston in connection with
the busing incident. We are investigating the violations
under the Civil Rights Act, but the Marshals are in
Boston. They are in Louisville, I believe, at the same
time and this is the approach that the Federal Government
finally recognized.

On an immediate and fairly contemporary basis that
kind of help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting
till it gets to a Boston state. I realize a departure from
the past and not saying it isn't, but it seems to me we need
a better remedy than we have.

Well, fortunately we are at a time where conditions have
subsided in the country even from the 60's and the 70's, or
50's and 60's. We report to the Department of Justice on
potential trouble spots around the country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be aware of them. The planning

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

NW 55252

for Boston, for instance, took place a year in advance, with
state officials, city officials, the Department of Justice

and the FBI sitting down together saying "How are we going to
protect the situation in Boston"? I think we have learned a
lot from the days back in the early 60's. But, the Government
had no mechanics which protected people at that time.

Next I would like to ask, back in 1965, I guess during
the height of the effort to destroy the Klans as you put it
a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released figures that
we had something like 2,000 informers of some kind or another
infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10,000 estimated member-
ship.

That's right.

I believe these are FBI figures or estimates. ‘ That would
mean that 1 out of every 5 members of the Klan at that point
was an informant paid by the Government and I believe the
figure goes on to indicate that 70 percent of the new members
in the Klan that year were FBI informants. Isn't that an
awful overwhelming quantity of people to put in an effort such
as that? I'm not criticizing that we shouldn't have informants
in the Klan and know what is going on to revert violence but it
just seems to me that the tail is sort of wagging the dog. For
example today we supposedly have only 1594 total informants,
both domestic informants and potential informants. Yet, here
we have 2,000 in just the Klan alone.

Well, this number of 2,000 did include all racial matters

and informants at that particular time and I think the figures

DocId:32989823 Page 190 -7-



; © e

we tried to reconstruct as to the actual number of Klan
informants in relaton to Klan members was around 6 percent, I
think after we had read some of the testimony on it. Isn't that
right, Bill? Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan
had a group called the Action Group. This was the group if you
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony that he was left out of in
the beginning. He attended the open meetings and heard all the
hoorahs and this type of information but he never knew what was
going on because each one had an Action Group that went out and
considered themselves in the missionary field. Theirs was the
violence. In order to penetrate those you have to direct as
many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in mind
that I think the newspapers, the President, Congress, everyone,
was concerned about the murder of the three civil rights
workers, the Lemul Penn case, the Violet Liuzzo case, the
bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one
tremendous problem at that time.

QUESTION: I acknowledge that.

MR. ADAMS: Our only approach was through informants. Through the
use of informants we solved these cases. The ones that were
solved. There were some of the bombing cases we never solved.
They're extremely difficult, but, these informants as we told
the Attorney General and as we told the President, we moved
informants like Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the
bodyguard to the head man. He was in a position where he

could see that this could continue forever unless we could

NW 55252 Docld:32989823 Page 191 -8-



create enough disruption that these members will realize that
if I go out and murder three civil rights, even though the
Sheriff and other law enforcement officers are in on it, if
that were the case, and in some of that was the case, that I
will be caught, and that's what we did, and that's why violence
stopped because the Klan was insecure and just Like you say

20 percent, they thought 50 percent of their members ultimately
were Klan members, and they didn't dare engage in these acts of
violence because they knew they couldn't control the conspiracy
any longer.

QUESTION: I just have one quick question. Is it correct that in
1971 we were using around 6500 informers for a black ghetto
situation?

MR ADAMS: I'm not sure if that's the year. We did have a year
where we had a number like that of around 6000 and that was
the time when the cities were being burned. Detroit, Washington,
areas like this, we were given a mandate to know what the
situation is, where is violence going to break out next. They
weren't informants like an individual that is penetrating an
organization. They were listening posts in the community that
would help tell us that we have another group here that is
getting ready to start another fire fight or something.

QUESTION: +... Without going into that subject further of course we
have had considerable evidence this morning where no attempt
was made to prevent crime when you had information that it

was going to occur. I am sure there were instances where

you have.

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We disseminated every single item which he reported to us.

To a police department which you knew was an accomplice to
the crime.

Not necessarily knew.

Your informant told you that, hadn't he?

The informant is on one level. We have other informants
and we have other information.

You were aware that he had worked with certain members of
the Birmingham Police in order...

That's right. He furnished many other instances also.

So you really weren't doing a whole lot to prevent that
incident by telling the people who were already a part of it.

We were doing everything we could lawfully do at the
time and finally the situation was corrected when the Department
agreeing that we had no further jurisdiction, sent the U.S.
Marshals down to perform certain law enforcement functions.

...This brings up the point as to what kind of control
you can exercise over this kind of informant and to this
kind of organization and to what extent an effort is made to
prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing
that you were supposedly trying to prevent.

A good example of this was Mr. Rowe who became active in
an Action Group and we told him to get out or we were no longer
using him as an informant in spite of the information he had
furnished in the past. We have cases, Senator where we have had

But you also told him to participate in violent activities

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We did not tell him to participate in violent activities.

That's what he said.

I know that's what he says, but that's what lawsuits
are all about is that there are two sides to issues and our
Agent handlers have advised us, and I believe have advised your
staff members, that at no time did they advise him to engage
in violence.

Just to do what was necessary to get the information.

I do not think they made any such statement to him
along that line either and we have informants who have gotten
involved in the violation of a law and we have immediately
converted their status from an informant to the subject and
have prosecuted I would say off hand, I can think of around
20 informants that we have prosecuted for violating the laws
once it came to our attention and even to show you our policy
of disseminating information on violence in this case during
the review of the matter the Agents have told me that they
found one case where an Agent had been working 24 hours a
day and he was a little late in disseminating the information
to the police department. No violence occurred but it showed
up in a file review and he was censured for his delay in
properly notifying local authorities. So we not only
have a policy, I feel that we do follow reasonable safeguards
in order to carry it out, including periodic review of all
informant files.

Mr. Rowe's statement is substantiated to some extent with

an acknowledgment by the Agent in Charge that if he were going

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

to be a Klansman and he happened to be with someone and they
decided to do something, he couldn't be an angel. These are
words of the Agent. And be a good informant. He wouldn't
take the lead but the implication is that he would have

to go along or would have to be involved if he was going

to maintain his liability as a ---

There is no question that an informant at times will
have to be present during demonstrations, riots, fistfights
that take place but I believe his statement was to the
effect that, and I was sitting in the back of the room and I do
not recall it exactly, but that some of them were beat with
chains and I did not hear whether he said he beat someone with
a chain or not but I rather doubt that he did, because it is
one thing being present, it is another thing taking -an
active part in a criminal action.

It's true. He was close enought to get his throat cut
apparently.

How does the collection of information about an
individual's personal life, social, sex life and becoming
involved in that sex life or social life is a requirement for
law enforcement or crime prevention.

Our Agent handlers have advised us on Mr. Rowe that
they gave him no such instruction, they had no such knowledge
concerning it and I can't see where it would be of any

value whatsoever.

were given to an Agent or an informant?

START AT THE BEGINNING AND TELL THEM’ALL ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITIES

SCHAFERS GOT THE DEFINITE IMPRESSION THAT EPSTEIN AND HIS CASUAL
AND UNPROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUES EXPECTED TO HEAR AN AFTERNOON OF
INTERESTING STORIES AND ANECDOTES. :

THE SCHAFERS ASKED EPSTEIN HOW HE GOT THEIR NAMES , AND
EPSTEIN SAID ORIGINALLY FROM JOHN CREWDSON'S "NEW YORK TIMES"
ARTICLE. JILL SCHAFER THEN SAID THAT CREWDSON HAD GOTTEN THEIR”
NAMES THROUGH AN INDISCRETION BY JOE BURTON IN TAMPA. CREWDSON
APPARENTLY BELIEVED THAT THE SCHAFERS WOULD HAVE BACKED UP
BURTON AND HIS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FBI. JILL TOLD EPSTEIN
THEY WOULD DEFINITELY NOT BACK BURTON'S ALLEGATIONS, AND WERE
NOT "MEDIA FREAKS," AS BURTON APPARENTLY WAS, AND THAT THEY DID
NOT WANT THEIR ACTIVITIES LEAKED TO THE PRESS, AS HAD BURTON.

Enclosed is one copy of a letter from MICHADL 7.
EPSTLIN dated 5/14/75.

On Monday, 5/19/75, tha captioned sources reccived
the enclosed letter.

UPSTLIN is not known to the sources. ‘They have in
the past recéived other written inquiries from individuals
whon the courecs believe were in fact newsrien fushing for
additional stories on the sources’ activitics.

: fhe sources have not yet contacted DPSTRIN, but are
willing to do co voluntarily if the Dureau sees no objection
and assuning EPSTLIN is who he represents hinself to be, and

if DPSTOIN can assure then of discretion in not revealing their
current address and location. They are anxious to do what thoy
ean ta speak well for the TBI and to sct the rocord straight
regarding past nows stories derogatory to themselves and to

FDI informant operations. ‘The sources presume the Church
Committee will explore areas of PRI informant infiltration

into legal defense carps, informant provocateurisn, and
informant oncration outside the United States and FBI
jurisdiction.
