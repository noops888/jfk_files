. OCTOBER 1950

Early in October 1950, DIMITROV visited the Lavrion Camp where he met
, with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been
given a "charter and instructions", by certain members of {sd
[| to form a committee of five mémbers:for the planning and execu-
tion of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according

to. DIMITROV, would be established in Athens and would cooperate with other

similar committees which have. already been formed in France, Germany, and

other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would
establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc". Recruits would come from
among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party

(Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. Eligible Bulgarian emigres

would come to Greece from Western Europe. to assist in the work and pr
. . : : > o-



minent members of the Gichev Agrarians and of the Democratic Party would

be assisted in escaping to Greece (presumably from Bulgaria) to join the
organization. ;
DIMITROV listed the organization's tasks as follows:
a. Intelligence activity in Bulgaria.
b. Organization of an underground resistance
movement in Bulgaria, and
’ c. Organization of sabotage activity against
Bulgaria.
DIMITROV revealed that he was the president of the organization.

DIMIRTOV took frequent occasion to mention that the

committee had its headquarters in [ where he has a
room assigned for his own use. He also stated that the commitee maintains

1 November 1950

DIMITROV again visited the Lavrion Camp to inform his recruitsthat they

_ would: short ly be moved to a pleasant hime in Athens which the Americans
‘were repainting for the purpose. On the occasion of this visit, the re-

“ cruits were divided into three groups, as follows:

a. a groupd of 10 men to specialize in intelligence;
b. a group of 6 men to be trained in radio in Germany
c. a group of.15 men to specialize in sabotage.

The source of hhe information contained in the | _]s1992 described

DIMITROV as"'an unprincipaled opportunist and Greek agent".

[ __|s1992, 14.12.50



During this period of time, DIMITROV was the principal agent ~

in an ill-fated operation which resulted in a major expose and
trial in Sofia during 1951. The agents used were those selec-
ted by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was g¢#6 probably an
operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer

of his colleagues.

1. General DIMITROV called the undersigned on 30 March to
say hello and request.a meeting. We met for dinner -at the Astoria
Restaurant at 8 p.m., 31 March, :

2. During the course of the evening, Dico said he had seen ~
my boss. When I asked whom he meant, he replied, Dick Helms. He
said he had known Helms for years and further that he had seen
him that. Thursday in order to find out his position on the new
organization the General was in which was holding its first rally:
the next evening in New York. (This organization has something
to do with rabid anti-commmism and support for the U.S. in the
Vietnam war.) The General said Helms’ position was one of go
ahead; he had no strong feelings supporting or condemning such
a group.

3. Dico made further loud comments about support for the
war. Our waitress overheard and mentioned that she was leaving
A the next morning for Saigon to entertain troops and to find out
! what the war was really about. Dico made a small scene about how
:, wonderful this was, etc.

‘' 4, The General is the most rabid anti-communist I Have ever .
met. For him there can be no compromise between them and the

. Free world; they must all be destroyed. After continuing on in
this vein for some time, he finally quit. Also, he stated at the
beginning of the evening that he did not drink and then proceeded
to have a combination of drinks fairly fast. He did not appear
drunk, but with each drink he got louder and louder. The other
dinexe paid little attention, however, due to music and other
covering noises.

A loose-knit groups of Agrarians to. Withstand Communist pressures.

Diko's organizational activities often lead him across the
Yugoslav frontier. Allegedly he worked in Vardar Macedonia in
order to organize Bulgarian sympathizers for the cause of Dr.
G. M. Dimitrov, and upon the advice of a certain General ...
Kitchharov.

In April and May 1945, Diko was in Sofia, in contact)with
Dr. G. M. Dimitrov, Nikola Petkov and Mara Raicheva. After Dike

From. October 13 to November 11, 1946,Diko was tried in
the Vratsa court for "having organized subversive groups: all
over Bulgaria." The chief prosecutor was a man named Chernev,
the presiding judge was a certain Pencho Spasov, Diko was
sentenced on four counts: to death, to 15 years, to 6 years and
to 3 years imprisonment. He was jailed and put in solitary
confinement.

On June 2, 1947, he was tried and sentenced to death by
the Sofia Military Court. Also, he states, he was tried and
sentenced to death by the court at Lom.

In June, 1947, Diko was taken to a quarry in Vratea where
he worked loading rock. On July & he escaped from the quarry
and went to Mesdra. In Mesdra he contacted the post which he
had established there, and received help in travelling further...
He went to-Zverova and then to Sofia, While in Sofia he asked
for and received some help both from the British and from the
Americans, He claims that on one occasion he slept in the Sofia
house of Jack Horner, of the American Legation. (At this. time
Mr. Horner was. living in his swamer home at Simeonove.) . Dike
claims alse to. have stayed with Michael Shipkov.

On July 23, 1947 he crossed the Greek frontier south of
Zlatograds He gave himself up the next day at Shahin.

British authorities in Sofia had notified the British in
Salonika, and they. made arrangements for Diko to be admitted
to the British hospital in Xanthi., After eighteen days in
the hospital there he was transferred to the British “Fospital
in Salonika. After a month and a half in Salonika he was sent™
to Athens. Greek authorities sent him to the refugee.camp at -
Lavrion. Dike spent nine months in Lavriag then went to Athens,
where he obtained employment broadcasting in Bulgarian om Radio
Athens. His subsequent activities in Greece are discussed in
section 2, below.

a very little English.

‘ Government. provides him with quarters in a run-down hotel in
New Phaleron and it pays him 2800 drachmae per day subsistence.
Fi (Generally, a.refugee is not entitled to subsistence money if
Ye he has any employment: whatosever.)

Dike also writes articles for various Athens newspapers
(see enclosure No. 6) and has received money for them... Other
literary activities are described. in section 2. b., below.

A-Mr. Humphries, technical adviser of the BBC at Radio”
Athens, allegedly has offered Diko a job with BBC in London.
Dike has refused to accept this offer to date, because of his
primary interest in organising refugees into a "Democratic
Bloc." Should he find it impossible to acquire funds necessary
for his continued activities in Gresce, however, he plans to
go to London with BBC, ae

bo Publications. Dike is a prolific auther and is at
present writing an eight part work on Bulgaria to be entitled
"Under the Whip of Stalin." The eight parts of the book are:

1) The Liberation of Bulgaria
In the Hands of the Militia
Justice and Communism

4). Prisons and Camps
Agrarians and Communisn
Workers and Communism

7) ‘Army and Communism

(8) Church and Communism

Dike has already written parts1,.5 and 7. Parts 1 and 5
have been published in Greece. They are enclosures No.1 and
No, 2 to this despatch. Part 7 (enclosure No. 3) is being pub-
lished by the Greek General Staff and is-at the printers at the
present time. Diko received about 3,000,000 drachmae for each
part of his book which has been published; he expects to earn
about the same amount for Part 7, and for subsequent parts.

Dike states that. he has written the books which have been
published "for the Greek audience.” He realizes that they will
not meet approval in the West, largely because they are too
emotional. Also, he has omitted from the Greek versions of
his bock certain anti-Monarchist sentiments which he did not -
express "for political reasons." Diko has re-written the first
two parts of his book "for the American audience" and is very

anxious to have. them published in the United States... Enclesures.
No. 4 and Now 5 are the Greek texts of these revised portions.

Diko refers to himself often as "the new Kravchenke = better
than Kravchenko." . The Peripheral Reporting Unit asked Mrs. Mary.
Johnston, former Press Attache at the United States Legation in
Sofia, to read the Greek text of Diko’s books and check on this
boast. (Diko’s books are available only in Greek at the present
time.) Mrs. Johnston stated that "Diko is certainly no worse
than Kravchenko."....Mrs. Johnston believes that Diko is an inte-
resting and graphie author and that -- if he could abstain from

frequent use of Balkan epithets -- his work might merit publica-: ©

tion in English. . Mrs. Johnston selected a short. from

almost entirely toward Bulgarian refugees im the camp at Lavrion.
Diko was made a member of the "P.-D. Petkov" organization which -
was formed in Lavrion on April 30, 1950. (See CAS report E~3295,
September 16, 1950.)°.He has taken over and expanded the acti-.
vities of this group, and now considers. himself. its leader.

Dike claims that he has twelve "hard core” meabers in his
group and fifty-four interested supporters. He claims that he =
will have ninety supporters as soon as he can find the funds te ©
print and distribute his program, and to provide ether conerete
proofs of his growing strength.

Dike appears tobe an excellent organizer, He keeps AR
up-to-date lists of all the Bulgarians in the camp at Lavrion.-
The Bulgarians are listed. according to Diko's estimate of their
political position. Thus there is a group called Supporters.
there is one called Potential Supporters, there is a group of
“hard core" Gemetoists, a list of Nationalists, ete. Diko 2
also files all of his ideas and correspondence and, in general,
seems to have a good idea of what he has done and is doing.

Diko makes it a point to visit the camp at Lavrion regu=-
larly, and to bring with him cigarettes and food which he dis-
tributes among new arrivals. Allegedly, he tells these new
arrivals that the presents are given to them because they are
Bulgarians, not as a bribe to join his political group. "In
actual fact, however," Dike admits, "this is a very successful
way of getting people to support us." Diko claims that he pays
for these little gifts himself; he emphatically denies having
received outside help in this matter.

as published.in Sofia in 1922. Diko carries an old and dog=
eared copy of this publication with him. Presumably a copy is
available in Washington.

In addition to these basic tenets, Diko’s group has evolved
a supplementary program... The points of this supplementary pro=
gram are listed on enclosure No. & In general, Diko’s program ap-
pears democratic and idealiatic.

Diko’s group is opposed unalterably to the Bulgarian National
Committee and to Dr. G. M. Dimitrov. Diko states that, although
he worked with Dr. Dimitrov for many years, he has come to realise
that Dr. Dimitrov. is guilty of those same totalitarian and ter-
rorist leftist practices of which the Communists are guilty.

Diko states that the final break with Dr. Dimitrov came over the
following. incident: 7

- Dr..G.M.' Dimitrov knew that Diko had orga-
nised many. secret posts throughout Bulgaria
and, after Diko escaped from Bulgaria, Dr.
Dimitrov asked Diko to name the posts. .
Diko thought it wise not to write dow-the -
names of the. persons in charge of the posts,
and was also suspicious of this request.

When Dr. Dimitrov did not receive the infor=-
mation he wanted, he became very angry and
"showed his true totalitarian hand.”

(Dike has made available to the Peripheral Reporting Unit
many of his files, including those on his correspondence with
Dr. Dimitrov. It appears that he does know GeMe and that GeMe
at one time thought well of Diko. --For-instance,~in-a letter
dated October 31,-1947, Dr. Dimitrov spoke of Dike as a "hero™ -
and in a letter dated -danuary 2, 1948, Dr. Dimitrov stated
that he had Spydixo some cli apg and shaving equipment.)

a. Memorial Services for Nikola Petkov. On Saturday,
September 23, 1950, Diko organized a memorial service. in Lavrion,
commemorating the third anniversary of the hanging of Nikola
Petkov. Diko stated that about eighty refugees came to.his
church service. (Pictures of the occasion, see enclosure Ho. 10,
indicate that. about sixty were present.) he majority of the
people in attendance were Bulgarians, but there were also a few
refugees of other nationalities, a Greek priest and pateiee
and a few tow officials.

The memorial service lasted for more than an hour and ine.
cluded a mass,’and.a speech by Dike. Diko claims that.his..~
speech was so moving that all of the refugees cried, ineluding
himself. Following the service, Diko laid a wreath at the ‘tom -
polaseeee monument. and the group repaired to a —— for -re= |

shmentso -

The cost of the memorial service, indicated below was ‘not
inconsiderable..“Diko states that he d about half of it hin-.

It is interesting to note. that. no Gemetoiats took part- in

correberated by a Gemetoist who visited the Embassy ear!

October to complain about the “high-handed audacity. of] in

pretending to speak for Democracy." (Hot The Peripheral, os

3. Comments
Dike is a pleasant, hard work: young man of average
intelligence. He shows a politician’s glibness which is El
ordinary in a man of his age. He can talk for hours about

As an example of Diko's awareness of the politician’s
role, it might be mentioned that he now wears a well cut suit
of the finest materials, a pair of excellent. imported shoes,-
be a silk shirt and a.silk tie. Diko is buying these on credit,
at 150,000 drachmae ($10) per month. He claims that a good
appearance is. necessary if he is to inspire the confidence and
cooperation of the refugees among whom he is working.

Dike isa rugged: individualist and it would seem that his
individualism is his greatest: enemy at. present.. He is intole-
rant and suspicious.of others, and is the type of person who
would prefer to lead his om small group to suicide than to
follow as:a private in a larger army whose aims were not exactly
his own.

There is a very great deal of the charlatan about Diko.
Mrs spoke with him on two occasions, and then discarded him-as
a “phony.” The Peripheral Reporting Unit believes, however,
that, notwithstanding bis superficiality and the exaggerations «
to which he is prone, Dike has such an intuitive grasp of the
rudiments of political deportment and showmanship, and he is
80 devoted to his self-appointed task of organising his "Demo-. ~
cratic Bloc,” that he might become an important Bulgarian figure.

"INCIDENT IN VULCHEDRAM®

Excerpt from Agrarians and Communism, by Dimiter Adamov Dimitrov

So one ‘day Yamkov ...(was)... told to go to the "Committee."
The invitation was made personally by Tinko so that it would
not have the meaning and character of an order.. (He was the
pevnenl ¥ a Communist who probably had an important post in the
capital. .

"We have missed you, Yamkov, we see nothing of you.”
"Oh, well, business. you know.”

"Why don't you come to the office of the People’s Comittee
So that we.can sit and have a talk?” :

"To the office? What would I be doing there?”
"Oh, having a talk." :
"What do we have to talk about?"

"Well, as men and as fellow villagers we have mich to.
talk about.

. Fellow villagers? Yamkov felt his blood boiling and
rising to his head: That expression "fellow villagers" struck
his ears as an irony, as an insult.—He felt-he-was-being de-
filed by the mouth of that sordid murderer; because it was
against these fellow villagers that his. mania and extremism
had been directed and his fellow villagers had been killed on
his instructions; killed by the rabid mob of the Party during
its first onslaught.. And among these fellow villagers whom .-
this jackal had killed there were his friends: the kind priest,
the teacher and the doctor, all those who were the heart and
mind of the village.

“Like fellow villagers?”

"Anyway, like friends. ... I want to discuss something ©
with you. It's necessary that I should have a talk with you.”

"Now I understand. That's right, be blunt about it. At
what time do you order me to be in Maa office?® :

"But. don't take it that way, Yamkov. I am not ordering
you, I’m inviting you.”

"Okay, when do you want me to come?”
"Come this afternoon, unless you'd prefer tomorrow.”

"Either today or tomorrow makes no difference to me.
I'm coming this afternoon.”

Before going there, Yamkov passed by the druggist’s
the only survivor of the circle of intellectuals, and told him
about the invitation Tinko had made to him. He was the only
man with whom he ‘spoke with confidence and-with whom he ex-
changed ideas... The druggist rose, shocked, from his desk,
affixed his spectacles with hands which were trembling, then
put his hands on Yamkov’s shoulders as if they were expressing
his love and anxiety.

"Be careful, my friend Yamkey. You are a bit hotheaded
and cannot control your tongue. Mind you don't misbehave.
Control your nerves, because we mustn't lese you. We need you,
we need you. Your home and your family and your village need
you. You must not be missing when the moment arises....”

Yamkev left, greatly moved, and with a decision to listen
to whatever they had to tell him at the People’s Committee
without expressing the disgust and indignation he felt for-
them. He had decided to be patient, to swallow his tongue, G
and to listen. quietly to all the filth of that social disgrace,
Tinko, like a little pupil of the elementary school who is
chastised by his master.

"The devil. take himi" he-spat-with-disgust.-

At the People’s Committee, apart from the two “eminent”
Party members ~ Tinko and Yanev - there was a Russian organi-
ser, a large brute with an elephant neck and with a well-
shaved Asiatic head. Through his large nostrils, which:
rhythmically closed and opened with his breathing, one felt
that one was about to see the size of his mind. it seemed
that he knew who Yamkov was, because his grey eyes were eon-
stantly fixed on him, insistently and inquiringly. Tinke
introduced him. .

"He has a son.too, a Party man, our man.” we
“Bravo, congratulations. Where is he now?" he asked.

"In .o. (he felt like saying, Hell) ... Sofia," he
corrected himself. -

"Is he studying?"

"Yes, he is studying to become a doctor." {He thought to
himself: fa leafer.")

"Fine," remarked the Russian with satisfaction. "In our
set-up we respect doctors, just as we respect every scientist.
We think highly of them. We give them the means to promote
their science for the. benefit of the whole and, of course, for
their own benefit too.”

"Yes, yes.. You love them. I have seen that with my ow
eyes," agreed. Yamkov, scarcely managing to control himself.
And there passed before his eyes the tragic scene oo the assas-..
sination of the. doctor a few days. ago.

After these words had been exchanged and he was sitting
comfortably, on his.chair, the Russian opened his legs wide,
assumed a serious air, and started the eee He spoke

_ Bulgarian. with great ease, like a Bulgarian.

"The comrades," he said, pointing to. Tinke and “‘Tanev, °
"spoke to me with flattering words about you and your home. ~
You are an honest.and industrious family, respectable persons,
and-such persons who know how to appreciate work and honesty
are valuable and dear tous. It, is even more fortunate :
because, as: I was told, you are on our side. This is only
too natural, of course, since you have your som.ec.<”

"My son. has his own ideas and I have mine," interrupted
Yamkov, who had started growing angry.

The Russian pretended not to notice the meaning of the
interruption.

"Yes, I understand. Your son, being younger and more
progressive, went further ahead. Youth has the lead. So

i was about to say...what was I saying? Oh yes, that you
have a son who could go ahead if you, too, helped, and’: ar
you aa it would be the other way. You understand what I
mean’

Yamkov felt that he was choking with acgert put. he con=
trolled himself. He swallowed his tongue.

"I understand," he said, between clenched teeth. ©
"It's good to hear that,” added the Russian. "It shows.

that you understand things in the right way, from the proper
angle, like a reasonable man and like a father." :He looked

satisfied. He thought that he had scared Yamkov with his
threatening insinuation. He thought that he had him now at
his mercy.

"And now-let us speak about the specific and interesting
question for which we invited you."

"Let us speak," the other man agreed.

"People like you are valuable for us... You are exactly
what is required in each village to serve as an example to
be followed by others, to overcome the stupid hostility of
the villagers toward our social system and thus to facilitate
its completion....Such persons offer an immense service. to.
our causé.:. That is why we give them our respect and our
confidence, and we reward them richly, both morally and mate-
rially. We know how to honor honest men.”

"Yes, indeed. .I can see that,” said Yankor and threw a
glance at. the: other two "honest men,” Yanev and Tinke.

Yamkov’s highly expressive hint did not escape the at- ~
tention of the Russian, but he pretended ‘not. te understand.
The two "honest. men" went red to the roots of their ears. and
their eyes sparkbd with anger.

"After all this,” the Russian went on, "the only thing
that remains is for me to tell you about ay proposal. You
should enter the kolihos, There you will be able to develop
all your activity, you will benefit the social whole and you
will create the fundamental pre-requisites for the proper
development and progress of your son.”

Yamkov rose. From the first words the Russian organiser-
had uttered he understood what he was about to come to. And,
of course, he did not intend to accept the proposal for
participation in the kolkhos, but had intended - following the
advice of his friend, the druggist = to express his refusal
in quiet and well chosen words. But when the Russian had
made his son's progress dependent upon his own consent to be=-
come an organ of the party - thus indirectly blackmailing
him -, and especially whem he clearly intimated. that he wanted _
him to use as the bait for his fellow villagers, his honest
and pure soul revolted. The wave of anger vida he- scarcely
managed to control broke out like qa torrent. The druggist's
prescription was cast away, forgotten.

"It seems to ne,” he replied, "that your affinity Lives
base individuals like Tinko and Yanev, and undoubte:
others still worse, has led you to believe that, all.

you would not have spoken to me about moral and material
rewards for my person, about coins of treachery, and you.
wouldn't have threatened me with the ‘development’ of my
good-for-nothing son. Oh no, Mr. Russian, you are wrong
in thinking ‘that all the Bulgarians take after your

He put on his hat and left with dignity.

The. others: remained there, stupified be spellbound,
looked at. the departing Yamkov.

When he had overcome the surprise which had. stupified
him, Tinko got hold of his revolver and hastened to reach

aware of this. But the Russian organiser stopped him...

"No nonsensé; This isn't the time for it. We shall
think over how and when and where it must be done.*

And he did think about it. A few days later Need was.
found dead. in a field outside the village. He had been...

- stabbed with wild ferocity.

Tinko and the militia made every effort to find the mur-
derers. -And they found them. They were two peasants, two
stolid and incorrigible anti-Communists, who, according to
their own ‘confession’, written and signed before the militia, |
had committed the murder because they were informed. that
Yamkov had registered for participation in the kolkhos and
because he insistently and persistently had urged his fellew

he had "signed,” were taken over by the kolkhoz.

Uniem so heavily stepped upon and frightened by the self-willed
and evil activity of the Doctor and those who circle around him. H

MEMORANDUM 18 April 1951

To: Oliver G. Martell

Fran: Terence U. Nasmith

Subject: . The Hanging of Lyle 0. Kelly.

uw The most serious accusation against Kelly is based upon
the’ developments w® regard to Kelly's comection with the French.
He told us about recent contacts he made with Pierre and Mrs.
Florimond from Salonika. He denied that he had ever had con-
tacts Be them previously. We have learned from Ogive that,
inl Kelly worked for Florimond.

On ‘Thursday April 12 Kelly stated that fe was to tell
Florimond. by. Friday, April 13, whether or not he would work with
hin. Kelly asked.us for instructions. We told Kelly his answer.
was to be a.definite, final no. In other words he was never to
ges see the French again. We know definitely, however, that Kelly
& -saw Florimond on Friday, on Saturday and on Tuesday. On Tuesday © a
B he saw also a..certain French Assistant. Military Attache named Piray.

Yani Kolomonos, Kelly's friend, stated that Kelly has
agreed to meet Piray at the French Embassy between 11 and 12. o'clock..
on Thursday, April 19. At this meeting Kelly will (1) givethe  -
Frenchman detailed accounts of all U. S. operations of.
which he is aware, with special emphasis-on Radio Gorianin, and (2}
receive for this information 10 to 15 million drachmae.

It is.imperative that this meeting be stopped. For :
instance, two of the Dreamer radio announcers are known to Kelly i
and hated by Kelly. “Since they have relatives inside Dreamland. their:
our ‘position should be as secure as possible.

Our. Greek informant suggests, not without plausibility,
that this effort of the Erench might be Communist-inspired attempt.
to penetrate U..S. intelligence activities. The Greek bases his a
guess only upon the reasoning that normal French intelligence activities
would not be so interested in penetrating U..S. work, since ~~
allegedly -~ we are close allies.

2. We accuse Kelly also of manyyproven lies and of theft of
funds. These malpractices, known to us through personal observation”
over a period of several months, include such things as the following

a. Kelly stated that he wrote three books, for which he
was paid a sum of money. He did not write the books as he
himself has testified on the enclosed photostat of a document
which he signed. ,

b. .On one occasion

fer- YG HS



Ae Ck ek

b. On one occasion Nasmith personally gave Kelly $300

in dollars for an option on his books. Kelly. signed a
receipt for this. Kelly showed a signed copy of the receipt
to the true author, stating that he could not divide the
money’ with the author since, although he had signed the
receipt, he had not received any money ~~ that Mr. Nasmith
had forced him to sign the receipt so that Nasmith could
steal the $300 for himself.

c.: Money given to Kelly specifically for the purpose of
paying salaries to the members of his Committee was not
turned over to the Committee in its entirity. Kelly stated on
several occasions definitely. that he no longer had any
connections with Greek authorities. At the time he was making
these Statements he was observed by our people to be going into
the Aliens Directorate, Radio Athens, and other official. Greek
residences.. (Note: | We wereppaeasddtto have Kelly maintain
contact with Greek officials; we.dislike only his lying about

d. On at.least 4 occasions Kelly has stated unequivocally
that he had no relations with Ibrahim Mohammed, A friendly
observer..saw Kelly pay Mohammed gold pounds prior to Mohammed's
tetent trip to Turkey. Furthermore, mysterious receipts have

: appeared in Kelly's accounts signed by Ibrahim Mohammed.

It is interesting to note that aroused by our continued
interest in Ibrahim, Kelly has given-us a long song and dance --
intending to force us to drop the subject -- about. Ibrahim's
being a Greek spy.

e.- On one occasion Kelly told us about having received
money from Major Nikoloupolos of the Aliens Directorate. . This
is'(1) an obvious attempt to drive a wedge between our closely
cooperating organizations, and (2) evidence of Kelly's untrust~-
worthiness.

f. Kelly has been warned repeatedly to maintain as good
security as possible regarding the purpose for which he has
rented offices at 13 Patissia Street... Nevertheless, Kelly has
blabbed his business (and ours!) all over Athens, so that be fsve
constantly visited by all manner of unnecessary people including
a galaxy of street-walkers.

g- Helly maintains constant relations with several people-.
who seem unduly interested in our wrk. We do not attempt
to dictate his friends but we do consider it improper when he
deliberately lies in denying to us that he sees such people.
(Example: A certain Papas, an elderly Greek who seems to be
working with the French Mission here.

3. In addition to the serious charges which we have against

Kelly as indicated above, there is the additionel charge equally

serious but less.



-3-

serious but. less ‘specific, that he appears: actually to be-insane,
to be suffering from @blusions. of grandeur (meflomania). For
instance, his many references to his future rol& as prime minister
of Bulgaria, and his illustrative: anecdotes regarding the purpose
of the. meeting recently held between the members of the Committee
and Mr. Manfield.

4. It .is recommended urgently that Kelly be removed immediately
from circulation and that the Aliens Directorate be kind enough to.
discuss with us in the next few days or weeks what. Beam solution
we may evolve for the Kelly menace.

mom sE/2

SUBJECT: Lyle O, KELLY :

1s In accordance with your instructions received through Mr, Donald Fe
Ewing, CSE/2, and in coordination with Mr. Mahoney of WH Division, I flew to
DTROBALO, arriving there at noon on 26 May 1953, for the purpose of determining
whether Subject bas current operational information concerning SE operations
and personnel that would make him a security risk if he were allowed to re~
settle within the next calendar year,

2..Upon arrival at DTROBALO I discussed the case with KELLY's case
officer, Mr. Philip A, Tocmey, and the Station Security Officer and learned
that KELLY had been in detention until approximately 15 May when he’ was. released
from confinement and’ allowed to attend classes and live with other persons who
are being prepared for resettlements

30 Between 1300 and 1600 hours on 26 May, I reviewed the DTROBALO Station
files on KELLY and made an appointment with KELLY's case officer to have a con—
ference with KELLY at 0800 hours 27 May, It was decided to use the office of
the Station Security Officer for the meeting because of its invuherability to
other agents and to the laborers who were working in the area, ‘he Security
Officer stated that the office would be made available for the time specified. °

he At 0800 hours 27 May KELLI's case officer escorted me to the prow
arranged meeting site and introduced me as Mike Vargas to KELLY who bad been:
waiting in the office, The case officer informed KELLY that I had arrived fran
Washington, D. C, to discuss his problems with him and would endeavor to resolve
all matters possible, KELLY appeared elated and in broken English said that he
was very happy to learn that the organization (I presume he meant CIA) finally
acknowledges him asa friend, KELLY stated that he has been waiting 25 months
to speak to someone from Washington. “The case officer departed fromthe rocm and
left KELLY and me standing in the center of the rooms I asked KELLT to be
Seated and told him that I speak Serbo-Croatian and inquired if he understood
Serbo-Croatian, KELLY replied that he does speak Serbian and is glad that I
speak the language also because his English was not fluent and he has difficulty
expressing himself. All conversations hereafter were conducted in Serbo-Croatian,

5- I opened the conversation by telling KELLY that hie reports and letters
were received and studied very carefully at Washihgton and assured him that
pressing duties made it impossible for anyone to visit him at any time prior to
the present. KELLY replied that he felt relieved that he was not forgotten by
his friends and that he could now reveal everything that has been a puzzle to.

for certain actions that were directed against him, KELLY stated that he was
imprisoned a few times and that he suffered terribly during those. periods
because of his inability to withstand imprisoments

6 In order that I might have a clear picture of his background and
initial contacts with the Americans in Sofia and later in Athens, as well as
his associations with other intelligence services in Bulgaria and Greece, KELLY
stated that he preferred to start from the beginning of his clandestine work in
Bulgaria and chronologically bring me up to date on his activities and ensuing
events, “Since mich of KELLY's discussion is repeated in a report he had pre=
viously prepared and which is in his files and since a great deal of the dis~
cussion had no direct bearing on the purpose of the mission, I will for the sake
of brevity and clarity avoid those portions of his story.

Jo According to KELLY, the’ highlights of his background and activities

are as follows: When the Commnist regime gained conttol in Bulgaria he realized
the poaition the people of Bulgaria were placed in and that under Commnisa

the people were not going to be any better off than they were under the Fascists
or Nazis. The only salvation for the Bulgarian people was for the Democratic
powers to achieve control and thereby extend their form of government. to the
Bulgarian people. He'therefore proceeded to exploit Bulgaria with a view to
organizing adherents into clandestine groups in order toorerthrow the Commnist
government that was in control. KELLY stated that he had organised over 250
cells consisting of seme 10,000 persons throughout Bulgaria and Macedonia.

8. According to KELLY,in 1945 he met the American General Crane in Sofia
and the General requested KELLY to prepare a program of hie organization out~
lining its mission, functions, etcs. Upon complying with this request KELLY
stated that General Crane informed him that his program was very favorable and
that he (General Crane) desired KELLY to work for him, KELLY said he agreed
and proceeded personally to exploit the cells of his organization in Bulgaria.

9s “In 196 while KELLY was inspecting units of his organization in Bulgaria

he was arrested by the Commnists and tried and found guilty on four counts and
imprisoned, According to KELLY the only reason he was not given the death
sentence was because the Communists had hoped to use him as a witness against
Nikola Petkov, Agrarian leader in Bulgaria who was also fomenting unrest among
the Agrarian factions, KELLY contimed by stating that he remained in prison
for approximately six months near Vratea where he was tortued by the police in
an effort to extract from him information on his organization and people with
whom he was associated, particularly Americans, KELLY said he did not reveal
the information which the police desired, 5

10,.Early in 1947 through members of his organization he was able to make
his escape from the prison. He made his way to Sofia where he tried to contact
General Crane, but learned that General Crane was no longer in Sofia and that
his replacement was a Mr. Horne (probably John Horner, Chapge d'Affaire A.I.
of the Political Mission in Sofia), Through the Mission secretary, KELLY made
an appointment to see Mr. Hopne and when he did meet him Mr. Horne told him

that he was not

be :

that he was not aware of anything that had existed between KELLY and General
Crane, but for KELLY to telephone him several days later, KELLY stated that he
telephoned Mr. Horne a week later but received no satisfactory response fron
hime

11, KELLY realizing that he vas wanted in Bulgaria by the police for his
escape from prison proceeded to work his way out of Bulgaria, He was assisted
by one Fancha Fernandova near Plovdiv, On crossing the Bulgarian border into
Greece KELLY stated that he surrendered to a Greek patrol who imediately :
channeled him through its interrogation center. During this process KELLY. said
he was approached by British Intelligence, a Mr. Andros (possibly Andrews) ‘and
Mr, Scott, and was told that the British had heard of his organization and
wanted him to work for them, KELLY refused the offer and told the British that

he preferred to work with the Americans, KELLY also said that the Greek IS

had asked him to work for them, and that he refused them also. He was then
placed in a refugee camp in Athens with other Bulgarian refugees. -

12, In 1949 during KELLY's stay in the refugee camp he said that he learned
the art of making trinkets as a trade and was allowed to leave the refugee camp
and seek employment ina shop where he could contime his trade.’ He found a
shop that offered him.a job and he accepted. He stated that he had no intentions —
of making a liviihood in that occupation but it did give him an opportunity to
get out of the refugee camp and contime to seek means to combat the Commnists
in Bulgaria, While on this job KELLY met a Greek woman by the name of Flora
Yavanou who said she had an aunt who lives in Chicago, Illinois, Since they both
wished to go to the United States, they decided to get married and, with an
affidavit of support from Flora's Aunt, get visas td the U. S... Their next
move was to. get to. Italy through IRO channelse i

13 KELLY claims that he did not kmow the Aunt's address or name other
than that she was referred to as Teresa, KELLY said that he and Flora planned
to separate on reaching the United States, According to KELLY, he checked with ~
the THO in Athens and learned that because he was a Bulgarian immigrant he was
eligible for emigration through IRO and since Flora had probable means of getting —
him to the United States he decided to go through with the plan. ‘He married
Flora in February 1949 and by the latter part of March they were en route to

Italye

«Uke While in Italy KELLY stated that Flora commnicated with her Aunt in
Chicago who was preparing to process the necessary affidavit for their entry ~
into the United States, However, during this period KELLY learned that Flora
was pregnant and according to Italian Immigration officials she could not be
considered for emigration from Italy until after the birth of her child, On
Learning this, KELLY said his whole plan had collapsed and that he could not go
through with it. He decided tozeturn to Athens and leave his wife with her
parents, They returned to Athens in October 1949. A daughter was born in
November 1949 :

15. Now that he had returned to Athens KELLY's intentions were to earn
sufficient funds ($2000) to build a hame for his daughter. He was not con
cerned with Flora as he had married her for the purpose of getting to the
United States. The marriage was to be a temporary affair as they were not in
love with each other and had no intentions of remaining married, Our information
shows that KELLY worked for the Propaganda Section of the Greek General Staff
headed by Lt. Colonel M, A, Alexandralcis on his return to Athense In order to
earn money KELLY. decided to write several books on anti-Commnism, Since he
was not fluent. in Greek ‘be sought the assistance of a Greek scholar who could
translate his writings from Bulgarian into Greek, KELLY said he wrote two
texts and turned them over to a Greek educator to translates

16. In Bugust 1950 KELLY decided to take his texts to the American Enbassy
in Athens and inquire as to the possibility of having the texts translated into
English’ and published in the United States. He said he was directed to a re
Ewning (probably Mr, Donald F, Ewing); Chief of Information Service, who in turn
Antwoduced him to a Mr. Willard Allan also an official at the American Enbassy
in Athens, KELLY stated that after several meetings with Mr. Allan he was asked
by Mr. Allan to work with the Americans, KELLY immediately voluntesred and was
told’in order to get an organization that could accomplish its mission he would
need several assistants. He explored the Layrion refugee camp for potential staff
personnel and was given the names of Ivan Hristonov and Ivan and Dimitur Doneve
Upon the suggestion of the. /mericans, KELLY said he accepted the persons namede
He established a headquarters and proceeded planning operations to penetrate
Bulgaria, KELLY claimed the Greeks and certain Bulgarian emigre leaders in
Greece were opposed to his position with the Americans and did
possible to belittle his. position and impair his operations, ‘The results of
KELLY's abortive missions into Bulgaria are contained in a report which KELLY
prepared at DIROBALO and whish is now in his files :

17. ‘During the period in which he was trying to get his operations
mounted into Bulgaria, KELLY was approached by the French IS to work for theme
KELLY stated that he inmediately informed his American superiors regarding the
French approach and was thereafter directed by the Americans in his dealings
and associations with the French IS.

18, KELLY listed the following American personnel with whom he coordinated
all his activities : The Chief, name unknown to KMLLY —probably Mr. MacLean, -
Mr, Willard Allan, Miss Vera (ur. Allan's secretary), Mrs. Kingsley
(connected with the Radio Station), Mr. George and Mr, Clef (training officers).
KELLY referred to the following Balgarian personnel as having been associated
with his organization and with whom he was acquainted:. Ivan Hristonov, whom he
believes supplanted him in the organization in Athens; Ivan and Dimitur Donsv,
whom he claims are presently in Argentina; Choyo.Stonovski (probably Stoyo
Chonovski); Anden Andonev; Gospodin Gospodinov; Hristo Traikov; Vasil Yanchev;
Rafail Karskachanov; Dinitur Tabakov; Todor Hadjiev and Ivan Gagove

1g. KELLY.continued by stating that he was apprehended by the Greek Police,
allegedly for safe. keeping ‘in April 1951. He was placed in detention and re~
mained under Greek control until his departure from Greece to Frankfurt by air.
From Frankfurt he was transported to Panama where he arrived on § Septenber 1951.
He was placed in detention at a hospital in Panama and was of the opinion that
perhaps the hespital was an exterminating establishment for undesirables, Later,
however, he said he learned otherwise and through a friend, Mr. Stanley, learned

that he was sent to Panama to undergo several physical check-ups and that after

that was completed he would be removed to an area some 50 miles away where he
would enjoy full freedom, . Also. that he would remain at his new location long
enough to learn a language and prepare himself for resettlement. When he in-
quired how long that would be he was told that would be about six months,

20, In March 1952. KELLY was transferred to DTROBALO, He stated that he
remained at DTROBALO for six months and after that period he confronted the
authorities concerning his release and resettlement. Appraximately one month
later KELIM said he informed the Station authorities that he would leave the
area if they did not release him as initially promised. He stated that he was”
apprehended and placed in confinement until his release in May 1953.

~' 21, KELLY advised that the above is a true account of his past ex-
periences and in view of my limited stay in DTROBALO would appreciate any answer
I could give him regarding questions that have never been resolved and con
sequently have disturbed him, KELLY apparently had a list of questions prepared
which he drew from a notebook and proceeded to read. ‘The questions were as
follows: ~

a@. Why was he apprehended by the Greek Police?
be Why was he placed in confinement in Panama and later at DYROBALO?
Ge How much longer must he remain at DIROBALO?

a, Is there any possibility of his working with the organization
(CIA) to complete the misaion he initiated?

e. What happened to the texts he wrote that werstaken to the —
United States by Mr. Willard Allan?

f. Why haven't any of his old ‘friends visited him during the pass
* two years?

ge In regards to his family —KELLY stated that only as a last
resort and only if he had to remain at DTROBALO would he want his family
there. He would prefer working and saving sufficient money($2000) to
purchase or build a home for them in Greece and drop the whole matters

In resphnse to the above questions I told Kelly that:

negotiation with the French IS.

be He was placed in confinement at Panama to, undergo mental. and
physical check-ups to assure his recovery from the ordeal which he had
undergone, ° His confinement at DTROBALO was to prevent his contemplated
and ‘announced escapes

co. KELLY's stay at DTROBALO apparently is dependent on his quali-
fications.to mest resettlement requirements. I told him I was. not able to
gudge when he had fulfilled those requirements, ‘There was also the task
involved of finding suitable positions for individuals with varied sidlls
in South’ 4mericas

d. I told KELLY that there was no opportunity for hin to work with
the organization because the ze and organization as known to him are no
longer existent,

eo I told KELLY that I believe the texts were returned to Greece ca
but that I would make a further check on my return to Washington, -

. f. KELLY was told that the people wham he knew in Athens and Sofia
were no longer with the organization and therefore it was impossible for.
theg to visit him,

g. I told KELLY that I did not lmow anything about his wife’and child
other than the’ fact that KELLY was married and that his wife and child
resided in Athens. I again queried KELLY concerning his wishes regarding
his family, .KELLY asked how long it would take to bring the family to
South America if that were possible. I replied that I had no definite
‘answer, KELLY said that only if he knew he bad to remain at DTRORALO
indefinitely would he request to have his wife and child vith him

COMEENTS AND RECQMMENDATIONS: ~

A, I found KELLY to be a frail, nervous, alert, and extremely talkative
person, During the twelve hour conference with KEILY I frequently interrupted -
him to query him on persons and activities he referred to in his story only to
find bim replying. briefly and persistently requesting to be allowed to continue
relating his thoughts and feelings.

By In relating his story of the organization he established and members
who comprised the organization KELLY appeared to have a clear and concise
picture of operations he directed and names and descriptions of people with wham
he had come in contact)

C. It is my opinion that KELLY knows little about operations in Greece.
I believe KELLY was so wrapped up in his own abortive missions and personnel
difficulties while in Greece that he paid little, if any, attention to operations
that were running concurrently, KELLY mentioned nares of agents who are bing
currently used in Bulgarian operations; however, he referred to then as Bulgarians

whom he had met

( Sebi
Security Information «= +
-T~

_

whom he had met in Athens and tried to recruit for his organization, or else

he had been told of them by other sources, In reply to queries and in his own
story, he made no statement which would indicate that he is cognizant of current
Bulgarian operations.

D. I feel confident that KELLY redlizes that his chances of reauming his
role in Greece are at an end and therefore he has resolved to do the next best
thing and that is to contact a former Greek companion (Mr. Karapides) who is a
successful business man in Caracas, Venezuela and seek employment. KELLY is
eager to be resettled and to get out of DIROBALO,

E. I recognize that KELLY is familiar with certain former operations and
agents involved in those operations which, if revealed to unauthorized persons,
could become embarrassing, However, I feel that KELLY's knowledge of current
operations is so minute that the security risks involved to our current operations
would be very little, if any, if he were resettled, Therefore, my recommendation
is to process himfor resettlement.

2. For your information in making ultimate disposition of this case, 7h
this Division has reached the conclusion, based on facts set forth in the tidue
following paragraphs, that Kelly, if released from confinementj will be a
source of serious embarrassment to CLA.

3e: Subject, @ Bulgarian refugee in Greece, was the principal agent
in an ill-fsted. operation run from October 1950 to March 1951.. The
operation resulted ina major expose and trial in Sofia during 1951. The
agents used were those selected by Subject, at least one of whem was
Probably an operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the detrayer
of his colleagues. ;

4e Subject's behavior during his employment wae extraordinarily bad

whelly unsubstantiated. bapa phe pil wd refed ae He was
born 7 May 192) in Medkovets, Bulgaria, studied philology in
1942-43 at the University of Sofia. Th 1942 he joined a eearet branah
of the Bulgarian Hational Agrarian Union and worked elesely with Dr.
Georgi M. Dimitrov in anti-Fascist activities (a claim which Dr.
Dimitrov has denied.) After emerging briefly fron hiding in September
1944, he again went underground, engaging in anti-Communist activities:
4n various cities and towns in Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Macedonia
where be'urged nebers of the Agrarian Party to take action againet

the Camsunists. In October 1946 he was arrested by the police,
sentenced to death, but not executed as the Coumunists wished to use
hin as a witness against the Agrarian Leader Mikola Petkcr. On 23: daly
1947 he ssonped to Gresee.

3. Further Light is throw on Kelly's experiences in a mami~
soript which he claimed to have written and delivered to U. 3.
authorities in Greece with the prupose of finding a publisher for
this, and other, material. It subsequently developed that Kelly was
not the author of these papers but rather had furnished information
to @ Greek friend (John Calavancs) whe was the real author, A rough
translation of one of these documents is enclosed.

4. Because of his undeniable organizational ability, trenendoos
energy and glib, but largely untruthful, salesmanship, Keliy was able
to organize 4 group of Bulgarian imigrante in Greece inte what he -
called the Bulgarian Democratic Blos, His use by this agency was
believed advisable inasmch as his organization provided the
for recruiting infiltration agents within a shorter time and with
fewer political strings attached than any other exigre groups. Further—
more, his organisation provided a convenient naze for use as a front to
cover operational activities. As a result of the limited recognition

1.Financial Finagling in Greece RuLGARIAY

(a) In February, 1951, when Kelly was head of. the’Semocratic Bloc,
three of his men arrived-in Athens, coming directly from IRO camps.

They needed. shelter, but had no money, They were put on salary, tut it
was not enough to cover the sixmonths advance rent which it is the custom
to pay when.a lease is made in Athens, Thys Kelly's advance account was
credited with auxamaxkr the amount of $850, which was to be used
to pay the rental advance, The three men were to pay it back in monthly
installments.

Two such installments were paid by the men when Kelly was “interned”
ty our people. The-men were then able to complain that Kekky had forced
them into quarters best described as “very inadequate, insecuream and
unhealthy." i

Comparing the quality of the quartess with the amount advanced for
rent,it becomes quite certain thet Kelly made some sort of deal with the
landlord.in order to make some money.

It showla be kept in mind that Kelly forced three of his own countrymen
to live in these quarters, from which they were forthwith removed for
health and security. reasons.

pants, “pans off HISTORY OF LYLE KELLY

(>) Just prior to his removal, it was discovered that Kelly had a
cash shortage of over: #100 which was not accounted. for in any way.When
on attempt was made to collect the money, At vas Alecovered that Kelly
had spent it. on himself,

2, Runicxiipiomte Manuscript Episode

In. December, 1950, Willard Allen, in accordance with a promise made
to Kelly, brought with him to this country three mamuscripts, ostensibly
itten by Kelly. Allen was. to see what he could do to have these manu-
sripts published here, Kelty hoped to thus exploit and dramatize hie
escape from Bulgaria, de was given, by us, a $300 advance on the publi-
cation of the manuscrapts.

On December 14, 1951, in a conversation with Mr, Allen, it was learned
vy us that Zelly had not written the mamscripts at all. Allen learned this
himself when the real author wrote to him demanding the return of his
works, The author said.that he had a statement from Kelly disclaiming all
credit for the manuscripts. furthermore, the real author had seen nothing
of the $300 giwen to Kelly, although they apparently had agreed to go
50-50 on any profits realized from the publication of the manuscripts.

His clear that Kelly lied to us, and used someone else's Literary
talentsin the hope of gaining noteriety and money himself,

3. Relations with the French

In early 1951, Kelly informed our people in Athens that a Hrench
Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him in the hope of getting Kelly
to work withxkkexea for his country, Kelly was allowed by us to contime
seeing this man until it was determinedijust what the French wanted in the
way of information. This point was reached, and Kelly was told not to see
his Frenchman or ary Frenchmen after a certain Thursday. We know Setinktely
that Kelly saw saw his Frenchman on the following Friday, Saturday, and

Tuesday.

We a6 not know what was said, but from a source whom we have no reason
to doubt, (an ex-friend of Kelly's who deserted Kelly and came to us to
warn us of €ax the situation with the French ) we learned that for a sum
amounting to 16,000,000 drachmae, Kelly had agreed to give the French the
names of all the American staffinvolved in plans to infiltrate Bulgaria,
umsmgplus information on Radio @urtatéw Gorianin. Kelly was immediately
picked up by the Greek Alien Directorate, acting upom orders from Heary
McLean.

4, Reaction of Othera to Kelly

(a) The Senior Representative of OPC in Athens, Sept. 1951

“Kelly was a notoriously insecure, disrepatable, opportunistickme
indimidual over whom control, other than physical, was next to impossible
to exercise.....He hada positive genius for troubke-making intrigue,
rare even in this part.of the world; his continued presence in Greece
would have rendered impossible any oiligg of the stormy Bulgarian refugee
waters here, Kelly was tied in even more closely than other Bulgarian
agents with the Embassy here,,,, and could be counted on to use that fact,
xxvimmdinmanonond a matter of common knowledge in the Bulgarian colony, to
his own. advantage and to, the disadvantege of the best interests of ¥. S,
Sovernment policy."

(b) Chief of Station, OPC in Athens, Nay 1951

"Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially irresponsible Irish
natare. Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to.be equally
stupid, Early in our relations with Xelly,.., we foresaw the need to curb
Kelly or to eliminate him from our operations. Since, however, he was
still necessary to us, we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching
him the while, Kelly, unfortunately, did nof learn- he got worse. He
"borrowed! and stole-money from many sources. he lied to many people,

more serious when Kelly's closest friend,.., deserted Kekky and came to
us apparently. in an honest desire to safeguard America and the struggle
against Commnisn from further involvement with a character es shady as
Kelly. ... Since that time we have tmaket examined more closely into t

SUBJECT: ©. Lyle 0. Kelly

Tt occurs to me, lying happily upon my hepatitic bed as I am, that

some sort 68 a statement regarding the "demise" of Lyle 0. Kelly might
be in order "for the record". I shall discuss two aspects of Kelly in

» this memorandm, ‘apologizing in advance for the vagueness of the dis~

cussion which 1s due, I shall maintain, to my present horizontal position
far from records, calendars and the recollectionful clink of the Iamailic

gold pound.
1. The good of Lyle 0. Kelly.

In the summer of 1950 QkStair was in the ridiculous position of
being unable to do anything because the alien support on which it de-

pended, allegedly forthcoming from the reverend Dr. Glantz, was not

forthcoming. In-a bit of a tizsy, anxious to get cracking, we picked

up Lyle 0. Kelly. We suspected at the time that he was not the mw

“white hope", but we needed someone through whom we could obtain bodies.

We obtained bodies shrough Kelly and actually have accomplished scne
substantive work. it must be remembered that Kelly performed a
useful service for us. a

2. The bad of Lyle 0, Kelly.
Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially irresponsible

Irish nature. Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to

be equally stupid. Early in our relations with Kelly, before I left

LCDrink in October, we foresaw the need to curb Kelly or to eliminate
him from our operations. Since, however, he was still necessary to us,

we tried to use him, restraining him and teaching him the while.

Kelly, unfortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He "bor-
rowed" and stole money from many sources, He lied to many people, in-
cluding us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he per-

sisted in considering himself the forthcoming Minister-President of
Dreamland.

‘secgeT. OC

Things took a serious turn when Kelly's committee, men he
himself had chosen, came to us behind his back complaining about hin,
This became more serious when his "closest" friend, a Flake, the man
who had actually written the books for which Kelly took credit, de~
serted Kelly and came to us apparently in an honest desire to safe-
guard America andthe struggle against Commnism from further invelve-
ment-with a character as shady as Kelly. .

The most serious matter, one which could not be ignored, in-
volved.Kelly's relations with the HBFairies. Kelly had advised us that
‘a Fairy Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him with regard to work-
ing. together. We. told Kelly he might go ahead and contime his relations
with this gentleman until we learned exactly what the gentleman wanted.
We learned what was wanted and advised Selly he was not repeat not to see
the Fairy’ agent, or any other Fairies, after a certain Thursday. We know ©»)
definitely that Kelly did see this Fairy on the Following Friday, Satur- »
day, snd Tussday.

We do not Imow what he discussed with the Fairy but we have no
reason to doubt the word of hie Flake friend vhieh is essentially as
follows:

: That the Fairies were interested primarily in the.”
names’ and numbers of all the players (us, that is) in
plens for infiltration of Dreamland, in informetion on
Radio Gorianin, etc.; that Kelly had agreed to sell
‘this information to the Fairies for a sum. of 16,000,000
drachmse and that he had an appointment to complete the
transaction at 11 o'clock the following morning.

On this information we had Kelly picked up, and are now troubled vith
the question of disposing of bin.

Since that time we have exmined nore closely into a
affair and have found more lies, more secret agreements, more

fonds, more of that good, Irish whimsicality for which Kelly ts already

so famous. (Note that even if the hearsay evidence regarding the sell- a
out to the Fairies is erroneous <- although it is backed by several in-
dependent bits of substential evidence - we still have enough proof of
‘untrustworthiness to have a comphete case against Kelly.) We cannot
continue with Kelly. He is finished.

(It is pertinent to note that Kelly's committee, and his party
in general, feel no feeling of loss since his removal from active politics.
Not a single person has asked about him except his wife - whome he con—
tinuously disowned - who wanted only to know how she might get in touch
with him to ask him for some money. The committee and refugees in

L6Fleke in general, are in much better spirits than,they have ever been
before. Kelly's removal is in every way a tonic. )



~T.repeat, however, that at certain juncture in our efforts,
Belly represented the first and only alien body we had and, however un-
wittingly and briefly, served his country well. One hopes he will

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: "Development, of the Rift with DIMITRI A. DIMITROV
1, Biography: (See 104 CAGHWU, dated 4 October 1950). Born 7 May

192k in Medkovets, Bulgaria. Edication—studied philology for one year
at Sofia University, 1942-43. In 1942 joined: secret branch of the

* Bulgarian National Agrarian Union. . Claims to have begun underground,

anti-Fascist activities in 1943 in Macedonia and to have worked closely
with Dr. G, M..Dimitroy during this time, After emerging briefly from
hiding in September 1944, he again went underground engaging in anti-

“Communist activities, touring various cities and towns, (including

sections of Yugoslav/Macedonia) and urging members of the Agrarian party
to: take positive action against the Commnists. In October, 1946, he
was arrested by the police. He believes the reason he was not executed
was that the Communists wished to use him as witness against Nikola

"Petkov. On 23 July 19/7 he escaped to Greece.

2. Initial operation: (See Athe 3200 (IN 46672), 25 Octeber 1950)

° Tn Oeteber, 1950, the OXSTAIR Field Chief learned of Dimitrov through

the local peripheral reporting officer and contacted him covertly.
Dimitrov made six agents immediately available for infiltration operations.
Three of these six were successfully infiltrated on 10 December,

leaflets signed in the name of the Bulgarian Democratic Bloc, the emigre
political group organized and headed by Dimitrov.

3, Subsequent activities: Dimitrov has supplied an additional 21
agents for QKSTAIR infiltration operations, 15 of whom have just com
pleted training in Germany and are being prepared for infiltration by
mid-May.

he Origins of QKSTAIR break with Dimitrov:

a. In Athe 4821, IN 30224, Manfield reported on 22 March that —.-:—---

he was considering breaking off association with Dimitrov because —
he had become too unpopular and dictatorial and self-important.
There were also indications of serious misappropriation of funds.
Manfield felt that Dimitrov's group could continue to be utilized
under the leadership of Ivan Doney Ivanov.

b. In Athe 5150 (IN 36130) dated 20 April 1951, Manfield
cabled that he had had the Greek Aliens Directorate pick up Dimitrov
and put him under protective arrest for the reasons indicated above
and because Dimitrov mag about to sell out to the French. (This
was discovered through an OPC penetration of Dimitrov's organization. )
He also requested instructions on how to dispose of Dimitrov for
@ period of three months, which he felt was sufficient time in
which to render him harmless to QXSTAIR operations.

SEGRE™ Lole VG age

Pia



c.- Wash 38789 (OUT 97616) dated 21 April 1951 stated that
there were no facilities in the United States. or Germany for han~ _
dling Dimitrov and pointed out that temporary disposal for three
months. would be insufficient in view of Dimitrov's detailed
knowledge of the names of present agents and his general famil—
darity with QXSTAIR infiltration operations. It was suggested
that the posaibility of indefinite confinement by the Greele In-

- telligence Service should be explored.

ds) Fran 2910’ (IN 36297) dated 21 April 1952 confirmed that
there were no facilities in Germany for holding Dimitrov and sug~
gested ‘that he be assassinated.

at DTROBALO, and then spent twelve hours talking to KELLY, As a result of

this, it has been ascertained to our satisfaction that KELLY does not appear to

made to resettle him in South America, Our only request is that this Division.

steps taken to resettle KELLY, In this connection it should be pointed out
that KELLY has a wife and child in Greece, When queried by Major Hemovich
about them, he professed no.interest in having the wife or child join him,
stating that he would like to provide some-money-for the-support. of the child

is therefore our intention to have KELLY write his wife a letter telling her

that he will provide her with a certain sum of money for the child, (This sum
