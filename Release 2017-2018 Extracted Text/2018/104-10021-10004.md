CUBAN IN “DALEAy TEXAS, U.S.A)... eu

" MIGUEL CASAS SAEZ, 22 or 23 yeas of age, born in Remedios, Las Villas, ©
Cuba,’ son of Joaquin CASAS (Alias) "Quintello", (this family is called
by everyone "Los Quintellos") and'of Georgina SAEZ Lopez, known as "la
China", they live in an old wooden house at the end of Ariosa St.,

.without number, at the said city. of Remedios, L.V. We don't have his
background before the revolution, maybe because he was so young, but
after it, he became an ardent revolutionary, follower of Raul. Castro.

- He went through the Department of Constructions of ,the Ministry of :
Education at the same time that he was a militiaman in Remedios, where
.he was known on account of doing more than what was required of him.
Later -he was transferred to the State Security Department (G-2), which

was no secret to anyone because of the way hetstiaved. From time to

time he was gone from the city of Remedios, a thing that didn't amaze

of bothered anyone because of the quality of thg person. .

: a

His aunt, Lucia LOPEZ MARRIED TO MR. WILFREDO RUTSSCH, a former , .»

_ shoemaker in Cambjuani, head-town of the municipality next to Remedios;
this couple live on the Andres Cuevas St. #54 at the mentioned tgym

of Camajuani, L.V. Now this Ruissch is in charge of the Trust of Leather
which takes care 6f the distribution of Unit #402 of the Shoemaker§ of
Camajuani; she (Lucia Lopez), upon a visit to the dentist, whom I have
known for many years as a responsible arid serious person, she expressed’
herself in the following manner: -------c-r--o mere nn nn nner terme cnn ree

"My nephew "Miguelito", has just arrived from the U.S., he was in, Dallas
Texas, on the day of the assassination of Kennedy, but he managed‘to :
leave through the frontier of Laredo; atready in Mexico a FAR plarie.
brought him to Cuba¥ she continued to say, "you know that he is one

of Raul's men (refexing to Raul Castro); Miguelito is very brave,

very brave!"

The informant, dentist of the mentioned aunt, says he knows the so callec
Miguelito, he is five feet ten inches tall tst-10"), dark, strong .
complexion, dark brown hair, brown eyes, crazy about Castro. He Rad
firing practice while in the militias and the doctor considers this

man capable of doing anything.

Immediately I called two of my-best men in Camajuani, one of them a
shoemaker who knows Wilfredo Russch very well and I gave him instructions
on this matter, but I didn't tell them toomuch of what I knew; the
results, according to what they ijust informed me confirms what was
stated in such a way that only this remains to be said:

'"M.C.S. was a poor person, poorly dressed, and after he was missing
from Remedios for several weeks but this was not strange due to his
condition of militiaman and indoctrinated revolutionary, but now he
dresses well, has a lot of money, owns large amounts of T-shirts,
jackets and shoes. all American made. The rumers are that he has given
some pairs of shoes to some of his friends. "They were in a bar near
him and were able to observe that the shoes they were wearing were
American made".

It seems that he departed from Dallas Texas with two friends, and the
Dentist believes he is following the tracks of one of them. If I have
had any means of transmitting this message, you would have known about
it at least ten days ago, but we have no other means to do it.
