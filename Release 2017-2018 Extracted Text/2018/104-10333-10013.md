FROM:

SUBJECT:

Secrecy Agreements with Commission Members

1. At your request, PRD searched its files to find information on how secrecy

agreements have been handled vis a vis members of commissions dealing with

intelligence-related matters. There have been three instances of PRD interface with such

commissions. The first was in 1994 when the Joint Security Commission requested a

PRB review on its report on Counterintelligence and Security Policies, Procedures and

Practices in the CIA in the aftermath of the Ames affair. There is no mention of

Commission membership or secrecy agreements in our files, and, in fact, the Commission

report was finally and properly re-reviewed by a different entity for official

declassification.

2. PRB was also asked to review the final report of the Commission on the Roles

and Capabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Commission (Brown Commission) in 1996.

Again there is no record of secrecy agreements with Board members in our files.

3. Finally and most recently, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic

Missile Threat to the United States was established in 1998, and its members signed

secrecy agreements. John Hedley, PRB Chair, spoke with the members in March,

explained pre-publication requirements and emphasized the Board's and staff's

willingness to provide guidance and prompt responses to Board members. Since that

time, four of the nine Commission members have submitted a total of 12 manuscripts for

review.

ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of

whether secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the

Board"), and offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted

diligent searches, both internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy

agreements that members of the Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful -

to date, no secrecy agreements have been found. We now intend to search selected Agency

records systems to see if there exists any reference to, or indication of, particular secrecy

agreements that the Board members may have signed. We also will attempt to locate any secrecy

agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any secrecy agreements the members

may have signed. At this point, however, the likelhood that these actions will bear fruit are not

good.

Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect

to future writings of the Board members, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified

information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board would knowingly reveal classified

information). Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever

approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the

Board's unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we

submitted to the Board. With that in mind, our options are:

ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS

Ramona,

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of whether

secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the Board"), and

offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted diligent searches, both

internally and externally (fBI, White House), to locate any secrecy agreements that members of the

Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful - to date, no secrecy agreements have

been found. We are also searching selected Agency records systems to see if there exists any reference

to, or indication of, particular secrecy agreements that the Board members may have signed. In addition,

we are attempting to locate any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any

secrecy agreements the members may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these

actions will bear fruit are not good. Moreover, this effort has been complicated by the fact that, at the

outset, the FBI was given responsibility for the security clearance process relating to the Board.

Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect to

future writings of the Board members and staffers, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified

information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board or its staff would knowingly reveal classified

information). The last meeting of the Board will take place on 23 September, and the Board will be out of

business as of 1 October. If we wish to address the Board on this issue as a group, the 23 September

meeting will be our last opportunity to do so.? Otherwise we will have to deal with each Board member and*

staffer individually, it at all. Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever

approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the Board's

unhappiness with our position concerning the final statement of compliance that we submitted to the

Board. With that in mind, our options are:

SUBJECT: JFK Board Secrecy Agreements Issue

Bruce:

The EXDIR concurs with the OGC recommended option (#5), provided that the letter is low-key and

stresses that the pre-publication review "obligation" is standard operating procedure. Additionally, he

requests the opportunity to view the letter in draft. Thanks.

(Option 5. In lieu of a security exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly

mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to

publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified

information. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this

obligation (which we would be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy

agreements). Again, we bluff the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.)
