Attached is] note on INFOSEC procedures.
It appears that the ARRB reviewers will be able to take lap-

requirement for handling classified diskettes and Classified

forms.

I propose we implement Situation #3 (board reviewers
can carry their own SECRET Laptops daily in & out of the
building). Establishing procedures for a LOG and the Form
4261 should not be a problem. We will need 2 or 3 HRG

Dear Mr, Petia: Sadun

As we previously discussed, please initiate the necessary action to grant the appropriate
SCI clearances for Carolyn Carpenter, SSN} Ms. Carpenter's file was
reviewed by the Department of Justice Personnel Security Office. The DoJ
recommended granting a Top Secret clearance and postponing a decision on SCI
pending a CIA review for special exception to _ Directive 114, paragraph 5C, due to
foreign in-laws.

As you may recall from our conversation, Ms. Carpenter is a former CIA employee. I
would like to request that the investigation for her SCI clearance be given careful
consideration. It is extremely important to the Review Board that our clearances meet
the highest standards of the agencies with which we have dealings.

The Review Board has informed Ms. Carpenter that her employment is contingent upon
receiving the appropriate clearances. Therefore, I respectfully request that her case be
given top priority. If you need further information, please contact either me or Tracy
Shycoff, our Deputy Security Officer. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

SUBJECT: H Secrecy Agreements with Commission Members

1. At your request, PRD searched its files to-find information on how secrecy
agreements have been handled vis a vis members of commissions dealing with
intelligence-related matters. There have been three instances of PRD interface with such
commissions. The fii rst was in 1994 when the Joint Security Commission requested a
PRB review on its report on Counterintelligence and Security Policies, Procedures and
Practices in the CIA in the aftermath of the Ames affair. There is no mention of
Commission membership or secrecy agreements in our files, and, in fact, the Commission
report was finally and properly re-reviewed by a different entity for official
declassification. |

2. PRB was also asked to review the final report of the Commission on the Roles
and Capabilities of the USS. Intelligence Commission (Brown Commission) in 1996.
Again there is no record of secrecy agreements with Board members in our files.

|

3. Finally and most recently, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic
Missile Threat to the United States was established in 1998, and its members signed
secrecy agreements. John Hedley, PRB Chair, spoke with the members in March,
explained pre-publication requirements and emphasized the Board’s and staff’s
willingness to provide guidance and prompt responses to Board members. Since that
time, four of the nine Commission members have submitted a total of 12 manuscripts for
review.

ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATIONS

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of
whether secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the
i Board"), and offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted
diligent searches, both internally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy
agreements that members of the Board may have signed. Those searches have been unsuccessful -
to date, no secrecy agreements have been found. We now intend to search selected Agency
y records systems to see if there exists any reference to, or indication of, particular secrecy
agreements that the Board members may have signed. We also will attempt to locate any secrecy
agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any secrecy agreements the members
may have signed. At this point, however, the likelihood that these actions will bear fruit are not
good.

Our primary goal in this situation is to preserve our prepublication review rights with respect
to future writings of the Board members, in order to prevent the inadvertent release of classified
information (since it is unlikely that any member of the Board would knowingly reveal classified
information). Before considering the options set forth below, it is worth noting that whatever ~
approach we take with the Board, we may encounter some hostility and resistance due to the

The following represents a summary of where we currently stand regarding the issue of whether
secrecy agreements were ever signed by the Assassination Records Review Board ("the Board’), and
offers options to address that issue. Thus far, CIA security officials have conducted diligent searches, both
intemally and externally (FBI, White House), to locate any secrecy agreements that members of the

we are attempting to locate any secrecy agreements the Board staff signed to see if that leads us to any

SUBJECT: ERUFK Board Secrecy Agreements Issue

Bruce:

The EXDIR concurs with the OGC recommended option (#5) , provided that the letter is low-key and
stresses that the pre-publication review “obligation” is standard operating procedure. Additionally, he
requests the opportunity to view the letter in draft. Thanks.

T
(Option 5. In lieu of a security exit briefing, send each Board member and staffer a letter which expressly
mentions that they have an obligation to submit for prepublication review any future writings they plan to
publish (related to their work as Board members or staffers) as part of their obligation to protect classified
information. This approach would make it more inconvenient for the Board to probe for the source of this
obligation (which we would be unable to produce since we have not found any signed secrecy
agreements). Again, we blutt the Board. Board members and staffers sign nothing.)
