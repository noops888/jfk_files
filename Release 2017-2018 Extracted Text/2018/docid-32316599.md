RE:

ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU

INTERNAL SECURITY • GUATEMAIA...

NEUTRALITY MATTERS

ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU, a wealthy Guatemalan National

however, on May 4, 1965, U. S. Customs Agents in Miami con-

fiscated arms which were

to be used in this attempt.

MM T-1, a Cuban exile who

has been involved in

revolutionary activities for the past five years, on June 21,

1965, advised that he had been in contact with ALEJOS and no

additional developments or significant happenings transpired

concerning ALEJOS" possible future plans against the

Guatemalan Government.

ALEJOS did indicate that he would

only need about ten Cuban exiles from the Miami area in con-

nection with his next attempt against the Guatemalan Government.

Mi T-2 has been active in Cuban revolutionary

matters for the past six years and on June 22, 1965, advised

of the following information:

GERALD PATRICK HEMMING, an Irresponsible adventurer

and soldier of fortune, on that date claimed he had been in

touch with ALEJOS and had attempted to

convince him that he,

HEMMING, should be in

charge

Of ALEJOS' military plans and

do the recruiting for ALEJOS' next attempt against Guatemala.

HEMING said he would attempt to sell ALEJOS

plans to the

Government of Guatemala and expected a representative of the

-Guatemalan Government

i to arrive in Miami in the near future.

On June 28,

1965, MN T-? stated that HElMING

not since mentioned ALEJOS

or the Guatemalan representative

it is doubtful he has had any further contact with

ALEJOS or ever met with a representative of the Guatemalan

Government.
