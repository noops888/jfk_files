GOVERNMENT

DATR 6 August 1950

1.

On 20 October 1955 the Deputy Director of Security disapproved

Subject for staff employment.

He approved, however, his continued use

on a contract basis.

The basis for this was Subject's past service as

an informant for the FBI.

"On' i August 1956 Mr. Newton, Wi Division, stated that

ployee.

¡the case of

Subject would affect the decision in the case of Mrs. Hidalgo.

Subject is

not in a covert status at this time.

At the most he is under light cover

serving as a contract employee. Mr. Newton informs me that his duties

- are performed in the Station

itself and that they are the type of duties

which are normally performed by a staff employee and would have been

performed by a staff employee in this case if it were not for I/o

limitations®

16-7

3.

Mrs. Hidalgo's relationship with the Station) would be no more

open and no more covert than Subjects.

Lo It is therefore recommended that Mr. Newton be informed that the

decision previously made in the Subject case does not automatically

disqualify Mrs. Hidalgo from contract employment.
