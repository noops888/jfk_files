History and Relative Importance

to Hoodlum Activities

The Armory Lounge is owned and operated by one CARMEN

FANELLI Of 328 Wesley, Oak Park, Illinois, a white male,

approximately 60 years of age.

He is considered a long

time

acquaintance of sAM GIANCANA,

JOSEPH AIUPPA, ANTHONY J. ACCARDO

and other hoodlums residing in the western suburbs of Chicago.

FANELLI at one time was a bookmaker and small time hoodlum, and

has been associated with the Armory Lounge for approximately

ten years.

Chicago informants have been reporting for some time

of the fact that frequent meetings of Syndicate hoodlums take

place at the Armory Lounge, which they refer to as the place 'but

west".

These meetings are presided over by GIANCANA when he is

in town, and in his absence by such lesser luminaries as WILLIAM

DADDANO, one of GIANCANA's lieutenants.

CG 6343-C* has reported

conversations between MURRAY HUMPHREYS,

FRANK FERRARO and others

wherein they have referred to meeting

"out west" on matters of

importance.

One neighborhood source, PCI GLADYS EBLE, owner

of an apartment building overlooking

the Armory reports large

gatherings of "hoodlum type" individuals congregating on occasion

at this establishment. One she positively has identified as

GIANCANA. (U)

Bureau Agents, as recently as September, 1960, entered

the Armory on pretext, noted a large dinner party in progress,

attended by, among others, ANTHONY ACCARDO and JOSEPH P. GLIMCO. (V)

Physical Description

of Building

The exterior of the Armory is of face brick,

approximately twenty-four feet in width and sixty feet in

length (deep). It is located on the intersection of a one way

street and the nearest building is a three story apartment

building located approximately

sixty feet west of the Armory.

The space between the Armory and the apartment building is

taken up with an asphalt parking area suitable for about forty

vehicles.

An alley runs east and west immediately to the rear

of the Armory, and is occupied by residential, one family homes. (V)

The interior of the Armory is divided into three

sections; bar, dining area,

and private dining room, the latter

being located

to the rear of the establishment.

The

dining

area is relatively small, having accommodations for no more

than thirty persons. It contains six tables. The private

dining area is a room approximately fourteen by eighteen feet,

containing two tables,

and is separated from the main dining room by

an accordian type door. (U)

Entrance to the building is gained either through the

front (facing Roosevelt Road), or into the main dining room

via an entrance way through the parking area. This entrance

is protected by a canopy, and requires gaining access through

two doors.

There is a small (4 X 6') enclosed area between

the first and second doors.

An additional exit is located to

the rear of the building

not used, and is barred. Wif the main dining room. This exit is

On 10/3/60, a physical surveillance of the Armory

Lounge was conducted between the hours of 12:01 A.M. and 7:00 A.M.

in order to ascertain the degree of traffic and possibilities

of being observed in the event special coverage was attempted.

This surveillance revealed that there is considerable truck

traffic on West Roosevelt Road (U. S. 30) in the early morning

hours and it was also noted that a Forest Park, Illinois squad

car passes the lounge

at a very slow speed approximately every

fifteen minutes.

The Forest Park Police Force is commanded by

JOHN CORTINO, who has cooperated with the Bureau in the past,

however, he has been observed by Pet ible in the Armory Lounge

on numerous occasions and a remote possibility exists that there

may be some association between the owner of the Armory Lounge

and Chief CORTINO, so that any contact with the Chief with

relation to the Armory Lounge is not going to be attempted. (V›

Investigation to date has revealed that the only

possessor of a key to this building is the owner CARMEN FANELLI.

Investigation has further revealed that an elderly Italian

caretaker, described by PCI EBLE as a relative of FANELLI, opens

the Armory Lounge at approximately 9:00 A.M. and proceeds to

the Armory by foot, which indicates that he resides within a few

blocks of the establishment. (U)

In view of the location of this establishment close

to heavy traffic and due to the fact that there is no cover

or concealment to individuals attempting to penetrate it, it

is not felt that it would be feasible at this time to attempt

any such penetration even though a coverage at this place would

top hoodlum

Attempts will be made to explore the possibilities

of obtaining a key which would permit immediate access to this

building and if such is met with success the Bureau will be

immediately advised as to the feasibility then of attempted

coverage. (u
