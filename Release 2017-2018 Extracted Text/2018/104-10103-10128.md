said that in the event of a riot at the Unlversity, they would be crushed by the

communists and militia, already voll trained, equipped and organized.

Around the fifteenths of September, Brand thought he had noticed certain unu

things around Potin's building, where Brand's safehouse was located. One day, a

Through Cabanas and Benito Fernandez, Brand met a man named Oscar Rodriguez.
