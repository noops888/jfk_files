VI..

Origin of the Interest of la Rocca in Racketeering

and Steps Leading to Current Position and Actlvitles

in Racketeering Natters

GEORGE MESSER, who has been engaged in numbers writing

activity since about 1928, was once depended upon by

Pittsburgh racketeers for protection purposes because he,

knew local and state police figures.

LA ROCCA was one of

the individuals who utilized MeSSER In this regard.

He

became acquainted with IA ROCCA In about 1941 or 1942 when

LA ROCCA was handling all the numbers activity in the East

Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself up as a

"Ilttle god."

When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied with his

finandal gains, he left Pittsburgh on a

trip to chicago to

see friends about paste reel machines with which he felt.

he could make more money.

A paste reel was similar to a

"one-armed bandit" with the exception that a small paper-

wrapped mint was dispensed as the coin was placed In the

slot and the play was registered.

While LA ROCCA was in 'Chicago, MESSER moved into the East

Liberty section and took over

the entire numbers. operation.

When LA ROCCA returned to Pittsburgh he became angry with

MESSER and had someone drive a car over him one night s

he was crossing a street.

Because he thought he would make

money in the East Llberty

section,

MESSER stayed in the

business of writing numbers and actually forced LA ROCCA

out of this business.

In about 1943 MESSER and LA RCCCA became friendly and

LA ROCCA invited MESSER to share equally with him in the

ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which

later set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard In Pittsburgh.

LA ROCCA managed to raise enough money to put up his share

for the business and MESSER personally traveled to Chicago

to arrange for the purchase of machines to be distributed

by this company.

These machines were placed throughout the

East Liberty, Homewood, and Garfield sections of Pittsburgh

and were heavily taxed by both the Government and the City

of Pittsburgh.

Other owners of the afore-mentioned company,

in addition to MESSER and IA ROCCA were FRANK AMATO,

BARNEY. MC GINLEY, SAMUEL MANNARINO, and F. W. 200G.

business.

Although each of the afore-mentioned individuals

owned an equal share in the company, SAMUEL MANNARING and

LA ROCCA obviously usurped the most authority and held

meetings at which important subjects were discussed in Italian,

LA ROCCA used MESSER only

as he got his cut of the profits:

to all intents and purposes a leader in this type of operation.

SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA came into the area from the James-

town, New York, vicinity where he had been engaged in

moonshining operations bringing him into' Pittsburgh on a scheduled

He remained in Pittsburgh because his criminal activities
