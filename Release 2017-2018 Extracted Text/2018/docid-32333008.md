VI. Origin of the Interest of La Rocca: in Racketeering :

and Steps Leading to Current Position and Activities
‘in Racketeering Matters

GEORGE MESSER, who has been engaged in numbers writing
activity since about 1928, was once depended upon by
Pittsburgh racketeers for protection purposes becduse he
knew local and state police figures. LA ROCCA was one of
the individuals who utilized MESSER in this regard. He
became acquainted with LA ROCCA in about 1941 or; 1942 when
LA ROCCA was handling all the-numbers activity in the East
Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself up as a
“little god," When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied with his
financal gains, he left Pittsburgh on a trip to Chicago to
énds about paste reel machines with which hé felt
he *could:imake more money. A paste reel was similar to a
"@ne-armed bandit" with the exception that a small paper-
wrapped mint was dispensed as the coin was placed in the
slot and the play was registered.

While LA ROCCA was in'Chicago, MESSER moved into the East

Liberty section and took over the entire mumbérs. operation.
When -LA ROCCA returned to Pittsburgh he became angry with
MESSER and had’ someone drive a car over him one night as

he was crossing a street. Because he thought he would make
money in the East Liberty section, MESSER stayed in the:
business of writing numbers and actually forced LA ROCCA
out of this business.

In.about 1943:MESSER and LA RCCCA became friendly and

LA ROCCA invited MESSER to share equally with him in the
ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing Company which
later set up offices at 5746 Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh.
LA ROCCA managed to raise enough money to put up his share
for the business and MESSER personally traveled. to Chicago
to arrange for the purchase of machines to be. distributed
by this company. These machines were placed throughout the
East Liberty, Homewood, and Garfield sections of'' Pittsburgh
and were heavily taxed by both the Government and the city
of Pittsburgh. Other owners of the afore-mentioned company,
in addition to MESSER and LA ROCCA were FRANK AMATO,
BARNEY.MC GINLEY, SAMUEL MANNARINO, and. F, W. ZO0GG,°

. t

The afore-mentioned company was doing well financially before : a
‘Allegheny County, Pa., authorities raided establishments where i
the machines had been‘:placed and forced the company out of

business. Although each of the afore-mentioned individuals ‘
owned an equal share in the company, SAMUEL MANNARINO and

LA ROCCA obviously usurped the most authority and held

meetings at which important’ subjects were discussed in Italian,

which MESSER did not understand, LA ROCCA used MESSER only - i
' for proven protection méthods and MESSER did not mind as long f
as he got. his cut-of the profits, - MIKE GENOVESE, who was. !
turned over to MESSER by LA ROCCA "to keep him clean" because : ie
LA:ROCCA had ‘him in mind for fubutte plans, FRANK VALENTI, ;
and ANTONIO RIPEPI visited the offices of the Goin Machine :
Distributing Company regularly and took orders from MANNARINO ;
