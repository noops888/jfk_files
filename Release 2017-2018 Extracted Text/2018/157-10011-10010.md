OCCURRENCE: The Special Group heard Mr. Merchant state his opinion that the only

solution is to move the Guatemalan train activities to the United States even though

the U. S. could probably not get away with this either. A number of alternative

Since then, the Cubans have received sizeable amounts of bloc arms and have or-

ganized a malitia. Mr. Gray wondered how a few hundred exiles could be."

"Mr. Mann expressed the opinion that the way to proceed is to seal Cuba off from

the rest of Latin America and settle down for a one- or

OCCURRENCE: President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in

Mexico.

It tulfilled U.s. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the

United States and the West.

State believes this should ease the way for future discussions

about Cuba with the Mexicans.

Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by

President Kennedy and President Lopez Mateos included a phrase which was

'They proposed

to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention

may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of

peoples." In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that "There

were no developments resulting from the President's trip to Mexico including the text

of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter the basic guidelines which govern

the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now had 45 Asians in Havana operating.

In addition there are agents and teams in the provinces.

"Voice of Cuba" broadcasts from

the U.S. Navy submarine were successful.

"It is noted that UPI carried this news item
