Dear Jim,

Maurice DEJEAN...

It has recently come to our notice that DEJEAN's

secretary when he was in Moscow was a certain Christine

DAVIRON, who in 1963 in Moscow married an American journalist

described as BuaVKORENGOLD currently Newsweek correspondent

in London.

KORENGOLD appears to be identical with R.J. KORENGOLD

who was in Moscow for Newsweek from 1952 probably until

We have not traced him

and the

only other trace we have of him is an article he wrote

:

context.

The KORENGOLDs are knowl to a member of the FCO who was

in Moscow with them.

This official says he has never

noticed that

she was biaised either for or against the Soviet

system.

He describes her as coming from a rather strait-

laced military family.

She is aged about 30, intelligent

and attractive.

4.

We have not told the French about this but would be

quite happy for you to discuss it with them.

Yours sincerely,

RETURN TO CIA
