Defection Program

‘1. When I phoned COBB this AM, she informed me that she had heard over
tho radio last night that Iwis BUCH and two other functionaries had arrived
‘in Key West, and that a great emotional scene had ensued. The broadcast.
also indicated tht BUCH had been working with the underground.

2. Ihave informed both FI and PROP. Dave Phillips was interested since
he had been told by some “high authority” in WAVE not to redease anything
on the defection at this time. He.also said that they knew the identities
of the "2 other functionaries" but hadn't released the names.

3. The broadcast wes called:

Tribuna Democraticia (Spanish language program)
le Yor!

2200 hours
