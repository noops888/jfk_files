Assistant General Counsel

Litigation Division, OGC

DCI SOUICES

and Methods Authority With Respect

to JFK Assassination Records

1.

Per your request, I have attached a copy of the

President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992

(ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-3458, reprirted at

44 U.S.C. §

2107 note.

For your convenience, I have higrlighted

the pertinent provisions that

will aid in responding to an

inquiry regarding the statute's effect on the DCI's statutory

authority to protect intelligence sources and methods.

2. The clear language and intent of the law is to supersede

staiutes that prohibit disclosure of information, except for some

irrelevant subject areas, such as tax records.

The statute

provides that "it shall take precedence over

any other law

(except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code), judicial

decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would

otherwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the

ACt.

ARCA § 11(a).

This language, taken with the provisions

discussed below

which limit the intelligence sources and methods

that may be protected and set a strict procedural scheme by which

information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively

supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect

to intelligence sources and methods information subject to the

ARCA.

3. Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the

release of information may be "postponed."

The statute

contemplates that all information will eventually be released.

Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available

to the public no later than 25 years after the passage of the

ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president

certifies that continued postponement is necessary.

ARCA

§ 4(g) (2) (D).

With respect to intelligence-related information,

ARCA allows

postponement if:

"(1) the threat to ... intelligence operations ... is

of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and

such public disclosure would reveal..

SUBJECT: DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect to JFK

Assassination Records

(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently

requires

protection;

(B) an intelligence source or method which is

currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be

utilized, by the United States Government and which has

not been officially disclosed, the disclosure of which

would interfere with the conduct of intelligence

activities; or

(C) any other matter currently relating to

intelligence operations

.. the disclosure of which

would demonstrably impair the natioral security of the

United States."

ARCA § 6(1) (Emphasis added.)

4.

The originating agency is to make the first review to

ider-ify information that meets the standards for postponement.

ARCA § 4(C) (2) (D) (i1).

For CIA, this effort is being undertaken

by the Historical Review Group, in consultation with the

Directorate of Operations and other appropriaie Agency

components.

Information the originating agencies identify for

postponement must be transmitted to the Review Board. ARCA

§ 4 (c) (2) (E).

The Review Board "shall consider and render

decisions on a determination by a Government office to seek to

postpone the disclosure of assassination records."

ARCA S

7 (i) (1). Specifically, the "Review Board shall consider and

render decisions on

whether an assassination record or

particular information in

a record qualifies

for postponement of

disclosure under the Act." ARCA § 7(i) (2) (B).

5. If the Review Board determines to order the disclosure

of information that the originating agency felt met the criteria

for postponement, it "shall notify the head of the originating

body of its determination and publish a copy of the determination

in the Federal Register within 14 days after the determination is

made."

ARCA § 9(c) (4) (A). If the information contained in an

assassination record is "obtained or developed solely within the

... the information under the standards set forth in

Section 6."

ARCA § 9 (d) (1) (emphasis added). The President's

decision must be certified to the Review Board within 30 days of

aDe certified too

• President must be re-reviewed every 5 years. ARCA § 9 (d) (2) .

Dear John:

A few months ago we made a request to the Department of Defense for, inter alia,

"Any available MOUs or MOAs defining command responsibilities and

lines of authority, responsibility and accountability when individuals of

the Central Intelligence Agency serve under 'military cover, i.e., are

employed and operate for the CIA while wearing the uniform of the

armed services: (Applicable period of interest here is 1956-64.)"

This letter is our official notification to you that we have made the above stated request.

We understand that the Agency was advised of this request by the Department of

Defense at the time the request was made. We do, however, apologize for our

inadvertent error in not having provided you with a contemporaneous notification.

Sincerely,

Lion

Dear Director Tenet:

In accordance with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act

documents and the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause

harm to the United States or to any individual.

your representative to the Review Board to examine our copies of the documents for

which determinations have been made and to discuss the determinations with my staff.

Assassination Records Review Board

Review Guidelines

for Information Relating to Official Cover

This document sets forth the review guidelines for use by the Assassination Records Review Board

("Board" or "ARRB") and the Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA" or "Agency") for public release of

certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and specific mechanisms of official cover

(hereafter "official cover details"). These guidelines have been officially adopted by the Board to serve the

public interest in making the complete story of the JFK assassination available while protecting from

official disclosure information which would be harmful to the national security and is properly classified

under Executive Order 12958.

1. Information in documents originated by the Congress (most often in the context of personal

statements to committees or committee staffs) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively

released unless it sets forth specific information not generally known to the public or the Agency shall be

able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative action to prevent the disclosure of such information in the

past and that release here would cause identifiable damage to the national security.

2. Information in documents originated by the Executive Branch (including those designated by the

parties as quasi-executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the records of the Executive

Branch) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it

concerns.

identification of the official cover provider,

specific locations used for official cover, and

identity, scope, details and mechanisms of any particular official cover.

3. Information in such documents which the Executive Branch has taken an affirmative act to

officially disclose or allow to be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable.

4. Moreover, information in such documents which relates to individuals who are considered

important to the story of the assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered for release on

an individual basis with the Agency having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national security.

5. For any information postponed pursuant to these Guidelines, the Agency agrees to provide a

summary or substitution which preserves the content and relevance of the postponed information

Neither these guidelines nor the release of documents pursuant to these guidelines shall be deemed

to constitute an official Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details, and specific

mechanisms of official cover in other information disclosure law matters.

Dear Mr. Gunn:

Re: Release or Postponement of "Official Cover" Information

This letter is intended to confirm our understanding of the

recent "review guidelines" promulgated by the Assassination

Records

Review Board ("Board" or "ARRB") for public release of

certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and

specific mechanisms of official cover (hereafter "official cover

details"). This understanding is based on the prefatory

negotiations between our respective staffs and reflects the

agreement of all concerned agencies and departments within the

Executive Branch. Please note that we have included a classified

addendum which presents examples of

some of the following

understandings.

1. It is the intent of the staff of the Board and the

federal agencies that these guidelines should serve the public

interest by making the complete story of the JFK assassination

available while protecting from official disclosure information

which would be harmful to the national security and is properly

classified under Executive Order 12958.

2.

Information in documents originated by the Congress

(most often in the context of personal statements to committees

or committee

staffs) which sets forth official cover details

shall be presumptively released unless it sets forth specific

information not generally known to the public or the Executive

Branch is able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative

action to prevent the disclosure of similar or identical

information in another context in the past and that release here

would cause identifiable damage to the national security.

3. Information in documents originated by the Executive

Branch (including those designated by the parties as quasi-

executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the

records of the Executive Branch) which sets forth official cover

details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that

it

concerns:

• identity or identification of the official cover

provider,

• specific locations used for official cover, and

• scope, details and mechanisms of any particular

official cover.

4 .

Information in such documents which the Executive Branch

has taken an affirmative act to officially disclose or allow to

be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable; however, in no

event shall extrinsic evidence by inference or deductive

reasoning be deemed to qualify for this provision.

5.

Further, information in such documents which relates

to

individuals who are considered important to the story of the

assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered

for release on an individual basis with the Executive Branch

having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national

security.

6. For any information postponed pursuant to the review

guidelines, the concerned Executive Branch agency or department

agrees to provide an unclassifild summary or substitution which

preserves the general content and

relevance of the postponed

information.

Dear Mr. Talbott:

I am writing in response to your December 17, 1997 security-classified letter to

Assassination Records Review Board Chairman John R. Tunheim. Inasmuch as the

Executive Director is the statutorily designated liaison of the Review Board to Federal

agencies, I am taking the liberty of responding to you directly:

Your letter identified State Department interests in several records that are scheduled

for an upcoming Review Board meeting. Although the Review Board is well aware of

the general interest that you describe in your letter, the Board has not received evidence (or

argument) from the State Department regarding the particular records at issue. Even if the

Board were to agree with the general propositions stated in your letter, it is not clear

that the opening of the documents at issue would release any information that is not

already effectively in the public domain.

The Review Board strongly urges the Department of State to provide evidence that is

specific to the documents at issue. I would be pleased to make arrangements for your

designated representative to review the specific records so that he or she might provide

evidence that would assist the Review Board in its decisions.
