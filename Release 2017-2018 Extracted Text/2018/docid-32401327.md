DAILY SUMMARY

9 December 1963

This summary of significant information has not been coordinated

outside the Office of Current Intelligence. It does not representa

complete coverage of all current reports received, nor does time

permit the complete evaluation of all reports which are included.

CONTENTS

MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS:

Three independent clandestine sources have reported on

the unloading of military equipment from the Soviet vessel

METALLURG BAIKOV in Havana harbor on 19 or 20 November.

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

In a 6-7 December speech devoted mainly to education, Cas-

tro digressed to discuss the situation resulting

from Vene-

zuela's charge that the arms cache discovered on

a Vene-

zuelan beach

last month had come from Cuba.

Castro implied

that the arms had been planted by CIA and are being used

as a pretext for new action by the "imperialists and their

lackeys" against Cuba.

He expressed confidence that what-

ever the result, the Cuban revolution will not be defeated.

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

Faure Chomon Mediavilla is replacing Omar Fernandez as

transportation minister; Major Jesus Montane Oropesa will

be new communications minister. (Page 3)

Heavy rainfall has apparently caused damages to military

facilities in Pinar del Rio Province and hampered travel

in Oriente Province. (Page 4)

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Fidel Castro's speech of the night of 6-7 December was

on the occasion of the graduation of women

teachers for the

literacy campaign.

He devoted most of the 99 minutes to a

discussion of the development of local education in Cuba. At

one point, however, he made a moderately long digression to

discuss Venezuela and the situation raised by Venezuela's dis-

covery last month of a large cache

of weapons, some of which

have been traced to Cuba.

castro stated that,

while "the imperialists and their

lackeys" charge that Cuba is promoting subversion in Vene-

zuela, rebellion and subversion cannot be promoted from with-

The Venezuelan revolution, he maintained, stems from

the Venezuelan people's own disgust with their government and

with its permitting the "imperialists" to plunder Venezuela's

wealth and resources.

If subversion could, in fact, be promoted

from the outside, why, he asked, have all

the resources of im

perialism failed

to subvert the

Cuban Government?

Betancourt,

"that miserable lackey," is trying to incite

the United States to take military action against Cuba, Castro

charged.

As a pretext the Venezuelans say they have discovered

arms from Cuba on the Venezuelan coast, Castro stated. "Some

of the arms," he said,

"are said to have borne an effaced Cuban

seal, and other arms are said to be bazookas, recoilless cannon,

mortars.

But Cuban mortars perchance? No! Yankee mortars!

Yankee bazookas! Yankee recoilless cannon! Arms which we did

not manufacture; arms which we did not buy!" Castro then went

on, without specifically denying that the weapons had come from

Cuba, by implying that the CIA had obtained Cuban arms from

Cuban deserters and that it would not be difficult to plant

to the Belgian-made light rifles and submachineguns which have

been identified as among those shipped to Cuba in 1959 and

1960.) With respect to the US-made mortars, bazookas, and re-

' the OAS investigating com-

Castro then attempted to show the "brazenness" and in-

consistency of those who would use the Venezuelan arms cache

as a pretext to invade or to blockade Cuba when for more than

four years the very same kind of subversive activity as is

now being charged to Cuba has been perpetrated against Cuba--

without any hemispheric attempt to punish the aggressors.

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH - cont'd

"Things have changed quite a bit," Castro declared, "to

attack or to blockade Cuba now would not be easy; we can de-

fend ourselves; we are calm; we know what we have to defend

ourselves with." Then, in an implied reference to the Soviet

"When we hear some of these lackeys of imperialisn

talking so calmly about invading Cuba, when it has been only

one year since the October crisis, they are once more proving

us right and are once more justifying Cuba's taking defensive

measures; this talk led to the October crisis." Castro then

declared that "these men are so deceived by their own propaganda

that...they cannot conceive of what any invader would meet here."

A war against Cuba, he said, "would not end while there was a

single mercenary soldier treading on our soil."

Castro then returned briefly to his views as to how peace

can be assured

in the Caribbean.

"Whatever they want to dis-

cuss with Cuba," he said, "let them come and discuss honestly

with Cuba; because we have stated the indispensable prerequisites

for a peaceful atmosphere...in the Caribbean." Thus

far, how-

ever,

"they have answered with aggressions on top of aggressions."

This course, he said, "is doomed to failure." (CIA FBIS Havana,

Montane took part in the attack on the Moncada Barracks

in 1953 and followed. Castro to exile in Mexico.

He took part

in the GRANMA expedition of 1956 when he was captured and

im-

prisoned. After the revolution, he reportedly received only

a minor post in the government because he had talked too much

in prison.

His most recent post, dating from at least August

1962,

has been as number two man

in the Tourism Institute

(INIT). He is said to be an ardent Marxist-Leninist, who

preaches it at every opportunity. (UPI 63, 6 December, UN-

Intercepted Cuban military messages of 7 December indicate

that serious rain damage has occurred in both Pinar del Rio

and Oriente provinces.

Pinar del Rio reported the extent of damage to their defensive

fortifications and facilities in messages to the operations

officer, apparently at fourth army headquarters in Pinar del

Rio.

More than half the trenches had been destroyed, the

shelters and command posts at most of the units reporting

had suffered serious damage, and division headquarters reported

that, while its facilities were still in good condition; the

roads leading to it will have to be repaired. Meanwhile, in

Sriente Province, intercepts indicate that torrential rainfall

had caused the rivers to flood making travel difficult and

had forced the closing of the Baracoa airport.

A trained clandestine source who is a civil aviation

expert with the Cuban Ministry of Transportation reports that

several minor incidents of sabotage have been discovered on

CUBANA aircraft.

On 15 November a CUBANA IL-14 made a

round-trip flight from Rancho Boyeros Airport to Nueva Gerona

without a storage battery.

The source comments that serious

trouble would have resulted if one engine had stopped or had

been feathered while en route.

This incident may be related

to various acts of subtle sabotage against CUBANA aircraft,

such as stuffing exhaust tubes with rags or obstructing car-

buretor intakes.

In addition, the source reports that a CUBANA Britannia

aircraft was sabotaged by Algerian personnel during a recent

flight to Algiers.

The bydraulic line was fractured forcing

the crew to use manual controls to lower the landing gear for

a stop in Madrid.

CUBAN AIR FLIGHT CONNECTIONS:

Spain has

approved regularly scheduled Havana-Madrid flights

by CUBANA airlines, according to an intercepted message of 7 De-

cember. It was previously reported that the Spanish Government

was unwilling to reduce these flights because it believes the

connections are vital to Spain; however, the Foreign Ministry

said it would limit CUBANA flights to Havana-Madrid-Havana with-

out stops in Algiers or Prague, and would refuse landing to

Soviet-built CUBANA aircraft.

(See Daily Summary of 18 November.)

It has also been reported that CUBANA is assured of capacity

passenger loads for the Havana-Madrid service and plans. to pool

air freight from all of Western Europe for delivery to Havana

via Madrid; thus assuring full payloads both ways. (See Daily

SHIPPING SUPPORT FOR CUBA:

Argentina is reportedly attempting to stop one of its ships--

the SS ANAMAR--from delivering a cargo of coffee to Cuba, despite

the fact that there are currntly no legal restrictions against

Argentine ships calling anywhere in the world. The ANAMAR left

Brazil on l November with a cargo of Brazilian coffee, purchased

by the

USSR and destined for Cuba.

(See Daily Summary of 8 No-

vember.) The Argentine Foreign Ministry informed US Embassy of-

ficials that it was determined to prevent the ANAMAR from going

to Cuba because of potential unfavorable press reaction. Argen-

tina wants to avoid legal and financial entanglements in the mat-

ter; however, it is determined to stop the ship and

is reportedly

even considering some type of provocation which would force the

Ship to put into Puerto Rico. The owners of the ANAMAR are

equally adamant that the ship will not go to Cuba; reportedly

they had agreed to ship coffee from Brazil to some Central Amer-

ican country to pay some back bills, and were only informed later

that the shipment would go to Cuba.

According to the owners, the

Ship is now lying off the coast of Brazil awaiting resolution

of the problem.

The owners reportedly stated they will sink the

ship rather than go to Cuba.

using à highly technical process, were

able to raise the serial

to those of weapons known to have been delivered to Cuba from

Belgium in 1959 and 1960.

Similarly, in the case of the 81

case,

one-fourth inch of molten brazing alloy had been used

to cover the places where the numbers had been ground off and

it was not possible to restore the numbers.

However, Venezuelan

Nation claims that a resumption of formal diplomatic relations

is imminent, according to the US Embassy in Rabat (see Daily

Summary for

29 November and 6. December). According to a semi-

official account of the meeting, which took place on 4 December,

the Cubans reasserted their desire to normalize relations and

professed a lack of hostile intentions against the Moroccan

Government--which severed formal relations after Cuban "techni-

cians" arrived in Algeria on 22 October.

"Informed sources"

in Rabat claim

that the government is considering the Cuban

demarche with "attention." The Nation explains that the Cubans

now recognize that Morocco has not been the aggressor in the

Algerian conflict and that they are "repentant" over their pre-

cipitous action in aiding Ben Bella. (Am Emb Rabat, 866, 6 De-

CUBAN SUPPORT OF EXTERNAL SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY:

The

informed his govern-

ment, in an intercepted 2 December message, that he is con-

vinced of the accuracy of the Venezuelan Government's charges

of Cuban subversion in Venezuela. He pointed out that the

heavy voting in Venezuela's 1 December national electión dem-

onstrates that the legal opposition in Venezuela is not impli-

cated in the violence and terrorism.

He also stated that the

Castro regime is so thoroughly repudiated by Venezuelan pub-

lic opinion that the Venezuelan Government has no need to use

artificial means to stimulate anti-Castro feeling there.

The

ambassador pointed out that many Venezuelan Communists

are in Cuba and from there "they permanently incite rebellion"

in Venezuela and Cuban propaganda supports their efforts.

There is additional information on Cuban use of a DC-4

aircraft allegedly to supply Venezuelan guerrillas with weapons

through British Guiana.

A clandestine source who is a civil

aviation

expert and affiliated with the Cuban Ministry of Trans-

portation reports hearing rumors to the effect that the recently

refurbished CUBANA DC-4 with CUBANA registry number CUT-785 bas

been issued a "Guiana license," presumably a license for operation

in British Guiana, and has been operated by military personnel.

He adds that

"it is said that clandestine flights have been made

to Venezuela."

The same source had previously reported the re-

furbishing of this plane and some others and indicated that extra

fuel tanks had been installed on them.
