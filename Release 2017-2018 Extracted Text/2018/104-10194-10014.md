Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Cverseas Sccurity

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from lApril

1971 to 31 March 19720

The rating period covers the third full

year that Mr. O'Connell has served as the Deputy Director of

Sceurity for Physical, 'l'echnical and Overseas security.

2. • The dircelorate which Mr. O'Connoll supervises is

geographically widely separated in the Headquarters arca. This

separation adds complexitics to the lask of supervising the

directorate and coordinating the activities uf three Divisions,

operating over a biond spectrum of activitids and responsibilities.

During the sporting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell'e

directorate look or on important, added responsibility- the security

of automatic data processing.

This function covers the completity

of maintaining securil; in a rapidly expaning activity replete with

serious security problems because of the severe compaction of

information resultiny from rapid advances ind accoptability of

technology in the fiold of data handling. The achievements of the

Physical Sccurity Division, the Technical Division, and the Over-

seas Security Support Division roguire a high degrec of coordina-

tion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental lo a unified

security policy.

3. In sgite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotcly

located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieved

effective supervision. The Divisions moved forward in an

Mr. James V. O'Concil

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

1. This is a narrative Fitics: Report which covers the

period from 1 April 1970 through 31 March 1971.

2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served

as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and

Overseas Secarily. The ratine period covers his second full year

ir that position.

The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has

gained added importance and increased attention during the year.

It encompasses an arca of activily which is vitally important to

the Offico oí Secury and the Agency as a whole. Mr. O'Connell

has giren codorable attention to offorts which decrease our

vulncrability it the hands of forcign opposition as well as from

domestic efforts resulting from national urrest. Mi. O'Connell

has shown improvement in the over all coordination of his respon

sibilities throughout the current eating period. He supervises his

people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to

simplify their solutions.

3. During the previous rating period,

Mr. O'Connell's

features.

COTHEY SEC-SS

I... This Fitness Réport covers the period from 1-April 1968"-

through 31 March 1969.

2. Mr. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Securit;

for Physical, Technical and Overseas Sccurity in August 1968 and

this Rating covers his performance during this period as well is

his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to 1 dugust

1968.

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Fliysical,

Technical and Overseas Security,

is responsible for the super:ision

of three large and complex divisions of this Office, In addition,

he is responsible for providing policy and technical guidance to

our Area Security Officers assigned to other components of the

Agency and in the field.

Upon assuming his duties. in August 1?n8,

Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of

these varied and complex activities.

He is ar alert and intelligent

supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several sigiti-

cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate

which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall

efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate.

Recently, he sas

effective supervisor. He brings to the performance of his duties

broad knowledge and esperience of security procedures and practicea.

He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary

Nir. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to

express himself well in both written and oral form.

His carerr

is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level per-

formances. He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior

Security executive.

However, I feel that he has not as yei applied

all of these qualities to sheir maximum potential in his performance

as.DD/PTOS. Mr. O'Connoll has one Division Chici who is evira-

ordinarily capable and exective in producing results.

Consersely,

however, he presents one dê the most difficult supervisors problems

in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't

feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that

he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. i

am consinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and

is working hard to achiere the proper supervisory balance. I rate

his performance, on balance, as STRONG with many outstanding features.

I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and

excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office ind the

Agency.

Chief, Executive Staff

1. Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of

this Office from 1 April 1967 to 31 Murch 1968, the rating period

covered by this Fitness Report.

2.

Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration

and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the

functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective

in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic

security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed

diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper

that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been

meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving

this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective

in arranging priority action in meeting short deadlines. As the

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence

received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in

applying his knowledgé of the basic organization of the Office to thi

assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior

executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive

experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and

overscas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance.

ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing

responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance

in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive

for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of

his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,

that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his

enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performaner for

the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due

to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more

measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiast: and

initiative, Nonetheless I would like to sec Mr. O'Connell strive

for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

geographically widely separated in the Headquarterg area.

This

separation adds complexities to the task of supervising the

directorate and coordinating the activities of three Divisions,

operating over a broad spectrum of activities and responsibilities.

During the reporting period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's

directorate took on an important,

added responsibility-the security

of automatic data processing.

This function covers the complexity

of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with

serious security problems because of the severe compaction of

information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability ni

technology in the field of data handling:

The achievements of the

Physical Security Division, the Technicai Division, and the Over-

seas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordina-

tion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified

security policy.

3. In spite.of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely

located from his office, Mr. O'Connell has applied and achieird

effective supervision

The Divisions moved forward in an

careerists to those positions.

Mr. James P. O'Connell

Deputy Director of Security for

Physical, Technical and Overseas Security

This is a narrative Fitness Report which covers the

period from l April 1970 through 31 March 1971.

2. During this entire period, Mr. O'Connell has served

as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and

Overseas Security.

The rating period covers his second full year

in that position. The Directorate which Mr. O'Connell heads has

gained added importance and increased attention during the year.

It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to

the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole. Mr. O'Connell

has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our

vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from

domestic efforts resulting from national unrest. Mr. O'Connell

has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his respon-

sibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his

people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to

simplify their solutions.

. 3.. During the previous

rating period, Mr. O'Connell's

performance was considered to be STRONG with several outstanding

features. During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient

addition to the outstanding areas of his performance to raise his

over-all rating to OUTSTANDING.

well, both in oral and written form.. I evaluate Mr. O'Connell's

performance over the pait year as STRONG with several outstanding

features. I have confidence in his judgment and ability and consider

him a valuable career asset of this Office. His has been a difficult

task in that as well as assuming new and additional functions, he

has been burdened with the supervision of one Division Chief who

has proven to be extremely difficult to handle over the years.

fairness to Mr. O'Connell, I should add that no one in this Office

has been particularly effective in supervising this individual who

is now slated for carly retirement. I believe that with this individ-

ual's departure Mr. O'Connell should be able to achieve a more

coherent integration of his Directorate's functions in the interest

of further efficiency and effectiveness.

1.

This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1968

through 31 March 1969:

2. Mi. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security

for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security in August 1968 and

this Rating covers his performance during this period as well as

his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to l August

1968.

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,

Technical and Overseas Security, is responsible for the supervision

of three large and complex divisions of this Office. In addition,

he is responsible for providing

policy and technical guidance to

our Area Security Officers assigned io other components of the

Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1963,

Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of

these varied and complex activities.

He is an alert and intelligent

supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several signifi-

cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate

which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall

efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was

instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division

made necessary by the dissolution of this Office's regional security

staff

He is an astute manager and an

effective supervisor.

He brings to the performance of his duties

broad knowledge and experience of security procedures and practices.

He has been most effective in keeping a close rein on budgetary

obligations within his Directorate.

4. Mr. O'Connell is personable and articulate and is able to

express himself well in both written and oral form. His career

is marked by steady advancement and consistently high level per-

formances.

He possesses all of the requisite qualities of a senior.

Security executive.

However, Ifeel that he has not as yet applied

all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his performance

as DD/ PTOS:

Mr. O'Connell has one Division Chief who is extra-

ordinarily capable and effective in producing results. Conversely,

however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems

in the Office because of certain personal characteristics. I don't

feel, and I believe that Mr. O'Connell would agree with me, that

he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. I

am convinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and

is working hard to achieve the proper supervisory balance. I rate

his performance, on balance,

as STRONG with many outstanding features.

I have complete confidence in Mr. O'Connell's ability, judgment and

excellent potential. He is a valued career asset to this Office and the

Agency.

Chief, Executive Staff

1.

Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of

this Office from I April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period

covered by this Fitness Report.

2.

Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration

and direction.of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the

functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective

in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic

security policies and procedures.

In addition, he has performed

diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper

that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been

meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving

this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective.

in arranging priority action in mecting short deadlines.

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence

reccived by this Office for action, he has been very effective in

applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the

assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior

executive who writes particularly well.

He has had extensive

experience as a Security carcerist, both in Headquarters and

overseas,

and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance-

ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing

responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance

in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive

for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the lightof

his consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,

that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his

enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for

the first six months in this position. It is possible that this is due

to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more

measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and

initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive

for a better balance in these essential performance characteristica

"lound the seminar extremely informative and worthwhile from the atandpoint

of examining the historical progression of the ADP from several points of view. All

the spoakers were highty guallfled in their particular fleld and their presentations were

well prepared. All were exceptionally apt in felding queatione.

Mr. Bert Engelhardt, Associate Director, ADP Management Center, CSC, was

agracious.host.and.-handled.his.role.as.moderator.in.a truly.profesalonal.manner.

He

has an engaging, friendly personality and is effectively articulate.

If I were to single

out any weaknees it would be Mr. Engelhardt's lecture.: He spoke on the Systeme

Analyst. In lila presentation he seemed not to take into consideration the professlonal

level of the group and devoted an inordinate amount of time on basic managerial

precepts.. This seemed to have an irritating effect on the participants who by virtue

of their positions had considerable experience in the management field.

Overall I would say, notwithetanding the above observation, It is an Interesting

for this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to

demonstrate his executive talents in this position.

3.

Although the period for which he is being rated in this position

is too short to be characterized definitively or finally, I would say that

(Fitness Report)

This is an Annual Fitness Report on the above employee

for the period ending 31 March 1966. Mr. O'Connell is currently

assigned as Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS), a position

he assumed in Seplember 1965. He was promoted to GS-16 at the

time he assumed these responsibilities on the basis of a long per-

iod of distinguished service that was culminated in his assignment

as Regional Security Oificer ive the Far East.

2.

As iny Assistant, Mr. O'Connell shares with me the re-

sponsibility for the direction of the investigative and operational

support programs of the Office of Security. He brings to this posin

rion a wealth of experience, sound management concepts, and the

ability to meet and solve complex administrative problems. I have

implicit confidence in his judgment, and he enjoys the full respect

of all of his associates. Mr. O'Connell has made an outstanding

contribution to the management and direction of lOS at a time when

our work load is the highest in history.

He is susceptible to inno-

vation and has a keen appreciation of cost factors in meeting his

managerial responsibilities. He has a unique ability to put work

problems in the proper focus, does his job without fanfaré, and

maintains extremely high standards of work accomplishment.

3. Mr. O'Connell's performance fully justifies his promotion

to the supergrade level and, in the relatively short time he has been

in his current assignment, his overall performance is considered

unusually strong with many outstanding aspects.

Cer, chief of the Regional KUSODA Support Staff for nearly

three years,

is 40 ycars old and a career enployee with

nore than

13 years scryice.

Although this has been his first overscas tour,

he and his lanily are felt adjusted to foreign assigunenig

and he

Is apparently able and milling to serve in any position offered.

As the senior KUSODA officer in the Far Jast,

he directs the

activities of six officers on his orn staff as veli as supervises

and provides guidance to all other KUSODA officers assigned in the

Far East; in addition he ronitors the performance of three other.

KUSODA officers attached to this Station.

In this supervisory

role, he has an excellent insight into the abilities of his staft

and definitely holds the respect of his subordinates.

As the senior KUSODA officer he is my principle adviser on

-any KUSODA

matters.

His judgrent is mature, his evaluations

usually sound.

He

is dependable and I believe his loyalty to our

service and his superiors

is above question.

He operates his staff vell, is cost conscious and requires an

al solute mininum of superiston

fron Station connand.

He maintains excellent liaison reintionships nith other island

services:

mama will continue to develop and can assure positions of

greater responsibility.

I rate this officer as Strong--on the high side.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Director of Security

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Deputy Director of Security (IOS)

O'CONNELL, James P.

(Fitness Report)

Mr. O'Connell is completing ten years of Agency service and his

experience qualification includes four years of service with the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree from

St. John's University.

This evaluation covers Mr. O'Connell's first year assignment

as Chief of the Security Support Division. It is felt that the outstand-

ing accomplishments of this Division during this period are in large

measure attributable to Mr. O'Connell's managerial skill. During

this time the Security Support Division, without additional personnel,

has increased its production substantially and in the area of operational

support has handled many unique and diverse assignments.

Mr. O'Connell has a keen and analytical intellect and a broad

understanding of the investigative and security problems inherent in

his job.. He applies these qualities with his talent for administration

to make for an overall outstanding performance.

Mr. O'Connell has the capacity for further development and

his future training should be directed to senior management courses

to insure the full development of this potential.

(Investigations and Support)

O'CONNELL, James P., Jr.

(Fitness Report)

1. This report constitutes a continuing evaluation of Mr.

"O'CONNELL'S performance as Chief, Support Branch, Security

Support Division.

2. Mr. O'CONNELL's performance in terms of productivity

and quality has been outstanding in every respect. His responsibill

ties have been most exacting and demanding, not only because of the

administrative requirements involved, but also because of the urgent

and unprecedented nature of the problems he is called upon to handle.

Many of these problems have had Agency-wide txplications and have

been of interest to high Agency officials.

He has met the challenges

presented to him in a superb fashion and in a manner reflecting

credit upon himself and the Security Office. In addition to this

statement of evaluation, it should be noted that Mr. O'CONNELL,

upon the recent completion of his assignment as Chief, Support

Branch,

SSD, and his promotion to Deputy Chief, SSD, received a

commendation from the Director of Security commending him for

his over-all splendid performance with particular reference to his

handling of an ultra sensitive matter of interest to the highest authori-

ties of the Agency.

3. In terms of potential, Mr. O'CONNELL's performance,

his impressive physical appearance and personality, coupled with his

proven powers of judgment and administration, in the opinion of the

rater constitute him as being of potential executive caliber.
