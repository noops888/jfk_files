directorate took or on important, added responsibility -the security
of automatic data processing, ‘This function covers the complerity
of maintaining security in a rapidly expanding activity replete with
serious security problems because of the severe compaction of
information resulting from rapid advances and acceptability of
technology in the ficld of data handling. The achievements of the
Physical Security Division, the Technical Division, and the Over=
seas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordina-
fion in order to avoid contradictions detrimental to a unified
security policy,

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely
located from his office, Mr, O'Connell has applied and achieved
effective supervision, The Divisions moved forward in an +

received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in
applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the
assignment of action with appropriate coordination. H

3. Mr. O'Connell is ‘a personable and articulate senior ly

executive who writes particularly well, He has had extensive ii
experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and cae it
overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance - iQ
ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing !
responsibility. Ihave no reservations about rating his performance a
in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING.

4, In searching for an area where Mr. O'Conficll might strive

-for further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the light of
“his consistently high performance record, Ido believe, however,
that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance tor
the first six months in this position, It is possible that this is due
tothe fact that the problems we encounter today require more
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasi and
initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive

for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

gained added importance and increased attention during the year,
It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to
the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole. Mr, O'Connell
has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our
vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from
domestic efforts resulting from national unrest, Mr. O'Connell
has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his respon-
sibilities throughout the current rating period, He supervises his
people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to

simplify their solutions.

1, This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1968
through 31 March 1969,

2. Mi. O'Connell was appointed Deputy Director of Security
for Physical, Technical and Overseas Security in August 1968 and
this Rating covers his performance during this period as well as
his performance as Executive Officer from 1 April 1968 to 1 August
1968. :

3. Mr, O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for Physical,
Technical and Overseas Sccurity, is responsible for the supervision
of three large and complex divisions of this Office, In addition,
he is responsible for providing policy and technical guidance to
our Area Security Officers assigned io other components of the
Agency and in the field. Upon assuming his duties in August 1968,
Mr. O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of
these varied and complex activities. He is an alert and intelligent
supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several signifi-
cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate
which have resulted in significant improvement in the overall
efficiency and effectiveness of the Directorate. Recently, he was
instrumental in creating a new Overseas Security Support Division

Chief, Executive Staff

1, Mr, O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of
this Office from | April 1967 to.31 March 1968, the rating period
covered by this Fitness Report.

2. Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration
and dircction-of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the
functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective
in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic
security policies and procedures, In addition, he has performed :
diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper
that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been
meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving
this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective
in arranging priority action in mecting.short deadlines, As the
initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence
received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in
applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the
assignment of action with appropriate coordination,

3. Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior
executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive
experience as a Security carecrist, both in Headquarters and
overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance-
ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing
responsibility. I have no reservations about rating his performance
in this position over the past year as OUTSTANDING,

4, In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive
for.further improvement, I am hard put to find any in the lightof
his Consistently high performance record. I do believe, however,
that. Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance for
the first gix-months in this position. It is possible that this is due
to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and
initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive
for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

of examining the historical progression of the ADP from several points of view. All
the speakers were highly qualified in thelr particular field and their presentations wero
well prepared, All were exceptionally apt in fielding questions.

has an engaging, friendly personality and is effectively articulate. If I were to single

"out any weakness tt would be Mr. Engelhardt's lecture, He spoke on the Systems .
Analyst. In his presentation he seamed not to take into consideration the professional
level of the group and devoted.an inordinate amount of time on basic managerial
precepts. . This seemed to have an irritating effect on the participants who by virtue
of their positions had considerable experince in the management field.

Overall I would say, notwithetanding the above observation, it ts an interesting

signed from Assistant Deputy Director of Security (IOS) to Chief,

As Assistant to the DDS(IOS), Mr. O'Connell applied excep-

outstanding contribution to the management of IOS at a time of
the heaviest work pressures in our history. Mr. O'Connell has
a calm, clinical approach to work problems, and his solutions to
these problems reflect the soundness of his judgment and the
breadth of his experience. He expresses himself clearly and con-
cisely in both writing and speech. As Assistant DDS(IOS), he
demonstrated sound management concepts and acute cost con-
sciousness, His strength as a supervisor is reflected in the
universal respect he enjoys among all subordinates.

iod of distinguished service that was culminated in his assignment

as Regional Security Oificer for the Far East.

2. As my Assistant, Mr. O'Connell shares with me the re-
sponsibility for the direction of the investigative and operational
support programs of the Office of Security, He brings to this posi-
tion a wealth of experience, sound management concepts, and the
ability to meet and solve complex administrative problems, I have
implicit confidence in his judgment, and he enjoys the full respect
of all of his associates. Mr. O'Connell has made an outstanding
contribution to the management and direction of IOS at a time when
our work load is the highest in history, He is susceptible to inno-

ation and has a keen appréciation of cost factors in meeting his
managerial responsi es. He has a unique ability to put work
problems in the proper focus, does his job without fanfaré, and
maintains extremely high standards of work accomplishment.

3, Mr, O'Connell's performance fully justifies his promotion
to the supergrade level and, in the relatively short time he has been
in his current assignment, his overall performance is considered’
unusually strong with many outstanding aspects,

Grade 2 16 No. of Studente 2 33

EOD Date 3 December 1951

COURSE CBJECTIVES AND METHOD

contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial etyles in Grid
terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop téam action
‘skilla; increase ¢ andidnesa of communication; strengthen the use of critique for
problem-solving and. learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Cul-

ture and Nevelopment,

Thé method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of
level or experience, A Grid Seminar ia not "taught" in the uaual sense, In
Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems, Objective solu-
tlons are made available, Individual and team performance is repeatedly
assessed, Various measuring instruments are used to evaluate cffectiveness,

Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might chango
his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectivences, Thus managers
are not told the beet way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves,

About twenty to thirty houre of study are completed as prework, Insights

gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminar,

1, When

Acting D/COS, He served in this capacity from early

April until his departure on 16 June 1965,

2, Within a matter of days he was performing
the assigned duties in a superior manner, He most
certainly demonstrated sound judgment, dependability
and mature tolerance. The latter is an essential for
the daily problems unique to any post type service,

3. As to his executive or leadership qualities
I believe I can save several paragraphs by stating
simply that within a week of assuming his new assign-
ment I left on a G-day TDY and within 30 days de-
parted south for over 3 weeks. and in each case departed
with abgolute assurance the Station was in good hands,

and it was.

I would like to take this opportunity to belatedly
express the sincere appreciation of both my office and
the Broadcasting Service of this Agency for the assist-
ence rendered by ernployees of your staff, Mr, James
O'Connell and Mr, Exvon Kuhnke in September and
December of last year. This assistance consisted of : :
picking up tape recordiiigs prepared by Radio Moscow i
in the possession of Mr, Paul Frederick Deuer, 1923

delivering them to my office for the information of our
Broadcasting Service, In addition to this service, Mr.
Kuhnke of your staff readily volunteered to see that
these tapes were returned to Mr. Dauer and this
latter service was performed last month.

The excellent spirit of Maison co-operation

it is hoped that I might be of service in some similar
matter in the future,

Sincerely,
