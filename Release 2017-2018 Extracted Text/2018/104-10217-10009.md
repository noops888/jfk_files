1. Cn 4 June 1SE2 Corwin attended a cocktail party given
by the Argentinian Charge d'affaires tn henor of feron's reelec-
tion to the presidency. The party wag not too far alon;; when
Corwin encountered Feodor Alexeivite! RANIN, @ fipat secretary
of the Soviet Legaticn. Corwin had met CARANIN once before at |

qi@ cocktail party given by H. Bartlett Yells, American First
w Secretary. On this cecasion (at the Argentinian party) Corwin
greeted the Russian with "How do you do, Lr. Garanin." The
>» latter replied ard enswered in turn, "How do you do, Kr. Cor- |
win," using the latter's true name, of course. cCaranin said,
- "You have a good cexory," whereupon Corwin replied, "My memo-
ry is almost as ¢ccd as yours." Garanin smiled and that ended
the incident for the monent. =

2. Later, in searching for his wife, Corwin fuund her

engaged in conversation with Garanin. Corwin joined the group

and chatted for a minute. Caranin then seid that "we must have

lunch one of these days." Corwin indicated his willingness to

this. At that point he introduced Garanin to Lt. Col. Howard

Van De Car, United States Air Attacne. Caranin said thet he

knew Col. Van De Car but Van De Car later told Corwin that he

could not recall ever having met Garanin before. Shoruty after ‘
this Garanin excused himself but told Corwin that he would re-

Aurn to the subject later. It will be interesting to see.whe-

Garanin and I. I.‘NARTCHCUK, a second secretary at tne Sovier

exhibited a short temper on occasions with Wells and reportedly

lost his temper completely during a meeting with Kr. AsR<2LLAS,

forcer British First Secretary. On this occasion Garanin had

needled Kellas in a fairly rough fashion. Kellas had replied

in kind, and Garanin had lust his temper and left. 4

5. Garanin speaks fairly good English. Martchouk does not
speak Englasu but, according to Wells, speaks French. It is not
believed that Garenin's expressed desire to have lunch with Cor-
win has any special significance as such, particularly in light
of his similar approach to Hajjar. It is interesting to note,
however, tnat Garanin is currently anpearing in such a friendly
fashion despite the Soviet Union's dissatisraction witn our
Poiicy in Germany. as
