Dear Sir:

Referenee is made to your letter of December 13th,
1975 concerning our client, Mitchell Livingston
WerPell, III and his request for information under
the Freedom of Information Act.

I am enclosing a notarized statement providing you
with the address and place of birth of Mr, WerBell.

With regard to your last paragtaph asking for clari-
fication as to which records he desires to have
searched, we, of courge, are not familiar with your.
files or filing system, Mr. WerBell spent sometime
in the United States Army during World War II and
has traveled extensively since that time. He was in
Cuba at the time of the Castro military operation,

in the Dominican Republic during that military opera-
tdon and in Thailand and Viet Nam during the Viet Nam
War. We feel quite confident your office must have
extensive files and documentation concerning Mr. Were
Bell and this request for information is intended to

hee Fowly
