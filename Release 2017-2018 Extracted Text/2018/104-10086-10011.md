Subject: Background on iexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1, (Unilateral coverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

(April 1947) (oy Baa Doyle) until arrival of Win Seott as COS in 1958, Charles

Anderson TIT (still in LA/HQ) had developed @ support apparatus to wMEEEoTE

eyploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy, This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

devices. These hed sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

nearby, The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE i
for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built
on this site), - LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo vase to LIMITED,

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street

the front gate of the Soviet Embassy, The agents’ in LITE Oe (both
