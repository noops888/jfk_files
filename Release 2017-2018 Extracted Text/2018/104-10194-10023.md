Hunt hes not only carried the duties and reeponsibilttios
of Information Officer, pending appointment of a to
that post, but he has, additionally, carried « tee load £%
in connection with the Ross aurder incident. He has acted
persons) aide, to all intente and purposes, at a time when,
understaffed ae thie Miasion 1s, we were faced with a concentra-
tion of vitally important work in conneotion with our normal
Kiesion operations.

1 think Huat has “shown a broad-gauged grasp of what ERP is,

In your wemo of 24 February 1969 to the Director of Personnel

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT : Howard E, Munt, GS-15, Employee
Number 015842, DOB: October 1918; ~

EUR/CA; Career; Service Designa=
tion: oD,
PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 22 June 1968 - 31 March 19687

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7

OVER-ALL RATING 2: Strong

1. Mr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA fn ~
July 1968, His performance in this position has beon con-

sistently Strong.

2. From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's
Special Activities Staff, Mr. Munt has made a substantial
contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational
concepts which has been underway in the Division since the
termination over the past two years of many long established
projects, He has a fine political senso and a sound grasp of
European realities and evolutions, While con¢erned with the
role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially
operational, imaginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the
recognition of opportunities and tho stimulation of specific
action in the field, In both these areas he has shown a power
of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views
and persistance and vigor in Nelping get action underway

3. There are three primary areas in which Mr. Hunt has
played an important role in the Division's business, The
first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches
and Stations in the conduct of on~going CA action, and the
modification and relocation of certain activities of concern
to the Senior Staff and other divisions, He has brought to
this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-
ties, an excellent avareness of realities in the field and of
the practical limits imposed by the ficld priorities, manpower,
and the requirements of sectirity. *



4,° Secondly,, Nr. Hint has carried with him from SAS
a continuing participation in the work of-that staff in its
two aspects: the countering of Sovict political action and
a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party
operations, Ho has contributed to the definition of these
interests and worked. closely with the Branches in ident
fying opportunities. Neither of these areas are of a nature
that. has made -for prompt common understanding between Head=
quarters and the ficld. Yr. Hunt's TDY's have been of
major assistance in furthering this understandings

_5, Thirdly, Mr, Hunt has assumed a particularly im-
portant role in responding to-requirenonts for memoranda,
studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked
to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra>
tion in January. Intimately coupled with this is direct
support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-
ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses
and studies which have derived from that partictpation,

6. In all these duties, Mr, Hunt's performance has
reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination, He has had,
to His erédit, the advantage of exccllent give and take
with the Division's branches and a sound knowledge of branch
people and capacities. He has drawn with equal effective-
ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other
divisions and senior staffs, and upon ’a deep experience of
the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting

business done at Headquarters.

7. In summary, Mr. Hunt's has been tho performance of
a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a
period which has somewhat changed the nature of the CA
officer's duties within the Division.

REVIEWING OFFICER'S COMMENTS:

Although I would not differ from the evaluative
comment on this.officer, I would be inclined to rate his
over-all pérformance as highly PROFICIENT rather than
Strong, in view of his broad experience and grade. This
officer has had a series of personal and taxing problems,
beyond his control, wliich have tended to dull his cutting
edge just enough to be noticeable.

domorietrat

Subject has-performed in a manner q t Wien with his long and broad ex
perience in many aspects of the. craft of intelligence, His senior grade, his special
expertise in the field of propaganda and publféation‘and his very high intellect

have contributed to the division's operations ia the public media field a sharp (ie
focus, an economical ‘concentration of money and effort and a consequently

héightened impact. “In the WUHUSTLER project, Subject vindicated his faith in

_ a moribund clandesting asset by demonstrating, after about a year and a half under
his personal direction, that it i one of the most effective activities of its kind.
Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from
visionary and diffuse direction and from poor, case officer-agent rapport, Subject's
personal handling of thie operation is marked by excellent rapport and the project
prospers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himself enthusiastically

“welcomes,

Subject's supervisory responsibility has extended over two secretaries, from one
to two professional staffers and three professional career
employees The fairness and precision of his management

has patently won their respect and inspired their performance,

ECRET

* Mr, Hunt continiied to diréct the propaganda activities of thé DOV
in-a.superlor professional manner until 12 October 1964, when’he was incapacitated
by illiess, “On his return from sick leave on 7 December, he Wis detailed to the
Office of the DD/P and officially transferred to that office on 28 February 1965. DO
Division can only view this transfer with considerable regret.

Mr, Hunt, by virtue of his personal background, has a unique flair and com=
petence in the propaganda field, Over and above, but camiplementary to these specia!
skills, his extensive experience in the CS, his sound judgment, high and creative
intellect and other commendable pérsonal qualities contributed significantly to the
successful prosecution of DO's efforts in the media field, These same atributes,
attest, in my judgment, to his suitability for employment as a Station Chief or in any
other position requiring broad knowledge of and skill in the CS business, He is very
cost conscious and an effective supervisor.’ He enjoys the respect of all personnel
under his supervision, official aad-non-official, as well as that of all his co-workers

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
: Howard E. flunt, GS-15, Employee

_, SUBJECT
Number 013842, DOB: October 1913;
EUR/CA; Career; Servico Designa-
tion: D,
PERIOD UNDER REVIEW : 22 June 1968 - 32 March 19689

MONTHS UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7

OVER-ALL RATING : Strong

1. Mr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA in
July 1968. His performance in this position has been con-
sistently Strong.

2. From the period of ‘his previous assignment to EUR's
Special Activities Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial
contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational
concepts which has been underway in the Division since the
termination over the ‘past two years of many long established
projects. Ho has a fine political sense and a sound grasp of

“European realities and evolutions. While concerned with the
role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially
operational, imaginative. and perhaps at its happiest in the
recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific
action in the field, In both these areas he has shown a power
of original thought, persuasiveness in presenting his views,
and persistance and vigor in helping get action underway,

3, There are three primary areas in which Mr, Hunt has
played an important role in the Division's business. The
first is in providing cossistent staff assistance to Branches
and Stations in the conduct of on-xotng CA action, and the
modification and relocation of certain activities of concern
to the Senior Staff and other divisions. He has brought to—
this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi-
ties, an excellent awareness of realities in the field and of
the practical limits imposed by the tield priorities, manpower,
and the requirements of security.



SECRET a

4. -Secondly, Mr. Hunt has carried with him from SAS
a continuing participation in-the work of that staff in its
two aspects:- the countering of Soviet political action and
a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party |
operations; He has contributed to the definition of these
interests and worked -closely..with the Branches in tdenti-
fying opportunities, Neither of these areas are of a nature
that has made for prompt common understanding between Head=-
quarters and the field. Mr, Hunt's TDY's have been of
major assistance in furthering this understanding.

5. Thirdly, Mr, Hunt has assumed a particularly im-
portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,
Studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked
to producé since the beginning of a new national Administra-
tion in January. Intimately coupled with this is direct
support to tho Chief of the Division in the latter's par-
ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses
and studies which have derived from that participation.

6. In all these duties, Mr, Hunt's performance has
reflected sagacity, balance, and imagination, He has had,
to his credit, the advantage of excellent give and take
with the Division's: branches and a sound knowledge of branch

- people and capacities. He has drawn with equal effective-
ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other
divisions and senior staffs, and upon a deep experience of
the mechanics, nuances and occasional delicacies of getting

business done at Headquarters.

7. In summary, Mr. Hunt's has been the performance -of
a very competent, tough-minded senior professional in a
period which has somewhat’ changed the nature of the CA
officer's duties within the Division, -

Mr, Hunt is an officer with real ability, creative and MMV/Adpguial, During
the period under review, he has done a great deal to tighten up the operaticn of
his shop, The amorphous aspects of some projects he inherited have been
eliminated or cut down to size, He hao a pleasant and engaging personality

and a broadly based background,

If there are any areas of weaknése in his performance it is only becau:
his potential is so considerable. For example, it is possible that the staff and
planning aspects of his job could receive more attention although, admittedly,
there is a large grey area between the responsibilities of the CA Staff and the

responsibilities of DODS in thie respect,

Attachment to Fitness Report of Howard Hunt 31 March 63 = 31 March 64

Section C (Continued)

Special mention should be made of Subject's objectivity and integrity in
carrying out-his responsibilities, These were best demonstrated when
he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadcast=
ing project, to éstablish which he and his subordinates had labored hard,
immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable , practical obstaclea
precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential.

* Subject's professional background has attuned his constant attention to

FI operational opportunities arising in the course of his current CA
activities, a practice consistent with his habit of seeking maximum benefit

for every. dollar spent in time, effort or cash.
