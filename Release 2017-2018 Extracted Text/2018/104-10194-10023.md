UNDER MY SUPERVISION: 7

OVER-ALL RATING

Strong

Me. Hunt took on his presont dulles as EUR/CA in

July 1968.

Ills performance in this position has beon con-

sistently Strong.

2.

From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's:

Spocial Activities Staff, Mo. Hunt has made a substantial

contribution to the refincent and recasting of CA opcrational

concepts which has bech undorany in the Division since

the

termination over

the past two years of many long established

projects.

He has a fine political sens and a sound grasp

of

European relities and evolutions.

While concerned with

the

rolo and methods of political action, his mind is essentially

operational, innginative, and perhaps at its happiest in the

recognition of opportunities and tho stimulation of specific

notion in the fleld. In both these areas he has shown a power

of oriatnal thought, persuasiveness in prosenting his views,

and persistance and vigor in helping set action underway.

3.

There are three primary arons in which h'. Hunt hns

played an important role

in the Division's business.

first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches

and Stations in the conduct of on going CA action, and the

modification and relocation of certain activities of concern

to the Senior Staff and

other divistons.

He has brought to

this work a balanced view of Division and Senior Staff equi

dies, an excellent arareness of realities in the flold and of

the proctient lintes imposed by the field priorities, manpover,

and

the requirements of security.

1.

Secondly, Ur. Hunt has carried with him from

SAS

continuing partlcipation in the work of that staff in

its

two aspects:

the countering of soviet political action

und

a reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party

opciations.

He has contributed to the definition of these

interosts and worked. closely with the Branches in identi

fying opportunities... Neither of these arcas aro of a nature

that has made for prompt common understanding between lead-

quarter's

and the field.

Sir. Hunt's TDY's have been of

major assistance in furthering this understanding

5.

Thirdly, Nr. Hunt has assumed a particularly im-

portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,:

studies

and suggestions which the Division has boen asked

to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra

tion in January.

Intimately coupled with this is direct

support to the

Chief of the Division in the latter's par-

ticipation in the

Interdepartmental Group,

and the analyses

and studles which have derived fron that participation.

In all these duties, Sir. Hunt's performance has

reflected sagacity, balance,

and imagination.

lie has harl

tö his crodit, the idvantage of excollent give and take

with the Division's branches and a sound knowlodge of branch

pcople and capacities.

He has drawn with equal effective-

ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other

divisions and sentor staffs, and upon a deep experience of

the mechanics, nuances and occasional dolicacies of getting

busincss done at llendquarters.

In summary, ir. Hunt's has been the performance of

tough-minded senior professional in a

period which has somewhat changed the nature of the CA

officer's duties

within the Division.

Suljeet has performed in a manner quite donastent wish his long and broad ex-

perience in many aspects of the craft of intelligence. His senior grade, his special

expertise in the field of propaganda and publication'and his very high intellect

have contributed to the division's operationa in the public media field a sharp

focus, an economical Concentration of money and effort and a consequently

heightened impact. In the WUHUSTLER project, Subject vindicated his faith in

a moribund clandestine asset by demonstrating, after about a year and a half under

his personal direction, that it is one of the moat effective activities of its kind.

Before Subject assumed direct responsibility for this project, it had suffered from

visionary and diffuse direction and from poor case officer agent rapport.

Subject's

personal handling of thie operation is marked by excellent rapport and the project

prospers on an entirely reoriented basis which the agent himself enthusiastically

welcomes.

Subject's supervisory responsibility has extended over two

secretaries, from one

to two professional staffers

and three professional career

employeesL

The fairness and precision of his management

has patently won their respect and inspired their performance.

spit Mr. Hunt continued to direct the propaganda activities of the Der tirin

in a superior professional manner until 12 October 1964, wh-a'he was incapacitated

by illriess. On his return from sick leave on ? December, he was detailed to the

Office of the DD/P and officially transferred to that office on 23 February 1965.

Division can only view this transfer with considerable regrer.

Mr. Hunt, by virtue of his personal background, has 1 unique flair and com

petence in the propaganda. field. Over and above, bur complementary to these special

akills, his extensive experience in the CS, his sound judgment, high and creative

intellect and other commendable personal qualities contributed significantly to the

successful prosecution of DO's efforts in the media field These same attributes,

attest, in my judgment, to his suitability for employment as a Station Chief or in any

other position requiring broad knowledge of and skill in the CS business. He is very

cost conscious and an effective supervisor.' He enjoys the respect of all personnel

under his supervision,

official and non-official, as well as that of all his co-workers

OVER-ALL RATING

: Strong

Nr. Hunt took on his present duties as EUR/CA in

July 1968.

Ills performance in this

position has been con-

sistently

2.

From the period of his previous assignment to EUR's

Special Activitles Staff, Mr. Hunt has made a substantial

contribution to the refinement and recasting of CA operational

concepts which has been underway in the Division since

termination over the past two yenis of many long established

projects.

Europenn

realities and evolutions.

While concerned with the

role and methods of political action, his mind is essentially

operational, Imaginative. and perhaps at its happiest in the

recognition of opportunities and the stimulation of specific

action in the field.

In both

these areas he

has shown a power

of orleinal thought, persuasiveness

in

presenting his views,

and persistanco and vigor

in helping get action underway.

There are three primary arens in which ir. Hunt has

played an important role

the Division's business.

first is in providing consistent staff assistance to Branches

in the conduct of on going CA action, and the

modification and relocation of certain activitles

of concern

to the Sentor Staff and

other divisions.

He has brought to

vicw of Division and Senior Staff equi

ah excellent awreness of realitios in the field and of

the practical limits

imposed by the tield priorities, manpower,

the requirements of security.

its nett

4. Secondly, Mr, lunt has carried with him from SAS

• continuing particloation

in the work of that staff In its

two aspects:

the countering of Soviet political action and

i reawakened and redefined concern with Communist Party.

operntions:

Ho has contributed

to the definition of these

interests

and worked closely with the Branches In identi

fying

opportunities.

Noither of these areas are of a nature

that has made for prompt common understanding between Head

quarters

and the field.

Mr. Hunt's TDY's have been of

major assistance in furthering this understanding.

Thirdly, Mr. Hunt has assumed a particularly 1-

portant role in responding to requirements for memoranda,

studies and suggestions which the Division has been asked

to produce since the beginning of a new national Administra

tion in January.

Intimately coupled with this is direct

support to the Chief of the Division in the latter's par-

ticipation in the Interdepartmental Group, and the analyses

and studios which have derived iron that participation.

6.

In all these duties, Mr. Hunt's performance has

reflected

sagacity, balance,

and

imagination.

He has had,

to his credit.

the advantage of excellent give and take

with the Division's branches

and a sound knowledge of branch

people and

capacitles.

He has

drawn with equal effective

ness upon a broad range of personal associations in other

divisions and sentor

staffs, and

upon a deep

experience

of

the mechanics, nuances

and occasional delicacies of getting

business done at Headquarters.

In summary,

dr, Hunt's has been the performance.of

a very competent,

tough-minded senior professional in a

period which

somewhat changed

the nature of the CA

officer's duties within the Division.

Mi. Hunt is an officer with real ability,

creative and mdAfraial. During

the perlod under review, he has done a great deal to tighten up the operation of

hia shop,

The amorphous aspects of some projecta he inherited have been

eliminated or cut down to sire. He has a pleasant and engaging personality

and a broadly based background.

Il there are any areas of weakness in his performance it is only because

his potential is so considerable.

For example, it is possible that the staff and

planning aspects of his job could receive more attention although, admittedly,

there is a large grey area between the responsibilitiea of the CA Stalf and the

responsibilities of DODS in this respect.

Department of State cover from 1966 until he retired 1a 1970. Upon

• rcttrement, Mr. Hurt was " opened up " as a CIA employee back to

EOD in November 1949.

In the absence of both Mesgry. Osborn, Director of Security,

and Geiss, Depury Director, I discussed the State Department request

with Mi. Leo Duns; Acting Deputy Director of Securiy for Pergonnel

Security, He concluded that everything considered, the Department

should say that Mr. Hunt was assigaed to the Department while in

Irtegrated status bul, when pressed, not deny his basic ClA status.

While trying to clear this line with the ADDP, Mr. Celsa called and

at the end of our discussion, cauloned that any guldance to the

Department of State In regard to Mr. Hurt should be cleared vith the

DCLe

As I vas leaving my office, Mr. Tegetholt called Vis.

Frankitn a seched time to say that la the evening of 20 juse 1972.

Pit, Jcha Klps, Department of State'a Press Office, and Mr. John

Unumb of CLA bad discussed press Loquirtes la regard to Mr. Hum

which vere made to the Department of State lo the aftérnoon of

20 Jane 1972. Tocee Inquistes had particular reference to Mr. Hunt's

clography la WHO'S WHO NAVERIC, showing bim as Department of

State employee since 1968 and listing his olfice at the Department of

State. Mesars. Unib and King igreed the press should be laformed

chat he was not on the Stace Department's payroll during the period.

Mr. Uaumb contrized this arrangement when I called him and sald

tcat he had added that Mr. Hurt retlred in good standing from CLA

8a April 1920. 1 alse clerred the proposed guidance with Me. Ted

Shackley, Chiel, WH DIvalon.

I then saw Mesars. Colby and Meyer, outlined the Department

of State's request and our proposed reply that Mir. Hurt, duriag his

Integrated service in Mexico and

was assigied to the

Department of State. This Iuormation would not be volunteered by the

Department of State, and Mr. Hunt's basic status as a CIA employee

would not be denied ll raised by members of the press, Messre: Colby

aa Meyer agreed that this was the only feasible line to take. I then

23 kod Mr. Colby whether additonal clearance from the DCI was required.

He replied that i was not, and that he would brief the Dal.

'I inforied Mr. Geiss of Messrs. Colby's and Meyer's decision

Attachment to Fitness Report of Howard Hunt 31 March 63 - 31 March 64

Section C (Continued)

Special mention should be made of Subject's objectivity and integrity in

carrying out his responsibilities. These were best demonstrated when

he promptly and swiftly terminated a large and effective radio broadeast-

ing project, to establish which he and his subordinates had labored hard,

immediately upon belated discovery that insuperable, practical obstacles

precluded realization of the project's theoretical potential.

Subject's professional background has attuned his constant attention to

Fl operational opportunities arising in the course of his current CA

activities, a practice consistent with his habit of eeeking marimum benefit

for every dollar apent in time, effort or cash.
