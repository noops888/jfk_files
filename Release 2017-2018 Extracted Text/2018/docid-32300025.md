HACKER said he listened to the proposition only
to ascertain the extent of ROTHMAN's interest in muscling
in on the Hotel Workers Union. He said he then presented
this proposition to JACK WEINBURGER, formerly Organizational
Secretary, now General: Secretary of the Union, WEINBURGER,
stated that this must be discussed with ED MILLER, who
agreed- with the proposal, except the appointment of ROTHMAN
as International Representative. MILLER indicated he would:
get around this somehow. In December, 1954, HACKER was
telephonically contacted by ED MILLER and instructed.to. tumn
over, the affairs of Local 255 to one ALBERT BERLIN, a former
associate of the gangster element, This appointment in
HACKER's opinion indicated ROTHMAN had gotten to MILLER,
apparently through ROGER LEBENNER, Business: Agent. for Local
133 of the Hotel Workers Union, and. that MILLER was working
with ROTHMAN. HACKER stated he could never work with
MILLER and resigned on December 13, 1954. HACKER stated
that in April, 1955, the first hotel in Miami Beach was
struck by the Hotel Workers Union, and the strike which
presently involves 22 hotels is still going on. The Hotel
Workers Union is pouring $120,000 a month into this strike.
He can only conclude the hotel operators did not accede to
ROTHMAN's shakedown. He is convinced, however, that ROTHMAN +
made the attempt, and that MILLER is cooperating with him.

On July. 30, 1956, AL MANHEIM advised that ABE
GOODMAN was in the bolita business in Cuba with ELI QUAIN.
and NORMAN ROTHMAN. fae

On July 30, 1956, NORMAN ROTHMAN, Chicago, i
Illinois, shipped 32,800 pounds of gambling equipment
to NORMAN ROTHMAN, Miami, Florida. The equipment arrived
in Miami, Florida, on August 3, 1956, and was located at
Tamiami Tours, Inc., Transport Capany. The U. S. Attorney,
Miami, Florida, authorized the seizure of this equipment;
and the equipment was seized on August 6, 1956, and turned -*
over to the US Marshal on August 7, 1956. Prosecution of
ROTHMAN was declined by the US Attorney's Office, Miami,
Florida, and the gambling equipment was destroyed.
