1. STATION UNCLEAR AS TO PURPOSE SERVED BY PUBLICATION

PHOTO OF PERSON NOT EVEN INVOLVED THIS CASE. SINCE OSWALD

MOTHER HAS NO COPY OF PHOTOS SHOWN HER, SEE NO NEED PUBLISH

PHOTO SHE COULD NOT EVEN PROVE HAD BEEN SHOWN HER. SEEMS

DUBIOUS THAT SHE WOULD QUERY ABSENCE IN REPORT OF PHOTO

SHOWN HER SEVERAL MONTHS PRIOR, WHICH DOUBIFUL SHE COULD

IDENTIFY AS SAME PIC IN ANY CASE. IN UNLIKELY EVENT SHE DID

QUERY, THIS WOULD FIT INTO PUBLIC CONCEPT OF HER SHREW RISHNESS.

2. IF AS MEXI PREFERS TO BELIEVE OF ODENVY SHE SHOWN

SPREAD OF CROPPED PHOTOS ALL OF WHICH TO APPEAR, NO OBJECTION
