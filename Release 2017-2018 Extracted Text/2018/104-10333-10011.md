SUBCECT: DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect
to JFK Assassination Records

1. Per your request, I have attached a copy of the
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of .
1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-3458, reprinted at
44 U.S.C. § 2107 note. For ycur convenience, I have hig
tinent provisions that will aid in reszcond
ry regarding the statute's effect on the DCI’ ei statutory
ty to protect intelligence sources and metheds.

2. The clear language and intent of the law is to supersede
statutes that prohibit disclcsure of information, except for some
irrelevant subject areas, such as tax records. The statute
provides that "it shall take" ‘precedence over any other law
{except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code), judicial
decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would
otherwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the
Act. ARCA § 11(a). This language, taken with the provisions
discussed below which limit the intelligence sources and methods
that may be protected and set a strict procedural scheme by which
information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively ee
supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect

intelligence sources and methods information subject to the

3. Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the
release of information may be "postponed." The statute
contemplates that all information will eventually be released.
Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available
to the public no later than 25 years after the passage of the
ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president
certifies that continued postponement is necessary. ARCA
§ 4(g)(2)(D). With respect to intelligence-related information,

"(1) the threat to ... intelligence operations ... is
of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and
such public disclosure would reveal--

(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently
requires protection;

(B) an intelligence source or method which is
currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be
utilized, by the United States Government and which has
not_been officially disclosed, the disclosure of which
would interfere with the conduct of intelligence
activities; or

(C) any other matter currently relating to...

intelligence operations ... the disclosure of which
would demonstrably impair the national security of the

United States."
ARCA § 6(1) (Emphasis added.)

4. The originating agency is ts make the first review to
idenrify information that meets the standards for postponement.
ARCA § 4(c)(2)(D) (i). For CIA, this effort is being undertaken
by the Historical Review Group, in consultaticn with the
Directorate of Operations and other appropriate Agency
components. Information the originating agencies identify for
postponement must be transmitted to the Review Board. ARCA
§ 4(c)(2)(E). The Review Board "shall consider and render
decisions on a determination by a Government office to seek to
postpone the disclosure of assassination recerds.* ARCA §

7(i) (1). Specifically, the “Review Board shail consider and
render decisions on ... whether an assassination record or
particular information in a record qualifies for postponement of
disclosure under the Act." ARCA § 7(i) (2) (B).

5S. If the Review Board determines to orSer the disclosure
of information that the originating agency feit met the criteria
for postponement, it "shall notify the head cf the originating
body of its determination and publish a copy of the determination
in the Federal Register within 14 days after the determination is
made." ARCA § 9(c) (4) (A). If the information contained in an
assassination record is “obtained or developed solely within the
executive branch, the President shall have the
nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or postponement
of ... the information under the standards set forth in
Section 6." ARCA § 9(d)(1) (emphasis added). The President's
decision must be certified to,the Review Board within 30 days of
.the Review Boards determination. Id. Records postponed by the ~
-President must be re-reviewed every S years. ARCA § 9(d)(2).

tion, it is important to emphasize and clarify the legislative intent
and importance of particular provisions of the Act. .
Defining assassination records

“‘Assassination records” are defined in Section 3. The definition
of “assassination records” is a threshold consideration for the suc-
cessful implementation of the Act. Its scope will be the barometer -
of public confidence in the release of assassination records. While
the records of past presidential commissions and congressional
committees established to investigate the assassination of President
Kennedy are included as assassination records under this Act, it is
intended and emphasized that the search and disclosure of records
under this Act must go beyond those records. While such records
are valuable, they reflect the views, theories, political constraints,
and prejudices of past inquiries. Proper implementation of this Act
and providing the American public with the opportunity to judge
the surrounding history of the assassination for themselves, re-
quires including not only, but going beyond, the records of the
Warren and Rockefeller Commissions, and the Church and House
Select Assassination Committees.

The term “assassination record” was not more specifically de-
fined by the Committee because. to do-so before more is known
about the universe of records would have been premature, and
would have further injected the government between the records
and the American public. There is a sufficient volume of known as-
sassination records to organize and review at the outset. However,
it is intended that the Review Board issue guidance to assist in ar-
ticulating the scope or universe of assassination records as govern-
ment offices and the Review Board undertakes their responsibil-
ities. Such guidance will be valuable notwithstanding the fact that

government offices will begin to organize and review their records. .

before the Review Board is established. Government offices are re-
quired to begin the review and disclosure of records upon enact-
ment to expedite public access to the many records which do not
require additional review or postponement. However, the ultimate
work of the Review Board will involve not only the review of
records recommended for postponement, but requiring government
offices to provide additional information and records, where appro-
priate. Guidance, especially that developed in consultation with the
public, scholars, and affected government offices, will prove valia-
ble to ensure the fullest possible disclosure and create public confi-
dence in a working definition that was developed in an independ-
ent and open manner.

Autopsy Records

The Act ‘ifically excludes from the definition of “assassi-
nation records” the autopsy records and copies or reproductions
made from att records donated by the Kennedy family pursuant
to a deed of gift-executed on October 29, 1966. These records in-
clude the autopsy photographs and X-rays of President Kennedy.
The Committee believes that this exclusion is a sound policy. The
Committee believes that there is a compelling justification for pro-
tecting the privacy of the Kennedy family from the unwarranted



" ments around the world, an

the date of enactment unless, in the case of executive branch
records, the President demonstrates that public disclosure will
result in an identifiable harm to the national security, intelligence
operations, or foreign relations of the United States.

The Assassination Records Review Board is an independent
agency within the executive branch. The five-member Review
Board will be appointed by the President with the advice and con-
sent of the United States Sonate. ‘The confirmation hearings will be
conducted by the Committee on Governmental Affairs. The Act re- °
quires that the Review Board include at least one historian and
one attorney, and that each member is a national pro-
fessional in his or her field. The legislation requires that prior to
making the appointments, the President is required to consider rec-
ommendations from the American Historical ation, the Orga-
nization of American Historians, the Society of American Archi-
vists, and the American Bar Association.

‘To ensure a comprehensive search and disclosure of assassination
records, particularly to enable the public to obtain information and
records beyond the scope of previous official inquiries, the Review
Board has the authority to direct any government office to produce
additional information and records which it believes are related to
the assassination. It has the authority to subpoena private persons
and to enforce the subpoenas through the courts.

The Review Board is authorized for a two-year period and it may
be extended by a majority vote of the Review Board for up to an
additional year. The iew Board-could decide to extend it exist-
ence to less than one year if that is the time determined as neces-
sary to complete its work. Annual financial reports and other peri-
odic reports are required to be Provided to the Congress. The re-
Ports must include statements of progress, the level of cooperation
of government offices and agencies, and the possible need for addi-
tional time or authority from Congress.

IV. BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassi-
nated. It was a tragic and defining moment in American history.
‘The desire by the American public to understand who assassinated
President Kennedy, and why, has resulted in several official inves-
tigations and a broad spectrum of private inquiries and scholar-
aay Unfortunately, in the eyes of the public, each investigation
and inquiry se to raise additional questions, and did so while
increasing the volume of secret government records about the as-
sassination. In 1992, the public demand, fostered by increased
media attention, the opening of secret files by changing overn-

other factors, culminated in the rec-
ognition by the Congress and the Executive Branch that the
records related to the assassination of President Kennedy should be
fully disclosed.

In addition to the legislation considered by the Committee, and
its counterpart considered by the House Committee on Government
Operations, four other related, though more limited, measures.
were introduced in the House of Representatives in 1992. Two bills
mandating the release of all Kennedy assassination investigation

disap proved with a protective finding,
the conformity status of the
transportstion plan and program would
not lapse as 4 result of such failure until
highwey sanctions for such failuro are
effective under other Clean Air Act
sections.

This action would delay the lapse in
conformity status, which would
otherwise prevent approval of now

Dear John:

Following this cover sheet is a courtesy copy of the Assassination

Federal Register. The proposed regulations include guidance on interpretation of the
scope of certain provisions of the Assassination Records Collection Act, including the
terms “assassination record” and “additional records and information." The Board is
soliciting comment from all interested parties and would welcome any comments that
the CIA may have. (The comment period is 30 days, the deadline is March 10.)

If you have any questions or need any additional information, please

possible conflict with our continuing protection of|

1400.5, Requirement that assassination records be released
in their entirety...and no portion withheld solely on
grounds of non-relevance. For that portion of the documents
we have declared non-relevant that is operational and is
clearly non-relevant we should argue strongly with the
Board. The Director's statutory responsibility for the
protection of sources and methods must be defended; and we
can be sure that it was not anticipated that a KGB officer
in Mexico City would be transferred to another country and
go on generating much operational information. Furthermore,
we saw it as the Board's responsibility to review the
records we identified as non-relevant and to support
publicly those of our decisions that they felt were
justified!

1400.6, Originals and copies, could cause problems if the
Board gets fussy about it. Originals of memos sent outside
the agency would be gone(to the addressee). Originals of
cables and despatches are virtually non-existant.

Léce you, ! am very concemed about the breadth of the reg’s defintions The key ta keep in mind is the
‘Sfattory authority for the Board. | would argue that the definition of “assassination mcord™ in the statute
(44 U.S.C. section 2107 note. section 3(2) of the Act) is tore fimited than the teg. The statute defines an
assassination record as one “rolated™ te the assassination of JFK. Thus, when section 1400.2 (d) and (el
of the req authorize Board access fo organizational charts of governmental agencies and records

oraanvation, and storage facilities and locations, | would aegue that such intormation Is way too far afield.
There Is no way we can allow the Board to have access to this information, which in any event is
prohibited by section 403g from disclosure notwithstanding any other law

The same issue arises with respect to se<tion 1400.7(d) of the reg that proposes to Include in-ng
definition of record any records for a person by another name or personal identfer. This would aopear to
authorize Board access to all information about an agent whe may have onty been tangentrally mvolved in
tha ascacsination but whose crypt is qiven in many other unrelated documents about unrelated
operatians. Talk about your camels nase under the tent!

Finally. section 1409.5 of the reg ratses an old dng af an issue. The National Secunty Archive (Sharyts

documents, such as the-NID, We, of course, argue that agencies are only required to process that which

Board would have access to ail Information in a documem about several unrelated operations or events it

Here is advance copy:

OGC-95-50522
1 March 1995

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Historical Review Group

FROM: Robert J. Eatinger, Jr.
Assistant General Counsel
Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT: Comments on JFK Assassination Records Proposed
Regulation

1. The following are my comments on the Assassination
Records Review Boards proposed interpretive regulations published
in the Federal Register on 8 February 1995.

2. The term assassination record is defined in the
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992, Pub.L. 102-525, 106 Stat. 3443, Oct. 26, 1992, reprinted at
44 U.S.C. § 2107 note (the Act). Any interpretive definition by
the Board cannot exceed that in the Act. The Acts definition is
found in Section 3(2) and provides:

(a) Assassination record means a record that is related to
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, that was
created or made available for use by, obtained by, or
otherwise came into possession of

various Federal, State, or local government bodies.

3. The proposed regulation is broader than that in the Act.
The proposed regulation includes as assassination records:

records, public and private, regardless of how labeled or

identified, that document, describe, report, analyze, or
interpret activities and events that may have led to the

ee USE ONLY

/


ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERVAL USE ONLY

assassination of President John F. Kennedy; the .
assassination itself; and investigations of or inquiries
into the assassination.

§ 1400.1(a). This language in overbroad in two respects. First,
the phrase events that may have led to is both broader than
relates to as in the Act and provides no articulable standard.
For instance, the theme in the Oliver Stone movie JFK appears to
be that President Kennedy was assassinated as a result of a
conspiracy to keep the war in Vietnam from winding down. Under
the proposed regulation, the Board might consider all records
concerning the war in Vietnam during the Kennedy Administration
as being assassination records. Without a standard, the phrase
is permits arbitrary and inconsistent application. Third, it
includes information about investigations and inquiries other
than those conducted by those entities identified in the Act.
Although the Board states that it is following the intent of
Congress in seeking the most comprehensive disclosure of records
related to the assassination, it appears the Board may be
exceeding its authority.

4. The definition further states that assassination record
includes, without limitation ... all records as defimed in Sec.
3(2) of the ARCA. See § 1400.1(b)(1). Thus, by its terms it
exceeds the statutory definition. Further, it is unhelpful
because by refusing to limit itself to any articulable class of
records it remains unlimited and subject to constant
re-interpretation by the Board. :

5. The proposed definition of additional information and
records under proposed § 1400.2 is objectionable because the
regulation does not provide the intended use of the definition.
The Board may be attempting to provide a definition useful in
interpreting the Boards authority under §7(j) (1) (C) (ii) of the
Act: :

The Review Board shall have the authority to act in a manner
prescribed under this Act including authority to ... direct
a Government office to make available to the Review Board,
and if necessary investigate the facts surrounding,
additional information, records, or testimony from
individuals, which the Review Board has reason to believe is
required to fulfill its functions and responsibilities under
this Act....

(Emphasis added.) If this is the case, the Board should
expressly so state and provide opportunity for informed comment
on that application, For instance, proposed § 1400.2(a) includes
all documents used by the agency during its declassification
review. This definition could include requests for legal advice
on particular matters. Such advice would be protected within the
particular agency by attorney-client privilege and should not be
provided to an extra-agency body.

Mr. David Marwell

Dear David,

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the
Assassination Records Review Board's proposed interpretive
regulations as published in the Federal Register, February
8, 1995. We recognize the value of providing guidance for
those who are responsible for implementing the Assassination
Records Collection Act.

Our general view is that the regulations are
comprehensive in identifying the range of records that would
potentially be relevant to the JFK assassination or the
scope of the investigations into the assassination.

In a few sections of the regulations the wording seems
somewhat overly broad or the meaning is not clear. Attached
for the Board's consideration are comments on these
sections. In some parts of the text we suggest possible
changes in wording for purposes of clarification.

We would be pleased to discuss these comments at the
Board's convenience. It is our intention to continue
cooperating fully with the Board and to make every effort to
release assassination records held by the Agency.

John F. Pereira

Following are CIA's comments on specific sections of the

1. Section 1400.1 Interpretation of Assassination Record

In paragraph (a) the reference to “activities and events
that may have led to the assassination--” seems overly
broad, and appears to go beyond the limits established in
the Assassination Records Collection Act. We believe that
it would be helpful to include an articulable standard in
this section. The present text would permit inconsistent
application of the regulations, which might encourage
massive and expensive, additional records searches that are
of doubtful value. i

The following change is suggested in paragraph (a):

“activities and events that may reasonably be
considered to have led to the assassination~-” (This would
be consistent with the Act.)

2. Section 1400.2 Interpretation of additional records and
information

Paragraph (a) raises a question as to the purpose and
definition of “additional records and information.” The
meaning of the phrase “all documents used--during
declassification review of assassination records as well as
all other documents--"seems unclear. Is it the intention to
include any document, book, index, record system, etc.
regardless of relevance to the assassination or
investigations, including for example, legal opinions ? We
assume that the purpose is to enable the Board to request
and review additional records.

We suggest that the section be made more specific,
including a clearer statement of the intent. For example,
with respect to cryptonyms, codewords, guides, etc. a more

- precise link to events related to the assassination or to a
timeframe could be helpful.


3. Section 1400.5 Requirement that assassination records
be released in their entirety

The introductory paragraph specifies that “no portions
of any assassination record shall be withheld--solely on
grounds of non-relevance.” This appears to open the door
for access to entire documents that contain information on
sensitive activities even when the documents contain.
information that is only incidental to the assassination,
such as a passing reference to a name. There is a potential
risk that sensitive, non-relevant sources and methods would
be compromised.

We suggest that the Board consider adding wording to this
section that accommodates those instances when there is a
need to release ample information from a document to
disclose assassination-related material, while still
protecting obviously unrelated, sensitive information. The
Board, of course, would continue to have access to the
entire record.

4. Section 1400.7 Additional guidance

Paragraph (d) states “any records identified with
respect to a particular person also includes any records for
that person by any other name, pseudonym, codeword,” etc.
This appears to require that all records on any individuals
who are merely mentioned in an assassination record be made
available. Is the objective really to assure that all files
on an individual or activity be made available regardless of
the labels on the files ? If so, we suggest that the text be
modified to reflect this. -


In the letter to David, I would add at the end of the third
paragraph:

“Our Office of General Counsel provided some legal comments
on the scope of the definition that we've included in the
attached.”

In the attachment under the comments to Section 1400.1:

After the first sentence, ending with “beyond the limits
established by the [ARCA]”, I suggest adding the following
sentences:

“The Act authorized the Board to issue interpretive
regulations. Interpretive regulations, while entitled to great
deference, cannot be inconsistent with the congressional intent
to cover only certain specific activities. Rather, they should
stay within the clearly articulated definitions provided by
Congress. This is particularly important with respect to the
definition of “assassination records” since the ARCA has a
overriding effect on other statutory grants of power found
necessary in the interests of national security, such as the
National Security Act's direction that the Director of Central
Intelligence protect intelligence sources and methods from
unauthorized disclosure. The ARCA provides a statutory standard
for protecting or “postponing” intelligence sources and methods”
that applies only to “assassination records.” The standard in
the ARCA restricts those sources and methods that can be
protected in assassination records. The Review Board is given
the ultimate authority to apply that standard, subject to being
overridden only by the President. Thus, the ARCA reflects a
‘congressional desire to limit the DCI's authority to protect
sources and methods, but only for “assassination records” as ARCA
defined it. An interpretive definition by the Board that would
sweep in records not covered by the Act, we believe, would exceed
the Board's limited rulemaking authority. Thus, the proposed
definition should be limited more clearly to those records
identified by Congress as “assassination records. To do this, we
believe ....”

2. Following are comments on specific sections of the
Assassination Records Review Board's interpretive
regulations, as published in the Federal Register, February
8, 1995.

a. Section 1400.1 Interpretation of Assassination Record

In paragraph (a) the reference to “activities and events

The following change is suggested in paragraph (a):

“activities and events that may reasonably be =
considered to have led to the assassination--” (This would
be consistent with the Act.)

b. Section 1400.2 Interpretation of additional records
and information

Paragraph (a) raises a question as to the purpose and
definition of “additional records and information.” The
meaning of the phrase “all documents used--during
declassification review of assassination records as well as
all other documents--”seems overly broad and unclear. As
presently worded, this section would appear to include any
document, book, index, record system, etc. regardless of

for example, legal opinions. We assume that the purpose is
to enable the Board to request and review additional
records.

We suggest that the section be made more specific,

appears to require that all records on any individuals -who
are merely mentioned in an assassination record be made

i.e., to assure that all files on an individual or activity
be made available regardless of the labels on the files. We

MEMORANDUM FOR: John Pereira
Barry Harrelson ©

CSI/HRG
FROM: Kathryn I, Dyer
DI/IRO
SUBJECT: Comments-~ARRB Proposed Interpretive Regulations

1. I have reviewed the proposed interpretive regulations
drafted by the Assassination Records Review Board, particularly
the sections addressing the ARRB's interpretation of the scope of
certain provisions of the Assassination Records Collection Act.
While I have comments on a number of sections, there is one
section in particular which raises serious concerns--principally
1400.2 regarding additional information and records.

2, As presently worded, this section cpens up significant
records which have nothing to do per se with the assassination,
an@ which are currently protected by various laws, including the
National Security Act of 1947, and, moreover, are exempt from
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

For example, (d) Organizational charts of government agencies.
(e) Records necessary and sufficient to describe the
the Agency's:
(1) Records policies and schedules;
(2) Filing systems and organization; and
(3) Storage facilities and location.

Items (a) and (b) of this section ( 1400.2) also pose similar
problems in that (a) includes all documents used by agencies
during their declassification review...This includes all
materials including omnibus classification guides or other
materials (i.e. not merely those prepared for use in the JFK
review) which would identify sensitive material across the board.
Similarly, item (b) includes materials "created or used by
agencies in furtherance of their review...." This entire section
should at a minimum be restricted to items created by agencies
for use in the assassination reviews. For example, if the DO has
a master list of cryptonyms, some of which appear in JFK
documents, only the subset should be included. Generic
categories of information which stand alone on their own merits
should be omitted. :

ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY


AR @1 ‘95 12:52PM

> ADMINISTRATIVE INTERNAL USE ONLY fi

Recommend: Delete items (d) and (e). Subpart (a) should be
confined to documents created by agencies (vice used) during
their declassification review.

The inclusion of generic categories of information, i.e., those
created independent of the assassination investigation(s) and
review effort, appears to be a calculated effort to gain access
to significant areas of information that are protected by other
laws (i.e., circumvention ef the FOIA.)

If provisions (d) and (e) are not deleted and a and b
not limited to materials created by or created solely for use in
the assassination review, an additional section should be added
that applies to section 1400.2 in its entirety. This should
state that information created independent of the assassination
review will be released unless protected by other laws, Executive
Orders, and/or regulations.

3. Other Comments:
1400.1 (a)

Recommend: Insert the word "reasonably" between "may have
[reasonably] led to the assassination..."

The mere allegation that foreign events or
international developments may have led to the
assassination at this point in time (after all
the investigations) should not bring records
not related to the assassination on their face
within the scope of this act. There should be
an objective standard, i.e., reasonable person
threshold. Otherwise agencies could be
subjected to massive records searches on

little more than whim. The JFK assassination is
the epitome of conspiracy theories. Without a
threshold standard, the door would be opened to
additional searches (without merit), the
potential costs of which could be significant.

1400.6 Originals and copies.

Recommend: (2) and (3) Add the word "available" after "the
earliest generation print [available] ."

Otherwise no provision to cover situation when
earliest generation print can't be located.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Periera
FROM: Gary Breneman

SUBJECT : Comments on Proposed Rules, 36 CFR
Part 1400, Concerning JFK Records
Collection Act of 1992

1. You asked that I review subject proposed rules and
provide my thoughts and concerns. This is in response to
that request.

: 2. As a general statement, the proposed rules are not
well written and seem to try to cast the biggest net
possible. With reference to poor draftsmanship, note that
at Sec.1400.2, they introduce a term “additional information
and records,” and describe what the term includes. Compare
sections 1400.3 relating to “sources” and 1400.4 relating to
“(t)ypes of materials.” In the latter, they have reversed
the term and used “additional records and information.”
While the intent is fairly clear, it causes one to wonder
what they had in mind.

3. With reference to the big net approach, it is a
basic rule of statutory and regulatory drafting to not write
laws and regulations which cannot be enforced. In this
regard, I.know of no authority in U.S. law, including the
JFK Act, which would give the Board jurisdiction over
records which “may be located at, or under the control
of,”...”(f)oreign governments.” See 1400.4 (b). I have a
similar concern with respect to “private” records. Cf. Sec.
1400.1 (a).

4. On the nonsensical side of the big net approach is.
every book, magazine and newspaper article and which has
ever been written that may “report, analyze, or interpret”
the assassination. See 1400.1 (a). If read literally, the
Agency would have to give up all of its collections of
private books, etc. which fall within this definition. This
is particularly true of those books we referred to here
within HRG for information and understanding as we conducted
the review. See 1400.2 (a) -- (a)11 documents used by
government offices and agencies during their
declassification review of assassination records...


5. With specific reference to the requirement of
1400.2 (a), the Agency should be concerned about its records
within the DO which tie crypts to true names of projects and
alias' and pseudos to the true names of individuals.

Because we regularly called the DO office responsible for
these matters for assistance in identifying the projects and
names behind the crypts and alias,' this subsection would
seem to place those document holdings within the reach of
the Board. This needs to be addressed.

5. Turning to 1400.7 (d), the Agency’ should be very
careful here. In HRG's review and release of documents, we
have often given out an alias but protected the true name.
In others, we have given out the true name but protected the
alias or pseudo. This section seems to vitiate that effort
and needs to be addressed.

6. I have several thoughts on the non-relevant issue
which would take several more paragraphs. Suffice it to
say, carried to its extreme, if the Board can in any way
make the case a document is an assassination record, then
they are entitled to access to it and may direct its
release.

7. %X would be pleased to discuss any of these items
with you if you wish.

Gary/M. Brenéman


2 March 1995
Assassination Record Definition: Comments
Background Section:

[the statement “search and disclosure of records...must go
beyond the records of previous commissions...” is based on a
similar statements on pages 19 & 21 of the Report to
accompany S. 3000]

Section 1400.1 - Interpretation of Assassination Record
(a) “An assassination record includes,...,all
records...that may have led to the assassination...”

{[S.3006 states that the “Board should act on a reasonable

basis in requesting additional records. Recommend we insert
“reasonably” into statement after “have” (or change may to

reasonably could) ]

(b) (2) "All records...or segregated by all
Federal...agencies in conjunction with any investigation...”

{means all “microfilm” documents are assassination records,
and will have to be reviewed and accounted for even if we
are successful in “postponing” most of these records]

1400.2 Interpretation of additional records and
information.

(a) “All documents used by government offices and
agencies during their declassification review of
assassination records as well as all other documents,
indices, records, and other material that disclose a
cryptonyms, code ‘ames, or other identification material in
assassination records.”

[Section (a) is too inclusive; as written would include ANY
document, book, index, record system or other material
consulted or “used” during the review, regardless of
relevance to JFK assassination. In fact, most of the
material “used” in the review was used to determine if
information/names/etc. had been previously released and had
nothing to do with the assassination or investigations.

Also the part of the statement following “as well as” needs
clarification. Are they asking for all records that contain
information on individuals mentioned in assassination
records or are they asking for the records/indices/etc. that
were used to identify individuals mentioned by crypt or code
name in assassination records.

{ the amendment recommended by FBI covers CIA concerns;
ideally the word “used” should be changed to “created”]


1400.2 (continued)

(b) & (c) [ ok ]

(d) & (e) {add wording to identify time period for
‘these records such as “at the time of the assassination and
investigations” .]

1400.5 Requirement that assassination records be released in
their entirety.

An assassination record shall be disclosed in its
entirety except for portions specifically postponed...,and
no portions of any assassination records shall be withheld
from public disclosure solely on grounds of non-relevance.

{If this applies to an “individual” assassination record
then there is no problem. However, if it applies, as I :
suspect, to files and groups of records then we have a major
problem of privacy and source protection with the OP and 201
files. It may be possible to “postpone” the 201 and OP
files under the Privacy exemption and National Security Act,
however, the FBI approach to amending the regulation to deal
with “incidental appearance of assassination material” seems
a better approach. Our proposed amendment should include
“files” as well as “records”.

1400.6 Originals and Copies

(a) (2) add “available” after “the earliest generation
print”
: (b) in cases where a copy, as defined in paragraph (a)
of this section is authorized...the board may...require a
certified copy.

[In some cases our file copy or original is a previously
sanitized copy of the document; we may have to “certify”
theses copies as the “original” file copy.]

1400.7 Additional guidance

(d)...Any records identified with respect toa
particular person also includes any records for that person
by any other name, pseudonym, codeword, symbol, number or

cryptonym...

[This needs clarification. It the goal of this section is.
to ensure that all files on an individual/project are
provided regardless of how filed (under name, crypt, etc.)
then I do not see a problem. However, with out clarifying
language, this section could lead to the type of situation
described by Gloria. FBI also requested clarification.]


Issues:

Non-related (36,000+ pages) and OP (10,000 pages) material
in microfilm collection :

The “segregated” records statement negates our claim that
Material in the Microfilm is “non-related”. We can point
out that the HSCA requested, but did not review a lot of
these records and that access was given to complete files
even thought the request dealt with specific events or
timeframes. However, given their objective of going
“beyond” previous investigations, I not sure this would have
any impact.

A different approach would be to deny or postpone personnel
type files including 201s that are not related to the
assassination (guidelines to be established in consultation
with the Board) as unwarranted invasion of privacy and/or
protection of sources. Approximately 25,000 pages of the
Non-related material are from 201 files; the remaining
10,000+ pages are from organization and project files.

‘SUBJECT: Comments re Assassination Records Review Board's Interpretive
Regulations
1, [have reviewed the draft comments prepared for the Agency regarding the AARB’s proposed

interpretive regulations and believe some modifications are in order.

2. First and foremost, the comments regarding Section 1400.2 do not adequately address the concerns previously raised regarding the
unbridled inclusion of categories of records that have nothing to do with JFK's assassination, e.g., organization charts, records schedules,
filing systems, etc. This section should
> he limited to items created by agencies for use in the assassination review. Generic categories .
of information which stand alone on their merits should be included. This section is overly broad
and inclusive. (Please see the discussion in my 1 March memorandum.) Contrary to the proposed
comment that the intent of this section is “unclear”, { think it is eminently clear, and that's the problem.
I think our concerns would be better served by raising in terms of scope rather than intent. Also
recommend against asking questions such as “Is it the intent...2" Heck , yes! Would suggest wording
along the lines~"As presently worded, this section would appear to include....”

3. The proposed comment on Section 1400.7 opens the door to all records on a person vice those

relevant to the assassination inquiries. Do we really want to set ourselves up for the obvious response to the question we are asking?

There are a number of different points here that need to be clarified, all dealing with scope. The board's legitimate concern that all
records on an individual records be addressed (regardless of how filed, e.g.under another name, pseudonym, etc.}. And an equally
legitimate Agency concem that

1.) records on an individual when the records themselves are nat relevant to the assassination inquiry,

(ie. other records on the individual may be), or 2. ) that all records on individuals who merely happen

‘to be mentioned in a document falling within the scope of the assassination inquiry (but the individuals themselves are not the subject of
investigation} should not be subsumed within the scope of these

regulations.

satisfactorily limit the scope of this section). She does

Mr. David Marwell
Dear David,

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the
Assassination Records Review Board's proposed: interpretive
regulations as published in the Federal Register, February
8, 1995. We recognize the value of providing guidance for
those who are responsible for implementing’ the Assassination
Records Collection Act.

Our general view is that the regulations are
comprehensive in identifying the range of records that would
potentially be relevant to the JFK assassination or the
scope of the investigations into the assassination.

In a few sections of the regulations the wording seems
somewhat overly broad or the meaning is not clear. Attached
for the Board's consideration are comments on these
sections. In some parts of the text we suggest possible
changes in wording for purposes of clarification.

We would be pleased to discuss these comments at the
Board's convenience. It is our intention to continue
cooperating fully with the Board and to make every effort to
release assassination records held by the Agency.

John F. Pereira
Historical Review Group, CIA


Following are CIA's comments on specific sections of the
Assassination Records Review Board's interpretive
regulations, as published in the Federal Register, February
8, 1995.

1. Section 1400.1 Interpretation of Assassination Record

In paragraph (a) the reference to “activities and events
that may have led to the assassination--” seems overly
broad, and appears to go beyond the limits established in
the Assassination Records Collection Act. We believe that
it would be helpful to include an articuable standard in ,
this section. The present text would permit inconsistent
application of the regulations, which might encourage
massive and expensive, additional records searches that are
of doubtful value.

\

The following change is suggested in paragraph (a):

“activities and events that may reasonably be
considered. have led to the assassination--” (This would’
be Consistent with the Act.)

2. Section 1400.2 Interpretation of additional records and
information

Paragraph (a) raises a question as to the purpose and
definition of “additional records and information.” The
meaning of the phrase “all documents used--during
declassification review of assassination records as well as
all other documents--"seems unclear. Is it the intention to
include any document, book, index, record system, etc.
regardless of relevance to the assassination or
investigations, including for example, legal opinions ? We
assume that the purpose is to enable the Board to request
and review additional records.

We suggest that the section be made more specific,
including a clearer statement of the intent. For example,
with respect to cryptonyms, codewords, guides, etc. a more
precise link to events related to the assassination or to a
timeframe could be helpful.

3. Section 1400.5 Requirement that assassination records
be released in their entirety

The introductory paragraph specifies that “no portions
of any assassination record shall be withheld--solely on
grounds of non-relevance.” This appears to open the door
for access to entire documents that contain information on
sensitive activities even when the documents contain


information that is only incidental to the assassination,
such as a passing reference to a name. There is a potential
risk that sensitive, non-relevant sources and methods would
be compromised.

We suggest that the Board consider adding wording to this
section that accommodates those instances when there is a
need to release ample information from a document to
disclose assassination-related material, while still
protecting obviously unrelated, sensitive information. The
Board, of course, would continue to have access to the
entire record.

4. Section 1400.7 Additional guidance

Paragraph (d) states “any records identified with
respect to a particular person also includes any records for
that person by any other name, pseudonym, codeword,” etc.
This appears to require that all records on any individuals
who are merely mentioned in an assassination record be made
available. Is the objective really to assure that all files
on an individual or activity be made available regardless of
the labels on the files ? If so, we suggest that the text be
modified to reflect this.

Kennedy Assassination Records

Records Adsninistration (NARA). In
establishing 4 process fur public
disclosure of all records relating to tha
assassination, Congress crated an
independent Federal agency, the
Assassination Kecords Keview Board,
that consists of live citizens appointed
by the President and confirmed by thy
Sonate in 1494..Under the JFK Act, the
Raview Hoard ts unipowored to decide
“whether a record constitutes an
assassination record " 44 U S.C
2207.7(i)(4)(A). Congress intended that
the Review Board “issue puudance to

The Review Board's goal in issuing

in the assassination’s aftermath. The
Board recograzus thal many agencies
began to urpanizy and review records
responsive to the JFK Act even before
the Board was appointed and began its
work. Nevertheless. the Board's aim 1s

that this guidance will aid in the

which ended on March 10, 1995, for the
purpose of receiving wretien comments.
The Koview Board also heard testimony

of the propased interpretive tegulauuns
to agencies knuwn to have an interest in
and tu be affacted hy the Review Board's
work, paruculatly thoso that either

The Keview Board recenved written

regulations from four Faderal agencies,

proposed interpretive mgulations und
before oapiration uf the comment

comments received and the Review:
Board's responses thereto.

Comment. The proposed language of
§ 1400 1a) 15 unduly restrictive because
the phrase “may have led to the
assussination” requires at least a
potennal causal link to the
assassination Moreover, determining
whether there is @ causal link would

Jod tu the assascination of Prosidunt
Kounody

Response A nuinber of commentators
put forward cnticisins along thuse lines.
Soine of these commentators suggested.
that some form of a “reasonably related”
stondard be substituted for the “may
have led to” language, while others
suggested altemative formulations (e g ,
“that may shed light on the
assassination"). In adopting and
eventually applying a “reasonably
related" standard, the Review Board
does not seek to endorse or reject any
particular theory al the assassination of
President Kennedy, although such
theories may inform the Review Board's
soarch for records reasonably related to
the assassination and investigations into
it. The Keview Board beliuvus that
§ 1400.1(a}. as now wordud, advances
that elfurt and will promote a consistent
broad interpretation and
iunplemeutation of the JFK Act.

mmument: The proposud language of
§ 1400. 1{a) is tuo broad and open-ended.
A morn specific nexus to tho
assassination of Prusidont Kennedy
should bu requitod.

Response. As its text and legislative
history make clear, the JFK Act
contumpletes that the Review Bourd
extond its search for relevant records
buyond what has buen compiled oF
rovmewed by previous investigations It
is inuvituble, thorefore. that the Remew
Board must exercise judgment in
determining whether such records.
constitute “assassination records.” The
Review Board regards its “reasonably
related” standard os sulticieul to eusure
that agencies are not overburdened with
identifymg and reviewing records that,
tfaddad to the JFK Assassination
kecords Collection, wuuld not advance
tho purposes of the JFK Act

Conunent Secuon 1400 1 should
specifically include as assassination
recurds any recotds pertaining to
parucularly identified individuals,
organizutions, eveuts, ete

Response: Tue Review Board
dotermined that, sn almost overy case.
the types uf records commentators
sought toadd were already adequately
covered by § 1400.1 as proposed.
Accordingly, the Review Board duchned
to include rucords or record yroups at
the luvol of speciticity urged by these
commontatars because doing ro taght
limit the scopy of tho Interpretive
regulations as apphed iitially by other
agencies, of otherwise might prove
duplicative or confusing However, the
Review Board welcomes and encourages
suggestions frum the public as to
specific records or record groups that
mey constitute assassination records,
and intends to pursue such leads,

including those provided an thy written

communts to the proposed wterpretive

regulations

Comment: Section 1406 2(a) 15 vague
and overly broad in describing the scupe
of additional records and infurmatien

Hesponse The Review Buard has
added language to clarify that the
fouxpose of equesting addiuanal records
and information under § 1400.2(e) is to
identify, evaluat, or interpret
assassination records, uicluding
assassination records that may not
initially have been :dentified as such by
an agency The Review Hoard also has
addod languuge tu indicate that it
inteuds tw implement this section
through written requests signed by 11s
Executive Director. The Review Boand
contemplates that, with togard to such
requests, its staff will work clasely with
entitigs.to which such requests are
addrussed to implement the JFK Act
effectively and efficiently.

Comment. The scope of additional
tocords and information shuuld
specifically include records and
intormation that:

—desctibe agoncies’ metliods of
searching for records:

—describe reclassificauon, transfer,
destruction, ar uther disposition of
records; or

—do not constitute assassination
records, but have the potential tu
enhance, entich, and lrowden the
histurical record of the assassination.
Response. To the eatent that the

inclusion of records and information of

the types described would assist the

Review Board in meeting its

respunsibilities under the JFK Act, the

Review Board has adopted the suggested

language

Comment, The se

and “additional records and
informatiun” under § 1460.2 shuuld nat
extend to state and local govurnmunt or
to private records that are not in the
possession of the Federal yovernment

Response The Reviww Board
considered such comments careful
but concluded that the lerms of the JFK
Act preclude the narrower treading af
the Keview Bourd’s unsibilities
urged by such comments, Secuon
1400.6 allows the Review Board, ins
discretion, to scecpt cupies in hen of
rnals The Review Roard believes
this Heaibility addresses the
concerns of some commentators about
the removal uf original records already
housed. for example, en «tate or local
archives

Comment: Section 1400.3 should
include as sources of assassinauicn
records and additions! records and

infunnation individuals and
corporations that pussess such material
even af not obtained from sources
identified in paragraphs (a) through (0)
thereof, and should specifically include
individuals anid corporations that
cuntracted to provide goods of services
to the govertument.

Response: The Reviow Board has
added paragraph (0 to this section in.
response ta thyco comments. The
Review Board has concluded that, in
view of paragraph (f), speafically
identifying govemment conuactors or
other private persons would be
unnecessary and redundant.

Comment. NARA contendud that -

§ 1400.4 should not includy artifacts
among the types of materials included
in the term ““record."" Treating artifacts
as “records” would be contrary to
NARA‘s accustomed practice and the
usage uf the tenn “records” in ather
ereas of Federal records law and would
sesult in substantial practical
difficulties.

Hesponse: The Review Board has
catolully considered NARA’s objectivas
to the inclusion of artifacts as “records,”
but decided chat this inclusion is
necessary ta achieve the purposes of the
JFK Act. The Review Board notes that
artifacts that bocame exhibits to the
proceedings of the Warren Coinnusston
man (n the custady uf NAKA,
and decided! that theso artifacts shuuld
remain in the JFK Assassination Records
Collection. The Revicw Hoard further
hultevos that the unique issues of public
trust and credibility uf government
prucesses that prompted enactment of
thy JFK Act require that aru facts be
included within tha JFK Assassination
Records Collectiun. Tho strong support
that commenting mambers of the public
gave to this position reinforces this
conclusion. The Review Board sncluded
1n its proposed regulauons, and retained
in 9 1400.7(b)—{(c} of the final
interpretive regulavons, lauguage
intended to address NARA‘s concerns
about potential copying requirements
and preservation issues unique to
artifacts.

Comment: Section 1400.5 should be
iudified to allow agencies to withhold
from the JFK Assassination Record
Collection material that ts nat rulated to
the assassination of President Kunnedy,
oven though st appoars in & record that
contains othec material that 1s related to
tho wssassination of President Kennedy.

Response: It remains the intent of this
section to make cleat to agencies that, a8
anule, entire records, and not parts
thereof, are to become part of the jFK
Assassination Records Collections The
purpose of requiring thet records be
produced in thear entirnty is to ensure

Circumstances, this determinstion is

Comment: Tho discussion of originals
and copies in § 1400.6 is, in vorious:

Response: The Review Board made
extensive changos to this suction to
address thase concems and to achieve
greater internal consistency. The Review
Board's intent in this section is to
express its strong preference for
including original records in the JFK.

also its understanding thet, for a vocily
of reasons, thute may be situ

Comment: Section 1400.6 should be
clarified as to whether “record copies”
‘of Fodoral agency may be included 1n
the JFK Assassination Records
Collection.

Response: The Keview Board has

Comment: The Catalog of

agencies in possession of assassination
records.

Response: This and other comments
received regarding the pruposed
§ 1400.4 indicated some confusion us tu
the Intent and opsration of the
mechanism establishud in this section
For this reason, the Review Board
decided to replace the term “Catalog ul

subparograph (f) was added after

The Review Board has added language

internal consistency. The Review Board
also mncorporated in the final
interpretive regulations language
clarifying that “record copies” of
Federal agency records may be included

Collectiun and addressing the important
issue of pressrvatton requirements. In
this respect, the Review Hoard sought to
treat records in various media in a
means appropriate to the unique
cheracteristics of each medium.

Additional Guidance

Review Baard extensively revised

of the labals on the files, where the
records may be found, or whether they
reflect the true name or identifier uf the

‘Subparagraphs (b) and (c) § 1400.7
were included in thy propusud
interpretive regulations and retained in
the final interpretive rogulouions in
order to address concerns oxpressed by
NARA regarding the inclusion of
artifacts in the scope of the material
doomad “assassination records.” Ry
including these subparagraphs, thy
Review Board wishes ta make St claar
that it believes the JFK Act wstablishes
unique standards as to tho records to be
included in the JFK Assassination
Kecords Collection. By including
artifacts as a typo of “assassination
record,” the Review Board seeks tu
fulfill ats mandate from Congress to
assemble all materials reasunably
related to the assassination «n the JFK
Assassination Records Collection. It is
not untundyd that the inclusion here of
artifacts for purposes of implementing
tho JFK Act should be construed to
affect the umplemyntetion of uther
tacords laws. Subparazraph (¢) is
intended Lo onsure that all artifacts an
the collection are preservud for posterity
and that public accass be provided to
those artufacts in a magnner consistent
with their pruservation. The Review

CAA Requirements and EPA Actions
Concerning Designation and
Classification

Section 107(d)(4) ot the Clean Air Act
as amended in 1990 (CAA) required the
‘States and EPA to designate areas as
attainment, nonatteinment, or
unclassifiable for yzone ag wall as athor
pollutants for which netronal ambient
air quality standards (NAAQS) have

_ been set. Section 161(a}(1) (table 1)

required that ozone nonattainment areas
be classified as marginal, moderate,
serious, severe, or extreme, depen
on their air quality.

In a series of Federal Register notices,
FPA completed this process by
designating and classifying all areas of
tho country fur ozone. See, c.g. 56 FR
58694 (Nov. G, 1991); 57 FR 56762 (Nuv.
30, 1992); 59 FR 18967 (Apnil 21, 1994)

discussion of the attainment dates is

(tha General Pruambla),

‘The Hancock and Waldo Counties,
Molnu atoa was designated
nonattainment and Classified marginal
for ozune pursuant to 56 FE 54094 (Nov.
&, 1991). By this classificauion, its
attanment date became Novetnher 15.

CAA Requirewents and EPA Actions
Concerning Meeting the Attainment
Date

Suction 181(b7KA) raquires the
Administrator, within six months of the
attainment date, to determine whether
ozone nonattanment areas attained the
NAAQS For yzune, EPA detormines
attainment status on the basis of the
expected number of exceedances ol the
NAAQS over tho three-year period up
to, and including. the attainment date.
See General Preamble, 57 FR 13360 Tn
the case of ozone manginal
nonattomnment atoas, tho three yoor
period is 1991-93. CAA section
181(U)(2)(A) further states Unat, fur areas
classified as maninal, moderate, or
serivus, if the Administrator determines
that the area did not attain the standard
by tts attainmont date, the area must be
reclassified upwards.

However. CAA section 181{a){3)
