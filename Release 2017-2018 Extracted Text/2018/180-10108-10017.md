C0-2-32682

DATE: November 23, 1962

FROM : SA Charlie Taylor - WFO

SUBJECT: Cuban Plot to Assassinate President Kennedy

At 9:00 p.m. on Vovember 21, 1962, I picked up an original letter

from a Mr. Antonio Rodriguez,

driver for the Venezuelan Delegation

to the International erican Defense Board, 2335 Ashmead Place N. ir.

Washington, D. C.

working with me in this case for the Federal Bureau of Investigation

are SA L. B. ilchonald and Joseph Scullay who may call you regarding this letter

or other material relating

to this case.

The investigation has disclosed that the leteer vas mis-sent by the

Post Office Department and ve are presently crying to find out if there is

an Antonio Rodriguez here in Washington that was the intended recipient

of this letter.

The letter was addressed to Antonio Rodréguez 0246 7 N.W.: 11432 Se.

Nashington, D. C. postmarked Havanna, Cuba, November 14, 1962. As translated

by SA McDOnald, FBI, letter reads as follows:

Comrad Rodreguez

In accorjance with the

planning and insistent attitude of Kennedy

to

invade Cuba carry out the criminal attempt againse this Person in

the terms made.. I won't give you more instructions because it is not necessary,

all that you have

to know

vou

already know, and for its own security

and effoctivoness of the planning, I comply thus wich superior orders.

I

have not had means of cammunicating this vich you hy any other safer means,

For that reason I did it in this letter. In the United states they are not in the

habit of opening lottors for

that reason i trust everything will go well. A

good communist has to run chese risks.

We have to count on our pin

These are things of a high level that a good communist of action can't discuss

nor dount.. If lic does it that way it will he for the rood of all communists

The news that. I will send you if I an able (will be) by a far safer

nethod. Answer me

soon. I am embracing you.

Pope

The FDI has alvised that a number of possible associations of

Antonio Rodreguez will be forchcoming and these should be cross reference

to the file.

Plot to Assassinate the President

This will confirm my telephone conversation with you on

November 27, at which time I acquainted you with the background

of this case and identified to you as a suspect Antonio Rodriguez

y Jones (Cuban National; male, age 19; 5-6; 170; black kinky hair;

brown skin; resides Granite State Apartments,_ apartment 203,

1731 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.). I informed

son of Antonio Rodriguez y Eschazabal,

former Cuban Ambassador to Pakistan, who is a self-avowed defector

to the west and who presently resides in washington, D.C.,

probably at 1638 R Street, N.W.

Informed you that on October 28, when young Rodriguez

left employment at the Georgetown Inn in the District of Columbia,

he professed to the company's auditor his pro-Castro attítude

and stated that he was

leaving this employment to go to New York

to join Castro's "Army."

It was requested that you seek, through any rellable infor

mants, to learn whether there has been any rumor of plotting such

as our investigation indicates but that for the present you keep

concealed from outsiders our interest in these persons.

You were

informed that both of these persons are currently in' Washington,

D.C., and that our principal interest in communicating with you

by telephone was to alert you to the investigation in progress.

Since the telephone call, surveillance disclosed that on

November 28, at about 11:05 A.M., four male persons were observed

arriving at and entering what we believe to be the residence

location of the elder Rodriguez at 1638 R Street, N.W., Washington,

These visitors, who are colored, were well dressed and

were observed to alight from a late-model Buick LeSabre, 4-door

sedan, bearing New York license plates 605419. It is requested

that you initiate investigation to determine registration infor-

mation on this plate number and advise us.

For your information, and not to be exhibited at this time

outside the Service, there are enclosed three photographs:

At the home of 1-15-45, it was learned that at approximately

10:15 A.M. that day a telephone call was received from Informant

1-15-47

who related that a chauffeur employed for the Venezuelan

Delegation of the Inter-American Defense Board had seen a letter

which involved a plot to assassinate President Kennedy Fearing

that the Chief of

the Delegation, Colonel lugo Inece, was involved

In the plot, the incident was reported to I-15-47 requesting advice

in the matter and what action should be taken to advise. the proper

United States officials.

After 1-15-47

he checked

back with the chauffeur to insure that the letter

would be given to the U. S. Secret Service for investigation.

This chauffeur, Antonio Rodriguez y. Gil, stated that the letter

was received in

the morning mail at approximately 8:00 A.M.. that

day, and that since contacting 1-15-47 he had made inquiries among

members of the Venezuelan. Delegation and had decided to turn the

letter over to an official of the Delegation for possible referral

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

7:30 P.M.

Through the lashington City Directory it was ascertained

that Antonio Rodriguez y Gil resided at 2335 Ashmead Place, N.W.,

Washington, D.C., Telephone No. Hobart 2-9170.

called and

arrangements were made for an interview later that

evening.

It was ascertained from 1-15-45 that Antonio Rodriguez Gil's

supervisor, Colonel Hugo Trego, had been under investigation for

sometime in connection with certain reported associations with

Communist groups in Venezuela; also, the possibility existed that

Trego had been involved in attempts

to obtain a change in the

reasons that 1-15-45 advised that Trego could not be trusted.

letter was received at the Venezuelan Delegation at 12:00 Noon

that day and was opened by cod. Trego at 1:00.P.M (this differs

from the information received from Antonio Rodriguez GId In that

he reported the letter was received at 8:00 A.M. and was opened

shortly after being received in

the morning mail).

During the course of the evening and interrogation of Col.

Trego, Antonio Rodriguez, et al, the following were present:

Lt. Jacob Breckman and Sgt. Robert Gray (Detective) of No. 13

Precinct; Special Agents L. B. McDonald and Joseph Sculley of the

FBI; and jose Valado, translator, Venezuelan Delegation.

Duriation with

During the evening, the letter was translated by. Col. Irego,

FBI. Subsequently, on November 26, 1962, the letter was shown

to SA Victor J. Gonzalez of this Service

and following is the

translation which SA Gonzalez furnished:

"Comrad Rodreguez,

"In accord with the planning and obstinant attitude

of Kennedy to invade Cuba carry out the attempt on his

life in the terms conceived.

Iam not giving you more

data because it is not necessary since all that you have

to know you know, and for its own security and effective-

ness of

the planning I comply thus with superior orders.

"I have had no other way of communicating this to

you by any other safer means, for that reason I had to

do it by letter.

In the U. States they are not in habit

of

opening the letters for that reason I trust everything

will

go.well...A good communist has to run these risks.

We have to count on our own energeys because USSR has

not adopted a solid position with Cuba..

These are high

level questions that a good communist (card carrying)

should not question.

"If he does it in that way it will be for the good

of all conmunist that are in the world. Cuba is not all.

Enough already has been done by Cuba.

"I will send you the next news if I am able by a

far safer method. Give me a prompt answer. I am

embracing you.

Pepe"

The envelope, written in English, was postmarked Havana,

Cuba, 9:00 A.M., November 14, 1962, and bore the address 9246 ? N.W.

During the course of the interrogation of Antonio Rodriguez

Gil and members of the Venezuelan Delegation by the reporting

special agent and representatives of the FBI and Metropolitan

Police Department, efforts were made to determine if any

address

existed in Washington, D.C., which would in any way tie in with

the address on the envelope of this letter.

It appeared strange,

indeed, that a conspirator involved

in a plot to take the life

of the President would not know how to contact a co-conspirator.

Although the writer of this letter indicates some knowledge of

the United States customs, he apparently is confused as to the

proper procedure employed by the Post Office in directing mail

in view of the fact that two addresses which are non-existent

appear on the envelope.

No information could be developed during

this investigation which would in any way clarify this grossly

inaccurate address.

Information was developed from Antonio Rodriguez Gil and

code Hugo Trego that Gil was born on July 1, 1931, 1n Galesia,

e as described as white: male: SDanish. 5-6: 154. brow

hair (shaved to the

scalp with bald patches). Gil left Spain and

traveled to Venezuela in 1952, was married there in 1957 to

Delores Valado, and worked in Caracas with the Columbian Embassy.

In 1956 he Decame a Venezuelan citizen, Passport #019965, and that

same year came to the United States.

His citizenship status was

temporary and when he traveled to the United States he lost this

status and is no longer a citizen of Venezuela.

In 1958, in the

United States, he obtained a position with the Venezuelan Delega-

tion to the Inter-American Defense Board.

Gil claimed

he has never

traveled to or

resided in Cuba.

During the interrogation, it was learned that approximately

three months ago Gil received a letter from the Central Office

of Safeway Stores, Inc.?

was shown a check

payable to Safeway from an Antonio Rodriguez,

drawn on Riggs Bank. : A micro-film strip of this check was pro-

jected and on examining the signature Gil immediately observed

that it was not his but probably that of some other Antonio

Rodriguez. Gil was of the opinion that the check was drawn at

the 18th and Columbia Branch of Riggs Bank.

It was also learned during interrogation, from Jose valado,

that approximately two months ago, while attending the Americani

zation School, 19th and California Streets, N.W., he recalled a

student there by the name of Antonio Rodriguez; that this man was

in his early 30's; 5-1 in height; slender build; very light skin;

black hair; and married.

(b.) GENERAL INQUIRIES:

On November 22, 1962, 1-15-5 advised that Colonel Hugo Trego

was presently, under investigation for possible subversive ties in

the United States; further, there had been reports concerning his

been working through intermediaries to

increase his position of power with the Venezuelan Government, and

a possibility exists that he has been involved in recent efforts

to depose the current leaders in that government.

1-15-5 further advised tha one Antonio Rodriguez Jones had

been contacted by

pro-Castro Cubans known to have been involved in

acts of violence in the United States, and that further details of

these incidents would be furnished at

a later date.

On November 23, 1962, Mr. Carl Malone, Superintendent, Inquiry

and Claims, Dead Letter Section, Main Post Office, Washington, D.C.,

was contacted through Postal Inspector Joseph Verant.

It was

pointed out to Mir. Malone that the address, 9246 ? N.W. and 11432

St., USA, on the envelope in question was crossed out in red ink

and on the bottom was written No. 953 and the address of Antonio

Rodriguez Gil, 2335 Ashmead Place,

.N.W., Washington, D.C. Mr. Malone

explained that

the Post Office furnishes

a registry service for any

mail originating from a foreign country that is improperly addressed.

particular case, Mrs. Elizabeth Acree looked in the Washington

Directory and

found the only Antonio Rodriguez listed, and wrote

the address, 2335 Ashmead Place, N.W., on the envelope with a note

that the postman should try that address.

A search was initiated through the foreign and local Dead

Letter Sections of the Post Office for any mail addressed

to

Antonio Rodriguez, with negative results.

As per request,

Mr. Malone placed

a flag in his files and if any letter is

received in his section addressed to Antonio Rodriguez, this

Service will be immediately advised.

On November 23, 1962, Mrs. Cora Beasly, D. C. Board of Educa-

tion, John Quincy Adams School (Americanization School), 19th and

a search was initiated in an effort to determine whether she had

any students by the name of Antonio Rodriguez. Mrs. Beasly advised

that no current students by that name are on the rolls of that

school; however, in 1959 there was an Antonio Rodriguez listed,

age 50, address

unknown.

In view of the fact that Antonio Rodriguez is a very comnon

Latin American name, efforts were immediately commenced to deter

mine the number of Individuals in the washington, D.C., area with

that name, and whether or not agencies engaged in conducting

investigations on individuals involved in subversive activities

would show a record for any of these persons.

On November 23 and during the week of November 26, 1962,

1-15-5 furnished information concerning Antonio Rodriguez Jones

and his possible association with jose Moleon Carrerarand Quinton

Pino Machado

Carrera ostensibly is a Military Adviser to the

Cuban Delegation to the Organization of American States and works

with the Cuban Delegation through the Inter-American Defense

Board. Both he and Machado, who is known as the "hatchet man"

for the Cuban Embassy in Washington, have been involved in acts

of violence, including beatings and abductions of defectors from

Communist Cuba.

According to 1-15-5, in August of 1961, one Felipe Martinez

y Rivere was abducted by a group of Cuban Communists in the United

states after it was learned that Martinez was severing all ties

with Communist Cuba.:

Martinez was taken to Baltimore,

1-15-5 learned that the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations,

on October 4, 1961, had requested that subject be contacted

through the Organization of American States, requesting that he

furnish the Cuban Government with information concerning schooling.

It was further learned by 1-15-5 that on June 20, 1961, the

subject was observed making pro-Castro remarks to members of his

class while attending the Institute of Modern Languages, 1322 M

Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.; further, that the subject was

quite frequently with Martinez prior to

Martinez' defection to the

United States. When the subject learned that the Cuban Embassy

in Washington, D.C., was interested in the whereabouts of Martinez,

he reported whatever information he had to Quinton Pino Machado

who was then acting as an alternate representative to the Organiza-

tion of American States with Jose Moleon Carrera.. It was further

learned that in December 1960 the subject had a Communist publica-

tIon delivered to his residence in washington, D.C.

In addition,.

November 1960 concerning the whereabouts of Martinez.:

I-15-5 received information that Captain Jose Moleon Carrera

was active In New York City in December 1961 in selecting and

training 15 pro-Castro Cubans for undercover work in the United

States.

Following his activity in New York, Moleon, accompanied

by an individual of unknown identity, left the United States for

Cuba and they were expected to return to the United States in a

very short period of time.

1-15-5 furnished the current address of subject as The Granite

State Apartments, 1731 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington,

D.C., Apt. No. 203. Information was also transmitted that photo-

graphs of subject and members of his family had been taken and

efforts would be made to obtain copies for this Service.

On November 24, 1962, an effort was made to determine the

maker of the check with an account at Riggs Bank which had been

charged to Antonio Rodriguez Gil's account through the Safeway

Store at 18th and Columbia Road,

It was learned that it is

the policy of the Riggs Bank not to furnish information concerning

depositors without a subpoena. Mr. D. E. Wisecarver,

Vice Presi

dent and Manager of the Riggs Bank at Isth and Columbia Road, M.v.,

inquired of the Central Depositor Listing and established that the

Dupont Circle Branch had two Antonio Rodriguez' listed; however,

it would be necessary to obtain information concerning these

depositors from the Cashier of Riggs Bank, John C. McCormick, in

the absence of a subpoena.

Mr.

McCormick was telephoned and he advised that representa-

tives of 1-15-5 had previously made inquiry concerning this matter

and information was furnished them that the Dupont Circle Branch

has

two Antonio Rodriguez! - one, Antonio Rodriguez Gil (the

recipient of this letter) and another Antonio Rodriguez who does

not have a Washington, D.C., address but lists an address in a

foreign country:

Mr. McCormick suggested that since the original

contact with the Riggs Bank was made by a representative of 1-15-5,

the Riggs Bank be again contacted by 1-15-5 as additional infor-

mation was in existence concerning the present location of the

other depositor named Antonio Rodriguez. 1-15-5 was advised of

Mr. McCormick's request.

On November 26, 1962, contact was made with 1-15-9 in an

effort to determine the background on Antonio Rodriguez Jones and

members of his family.

It was learned that the subject's father,

Antonio Rodriguez y Echazabal, wished to defect to the United

States at the time of the Punta del Esta Conference.

He previously

had fought with Fidel Castro during the revolution for a period of

approximately three years, and after Castro had obtained

control

of Cuba had been appointed to diplomatic posts in Haiti, Pakistan,

and Guatemala®

During these periods he had been known to associate

with pro-Communist groups frequently. In April 1962, he and his

son, Antonio Rodriguez Jones, were observed in Guadalupe, Mexico.:

Although the subject's father had expressed anti-Castro sentiments

recently, 1-15-9 is of the opinion that he cannot be frusted because

of his past close association with Communist groups.

they will give you the instructions which they have

received through the appropriate channels. Your

tactics should be to continue demonstrating yourself

as anti-Communist, more specifically anti-Castro, as

you have. Up to now you have played your role very

way, are you already spealing over the radio against

Long live World Revolution.

On dictating these orders

I am carrying out direct orders of Fidel."

There is every indication, from information and reports

extant, that Carlos Meneses is not known at P. 0. Box 347 in

guatemala City and that, consequently, the letter was intercepted

and turned over toa person of authority in the Guatemalan Govern-

ment.

Intelligence sources in Guatemala City indicate that reneses

was a mayor of the departmental capital of Chimaltenango and was

elected and served as a member of the government's Executive Com-

of 1-15-9 and the original letter is being used by the government

of Guatemala in their current investigation.

During this current phase of the investigation of Antonio

Rodriguez y Jones, information was developed by 1-15-17 concerning

On December 14, 1962, Mr. Irby Todd of the Office of the

examiner of Questzoned Documents, Ireasury Department, made a

preliminary examination of the Iirst and second letters anc

disclosed that they were of common authorship.

In examining the

specimens of the handprinting avallable, reported to have been

executed by Jose Menendez y

Kamos, Examiner Todd furnished the

opinion that in all probability these were not specimens of Ranos!

handwriting but rather that someone had prepared these forms on

which the handprinting appears for Ramos.

In studying the hand-

writing of Ranos, Mr. Todd disclosed that Ramos is capable of

writing and printing in an above-average style.

A further examination will be made by the EQD in Washington,

D.C., when all specimens of Ramos handwriting have been received.

Informant 1-15-48 was contacted and disclosed nothing of inter-

est which would contribute to this investigation. All contacts

observed y: 1-15-40 between the subject, Antonio Rodriguez Jones,

and Others have been in connection with

the pursuance of better

employment and with personal friends on which there is no deroga-

tory information

On December 12, 1962, Informant 1-15-49 was interviewed con-

cerning the subject and whatever background information could be

obtained relative to members of the subject's family.

1-15-49 indicated that subject's father, Antonio Rodriguez E

Echazabal,. was well known by officials in the Cuban government,

both before and after the Castro revolution.

He recalled that

the subject's lather was engaged as a butcher (owned a meat store)

in Haiti and that when Castro came into power the elder Rodriguez

walked into the Cuban Embassy in Haiti and advised that he was the

new Ambassador. In 1959 there were reports that the elder Rodri-

guez had shot and killed an individual associated with an anti-

Castro group. Since that time he has been held in very low esteem

by groups involved in anti-Castro activities.

Approximately three months ago, 1-15-49 was contacted by the

elder Rodriguez, requesting that efforts be made to obtain a visa

waiver for nis mother, Christina Echazabal y Socas, who is

presently in Cuba. At that time he exhoited to 1-15-49 a large

roll of 100-pesos notes of the series that were used for monetary

exchange in Cuba prior to the recent devaluation by Castro.

He

complained to 1-15-49 that he had considerabie amounts of these

notes and that they were of practically no value.

1-15-49 furnished the information that the subject, Antonio

lodrigues Jones, was not known ta the cuban comunity. However,

information was received that there is a possibility that subject

may be a member of the revolutionary organization presently under

the leadership of an individual known as Sera (1-15-5 advises

that this was in all probability a Jose Sera and is making an

effort to determine whether or not the subject is a member of

this group).

1-15-49 knew of the infamous reputation of Jose Moleon Carrera

and Quinton Pino lachado, that both of these individuals were

menbers of the inter American Defense Board and the Organization

of American States; and that Moleon lived and operated out of the

Cuban Embassy from January 1961 to January 1962 in a clandestined

manner. 1-15-49 knows of no association between the subject and

these two individuals.

When 1-15-49 was questioned concerning his knowledge of acts

of violence by pro-castro groups in the United States, he recalled

that approximately our weeks ago Dr. jose Miro Cardona, head of

the Cuban Revolutionary Council, was almost killed by a pro-Castro

revolutionary group. He had driven his car to his home and

approximately one hour after he entered his home his car was blown

up by a bomb which was ser on the fender. 1-15-49 advised that

both inside and outside of the United States, are capable of any

acts of violence and have been known to purposely have directed

communications to anti-Castro groups for reasons of harassment and l

to cause difficulty for these individuals.

:1-15-49 knew of a Jose Menendez who was employed with the

Institute of National Agrarian Reform and is presently occupying a

very important position with the castro government.

He could fur

In addition, he indicated that he would

in an effort to obtain more background information on the subject.

Through Mr. James F. Greene, Deputy Associate Connissioner,

Domestic Control, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washing-

ton, D.C., arrangements were made for the subject to be called into

the

Innigration and Naturalization Field Office for reinterviaw.

On December I2, 1962, the reporting special agent posed as

an Innigration and Naturalization investigator and was assisted

by William B. Dinwiddie, Jr. Investigator, INS, at which time a

signed, sworn deposition was obtained from the subject covering

his interrogation. It appeared very unusual that the subject and

his father took no steps to obtain clarification of their Immigra-

Cubar Embassy; that he had visited the Cuban Embassy on a number of

occasions while his father was in the diplomatic corps for fidel

Lastro; and that he nad purposely fled to officials in the Cuban

Encassy in order to protect his father.. The subject admitted no

present involvement with any group or organization and indicated

allegiance to the American principles and his desire to remain in

the United States.

On Decenber 13g. 1952, the subject was accompanied by his

father, to whom he read the deposition. The elder Rodriguez Indi

cated he was in agreement with the statements his son made con-

cerning his allegiance to the United States and offered his assis-

tance to the Immigration & Naturalization Service.

He admitted

that he was presently working with a group to effect the overthrow

of the government in Haiti by peaceful means.

No mention was made in this dispatch

of the interest of the Secret Service of that any previous letters

It now appears that a pattern has been established relating

to the addressing and delivery of these letters under investigation.

In view of the fact that the subject had indicated to

made with INS authorities to have the

In the cuban Embassy, or

representatives of Fidel Castro, the reason for his leaving

employ of the Georgetown Inn, and other matters which would more

clearly establish the subject's current political philosophy.

1-15-5 has advised that all of the Antonio Rodriguez' in

Washington, D.C., have been checked and that the subject, Antonio

Rodriguez Jones, is still the best possible suspect as the intended

recipient of letter #l.

The letter referred to in Page 16 of MiR of reporting agent,

dated lovember 30, 1962, postmarked Favana, Cuba, November 21, 1962,

bears in the return address the name, Enrique Perez. Cobian, which

has been associated as a relative to the subject's sister-in-law,

Maria Perez Cobian, nee de Rodriguez.

It now appears that the second letter concerning the cuban

plot to assassinate the President was obviously misdirected;

further, that from similarity of words and phrases in the general

context

the second letter is associated with the first and may have

been authored by the same

person or group.

In the light of this recent development, every effort will

be

If such is true, the sender would know full well that the letters

Nationalist Party movement.

Information developed during

these interviews, studies made during the investigation of

the Cuban plot to assassinate the President, and subsequent

briefings by representatives of the Federal

Bureau of Investi

gation and Central Intelligence Agency has provided a basis

for making a judgment on the overall situation in Haiti.

Recent trends have demonstrated the cleverness of the

Russian Communists in infiltrating Haiti, with the collabora-

tion of the dictators, Duvalier and Castro. This has had an

impact on the political situation of nations in the Caribbear

area and has triggered a chain reaction of violence and

unrest among the Latin American element.

Unlike most

segments of the world population, the

Haitians are a mixture of Spanish, Italians,

Germans,

Portugese who have intermarried with the Africans and the

Indians• With so many diverse backgrounds it is very diffi-

cult to accurately project what will happen in any given

situation.

In addition to the Cuban influence, Communist

Chinese and the Russians are vying for power and acceptance

of their ideologies.

This is a large, semi-trained,

an armed mob which would be extremely dangerous to the public

order in time of stress. Duvaller, in spite of criticism.

from countries in Latin

America and from the United States,

is strengthening the potential of the militia.

The group of Haitians in Cuba are also making inroads

into a number of different government agencies.

Through

Communist Herve Boyer, Minister of Finance of Haiti, and

Communist Jules Blonchet, Chief of the Budget,

cells have

been formed which are strengthening the Communist influence.

Native-language radio propaganda is being beamed from Cuba,

creating a strong undercurrent of anti-American sentiment.

The Haitians are very easily influenced due to the high

illiteracy rate (90%), thus they do not have the ability to

properly rationalize this propaganda.

Anti-American sentiment is also occasioned by a long-

standing resentment of the occupation of the United States

Marines in Haiti.

The Haitians also feel that the United

States Government is very closely allied with Duvalier and

has not taken the necessary steps to help depose him..

Recent events in Cuba have caused Castro to lose some

prestige among the Haitians and because of his close ties with

Francois Duvalier the Haitian government is in trouble.

Economically, the government has demonstrated serious

deficiencies, causing extreme poverty and unrest. This,

important Latin American Government allies do not recognize

the last presidential election, has seriously damaged

Duvalier's prestige.

•It does not seem likely that the Communists have acquired

enough strength and prestige to take over the government of

Haiti at this time.

If a takeover were effected by the

Communists, it would, in all probability, be an internal matter

without a revolution. Because of the infiltration into the

police force by the Communists, the government's discipline

would immediately be placed into effect.

In the event that the underground movement currently

underway should be successful in deposing Duvalier, opposition

groups have planned to establish a provisional government.

The presence or lack of chaos or bloodshed would depend on

whether a strong government would be in control of Haiti with

a planned program that has the support of the United States

Government and influential Latin American nations.

A number of opposition groups have been formed, headed

by former leaders of Haiti.

None of these groups have, at

present, enough

strength to dominate the underground resis-

tance movement.

However, the Haitian National Party (Parti-

National) has the appearance of the most powerful and best

organized group. This party was formed by Clement Jumelle in'

the late 1940's and has received support from a number of

different sources.

In rigging the election of Duvalier.

Senator Louis DeJoire. In the spring of 1959, with the

sanction of the Cuban Government, Senator DeJoire trained a

group of Haitians for an invasion of Haiti. When Duvalier

heard of this he dispatched Rene Depestre to Cuba. After

conferences with Ernesto "Che" Guevarra, DeJoire was ordered

to disband his

group and became persona non grata in Cuba.

He is presently living in exile in either Baltimore or New

York CIty•

Representatives of these groups are currently meeting

in New York in an effort to present a united front in the

underground movement to depose Duvalier.

Difficulty has been

encountered inasmuch as most of the individuals mentioned are

attempting to become leaders themselves.

Recent developments in these Haitian opposition activities

are of particular import to this Service because Antonio

Rodriguez Echazabal is actively engaged in overthrowing the

regime of Duvalier.

Echazabal married a Jamaican and settled in Haiti in

1942. By 1948 he opened a meat market there, trading as

Osoblonko. This was a very successful business and over a

period of years he cultivated a number of friends among

persons in positions of influence in Haiti. He was and is

known as Osoblonko by his friends and leaders in the oppo

sition movenent®

In 1959, former Dictator Trujillo of the Dominican Republic

tried to assassinate Osoblonko, then the Cuban Ambassador In

or public

haiti.

A hand grenade was tossed into the car in which

Osoblonko was riding and he quickly picked it up and threw it

out before it exploded. A few days later, Duvalier sent three

men with machine guns to ambush osoblonko.

They opened fire

on Osoblonko while he was riding in his official limousine

and his chauffeur was killed, however, he escaped unharmed.

This incident made him a bitter enemy of Duvalier.

While still Cuban ambassador to Haiti, Osoblonko assisted

Clement Jumelle, a political prisoner of Duvalier, in escaping

The opposition activities of soblonko have taken a

very unusual turn recently.

He has not affiliated himself

with any legitimate opposition group.

He has been seen with

employed in the Pan American Union).

ment and is considered a competent administrator.

activities are suspect by members of these opposition groups.

Recently, Osoblonko was reported to have taken a trip to Miami,

Florida.

The reason for this trip and the individuals he met

are not known at this time..

We will continue to look into this matter as it relates

to the activities of Antonio Rodriguez Echazabal and keep you

advised of any future developments.

On February 26g 1963, SA Charles E. Taylor had another

briefing-with the Central

Intelligence Agency inasmuch as

this Haitian situation is very fluid.

Pierre R. Bazile, who is currently employed with the

Organization of American States, is a CIA contact.

The CIA

considers him a very high caliber individual, trustworthy anc

honest.

Among the number of important positions he held with

the Haitian Government was that of Supervisor of the National

Lottery.

In connection with that position, Bazile had an

opportunity to further his financial interests if he were

inclined to be dishonest; however, such was not the case and

he is very poor.

Bazile reportedly turned down a lucrative

postion with the United Nations because he feels that he can

provide better service in his present position.

A new opposition group has recently been formed with the

avowed purpose of overthrowing the regime of Duvalier in

Haiti.

This group is headed by Osoblonko (Antonio Rodriguez

take an active part in this situation in the very near

Osoblonko has claimed that he has a cache. of arms

and ammunition in Martinique, France, that can be placed at

the disposal of this group.

very near future in which Osoblonko will accompany two

individuals, representing an unknown element that has

expressed an interest in backing the new opposition group.

The itinerary of this trip is reported to be San Juan,

Santo Domingo, and Martinique.

In the more than 20 years soblonko has associated

himself with Haitians he has developed a number of good con

tacts.

He is particularly well known among the mulatto

elite

in Haiti.

In his position as ambassador to Guatemala

and Pakistan for the Castro Government, he was actively

involved in pro-Communist activity with the satellite nations.

for the Castro Government and other valuable information that

would be of assistance to the United States. He has not been

used as a contact by the CIA because of his past history and

his close ties with Fidel Castro. On February 20, 1962, he

was in Martinique, France, and on April 6, 1962, he was

Guadalupe and San

Juan.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently checking

to determine the nature of Osoblonko's recent visit to Miami,

Florida.

It is believed that he has had previous contact

with Prio Soccaras, the former President of Cuba, and Manuel

Artime:

brigade commander representing the Cuban Council.

There is reported to have been a recent rift between leaders

of the Cuban Brigade. Osoblonko may attempt to exploit this

situation.

We will continue to look into this matter as it relates

to the activities.of Antonio Rodriguez Echazabal and keep you

advised of any future developments.

Reference is made to my memorandum submitted February 29,

interviews is set forth below.

During the past sonth, Osoblonko (Antonio Rodrizuez

chazabal)yhas Increased his activities with the new oppo-

SaTion group. He is presently in San Juan, Puerto Rico,

awaiting a visa for travel to the Dominican Republic. There

he plans to assume command of the operation of the opposition

apparatus which has been set up in the Dominican Republic.

Le intends to use this apparatus in a "takeover" of the

covernment of Haiti.

The exact neans he will enploy to bring

this about is not known at this time.

While in the process of forming this new opposition

group, Osoblonko made the following staterents to representa-

tives of the Nationalist Party of laiti and other groups

operating in the United States who are working toward the

overthrow of the present regine in Haiti:

I. Fis group is sponsored by the American Government

Investigation by the Nationalist Party of Haiti disclosed

that Osoblonko deliberately lied when he made the statements

cited above in an attempt to gain stature with the opposition

groups and create an impression that he has important influ

ertial backing.

Dr. Artine was at Panana City, Panana, from

February 24 to 25, 1963, and on his return stated he did not

know Osoblonko and, further, wanted nothing to do with him.

Neither Rigaud nor

General Cantave had indicated in any way

that they would support isoblonko.

Further investigation by the underground element of the

Nationalist Party of Haiti has revealed Osoblonko was involved

in smuggiing and two murders in Cap Haitien before becoring

Cuban Anbassador:

It was also learned that Osoblonko cid

favors for Batista in Cuba. A former lieutenant of Castro

SUBJECT: Haitian Situation

1963.

Reference is made to my memorandum submitted March 1s MaR

this office and

one a presentate a series E Taylor os Finil

representatives of the Central Intelligence

Agency was held at CIA Headquarters concerning the above

subject.

On May 8,_ 1963, SA Taybr received an urgent telephone

call from Mr. Earl Brennan, legal adviser to the Haitian

National Party and the newly formed National Democratic Union

(UDN). Mr. Brennan advised that he was in receipt of infor-

mation from Roger Rigaud who is presently in the Dominican

Republic, and that this information was vital to the interests

of the United States and the Secret Service.

Mr. Brennan disclosed that since last report to this

Service on March 18, 1963, Osoblonko-(Antonio Rodriguez

Echazabal) had visited the Dominican Republic and then traveled

to New York City for the express purpose of raising money to

finance his efforts to overthrow the present regime in Haiti.

While in New York City, he contacted General Paul Ee Magloire

ex-president of Haiti!

who received $45,000 from Mr. De J.

sanct, a haitian businessman who is a British subject.

Mr. Brennan believes Osoblonko made other contacts in New York

and that at present he has raised in excess of $100,000 for

this venture.

During the interim, the 13-member Alliance for Progress

Mission has returned from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. As reported

previously by Mr. Brennan, at least seven members of this

delegation were reportedly pro-Castro or leaning to the far

left in their political affiliations. Mr. Brennan believes

members of this group,.

including Lillian Jones', Osoblonko's

sister-in-law, worked

the

in a clandestine manner in Haiti to set

stage for the present operation of Osoblonko.

On the return of Osoblonko to the Dominican Republic

approximately one month ago, he purchased a boat and had it

Dre,

equipped with the latest electronic and navigational gear

to be used in connection with his present revolutionary plans.

Roger Rigaud reported to Brennan that approximately two weeks

ago Osoblonko hired an airplane and had leaflets dropped over

Port-au-Prince and other populated areas of Haiti.

leaflets identified Osoblonko's

group as the Unified Revo-

lutionary Forces and contained

an ultimatum that the Haitian

Army unconditionally surrender. Mr. Brennan feels that this

incident was designed to frighten the Haitian people and to

increase the tempo of the current turmoil and difficulties

being encountered by Dr. Duvalier.

Reporting from the Dominican Republic, Roger Rigaud does

not know the actual composition of this group but advises

that it is comprised of some 50 men who are being

trained

by one jacques Cassaganol who had previously received train-

ing in Cuba and had been known to have visited Cuba in 1959.

The

exact location of the training camp site is not known,

but it is believed to be near the Haitian frontier and not

more than 40 miles from Dajaborn in the interior of the

Dominican Republic.

Jacques brother, Raymond Cassaganol, told Rigaud that

he recently returned to the Dominican Republic from New York

where he had been sent by Osoblonko to contact General Paul

Magloire and brief him on the current Haitian situation.

Both of the Cassaganol brothers are violently anti-American.

Mr. Brennan feels that the important role being played by

Jacques in the training of this group shows the deft hand

of the Castro regime in maintaining control of the operation.

It appears to Mr. Brennan that Raymond Cassaganol is

shifting his position and now feels that it would be to the

best interests of the Haitian opposition groups to have a

combined military intervention including the United States,

Venezuelan, and Costa Rican governments.

Mr. Brennan was questioned as

to whether or not he had

any information that Echazabal's son, Antonio Rodriguez Jones,

was involved in any way in the current situation and whether

or not any associates of Jones were involved.

According

to

the information available to Brennan, no active part is

being taken by Jones or his friends

Mr. Brennan advised that Paul Verna is the contact in

Caracas, Venezuela, for the National Democratic Union and

that Verna has allied himself and his group with this cause;

further, that the coordinator for the activities of the

ed himself don

National

Democratic Union in the Caribbean is still Pierre

Rigaud

In conversations Brennan has had with Dr. Roger Rigaud,

it appears that Osoblonko still has a cache of arms in

Martinique that he will use in his revolutionary activity.

Mr. Brennan expects Dr. Rigaud to be in Washington, D.C., on

May 10 and at that time Dr. Rigaud will have further infor

mation on Osoblonko's activities in the Dominican Republic

and on the arms supply in Martinique.

Mr. Brennan is of the opinion that Osoblonko will strike

against the government of Haiti sometime before May 15, 1963,

and from the information brought to his attention it appears

that this operation in Haiti is a stepping stone toward the

bro in a

eventual takeover of the Dominican Republic.

On May 9, 1963, MI. A. P. Flynn of CIA and Special

Agent Joseph Scullay of the FBI were apprised of the infor-

mation set forth above.

On May 23, 1963, Confidential Informant 1-15-9 advised

that Osoblonko

had returned to Washington, D.C., and his pass-

port had been lifted at San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Informant 1-15-9

further advised that Osoblonko had been contacted by Juan Bosch,

President of the Dominican Republic, prior to the raid and

advised that it was necessary that contemplated activity of in-

vading Haiti de stopped.

It is believed that Osoblonko may try

to make contact with members of the Resistance Movement who are

presently located in New Yorks City. One individual mentioned

was Mr. Luc Fouche, former Haitian ambassador to the United

States and Canada, presently living in exile in New York City.

Confidential Informant 1-15-9 advised further that rumors

are rampant concerning tuture activities of Osoblonko and they

range from Osoblonko being an agent of Duvalier to the fact that

he will continue to be engaged in activity to depose Duvalier for

his own personal gain.

Of interest is the incident involving the airplane that was

engaged by Osoblonko on April 20, 1963, to drop leaflets over the

port-au-Prince and other populated areas of Haiti.

• Confidential Informant 1-15-9 has established that the air

plane was obtained from sources in Martinique and also that these

leatlets were prepared in Martinique.

It has not definitely

been established, however, there is still a very strong possi-

bility that Osoblonko may have a cache of arms in Martinique.

exit permit was issued and this was surrendered whenbe arrived

Osoblonko is still classified as a parolee and as such

can be removed from the United States at any time for violation

Of any Immigration and Naturalization laws. Inasmuch as it is a

violation of the Imnigration and Naturalization laws

to actively

participate in the overthrow of a foreign government,

Mr • Dinwiddie expressed an interest in interviewing Osoblonko on

his return to the United States and obtaining a deposition: cover-

ing his recent

Mr. William B. Dinwiddie furnished information that one

Eduardo Palmir, presently employed with the Pan American Newsweek

in New York City, is a valuable contact concerning Cubans in the

United States and in particular has information concerning

Osoblonko.

Palnir was formerly associated with the Intelligence

forces and worked directly under the Castro Regime in Cuba. This

information is being furnished the New York office for a possible

future contact on matters concerning Castro Cubans presently in

the United States. If it becomes necessary to contact Palmir,

it is agreeable with the Immigration and Naturalization Service

that the name Angel Pola be mentioned (Pola was Palmir's super-

visor in intelligence activities in Cuba).

though it as mis addressed and undeliverable.

On November 29, 1962, a second letter, postiarked Havana, Cuba, was

intercepted which gave further support to the alledged plot.

The letter

was addressed to Bernardo Rivero Vorales, and indicated that he contime

his anti-Castro front until the plot developed further. Both letters

He was

a student at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. on 9-24-63.

Investigative Agents concluded that the letters were being deliberately

mis-addressed so as to be undelieverable and therefore stood a chance

of being intercepted. The intent of the writer was not clear but it

was felt that it may have been an attempt to either stir up trouble

Investigation further reveals that the subject has no connection with

any plot to assassinate President Kennedy and that none of the other

subjects did either.

DETAILS

SYNOPSIS

Echazabal left the United

States June 5, 1963,

and his

present whereabouts

is unknown.

INS has issued an emergency

Lookout.

DETAILS OF INVESTIGATION

Reference is made to previous reports

submitted in this

case, with particular reference to report of Special Agent Charles E.

Taylor, Jr., Washington, D. C., dated June 6, 1963.

On June 13, 1963, Mr. William B. Dinwiddie, Investigator,

Immigration and

Naturalization Service, advised

that he had

recently been briefed by 1-15-9 and the following information

developed relating

to Osoblonko. (Antonio Rodriguez Echazabal).

The group formed by Osoblonko, identified as the Unified

Revolutionary Forces, was encamped in Kayuca Dajabon, Dominican

Republic, near the Haitian border. Although Jacques Cassaganol

was then director of training, the leaders of this group were

Osoblonko and Raymond Cassaganol. Osoblonko raised at least

$45,000 in New York City to finance this operation.

It is esti

mated that he has $40,000 that he is using to finance future

activities. Throughout the entire operation in the Dominican

Republic, Osoblonko has demonstrated a capacity to fabricate

stories

for his own gain.

It has been proved on a number of

occasions that he has lied to government officials and has mis-

represented himself as being an agent for the Central Intelligence

Mr. Dinwiddie stated Osoblonko is being sought by the

Immigration and Naturalization Service in connection with their

investigation for possible violation of U.S. Immigration and

Naturalization Service laws.

East Coast of the United States and if Osoblonko re-enters the

United States, he will be either questioned at the port of entry

or paroled to Washington, D. C., for interview.

On June 5, 1963, Osoblonko obtained his Cuban passport from

the Travel Control Section, Immigration and Naturalization Ser-

vice, and at that time he appeared to be in a hurry to leave the

United States. When information was received from 1-15-9 that

Osoblonko was a "security leak", this emergency lookout was

Mr. Dinwiddie plans to question Osoblonko on matters re-

lating to the following:

(1) Why Osoblonko failed to go to Germany when he defected

to the United States. (Information was developed that when

Osoblonko contacted the United States authorities and advised he

was planning to defect, he stated that he would go directly to

Germany; instead he travelled to Paris, France.)

(2) If he travelled from Paris, France, to Martinique and

visa for this purpose.

(The

French authorities are very strict on activities in Martinique

and it appears that Osoblonko bad previously travelled there for

the purpose of making contacts and possibly obtaining a cache of

arms. It is known that Osoblonko obtained a plane and had leai-

lets

prepared by a connercial firm in Martinique.)

(3) The scope of Osoblonko's activities in the Dominican

Republic and whether he was working on behalf of Duvalier or

working against Duvalier.

(Rumors are rampant concerning

Osoblonko's activities in the Dominican Republic and 1-15-9 does

not know whether or not be was aligned with a communist sponsored

group or whether his activities vere directed for bis own personal

gain.
