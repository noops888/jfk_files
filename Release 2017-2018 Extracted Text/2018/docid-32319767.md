SHIRLEY FABRY (protect identity throughout this
document), 154 1/2 Maple Avenue, Smithfield, Ohio, was
interviewed and furnished the following information:

She served as a confidential informant for the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for many years. As a condition
precedent to her association with the FBI, and without which she
would not have agreed to serve as an informant, she recalls that
she signed a document in which the FBI promised and assured her
that her identity as an informant would never be divulged, that
there were no exceptions to this guarantee, and that the promise
would extend beyond her death and would last for all time. This
promise was express and explicit and was not subject to
interpretation. Throughout her tenure as an FBI informant, she
disoussed the confidential status of her relationship with the
FBI with each of the FBI Agents who were assigned as her contact
Agent. Hach of these Agents affirmed the confidential nature of
her relationship with the FBI.

She has never told her children or closest friends of

her relationship with the FBT, would be personally devastated
should they ever learn of it, and believes that her family could
be put in grave physical danger in the event it were made public
that she was an FBI informant. She ensured that all contacts she
had with the FBI were conducted in such a manner that they would
be secret. She has never been identified as an informant, and
believes she“has never even been suspected of being an FBI
informant.

She expressly requested that her identity continue ‘to

.be protected at all times, and that any documents that would

DORIS PALMER, 300 Packer Street, Uhrichville, Ohio, was
interviewed and furnished the following information:

She is the widow of CHARLES W. PALMER (protect identity
throughout this document), who died in 1992, having been married
to him for more than 50 years. In response to a question
foncerning her knowledge of any relationship her husband may have
had with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), she knew
there was some kind of relationship, but indicated that Mr,
PALMER had never confided to her the egecitics Of exactly what it
Was and what it entailed. she described her husband ag being a
very quiet individual and one who valued his privacy above all :
else, Because she was unaware of the scope and full nature of the
relationship that Mr, PALMER had had with the FEI, she very
firmly believes that he would not have told his children or
friends of such a relationship, and believes that since he never
told anyone of it, he would want such a relationship to remain a
Secret. She has always been somewhat afraid that mr. PALMER's.
relationship with the FBI would be made blic, and fearg that :
there could be some kind of retaliation taken againgt her, her ve
children, or grandchildren, if it were. ‘S

While she was somewhat aware of her husband's
relationship with the PBI, she would not want 4£ to be made known
now, as it could cause embarrassment, criticism oY contempt for
herself, her children, or grandchildren, or it could put them in
danger, and would request that the relationship never be made
public. E

DORRAINE MILBURN, 330 Claymont, Uhrichville, Ohio,
telephone number (614) 922-3521, was interviewed and furnished
the following information:

She is the daughter of CHARLES W. PALMER (protect
identity throughout this document) and DORIS PALMER. Her father
died in 1992, and her mother, while in ill health, continues to
reside in Uhrichville, Ohio:

Her mother contacted her on Tuesday, September 12,

‘ 1995, and told her that an Agent of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) had telephonically contacted her that evening
and questionned her as to her late husband's relationship with
the FBI many years earlier, and that it had greatly worried her
mother. Her mother told her that she had lived in fear for many
years that CHARLES PALMER's relationship with the FBI would be
made public, and her mother had been looking over her shoulder
for years in the fear that she, her children, or grandchildren
would be physically harmed in retaliation for the work that
CHARLES PALMER had done for the FBI. Her mother told her that
because of this fear, she hoped with ali her heart that CHARLES
PALMER would never be identified as an FBI informant.

. While she was gewong up in the 1940's, -50's and-60's,
she had a non-specific knowledge that her father had some kind of
relationship with the FBI, but it was one he never talked about,
and never discussed with her or her brother or sister. She
believes this is true because he wanted to protect her from
knowledge that could have somehow caused her harm or put her in
danger. She too, along with her mother, has had a long-time fear
that her father's informant status with the FBI would somehow be
made public, and that she or other members of her family would be

in very real physical danger from unknown persons who would want

to retaliate against her father for his FBI involvement. Since

the FBI contact with her mother on September 12, 1995, she has

discussed this issue with her brother, MICHAEL PALMER, and he has ac
told her that he feels the same way, and that he believes the

threat of physical harm is a very real one if their father's FBI
informant status were ever to be made public in any way.

B, GENE WYATT, 289 Westview Drive, Winchester,
Virginia, telephone number (540) 667-4725, was interviewed and
furnished the following information:

Ee is a retired Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). As part of his responsibilities as an FBI
Agent, while assigned to the Cincinnati Division of the FBI, he
met with various individuals who provided information to the FBI
on a regular or intermittent basis, and who were designated as
confidential informants of. the FBI.

From the late 1960's, until approximately 1972, he was
assigned as the contact Agent for JOHN FABRY, JR. (protect : :
identity throughout this document) and SHIRLEY FABRY (protect ao
identity throughout this document), husband and wife, who were :
each formal confidential informants of the Cincinnati Division of
the FBI. Hach had been informants of the FBI before he became
his/her contact Agent, but he was the assigned contact Agent when
they each were closed as informants. While each of the FABRYs 3
knew the other was an FBI informant, they were each very much
concerned that the confidential nature of their relationship with
the FBI, and their identities as FBI informants, be maintained in
: the strictest confidence by the FBI, and noted this desire with
him on several occasions. To the best of his knowledge, neither
of the FABRYs was ever suspected of being an FBI informant, and
neither was ever publicly surfaced or identified as an FBI
informant. bees ~

All meetings that he held with the FABRYs were :
conducted in private places sc that that relationship would
remain confidential. To the best of his knowledge, neither of the
FABRYs even told their children of their informant status with
the FBI. While he can no longer remember specifics, but because
he made it a practice with ait informants he contacted, he -
believes he specifically and expressly promised that the x
relationship of the FABRYs with the FBI would forever be kept
secret, and he believes the FABRYs relied on these assurances to
maintain their informant status.

He believes that Mrs. FABRY terminated her relattonship
with the FBI some time before Mr. FABRY did, and he does not
specifically recall what she may have said at that time, but does
recall Mr. FABRY's statements and wishes at the time Mr. FABRY's
relationship with the FBI was terminated, and is confident that
Mrs. FABRY's wishes mirrored those of her husband's. He recalled
that one of the reasons that. Mr. FABRY wished to end his
informant status with the FBI was because of his desire to become
involved in local politics, and he was quite emphatic that it was
his express desire that his informant status, and that of his
wife, be kept confidential, as it was his belief that disclosure
would effectively ruin his chances for a political career. In
fact, Mr. FABRY was elected mayor of Smithfield, Ohio after his
relationship with the FBI was terminated. He also recalls that
Mr. FABRY had indicated that he would not testify in open court, ©
as to do so would identify him as an informant.

He recalls that also during his tenure as an FBI Agent
assigned to the Cincinnati FBI Division, from approximately 1969
until he was transferred out of the Cincinnati Division in 1975,
he was the contact Agent for another. Cincinnati Division
informant named CHARLES W, PALMER (protect identity throughout
this document). He characterized PALMER as a very private, close-
mouthed and secretive individual who repeatedly stressed the
importance of maintaining the confidential nature of his
relationship with the FBI. He does not know if. PALMER ever
confided in his wife as to his FBI informant status. All meetings
and contacts he had with PALMER were held in private places, for
the express reason to maintain the confidential nature of the ia
relationship. While he is unable to recall specifically, he
believes that he would have expressly and specifically promised
to PALMER that the FBI informant status of PALMER would be
protected for all time by the FBI. During the time he was
assigned as PALMER's contact Agent, he is sure that PALMER was
never suspected of being an FBI informant, nor was he ever
identified as such by the FBI, himself or others.

DONALD R. REESE, 159 Keethler Drive South, Westerville,
Ohio, telephone number (614) 882-3131, was interviewed and
furnished the following information:

He is a retired aaa Agent of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). As part of his responsibilities as an FBI:
Agent, while assigned to the Cincinnati Division of the FBI, he
met with, various individuals who provided information te the FBI
on_a regular or intermittent basis, and who were designated as
informants of the FBI.

cence Among those people he was assigned to contact on a
. regular basis was CHARLES W. PALMER (protect identity throughout.
this document), who had had a formal informant status with the
FBI for many years prior to his assignment to PALMER. From
approximately 1975 until approximately 1977, when PALMER was
discontinued as an FBI informant, he met with PALMER on a regular
basis, during which meetings he would debrief PALMER as to the
information provided to the FBI. These meetings were always held
clandestinely, in places selected for their private nature,
because PALMER did not want his relationship with the FBI made a
matter of public record, a desire that PALMER explicitly and
specifically related to him on several occasions. To the best of
his knowledge and rememberance, PALMER was never surfaced or even
) suspected of being an FBI informant during the more than 30 years
of his association with the FBI. He characterized PALMER as a
very close-mouthed and private individual. :
As an example of how seriously PALMER viewed the secret
and confidential nature of his relationship with the FBI, he
recalled that when PALMER was closed as an FBI informant, PALMER
indicated that he would never testify in open court or before
administrative hearing boards where he would be identified, or
potentially identified, as an FBI informant.
