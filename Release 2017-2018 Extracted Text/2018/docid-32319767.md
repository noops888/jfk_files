DORIS PALMER, 300 Packer Street, Uhrichville, Ohio, was

Interviewed and furnished the following information:

She is the widow of CHARLES W. PALMER (protect identity

chroughout this document), who died in 1992, having been married

to him for more than 50 years. In response to a question

concerning her knowledge of any relationship her husband may have

had with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), she knew

there was some kind of relationship, but indicated

PALMER had never confided to her the specifies of exactly what it

was and what it entailed. She described her husband as being a

very quiet individual and one who valued his privacy above all

else. Because she was unaware of the scope and full nature.of the

relationship that MI. PALMER had had with the FBI,

firmly believes that he would not have told his children or

friends of such a relationship,

told anyone of it, he would want such a relationship to remain a

secret. She has always been somewhat afraid that Mr. PALMER'S

relationship with the fBI would be made public, and fears that

there could be some kind of retaliation taken against her, her

chilaren, or grandchildren, if 1t were.

While she was somewhat aware of her husband's

relationship with the FBI, she would not want it to be made known

now,

as it could cause embarrassment, criticism or contempt for

herself, her children, or grandchildren, or it could put them in

rubes, and would request that the relationship never ba meas

DORRAINE MILBURN, 330 Claymont, Uhrichville, Onio,

telephone number (614) 922-3521, was interviewed and furnished

the following information:

She is the daughter of CHARLES W. PALMER (Protect

identity throughout this document) and DORIS PALMER. Her father

died in 1992, and her mother, while in 111 health, continues to

reside in Uhrichville, Ohio.

Her mother

contacted her on Tuesday,

September 12,

1995, and told her that an Agent of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) had telephonically, contacted her that evening

and questionned her as to her late husband's relationship with

the FBI many years earlier,

and that it had greatly worried her

mother. Her mother told her that she had lived in fear for many

years that CHARLES PALMER's relationship with the FBI would be

made public, and her mother had been looking over her shoulder

for years in the fear that she, her children, or grandchildren

would be physically harmed in retaliation for the work that

CHARLES PALMER had done for the FBI. Her mother told her that

because of this fear, she hoped with all her heart that CHARLES

PALMER would never be identified as an FBI informant.

While she was grwong up in the 1940's, -50's and-60's,

she had a non-specific knowledge that her father had some kind of

relationship with the FBI, but it was one he never talked about,

and never discussed with her or her brother or sister. She

belleves this is true because he wanted to protect her from

knowledge that could have somehow caused her harm or put her in

danger. she too, along with her mother, has had a long-time lear

that her father's informant status with the FBI would somehow be

made public, and that she or other members of her family would be

in very real physical danger from unknown persons who would want

to retaliate against her father for his FBI involvement, Since

the fBI contact with her mother on September 12, 1995, she has

discussed this issue with her brother, MICHAEL PALMER, and he has

told her that he feels the same way, and that he believes the

threat of physical harm is a very real one if their father's FBI

informant status were ever to be made public in any way.

Her mother is due to enter the hospital during the week

of September 18, 1995 for heart surgery, and believes that the

added pressure of the possibility that CHARLES PALMER's identity

as an FBI informant might be made known can have only a most

negative impact on her prognosis for recovery. She requested that

if the FBI needs to recontact her mother, that the contact be

made through her, to lessen the anxiety such a contact would

'occasion.

While her father was

alive, and since his death, he has

as an FBI informant, and has never been

herselt, she expressed

the strongest wish that her father would

B, GENE WYATT, 289 Westview Drive, Winchester,

furnished

telephone number (540) 667-4725, was interviewed and

the following information:

He is a retired Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI). As part of his responsibilities as an FBI

Agent, while assigned to the Cincinnati Division of the FBI, he

met with various individuals who provided information to the FBI

on a regular or intermittent basis, and who were designated as

confidential informants of the FBI.

From the late 1960's, until approximately 1972, he was

assigned as the contact Agent for JOHN FABRy, JR. (protect

identity throughout this document) and SHIRLEY FABRY (protect

identity throughout this document), husband and wife, who were

each formal confidential informants of the Cincinnati Division of

the FBI. Each had been informants of the FBI before he became

his/her contact Agent, but he was the assigned contact Agent when

they each were closed as informants. While each of the FABRYs

knew the other was an FBI informant, they were each very much

concerned that the confidential nature of their relationship with

the FBI, and their identities as FBI informants, be maintained in

the strictest confidence by the FBI, and noted this desire with

him on, several occasions. To the best of his knowledge, neither

of the

FABRYS was ever suspected of being an FBI informant, and

neither was ever publicly surfaced or identified as an FBI

Informant,

All meetings that he held with the FABRYs were

conducted in private places so that that relationship would

remain confidential. To the best of his knowledge, neither of the

told their children of their informant status with

the FBI. While he can no longer remember specifics, but because

he made it a practice with all informants he contacted, he

believes he specifically and expressly promised that the

relationship of the FABRYs with the FBI would forever be kept

secret, and he believes the FABRYs relied on these assurances to

maintain their informant status.

He believes that Mrs. FABRY terminated her relationship

with the FBI some time before Mr. FABRY did, and he does not

specifically recall what she may have said at that time, but does

recall Mr. FABRY's statements and wishes at the time Mr. FABRY's

terminated, and is confident that

Mrs. FABRY's wishes mirrored those of her husband's.

He recalled

that one of the reasons that Mr. FABRY wished to end his

informant status with the FBI was because of his desire to become

Involved in local politics, and he was quite emphatic that it was

his express desire that his informant status, and that of his

wife, be kept confidential, as it was his bellef that disclosure

Chances for a political career. In

fact, MI. FABRY was elected mayor of Smithfield, Ohio after his

relationship with the FBI was terminated. He also recalls that

Mr. FABRY had indicated that he would not testify in open court,

as to do so would identify him as an informant.

He recails that also during his tenure as an FBI Agent

assigned to the Cincinnati FBI Division, from approximately 1969

until he was transferred out of the Cincinnati Division in 1975,

he was the contact Agent for another Cincinnati Division

informant named CHARLES W. PAIMER (protect identity throughout

this document). He characterized PALMER as a very private, close-

mouthed and secretive individual who repeatedly stressed the

importance of maintaining the confidential nature of his

relationship with the FBI. He does not know 1f. PALMER ever

confided in his wife as to his FBI informant status. All meetings

and contacts he had with PALMER were held in private places, for

the express reason to maintain the confidential nature of the

relationship. While he is unable to recall specifically, he

believes that he would have expressly and specifically promised

to PALMER that the ab1 intormant status of PALMaR would be

protected for all time by the FBI. During the time he was

assigned as PALMER's contact Agent, he is sure that PALMER was

suspected of being an FBI informant, nor was he ever

identified as such by the FBI, himself or others.

approximate.y 1975 until approximately 1977, when PALMER was

discontinued as an FBI informant, he met with PALMER on a regular

basis, during which meetings he would debrief PALMER as to the

information provided to the FBI. These meetings were always held

clandestinely, in places selected for their private nature,

his knowledge and rememberance, PALMER was never surfaced or even

suspected of being an FBI informant during the more than 30 years

very close-mouthed and private individual.

As an example of how seriously PALMER viewed the secret

recalled that when PALMER was closed as an FBI informant, PALMER

indicated that he would never testify in open court or before
