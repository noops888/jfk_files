MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director for Operations

THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Amondnent and Termination of Project
KDFACTOR

1. Project KDFACTOR supported a visual and photo-
graphic surveillance operation in Mexico City targetted
against the Soviet Mabassy. Assets included five agents
and two baschouse surveillance sites. Termination of
this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of
a security review which revealed that the VWBLANKET
principal knew the basic details of the KDFACTOR opera-

tions,

- 2. Agent termination was accomplished without any
immédiate difficulties; however, continued security will
. depend on the terminated agents' silence. In the event
there is a compromise, the risk of damage to the Sta-
tion's relations with the Mexican Government should be
minimized because of the compatible nature of KDFACTOR's

operations.

3. ‘The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj-
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc~
curred as the result of miscalculation of termination
costs. This project action requests this additional
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses.

4, The FI Staff recommends approval of this amend-

ment/termination request. ‘

\ For Operations

‘ SUBJECT : Project KDFACTOR - Amendment
i and Termination Request, ~

‘ 1, The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 paceipced
4 as the LIEMFTY Project) was initially approved in
. 1958 to provide financial and material support for
visual and photographic surveillance operations
i targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites,

2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
AbpC in the amount of $19,090 for FY - 72 and
$20,000 for FY - 73, Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated
30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment N. 1
to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
for FY + 72 to provide for costs of agent

terminations,

3. The decision to terminate all agents and
facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
on a security review of the project activities
which indicated that the VWBLANKET principal knew
the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance
sites, and probably the true names and former
cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project. a

4, The cost of terminating the agents under the
KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
closing down, the two basehouses under the project
was $1,412, The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR
Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating the agents and
facilities associated with the KDFACTOR Project.
Although Amendment No. 1 to the project was
approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the
cost of terminating the agents in the

ie

SECRET


foe

SECRET

Froject, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the ‘terms of cach Memorandum -of Oral
Commitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican

law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Amendment
was requested, Termination payments made to each
agent aré as follows:

KDFACTOR-2 (Recruited 1956) $8,160
KDFACTOR-S (Recruited 1956) 2,366
KDFACTOR-6 (Recruited 1956) 2,830
KDFACTOR-8 (Recruited 1965) 649
KDFACTOR-9 (Recruited 1966) 1,568

The long tenure of three of the terminated
agents, the relatively high monthly salary of
KDFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the
termination payments in accordance with Mexican
isw and custom were the primary reasons that the
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

S. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
may at some future date decide to divulge to an
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project
operations, KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-S, and KDFACTOR-6
have worked in photo surveillance operations for
the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
safesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station, However, since the KDFACTOR Project was
not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project
be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY -
72 to cover the costs of terminating five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites under this

project.

: MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: MPS/BG
_ SUBJECT: Renewal of Project KDFACTOR
i . in 1972 for $19,000

in 1973 for $20,000

1. This project covers photo and visual surveillance
of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. One observation
post covers the front gate of the building,and another
covers the rear gate and walled compound. Five salaried
agents man the sites. four in front and one in back, An
official cover case officer collects the take (rolls of
film and logs of visitors) once a week by car meetings
with the OP keepers, The films are developed and printed
inside the Station,

2. The production from this operation has consis~
tently been rated high by the Bureau (which is the prin-
cipal customer in the field), by other Government agencies
and by SB Division. Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy
might not be a high priority target in some countries.
But the fact that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico is a large
and active one and the fact that its primary target is
operations against the United States make our effort
important and valuable. This is the operation that pro- this ew,
duced the photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald visiting the ervor 5
Soviet Embassy in 1962. y
3, This seemingly straightforward operation has not D/EG,
always been so uncomplicated. Both sites have been in 19 Apsl7)
operation and served by the same OP keepers for more than
a dozen years, At one of the sites the OP keeper's wife
and children take turns manning the equipment. A now~
: terminated principal ageut was divorced several years
: “ago from-a wife who knew a lot about the operation. Some
desk officers believe that the medical doctor who for
years was supposed to be developing the films was simply
too busy to do so and that the work was probably done by
his uncleared secretary. Family relationships keep
cropping up among supposedly compartmented agents. All
of this is in the files but not in any one place. We



, believe it is time for the Station to make an updated

| security review of the operation with particular attention
to the knowledgeability of terminated agents and their
families. We also believe that the Station should now
address itself to the contingency that the present sites
or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative
means of continuing their valuable coverage.

4. The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970
with the condition that termination payments to the
principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a
monthly basis. This condition has been met.

5. The budgets requested for the next two years are
simple and straightforward. Salaries and the traditional
bonuses for the five paid agents come to about $13,000.
Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to
$5,600. The small balance is for operational expenses,
This project.action also requests amendment of the FY
1971 budget by $4,260 to cover that part of the cost of
termination bonuses ‘to the principal agent and his di-
vorced wife which could not be absorbed by the project.
The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.

6. This is a valuable and productive project which
helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement. The

FI Staff recommends approval.

Changes:

1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. -KDFACTOR-7 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

2. Howard T. BACGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce H, FERNALD, When
ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent

meetings.

Accomplishments:

1, This project has provided continuous daily photo-
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S, citizens,
visitors, and TDY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.

These photographs. and reports have contributed operational
support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not
attainable elsewhere, For example, whenever the Soviets
change all their license numbers the Station is able to
compile a new, complete roster within a matter of weeks.

Costs: ‘ :

1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and

Projoct LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic

Surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Nexico City. The

aim is to identify and cover the movezents of porsons
entering and leaving the Embassy, including Soviets and
visitors. Tho intelligenco collected through such activity
contributes tothe Station's overall Soviet operations
program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to sore
extent, Priority A-4, of the Operating Directive for Mexico,

Description:

1, The Project operates through two fixed basehouse
surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a

prinéipal-agent, and six sub-agents.

A team of four sub-

agents, operating from a basehouse, maintains yisual and
photographic ‘surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front

“entrance. OQnoSub-agent, operating from a second base-

house, covers an. area in back of the Bnbassy, where Soviet

“officials meet, play and work. These units photograph all

persons moving in or out of the specific target areas. They
also. maintain logs and provide written reports on observed
activity. All of this material is passed to the principal
agent, Who passes the film to another sub-agent for process-
ing at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the
film is processed and pyinted, the principal agent passes
the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the

Station case officer.

A brief description of each unit,

each agent and his role in the operation follows,

of the Soviet Embassy. This house has been in
gince October 1966. It is.rented through

LILYRIC baschowse team. He maintains contact with the
“principal agent and does some photographic work. ‘Howover,:
because LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside as an industrial
; enginéor, “hé.is unable to spend. much time operating the
+. LILYRIC photographic”equipmont, and most of this work is
a done by ‘his wife, LIEMPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26
“and LIEMPTY-27 (soe paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 bolow),

‘and -LIEMPTY-14, has. been a prep school student. Ho assists
in operating thé LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran-
, scribes notes into a finished typewritten log of ovents.

7. LICALLA. (MEXI-03)-is a basehouse located behind
the Soviet Embassy, It has been in-operation since 1957.
The ‘building, a four-unit affair, collectively known as
LIMUST, i6 Agency owned. It was purchased through ‘
LIMOUSINE in September 1957, and the property is in his
name. ..The .LICALLA site is occupied by LIEMPTY-9 (see
Paragraph 8. below) and he runs the suxveillance operation

from it.



8. LIEMPTY=9,, (2612136454) is the only agent operating
from. the -LICALLA ‘site, He does all the photograpay, main~
tains -logs'and prepares. observation reports, He also main=
tains ‘contact with the principal agent. . LIENPTY-9 is a,
part-time insurance salesman and is self-employed in. the
accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.

9, "Raymond. H, GERENDE (201-119523) has been the
priticipal agent for this project. He. 1s a Mexican national

‘contract agent who is sclf-employed as ‘an English teacher
““andalso works as.a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer.

GERENDE has beon mainly responsible for maintaining contact
with’ the LIEMPTY agents, passing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. He has“also paid them and handicd all other
administrative matters, He is being terminated by the end

ot FY ti for security reasons (sce Probloms, paragraph 1),

10. “Bruce H, FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced

- GERENDE (sce paragraph 9 above) as the project's principal

agent in early December 1969, FERNALD, a U.S. citizen born
in’ June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
immigrant, He is responsible for maintaining contact with
the LIEMPTY agents. and collecting the product for passing
to. the Static ease officer. He also handles administrative
matters, including agent Salary payments. | FERNALD is

financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY,

11. The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (NEXI-137) is
locited in a room ‘at GERENDE's residence. It is equipped
to process the photographs taken by the LIEMPTY surveillance
units. ‘The work is done by LIEMPTY-4, (Sec paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE Will be terminated by the end: of.

FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish-a new
LIBNPTY’ photographic laboratory at a new safesite.

12. LIEMPTY-4 (261-117967) processes 11 the photo-
graphic film taken by’ the LIEMPTY photographers and makes
the number of prints required, He does this work at/ night

‘: 130). The LLENTE AP mobile unft, consisting of LIEMPTY-10
and LIEMPTY-11, is being removed from Project ‘LIEMPTY and
placed.under Project: LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team,. The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
~i growing. demand. for operational surveillance support from
the various Station operating sections. The transfer will
- become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both
FY 1971. project budgets ~have been adjusted to cover financial
“aspects. of the change,

2. Raymond H. GERENDE was removed as the LIEMPTY
principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
problem (sec Problems, paragraph 1). He was replaced on
9.December 1965 by Bruce .H. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating. under cover as a retired immigrant. Thé chang? has
caused some delay in the. receipt of photographs because
FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not
significantly reduced by this delay, The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved

¢onsiderably.

Accomplishments:
1. Project. LIEMPTY haa provided continuous daily
photographic--and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the tront entrance and rear areas of the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City, All Soviet personnel and their visitors

entering or leaving the Embassy have. been-photographed. In
addition, visual surveiilance reports were prepared when
appropriate, These photographs and reports have contributed
essential operational support .to the Station's Soviet oper~

ations program,

2. Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned tothe FBI, AF/OSI and the 902nd
Military Intelligence Group for uperational use in debriefing
their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
‘operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
902nd ‘controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at



seenel ;

the Soviet Embassy in-Mexico City, Similafty, an AP/OSI
controlled agont scheduled to moct a Soviet contact was
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed
another person who appeared at the mocting site and this
person is beliéVed'to..be the agent's Soviet case officer.
Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and
the FBI in running their controlled double agent itera

against the Soviets in Moxico.

3. within ono weok after a biannual change of license
Plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a ~
complete list of the new tag numbers, along with a complete
- identification of the vehicles, Among other things, this

enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a kaown KGB officer, during his
last few days in Moxico,

. 4, LIEMPTY has also dotormined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequéntly gravitate to groupings with their
RIS colleagues in the "safot of the Embassy backyard,
This fact enabled the Station.to mako certain tentative
KGB and GRU identifications, In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited,

5. In the field of Sovict patterns of activity and
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate
changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
“that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
activity pattern following the defection of Raisa
Yerofeyevna KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Mission in Mexico, The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,

a Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officer.
LIKMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, a known GRU
officer, Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
suspect KGB Officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a
“restricted area" at the Soviet Embassy and also established
who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg
Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Mexico City
from Caracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was able to observe
IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav
Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press ‘Attache and First Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy, IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Embassy

SECRET


several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had ‘contact with other known. Soviet intelligence officers
while visiting. This kind of information is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible
recruitment or defection,

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIEMPTY ‘photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Enbassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases. ‘The LIEMPTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have
been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations.

Problems:

1. A security problem has developed involving
Raymond H. GERENDE, According to GERENDE, his wife wants
a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatability of
personalities. The problem basically is that both want
custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute
that ‘has become more bitter and violent daily. In addition,
the monetary settlement is in dispute. The problem is
compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in.some
considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behaif of
the Agency, Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and
‘possible compromise of’ LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP.

Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
expose him as an Agency employee. Since late 1969, Mexico
City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his
wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
the Station to-have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the
project. After weighing all factors, it has been decided
that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him
by the end of FY 1979, GERENDE will be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve



“project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her

. from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The FY 1970 budget is' being amended to cover this amount.

2. her aspects of security continue relatively
unchanged,”. All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from
the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the target aréa, Occasionally emergency meetings are
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
also meets LIENPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4
directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been
given a special extension in the Station through which he
may call as "Dr. Carios" to leave a message for "Victor"
(FERNALD), The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-

ation and collect the product,

Coordination:

Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY, ~

Future Plans:

1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to

~ produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
officials, Operational procedures and the project mecha-
nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H, FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).

2, The Project does not include an w»dated plan for
emergency contact during violent action or government over-
throw. The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters

-in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.



Costs:

.-1, General! $23,635 is requested for FY 1971. It
is requested that the project be amended for FY 1970 in the
amount of $10,498 (from $38,970-to $49,468) in order to
cover termination payments to Raymond H. GERENDE and his
wife, LIEMPTY-19.

2. Source of Funds: Project LIEMPTY is included in
the Western Hemisphere Division's FY 1971 Operating Program
in the amount of $40,000. Funds for the FY 1970 amendment
will be absorbed in the current WH Division's finance
allocation. |

Purpose: |
H Project LIimirTY supports = viagual and photographic
i surveillance of the Soviot Embussy in Moxico City. The i
1 aim is to identify and cover the noverenta of pyrsong t
entering and leaving the Kmbassy, including Soviets and :
visitors. The intelligence collected through auch activity H
contributes to the Station's overall Soviet operations i
program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to some i
extent, Priority A-4, of tho Operating Directive for Moxico. j

: Description:
1. The Project operates through two fixed basehouse

surveillance posts, a emall photographic laboratory, &
i principal agent, aod six sub-agents. A team of four sub-
agents, Operating from a basehouse, maintains visual and |
photographic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front :
i entrance. One sub-agént, operating from a second page-
! house, covers’ an area in back of the Embasay, where Soviet
i officials meet, play and vork. These units photegraph all ‘
persons moving in or out of the specific target areas, They
i also maintain logs and provide written reports on observed

| activity. All of thia material is passed to the principal *
i agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process- :
ing at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the i
‘film is processed and printed, the principul agent passes i
| the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the
1 Station case officer. A brief description of each unit,
| each agent and his rolo in the operation follows.



"2, LILYRIC (MAXI-132) is a basohouse located near
, the front of the Soviet Exbassy. This house has been in
operation since October 1966. It is rented through
LIMOUSINE (201-5762), © cleared Aporican businessman. He
is the ostensible owner of record and, as the landlord,
-eollects rent frof. the tenants and then passes it to the
Station case officer. LIEHPTY-13 and hia family (see
paragraph 3 below) live in the LILYRIC house and conduct
their surveillance operation from it during daylight hours

(0800-1800).

3. LIBMPYY-13 (201--119961) is tho key member of the
LILYRIC basehouse toan.. He maintains contact with the
principal agent end does sone photographic work. However,
becauge LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside ‘a8 an induntrial
engineer, he is unable to spend much time operating the
LILYRIC photographic cquipaent, and most of this work ia
done by his wife, LIXHPTY-14, and their sons, LIEMPTY-26
and LIEMPTY-27 (soe paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 bolow).

4. ULIEMPTY-14 (201-167567) is the main photographer
and observer at the LILYRIC basehouse. She works closely
with her husband, LIS{PTY-13, in runping. the operation,
including the preparation of observation roports and logs,
Bhe also does the LILYRIC housekeeping, ae any housewife
would do. : :

3. LYEMPTY-26 (201-762111), the son of LIEMPTY-13 and
LIEMPTY-14, has been a atudent at the wexican Tochnoloyical
Institute. In his spare time he operatesthe LILYRIC photo-
graphic equipment, ond helps LISMPYY-14 in maintaining the
arrival and departure logs of target personalities.

ae 6. LIRUPTY-27 (201-762112), another gon of LIEHITY-13
and LIEMPTY-14, has beon a prep school student. He assists
in operating the LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran-
scribes notes into a finished typewritten log of events.

7. LICALLA GIEXI-03) is s baschouse located behind
the Soviet Eubassy., It has been in operation since 1957.
The building, a four-uoit affair, collectively known as
LIMUST, is Agency owned. It was purchased through
LIMOUSINE in Soptember 1957, and the property ie in his
pare. Tho LICALLA site is occupied by LIEMPTY-9 (see
paragraph 8 below) and he runs the surveillance operation

from it.



&, LIEMPTY-9 (201-136454) is the only ayent operating
from the LICALLA site. He does a11 the photography, main-
tains logs and prepares observation reports. He also asin-
tains contact with the principal agent. LIEMPTY-9 is a
part-time insurance salesman and is 1f-employed in the
accounting business, which he conducts at the LICALLA site.

9. Raysiond H., GERENDE (201-119523) has been the
princtpal agent for this project. Ue ig a Mexican national

+ contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher

and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer.
GERENDE ‘has been mainly responsible for muintaining contact
with the LIEMPTY agents, paesing inatructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. He has also paid them and handled all other
administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end
of FY 1970 for security reasons (sce Problems, paragraph 1).

10. Bruce H, FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced
GERENDE (see parograph 9 above) as the project's principal
agent in early December 1969, FERHALD, a U.S. Citizen born
in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
immigrant. He is responsible for naintaining contact with
the LIEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing
to the Station case officer. lic algo handles administrative
matters, including agent salary ‘payuents. FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.

11, The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (MEXI-137) is
located in a room at GERENDE'’s residence. It ig equipped
te process the photographs taken by the LIEMPTY surveillance
unita. The work is done by LIEHPTY-4. (See paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of
FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LISMPTY photographic laboratory at a new safesite.

12, LIEMPTY-4 (201-117967) processes all the photo-
graphic film taken by the LIEMPTY photographers and makes
the number of prints required. He does this work at night
in the LIEMPTY photographic laboratory. He is self-employed
ag a medical doctor, and he is a brotaer-in-law of GERENDE,
in whose home the laboratory is located.

Changes: \
1, The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIKMPTY-10 ©
and LIEMPYY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team. The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
® growing demand for operational surveillance support from
the various Station operating sections. The transfer will
become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both |
FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial

aspects of the change.

2, Raymond H, GERENDE was removed ag the LIEMPTY
principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
problem (see Problema, paragraph 1). He was replaced on
9 December 1969 by Bruce H. FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating ‘under cover as a retired immigrant. The change has
caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
FERNALD is unnble to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not
Significantly reduced by this delay, The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved

considerably,

Accomplishments:

1. Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the front entrance and rear aress of the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. All Soviet personnel and their visitors
entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed. , In
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
appropriate. These photographs and reports have contributed
essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper-

ations program.

3, Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 903nd
Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing

- their agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
Graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at

the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations
against the Soviets in Mexico. r ieenaniensinail

3. Within one week after a biannusl change of license

complete lint of the now tag numbers, alony with a complete
identification of the vehicles, Among other things, this
enabled tho Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich RIKITIN, a known KGS officer, during hie

last few days im Moxico.

4, LIEMPTY has also deternined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequently gravitate to groupings with their :
RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the Kubassy backyard. |
This fact enablod the Station to make certain tentative
MGB and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited. |

5. In the field of Soviet patterns of activity and i
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurato i
changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed |
that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his |
activity pattern following the defection of Raisa i
Yerofeyevnn KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial |
Nission in Mexico. The sume applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO, - ee
a Second Secrotary at the Rebasyy and a known KGB officor. H
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and i
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAXOV, a known KGB Hl
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, « known GRU :
officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a Ce
suspect KGB officer, showed that he cid, in fact, work in a :

“restricted areca” at the Sovict Embassy end also established
who gone of his ussociates were. In thé case of Oleg
Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Hexico City '
from Caracas, Venezuela, LIKHPTY was ablo to observe
IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyostoslav H
Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of H
the Soviet Esbassy. IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Fmbassy A

SECRET


several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known Sovict inteiligence officers
while visiting. This kind of iaforsation is a basic
contribution.to the Station's cortinuing cfforts to
identify and asses@ certain Soviets fur possible
recruitment or defection.

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet BSloc Division uses
LIBMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officinls, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases, The LISUPTY material aleo
keeps the Station's Soviet section wo-to-date on which
Soviet officera have been in the Shbassy, wiici ones Save
been away; who has used shich car; vho has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations.

Probless: H

1, A security probles has dcreloped involving i
Raymond H. GBRENDE. According to GERENDE, his wife vants {
a divorce, apparently based sainly os incompatability of H
personalities. The problem basically is that both vant
custody of the children and this mts sparked a dispute
that has becone nore bitter and violent daily. In addition,
the monetary settlerent is in dispute. The problea is
compounded by the fact that GEREXDS's wife knows io sone 1
considerable detail of GEREXDE's activities on behalf of
the Agency. Thus, if the case coeg go to court, it could i
lead to the surfacing of GEREXDS's Agency employment and H
possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP, i
Even if the case does not go to court, GBRENDE's wife could :
expose hin as an Agency employee. Since late 1965, Mexico f j
City Station has been in touch with both GERENDS and his
wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
the Station to have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GEREXDE's cover and taat of the
project. After weighing all factors, it has heen decided
that continued employment of GSALYVE ts not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate bin ‘
by the end of FY 1970. GERENDE vill be paid o termination i
bonus of $10,000 for 15 sears service, about $1,250 sore
than the 38,750 hig contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination. is anicable end thereby preserve

In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as s security measure designed to keep her
from revealing what she knows about project operations.
The F¥ 1970 hudget is being amended to cover this amount.

her aspects of security continue relatively
All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wages. The Station is compartnented from
the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retired immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969. Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the target aren. Occasionally emergency meetings are
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired, FERNALD
also meets LIKMPTY-4 to exchange films and prin These
meetings are heid weekly at pre-arranged times and places,
FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4
directly by telephone. In addition, LIEMPTY-4 bas been
given s speciol extension in the Station through whicn he
‘may call as "Dr. Carlos" to leave a message for “Victor”
(FERNALD), The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact vith FERNALD in order te manage the oper-

ation and collect the product.

Goordination:

Ambassador NeBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY,

Future Plang:

1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to
produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons frequenting the Soviet Bmbassy, including Soviet
officials. Operational procedures and the project aecha-
nism vill continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation (see Changes, paragraph 2).

2, The Project does not include an up-dated plan for
energency contact during violent action or government over=
throw, The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters

in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.

- MEMORANDUM FOR ; Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

‘THROUGH 2 MPS/BG
SUBJECT "; Renewal of Project LIEMPTY

1. WH Division requests renewal of Mexico City Station's
Operational Support Project, LIEMPTY, for $23,635 for Fiscal
Year 1971 and a $10,498 amendment for FY 1970 to cover termine
ation payments to a former Principal Agent and his wife. Last
yoar LIEMPTY was approved for $38,970. One agont termination
and the transfer of the cost of a mobile surveillance unit to
another project are responsible for the reduced FY 1971 request.

2. ‘LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It includes a
Principal Agent, Raymond H. GERENDE (P), and 6 subagents who
maintain two separate safehouses, one in front and one in
the rear of the Soviet Embassy, from which anyone entering or
leaving the Embassy can be observed and photographed. The
various members of the team handle and service the photographic
equipment, develop’ and print photographs, keep observation
reports. and logs, including the arrival and departure of tar-
get persons, and maintain the two safehouses mentioned above.

3, This project does not provide positive intelligence,
except incidentally, It is designed to furnish a running
account, both photographic and in writing, of all Soviet
Embassy personnel and their visitors arriving at, or leaving,
the Embassy, Photographs taken by LIEMPTY personnel were
used to produce an updated "mugbook" on Soviet officials in ‘
Mexico which has been loaned to other US security agencies
for operational use in activities targeted against Soviet
services in Mexico City. LIEMPTY agents also provided infor-
mation which enabled the Station to identify the companions of
known KGB officials, to identify the habit patterns of new
arrivals at the Soviet Embassy and provided a wealth of other
information of operational value concerning Soviet Embassy

activities,

4. A security problem, resulting in a Station decision
to restrict the activities of GERENDE, place him on half pay,
and replace him with a career agent (a valuable asset who

seoner [*E



- SECRET it

also handles SB operations) arose during the project year.
GERENDE has been having marital difficulties which may end
Along with other incompatible features of the
marriage, which have resulted in numerous family fights,
there have been long, bitter and violent arguments to who

“ will ‘have custody of their 4 children and concerning a mone-

tary, settlements. :The Station has become involved in these
altercations. because GERENDE's wife is knowledgeable of his
CIA relationship and could, if she chose to do so, expose hia
as an agency employee. ~ She has promised to keep quiet but
there is no assurance that she will do so. In view of the
risk involved, should GERENDE's wife expose his agency rela-

tionship and in view of the fact that, despite his 15 years

of service and his undisputed ability and experience, other
unfavorable qualities militate against his retention, the
Station is considering terminating GERENDS. It is proposed
to pay him a términation bonus of $10,000 for 15 years of
service in accordance with Mexican Iaw and his wife $2,500 as
a security measure designed to keep her quiet, After discus-

-sion with the desk, FI Staff believes that, if GERENDE is

paid the $10,000 termination money, it should not be given to
him in one lump sum but should be paid on a monthly basis,
the amount per month to be determined by the Station, thus
eliminating the possibility of his squandering it all at

once and possibly coming back for more of the same, The same
procedure should be followed in the $2,500 payment to his
wife, In both cases at least an element of control is
assured in that both GERENDE and his wife will know that con-
tinued receipt of their monthly paymonts will depend upon
their continued loyalty to the agency. in the meantime, we
feel this man, whose morale, and ability have been seriously
affected by his marital strife, given time, can perhaps be
rehabilitated and once again become a valuable Station asset,
This would ensure his continued loyalty and give him an income
out of which to pay his alimony, Aside from the foregoing
there were no other problems, security or otherwise. Ali
meetings between the case officer and the new Principal Agent
are held under secure conditions, or more often if necessary,
at prearranged dates, times and places, Meetings between the
P/A and the subagents are held under similar conditions. The
Station has been requested to submit an updated emergency re-
contact plan to be included in the first FY 1971 quarterly

program report for this project.

5, Agents’ salaries, safehouse rentals, motor vehicle

“maintenance and travel, property maintenance and Christmas

bonuses will total $23,635. Despite the security aspects

: 5 JUN 1969
MEMORANDUN FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
THROUGH 3, MPS/BG
SUBJECT 2 FY 1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970

1. Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican
Station's operation which provides visual and photographic surveil~
lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance
and back of the building, as well as from a mobile unit. All Soviet
personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed.
From 1 November 1967 to 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photo-
graphs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were
completed by personnel in this project. SB Division is pleased with
the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds them
useful for operational purposes against the SB target. During the
past year several U.S. citizens entered the Soviet installation in
Mexico City and thetr photographs were identified by the FBI. There
is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City
and appropriately sterilized photographs are passed locally.

2. There have been no significant security problems.

3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of
one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and
termination of the agent who attended it. No real loss resulted from
this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken
from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse. The agent who
serviced the facility was getting too old to do an efficient job and
was terminated amicably. Also during the past year a new agent was
added to the project.

4, Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and
legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse
rental and eaintenance amounts to $6,188; maintenance of two vehicles,
$1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,500. FY 1969 approval
was for $43,520 and-estimated obligations for this period are $43,500.
A new, $5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in
FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year,

5. Project LIENPTY contributes substantially to. the Mexican
Station's SB-effort. The occasional identification of U.S. nationals
in contact with the Soviets could have an important bearing on National
Security. The operation ts handled by an experienced and capable,
outside contract agent under the direction of a Station officer which
.. provides good security and personne} economy. It is a well managed and

productive operational support mechanism necessary to a opera-
tions. FI Staff recommends approval,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans 4
SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal (FY 1970) :

1. Renowal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) in
the amount of $38,970, Funds are available in WH Division,

.2. LIEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operations
of the Mexico City Station, It provides for two basehouses,
a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic
and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy. Presently,
two fixed surveillance points near the Embassy provide the
location from which the photographs are taken and observers
are stationed, One basehouse is adjacent to the rear of the
Embassy, where Soviet officials meet, play and work, The
other basehouse is across the street from the front of the
Embassy and gives a direct view of every person entering or
leaving. There is also a mobile photographic unit (a VW
van) which is now used in support of all Mexico City Station
operations and in conjunction with the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team (used primarily against Soviet targets). Raymond H,
GERENDE, an indigenous contract agent, is the principal agent
of the operation and meets daily with the basehouse keepers

and subagents.

3. LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's
Soviet operations program and is considered an essential
element of the Station's support apparatus. During the
period 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, approxi-
matety 21,367 photographs were taken. In response to a
request to SB Division for an evaluation of the project, the
following comment was received: "There are few such sources
of high resolution photographs of Soviets, especially giving
good side views. These photos are welcomed by SB Division
since they furnish a steady flow of up-to-date identity
Gata..." The photos are useful to the Station in confirming
the identities of Soviet porsonnel and visitors to the

SECRET


- SECRET

Embassy, some of whom are U, S, citizens. During the past
year, severdl of these U, S, citizens were identified with .
the help of the photos (which were passed to the FBI}
Furthermore, the movements and habits of the Soviets are
studied, and more knowledge is acquired on their friends

_ and associates, especially Mexican nationals, This informa-
tion is useful in target studies. For example, the senior
TASS representative, a known KGB officer, is a recruitment
target. He is under intensive operational scrutiny for
leads developed from knowledge of his activities and contacts,
LIEMPTY support is an integral part of this current develop-

mental activity. :

-. 4. During the past year, one of the three basehouses
was closed, leaving two, and the agent attending it was
terminated. This was done because the agent was becoming
less effective with age, and because there was some over-
lap between the photos taken from this basehouse and those
of another. The termination was amicable, and the working
hours of the personnel of the other basehouse were extended
slightly. Another agent was also hired to help. This new
agent is of the same family as the rest of the personnel
occupying the basehouse, and no additional security risks are

anticipated from this addition,

5, ‘There have been:no security or administrative prob-
lems, The Station and GERENDS are constantly on the alert
for any sign that the Soviets are aware of the surveillance
activities, While it is quite possible that the Soviets are
aware of the surveillance, so far indications are that they
are at least not fully aware, since no effort is made by
them to avoid being photographed, even when having meetings
with contacts in the rear of the Embassy.

6. Approval is recommended of this valuable operational’
support project,

‘An operational support project providing three basehouses and
a mobile surveillance unit to monitor primarlly the Soviet
Embassy, its personnel and its visitors, by physical and photo=
graphic surveillance.

BACKGROUND: The project covers three properties near the Soviet Embassy

(two in front of the Enbassy's sole entrance and one behind the
garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried
out. It also covers a darkroom and @ mobile photographic truck.
Sone of the project personnel are used at times for miscellaneous
support tusks cuch as servicing postal boxes and for counter=
surveillance and other protective services.

During the past year the project provided nearly all of the opera-
tional photographs and physical surveillance reports used in the
Station's operations against the Soviet Embassy and its personnel.
SB Division says, "This rather unique operation has unquestionubly
made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet
Operations program of the Mexico Station."

The project produces primarily operational data and counterintelli-
gence information. It provides leads, evidence of which Soviet
officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away,
who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out
of the building with whom. (One photograph from this project was ”
used in the Warren Commission Report.)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY

1. WH Division requests renewal of LIEMPTY for the
19-month period 1 December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in
tho amount of $69,725, While this represents a slight
reduction-on a pro rata basis from the $45,000 for which
LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting
1 Decomber 1966, it reflects a proportionately modest
increase in cost for the 19-month renewal period over the
estimated total disbursement of $40,130 for the past
project year. This will provide for small salary increases
to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents
involved in the project who have not received raises in
some time as well as for slightly higher rental fees for
the various basehouses. The project, now in its tenth
year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection
of operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
-City, including the identification and movencnts of its
personnel and visitors. To this end, LIENPTY: provides
for the maintenance and exploitation of threé basehouses
for fixed visual and photographic surveillance of the
Soviet Embassy and a mobile basehouse in the form of a.
panel ‘truck used for mobile photography against the Polish
Embassy, leaders and mecting sites of local communist
parties, and other targets of opportunity. An important
corollary objective of LIEMPTY is operational support in
the form of countersurveillance for Agency personnel and
operations, including those of other bases and stations
as the needs and requirements of the Mexico Station permit.
The funds requested include $43,520 for the period 1
Décember 1967 through 30 November 1968 and an additional
$26,205 to cover the period 1 December 1968 through 30
June 1969, The latter funds are asked for in a supple-
mental request t6 put the project on a fiscal year basis.

2. A long-term contract agent and eight other support
agents are involved in the management and operation of the



LIEMPTY facilities and in surveillance activities directed
at the primary Sovict target. Some of these agents are
used also in dark room photographic processing, letter
drop, and, on occasion, moving surveillance activities.

3. This project is only part of the complex-of
Mexico City Station instruments for meeting requirements
from a number of U.S. agencies, including the FBI. It ~“
is clearly an effective, well-managed support operation
serving important needs.

4. No major or significant changes in LIEMPTY
personnel or operational techniques have been introduced
nor have there been any known incidents adversely
affecting. the. security of the project or its personnel
since the previous project renewal period. As a uni-
lateral operational support effort, LIEMPTY cont inues to
be a most useful station asset supporting a number of

station activities. In spite of small increases in costs
as discussed above, the project is considered to be holding
the line on cost and personnel.

5. The objectives of project LIEMPTY are in direct
support of priority A objectives 1, 2, and 4 of the current
Operating Directive for Mexico. It is considered by SB
Division to have made significant contributions to the
Station's well developed, high priority Sovict Operations
Program, During the past year the various LIEMPTY base-
house installations produced valuable information in the
form of photographic coverage and physical surveillance
reports on the daily movements, personal associations and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.

In numerous instances this coverage confirmed the specific
intelligence service connections of Soviet officers in the
Embassy. Often the identities of Mexicans and nationals of
other countries in contact with the Soviets were estab-
lished. The mobile panel truck unit was exploited regu-
larly to provide information on not only the Soviets but
also the Cuban target as well as local Communist Party

targets.

PROJECT BRIEFING
PROJECT: LIEMPTY . WH - Mexico City

AGTION : ADD/P approval of renewal 1 Dee 66 = 30 Nov 67

PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy
ahd a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily
against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders,

- PROGRESS: Three. baschouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) pro-
vide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy.
Throughout the past renewal period each operational component
contributed actively and concretely to the fulfillment of the
operational tasks levied on the Station, In the first nine-month
period approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational
photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These
served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and
their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement
and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The
mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1, 000 individual photo-
graphs, Of particular value were photographs of local and
exile Communist leaders, Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued
in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY, His overall
operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine meetings
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project

ws case officer,

PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/1, who owns a small store near the
Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached
him and asked him to inform on his neighbors, Reportedly the
Soviet named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name
and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC,
However, in view of LIGOWL's previous history of lying, it is
difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just
what LICOWL/1 may have told them, The Station is still looking

into this development,

that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be
getting "too close" to the project installations, personalities

and activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT 3 LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1, It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be
renewed for the period 1 December 1966 through 30
November 1967 for a total-of $45,000: $29,020 for
FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968, The Project is in-
cluded in the FY 1967 Operational Program for $45,000,
Funds are available within WH Division.

2. LIEMPTY covers stationary surveillance base-
houses targeted against the Sovict Embassy. These
basehouses provide photographic coverage and logs. Two
of the basehouses (LIMITED and LILYRIC) cover the
activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides
coverage of the back courtyard area, The LIEMPTY project
also covers a mobile photographic baschouse in the fora
of a panel truck which is used against the Polish Embassy
where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and
against other targets of opportunity.

3, The value of Soviet Embassy photographic cover-
age during the- past year was proven when the logs
maintained by LILYRIC were used to double check on-an
operation involving LIRUSTIC-1 and LICOWL~1 who had told
conflicting stories of certain events concerning the
activity of some Soviets. Through the surveillance
reports of the LIEMPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy,
it was proven without a doubt that LICOWL-1 (who had just
taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying
about his contacts with the Soviets.

4, The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was
targeted against leaders and meeting sites of the local
Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity,
particularly exile Communist leaders now residing in
Mexico. LIENTRAP provided up-dated identification

: oe
photographs of Communist officers which are of value
to both the JNTIGER program and the Station's 4
recruitment/penctration program. The LIENTRAP :
personnel also regularly service twenty-one postal
Accommodation addresses used by the Mexico City

Station,

S.. One development which may affect the security
of the LIEMPTY baschouses of LIMITED and LILYRIC
occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-1 (who owns a small
store near the Sovict Embassy) reported that a Soviet.
official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and i
requested him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly |
the Soviet named LIEMPTY-6 (of the LIMITED basehouse) ,
by name and also indicated all the tenants (unnamed) |
of the new building which now houses LILYRIC, The
Soviet pinpointed the building by saying the one being!
built by a person who fit perfectly the description of
LIMOUSINE, LICOWL-1 did not indicate that the Soviet
reflected any interest in LIMOUSINE. The occupants of
the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned, LICOWL-1
indicated to his Station contact that the only person
he really suspected ian the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6
(of LIMITED) who doesn't go to work, is always typing,
lives comfortably. and owns a car, He claims to have
heard it rumored that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the
Americans, (Since LIMITED is equipped with a radio
and tips off the Station's surveillance team when it
is used against Soviet targets, Headquarters has
already assumed that the Soviets have identified this
baschouse.) LICOWL-1 also listed several persons
named by the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever

with CIA.

6. The Station instructed LICOWL-1 not to become
an informant on his neighbors, According to LICOWL-1,
he therefore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to
collect the information the Soviet wanted. However,
in view of the lies LICOWL-1 has been caught in, it
is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked
of LICOWL-1 and just what LICOWL-1 may have told the
Soviets. The Station is still looking into this develop-

ment.
7. WHD recommends renewal of this Project.

ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal 1 Dee 65 = 30 Nov 66

PURPOSE: To provide support for mobile and stationary photographic
surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and a dispatching base
for a physical surveillance team.

PROGRESS: Assets included under the project include three base-
houses which provide front and rear views of the Soviet
Embassy, and a panel truck equipped for spot photo
coverage. Naymond H. GERENDE (p), principal agent,
mcets the baschouse keepers regularly, maintains regular
contact with the mobile photo unit and with tho develope
ing and processing base. He also performs many other
support functions.

The phetographs from all these operations have been of
value to the Station in operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, and
for Headquarters permanent files. The Station believes
that this operation is essential to the fulfillment of
the overall operational program levied on the Station by

the RMD.

‘THROUGH: ppP/PG
SUBJECT: Project LISMPTY Rereval

1. FI Staff recomends approval of the reneval of Project
LIEMPTY. This project, costed at $41,500., supports the following
Mexico City assets: a panel truck used for mobile photography,
three base houses for fixed photographic surveillance, a contract

agent manager and eight support agents. One of the base homes is
used as a control point to dispatch a surveillance team. (The

latter is not a part of the project, however.)

2. The LIEMPTY target is the Soviet Embassy and Soviet
activities in Mexico City. LISYPIY is part of the complex of
station instruments by means of wiieh requirements from a variety
of U.S. agencies are met. One cf the sites provided pictures
later used in the Warren Cousission Report, and the publication
of the report created a security hazard. ‘The Station moved the
site and it is now back in operation.

3. The possibility of Soviet intercept of radio commo to
the surveillance team has been carefully veighed recently by SR,
the desk, 0/C and TSD. The decision to accept the risk appears
to have been taken with due deliteration.

4, This is clearly an effective, well-managed operation
serving an important need. We recomend renewal without hesitation,

MENORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT © : Project LIEMPTY Renewal Request

1, Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1906 for a
total of $41,500; of this amount, $25,520 should be
alloted for FY 1966 and $15,980 for FY 1967, This Project
has been programmed in FY 1966 for $50,000.. The last
Project Renewal was approved at $45,300, Funds are
available within WH Division,

2, The security of this Project appears to be good.
The LIENTRAP photo truck was repainted a different color
in January 1965 to preserve the security of this vehicle
which operates extensively in the same general arcas, There
have been no apparent ramifications from the publication
of the LIMITED Photograph in the Warren Commission Report

in September 1964,

3. LIENTRAP is one of two mobile photo surveillance
units at the Station, both of which are used extensively
because of the many requirements for spot photo coverage
of diplomatic installations, agent mectings, and current
identification photos of targets among others.

“4, Although there are three stationary photo
baschouses under this Project all targeted against the
Sovict Embassy, there is very little duplication of
effort, and the coverage of this Embassy would be weakened
through the termination of any of them, LICALLA covers
the rear of the Embassy (garden and parking lot) and is
in a unique position to observe informal meetings and
activity there, In May 1965 a thorough assessment was
made of this basehouse to determine whether an audio
installation could be based here, directed against these i
garden conversations, It was determined that due to the
high incidence of street and other noises, this was not
practical, TSD and SR Divisions are conscious of this
requirement, however, and if any new equipment is
developed which might make this ‘operation more feasible
it will be tested, LIMITED and LILYRIC which both cover
the front entrance, provide coverage during different
parts of the day, and LIMITED also serves as a fixed radio

dispatching base for the LIEMBRACE surveillance tean,

5. The photographs from all these operations are of
value to the Station in their operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, which
are often used by surveillance tears and singleton agents
in identifying Soviets, and for Headquarter's peranent
files.”

6. With reference to the FI Staff comment made last

year at the time of the Project renewal that the radio dis-
atching from the LIMITED installation might have rade this
ase a target for the RIS, the problem was discussed in depth
with the Office of Comrunications, TSD, and SR Divisions,
The Statios: has been alert to the Soviet's monitoring capa-
bility and they have ee rcrerca a@ siynaling system and inter-
car communications system that will leave the LIEMSRACE
surveillance cars on the air for a minimum of tine, and
with limited open conversation, The result of Headquarters
and the. Station's research on this problem resulted in the
conclusion that, if a surveillance team is to operate with
automobiles, radios must be used if there is to be efficient
surveillance, and regardless of what presently availak le
type of scrazbling or coding is used, radio is susceptible
to monitoring by the opposition, It was therefore concluded
that if the Station is to use the LIEMBRACE tean against
members of the Soviet installation, LIMITED must continue to
be used as the radio dispatching center and the ri factor
must be accepted until some new, more secure yet efficient
commo system is devised,

7, The reporting en the administration of this Project
is handled through regular quarterly progress reperts, The
appropriate Soviet, CP, or other Case Officers handle the
reporting and exploitation of the product. During the past
year there were no ‘positive intelligence reports from this

Project,

8. Both SR and WH Divisions recommend renewal of this

Project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief ‘of Operations, DD/P

SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY (Renewal)
WH - Mexico City

1. The attached project, originating in WH Division,
is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1960
through 30 November 1961. The project provides for physi-
cal and photographte surveillance operations in support
and exploitation of other Mexico City Station operations,
particularly those targetted at Soviet perscnnel and in-

stallations.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $53,000 from
the DD/P-WH Division budget: $31,900 In fiscal year 1961,
and $21,100 in fiscal year 1962, subject to the avaitlabil-
ity of funds. The amount includes $38,000 compensation
for two principal agents, one clerical support agent on an
hourly basis, and eleven surveillance and support agents;
$7,000 operational expenses (safehouse procurement, post
office boxes, rented automobiles, purchase of information,
vehicle maintenance, and operational travel); $2,500 re-
placement, repair and maintenance of photographic equip-
ment; and $5,500 basehouse rental, utilities, and mainte-

nance.

3. The field's renewal request, supported by a cover-
ing memorandum of the Division, sets forth accomplishments
of the project in the past year in terms of objectives and
estimates effectiveness, It is noted that one principal
agent, Simon D. CLACKETT (p), resigned in October 1960, and
the four-man surveillance team previously handled by him
will be transferred to project LITEMPO, comsequently being
omitted from LIEMPTY in this renewal. Three basehouses con-
tinue to be operated under the project: (a) LIMITED, which :
compiles daily logs on arrivals and departures from the
LIMERICK installation, together with attendance lists of
LIMERICK employees, and handles the radio dispatch of the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets

of opportunity. ‘This basehouse also provides photographic
coverage, concentrated en visitors. (b) LILYRIC which pro-
vides clandestine photographs particularly of visitors -to,
as well as employees of, the LIMERICK installation, prepares
weekly reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives, and
reports on license numbers of sil cars visiting the instal-
lation. (c) LICALLA, which concentrates on photographic
coverage of LIMERICK employees and their families, as well
as providing observation on the apparent positions and jobs
of the target employees, and 3s well as personnel changes,
Additional photographic coverage is provided by the mobile
LIENTRAP vehicle. Principal agent Raymond H. GERENDE (p)
continues to coordinate basehouse activities; principal
agent Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) ccntinues to be an independent
asset used to follow-up and explo!t operational information
on target personnel and installations, to case various in-
stallations of interest, to acquire property, etc. SCANTLING
has managed the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO in the interim rollowing the resignation of CLACKETT.
The Station notes that activities at the LICALLA basehouse
were suspended in Septemter 1960 as the result of the ar-
rest of a knowledgeable TSD technictan in another area and
it is not known precisely when it will be possible to re-
sume these operations. The Station believes that the
GERENDE segment is now operating under optimum arrangements
and SCANTLING will scon be relieved from his interim respon-
sibllity for the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO and can concentrate more on his investigative and
casing activities. It is not planned in the coming year to
expand project activities.

4, Appropriate Special Staf components concur in rec-
ommending renewal. FI Staff notes the Division's assurance
that the transfer of the unilateral surveiliance team to
LITEMPO will not affect its Independent status, and remarks
that the current project review presents a clearer picture
of the usefulness of the several segments than the previous

one,

contract to provida him with a termination settlenent of one month's salary for
each full year that he works for KUBARK and to raise his salary effective July
1959 from 3,020 to 74,560.00 ver year. !4s last salary increase was granted on
1 Serterber le57. The date, 18 arch 1958, bas been sugsested by the Station as

Station believes that this benefit will nrovide CERENDE with the necessary
incentive to mike KUBARK a career and at the same tine will give the Station an

additional elecent of control.

1, The attached project, originating in WH Division, 1s presented
‘for your approval for an initial period from 1 December 1958 through
30 November 1959. -The project provides for the development of operational
information through physical and photographic surveillance operations in
support of other Mexico City operations, particularly those targetted at ~
Soviet personnel and installations. Previously these operations were con-
-ducted for the most part under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY. They are
incorporated in this new project because of the June 1958 compromise of
LIPSTICK and to accomplish a more orderly administration of certain opera-
tional support assets.

2, Authority 1e requested to obligate $95,380 from the DD/P-WH
Division operating budget: - $65,580 for the current fiscal year and
$29,800 in fiscal year 1960, subject to the availability of funds. These
estimates include: (a) funds for the compensation of the presently-
recruited fifteen action and support agents, six new agenta, and tvo
principal agente: Raymond H, GERSNDE (p) (LIEMPIY/1, formerly LIPSTICK/20)
and Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) (LIEMPTY/2, formerly LIPSTICK/19); (b) funda

3. The attached Meld Project Outline, a covering memorandum from the
Division, and an addendum to the Project Cutline, review the personnel assets
and facilities tranaferred from the LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY operations following
tho partial compromise of LIPSTICK in June 1958 and describe the concept of
the physical and photographic eurveillance operations to be conducted under
thia project directed prinarily at the Soviet Kubasey in Mexico City. These
aurveillances provide photographé and other operational data of persone entering
and leaving the building or procont in the garden area, and through additional ~
foot and mobile curvefllances, investigative information concerning their
contacts and destinations. Agent personnel, particularly the principal egente,
are used algo to conduct separate investigations, make recruit-approaches to



individuals of operational interest, and to rent rooas, and apartment and
perform other support activities, The fixed surveillance bases, LIMITED,

4. The CI Staff comments that LIEMPIY provides several types of physical
surveillance, all of vhich provide information of CI interest, and as a support
7 mechanism, a production review {9 not appropriate cr_necessary. The CI Staff
states further, that vith the compromise of the LIPSTICK surveillance team
the Mexico City Station lost its only reliable ani efficient surveillance team,
LISMPTY representing the Station's effort to repisce that asset. Pecause of
the great number of CI targets in Nexico City, the CI Staff believes it is
essential that the Station be given the opportunity, through this project, to
build another surveillance team capable of operating ageinst sensitive targets,
additionally, the CI Staff believes the case officer should work at devising
ostensible sources of incomes for the agents vhich vill stand the acrutiny of

friends, relatives and lesa friendly forces.

5. FI/OPS suggests that the Division consider a gradual reduction of the
considerable financial and personnel commitments in this project in view of
the favorably developing LIENYCY liaidon relationship. FI/CPS believes that
a smaller, more manageable support group, with grester Station emphasis on
selectivity ef tarks and targets could well result in more effective CT and

FI productivity.



6. I recommend approval of the project and the transfer of tho
contract agents as outlined above. The Division is requested to take
cognizance of the ouggestions-of the CI Steff and FI/OPS in the para-
grephs above relative to the security and the overall direction of the
surveillance activities to make then xore efficient.

Requect for Anendrent to LIEMMTY Project

1, It ds requested that the LIEMPTY Project approval request be
amended to include Simbn D. CLACKETT (ps) and ilma J. FIORCALISI (ps),
U. S. citizens and contract agents, under this Project in place of the
Staff Agent written into the field project outline, At the same tine it is
requested that the LIVHSA Froject be amended to delete these contract
agents from the latter project. :

2, CLACKETT and FIORUALISI are. now approved under the LIMESA Project.
They were recruited in the United States to occupy a sensitive LIMHSA base—
house. Hecause of the sensitivity of the operation ani the equicment to be
installed in the basehouse Headquarters decided U, S. citizens should be
used. The Station sald appropriate documentation and backstooping could
be secured for those agents 50 they could be given false identities under
which they could live while they occupied the bazehouse,

3. ¥EXI-2777 (1N 26519), of 14 Novenber 1958, notified Headquarters
that security factors and difficulty in obteininy adequate documentation
and backetopping precluded tie use of U. S. citizens under LIMASA and re~
quested permiesion to use indigenous agents for this operation. After dis=
cussions between John BR.D., Chief of the Kexican desk, with the LIMESA/
LIEMPTY Case Officer in Mexico City, and discussions between representa~
tives of F1/D, 0%, [SS, and WH at Hesdquarters, Headquarters concurred in
the field's operational decision to use indigenous agente in the LINECA
Project. CLACsETT and FIOFDALISI received only a very superficial briefing
regarding the LIMESA Project. It is not believed Subject's linited know~
edge of this sensitive operation will pose a security hazard,

4, Construction on the LIMGST houses is being kept about two weeks
from completion until indigenous agents can be cleared and recruited. The
delay in completion is normal bersuse all construction money in Mexico has
become extremely tight because of tne recent presidential inauguration,

5 The Station believes CLACAETT will be an excellent replacement for
Wilfred 0. CLC.EX (ps), former Staff Agent under Project LIPSTICK, who
directed and trained that surveillance team, CiaChEi? has shown a remarkable
aptitude for clandestine operational activity and surveijlance and investi-
gative work in particular. He also is interested and enthusiastic in under-
taking this assignment for KUZ.RK, The Station needs a good bilingual ayent
to recruit, train, direct, and develop a strong dependable physical. surveil~
lance team under LIEHTY,

6. Clearances and Contacts: CLACKETT was granted a PCSA on 23 July 1958.
A POA/OA for use under LIMESA was requested on 19 Auyust 1958, FICKUALISI
was grarted an Os for use under LIMESA on 14 November 1958, Requests have
been submitted to amend their clearances for use under LIENPTY. CLaCkEIT
and FIOKLALISI have signed contracts effective 1 September 1958. The
sensitivity of the LIMbSA Project required them to leave their young son in

the United Stutes.’ Because of this a special benefit of periodic trips to
their hone in Arizona vas included in their contrects. Under LIMESA their
quarters were to be provided, an azendent has been requested to their

contracts deleting the special benefit and adding educational and quarters

allowances,

7. Motivation and Control: CIACKETT and FIORDALISI are extremely
patriotic and highly motivated as evidenced in their willingness to under-
take the LIMESA Project and be separated from their son, They have indie
cated they are more than willing to do whatever is requested of them, no
matter. what: personal sacrifices and hardships are required. Their com-
plete livlihood is dependent on their KUS.RK income.

8. Tasks: CLACKETT will recruit, train, and direct the LIENPTY
surveillance team, ‘The Station hopes to develop this team into a major
Station support asset, ie «ill receive instructions and direction from the
Station Case Officer, FICRDALJSI will be used to do all the clerical and
administrative work for the Lil surveillance team,

9. Comunication and Gont:et: CLACKETT will contact the Station Case y,

Officer in a clandestine manner, All necessary security precautions will be
taken, CLACKEIT will also contact his surveillance agents umer a cover
which will be determined later ty the Station and CLACKETT. In view of his
Mexican tackground, CLACKBTT can pass as a Mexican, Details of communication
and contact arrangements with KCSiSK will be arranged by the Station, Under
LIEHPTY CLATKETT will be contacted by the same Case Officer he is now con=
tacted by under LIMESA, CLACKSTT and FIORDALISI will be in direct contact
with relatives and friends in the United States. The cover company has,
until now, been serving as a letter drop and contact point for emergency

messages.

10, Cover: CLACKETT and FIORDALISI entered Mexico on United States
documentation and it is planned they will continue to live in Mexico under.
true name, CLACASTI has a notional cover as a public relations consultant
which was established by CCD/NC to use with friends and relatives in the U. S.
The same cover story can be adosted to cover tueir proposed use under LI2iPTY
vis-a-vis their United States friends. The Station is working on local cover
for CLaChETT to use in Mexico.

11, Anticdnated Costs: It is anticipated thst the following expenses

2, Authority 4s aleo requested to purchase a panel truck:to be used
in the LIENTRAP operation under this Project which mounts mobile photo-
graphic surveillances,

3. It Ae also requested that a quasi-personal car be authorised for
Oliver G, Scantling (ps), Scantling is an indigenous agent under oral
contract, A car is a prerequisite for his work for KUBARK which includes
¢easings, survedllances, and investigations. Because of the sensitive
nature of his work, and the heavy use made of the car, the Station has
decided that Scantling should be furnished a QP car.

: 4. LIEMPTY agents were formerly carried under the LIJERSEY and
LIPSTICK Projects, The vehicles used by the LIEMPTY agents under these
other Projects will bs: disposed of ani new ones will be purchased after
the above TVA has been approved. ‘The vehicles which will be replaced
are MV 2148, MV 2147, MV 2138, and MV 2031, One of the surveillance
cars will be new and will not replace an old car, It was decided that
these vehicles should be replaced rather than transferred to the LIEPTY
Project for socurity reasons and because of the age of the automobiles,
The automobiles are 1951 and 1952 models and have been used for sensitive

surveillance work for over two years, The panel truck which was used in

the LIENTRAP Operation under the LIPSTICK Project has been operating for
two years in all parts of the city and has become a security threat. The
fact that the LIPSTICK surveillance teaa knows that the truck exists,

even to the point that one of the team meabers is the listed ower af the
truck, aleo dictates replacement of this vehicle.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Chief, WH Divisfon
SUBJECT: KDOFACTOR Project Amendment and Termination

1. The KOFACTOR Project, which provided photographic
survefllance from two vantage pofnts of the Soviet compound
in Mexico City, was determined to be compromised due to the
VWBLANKET case. The five agents were terminated in July
1972, but the base houses could not be terminated until
January 1973 because {t was necessary to sell one and the
termination of the second was tied to the termination of
KDABBEY who owned the second base house. It was necessary
to pay rent for several extra months until these other
terminations could be effected.

2. The base houses and agents have now all been tere
minated and the Station already has rented a replacement,
safehouse with new agents to provide the same coverage
(KDALCOVE).

3. Approval of the amendment and termination of

Project KOFACTOR fs recommended.

“MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT: Security Review of Project KDFACTOR

1. At the time you approved the renewal of Project
.-'. . KDFACTOR in December 1971 you asked that the Station
conduct an updated security review of this operation,
which provides photographic surveillance of the Soviet
Fey Embassy in Mexico City. You asked that particular atten-
tion be paid to terminated agents and their families.
The Station has made a security review and a detailed
report on the findings, from Chief, WH Division, is

attached,

2. The report discusses the history of the opera-
tion, describes security problems of the past and steps
taken to remedy them, and discusses the security and
operational situation of the agents presently covered
by the project. The report notes that the two opera-
tional sites and their associated agents are compart- ~
mented from each other and that processing the film is
now being done inside the Station. One section of the
report discusses in, detail the assets who were formerly
involved in these operations but have been terminated.
The final section of the report describes current secu-
rity: practices and notes that an alternate photographic
surveillance site has been procured and is available
for use should the present one be compromised.

3. The report demonstrates that the security of
the operation is being kept up to high standards and
that there are no potential security threats from
former agents that the Station is not aware of. The
FI Staff believes that the Station's security review

; and the attached report satisfy the requirements of

your request.

SUBJECT : FI Project KDFACTOR, Security Review

REFERENCE : ADDP Memo (DD/P 1-5899) to C/WHD dated
14 December 1971

1, In response to reference the following is a summary of the
KDFACTOR security review:

The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is
as follows:

"There were no known problems of security relating to
the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have
reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project
security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for
many years and have established themselves as respectable long-
time residents of the area, All five assets, four in one family
and one in another, are’ extremely security conscious and have :
all been SGSWIRLED. The assets derive a substantial portion
of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus :
lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina-
tion of their work for us., As an additional safeguard, the
KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that
either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence",

The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the
KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security i
is sound, In fact, as presently constituted, the KDFACTOR :
Project is well compartmented, and each of the two KDFACTOR
photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long~ :
term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational ioe
activities. Terminated assets could possibly expese the existence

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters

review of terminated agents witting of present KDFACTOR

. operational activities, A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
could result in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts
of KDABBEY:-1, the owner of an apartment building and four
houses close to the Soviet Embassy, It is doubtful that KDABBEY-1's
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the
KDFACTOR agents, would in any way nee the KDFACTOR
Project operational activities,

2, A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:

The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LUERSEY
and LIPSTICK Projects, both active In the mid-1950's, In 1958, after
the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided
to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy,
These asséts were consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet
. Embassy and one surveillance team from the LLJERSEY Project into a new
project-(LIEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959, The LIEMPTY.
Project, tenamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo
“basehouses, two viewing-the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and
LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA),
plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED
basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.

2 In 1959 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team
members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the security of the project nor expose any
of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations, (Note: As the basehouse operations
were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence, }

The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until ae
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964, In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse, The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept~
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security
precaution, In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

SECRET

i ie

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the
owner, KDABBEY-l, From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet ~

. Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular photographic sur-

veillance, |

: Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC
basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the |
same view, In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and
LIEMPTY-6, ‘the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP
‘eoverage of Soviet vahicular movement monitored and directed from the
LIMITED basehouse, With the.closing of LIMITED and the Station decision
to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who
handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile
surveillance team was underemployed, and the decision was made to move
it to the LIEMBRACE Project, This was done in early 1970, svon after
GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December

1969,

The photo processing of the KDFACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY) ~
film take is now being done by the Station, In the past, it was done by
the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-1, who was terminated
amicably in early 1971, The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly
LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by KDABBEY-! for
the Station, KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly
by KDABBEY-1! but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-
house for FID's KDVAULT Project. The apartment building housing the
KDABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by
KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in
maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses.
The LIMITED photo basehouse was qlso located on KDABBEY-1's property

when it was active, i

The individual basehouse operations are and have always been
compartmented one from the other, The only points of breakdown in the
compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to
the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b)) KDFACTOR-1 was processing
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of their
exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the KOFACTOR
operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G. SCANTLING,
Station contract agent retired in 1971, was aware of the KDFACTOR Project

through his past work with LIEMPTY-6 and with GERENDE on KDFACTOR
Project activities; and (e) the fact that the two present basehouse properties
are owned by KDABBEY-1, who is witting of the locations and general
activity of both KDFACTOR basehouses, .

Regarding the security of the above active KDFACTOR agents,
the. KDLITERAL basehouse is handled by KDFACTOR-2 with the assistance
of his wife, KDFACTOR-10. They have a long-time maid and a 13-year-
old son who lives with them in the basehouse, Neither the son nor the maid
is believed to be witting. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked
room, and the product is kept in a locked safe. KDFACTOR-2 was recruited
by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the
KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's
security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the
former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team
members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information
regarding LIPSTICK surveillance activities, LIPSTICK-47 was terminated
in late 1958 and is believed to have withheld from the police the information
regarding KDFACTOR-2 and the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-2
and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and
have been discreet and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors
and relatives,


SECRET -

7 \

i The -KDABSINTHE basehouse is manned by KDFACTOR-S, his
wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KOFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR-9.
The. SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is witting of :
KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station, The result was that his immediate
family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,
are aware of the photographic operation, KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by
LIEMPTY-I2, a U.S. citizen with a private company in Mexico City who.
is no longer working with the Station but who ig considered patriotic and
no threat to KDFACTOR security.

4, Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present ce Security:
A. Raymond H, GERENDE

GERENDE is a ‘Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination on 26 June 1970, He had been employed by the Station
intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities,
Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project ‘in 1958 GERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and
processing films,.and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent, In'1969, after years of-excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,
KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used
operationally but was maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-
ceedings would be completed quickly, When it became apparent the divorce
would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE

- and his wife. Bruce H, FERNALD, career agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments, GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where
he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees
of two local firms, He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970. It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class
schedule has been cut back, The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-
tion that would indicate GERENDE has violated his secrecy agreement,

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968, A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,
Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee. The persons investigated

SECRET


SECRET 7

-%-

included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet
investigation, It is unclear from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet-investigation of GERENDE had proceeded, Nechiporenko

. waS PNG‘d from Mexico in March 1971, GERENDE's possible exposure to
the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as
@ translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range of support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets,

3B. KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)

1 ae KDFACTOR-7 is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of
GERENDE, She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children,
She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE, She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE’s activities regarding the KDFACTOR
Project, She was-terminated on 26 June 1970 and signed both a secrecy
agreement and quit claim, After termination it became apparent that she
had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financial‘problems between her family and GERENDE. While the Station
was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was
involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a
large part of which came covertly from the Station, In July 1870 KDFACTOR-7
came to the Agency Headquarters and complained about her financial settle-
ment, In September and November.1970 she wrote two letters directly to
the Agency on the same subject, In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business. In January 1971 the Agency contacied
KDFACTOR-''s brother, a U. S; Army civilian with a "Top Secret” clearance
living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-
understandings with KOFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station
reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social
secretary with the Department of State-at the Embassy, It is believed that
this job has probably solved many of her financial problems and should also
inhibit her from exposing her past work with the Mexico City Station, as
such exposure could jeopardize her job, The Embassy in the Hague was
briefed in general terms on KDFACTOR-7's background,

C. KDFACTOR-1

KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law
of GERENDE, He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in
processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time
the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPTY Project), KDFACTOR-1



Ss

was later assisted in processing the photographie take by his wife,
LIEMPTY-5, whois GERENDE's sister, KDFACTOR-1 was terminated
isi March 1971, arid the photographic processing previously done by
KDFACTOR-1 is-now doné‘in the Station. The termination was amicable

_ and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-I's medical

practice expanded, “ There does not appear to be any security problem
in the termination of KDFACTOR-1 as he is discreet and also a close
relative of GERENDE. The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-!'s

. medical office was good as KDFACTOR-I's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist-

‘ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom.

D, LIEMPTY-5

LIEMPTY-5 was hiréd by the Station in 1957 to assist
KDFACTOR-1 with the processing of KDFACTOR films, She is the sister
of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-1l. She was terminated along with
KDFACTOR-1 in March 1971, Due to her close relationship with GERENDE
and KDFACTOR-I, she is not considered a ihreat to the Project Security,

E, Oliver G. SCANTLING

SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station
agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 1971,
SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the
Station in recent-years Jargely because his strong motivation to work
against the Communists. SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team
leader {rom 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project
from 1958 through 1966. He was the cut-out to LIEMPTY-6 and a back-up
principal agent for GERENDE. SCANTLING's termination was amicable,
and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR

Project.
_F, LIEMPTY-6

LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station
asset, was retired.in May 1968, He had manned the LIMITED photo base-
house with his wife and son assisting him, He had been working with the
Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency,
LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the
names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses,
While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities
up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on
his Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-
in-law, He is not considered a threat to the security of this Project,

SECRET



= SECRET

There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking
“out the-LIMITED photo basehouse and may have had suspicions. concerning
LIEMPTY-6, This was a report by KDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav
Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Soviet Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE-
10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed
interest-in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the
KDABSINTHE photo basehouse,. but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-
house keepers by‘name. Siinikov did name specific persons he was inter-
ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6, KDADAGE-10, of unknown .
reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information, but added that,
between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard
it rumored he worked for the Americans, In 1966 Headquarters already
assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was
used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case,
the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968, It is bélieved
this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current
KDFACTOR assets,

5.. Current KDFACTOR Security Practices:

The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE
remain compartmented, as they-have been throughout the history of the
Project. The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly
with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITE RAL basehouse, and with
KDFACTOR-5, responsible for the KDABSINTHE baschouse, In these
meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries
and handles miscellaneous administrative matters, These are car meetings
usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup puints are changed
regularly. Meeting time is kept toa minimum and meetings are pre-

. Scheduled whenever possible, The photographic product is processed in
the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling
over the past practice of having KDFACTOR-1 process it in his office
darkroom, The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5;
however, in emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse
can be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are com-
promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing
the KDABSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KDCALVERT
Project as residents, This new apartment offers as good a vantage point

A. Cperational ,

1, The a change during the preceeding: period has been
the closing of the LIMITSD basehouse and the termination of
LIEMPTY=". This has resulted in considerable financial
saving with no loss in elliciency==to the contrary, as a
walter of fact, The major reason for the change was the
fact that LTEMPTY-» was growin less reliable with age. He
S$ not always able to be on the job, and when he was, his
xed surveillance reporting was occasionally inaccurate,
and his photorraphy often poor, There had been
considerable overlap between LILYRIC and LIMITED report tag,
and with the closing of LU!ITsD, the LULYRIC working hours
were extended slightly so that full working howrs of the
FISTEAL tastallation continued to be covered, ‘The only
disadvantage fo this arrangement is that the vantare point
ol the KJSTEM. installation which had ween shared by :
LINITLD and LILYRIC will now go .uncoyered during pertods of
annual leave by LILYRIC personnel (the LILYRIC personnel
are all embers of one family and nomially take their

leave together),

2. There have been no changes in the operating procedures
and techniques of LUsMPTY=% in the LICALLA baschouse, The
refinenents described in the previous Project Cutline have
been etfective and have been maintained, The same can be
said of LISSTRAP, which has become a much more flextole
tool since its partial interration into the LIZMBRACE team,
There have been no changes in LTLYRIC procedures, other
than expansion of coverage to include the entire working

week,

exarple of the importanec of LILYRIC coverage, it was LILYRIC
photes which made possible the identification of a WCLADY
citizea who had been in clandestine contact with an AEGRIP
ofticer, This ‘information was turned over to LNERGO, which
was pursuing the case, In general, LILYRIC provides the
Station with a Jarse percentage of the CI raw material if
collected on the FUSTEAL tarcet, such as automobile license
hunters, PCS and TDY arrivals-wmt-departures, unusual
activities such as demonstrations, unusual or lengthy

absences of personnel, etc, This information also has
positive operational value, but its most important use {s as
the major source of identification of FISTHAL personnel and

PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

During the Project year under review there were no known incidents
which adversely aijected the security of Project LIewry or the

related personnel, The termination of LINMPTY-0 caused no problems,

nor did the construction of a maid's roon on the roor of the LICALLA
installation, adjacent to LIAMPTY-9's oieto point, There Is no
indication that FJSTEAL personnel had any suspicions about the
construction work. The sure of a LIENBRACH surveillance

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director Plans
SUBJECT: Suppleuentary Appropriation for LIEMPTY

It is requested that the figures in the attached
field-project renewal be amended and that an additional
$26,205 be approved to cover the period 1 December 1968
through 30 June 1969. in order to carry the LIEMPTY Project
to the end of a fiscal year, This sum is identical to that
requested for a similar period in 1968 as there is no
present justification for projecting any change in the
financial requirements. The supplement would bring the
cost of LIEMPTY to a total of $69,725 for 19 months.

MEMORANDUM FOR; Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1. Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for the period’ 1 Decem-
ber 1967 through 30 November 1968 in the amount of $43,520
is hereby requested. $26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and
$17,315 in FY-1969. The project was budgeted for $45,000 for
FY 1968; funds are available within the Division, Estimated

. costs for the coming project year are a little less than the
amount programmed for the previous year and a little more
than what was actually | disbursed, Peer

2. LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveil-
lance of the Sovict Embassy in Mexico City. It covers three
Nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance
and one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic
surveillance are carried. out by experienced personnel, The
project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes
the photographs. In addition to collecting this basic informa~
tion on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel
are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such as
servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving surveil-
lances, The photo truck which comes under the project is
used on other targets as well, such as CP members, satellite
embasSies, and Latin American exile: One of the basehouses
is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRACE sur-
veillance team, but this function has been minimized during
the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of

the signal.
3. a. The Mexican desk asked the appropriate opera-

tional component of SB Division for specific comment on the
value of LIEMPTY, and received the following:

"This rather unique operation has
unquestionably made a major contribu-
tion to the increasingly effective
Soviet Operations program of the
Mexico Station. On the positive
side its principal value lies. in the
identification of the Mexican and

third national contacts of the Soviets,
' i from which we must select and develop : :
i the access agents so vital to our oper-
5 ations against the Soviet human target.
. LIEMPTY also provides us with a much
: ‘clearer picture of the inner relation-
f Ships-and activity patterns within the
Sovict mission itself, which in turn
facilitates effective targeting. The
CE value of a LIEMPTY type project as
@ monitor of real and potential agent
contacts is of course obvious, It is
important to note that LIENPTY is not,
as might be the case In stations of
i lesser overall capability, a simple
case of photography (or observation)
for the record, Rather it is an import-
| ant facet of a concerted high priority
effort to-get at and recruit individual
Soviets."

Station reporting has been in a similar vein.
Information produced is largely for operational purposes and
we often lack detail as to specific utility in a given situ-
ation, although we can produce statistics on numbers of photo-
graphs produced and numbers of pages of surveillance notes.
It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they
have received from LIEMPTY a great many reports on American
callers at the Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double

agent operations.

c. During a conversation on 8 December 1967, the
officer who heads the station's SB section told the branch
that. LIEMPTY is basic and essential to all of his branch's
operational planning, that he "grabs the LIEMPTY material
first thing in the morning" and studies it for leads, evidence
of which Soviet officers have been in the Embassy ang which
ones have been away, who has used which car, who has been talk-
ing to whom or going out of the building with whom, etc. etc,
New additions to the Embassy staff can be tabbed as KGB or
GRU by their associates, their activity patterns and the cars [
they drive, (The I,8, men are often away from the Embassy,
while the legitimate FSO's tend to spend more time in their
Offices, The KGB, GRU and regular diplomatic groups seldom
cross lines but ‘stay within their own tight groups. >) When :

SECRET


“double agents are turned over from one case officer. to a new
one, known to them only in alias, we are often able, through
surveillance and photographs, to establish the true identity
of the new case officer, as was done in the case of AEGIMMICK

in the spring of 1967.

4. In assessing the security of the operation, the
station assumes that: the Soviets realize that they are being
. watched, as was.evidenced by a Soviet officer's trying to
hield-an FBI-directed walk-in from observation. There have
been rumors that anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photo-
graphed, but no allegations that the Americans are doing it
have come to our attention; the probable assumption is that
the Mexicans arc doing this. A former source who lives in
the neighborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew
about LIBMPTY/6, one of the safchousekeepers, and the Soviets
have said they think he is watching them. On the security of
the LICALLA safehouse there is a difference of opinion.
GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks the Soviets are
aware that they are being observed from this post, but station
disagrees and produces good justification for its views, cit-
ing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not
shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks,
We have no evidence that Soviet interest is any threat to the
operation; rather 1t may be assumed that they accept the sur-

veillance as a fact of life.

CURRENT OBJECTIVES :

Scone ARES
Z \
PROJECT LIEMPTY

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL =,
. : ace

A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its tenth
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FJSTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets of opportunity (hrough stationary/mobile photo=
graphic and physical surveillance mechanisms, Corollary
objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY
installations, mechanisms and. personnel are as follow:

1. To provide detailed operational information pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of the FJSTEAL
personnel, particularly those individuals of intelJigence
interest, as well as information on the FJSTEAL physical

Plant and visitors to the premises,

2, To collect operatioval information on persons associated
with FJSTEAL persoune] and on individuals known or suspected
to have connections with the FJSTEAL intelligence services

or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests

of LNFORT.

3. To provide operational support, counter surveillance
and/or other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and
operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be

deemed necessary,

B, The above objectives dre to be fulfilled through continued
maintenance and exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long~
time contract agent, Raymond H, GERENDE. These objectives are
in consonance with operational directives and Headquarters
requirements as received by Station Mexico City. :

C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY
continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfil-
lment of Station and Headquarters’ requests and requirements for
coverage of various targets falling within the above cited frame-
work, During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly
all of the operational photographs and physical surveillance
reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targeted against
the FJSTEAL installdtion and personnel. Specific examples of the
LIEMPTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in
Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS),

CHANGES .

A.
in the previous renewal request, it has not been found neces-

Operational - Since the institution of the changes described

sary or desirable to make further major changes, The following
minor changes in operational technique have been made in an
effort to obtain continued improvement in the finished product:

B,

1, LIEMPTY-9's proven effectiveness as an observer (see
paragraph 3 A (3) below) has enabled us to institute a

system of special coverage on specific FJSTEAL personnel

of interest, or special coverage of specific time periods,

of interest, The purpose is to permit the Station to gain
greater insights into.the activities and personal associations
of certain individuals, or in overall activities during a
certain time period, No ctange in LIEMPTY-9's overall
working hours has been made; rather, flexibility has been

introduced,

2, Flexibility has also been introduced into the handling
of LIENTRAP, which is now vorking more closoly with the
LIEMBRACE team in order to-take greater advantage of targets
of opportunity, To this end, LIEMBRACE~1 has been placed

in direct contact with LIENTRAP, relieving Raymond H. GERENDE
of this responsibility and permitting GERENDE to devote time

to MHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).

3. Ie September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by
the Mexican MHRAVEL committee, This position gave him direct
access to FJSTEAL and other delegations of interest, and

‘supplemented the Station's MHRAVEL program, It is expected

that GERENDE will obtain MHRAVEL employment.again in 1968,

Financial - LIEYPTY-4 and -11 were granted salary increases

effective 1 July 1967. Memoranda of ‘Oral Commitment were for-

warded to Headquarters in HMMA-32584 and HMMA-32585, 20 July
1967. There was no change in the salaries of the remaining

LIEMPTY agents.

Cc.

Personnel = None.

EFFECTIVENESS

Throughout the period under review, each operational component
of Project LIFMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the

‘fulfillment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico

City. High~lights of the accomplishments and the achievements
of each compenent are cited below:

ee



A. ¥ixed Basehouses

1, LIMITED

Throughout the past project year the LIMITED installations
provided daily photographic Coverage and physical surveil-
lance of the main gate of the FJSTEAL installation, In
addition, the LIMITED base Provided for a fixed radio
dispatching station which was used to support the LIEMBRACE
surveillance team, Due to the stringent security measures
instituted in the immediate vicinity of the FJSTEAL instal-
lation by local security forces, normal stake-outs ny this
ufilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio
dispatching support from the LIMITED radio base, which
allows the LIEMBRACE team to work from adjacent safe areas,
secure surveillance coverage of this target can be provided.
During the 12-month period from 1 November 1966 through

31 October 1967, the LIMITED base provided 1,834 frames of
operational photographs, mm addition, the LIMITED base
provided over 2,500 pages of physical surveillance reports,

2, LILYRIC

During the project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance
of the front of the FUSTEAL installation, The LILYRIC base
provided the majority of tke operational photographs produced
by the LIEMPTY project, During the 12-month period cited

in the LIMITED section above, the LILYRIC base provided
12,137 operational photograPhs and several thousand pages

of physical surveillance reports covering the daily move-
ments of all FJSTEAL officers.

3. LICALLA

During the above cited 12-yonth period, the LICALLA instal-
lation provided photograph:¢ and physical surveillance
coverage of the back of the FJSTEAL installation and its
garden and patio area, Th:S coverage provided 4,917 indi-
vidual photographs as well.8S numerous surveillance and
observation reports, It stould be noted that the LICALLA
base allows Station Mexico City to observe the FJSTEAL
personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours,

The LICALLA installation hsS become the most valuable of the
three, not only hecause of its unique vantage point but also
because of the perceptiveness of LIEMPTY-9, His surveil-
lance reports have frequeatly given us valuable insight
into personal associations among the FJSTEAL personnel and
have enabled us to introduce greater flexibility and
effectiveness into the entire LIEMPTY operation,



ome

B. Summary of Fixed Basehouse Effectiveness

The fixed LIEMPTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC)
provided approximately 18,888 individual frames of oper-
ational photographs during the 12-month period of the past
project year; This photographic coverage, linked with the
Physical surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse,
has proven to be a most reliable and viable tool for:

1, Following the daily comings and goings of,
FJSTEAL personnel and indigenous employees,

2, Confirming the identities of FJSTEAL staffers
and their visitors (some of whom are WOLADY citizens},

3. Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and
position as well as indicating the specific intelligence
service connection of various FJSTEAL officers,

4, Providing detailed reporting on the movement and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest,

5. Providing physical facilities for the support of
various operational, technical and surveillance
operavions.

C. The Mobile Photographic Unit

1. » Throughout the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile
photographic support unit was regularly exploited and used
by Station Mexico City, not only on the FJSTEAL target, but
also for PBRUMEN and Commucist Party operations as well as
the JMTIGER program. Over 2,000 operational photographs were
provided, In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit

was used regularly to service and obtain various postal
accomodation boxes used by Mexico City, Headquarters and
other field stations,

D. Raymond H, GERENDES - LIEMPTY Principal Agent

During the period under review, with the exception of short
vacation periods, Raymond H, GERENDE, continued in his role
as the Project LIEMPTY principal agent, GERENDE operated
as the fulj-time cut-out to the LIEMPTY, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling respon-
sibility for the related personnel, In addition, GERENDE

es



continued to bear the contact and handling responsibilities
Of the LIENTRAP unit (until mid-August 1967 - see paragraph
2 A.(2) above) and for the operator of the LIEMPTY photo-
graphic developing/processing laboratory, LIEMPTY-4.
GERENDE's overall operatioral assignment involved at least
12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his
meétings with the LIEWPTY Froject case officer, It should
also be noted that GERENDE made numerous and essential
‘contributions to the sensitive AMROD operation and assisted
the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in
many “instances, .He is frequently used to make independent
investigations and neighborhood checks, As noted above,

he contributed significantly to the Station's MHRAVEL
program, Finally, he apprcached, developed and eventually
attempted to recruit an agent for use in PBRUMEN operations,

E. Overall Effectiveness

As outlined above, each incividual operational component
of the LIEMPTY Project contributed regularly and significantly
to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City's operational
program, Based on the continued excellent performance and
overall contributions of this project, the Station strongly
recommends that this project be continued during the forth~
coming project year as an essential element of the Station's
operational support apparatus,

PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

During the project year under review there were no known inci~
dents which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY
or the related personnel.

LIAISON AND _INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION
Not applicable’to Project LIEMPTY,

PLANS

A. As noted above, the technical and operational changes
made in the past year have been effective and have resulted
in a product which is as closely geared to operational
requirements as possible, While no major changes are
contemplated, every effort will be made to continue to
improve the product, including greater use of GERENDE as
an independent investigative asset, and as a spotter and
assessor of selected agent candidates. Such utilization
of GERENDE will be kept compartmented from other personnel
of the LIEMPTY project and will normally be handled by
GERENDE in operational alias,

A, Past Project Year = Project LIEMPTY was previously approved
for the period 1 December 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the
amount of 45,000 U.S. currency, Station records indicate that
through 31 October 1967, Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 in ...
the field, ‘It-is estimated that a total of 40,130 will be expended
in the entire project year. Bi-weekly accountings witn pertinent
receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H, GERENDE
to the Station finance orficer via the project case officer for all_
LIEMPTY Project expenditures made in the field. It is estimated

that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst
time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative
and analytical requirements of this project. (This figure does not
include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H, GERENDE).

B, During Project Year ~ It is requested that Project LIEMPTY be
approved in the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period 1 ~~
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents a *
slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project
year). While no large expenditures are anticipated for the replace=
ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an
increase in the rental of the various basehouses may be encountered
as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases. Of the
amount requested above, 26,205 dollars should be allowed for fiscal
year 1968 and 17,315 dollars for fiscal year 1969, A detailed break-
down of the project expenditure by category and by fiscal year follows;

8, EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete
enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is
now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained
with the majority of the active LIEMPTY agents via Raymond H,
GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.

B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be
maintained with the majority of the active project agents,
However, under the circumstances described above, it is highly
probable that the activities of this project would be somewhat

curtailed,



—

C. Revised and up-dated emergency contact plans for use with
Raymond H. GERENDE and Olivor G. SCANTLING are on file in the
Station and at Headquarters (see HMMA-28333, dated 21 February

1966 and HMMA-28252, dated 9 February 1966),

CoumenY FOR IMTERWAL STAFF WEE (Net to do lorward to the Division)

COuMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (fo Go Farcard to fhe Divialen)

The CI Staff concurs in the renewal of this very
valuable Project. The Staff strongly urges the Station to
continue its close monitoring of Soviet interest in the
installation buildings and attempts to obtain information on
sensitive project personalities. The Station should devise
necessary contingency plans of action to eliminate any
securfty hazards if it is determined that the Soviets are
intensifying such efforts and could be gatting “too close"to
the Project installations, personalities and activities.

A, The overall objective of Project LIEMFTY, now in its ninth year of ex
istence, is te collect: operational inforwation on tie LDGRICK installation,
its personnel shi visitors, as well as releted targets cf opportunity
through staticnery/aobile photographie and physical sarvetllence mechantsus.
Corollary obJectives which are to be’fulfilled through use of the LIECIY
installations, wechanisas and personnel are aa follow:

1. To provide detatled operational inforastion pertaining to the
daily movesents and activities of the LIQERICK personnel, particularly
those individuals of intelligence interest, as well as inforuation

on the LDGAICK physical plant and visitors to the preaises.

2, To callect operationel inforwation on persons associated with
LIMERICK personnel and on individuals known or suspected to have
connections with the LIMSRICK intellicence services or other hostile
groups vhich are inimical to the interests of LTS.

To previde operational support, counter surveilisnce end/or other
services to WOFACT personnel and operaticns, as aay be
levied uzea the Station or as asy be deened necesssry.

B. The above chjectives are to be fulfilled through continued asintensnce
and itatich of the LINITSD, LILYAIC ana LICAuLA basehouses, the
LIS@RAP gobile unit, and the services of long-time contrect agent,
Raynond M, GSRENDS, These objectives are in consonan

granass,

A. Operationsl - As noted in the ‘previous Request for Project Renewal,
the foraer LINITAD property ves sdld to LIXOUSDE, who as per foranl ecree-
ment with the. Station, desolished the oli structure and constructed a aew
edifice. While it vas initially contesplated to-place the LIMITED ~
(LIMETYs ~b and ~7) personnel in the new building and to retein the same,
equal divigion of vorklosd between LILYRIC sna LIMITED, 1c wa» later’
aeciued to nove the present LILYRIC basehouse personnel (LIFNPTYs-13, -l4,
~26 and -27) into the new base instead, along vith the following ancillary
modifications:

An increase in the hours of both the photosrephic and physical surveillence
coverage provided from the new bace by the LILYRIC operators (c800-1509
hours) during the weekdeys anl to have the LIMITED bace provide
photographic and sical surveillance coverage froa 1600-1630 hours

oa weekdays and from 0990-1300 hours on weekends, ‘These changes were
dictated by the followin; considerations:

1, The new LIMOUSINE building offers a such better vantage point
for both photographie and phyoicrl surveillance than does the
present complex which housen the LILYRIC end LIMITED bases.
‘Therefore, the Station felt that the personnel occupying this
new base should be those possessing the hishest technicel skills
and also those able to provide the eost thorough ani coaplete
coverase, Since the LIMITS) base now has only one trained
operator while the LILYRIC basehouse hes thvee, the LILYRIC grouy
and a revision of working houra wes indicatel.

2, Because Lt was epparent that the coverage of the LIMERICK
Lastallation would be a long-range aud continuing requiresent,
the Station desired to steff the new bese with personnel of long=
range potential, LIZMPTY-6, now alacst EC years clt, does not
possess this potentiel; hovever, the LILYRIC ageat coxplex
happily coabines experience! personnel with youthful agents.

3. Finally, the social and financisl status of the LILIc
personnel ts auch sore compatible end consistent with the en-
virongent of the nev building than is that of the LIMITED fsetly.

“1, The LIEMPTY Project Renewal request forwarded in
reference, was approved on 29 January 1965 for the period
1 December. 1964 through 30 November 1965 for a total of
$45,300; $27,675 for FY 1965 and $17,625 for FY 1966.

2, At the time of approval, ‘Assistant KUDOVE stated
he expects this project to live within the sum outhorized
for the year, and that there will be no amendment for
additional funds.

* 3, As you were informed in HMMW 13282 in the dispatch
on the LIEMBRACE Project Renewal, KUTUBE is interested in
the problem of hostile monitoring of any radio communications
from LIMITED, You should remain ‘alert to this problem, and
inform us if Headquarters can be of any assistance in helping
you maintain communications security.

4, You are reminded that the LIEMPTY Project, as approved,
only covers the salary for Oliver G. SCANTLING through 31 May
1963, It is suggested that o separate project be written to
cover SCANTLING if his new duties do not fall entirely under

any other approved project.

Renewal of this project is recommended. This
operation continues to carry out the same type of
activity it hae engaged in for a number of years
and its product continues to be important to our
efforts against the Soviets and Communist Party in
Mexico, The Station should carefully select the
new operational assignment of Oliver G. ECANTLING
so as to make best use of this long-time asset's
considerable clandestine experience.

Review of Project LIEMPTY

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

5 CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A, Oliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed {n relation to project
objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and phystcal facilities," SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA-14093,

13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide
worthwhile information pertaining to thls objective,

a, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example,
operational information recently indicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the services of a Mcxico Clty firm to repair
safes, Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to;
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner In the |
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this information in another manner, !

2 b, SCANTLING is still the Station’s primary source S for
keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK
personnel in Mexico City, This ls accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
leads which Indicate the LIMERICK people are interested in '
renting a given piece of property. (See previous project renewal
request for additional detatls), :
2, "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets
of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING is very useful for collecting
information on other Station targets:

-2-

a, On the basis of a request to the Station from the
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an
eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired antt-CASTRO
demonstrations, Not only did SCANTLING obtain the desired
information, and samples of many‘of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs,, 5 June 1961.
SCANTLING does an excellent Job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively,

bd, SCANTLING was instrumental tn establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage Interest to Headquarters,

c. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and associates,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,
and surveillances." SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below:

a, SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy, SCANTLING
talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was
primarily responsible for the later success of the recruicment
made by another Station agent,

b, Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City, See
the last renewal for additional details on this case,

©. In connection with the above objective SCANTI.ING
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood Investigations
for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local \
investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE
components,

SECRET/RESBX


SECRET /BK
-3-

d, SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
training to LIPAILS S and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this ts not a direct contribution to the above objective, it
is constdered sufficlently related to mention here,

{ 4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,

, SCANTLING ts used for miscellancous support requirements from the

| Station, For example, SCANTLING Is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and

will continue to do so untll the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962, Also,
dueing the past project year, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance

, team until July 1961 when Simon D, CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico
Clty. SCANTLING Is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments
for other Station operations,

5, As stated In the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, It. ts the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activitles in general, SCANTLING's production, measured
against monetury expenditures, case officer time and other Intangible factors,
unquest tonably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project

LIEMPTY.

B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relatlon to project
objectives);

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilittes through use of photographic base houses,"
‘Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective, To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how they contribute
to the above objective, “There has heen no change In the coverage as
described in the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational

leads pertalning to Station targets cf opportunity." The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is scill the major contributor to this

SECRET


+ SECRET SeK
-4-

objective. In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station ‘operations, LIENTRAP devoted neariy four
months, on a fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation, For
several weeks the entire “take” from the LIERODE target was recorded
from the LIENTRAP vehicle, Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the initial LIERODE stationary base.

3. “To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e. ,
rent hotel rooms.and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities, GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

4, The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued,

C, Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As scated in the previous project renewal, tt can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive, The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has tt been intended that it should do so, The project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
{nformation in support of other Station operations,

Th CHANGES .

There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project
year except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)

surveillance team in July 1961 in accordance with previous plans,

SECRET/Ka3



SECRET/355Se
-5-

W, ° EFFECTIVENESS

There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made in Section III of last year's project renewal request, ~

Ww PROBLEMS

The securtty problem in connection with the LICALLA.operation, which
was described in last year's renewal request, ts stlll present but has not caused
any known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29. May..1961, The base operator has been cautioned to be
ever alert for any unusual .inctdents which might indicate that the base has been
compromised. This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project
during the past project year,

v. PLANS

The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year, Rather, efforts will be
devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational
arrangements,

vl. COSTS

A, Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended $21, 458.00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00, It is anticipated that about $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project.year. This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500.00, or some $12, 500.00 :
under the budget estimate of $53,000.00.

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $49,500.00 budget, itemized below,
$29, 500.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the

. balance, $20,000.00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accounting
procedures will be used for all expenditures,

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIGMPTY
(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

CURSENT CRJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

Qliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation
to project objectives):

1, "fo collect operational information per
taining to LINERICK personnel and physical
facilities.” SCANTLING has continued (See the
last Project Review forwarded as an attachment
to HTA-14093, 13 November 1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per=-
taining to the above objective. There follow
e@ few exanples of SCANTLING's production:

@ A detailed casing of the LIMERICK
electrical power supply was forwarded

to Headquarters as an attachnent to
HrOtt-14496, 12 February 1960. The pro=
duction of this type of operational
information, which takes several weeks
to compile accurately, illustrates the
unusual talents possessed by SCANTLING
together with his valuable contributions
to the Station's operational information
collection effort.

b. SCANTLING has been used frequently
to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/
LINSRICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFSAT indicated

that the LIMERICK target was having con~
siderable contact with an AG3NCIA ROBLES
concerning the handling of incoming and
outgoing shipments. By discreet investi~
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
Station with additional pertinent information
about the address, owner and type of business
engaged in by the firm, Such information f
then becomes readily available for exploitation
should a LIMERICK shipment of oarticular
interest come to the attention of the Station.

e. SCANTLING is the Station's primary
investigative asset for keeping track of
current residence addreseees of LIMERICK
persornel, The Station considers it important
from the counterespionage standpoint to main-
Vain invormaticon on the lecavion of all

as cor



: a g ary joanna’
Se cae | / bhacd Wed

A
Le

ode

LIMERICK residences. In addition, specific
targeto are continually considered for LICOOL
installations, A recent example of SCALTLING's

efforts in this connection wuld be the spot-
ting and acquisition of the LIMOTCR base in
the same apartment building with LITALOK @l.
Contributions of this type operational informa=
‘tion are quite time consuming due to the
necessity for checking cut several apartments
that a LIMERICK individual may initially be
considering as a residence.

2, "To collect cperational information pertaining to
other targets of opportunity, foreign official installe~
tions and personnel of intelligence interest operating
in Mexico." Aa indicated below, SCANTLING is also
extremely useful for collecting information on lee

other than LIMERICK:

@. In March 1960 SCANTLING was instrumental

in locating property adjecent to the LITABBY
installation which the Stetion hae since

rented in anticipation of initiating photo~
grephic and technical operations. SCANTLING ~
was able to accomplish this assignment only
after a thorough casing and pretext investi-
gations of the several pieces of property
appropriate for such operations,

be SCAITLING is also used to follow up
sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT
and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and
sister + gets (See exemple as to type
under I,A,1, b and ¢ above).

SCANTLING waa used ec an investigative

Ce uscd

asset to determine the local address Pend
exact employment of Gordon William CROVES
(201~220025), a counterespionage case of
interert to Headquarters and ODENVY.

3. “To exploit operational leads through recruitments
debriefings, and surveillances.” As exanples of
SCANTLING's contribution to this objective, the
following cases are listed:

a. SCANTLING devoted a considerable amount
of time to his attempts to locate Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez, a known agent of a Com
munist Country. He followed various leads
on GONZALEZ from March to Augugt 1966 btefore



-}e
{

GONCALES was finally identified ord his
Mexico City home aid business addressee were |
ascertained. See ENMA-15626, 9 September 1960, fi

for further details on this cases

de. The preliminary investigative work on a
KUSCDA cace of priority interest was conducted
by SCANTLING, During this investigation it

was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to
Aquascalientes, Guanajuato md Minatitlan to
obtain the information required by Headquarters.
See the attachments to WivT-1416, 20 May 1960,
for the results of the investigation.

4 In addition to hia contributions to the above objec=
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station. For exarple, SCAKTLING
hardled several of Raymond H, GERLIPE's (ps) operations
while the latter was away from Mexico City during Auguat
and Septenber 1960, Also, SCANTLING has been managing
the LIJERSEY surveillance team since the departure of
Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960, It is hoped that
SCANTLING can be relieved of thie assignment as soon

as the LITEMPO project is approved. SCANTLING hae aleo
been used to spot and rent safe houses for various
Station operations, a valuable operational support

services

5s As stated in the preceeding Request for Project
Renewal, al though SCANTLING's L TY Project objectives
can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinion that SCANTLING has made inportant and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically
and to other Station activities in gener. SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures,

ease officer time and other intangible factors, ungjues~
ticnably justifies his continuation as m integral part

of Froject LISNPLY.
Raymond H. GEREXDE Segment (discussed in relation to project

objectives):

1. "To collect operational information pertaining ‘to
LIMERICK personnel and physical fecilities through ‘use
of photographic base houses." Together with their
extensive photographic coverace of the LIMERICK target,
the photographic bases also contrivute other types. of
operational information:

® LIMITED ~ This base cocpiles daily logs :
indicating all arrivals, demrtures and, 3 7
where possible, identities of every person
visiting or working at the LI¥ CK targete

i



“This information ts particularly useful in keeping track of

“SECRET MSGR

LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of
visitors to the installation, Also, LIMITED maintains a
summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily
basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day,

. Finally, one other significant service ts performed by this

base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity,
LIMITED's photographic coverage ts still concentrated on
visltors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation, A recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit
the LIMERICK target on a certain day, The base was alerted
to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any
person appearing to be an American, The results of this
assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables, LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-
quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity,

b, LILYRIC - This base's ourput of high-quality clandestine
photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year,
In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares Abeiaed
reports on LIMERICK empioyees and their wives, 1.
dlov performs the assignment of noting and reporting
license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the’
LIMERICK installation, LILYRIC photograplis also are con-
centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees,
It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic
coverage during the hours from daylight to 1400 hours each
day of the week except Sunday, The LIMITED base maintains
photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day
except Sunday,

c, LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the
LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational
information through photographic coverage of LIMSRICK
employees and their families, Also, the base operator,

SECRET sexe


SECRET/Saggg>

-5-

LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information
pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target
employees, -He accomplishes this objective by careful
observation and analysis, LICALLA also maintains a daily
attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA
coverage of the target, both photographic and phystcal
observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK
personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-

espionage effort,

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LLENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, {s the major contributor to this objective, It
has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
pretext Investigetions in support of numerous Station activities, The
cases listed below are cited as examples:

a, nthe case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3,a, above)
LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his
Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters
provided. photographs, lett no doubt that GONZALEZ was the
subject of interest to Headquarters,

b, LIENTRAP confirmed the Identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
investigation of the residents of an apart ment building where
CASTILLO was believed to live, Later, LIENTRAP supported the
results of the Investigation with excellent photographs of the
subject, ”

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, t.e., rent
hotel rooras and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for
other Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive
area knowledge and personal operattonal capabilitles combine to make
him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities,
GERENDE also procures post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them,

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time
expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project ls worthwhile and
should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational
information produced,

Simon D, CLACKETT Segment (discussed In relatton'to project
objectives):

l, "To collect operational tnfotmatton and to identify operational leads
pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets.of opportunity,"
During this project year the LYERSEY survelllance team under the
direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support
efforts through pretext Investigatlons and physical survetllances, Some
examples of the team's work are listed below:

a, Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) is a Guatemalan
Communist which the team had under surveillance from
November 1959 to April 1960. The survelllance, together

with Information acquired from other sources, eventually

CHANGES

A. Simon D, CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LUERSEY surveillance
team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year. As explained In the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIERSEY tcam on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would

permit the Station wv cuniliue io profit from CLACKETT's past efforts,

B, Oliver G, SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT’s departure, SCANTLING has been handling the
LYERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of
the LITEMPO project, SCANTLING has been exposed to, and Nkewise
knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20, SCANTLING is

known to L-2G only by an allas,

Station's needs - The Station ts of the opinion that its operarioas are only
as good as the support mechantsms backstopping and contributing to them,
''The availability of unilateral support agents and organizations, such as
‘the LIEMPTY Project, to tnvestigate leads and to collect operational
information is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counterespionage objectives. ‘The Station would be seriously handicapped
in tts operarional activities should the support services of such agents as
GERENDE, SCANTLING and the agents under their control be suddenly

“Cl . ‘Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent -
assets to perform Investigations, photographic assignments and other
essential types of. Support Services in connection with Station targets of
opportunity represent an operational advantage which-thts Station considers

D. ‘Although the progress and Success of any support project depends
upon requirements-from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project

year,
PROBLEMS

A, Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in .
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA is located in one
of these units) and the Station considered {t appropriate to. suspend photo-
graphic operations:pending resolution of the situation, At this time,
there Is no indication when’LICALLA operations will be resumed, . The
LICALLA base operator has reported that. there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspictous actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has’ been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, such a
possibility will exist unt the release of the three techniclans, No
other security problems have occurred during the past year,

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs-- During the past year considerable
progress has been maile in the Station's handling, i.e., sorting, Indexing,
identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases.

B. . Photo; graphic Techniques - Thé previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal
Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using

from HY-PAN negatives were too gralny and, consequently, were of
little use. in producing good identified shots of Individuals, In view
of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted,
It should be noted thar Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which
all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously
used by the Starion for clandestine photography, The quality ofall -
base phorographs have been increased. hasan as a direct résult
of this new film,

C, General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his Interim
responsibility for the LYERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casing activities, The transfer of the LJERSEY team
to Project LITTEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an
appreciable amount. It ts not planned, during the coming year, to
expand present LIEMPTY activities,

COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records Indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120. 91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (L December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734,69, Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50, 000,00, An additional
$4, 000.00 will be obliyated during the 12th month of the project year,
This will bring total project expenditures to about $54,000.00 for the
entire project year,

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $53, 000,00 budget, itemized below,
$31, 900.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year
1961 and the balance, $22,100.00, should be expended during Fiscal
Year 1962, Normal accounting procedures will be used for all
expenditures,

As regards the requiremeu listed in CSI-F No, 230-60, Annex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions,"
the Station does not anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives, However, both principal

| agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile
sources of information to mainrain contact with under any adverse
conditions, Both of these agents identify themselfs, in terms of
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as
Mexican nationals (which they are). It is reasonable to assume, there-
fore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would become valuable contacts
in any emergency situation,

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY

(for the Purp of Project Renewal)

i PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives):

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK.
personnel and physical facilities," During the past year SCANTLING has devoted
a significant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although
other Station operations and personnel-are also concerned with vie collection of
operational information abowt LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions
are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources.
‘example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the ‘source of information about LIMERICK
physical facilities, He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, con
struction activities and the kinds of outside services utilized by the LIMERICK
installation, He regularly visite Inez PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property
adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior
grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Senora de Moreno about any unusual activities
which she may have-observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a
thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all

other residences and establishments in the same block. This operational information
is intended for KURIOT's use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical
meters for measuring the amount of electrical power used and the precise points
where wires enter each property. Because of his other sensitive activities and
because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING

has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might
conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station, During the time he spent
training Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) in radio controlled mobile surveillance,
SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work af the LIMERICK installation;
however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLACKETT on dispatching tech~
niques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance

team using two-way radios,

For

2. “Yo collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest
operating in Mexico." By far the most important contribution made by SCAN'‘TLING
in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT
operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a
pretext cover story. During this visit SCANTLING managed to collect highly
valuable operational information about the security of the installation, which has
added materially to KUBARK's knowledge about the-terget. SCANTLING has also
cased and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting

SECRE T/gtPQp


™~

a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type
activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station
targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported
in separate correspondence.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings
and surveillances," This objective was included in the LIEMPTY project because
SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LIEMPTY
photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of
leads obtained from the above sources, The information resulting from these in-
vestigations has enabled the Station to maintain current data on the various firms
used by the LIMERICK target and in one instance, Octavio VIDALES (201- )»
caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical
penetration of the LIMERICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the
Station anticipates that SCAN'TLING will some day be successful in just this type of
activity. SCANTLING is the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/
LIMERICK and LIEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the

primary target,

4," Not covered by a specific project objective but, néverthele:
Significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributions to the overall
Station support efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT,
SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for
use by the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. He devised a superior method for
numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location
without reference to street names and areas. The entire radio dispatch code, when
used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine
surveillance team. From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted
an investigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 yeare old and
reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision
to terminate LIVESTOCK-2, SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting
hote! rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supporting operations such as
LICOOL-12 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible
cutout between the Station and agents from other geographical areas.

5. Although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING'has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station
activities in general. SCANTLING's production, méasured against monetary.
expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies
his continuation as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

“4.1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through the use of photographic base hou
_ This continuing objective is carried out by three photographic base houses,
ne : LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA. During the project year, LIMITED produced
. approximately 3600 photographs and LILYRIC about 4500 pictures of individuals
es + entering and leaving the LIMERICK target. Most of these photographs were of
7 non-LIMERICK individuals of which only a small, but significant, percentage
£ ““- could be identified through license plate checks or other types of routine investi-
gation. The LICALLA base produced approximately 4300 photographs during the year.
Most of the LICALLA photographs were of LIMERICK employees and their families
and have been of considerable value in-maintaining current and accurate listings
of LIMFRICK personnel in Mexico. Tho LICALLA base has recently begun taking
-motion pictures of LIMERICK personnel conversing in the garden area. These
movies are being forwarded to KUTUBE/D for the possible exploitation of lip
reading analysis. ‘The LIMITED base, in addition to its photographic assignment,
is also used as the radio central for dispatching the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel targets. All bases make routine reports on the daily
attendance of LIMERICK employeen at the installation which facilitates the Station's
reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel, Also, the bases
devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK
employees, Some ofthis latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of
confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associate with

their colleagues,

2, “To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targeta of opportunity." This is a broad objective
and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation, LIENTRAP is used
to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justify
a more permanent photographic base. During the period under réview, LIENTRAP
has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group
activities, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)
headquarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY
targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest, The operational

- information produced by LIENTRAP is used by the Station for increasing

operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated
in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets,

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent
hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances.""§ GERENDE,
because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, iv used frequently by the
Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictitious names for use on other
Station operations. He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office
boxes for use as letter drops. This objective pertains entirely to the operational
support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security
of importait Station activities.

4. The production of operational information as represented by
LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP is an important adjunct to the
Station's coverage of the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.
It is the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARK assets, i.e,, money
and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued,

G. Simon D, GLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1, “To collect operational information and to identify operational
leads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity." Very
little production has been realized from this objective in terms of CLACKETT's
contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving
surveillance, tradecraft and photography training in Headquarters, He then spent the
rest of April, May and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobile sur-
veillance techniques. Then LIEMPTYe 15, 16, 17 and 20 were placed under his
supervision and he began training these agents in the arts of foot surveillance and
mobile surveillance. This team, known’as the LISERSEY team, is just beginning to
show the excellent effects of GLACKETT's intensive training sessions. Although
LIEMPTY-17 has resigned and the team consists of only four agents, including
CTLACKETT, the Station believes that the team will be ready within the next month
to begin its contributions to the above objective.

2, Based on the training time devoted to CLAGKETT and to the LUERSEY
team and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's
opinion that this activity should be continued.

Ww EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN.
FURTHERED.

Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of
Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance
of the Related Mission Directive, The project is not intended nor designed to
produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station operations,

i. PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

aA. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:

1, SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same
now as they were when the original LIEMPTY project outline was submitted. Since
SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LIEMPTY, progress, other than
covered in the above section on production, can be measured only by the fact that
SCANTLING is a year older and has acquired a few more helpfal tricks of the trade

SECRE TSR



mr

SECRE T/ttgzeaaR
-5-
and, consequently, has increased his own operational abilities.

2, Insofar as future planning is concerned, SCANTLING will
continue to devote the greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In
addition, he will continue his work against the LIMERICK target, i.e., investi~
gating LIFEAT and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives
of the LIEMPTY and LIMESA projects. The Station still plans to maintain
SCANTLING as an independent Station asset free from the responsibilities of super
vising other agente and operations,

3. SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative
support to LIEMPTY-3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be
responsible for the operational direction of L-3.

B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment:

1, During the past year the three photographic base houses have
been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of
photographs on dark cloudy days, One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently
begun making 35mm color slides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This
film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not
possible. It is the Station's opinion that a few color photographs of target personnel
will be useful for identification purposes. The LICALLA Base has also, during the
past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that
Headquarters can eventually provide lip reading analysis of conversations taking
place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation, :

2, Other operational progress has been made in connection with
relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team, This
mow leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic
base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory. :

3. Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for
expansion, Rather,. the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures
now in use and to experiment with night photography possibilities using the fast
HY-PAN film with telephoto lens of varying lengths. GERENDE will also concentrate
on increasing the security and communications procedures used with each base.

C. Simon D, CLACKETT Segment:

1, GLACKETT's assumption of responsibility for the LISERSEY
» surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional +
and much needed support ascet. Although the LIJERSEY team has been in existence

for several years, 1t was only during the past year, with the assignment of

SECRET/ aR

- | CLACKETT, that an intensive effort was made to train the team members and to

'; place them under the. supervision of a full time team leader. As mentioned above,
CLACKETT has done'an excellent job during the past few months in getting the
team ready for future operational assignments,

2. The Station plans, during the coming year, to increase the
_atrength of the LLIERSEY team by at least two agents and one car, This would
then give a total LISERSEY complement of six agents and three radio cars, The
Station will continue to take all necessary precautions not to rush the development
of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult.
It ia anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next
month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party pene-

tration program,
IV. PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION,

f fk!

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained
and motivated agent, SCANTLING's production during the period under review was
excellent, His production ie in the category of operational information rather than
positive intelligence and is based on leads and investigations given him by the
Station, He never fails to do a thorough and detailed Job on all assignments

given to him, He is an unusually valuablegffinéipal agent.> There have been no
security problems or developments during the past year in connection with
SCANTLING's assignments, Likewise, his cover is very good and places him

in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE - Since GERENDE's marriage in December
1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree, He has become one
of the Station's most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings,
completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task,
regardless of how menial it may be. Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know,
his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well, In fact, GERENDE
recently was able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very
large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE's firm. This,
of course, endears GERENDE to LISTERINE in addition to contributing to
GERENDE's cover employment. The only significant security incident pertaining,
in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LIENTRAP (please see HMMA-13951,

16 October 1959, for details).

cC Simon D. CLACKETT - CLACKETT's performance has definitely
measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he
is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine
He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance as

V.  GONTAGT AND COMMUNICATION,
: A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING
on the average of three times each week, For regular mectings, a total of eight
Prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING "walking the beat"
and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter's car, This procedure enables
both the agent and the cage officer to check themselves and to check each other for
possible surveillance, Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than
30 minutes, and are held in the car. It is possible for SCANTLING to get in touch
with his case officer by telephone, and vice versa, in case an unscheduled meeting

is necessary. SCANTLING and the Station aré currently working on the details of

an emergency means of contact utilizing SCANTLING's wife's relatives in PBPRIME.
Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements to facilitate contact with
SCANTLING in the event Mexico is overrun by hostile forces and contact with the

Station is severed,

B. Raymond H, GERENDE - GERENDE's Case Officer meets with him five

1, Reference is nade to your cosmonts on the LIE-TTY Project vhich vas
approved on 1¢ January 195%

2. Tho LIENFTY Project provides for the development of tho forrer
LIJERS*Y survolllence tenn, tho maintenance of photo surveillance bases, and
other support facilities fer the Mexico City station, In their reviow of the
Projoct before it vas ap:roved, FI/OPS sugmested that Wi! Division consider @
gradval reduction of th considerable financial and porsonnal commitments in
thio projoet in view of the favorably devoloring LYE-VOY Matacn relationship,
FI/OPS believed that a omaller, nore manageable support group vith greater
omphasia on pelectivity of tasko ani targets could well result in nore effective

GI and FI productivity.

3. Tho Mextean desk wishos to point ont that rather than redueing the
ageets carried unter the LIEYPTY Project, VHD believes that this project 1s
an extronoly important ono and should receive Headuarters support. Tho only
other Station surveillu.ce teams, LIVESTOCK and LTEPRACE, are both knoun
to the Mexican cuthorities, Therefore LI‘‘FTY remains the Station's only
secure gurveillecce agset. It is a very snal] untrained unit at present, but
through this project it will he developid into a useable, valuable assote

40 We are not passing FI/OP's comment to the Meld, because WH Diviata:
bolieves that unilateral assots ohould not 'e reduced in favor of Maison.
Firat, the IMaison has n-t yot been firmly established. secondly, even with a
good Maison relationship, the Mexican ssrvices must be considered anything but
seoure, and certainly could not be trusted with any sensitive operations.
Thirdly, because of its proximity to the United States, and the ectivity of
hostile intelligence groups thers, the Mexito City Station 4s called upon to
support many vory nensitive operations vhich ve vould never wish to reveal to
the Mexican authoritios.

5. Experience in other latin



- recomend that the México Station reduce any of it's unilateral support assets

f page 2

5. Experience in other Latin Aneriean countries vhere Maison has bean
established, !:aa shown that many Station's tend to redues their unilateral
operations and capabilities in favor of tho Matson. Under these cirounstances,
the production of the Stationa heve often been at the mercy of the Matson :
service and a change in the attitule of the service tovard cooperating vith i

3, among the Staffs' comments on the LISIMY Troject, the following
recomendations were made. KUDSLX suggested that the Case Officer should
work at devising ostensible sources of incomes for the agents whieh will
stand the scrutiny of friends, relatives and less friendly forces.

kk. an axendnent to CLACKSTi's contract has been requested to allow
for a cuarters allowance. The educrtional allowance requested in parngrash
UO of the project anendnent was disapcroved because CLACKRTT was 8 Contract
Agent, The Quarters Allowance of £2,590 was turned down because 1% was too
high in relation to CLAC&STI'a salary. Therefore, a quarters allevcuce of
42,800 has been arproved and will be written into CLAUXSTi"e contract. If,
however, operational and cover reasons roquire CLACKET: to rent an apartment

PART I
1.. “Area_of Operations

fhe general area of operations will be Mexico and the epecific area will be
Mexico, D.P., Mexico.

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a mechaniom for the development of
operational information in support of other Station operations. This purpose 16
in conéonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

3. Background

As the reviewing authorities vill be aware, this project includes several
operations which vere formerly carried under Projects LIP@TICK and LIJERSEY.
Partially as a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK compromise, when three surveillance

team membera were apprehended and placedin custody by the Mexican Police, and
additionally as a means for the orderly administration of assets, thie new project

is submitted.
‘There follows below a background aketch of the separate support assets, excluding

-Getails concerning personnel which will be discussed later in the outline, which the

Station proposes for inclusion in LIEMPIY:

= Tho LIMITED Base 1s located in such a position across the street
from oe nice installation that photographs can easily be made of persons enter-
ing and leaving the LIMERICK main gate. ‘These photographs are later developed and
printed by LIEMPTY-4, then returned to the LIMITED operator for the proper annotations.
After receipt’ of the photographs by the Station, the Case Officer revievs then for
LIMESA leads, nevly arrived LIMERICK personnel, local and other nationals of possible
operational interest and PBPRIME citizens vho have visited LIMERICK.

KUBARK owns the property housing the LIMITED Base, having purchased it in mid~
1955; however, the ostensible owner is LIMOUSINE, to whom LIEMPTY-6 pays hia reat
each month through LIMOUSINE's bank.

LIMITED, vith LIEMPTY-6 as base house operator, has been operating Sr nearly
soaps 8 and has not yet been involved in a compromiaing security situation. Prior
to April 1955, when Headquarters authorized the purchase of the LIMITED Base, the
Stution rented the Bage and used LIPSTICK-7 (later LIMESTONE-6 in LIFEAT Project
‘and now terminated) as the operator. This arrangement was in effect for about two

years.

<_garrying Perle to and from ‘the LENSRICK installation, and prepare an observatica
@tery ‘on: ali: t personnel seen each day. (This peraits the Station to tell when
a target | ity 1s cut of town or not working for ecme other reason.)

The LILYRIC Base-was originally acquired and made operative to provide for
Continuous’ ¢average ofthe target in the event LIMITED is ever compromised. This
“ig still the primary value of having tvo bases cover the same portion of the target.
LILYRIC in compartmented fron LIMITSD and with the possible exception of GEHENDE
sould probably weather any security flap involving LIMITRD. Obviously, there ia
“soue duplication in the work of LIMITED and LILYRIC; hovever, the insurance value
of having tvo basis ig quite apparent. -

LILYRIC has been operating for about two and one-half years and insofar as
the Station knows, no compromising security situations have arisen.

LICALLA ~ The LICALLA Base is located in a position vhere photogrephs can be
taken of people within the LIMERICK garden area. In addition, the operator of the
LICALLA Base gubmits weekly reporte On LIMERICK construction work, daily logs show-
ing when 4 target individual was seen that day, and reports showing the association
of target_individuals with one another. LICALLA photographs are processed and handled
in the same manner .and by the people who handle the LIMITED and LILYRIC pictures.

: ‘The LICALLA Base was acquired and operations besan about tvo and one-half
yeare ago with the primary purpose of obtaining additional operational information
concerning LIMERICK personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for
the physical penetration of the LIMSRICK installation. Approximately one year ago
the LICALLA, Base was purchased by KUBARK through LIMOUSINE. LICALLA will probably
remain at ita present location and will continue to subait photographs and reports
of the same type as are nov being submitted. Other than the fact that LIEMPTY-9,
the LICALLA operator, is the brother of former LIPSTICK-47, no security problems are
currently known to the Case Officer. However, reports from LIPSTICK2 12 and 30, the
local police, the attorneys involved in the case, the foreign embassy concerned and
the LCFLUTTER tests give no indications that LIEMPTY-9 was ever mentioned during

the LIPSTICK flap.

LEEWIRAP - This ts a panel type truck equipped vith cameras, telescopic
lens and other types of photographic equipment. It has been used during the past
two years as an investigative asset. The truck is parked about 75 yards fron a
target of interest (ususily a residence or apartment building) and the photographer
in the rear of the truck photographs individuals or things of interest to the Station.
LIENTRAP is a valuable asset for'any station to have and has enabled this Station to
get pictures of individuals which could have been obtained in no other way. LIEMPIYs-

Outline. -

: rages - 7 This is presently an approved project; however, 1t is believed
advisable for administrative efficiency to include the LIJERSEY assets within the
framework of the LIEMPIY Project. Other than LILYRIC, vhich has already been
@iscugsed, LIJERSEY consists of a foot surveillance team with three members, LIEMPTYs-
15,16 and 17. LIEMPIYs 15 end ‘46 have been employed for about oue anda half years
and LIEMPTY-17_ for“ about one year, They bave not developed into as competent a surveil-
lance team as the LIPSRICK téam was and probably never will become as good. The

and observations of
people of interest. LIEMPTY-17, hovever, has also been used as a pretext investigator.
He bas excelled at this type’ of work and the Station continues to use him in this
capacity. The, Station has been reluctant to use the LIJERSEY team as much ag it
could have been used because of the closé association of the team with GERENDE i,
in turn, GERENDE’s knowledge ahd work on LIFZAT and the LIPSTICK surveillance team.
The Station plans to recruit several agents of a type and social level more suitable
for all types of surveillance vork than’ tte present LIJERSEY team.

Oliver G. ACANTLING - SCANTLING has been astociated vith KUBARK for several
years 1n a number of different capacities. He vas originally used as a manber of
the LIPSTICK gurvedliance team and later vas head of the same team. He has been
used to train nev agents in the techniques of surveillance and investigation, to
acquire office space and apartments for the Station's operations and to conduct
Anvestigations and make recrultuent spproaches to individuals of operational interest
to KUBARK. SCANTLING is currently being used by the Station as an investigator of
LIMESA leads andis atill actively pursuing the LIMESA/MKLIGETING operation.

STANTLING also maintains regular contact with LIRAPTY-3 and uonitora his elicitation
effort egainst the LICOOL-6 target. ‘In thia connection, both SCANTLING end LIEMPTY-3
meet regularly with Doris M. KILLGO for operational guidance. (Note: Please see

the LICOOL Fietd Project Outline for additional details on LICOUL-6)..

6. Targete:

Oliver G. SCANTLING - The primary target 12, of course, the LIMERICK installation
end personnel. However, SCANTLING devotes most of his time to following up LIFEAT
leads which pertain.to services provided the LIMERICK installation by individuals
and firms, ¢.g. constructionmgineers, Ticar:
makers, interior decorators, etc.. To an éxtent, |
opportunity aha it would be impossible to list spécifically what future targets
will be available. One specifi¢ target which SCANTLING ia concerned with is the
oceupalit of the LICOOL-6 apartuent; however, LIEMPTY-3, vhom SCANTLING handles,
should more correctly be given credit for information produced on this target.

Raymond H. GERENDS - LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA all have es their target
the LIMERICK installation and personnel, plus sny local nationals and PBPRIMERS
who visit LIMERICK, LIEWIRAP is concerned with targets of opportunity and follow~
up iavestigations on operational leeds obtained from other Station and Headquarters
sources. ‘The same targets apply to the LIJERSEY surveillance team as apply to
LORPIRAP.

RUBARK. GcRENDE ostensibly is a salesman for LISTERINS's firm. Eovever,

seldem spends ary time pursuing hie cover occupation, since his operational
activities are so numerous and time conmsiing. GEREKDE's cover with the LISTERINE

firm was arranged by the Station and, so far, has been adequate for GERERDS's needs.

elie .

Quinton N.-OUSLER, is known only to GERENDE and
SCANTLING. It would not"be possible to develop a suitable cover story that
youl apply to the frequent meetings between the Case Officer and the Principal

: Agents; therefore, meetings are clandestine and are wually conducted in the

a . Case Officer's.car; However, ‘suitable cover stories have been developed between the
Case Officer and SCANILING and between the Case Officer and GERENDE involving back-
_ §Fouid information as to how ve et and how our friendship developed, to be used
in the event ‘tie.Cose Officer ie spprenended with either of the Principal Agents.

“@. Mone of the status cover occupations of any of the LIEMPTY agents id
completely compatible with his operational activities. Action cover stories are
aie deaided upon before cach assignment and devised to complement each agent's status Ba
cover as closely a possible. Bese House operators, of course, generally conduct
operational assiguients within the confines of their quarters; consequently, the
need for action cover stories is reduced. Appropriate cover stories exist between
GERENDE and the agents in his network and between SCANTLING and LIEMPIY-3.

li. Contact and Commmication:

Appropriate clandestine coummications arrangenents exist between the various
echelons of LIEMPTY. At the present time these plans consist of regular and
repid-non scheduled (emergency) means of contact. GERENDE and SCANTLING are both
in the process of preparing detailed written communications plans for their
respective agents which include complete regular, alternate and repid-non
schetuled meeting arrangenents. Provistdas will slso be made in these plans for
oral recognition signals and physical bona fides that will enable a person unknown
.to the agent to contact him should the need ever arise. The Case Officer 1a cur-
rently working on a Warning System of Communications which will permit the ex=
peditious exfiltration of GEREWDE and SCANTLING fran Mexico should a security
situation arise which would necessitate this,

12. Control and Motivation:

@. Control - All LIEMPTY agents are local naticnals, GERENDE and SCANTLING,
doth of whom spent a great deal of their childhood years in PAPRIME and still
have relatives living in FRPRIME, are in many respects more pro-FBPRIME than

many PBPRIME citizens. In the’past, both GERENDE and SCANTLING have evidenced
a a high degree of loyalty to Matthew 3; DIVGLEY, their former Station Case Officer,
and appear to be devoting that sane loyalty to the present Case Officer. The
control over GERENDE and SCANTLING stens directly from their pro-PBPRIME beliefs
end their personal loyalty to their past and present Case Officers. The control
over other LIEMPTY agents ia based in part on pre-PBPRIME attitudes and on the
financial remuneration and good handling they received from GRRENDE and SCANTLING.
Realistically, control over LIEMPIY agents is based on mutual understandings and
confidence among individuals and should any agent decide to denounce PRPRIME or
RUBARK, aa the case may be, there is not much that the Station could do.

b. Motivation - With the exception of GERENDE end SCANTLING, whose primary

motivations are ideological, financial compensation seems to be the basi
motivational factor surrounding LIEMPTY agents. .
