(MISCELLANEOUS) On 17 June 1970, Hanuel SO AGUILAR vas interviewed at
the Miami Pield Office, Region III, 111th MI Group, Miami, Florida, regarding
informeton HE volunteered concerning en anti-Castro Cuban exile group called
Frente Revolucionaria Anti-Cemaunista en Cuba (FRACC) (Anti-Communist Revolu-
tionary Front in Cuba), of which Hé claiaed to be a leader. AGUILAR, 2 jeveler
employed by Kappy's Jovelry Store, 1423 Washington Avenue, Miami Beach, Floriea,
who resides at 453 SW 10th Street, Miami, stated in substance as follows:

In approximately 1959, SUBJECT helped form FRACC in Cuba vhen it became
known that the Castro regine was turning Communist. SUBJECT claimed that at

that time HE was a member of Castro's Naval Intelligence. HE alleged that HE
attempted to obtain help from the American Enbassy, but the only help HE re-

ceived vas from a COL Sanvel Louis Bouque (phonetic), then the US Military At-
tache, who rade personal donations to FRACC but offered no official help. When
SUBJECT could not obtain official aid, HE and the other members of FRACC went mn
underground. Source declined to reveal the names of other persons in FRACC for
fear of jeopardizing their security since some menbers were still in prison in
Cuba. In approxirately March 1961, SU3JECT escaped from Cuba when HE learned
that HE was deine investigated for subversive activities. Since coming to the
US, HE bas been working with about 50 persons living in various parts of the US
in order to send aid to members of FRACC in Cuba. SUBJECT declined to reveal
the names of these members in the US. As yet, FRACC has only been able to send
very small amounts of aid to FRACC at sporadic intervals and through clandes~
tine means, They do not have any stockpiles of arms or material and do not
plan to initiate any action without the approval of the US Government. There

is no forcal organization of FRACC in the US; however, SUBJECT claimed that

the FRACC metbers in the US could be organized and trained in-a matter of four
or five weeks to send supplies and ams to Cuba. SUBJECT believed that there
were approximately 4,000 to 10,000 persons in Cuba who would support FRACC fo-
mediately if they had assurance that FRACC did, in fact, have supplies and the
Support of the US. SUBJECT claimed that HE was in contact with menbers of FRACC
in Cuba (some still in prison and others in high positions within the Cuban
military), NFI, who were awaiting support. SUBJECT had no definite military
plans but believed that FRACC could overthrow the Castro regime from within,
rather than by means of an invasion involving the US, if they bad the proper
supplies and support. SUBJECT was referred to the Miami Field Office by Roy
Hargrave, presently a patient at Palm Springs General Hospital, 1475 U 49th
Street, Hialeah, Florida, Through Hargrave, SUBJECT tet an individual who
claimed to be a Captain .n the US Army Reserves, not further identified, who
stated that he cduld train SUBJECT and the other members of FRACC.

(HISCFLLANEOUS) Cn 18 June 1970, pfs WO D2... who resides
at 9515 SH 95th Avenue, Mizmt, Florida, telephone 226-4646, and who was born 14
February 1940 at Saint Louis, Missouri, was interviewed in his hospital roon,
361B, Pala Springs General Hospital, 1475 49th Street, Hialeah, Florida, where
he fs im convalescence fron a ruptured spine. Hargraves, vho has known Manuel
AGUILAR stated in substance as follows: :

Source became interested in becoming a mercenary in 1961. He later
cane to Miami and was able to gradually work himself into the ranks of volun=
teer mercenaries within the area who wanted to go to Cuba to assist in the

overthrow of the Castro regime. Hargraves met Gerald Patrick Hemming, whose
present address is 2668 Santa Anita Avenue, El Monte, California, telephone
442-3641. Hemming, referred to by Source as "Jerry", is presently the presi-
dent of a Los Angeles Ironworker's Union but was, at the time, working for a
private patrol agency, or investigative agency out of Rosecead, California.

The owner of the agency yas FUU Hoses. Jerry was the organizing force behind
the volunteer militery serecturs fro 1962 to 1964. While working for Heraing,
Sow ce met Felipe Vidal-Sentizg’ who had been the Chicf of Maritime Police
under Castro an? later becare t 2 Military Attache to Colenbia, South America.
Santf 30 defected to the US in+ 960. It was through Santiago, in 1961, that
Sourcé met SU3JECT vho is also pom as "Minola". Accerding to Santiago,
SUBJECT could be trusted, vas 1 "vel headed but was apt to disobey orders when
HE fe that there was sorething more important to do. Santiago related that
SUBJEC! had worked for Raul Castro's right-hand man, a seven-foot Negro named
Heetc, Aldamas. Following Santiago's defection to the US in 1960, he re~
peatedly sent money and supplies into Cuba by way of SUBJECT. SUBJECT was the
wan and was sending out reports, but suddenly, without varning, HE

e island and came to the US in 1961. HE was not known to lie about any
nacters, but Santiago believed HIS reports to be sozewhat exaggerated.

o Prior to working under Castro's adninistration, SUBJECT had spent
line years as a cell leader against the Batista regime. It vas during this
period that HE had organized a large group of persons who worked under HIS
‘jqeontrol, Source could not recall the name of the organization but subuitted
that the people who worked for HIM then are now some of the top officials in
the Castro administration.

SUBJECT approached Source approximately four days ago (15 June 1970)
tfand related that HE had ~ plan HE wanted to execute against Cuba. HE stated
that HE had the organization end the people and that KE felt certain that HE
could make it work. HE stated that HE wanted to take the plan to the "right"

people in order to obtain US support. HE related to Source that HE was willing
to obtain certain items frou within Cuba in order to prove HIS vorth and abili-
ty. HE proposed to have some of the top officials defect to the US; the defec-
tion of the majority of a crew, to include the Captain, of a new KOMAR patrol
boat; and the obtainment of the newest jet aircraft supplied to Cuba by the
Soviet Union. In return SUBJECT wanted a guarantee that the persons coming out
lof Cuba would be free to remain active against Castro, as opposed to being sent
into exile somewhere in the US. Additionally, SUBJECT wanted to retain the
OMAR for action against Cuba or be supplied with a vessel of similar features
with which to operate. SUSJECT related that HE already has an island chosen to
use as a base of operations, hovever, Source could not supply the name or loca~
tion of the island. SUBJECT retains a strong feeling that if the people who
defect to the US, during this demonstration of ability, are left to operate
against Castro, then the people inside Cuba will rapidly join the movement.

The defection of the KOMAR patrol bost, as well as the jet aircraft, can be
accomplished in a matter cf a few weeks. SUBJECT is simply waiting for the
"green Light" from someone in a high position.

As an additional requirement SUBJECT stated that following HIS suc-
cessful procurersnt of material and people, HE wanted & guaranteed pipeiine of
supplies and equipment from-HIS base of operations to the guerilla units operat-
ing inside Cuba. Proposed methods of infiltrating the material into Cuba were
described as beach landings, which would be simplified by the fact that SUBJECT
has access to the patrol schedules of Cuban and Russian vessels operating
Jaround the Cuban nainland. Additionally, SUBJECT presently has people of the
organization poised to sabotage radar installations along the Cuban coastline.

In reference to the orgenization, allegedly active within Cuba as
well as the US, and under the explicit control of SUBJECT, Source mentioned
that “cells were organized throughout Cuba as well as dispersed in the US.
SUBJECT bas maintained contact with all of the cell leaders by an unknown
Imethod. Names of the members could not be furnished; however, Source stated
that .he visited SUBJECT unannounced and met two individuals whose names he
could not recall, however, he believed them to be members of Alpha 66.

Source questioned SUBJECT concerning the men and Alpha 66, and SUBJECT stated
that ME would not include them in any activity or proposed plans because HE
knew that plans of Alpha 66, once formulated, were common knowledge in Cuba
hours after the plans are conceived. Source believed the name of one of the
individuals was Minola Buy. Source also believed that SUBJECTS organization
had a training atea in the Dominican Republic.

cording to Jerry Herain,, both Howard and Hall wet with
Bota in Texz3 while enroute to Florida prior to the John Kennedy assassination,
After President Kennedy was killed, Hexaing related to Source that he felt that
the assassination was a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plot to do away with
Kennedy since Howard and Hall were believed to have been connected with the CIA.
Source, at a later date, confronted Howard with the question concerning his part
in the alleged connection with the Kennedy assassination. Boward "clasmed up"
and became nervous concerning the master and avoided the subject completely.
Additionally, due to Source's long involvement with military civilian movements
against Cuba, a man by the nace of Steven J. Burton, who presently resides at
4829 Morella Avenue, North Hollywood, California, telephone 766-1916, came to
Source's hone while he was living in California, following the Robert Kennedy
assassination and displayee photographs of Sirhan B. Sirkan in efforts to make
