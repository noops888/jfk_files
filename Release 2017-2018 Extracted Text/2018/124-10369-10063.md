MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

23 NOV 1963

Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Assassination of President Kennedy-Reported

Anonymous Telephone Message

1. The following cable from the CIA Station in London]was reported

orally to Mr. Sanel Papich at 0930 on 23 November:

The British Security Service (MI-5) has reported that at

1805 GMiT on 22 November an anonynous telephone call was made in

Cambridge, Ingland, to the sentor reporter of the Cambriäge Neve.

The

caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the

American Embassy in London for some big news and then hung up.

After the word of the President's death was received the re-

porter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call and the

police informed MI-5. The important point is that the call was made,

according to Mies calculations, about 25 minutes before the President

was shot. The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this

kind before and MI-5 state that he is known to them as a sound and loyal

person with no security record.

4. MI-5 noted that similar anonymous phone calls of a strangely

coincidental nature have been received by persons in the U. K. over the

past year, particularly in connection with the case of Dr. Ward.

5. The British Seeurity Service stated its desire to assist in

every possible way on any follow-up Investigations required within

the United Kingdon®
