February, 1958; but he

acknowledged he could not recali

exactly when.

He said he could not now recall ever having

seen FBI Form 5-88. "He replied that, since he. folt he had

never placed a name or

address on. the.

"watch. list," he

would not have any specific results routed to his personal

attention. He added, however, that if the results were

routed to all supervisors concerned with Soviet intelligence

and related matters, he probably did see such results

and routinely initialed the accompanying routing slips.

He said he could recall no specific ClAresults" 11; in

lact, he did see anything specific.

Dick aaled whether Schweppe was aware of who

designated the routing of the lists he had seen; and

Schweppe responded. that he assined it was some individual

In the office of the

division's Assistant Director who

performed such an administrative function. Schweppe said

he did not

recall & Miss Triplett (phonetic), who,

according to Dick, was responsible for routing the "Hunter

Project" material to appropriate supervisors.

Schweppe

said he could have been Included in such routing because

Dick also queried Schweppe about his knowledge

of the

"SAM. Survey" (SAM) and "Z Coverage" (2).

asked Schweppe whether he knew

when "SAN" and "" were

Initiated, what they consisted

of, when they ceased,

"Say" woults of those projecte.

Schveppe replied that

that he in time heard about then through office "shop

talk" and then concluded that those designations indicated

projects in which mail

to and/or: fron the Soviet Union and

Schweppe suggested that on later

inquiry. about the

source of the correspondence he was

informed it was oither from "SAM" or

"Z. "

He said he Fas

unable to recall specifically who so advised him.

He felt

it was possible that word was just "passed along"' to that

all such material translated by bim was dirocted to officials

at the Soviet and/or Soviet bloc embassies in Washligton,

and not to any son diplomatic personnel. Such
