SECTION #1-A

ANALYSIS ABOUT THE POLITICAL INFORMATION WORK:

BACKGROUND:

The M-A task presents some deficiencles. undoubtedly i

product of the minimum exploitation of its

informative resources

nd to the lack of orientation with regard to the informatior

that is needed.

different characteristics:

c) THE CARIBBEAN.

An analysis of each follows.

a) MEXICO

The lack of information about MEXICO and events taking

place there is really alarming.

Concretely we can point out

that we do not receive any information about the internal

political situation of Mexico.

This deficiency can be easily overcome if attention is

paid to the ordentations of the guidelines and objectives

plan, since the Contes in Mexico has contact capabilitles

the political forces of the country, at the necessary

level, it appears, to obtain this type of information.

we don"t know what the relations are be-

tween the Center and these informants,

therefore we cannot

guide the information collection effort.

b) CENTRAL AMERICA

The Information with regard to this region is still

worse than in respect to MEXICO. As far as political in

formation is concerned, we note

the absence of sources

of information and of concrete information about current

matters.

Information about the political life of these countries

Is almost nil, especlally with regard to current matters.

In-

formation about political matters

is frequently received from

this region, but almost always they refer to reports from a

source about his

own party or about disagreements,

very generalized, with other leftist forces.

lately, for the last three or four months (actually

since early September), a decrease in the total volume of in

formation ecceived has been observed, especially with regard

to intolligence information about the national liberation

movement in Central America.

With regard to other matters

(political life,

relations with Cuba, solidarity, etc.) the

fact is that we

have received information, although very

May, two or three information reports of limited value and

NEEDS:

a) MEXICO

Given the importance of the situation in Mexico, for

Cuba,

basically bycause it is an important way of contact with

Latin

America, It is NECESSARY to reinforce our job as far as

Its RELATIONS

WITH. CUBA is concerned.

This means that we are

interested and need to intensify our work with the official

organizations.from Mexico (Presidency, MINREX, Congress, etc.)

having somothing to do with Cuban relations, so as to have

the elements of judgment and information about the future of

these relations and above all of the North American plans and

pressures on

MEXICO with rogard to their relations with Cuba

and the Mexican position to that respect.

especially. with regard to leftist forces and their role and

importance individually.

And lastly, it is necessary, in our opinion, to develop

an orynnized and

methodical task,

according to the guidelines

and objectives of the plan, with the available sources of in-

formation from the Section or the Contor in Mexico so as to

usc them more rationally.

IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT TIAT IN

THIS SECTION,

AS WELL AS

IN M-S, A TENDENCY TO OBTAIN INFORMA

TION FROM SOURCES IN CUBA IS NOTED.

b) CENTRAL ANERICA

In this rogion it is necessary to emphasize the obtain-

of information about plans

ofarression in Cuba, espe-

cially with regard to possibilities of collective action

against Cuba.

On the other hand, work should be

strengthened with

regard to the situation

and plans of the national liberation

movement in the region and in each country.

An effort should

be made to get to know,

completely, what the role and the

of every leftist force is, since there are countries,

like Nicaragua,

where it is not known, due to lack of informa

what role each force

and which are their

relations with us.

Ne consider

that we must establish con

tacts to work constantly and periodically with each of the

leftist forces in these

countries. Only this way we will be

able to overcome the deficioney.

c) The situation in these countries is very serious, from

the standpoint of the infornation work.

As we have said, we

have no information about them. We consider that the first

is to know the sources from which we can

obtain information and at the same time establish contact

with all the friendly forces in order to obtain information.

ANALYSIS ABOUT INFORMATION OY ENNY ACTIVITIES WORK:

BACKGROUND:

About the information work with countries in the M-A

Section with

regard to

Internation about counter-revolutlonary

type andasression plans we can point out, in general, its

principal successes ard doficiencies.

Through previous experience and the analysis of informa

tion received from the countries of this Section concerning

counter-revolutionary actlvities, it was confirmed once more

thnt this

ty the zune preferred by Imperiallsm

for locating

training camps for counter-revolutionary elements, getting

to the point whore this assumes serious charactoristics in

certain places or specific zones. such as the case of the

Peten zone in Guatemala and Puerto Cabezas and the Maiz Is-

lands in Nicaragua.

From Informaiion about this type of activity we can

point out that some was incomplete and fragmentary, observing

in many cates

the absolute lack of exploitation of a source;

this

fact meant from the standpoint of our work serious

dif

Ilculties, since this limited considerably our possibilities

of indirect confirmation,

that is, through other different

sources, a

well as a sortes of derivative difficulties such

as the lack of continuity in the information, lack of con-

flimation, lack of contact and guidance as to the source

objectives. etc.

Analyzing all those previous phenomena

we can point

out a

definite guideline with regard to our work for this

Section during the forthcomino year, this guideline would

cover the following aspects that will be basic from the

standpoint of aggression plans.

Location of training camps for Cuban mercenaries,

to the type of training they get and their

number, as well as their resources.

2. Detection of enemy aggression plans through the .

Armed Forces

of Contral American

countries

and through the so much mentioned collective action,

or something similar.

3.

Location of oporations bases for pirate launches and

countcr-revolutionary groups that will operate from nearby

countries.

This is

directly related with the plans for

penetrating the enemy.

Penetrate and have full information about enemy's anti-

guerrilla plans and its development.

These would be the tasks

to be developed during the year. accordingly, and following

the general

guidolines and objectives of the current work.
