S)

randum of Conversation, Dan
S ~Rather/Les Midgley and the DCI,
Qs Dated 6 September 1975

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and that. ve crept up every so often
since then. In one form or. x, the allegations. are
that Lee Harvey OSWALD had/@een connected with the Agency.
The allegations are totauty

2. The facts re;

make a tho; checkswithin the Agency at Headquarters
to determin&whe: Harvey OSWALD had ever been
used by the Agenc\or been connected with it in any
conceivable way. ie ordered me to make the checks
directly and personally to the degree possible and not
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R.
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the
Agency's key contact officials with the Warren,
Commission.

a. On 2,

b. Although I had already checked: the Main Index
of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I
rechecked the Main Index and found no- record beyond
that which I had already obtained.before (plus. those
items which had been integrated into. the records system
since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO
recoras which indicated any Agency connection with |
OSWALD. |

jpriate stations, I was told, and the
results negative. :
4. I recall very clearly that we were extremely
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American\returning
from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by
DCD, thus having established contact with’ the Agency.
The same point has now, quite understandably, been made
by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this |
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid
reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time. H
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite |
uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in j
those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade ES @ were so many persons travelling to |
and from the Soyre®SUnion that DCD was incapable of talk~ {
ing to all of fhem* Therefore, a program of selectivity
and specificctaxyet applicability was instituted. In |
light of th@\aBove/Chk seems to me that OSWALD-- if he
s n¢iwn at all--would have easily been i
simply did not possess the type of
was seeking at that time. DCD would
ts limited manpower on travellers who
ater access in the USSR.

Se hould be added that my above-described
search in She Agency file holding produced no record or
indication that any other US Government agency had -used
him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

26 November 1963 - 11:20 a.m. ~

DC: I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situationin Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so. :

H: We have had the very best support that we could possibly i

expect from you.
DCL: Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.
EB: We will feel free to do that \
DCI: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.
H: We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man ete. that fired the gun. But there is no question
that he is the right man. There are a lot of aspects that we have
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter i: Mexico City.
We have now found that the: photograph that was ta cen was not

that of Oswald. We do find from our informant dowm there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has -
given us the conversation that he had, He wanted to get a permit
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit, The Soviet Embassy stated that it waild take three
weeks. He had, I think, ‘a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States. H

DCL: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have
those operational sources down there. We want to handle them
very carefully. It involves some very high level people down
there. Sam ee and I have talked about that a couple of times.

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned
in it. State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc.
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the .
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be
sure that whatever is said in the report is conférred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

Well that will be fine. Thank you

ion's desire to interview him at 1030. AM v

2. The DDP wishes to have from you a sit LS
comprehensive memorandum which highlights the bastt issues or
positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the
Commission. For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission
would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements
might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they
will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-
spiracy existed, Such general questioning certainly necessitates
that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous
interviews. I r@iged with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent
information whic] are processing which originated with the
sensitive WH-Souree. I informed him that in your view. this would
raise a nunher’ ‘of x factors with the Commissi; that it should
not go tothe & mn prior to the Dire ctor' appear: ge unless

Once recruited as possible OY. ¥ ‘separated froa the others and placed
in D@L houses, where they receive i ion as agents. Their life is normal;

they use the cover of being scholarelitp students supported by the Cuban government.
The DGI supplied then clothes, food, and every sort of care, such as medical and
any other kind, The DGL takes care of their general expandsese .

Ordinarily kx an attempt is made to kesp then from contact with mx anyone in’
goverment circles so as to avoid indiscretions. Any agent recruited in a foreign
country is brought to Cuba and arrangements are made so that he has no contacts
with persons in Cuba from his om country or any other. Onco his. training is
completed, his departure from Cuba is not made known to anyone attached to hime

In recruitment of Cubans, an effort is made to find those knowing the fewest
possible persons. “If the Cuban who is recruited is employed in an office or
factory or works sote other place, an effort is made to have him continue his
work so as to vse his situation to provide true cover; instruction is given ab
hours when he is not working. If the agent has any trouble after he has been
reornited, the DGI tries to help hin as much as possible without breaking down
congartrentation or his covers

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the OGI covers the ex-
penses of his fanily. If a Cuban who is recruited is unemployed, it looks for
a cover adapted to his situation, and the OGL tates care of all ths expenses
the agent has, including those of his fanily if he is married. He receives his
training in the hours adapted to bis cover position. His life, Like that of the
agent who is working, mst contime normal, just as it was before recruitment.

On 17 December Mr. Papich Ry

anticipating a request from the tqmiission, named by President
Johnson to look into this case, for coples of Bureau materials
supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-
vided me vith the attached copy of portions of a report passed by
the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with the/Sylvia DURAN
aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States
Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich
inquired as to whether information in this report might be given
to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some
other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.
The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-
vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others
in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed
to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of
the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this
manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to
telephone taps.

uber and after
was agreed with
Mr. Papich that when the Bureau is facg@ problems of this

the Bureau should

Mr. Papich again raised the question on 19

not pass to the Commission infore@N RRR Agency, but should
refer the Commission to the ABE @Wional information.

Slawson and Coleman discussed the cable traffic from the Soviet

and Cuban Emoassies both during the time of Oswald's visits

there in September-October 1963 and immediately after the

assassination, Scott and White said that no increases or

unusual variations had been noted at either time. We then dis-

cussed briefly the possibilities that the National Security
Agency might be able to "break" the nodes for the times when
Oswald was in Mexico City, using as a key the fact that
Oswald's attempt to obtain a visa was probably communicated to
Washington on Friday or Saturday, September 27 or 28. Scott
pointed out that all his office did with coded materials was
to send ‘them back to the National Security Agency in Washington
in the form in which it obtained them. They felt that the code- '
breaking might be RES however, and should be tried. i

it would be an easy distance and a natural direction to walk.
The hotels near this particular bus terminal are almost all

it would seem very possible that Oswald could have been

be used. Only the substance of conversations would be given.

FROM: W. David 1 pedi elIED
SUBJECT: . Letter to a Cen’ gence Agency (CIA)

+ Posing Certain Suasiione: on their Letter to Us
dated 31 January 1964

I would include in our letter to a CIA the following
_ Questions:

1. Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged
meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was
_ Supposed to have taken place in an automobile outside the
Cuban Enbassy in Hexico City? -.--

2. Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet
Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? If you
do, can we find out its contents?

3. Reference is made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your
letter. Would it be possible for us to see the full report
‘of the Mexican police interrogations of eae Duran and her
husbarid?.. . : Bee

4. Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald,
"that same afternoon," came back “again” to the Cuban
Embassy. Does this mean that he was there twice the same
day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous
day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the
Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this
sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed information
found in the subsequent paragraphs. In general, we would
appreciate as much gla

on as you can give us on the
time sequence of. th¢ P aragraph 7. Of
course, if you are a the full text of
the Mexican police Saat je can try to piece

out the time sequence PROMS E
5. Reference is ma tS i D. in which

Mrs. Duran. refers to sieiectactre data" on Oswald which she
found in the Consulate "archives." The use of these terms

6. Reference is made to ti TED sentence in the 2nd
subparagraph of paragraph 12b. Is there any significance
to the word, "Although"? We wonder whether the informant
meant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran
reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued
to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

7. Reference is again made to the 2nd subparagraph of
‘paragraph 12b. our letter states that Mrs. Duran told the
Soviet Embassy” that Oswald“knew no one in Cuba; and that
the Soviet official “echoed her statement that the American
. _ was not known." It is unclear to us whether this discussion
. . 4nvolved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet
- officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not knowing
anyone in the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies.

8. Reference is made to paragraph 12c. Was the "direct
conversation" between one of the members of the Soviet
Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was
at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that
Mra. Duran sent Oswald personally over to the Soviet Enbassy

- ta” contact.” one of tha officials there? . -~... .

9. Reference is again made to paragraph l2c. Could
you glarify the many references to the "address" referred to
50 frequently in this paragraph?

10. (‘Throughout your entire letter the term "Soviet
Consulate” seems | to be used Anterghangeably with the term
"Soviet Embassy,“ Likewise with "Guban Consulate” and
"Cuban Embassy." We assume from this that the Soviet
Consulate and the Soviet Embassy must be the same in Mexico

27 JUN i963

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence
SUBJECT: QuWIN

1. Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make
the following recommendations concerning the further handling
and possible disposition of QJWIN:

a. I believe the original purpose for which
QJUWIN was continued and sent to his present under-

cover assignmen g ient validity
to justify the if yond the
termination of his present contract for this purpose

corm, sf ROMIRTTED sveent, vets

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles
in Europe where we have very few assets. Whether this
is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends
on the determination of how he can be used either by °
the German Station, or by the Austrian Station or by
any other KUBARK re eae a long term unofficial
cover agent. He is not being used at the present time.
He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any
operational assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of
Station Luxembourg and RABNEY be consulted by
Headquarters for their best recommendations as to
the continued use of QUWIN. After these recommendations
are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian
stations be consulted for their possible interest in
using him. If after these discussions a sensible
framework for the operational use of QJWIN can be
established, I would recommend we continue him. If
not, I would recommend that he be terminated at the
time his present contract expires.

2. As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation
which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for
security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully
familiar as I orally advised you on 26 June 1963, except for
one precautionary "life line", aspects of this case have

been terminated AED PGA gent perhaps for minor
accountings, be coi 4 eT a

1, It makes little HitRbeb , DWOOD had at one time an

OI interest in Oswald. As soon as I had heard Oswalf's name, I recalled
that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sometime in Summer 1960 --
‘with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the layang
on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable channels. At the
moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family
were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

Je ee

2, I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck >
me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I
told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get
the information we need, because this individual looks odd."j We were
particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on thé Minsk
factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city
itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop
target personality dossiers. .

3. I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at
the time, Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's artival.
I do not know what action developed thereafter,

REPRODUCTION, cose

4. As an afterthought, I recall also that at the time I was becoming
increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered
in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet \
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually ~
divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "home".
The AEOCEAN 3 case. was among the first of, these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases, We established links between
some of these women and the KGB, KUDESK became interested in the developing
trend we had come across, It was partly out of curiosity to learn if
Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of
interest in Oswald's own exper: d in the U SSR, that we showed operational
intelligence interest in thegtarvsy story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Repart conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that ~
effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

£.1 Dissemination. to the Intelligence Community
E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission
E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by
