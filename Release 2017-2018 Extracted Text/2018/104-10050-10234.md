Connection with the Agency

Memorandum of Conversation, Dan

-Rather/Les Midgley and the

DCI,

Dated 6 September 1975

ISASCE!

B::00

The referent memorandum contains two points

which require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

The allegations are totalfy wtfounded.

2. The facts regarding this matter are as follows:

Noyember 1963 I was instructed by

• Mr. R.G. Roccas

my immediate superior at that time, to

make a thorough

check Within the Agency at Headquarters

o determine whethen tee Harvey OSWALD had ever beer

used by the

Agencyfor been connected with it in ans

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the warren

Commission.

b. Although I had already checked: the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus: those

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination).

There was nothing in the DDO

records which indicated any Agency connection with

that the results, showed that Lee Harvey OSWALD

had nexer had any

connection whatsoever with the

AgenCy. Eventually a statement to this effect

was comunicated to the Warren Commission.

Similar

checks regarding use or employment

Of OSKAID Kad been requested by the foreign divisions

of their appropriate stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

I recall very clearly that we

were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American returning

from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by

DCD, thus having established contact with the Agendy.

The same point has now, quite understandably been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

reason for DCD'g lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before

1957/1958.

Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that

and we were hungry for eyewitness information in

The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end

of that decade there were so many persons travelling to

Therefore, a program of selectivity

and specific target applicability was instituted.

should be added that my above-described

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation, in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and 1 am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.

We have now found that the: photograph that was ta en was not

that of Oswald.

We do find from our informant dom there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had.

He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it waild take three

weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there.

We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

Matz- link

Mr.

Katzenbach

who is handling it for the Department

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

that will be released to the public, probably through the White

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be

checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned

in it.

State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of

the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc.

all of which of course we are gathering.

The aspects of the

Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned.

It is his

intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be

sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned.

So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said

and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

Well that will be fine. Thank you

Good bye.

The DDP wishes to have from you a

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basit issues or

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WiKsource. I informed him that in your view this would

we have first had some preliminary reaction of made sure that the

Director is fut aware of its implications since it could well serve

He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache 1a Mexico CIty dealing with the Sylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that

some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich

Inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad

In which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make

available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps.

Mr. Papich again raised the question on 19

12:00 Noon to 3:00 p.M.

After having decided among ourselves what further

work had to be done while we were in Mexico, we went to

fir. Anderson's office where we met kir. Anderson and Rolfe

Larson. The following points were covered, with the conclus-

Once again we asked Anderson to review the Gutierrez

either being prepared or that had already been sent to

Washington on this matter which we had not yet received. We

were told that there were not. The status of the Cutlerrez

1. One of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate other

See paragraph 1l of the

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

Consulate at least twice and probably three times-

This seems so because:

a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or

Wednesday.

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban

Consulate at least once on Friday and at least once on

Saturday, see CIA memorandum, pages 6 through 8.

Friday and that he REDRODUCTIO one to the Russtan

and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which

Silvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip

of paper with her name and telephone number; because Azque

telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,

see paragraph 4 of this memorandum, and Oswald was given

W. David SIP ROHIBITED

Letter to the Central

gence Agency (CIA)

*Posing Certain Questions on their Letter to Us

dated 31 January 1964

I would Include in our letter to the CIA the following

questions:

Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

supposed to have taken place in an automate catside the

Cuban Eabassy In Mexico O1ty?

2.

Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet

Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? II you

do, can we find out its contenta?

3. Reference is made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your

letter.

Would 1t be possible for us to see the full report

•of the Mexican police interrogations of hrs. Duran and her

husbard?.

"that same arternoon, " came back "again" to the cuban,

came back "again"

to the Cuban

Embassy.. Does this mean that he was there trice the same

day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous

day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the

Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this

sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed Information

found in the subsequent paragraphs. In general, we would

appreciate as much car cation an you can give us on the

out the time sequence

We wonder whether the informant

to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

Reference 1g again made to the 2nd subparagraph of

Your letter states that Mrs. Duran told the

the Soviet official "echoed her statement that the American

It Is unclear to us whether this discussion

1. It makes little lif

EDWOOD had at one time an

01 interest in Oswald.

As soon as I had heard Oswall's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed - sonetime in

Summer 1960 --

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the laying

on of interview(s) through KUJÜMP or other suitable channels.

At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family ..

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

2.

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck »

me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

the information we need,

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

3.

I was phasing into my IPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

the time.

Thus,

I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's arrival.

I do not know what action developed thereafter.

4. As an afterthought, I recall also that at the time I was becoming

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "home".

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases.

We established links between

some of these women and the KGB.

KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across.

It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1

Dissemination to the Intelligence Community

E.2

Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file.

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form

CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
