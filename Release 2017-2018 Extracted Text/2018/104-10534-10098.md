SUBJECT

Office of Legistative Counsel

Rodger S. Gabrielson

: Transmittal of OTS Files for Permanent

Retention by OLC

During the recent records review conducted by the

Office of Technical Service at

OT'S surfaced 4

files that pertain to Lee Harvey Oswald.

These files were

not found during any previous OTS searches because they

were filed by "Case Number"

, not by name. These files are

no longer needed by OTS, and they are being turned over to

the Office of Legislative Counsel for their permanent re-

tention. The files in question have been reviewed by Mr.

of the Office of General Counsel and they are

transmitted herewith as attachments to Form 141c.
