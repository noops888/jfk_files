had done by having the liaison officer come back and forth
and my recollection is that I advocated that we just sort
of wait it out and see what happened.

MR. OLSEN: Did it enter into your thinking in
that connection, Ambassador, that little could be done by
attempting to compel Mr. Hoover to do anything in any event?

THE WITNESS: I didn't think there was a chance of
Attorneys General being able to persuade him to reverse
himself.

MR. ROETHE: Do you want to go into a different
area now?

MR. OLSEN: Yes.

MR. ROETHE: I will sort of rest my thought here
for a few minutes.

BY MR. OLSEN:

Q Are you acquainted with the general subject of the
handling of a defector by the name of Nosenko?

A Yes.

Q Did. Nosenko defect to the United States at the
time you were the DCI?

A I have forgotten exactly what my job was when he
defected. Could you give me the date when he defected?

MR. ROETHE: I believe it was in 1965. I think it
was just before you -~

THE WITNESS: Became Deputy Director?

MR. ROETHE: Yes.
THE WITNESS: Because I didn't become Director until
1966, I believe.
MR. ROETHE: This was in 1965.
BY MR. OLSEN:
Q When was it that you became Deputy Director?
A I think it was in April 1965.
Q In any event, you are acquanted with that whole

situation --

A Yes.
Q -- are you not?
A Yes, I am.

Q Who specifically within the Agency had charge of the
initial handling of Nosenko?

A Normally, defectors were handled by the Domestic
Contact Division of the Office of Operations, but it seems
to me that this fellow was given a special treatment all his
own and I don't recall who it was that did have him in
custody, whether it was the Security Office, the Counter-
intelligence Staff. I just honestly don't recall.

Q Well, would it be of any help if I suggested
to you that the Office of Security was actually in charge of
his confinement?

A That is what I was wondering.

Q But that the Counterintelligence Staff was the

Agency that directed what was to be done with him:.and
conducted the interrogations of him and specified the condi-

tions under which he was to be kept, and so on?

A Right.
Q Does that refresh your recollection?
A That helps a great deal because he was held down in

the installation we have here some miles from Washington for
quite some months while an effort was being made to find

out whether he was a bona fide defector or not a bona

fide defector and one of ‘the complicating factors as I

recall it was that he had made some sort of statement to the
FBI when he arrived in this country that he was going to
become a part of the Warren Commission report and we could
not seem to ascertain clearly enough that the fellow was what
he claimed -to be and, therefore, the statement might have been!
contaminated and might. have affected the conclusions of the
Warren Commission. So I think this case went on for a long
time in our efforts to get all of this sorted out. But I
remember this was important enough that I sought a conversa-
tion with the Chief Justice who was Chairman of the Warren
Commission and talked to him, you know, one afternoon -- I
don't know if it was morning or afternoon but I talked to

him in some detail about this matter privately so that the
Warren Commission would not necessarily be misled by this

man's testimony which we were not able to vouch for.

Q What was it that Nosenko testified about or told
the FBI that he had.a relationship with the Warren Commission?
A I have forgotten. I am sure it is all in the
Warren Commission records and I have forgotten the precise
details of it. It had something to do with Oswald's time in
the Soviet Union.

MR. ROETHE: Isn't it true that the material was
never put into the Warren Commission, that you were successful
in convincing them to leave it out?

THE WITNESS: That was my impression.

MR. ROETHE: This is in fact a memorandum you
prepared for the records, isn't it, on your talk with the
Chief Justice and that is dated June 24, 1964?

THE WITNESS: Well, if it was June 1964, then
Nosenko must have defected before that.

MR. ROETHE: I guess you are right. You are right.

BY MR. OLSEN:

Q In June of 1964 your position with the Agency was

what?

A I. would have been then the Deputy Director for
Plans.

Q Did you immediately succeed Richard Bissell?

A Yes. I was his Deputy and then I succeeded him.

Yes, That is certainly my signature and it confirms that-

ever I can recall about this.

Q Can you tell us what your impressions were as to

the justification of the Agency in retaining for such an

extended period of time the physical custody and person of
Mr. Nosenko?

A We were simply trying to establish his bona fides
one way or the other. We took a very long time and had a
very hard time doing it for reasons, detailed reasons which
I don't recall, but I certainly remember that this was a
very difficult case for us. I even believe we went down to
talk to Mr.Katzenbach when he was the. Deputy Attorney General
in an effort to see if there was any way we could get assist-
ance from the Department of Justice about what our responsi-
bilities or our authorities or anything else where in the
case of a defector who put himself in our hands who might be
a spy on the United States and what we could do to somehow
get this whole thing sorted out. Needless to say, the
Department of Justice wasn't able to help us. Since we. had
the responsibilities for handling defectors in this country
and we also had the responsibilities for establishing their
bona fides, this was the reason that he was held for so long.
We tried various things. I. remember that I asked one of my
Deputies who was then Admiral Rufus Taylor who had been
Director of Naval Intelligence before,to spend full time
attempting to sort out this case, see what we should do next

about it, how we could get it regularized, et cetera. It

just turned out to be a very difficult thing and I agree that
he was kept an inordinate amount of time.
Q Was it your feeling that there was just simply no

satisfactory provision of American law to handle this kind

of case?
A There really is not, sir.
Q And that was your feeling at that time?
A Yes. And I don't know of any even now.

Q Did you feel that the Agency had in good faith
exhausted all alternatives that appeared to be open to it?

A Yes. I really thought so. We spent a lot of time
on this case.

Q To try to find a legal or proper way to handle it?

A That is right. Proper solution to it.

Q a it the conclusion of the Agency that Mr.
Nosenko just simply could not be released?

A That is right. If he was a Russian spy then we

just found ourselves not in a position to be able to certify

that he was not.

Q Wasn't there some procedure that was available to
the Government of the United States with respect to deporting
him if his bona fides couldn't be determined in a reasonable
period of time?

Q I don't know whether this device has ever been

used. I am not familiar with it.

think we have ever deported any defectors no matter how much
of a nuisance and pain in the neck they have Bae The only
ones that have gone back are the ones that asked to go back.

arrangement under which Mr. Nosenko was being held? Was the
White House privy. to this?

Q Was the Congress privy to it?

discussing it with the Congress.

General?

A Yes, the Deputy Attorney General, he was at that
time.

Q Was -he told of the specific conditions under which
Mr. Nosenko was being held?

session at that time, whether there were some other gentlemen
with me and we had just a general discussion of this case.

which he was being held?

accorded similar treatment by the Agency?

A. Well, there was one bad case, I don't know when
it was, Many, Many years ago, when some Agency interrogator
was interrogating, I think it was some Russian or I think it
was -- I don't know whether it was a Russian or a Balt. or
somebody who got carried away An actually was physically
abusive to this individual. And as soon as that came to my
attention, that was not only stopped but the fellow who was
responsible for it was fired. And it was --

Q Was this at a period of time when you were DDP?

A It must have been or even before that. Maybe I

was Chief of Operations. I can't remember. But it was a long

time ago.
Q Did this occur inside the United States?
A Yes, and it was made abundantly clear at that time

to everybody that nobody was going to be manhandled any

more forever.

Q Is that the only instance --

A Only instance.

Q -- instance in which you know that happened?

A That I recall, yes, and I don't even recall the

year it happened.
Q Do you remember the name of the person involved?
A No, I do not. I think it could be ascertained

without too much difficult.

Q Was any personal injury inflicted on the individual?
A No. He didn't die of it, wasn't crippled, but it

was just they manhandled him some.

Q Was it a matter of losing one's temper or systematic
torture?
A I don't know. I think this fellow just exceeded

himself and exceeded his authority and thought by using some
force he would get some kind of confession out of this fellow.
Anyhow, I disapproved it and I don't remember the details.

Q Has there been any instance that you know of in
your entire career with the Agency, Ambassador, in which
a defector, an employee, an agent, an operative connected with]
the Agency, has been killed?

A I know of none.

Q By the Agency?

A I know of none. I recall none.

Q Or at the behest of the Agency because of his being
a security risk or a traitor?

A Non, sir. I know of none.

CIA by the name of Copeland?

A Who?

Q Copeland.

A How could I have avoided him.

Q In a fairly recent book called "Without Cloak
and Dagger", Mr. Copeland describes a category of situations
in which penetrators, defectors, that is, defectors from
the United States, people who have furnished sensitive
information to foreign governments, disposed of with extreme
prejudice, the implication being that they are killed, and
that this is a practice that is employed by the Agency from
time to time.

A I do not believe Mr. Copeland.

Q Do you know of any such instance occurring within
the Government of the United States?

A I do not.

Q What is your impression as to the source of such
information and representations by Mr. Copeland?

A Mr. Copeland is a fancifier. What is more, he is
a liar. What's more, he is one of the most dishonest ‘son of
a bitches I know.

Q Is it your impression, then, that this matter is
just a figment of his imagination?

A That is my distinct impression.

Q Was his departure from the Agency anything that you
had something to do with?

A No. I think he quit to go to work for some oil

oil company in the Middle East. It is only in recent years

Q I would like now to turn to the matter of the relati
ships between the Agency and the:Warren Commission in
connection with. this study of the assassination of President
Kennedy. I take it that the Nosenko case was at least one
instance in which the Chief Justice was briefed on a matter
that was ‘not covered in a general briefing or presentation to
the Warren Commission as a whole, is that true?

A Yes.

Q Was the Nosenko matter also one that was not presen
or investigated by the staff of the Warren Commission?

was. I just don't know. I ‘just honestly don't remember.

Q Did you take over any role from Mr. Bissell with
respect ta the followup to the’ Bay of Pigs after that
disaster?

A Well, after I became Deputy: Director for Plans
there were all these ongoing operations about Cuba which
we covered yesterday with -- who was it -- Mr. Belin went
into this in great detail about the Mongoose Operation and

all that business, the assassination theories and-how this
’

might be done and that might be done. We spent a long time

on that yesterday afternoon.

Q Well, you were acquainted, then, with the fact that

after the Bay of Pigs venture there continued to be a.very
substantial amount of CIA activity among the Cuban exiles and
other Cuban emigres in the southern part of the United
States?

A Oh, yes. We had a big station in Miami and there
was big pressure from the Kennedy Administration, from
President Kennedy himself and the Attorney General, et cetera,
to upset the Castro regime. No question about that. I mean
the records are just copious on that. The Government records
should be. I don't know where all the Mongoose records are,
whether they were kept in the Department of Defense or here,
but there were certainly lots of records.

Q Well, the Agency. was very~much involved, then,
in that effort. of. the Kennedy Administration?

A Yes.

Q And the Agency continuéd to sponsor and finance and
help organize Cuban groups, revolutionary groups, anti-Castro
groups,in the southern United States?

A Yes, certainly.

Q Were you at that time acquainted, then, with the
fact that a great many Cubans or Cuban-Americans were

involved in these CIA organizations?

A Was I aware of this?

r
Q Yes.
A Yes.

of Cuba.

Q Most ofthem had left Cuba in 1959 or 1960?

A Somewhere, or were even coming out at the time this
was all going on.

Q Were you acquainted at that time -- I am talking
eo the time you took over as Deputy Director for Plans in

1962 -- with the fact that there was among these Cuban emigres

a high level of hostility to Fidel Castro and the Castro

government?
A That was my impression.
Q Were you also aware of the fact that there was a

high degree of interest in disposing of Castro and his
administration among these people?

A I think there was a high degree of interest on the
part of the U.S. Government for changing the Government of
Cuba. No doubt about it.

Q Was there also a high degree of interest in that
same objective on the part of the..Cuban.emigres?

A Well, I had always thought so because most of the
emigres that were in Florida at the time had fled from
Cuba because they were anti-Castro. They obviously would. like
to have gotten back under a more benevolent government and

resumed their life in their own country, so I think most o

them were rather dedicated to the cause of upsetting the Castr

government.

Q Do. you know whether there was during this period

“of 1962 and thereafter a great deal of talk among the Cuban

emigres of plans to assassinate Castro?

A I don't know about plans to assassinate him. An
awful lot of suggestions were made all through this Governmen
about how one. got rid of Castro, how one got rid of his
government. Whether the Cuban exiles in-Miami were talking
about assassination plots or were trying to work things out
I don't recall specifically. I just recall that during this
period there was a major effort made to carry out. sabotage
in Cuba, to do what we could to agitate the Castro. government,
and all kinds of plans and theories and options were put
down and discarded or tried or whatever the case might be.
A lot of theories were enunciated which weren't practical.
There was a great deal of effort being put into this. I
believe they showed me a memorandum yesterday which I wrote
after talking to the Attorney General at one point which
indicated very clearly the dissatisfaction of the President
and the Attorney General with the success of the efforts
up to that point. I mean, that is one of the exhibits in
yesterday's testimony when Mr.Belin was here.

November 1963, and after it became known to you that the

individual, Lee Harvey Oswald, was believed very broadly to

New Orleans, in that direction, that there were at least
reports that he had attempted to penetrate the anti-Castro
groups in New Orleans and possibly elsewhere, did anything
get suggested to you -~ did you hold any conversations with
anybody about the possibility that the assassination of
President Kennedy was a retaliation. by Oswald against the
activity, the talks and plans to assassinate Castro?
A No. I don't recall discussing that with anybody.

I don't recall the thought ever having occurred to me at the
time. The first time I ever heard such theory as that
enunciated was in-a very peculiar way by President Johnson.
I don't even remember what time it was. I heard him’say in
my presence -- I don't know that the comment was even directe
at me -- that because President Kennedy had been responsible
for the death of the President Diem of Vietnam that this was
why President Kennedy had been shot himself, and I couldn't
see how the two things were even remotely connected, plus
the fact that I think it would be pretty hard to demonstrate
that President Kennedy assassinated Diem or shot him or
anything like that. Maybe he put into effect the course of
events but that is the only connection with the assassination
I ever heard but I never heard of retaliation by attempts

on Castro's life.

necessary or desirable that anybody from the Warren Commissio:

Warren Commission?

A" Nobody ever mentioned it to me. And I wasn't
Director of the Agency. I wasn't deciding what was going to
the Warren Commission and what wasn't. I was just answering
inquiries from the Warren Commission.

in New Orleans. This is what attracted my attention to
Garrison, plus his reiterated statements that the CIA was
responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy, and
that was how I knew about Jim Garrison. I obviously followed
in the finig about the Clay Shaw trial, and so forth, which

there was some later attempt to pick out a person who
appeared to be an American Going into the Soviet Embassy?

A Yes. There was some photographs of a man who has
never heen identified. Nobody has ever figured out who it
was as far as I know. Time was spent endlessly figuring
out who this man might be. The FBI went over it, we went over
it, everybody you can think of went over it and as far as I

in which the Warren Commission did not fairly present to the
American public the results of its investigation that had
CIA aspects to it?

A Not that I know of, sir. You know, I have been one
of the ones, that as these various books have come out and
allegations made, and so forth, thought to myself, my
God, how could the Warren Commission have done much more
than it did?. It seemed to me they had a very good staff of
lawyers and they were.very. conscientious and hardworking and
the FBI helped, CIA helped, and everybody helped as far as
I know, and I always thought the Warren Commission report
was probably first class. I haven't’ read it all, it is too °

by the Commission --

A Is this the Rockefeller Commission?

Q Yes. The Rockefeller Commission, in which an Agency,
past. Agency official, has expressed the opinion that Premier
Castro had a pretty effectiveintelligence operation going in
this country among the. Cuban emigres. Would that accord
with your own impression?

A I really don't know. I do know that the Russians
have done what they aa to improve the Cuban Intelligence

Service but how effective the Cuban Intelligence Service has

been in its work in the United States I have no. way of knowing}
Q Has this Agency within your knowledge, Ambassador,
ever been penetrated by a foreign intelligence agent?
A I don't know, sir. I hope not. We recognize that

we are target number 1 for the KGB. That has been told us

by various defectors. Over the years we have donesour level

best to fend off efforts. We have identified what we thought
weré a couple of probes in this direction at various times.
But if.the Agency has ever been penetrated I am not aware of
it, although I have to say that anybody who is Director of
the Agency every day when.he.walkssinto the building wonders
whether if that is the day that somebody will be turned out
that might be a penetration of the Agency, but I know of none.
Q Have there been any instances that you know of in jl

debate has raged within the Agency as to whether a particular
employee is an agent of a foreign government?

A Well, I think that, you know, as we were saying
earlier, just this afternoon, from time to time there has been
a feeling that maybe that fellow might have been a recruiter
or this individual might have been, investigation is conducted
in an effort to see if this is the case. One hopes that the
investigation is good and adequate enough to clear the
individual. We have used the polygraph wherein-there was
some question about. these things. We have used all the
techniques that were reasonably available to us to try to
prevent this:happening and I don't know. There we are.

MR. ROETHE: Were there occasions when you terminated

employees. under your authority to terminate without any
question because you thought there may be some suspicion that

could not be eliminated?

THE WITNESS: I can't remember during my time as
Director this happening. I believe that before I became
Director there were a couple of cases that were of dubious
validity about individuals who were thought possibly to
have had some unsatisfactory connections and were terminated,
but the case was never proved against them as far as I was
aware. And I don't know of any cases that as Director I

terminated that way. At least I can't think of any. It would

be very easy to ascertain. this, though, and I wish you would,
