Regarding the information condemnine since

the 1957 Appalachin Meeting,

COTRONI has been a member of the "Mafia". Our opinion is

that COTRONI has had control or played a major roll in

directing all major criminal activities in the Montreal CANADA

area and as a result derived

an enormous financial benefit.

This

conclusion has been reached as a result of information

subsequent to the Appalachin

attended the Appalachin Meeting, but was one of several

persons who escaped apprehension.

Persons of importance who have had contact

or dealings with Vic cotRont in the past and who we

consider could be part of the COTRONI organization are

as follows:-

Further to memo from H.Q. Assistant C.I.B. Officer

dated 12 FEB 65, requesting information relevant to the

involvement of the COTRONIS, GALENTE, GRECO, otc., with the

BONANNO Lamily at this time, please be informed of the

following.

2.

There exists a definite link between BONANNO and

these other Individuals. Joseph BONANNO Alias "BANANAS" FPS

No. 891104 1s alloged to have entered this country as early

as 1938.

In 1954 Carmine CALENTE ALIAS LILLO THE CIGAR

FPS No. 815013, recently. reported by Joseph VALACHI as an

-underboss to BONANNO, considered a top U.s, hoodlum at the

time, took over the Montreal Syndicate. He controiled

organized gambling, protection rackets, stock frauds, gam-

bling, among other

major crime specialties.

He was known

to have dictatod on policies relevant to the Syndicate's

operations.

EPS No. 389562, a woll known

"Edge Man" HarryDAVIS, following the latter's slaying in

1946, was known

as strong arm man for GALENTE's newly formed

edent'ed canadian Syndicate. He lost his job in 1955 and subsequently

aisappeared mysteriously in 1956.

PETRULA 18 reported to

have had close associations with Harry SHIP, FPS.No. 47477,

a top, syndicate member and Luigi allas Louis GRECO FPS No.

815813, then considered an enforcer for the syndicate.: By

1956 the vico syndicate controlled all forms of crime.

It Is at this juncture that Police opinions are

most conflicting and speculative.

The chain of command

as presented earlier 1s generally accepted.

Following PE-

TRULA 's disappearance, one conjecture is that the city

divided into two distinct and separate

East End Gang" and "The West End Gang".

groups, namely

Othersmaintain that

this division was never made at all in terms of area but

rather in relation to the typo of crime committed.

5.

Irrespective of the motivations, the city was

divided.

Replacing PETRULA we find that Harry SHIP had

control of the West End with GRECO as his counterpart in

the East End." The West had the French Canadian and Jewish"

elements whilst the East comprised mostly of Italians and a

lesser number of French Speaking followêrs. This

Vincent COTRONI

THIS SET-UP WAS in evidence as late as 1961 when ViC COTRONI

FPS No. 183003 was roported as gradually taking over both

East and West.

His brother, Frank COIRONI FPS No. 648069

with Giuseppe COCOLICCHIO FPS No. 758891 were responsible

for the East End.

sinilarly Peter ADAMO FPS NO. 35459%

and wittiam COs FPS No. 90104 had control of the West End

mob also under Vic COTRONI.. LOUis GRECO's decisions, as

an enforcer were relegated to and acted upon by vio COTRONI,

his chief Lleutenant, until the late 1950. At this timo, an

internal struggle was boginning to show between the East and

Wost factions.

The Jewish element from the west were gra-

dually loosing ground and the COTRONI mob bagan showing con-

tempt.

At this juncture, SHIP is shot at from close range.

Ho was wounded in the legs and obviously it was only inten

ded to scare him into submission rather than an attempt on

his 11re. salomon SCHNAPP FPS No. 963768, an Influential

This wo consider,

blow to the last and west divisions.

6.

Prior to the East-Wost amalgamation, a second

theory, less probable than

the first, was also advanced.

Sinco

Carmine GALENTE was using both

LOUiS GRECO and ViC

COTRONI as enforcers as early as 1955, a two way split in

crimo specialties may have existed..

GRECO could have hand

lod drugs, gambling, stock frauds, counterfeiting, book-

making and receiving.

ViC COIRONI, through his associates

may have been responsible for prostitution, bonds and secu-

rities, hold-ups and major rackets.

Drugs could have been

an open field.

Bootlegging Into one another's specialty

could have beon tolerated within reason with some measure

of control.

Since 1961, VIC COTRONI's Influence and prestige

within the syndicate

1s known to have flourished rapidly.

We suspect that he is presently the Commission boss. His

brothers Frank and Michel COTRONI are considered his enfor-

corsa

GRECO, on the contrary, 1s renowing acquaintances

with potty hoodlums. As a result his activities are becoming

Increasingly susceptible to detoction.

GRECO 1s also report -

ed financlally on the decline.

This figures since he now

Referring to Para. 2 where a request is made for

the nares of 20 menbers whom we feel belong to the Montreal

"Docina"

Inasmuch as we are convinced that the "Cosa Nostra

has oxtended its tentacles here, we have no evidence to sub-

stantiate the

existenco of even one "Cosa Nostra" family in

Montreal.

We have roceivod no information at any time to

the effect that other than CALEVIE, any of the local commis-

sion belonged to this organization as we know it to function.

The allegation that BONANNO, In 1964 came to form a family

of "borgatta"

cones as no surprise.

Had he been given the

opportunity of settling here, this may have come about.

Between his incarceration, legal proceedings and subsequent

deportation, it is most doubtful that he had made any gains

at forning such a family, particularly since the Montreal

group wanted to bo loft alone.

Since we have been alerted to the possibility of

be borne in mind and any information of value will be
