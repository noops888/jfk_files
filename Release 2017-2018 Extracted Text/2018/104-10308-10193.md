ANGER OPENLY OM THE SOVIET UNION BECAUSE. IT WAS HE AND
HIS BROTHER RAUL WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVING CUBA SO
DEBPLY INTO THE "SOCIALIST CAMP" DESPITE AT LEAST THE
INITIAL RESISTANCE BY SEVERAL OF HIS PRINCIPAL FOLLOWERS,
FOR EXAMPLE, PRESIDENT OSVALD DORTICOS AND FOREIGN MINISTER
RAUL ROA. THUS TO ATTACK THE USSR PUBLICLY WOULD BE TO
. ADMIT THAT HE HAD MADE A MAJOR ERROR WITH RESPECT TO THE
CONDUCT OF RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION. REALIZATION

NATIONAL GAME WILL BE PARTICULARLY -GALLING TO THE CUBAN

“IF, AS SEEMS TO BE THE CASE, IT IS AS A RESULT OF HIS
TRIP TO MOSCOW THAT SOME OF THE MISSILES WERE SENT TO

THAN THAT OF FIDL, RAUL IS POTENTIALLY CAPABLE OF
ADOPTING AN EXTREMELY HARD LINE AGAINST THE SOVIETS,
HIS REACTION WHEN HE FELT THAT THERE HAD BEEN BETRAYAL,
EVEN BY COMMUNISTS TO WHOM HE WAS FORMERLY CLOSE, WAS
