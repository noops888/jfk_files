we noted that the Senate Select Committee had in its possession
certain materials, which were compiled by the Commission on —y.
CIA Activities Within the United States, for the preparation }
of its report to the President, which matetials most probably |
contained information regarding FBI operations of the utmost
sensitivity. In order to avoid any inadvertent compromise of
such information, we requested an opportunity to meet with
Senators Church and Tower at the earliest convenience to
discuss areas of this Bureau's activities which might warrant
special consideration, Senator Church agreed that the above
matter would be discussed with Director Kelley at the latter's
appearance before the Executive Session of the Senate Select

Committee meeting scheduled for et be
le a-ue s7y Goo

For your additional information, this Bureau had
earlier ascertained that the Senate Select Committee has had
access to a 693-page document prepared by CIA listing instances
wherein CIA believed its operations may have exceeded its
mandate, A review of this document by Bureau personnel indi-
cated that some of these operations involve matters involving
this Bureau of an extremely sensitive nature. In response to
a request of CIA for copies of pertinent material contained.
in the above 693-page document, CIA on this date furnished
copies of the material requested. B JUL 22 1975

In anticipation of the Director's appedranté before:

of approximately 174 pages was reviewed, This material is a

Epstein inquired as to whether Campbell had ever
seen the tapes again after he hed departed the hotel, Canpboll
advised that souetine later, possibly one or two months, he
vas asked to review tha tapes and logs in an effort to obtain
additional information. He did this at the FBI Laboratory
and was agsisted by SA John Matter, retired, in the technical
enhancement techniques, such as filtering. Campbell was not
digected te concentrate on any one part of the tapes but
ceviewed all of them. He did not type any of the informtion

done in the Intelligence Division, Campbell has not seen
the tapes sinee that tine,

On Epstein's inquiry, Campbell advised he first
heard about the planned interview of him from SA Paul V. Daly

Epstein then stated lets get to the point. When
did you hear about the King case. I responded that some-
time early in 1964 - recalled since it was shortly after
President Kennedy was shot/and King was named man of the
year - I was summons to the SAC's office either by my
associate Bill Bergeron of my supervisor Mr. Belter not
specifically recalled. e SAC, Marlin Johnson, Assistant
Director William Sullivan, Bergeron and probably several
others not recalled were in attendance. The following is
a narrative of information I furnished in response to
Epstein's questions.

The SAC made several remarks and Assistant Director
Sullivan then stated that he did not want any information.
discussed to leave the room. Sullivan stated he had informa-
tion that indicated King was associating with communists and :
it was possible his movement was being infiltrated. Sullivan
said he wanted a technical installation on King in an effort
to verify this information. =

7 At some Later. daté I was assigned to monitor the
installation which was a radio transmitter. I could not _
recall if the equipment was signed out to me or not but I
took the equipment home and on a Sunday afternoon I caught a
bus to Union Station, I walked around for a short time and then
by cab went to the hotel and checked in under an assumed
name (name not remembered). I did not recall who made my
reservations. The first night King did not enter the room -
we were monitoring. (I did not recall the names of
individuals who occupied room but they were associated with
King party.) The next day we (John Borys of WFO and myself)
moved to a different room. I could not recall how the
arrangements for the move was made. We then monitored King
for about two days, stayed one extra day at the hotel, and
checked out. Either Borys or myself stayed in the room at
all time. One would take the logs and tapes out of the
hotel each day and turn them over to someone from WFO (details
not recalled). At no time did I ever enter any room in the
hotel that was occupied by King or any member of his party.

The tape recorder was manually operated and we attempted to
run it any time someone was in the room. I know of no physical
or photographic surveillance on King during this time. I

had no instructions that I can recall concerning only listening
to certain types of conversation.

~2-

NW 55037 Docld:32989617 Page 10



Epstein asked if I kept a card at the office
showing my location. I responded that it was the normal
practice to place a card in file when one was away from
the office. In this case, if I placed a card in file I
probably would place a notation like "Special - See
Supervisor Belter for contact."

I had never seen any paper, memos, etc. (other
than logs) dealing with this case. ;

Epstein asked if I ever saw the tapes again io
after departing the hotel. I stated that sometime after
(possibly one or two months) I was asked to review the tapes
and logs in an effort to obtain additional information. I
did this at the FBI Laboratory and was assisted by SA John
Matter, retired, in the technical enhancement techniques ~
such as filtering. I was not directed to concentrate on
any one part of the tapes but reviewed all of the tapes.

I did not type any of the information and if it was typed
it was probably typed in the Intelligence Division. I have
not seen the tapes since that time. .

I first heard about my interview from Mr. Daly of
the Legal Division and did not discuss this case with
Mr. Bergeron, Mr. Matter or Mr. Borys after that contact.
I do not know if the tapes are still in existance.

3 UN

Porie-asked if it was the normal practice to
erase tapes. I stated that in this type investigation I
was sure only new tapes were used. I was certain the tapes
were new if they were still wrapped in cellophane and they
had the appearance of new tapes. She also asked how I got
the key for the second room at the hotel and did I have
to re-register. I stated, I did not recall but felt sure I
did not re-register and some agent from WFO probably got
the key to me. No other person entered the rooms except
Borys and myself where the monitoring was taking place.

Other responses to questions from Epstein were:
We only had one radio receiver and only listened to one
radio microphone, I could not recall if there were others.
Borys and myself took turns listening to the transmitter.
I did not remove the transmitter when I left the hotel as I
never entered any of the rooms assigned to the King party.

NW 55037 DocId:32989617 Page 12

One final question from Epstein. Is there anything
else about this case that you know that has not come out
because I did not ask the right question or asked a question
in the right way. I advised I felt he had done a good job
in asking the questions.

Additional answers to questions. I did not
know any details concerning Mr. Sullivan's remarks about
King's association with communists. I did not attend all of
the meetings at WFO concerning the King installation. My
best recollection was that the monitoring was in rooms one
floor above the rooms occupied by King.

RE: TWWERVIEd OF FORMER FBI AD BY SSC

Conrad was told that the SSC was focusing on an
allegation that some tapes were made of a conversation of
Martin Luther King, Jr., and that these tapes were mailed
outside of the FBI, Conrad was also told that tha SSC had
baen advised that Conrad had been requested to make copies
of such tapes for the indicated purpose of mailing outside -
the FBI. Conrad was then asked what he knew about this
matter. His ansver was that he did not know or recall
anything that vould £it the deseription above. Conrad asked
Epstein if the lattor could indicate a time frame which
might assist Conrad in his recall. Epstein said they vere
referring to the early 1960's, after which Conrad responded
that that was a long time ago and Conrad was just unable to
recall anything on the allegation. Conrad vas asked if he
recalled making copies of a tape dealing with King without
knowing it vas for the purpose of the tapes being mailed,
flis response vas "Ilo.

Conrad vas asked if he had known that the FBI had
technical coverage of King. His response vas, “Jot specifically."
He was then asked what ha meant by specifically" and this
peint was pressed by the interrogators. Conrad responded
that he recalled that FRI Director Hoover had announced
publicly that the FBI had in effect a number of wire taps,
thus indicating that a number of FBE subjects who were under
investigation were thus covered through such means, Hovever,
Conrad did not know or recall that King was cubed one of
the subjects of such coverage.

Conrad was asked whether he recalled, aside from
the King case, vhether any recordings were sent to the
Laboratory for processing or copying when they related to

and he responded that, if the request was from the field,
there vould normally be a cover communication vhich vould

be the permanent record. Hovever, if the request vas from
a Headquarters official, there might not always be a written
veeord, He was asked how the material would get to a specific
person in the Laboratory and he responded by saying that it
might be routed directly by the sender or routed to the
Laboratory generally, and then from the central routing
point in the Laboratory it would be sent to either RE or the
speciZie person who vould handle the matter, Conrad was
asked how a router would know vhere te send such an item and
he responded that there would be information in the caver
communication vhich vould assist in this routing.

Conrad was asked whether it vas necessary to
account by inventory for all tapes used in making copies of
tapes. He ansvered that it vas not so necessacy because
the volume vas so small. He was asked if he knew whether
any tecord or memorancum vas made of such a request in
connection with’ the King case and responded that he did not
knows; that he had no recollection, He was asked if it was
possible that such a written record might exist and if so,
would it not be in FBI files? He answered that he did not
think he could contribute to this question as almost anything
is possible, He added, however, that he had no knowledge or
xvecotlection of such a record or any knowledge of its
existence in FBI files.

He was then asked if he had ever heard of mailings
of tapes involving King. He replied that he had seen something
in a revspaper within the past year or tio indicating such
an allezation. His recollection vas that the news account
vas of a copy of a tape being mailed to Mrs. King, and that
Mrs, Ring had denied receiving same.

I did not know the agent to whom the case was assigned.

Dote of transcription O7 18-75

Mr. Paul Wallach, staff member of the Urited States Senate

Select Committee cn intelligence Activities, telephonisally contacted me on
6-18-75 between 2:20 and 3 o'clock P.M,, and inquired as to the status of a
request ky the Committee concerning mail cover information. He asked if 1
: could furnish him a time when he right expect our response to be delivered

tohim. He pointed out that he had had previous discussions with me and
i Mr, Shaheen of the Department concerning this matiez, and Mr. Shaheen”
had indicated to him that he could expect the response to have been given to
: him by this time. Mr. Wallach was informed that a tine certain for
of a response concert this request could rot be given, and it
was explained to him that a va Mmount of material wes being reviewed
pursuant to request of the Senate Select Committee ant other “committees of
Congress and that because of the amount of werk involved in all these requests
it was not possible to make a jadgment as to the date d the response,

Mr. Wallach indicated he felt he had been uisied by Mr. Shaheen
into believing that he would have a responsé to his reqrest and that he was
going to recontact Mr, Shaheen. He made a general irquiry as to whether one
Agent might be gathcring all the information and as to whether he might be
allowed to come to FBI Headquarters and review what tas been gathered to
this point. He was informed that all disclosures have ‘o receive proper
am Bureau approval ana that it would not be possible for him to review such
information in the absence of such avproval. He askedif the Bureau could
separate the response hy making available immediately portions of the mail
cover lists such as the identities of*people who were tie targets of maii

was a national list in the national security areas, He dated he was not sure

He was advised thai the list would contain sensitive information
which would seriously impair ongoing Bureau invéstigations. He replied that
the names were not classified, and since they were not classified he would
have no problem in using the list, It was explained to Mr. Wallach that
despite the fact it was not classified the list would be extremely sensitive
since it would impair many ongoing investigations and in many instances the
very fact that we are interested in an individual indicates that we are in
possession of Sensitive information concerning that individual, Mr, Wallach
pointed out that if this were the case, acknowledging that he had been informed -
previously that one of the reasons for the necessity for closely reviewing the
material to be made available was because of this problem, then the Bureau
should come forward with its own list and point out to him which of the names
are sensitive and which are not. Mr. Wallach stated that only one or two
other people had knowledge of the fact he possessed such a list.

Comittee - June 18, 1975 - 4:20 p.m.

: Paul Wallach called 1 O'Connor, but t tock the call. Welach
stated that his call to O'Connor was to express his personal
(concern over O'Connor's questioning his (Wallach's) professional
ethics in an earlier telephone conversation witth John ELliff of

. SSC staff. Wallach expressed the hope that Schwarz's conversation ~

~ with O'Connor in which Schwarz categorically disclaimed that Wallach
had made certain specific representations ‘to Paul Daly of the FBI
earlier, would put to rest all of O'Connor's concerns vis-a-vis
Wallach. (O'Connor's concerns were aroused by my report to him of
a Wallach call at about 3:00 p.m. to Daly in which Daly stated that
Wallach claimed that he (Wallach) "had the NSC mail covers going
back five years" and had received same with mames listed from a

source that Wallach refused to disclose. ‘Daly further reported

that Wallach stated that unless the Bureau wes not inmediately
‘ forthcoming with the SSC's request for the NS mail covers, he

(Wallach) would use the ones in his possession.) I told Wallach

Mr. Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel Division, and n

morning of 7/2/75, Also present at the meeting were the
Deputy Attorney General and Messrs, K. William O'Connor,
Kevin Maroney, Michael Shaheen and Robert McDermott, all of
the Department of Justice, The purpose of the meeting was
tto discuss three specific matters the first. being the arated
letter dated 6/25/75 to the Attorney General from Senators
[Church and Tower (see memorandum Wannall to Adams captioned d

as above dated 6/30/75). The second matter discussed was ; q
the Task Force concept. The third item was a review by FBI a

found considerable difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of
the 6/25/75 letter pointing out that neither the Department of

of the ambiguities the Deputy Attorney General found in the
letter as well as the lack of any specific agggement entered into with

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

the Deputy Attorney General instructed that the Department

prepare a letter over the Attorney General's signature

asking, for clarification of the 6/25/75 letter as well as

raising the question of any agreement entered into by the
. Department or the FBI,

¢ TASK FORCE CONCEPT j '

The Task Force concept is designed to identify
various abuses which the SSC desires to investigate in-depth.
A member of the intelligence community would be identified
to the Executive Branch as a Task Force leader. The purpose
would be to permit that Task Force leader to be completely’
knowledgeable on all available information throughout the
intelligence community for a particular abuse. In other
words, the White House could look to the Task Force leader
as the one person in the intelligence, community who would be
privy to all information regarding a particular abuse. The
Deputy Attorney General had no problem with this concept but
did insist that the Task Force leaders should not negotiate
directly with their counterparts on the SSC on behalf of
the intelligence community for any particular abuse (fhe
White House has insisted on this), Thé Deputy Attorney General
instructed Mr. O'Connor to make this quite clear to
Me. James A, Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President,
and if Wilderotter insisted on unilateral negotiations between
Task Force leaders and the SSC, Wilderotter should be referred
to the Deputy Attorney General in order to resolve this issue.

THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION FILES

As. you know, the President has ordered that copies
of the Rockefeller Commission files including testimony be
turned over to the SSC. There has been no third agency
' coordination on the part of CIA regarding what information
was turned over to the Rockefeller Commission, As a result

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

of the above, we are not aware what sensitive information
‘involvirg the FBI has been furnished to the Rockefeller
Commission by CIA.

The Criminal Division of the Department has received
copies of the entire Rockefeller Commission file plus testimony.
The Deputy Attorney General has ruled that these files and
testimony cannot be .turned over to the FBI in toto until
such time as the Criminal Division has ruled on any possible
eviminal culpability on the part of the FBI, To faciliate
the review of the Rockefeller paeseaiae files, the Griminal
Division will separate out any informdlion it feels involves
any FBI criminal culpability. That portion separated out
will be the subject of di cussion between ths Deputy Actor put vy Attomey
Genstel and the Dinector. The remaining portion of the

key elier files will then be turned over to the FBI for
review to determine if any of the information contained therein
could possibly jeopardize sensitive ongoing investigations

or adversely affect the security and welfare of FBI sources
mentioned therein,

The Legal Counsel Division is preparing a letter
alerting the SSC to the possibility that sensitive information
may be contained in the Rockefeller files and requesting that
Senators Church and Tower consider a briefing by FBI officials —
regarding those sensitive areas of concern to the FBI which
may be embodied in the Rockefeller Commission files.
