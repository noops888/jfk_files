SUBJECT

Joseph Raymond Merola 42849

1.

DCD's only recorded contact with Joseph Raymond Merola

priOr

to August 1961 occurred on

6 February 1961.

It followed

a series of telephone calls over a period of several months

in which Merola

had expressed interest in oftering his assis-

tance in connection with Cuban matters.

The DCD officer had

declined contact until 6 February when Merola claimed to have

information on a Brazilian senator who was a "close friend

and confidante" of "Che" Guevera.

Because Guevera was the

subject uf requirements levied on DCD, our officer agreed to

a meeting.

The

substance of the 6 February 1961 meeting is

described

in report 00-A(S)-3179213, dated 8 February.

(This

report has been returned to the Agency Archives,

but will be

retrieved and reviewed for classification.

Should it carry a

'Secret classification.

it will be downgraded to "Confidential"

and may be so considered for the purposes of this inquiry.)
