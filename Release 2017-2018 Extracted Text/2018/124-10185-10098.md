was following this potential defection and pursuant to estab-
lished procedures was keeping interested agencies apprised of
developments. On September 15, 1958, we received information
indicating that another Government agency was conducting an

investigation of the subject. t was later established that
CIA was the gther agency. (Re Bureau file

39. CIA ACTIVITIES; IN S)

The Legal Attache, Tokyo, reported by letter dated
er 22; 1958,/that
was a paid, Nighly regarded, and very sensitive source

of CIA. ¥This information was given to the Legal Attache b
G2 Head in Japan, According to
CIA did not want this_information to be known to other agencies;
particularly the FBI. The Director's notation was, “Some more
of CIA double dealing? H." (Letter from Legat, Tokyo, dated
September 22, 1958, "Investigations in Hong Kong and Manila,
Philippines")

40. ALLEGED CIA INCOMPETENCE

was given by the U.S. Air Force. Among the activities was a
lecture given by ] Subsequent to the (S)
briefing, General Millard Young of. the Air Force confided to 2
Bureau representatives and expressed his displeasure with the ,
briefing given by ] He was particularly critical of S)

reluctance to furnish certain information, using the &S)

Young stated that the position taken bye only an(s)
excuse for incompetence on the part of . ~

use the foregoing as evidence to support a position that we were
obliged to be circumspect in dealing with CIA. (Memorandum

Seminar, Orlando Air Force Base, Orlando, Florida, October 20-25,

show that many more people were involved in the Castro organi-
zation than the U.S. Government had realized. Information
coming to-our attention suggested the possibility ‘that both
State and CIA had failed to assess developments in Cuba properly.

The foregoing is cited in e event that we found
reason to question the competency os fata in Cuba] This coulé&)
be useful if we wanted to justify the existence of a Legal =
Attache office in Havana. One could also comment that poor
coverage in Cuba had an indirect and adverse effect on our
operations in the United States.

By letter dated April 25, 1959, we voiced our

objections to CIA for giving guidance to an individual with

whom we had been maintaining contact for, the purpose of developing

him as a double agent. The individual involved wa:
a well-known expert in the field of
medic: applied to /space flying.
Also a contract agent of CIA and d-occasion to handle Sensitive
matters for that Agency. I pril, [1959, was preparing
to make a trip to Moscow. C. prieféd him on matters as they
applied to his trip. The Agency also interviewed him concerning
his relationship with the subject in Washington, D. C., and,
furthermore, gave him guidance concerning the relationship.

We objected to CIA giving any guidance to| oncerning/ S

is contacts with the subject without fir ng with us.

43. ALLEGED BELITTLING OF COMMUNISM BY ALLEN DULLES

In July, 1959, Allen Dulles of CIA Spoke at the
National Strategy Seminar of the National War College. One
of the professors handling the Seminar was critical of. Dulles.
He claimed that Dulles had belittled the importance of the
communist problem.) :;

_. On February 7, 1962, Colone Sheffield Edwards,

Director of Security, CIA, informed the Liaison Agent that
CIA was preparing a report containing extremely sensitive
information. He stated that this information came: from a
sensitive Source and he was not certain as to how it should
be handled, As a result of a discussion with Edwards on
February 26, 1962, it was asc rtained that CIA had maintained
a technical surveillance ont ——ppver an extended period. (S)
Edwards explained that he had beén reluctant to identify this
-gource at an earlier date because he feared that prosecution
could have been jeopardized and, furthermore, he did not want
his Agency embarrassed in the event the Bureau objected to
CIA maintaining a capability such as technical surveillances.
It was made emphatically.clear to Edwards that it was absolutely
necessary that we be provided with all the details and, further-
more, that CIA, at the outset, should have apprised us of the
lexistence of the coverage. The Director made the notation,

"I only wish we would eventually realize CIA can never be
depended upon to deal forthrightly with us. Certainly my
skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion, but on
specific instances of all too many in number,’ Yet, there
exists wistful belief that the ‘leopard has changed his
spots.' H." (Memorandum Branigan to’ Sullivan February 27,
1962, ["Unknown Subject; KGB Agent Kaown 25 tsacha'"}| 6)

ss. [NS

In February, 1962, the Liaison Agent was requested

to discuss with CIA a case which, in our opinion, clearly
indicated CIA had failed to keep us appropriately informed
of developments, The Bureau's original interest was initiated
in Miami as a result of a discussion with CIA personnel in that
city. Attempts to get CIA replies via correspondence were

- megative. On February 13, 1962, the Liaison Agent discussed 7
the matter with CIA and received a reply which did not adequately
satisfy the Bureau's request. (Memorandum Donahoe to Sullivan, :

February 27, 1962, and Brennan to Sullivan, March 2, 1962; Bureau

~ 57. {CIA WIRE TAPPING IN THE UNITED STATES |

oO

Sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs f

é at
asco, CIA had ya

become involved in a weird pian designed to bring about the
assassination of Fidel Castro. One of the principal ingredients
of this plan was to. be the utilization of U.S, hoodlums. CIA :
established contact with Robert Maheu, former Bureau Agent, who
served as. the intermediary in dealings with the notorious
hoodlum, Sam Giancana. (<} :

\

The entire operation fell apart when we developed
information indicating that Maheu was behind a wire tapping
operation in Nevada, Potentially, there were elements for
possible violation of unauthorized publication or use of
communications, However, prosecution was out of the question
because of the tainted involvement of CIA. (Arthur James Balletti,
"Unauthorized Publication or Use of Communications" and memo-
randum from the Director to Mr. Tolson, dated May 10, 1962)

In October, 1962, we lodged a protest with CIA
because the Agency initiated operation of Cuban agents in the

Miami area and in so doing violated Bureau jurisdiction,
Arrangements were subsequently effected where the source in

the matter was turned over to the Bureau for handling, (Memo-
randum Brennan to Sullivan, October 29, 1962,

‘On April 23, 1963. CIA requested that the Bureau
establish coverage on a visiting/Panamanian] national, W <S)”
immediately instituted investigation and en determined at
CIA actually had been instrumental in supporting the subject's
trip to the United States, CIA had been endeavoring to recruit
the subject. On April 29, 1963, a strong protest was lodged
with General Carter, Deputy Director of CIA, (Memorandun
Brennan to Sullivan, April 26, 1963, (SS)

60, ALLEGED ATTACK ON BUREAU BY JOHN McCONE

We received information in December, 1963, indicating
that John McCone, Director of CIA, allegedly was attacking the
Bureau in what would appear to be a vicious and underhanded
manner, McCone allegedly informed Congressman Jerry Ford and =
Drew Pearson that CIA had uncovered a plot in Mexico City :
indicating that Lee Harvey Oswald had received $6,500 to
assassinate President Kennedy, The story attributed to McCone
appeared to be related ‘to information which had come from one |
Gilberto Alvarado, a Nicaraguan national, Interrogation of |
Alvarado, including a polygraph, disclosed that he had fabricated —
his story, This had been made known to CIA and to McCone, There-
fore, if McCone had made the above statements to Ford and Pearson, |
it would appear that it would have been an obvious attempt to |
ridicule the Bureau, The Liaison Agent contacted McCone on
December 23, 1963, McCone vehemently denied the allegations. |
