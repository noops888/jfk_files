Counselor interviewed today»
Provious to hia dcning here; counselor talked to the Council for the

» Blind ag. thore.naa nothing we could do for him ond actually 4t waa

_ contrary to ‘our rogulations to aocept him since the modical roport H
AndLoated that"he was industrially blinds Tho Council for tho Blind H

otated that If ho could. s;eak English thoy would attenpt to work with
himy but, of course, with his glaucona, it would be difficult for him

to atulye « 6

? At tho ond of the interview, Moated that because of hie

conoral debilitated conditions he did-not actually wish to got into ony
troining program or adtuslly get into any work situation aa ho hod just
about onough ‘atrengh to alt.up. Cf courno, glauccaa fa pretty generally.
Sonaidored to be progressive in nature end everything concerned and

m ntloned above leaves this counselor with the inpression thet this
individual wil] be @ liability on sore one for the rost of hin life and

1c not exployables

Thorefore, of course, he is not boing accepted into thia rehabilitation

prograne It would be this counsélor's recocnondation that if it wore

possible, that ho be drorped from the.CiC prograa and put on the Cuban

Refugee progran. Thia reccezcndation is in view of the fact, that this

will be a long indefinite welfare cave and it 40 likely that the Cuban

Refugee gonorel progran will be going on long after the CES te closed :
: and vory Iikely, aven shen the Cubsn Refugee program is olosedy they :

would continue on the State “elfaro. Cf course, I am in no position to

‘ know whether this ie lecally possible.
