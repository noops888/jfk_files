Director Howard Osborn reporting a meeting between former OS
Director, Colonel Sheffield Edwards and John Roselli, a
Mafia figure.

Osborn detailing a phone conversation between Colonel
Edwards, James O'Connell of OS and John Roselli.

declassification and release of the two memos. It is noted
the relationship between OS and Mafia personalities has heen
documented in great detail not only in prior official
releases but newspapers and other periodicals.

adversely affect Agency sources or methods of collection.
