MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possibla Additional es board Support Furnished Howara Hunt

1.. We have reported earlier an out-of-channel request by
Howard Hunt for a name trace in December 1971 on a Costa Rican.
This was put back in channels by forwarding the name trace report
to Peter Jessup, who then held the position of senior Agency officer
with the NSC Staff in EOB. eo

. 2. Jessup has submitted a memorandum dated 31 May 1973
(received in O/IG on 6 June) stating that Howard Hunt,

“submitted various names for Headquarters traces
of.certain Latin Americans, not in a sealed envelope.
This was hadled orally and by telephone I advised the
chief of the appropriate division that they were being
forwarded and to consult with the DDP about the
propriety of responding. I also telephoned the DDP.

I then wrote my own memo to General HAIG calling

his attention to the fact that an individual--I named
HUNT--was tracing foreign nationals without reference
to the NSC Staff." :

Haig is reported by Jessup as returning the memorandum with.the
word "thanks" noted on its face.

3. We have spoken with Rob Roy Ratliffe, Jessup's successor
with the NSC Staff, who states (in conversations.on 6 and 7 June)
that it was not customary for Jessup to keep records of this sort
of transaction, and that a‘search of the files does not disclose a
copy of the memorandum to General Haig. Mrs. Evelyn De Pue
(Jessup's secretary at the time and now Ratliffe's) spoke with Mrs.

eae es Headquarters, who reported a memorandum from
ef, ivision, in December 1971 forwarding to Jessup a
name trace on a Costa Rican (the one noted above) for Hunt. No
other such records were found.

4, Jessup is now on TDY at Headquarters and was interviewed
(7 June by telephone and 8 June in person). He first recalled that
"shortly after" Hunt was appointed to the White House--he thinks
before the plumber unit was formed, although this is ex post facto .’

- reconstruction--Hunt made a request for name traces on Latin

Ame ricans. He thinks this involved Guatemalans and Costa Ricans.
I pointed out that Hunt's White House appointment was 6 July 1971. ;
As Jessup discussed it he placed the time the last couple of months
of 1971 or the first month of 1972. He cannot recall how many name
traces were involved, but is certain that the total was more than

one-~"just a. few; five, three, two or four." He enclosed Hunt's

request in an envelope and forwarded it with a. note that someone
had best check with Tom Karamessines as Hunt was no longer an
Agency employee. Jessup says he didn't know what Hunt was doing
or what he had in mind, and was concerned that Hunt might make
Agency Secret name trace material available to outsiders. Jessup's
office routinely handled a low volume of mame trace requests from the
NSC Staff, but always in such instances he knew who it was for and how
it was to be used.

5. Jessup said that his office had little other contact with Hunt.
He saw him in the elevator in EOB once or twice, but never had

-occasion to discuss business matters. Once someone phoned asking

for Hunt's telephone extension (which was difficult to get, as the
White House switchboard did not give out numbers freely). Out of
curiosity he also got Hunt's room number and wandered down (he
recalls it as Room 106 EOB) where he found a sign on the door.

saying "Plumber, "' very much as it-might have said 'Janitor.""-He |
attached no significarice to it.at the time,‘the term 'Mumber" meaning
nothing to him.

6. On one occasion Jessup took his daughter to Blues Alley, and
saw Hunt there with some well-to-do Californians. He thought Hunt
had some association with the place as a public relations man, although
he thinks it would have to be a very small account. I told him of Hunt's
reported interest in jazz, which was news to Jessup. To forestall .
Hunt's thinking that he (Jessup) might be playing around with teenagers
he took his daughter over to introduce her. His daughter felt that
Hunt was a man very pleased with himself. Jessup had no other
recollections.

pee


7. Mr. Broe (then Chief, WH Division) has no recollection of any

: mame traces handled for Hunt other than the one forwarded over his
(Broe's) name on 13-December 1971. He recalls discussing that with
his deputy, Jim Flannery, He has discussed this with Flannery, who

. has. checked the records of WH and has found no other such records.
At this time it. seems unlikely that we will answer the questions this

“ presents. -Was. Hunt's out-of-channel request (which WH put back in
channel) the one Jessup recalls, with embellishments? Or did Hunt
make additional requests; through channels, that were not serviced?

ie We have the one recorded name trace, on a Costa Rican, and-no others.

L On'8 December 1971 Mr. Howard Hunt requested a CIA employee
known to him personally, Miss Elizabeth McIntosh, to assist in a name

National Security Council, from the Chief, WH Division. Gonzalez was
reported to be a millionaire, with various holdings in Costa Rica, and an.
unidentified connection with IBM. He had lived in the U.S. for a number
of years and seems to have formed his party in December 1971.

2. The genesis of the requested name trace is not known, and
