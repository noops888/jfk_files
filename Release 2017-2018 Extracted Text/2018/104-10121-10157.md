MEMORANDUM FOR: CHIEF OF seouraty Q/”
SUBJECT: Mrs, David Morales
——

1. Mrs. Morales called the office at 1130 on the above date to
inquire if any mail had been received from her husband and to advise
that $67.50 had been deposited to her account so she would not be able
to repay the $400 advance at this time, I advised her that there was
not any mail and that the $400 had already been deducted from her
deposit, thus the low sum of $67.50.

2. She then asked if she could heve Bill's number as she had

mislaid it. As I was looking it up 4 very definite click was heard
over the telephone as if someone had lifted the extension phone, I
asked her if there was anyone at her house to which she replied no.
I then checked the extension on my phone but there was no one on that
phone, When I returned to my phone I asked Mrs, Morales if she was on
@ party line to which she replied that she was not but there was still
someone on the line so perhaps I should call back later. I told her I
would,

3. Since I will not be ih the office this afternoon to receive
instructions from you, I will call her from an outside phone and tell
her not to call the office again unless she receives further instructions
to the contrary. I will advise her of Rip's number but tell her not
to give her last name when making a call,
