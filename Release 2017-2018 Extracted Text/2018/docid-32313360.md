The numbers writers normally pay a minor amount for

protection to the "beat"

officers which usually consists of a

bottle of whiskey now and then or similar small gifts and is for

their own personal protection.

The gambling "backers" having writers working in the

various precincts must deal with one or more of the detectives

assigned to that precinct and in many instances must deal

directly with the Captain of the particular precinct.

If the

gambler operates his office anywhere in the District of columbia

he must further pay one of the

"bag men" who work out of the

Metropolitan Police Department Headquarters.

HINKLE worked in the William "Snags" Lewis Numbers

Organization tor about three

and one half years prior to 1951.

He was a sub-control man and handled the Alexandria, "controla,

area for _JOHN RALPH "Billy! MITCHELL who was then a

nan" for LEWISTLE also worked in the numbers office of bl

He also paid for his own protection, that is

the operations which he personally handled.

MICHELL paid BOBBY"

nones of the Alexandria, virginia,

Police Department $300 per month for protection. He also paid

approximately $1700 per month to the Metropolitan Police Depart-

ment for protection of his own operations which he operated in

Washington, D. C. He paid over $2000 per month during this

period of time to Metropolitan police officers in behalf of "SNAGS"

LEWIS.

HINKLE was a close associate and personal friend of

MITCHELL prior to the time he went to the Maryland House of

Corrections in 1951 as a result of a gambling raid on LEWIS's

organization in 1949.

He noted that

there was a considerable

delay between the time of his charge and imprisonment due to

various appeals.

He often went with MITCHELL when pay-offs were made

and personally witnessed pay-offs to the following Metropolitan

Police Department officials:

in Washington,

D. C., was handled in numbers offices in Virginia.

This office was located in the territory of the Number three

precinct at 23rd and I Streets, NW, Washington, D. C. It was

located over a small independent drug store, name presently

unrecalied.

Prior to opening this office LANCHORNE RORER made

arrangements for HINKLE to meet to with WARD OULks of the

Metropolitan vice

Squad. FOULKS was assigned at the Metropolitan

Police Department Headquarters as opposed to the precinct

headquarters.

An agreement was reached whereby HINKLE would

pay FOULKS $300 per month.

This was the minimum amount that

a gambler can pay if he wants to operate a gambling office in

washington;

This price allowed HINKLE to operate anywhere

In Washington, D. C., except one precinct presently unrecalled.

Prior to the actual start of this operation in

Washington, D. C., it was necessary to tell FOULKS where the

office would be located and the telephone number at this office.

This was necessary so that the police department could check

and determine if it was likely that there would be trouble

in the vicinity and also so that the backer could be warned

if necessary.,

HINKLE stated that as long as there was no trouble

one could stay in the same office almost indefinitely.

He

stated that in his case he never had any trouble while

working there as he paid the stipulated amount.

He worked

there for a few months only as he had other offices in

Arlington, Virginia, which he used most of the time.

HINKLE stated that he was not able to discontinue

his payments to FOULKS until he had definitely quit backing

the

numbers during January of 1962.

He continued to pay FOULKS

even after this official received an inter-department transfer.

After being transferred to the squad on which he is probably now

working and away from the squad where he would have direct contact

with gambling investigations, FOULKS told HINKLE that he was

then collecting for HEMPTON MOYER, the head of the gambling squad

and that his protection

would be the same.

WARD FOULKS is in a position to check automobile license

for various gambling figures when they believe they are being

survelled by various investigating officers. HINKLE is of the

opinion that this includes cars of the FBI.

During the first of the year, 1962, FOULKS called

HINKLE via telephone and told him that

the FBI would probably be

surveilling him and thereafter gave HINKLE

about seven or eight

license numbers which he stated might be used on automobiles

in this surveillance work.

These numbers were all either

Washington, D. C., or Maryland license plates.
