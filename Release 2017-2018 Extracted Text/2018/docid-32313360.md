The numbers writers normally pay d minor amount for
- rotection to the "beat" officers which usually consists of a
- lpottle of whiskey now and then or similar small gifts and is for
their own, personal protection.
fase

The gambling "backers" having writers working in the
various precincts must deal with one or more of the detectives
assigned to that precinct and in many instances must deal
directly with the Captain of the particular precinct. If the

ambler operates his office anywhere in the District of Columbia
@ must further pay one of the "bag men" who work out of the’ é

"control man* in the; vicinity of First and H Streets, NE, for
many years. This is within the Metropolitan Police Department

$350 per month and was paid by HINKLE in cash. Sometimes
"FLUFFY " would take care of the actual payment.

During the Summer of 1959 (FNU) MC CARTHY was
transferred or for some other unrecalled reason could not
continue acting as "bag man", MC CARTHY thereafter made
arrangements for Sgt. MARK GRAY of the Robbery Squad to take
over as the "bag man",

HINKLE then started paying GRAY $350 a month for

done at a gambling office operated by HINKLE on Glebe Road in
Arlington, Virginia. This office was raided by the Arlington :
County Police Department in February of 1960. "BERNIE" was i
arrested during this raid and HINKLE shortly thereafter stopped
handling the business of ROY MILES, (HINKLE had been tipped off |
concerning this raid by the Arlington Police Department but 7
allowed "BERNIE" to be arrested as he thought inesaltcel was
stealing from him.)

HINKLE ‘continued paying the $200 per month to DE MILT
until he quit the numbers business during January of 1962.

After MARK GRAY discontinued acting as "bag man"
HINKLE did not have any work in the Number two precinct as he
had let ROY MILES work go at approximately the same time.
Therefore he did not have to make any further payments in that
precinct. He continued to pay for protection in precinct number
one, however, at the rate of $100 per month. This amount was paid
oy "FLUFFY" for HINKLE to JOHN CLINE, identified above as the
Officer in Charge of Detectives in the Number one precinct.
These payments continued until January of 1962 when HINKLE quit
the numbers business completely. a
Frio To :

During the Su er. of 1960 HINKLE opened a numbers office
in Washington, D. C. - that time the work which he had
in Washington, D. C., was handled in numbers offices in Virginia.
This, office was located in the territory of the Number three
precinct at 23rd and L Streets, NW, Washington, D., C. It was
located over a small independent drug store, name presently
unrecalied.

Prior to opening this office LANCEO RORER made
arrangements for HINKLE to meet to with, WAI Bee of the
ce Squad. FOULKS was ass che Metropolitan
~ Headquarters as opposed to ‘the precinct ——~——~--~

headquarters “An agreement was reached whereby HINKLE would
pay FOULKS $300 per month. ‘This was the minimum amount that

a gambler can pay if he wants to operate a gambling office in
Washington, D. C. ‘This price allowed HINKLE to operate anywhere
in Washington, Do

. C., except one precinct presently unrecalled,

Prior to the actual start of this operation in
Washington, D. C., it was necessary to tell FOULKS where the
office would be located and the telephone number at this office.
This was necessary so that the police department could check”
and determine if it was likely that there would be trouble
in the vicinity and also so that the backer could be warned
if necessary.

HINKLE stated that as long as there was no trouble
one could stay in the same office almost indefinitely. He
stated that in his case he never had any trouble while
working there as he paid the stipulated amount. He worked
there for a few months only as he had other offices in ~
Arlington, Virginia, which he used most of the time,

HINKLE stated that he was not able to discontinue
his payments to FOULKS until he had definitely quit backing the
numbers during January of 1962, He continued to pay FOULKS
even after this official received an inter-department transfer.
After being transferred to the squad on which he is probably now
working and away from the squad where he would have direct contact
with gambling investigations, FOULKS told HINKLE that he was

then collecting for MOYER, the head of the gambling squad
and that his aetna would be the same. y

ment.

Gambling Squad.

Police Department, Arlington, Virginia, are close personal
friends.

WARD FOULKS is in a position to check automobile license
for various gambling figures when they believe they are being
surveilled by various investigating officers. HINKLE is of the
opinion that this includes cars of the FBI.

HINKLE via telephone and told him that the FBI would probably be
surveilling him and thereafter gave HINKLE about seven or eight
license numbers which he stated might be used on automobiles

in this surveillance work. ‘These numbers were all. either
