MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Meeting with Mr. Herbert Manell )

1. Yesterday afternoon I met with Mr. @faneID in the
company of Messrs. Shepanek and Holmes. The purpose of the
meeting was to ascertain Mr. (ManelI'’S recollection of cer-
tain events in Mexico City in connection with the visit of
Lee Harvey Oswald there. I told Mr. Maneli>the question
that. had arisen over the memoires of Win Scott.

2. While Mr. M@anell/has not read the Scott memoires,
he said that he could offer speculation on, how Scott came
to write such a thing. Mr. Scott at times was "prone to
exaggeration." Manel said that Oswald's visit came at
the end of the summer. The summer was a periad when lots
of "kooks" came to Mexico and contacted the Soviet Embassy.

said that this proved to be very time consuming
from the Station's point of view as the Station was obliged
to report to Headquarters and appropriate Embassy components
on these people when they were identified. He considered
this function to be one of "no profit" operationally,
although it was of course a necessary CI responsibility.

3. When Oswald identified himself in a telephone call
to the Soviets it was viewed-by Manell>as being a meaning-
less instance of one more probable useless contact to
report; for the Station had no record or file on Oswald.

Cienela id wife, a part-time employee, ended up writing a
cable. No one thought much of Oswald, and Win Scott signed
off on the cable without question.

4. On the question of photographic coverage he said
there is a practical explanation of why there were no
photographs of Oswald. He said the work was very boring.
He believes that the Mexicans were simply not photographing



everyone. He is categorical in saying that neither he nor
his wife ever saw a:photograph of Lee Oswald. While neither
he nor his wife reviewed all the photography (a responsibility
of Anne Goodpasture) he would have seen it had it existed.
He feels that Oswald's appearance was so distinctive that
it would have made an impression on him. He said that in
his meetings with the HSCA he had told them. his personal
convictions, which he still holds, that there was "no
conspiracy at the Station." He worked the Soviet target
and would more than likely have seen all pictures. In sum,
: (Manell~and wife are convinced that the Station had no
photographs of Oswald; and that the Mexi¢gan photo LP
operators are probably alone responsible for not having
taken pictures of Oswald's entries or exists of the Soviet
Embassy.

5. Following the assassination of President Kennedy,
(Manelb recalls a number of Agency personnel listening to
radio broadcasts. When the name of Oswald occurred, his
first reaction was, 'My God, that's the man I reported on."
Someone else may have responded similarly but he recalls
that as his reaction. This led to a cable to Headquarters.

6. Speaking in a rather all-inclusive way he said
that there were no photographs of Oswald there then, so
there were none to burn or destroy afterwards.

7. WfaneTIy mentioned the fact that the HSCA people
pressed him on why Tom Karamessines had signed off on a
communication for a name trace. He could not understand
it. Holmes told him that the Division Chief had signed
the cable, which required the next highest person's
release. (ManeIIjclearly had not thought of that, and in
our discussion we observed that the HSCA investigators
were asking him (in the field at the time) what had
happened at Headquarters at the time.

8. He repeated that there was no conspiracy and he
told the HSCA people that they were "barking up the wrong
tree." Qlaneli>said that at the time he testified he did
not know about the statement in Win Scott's memoire so
there was no occasion to comment on it.

9. Mr.C@aneli>said that he would speak with his
wife to see if she had anything to add to what he stated


14-00000

above. He reported later that his wife had nothing addi-
tional to offer. I told him that I would prepare a draft
memo of the conversation and show it to him before putting
it into final form, which was done.
