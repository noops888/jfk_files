At 4:15 p.m. on February 7, 1964 captioned individual called

at IOs and was referred to me.

Mr. Jacobs advised that Mrs. Marina

Oswald, the widow of lee Harvey Osweld, alleged assassin of

President John F. Kennedy, was expected for dinner at their home

that evening.

Mr. Jacobs stated that shortly after the assassination, his

wile, who is fluent in the Russian language, wrote a letter

Mrs. Oswald sympathizing with her plight and assuring her that

the crime of her husband would not be visited upon her and her

children.

Jacobs stated that his wife had never heard of

Marina Oswald before this event and wrote the letter purely

as a humanitarian gesture.

She was somewhat surprised when

about Christmas of 1963 she received a rather lengthy letter

of thanks from Mrs. Oswald which revealed that the latter had

a deeply religious formation.

Mrs. Jacobs replied to this letter and as a further gesture,

invited Mrs. Oswald to visit her any time

she happened to be in

the Washington, D. C. area. On February 6, 1964 Mrs. Jacobs

received a telephone call from Mrs. Oswald who said that she

had completed her testimony before the Warren Commission and

that she would be willing to accept Mrs. Jacobs' invitation

for dinner that evening at their home.

Since other commitments

precluded getting together on that evening, a date was set up

for February 7, 1964. Mr. Jacobs added that Mrs. Oswald told

his wife it would be necessary for her to bring along her

attorney and "her agent." He interpreted the latter to describe

an individual who was looking out for her personal affairs.

stated that he was at that moment on his way to get Mrs. Oswald

at that no one.

He

and bring her to the Jacobs' home.

I told Mr. Jacobs that I appreciated his bringing this

information to our attention but that it would not be necessary

to obtain "clearance" from this office. I told him that by all

accounts Mrs. Oswald was in this country legally and had cooperated

entirely with the Government in its inquiries subsequent to the

assassination of the President. In the absense of any information

to the contrary there would appear to be no security consequence

but in view of the public relations aspect he should be certain

that his supervisors be fully aware of what he was doing. He

On March 11, 1964 Mr. Mileski brought Special Agent Charles

Taylor of the Secret Service in to see me. He intimated that

Mr. Taylor was conducting an inquiry on Mrs. Oswald's activities

and associates and was attempting to develop information regarding

the Jacobses in view of their invitation to Mrs. Oswald to "live

with them." Mr. Mileski made available our file on Jacobs and

I advised Mr. Taylor orally in accordance with the facts as

indicated in this memorandum. In the meantime, Mr. Mileski

indicated that his Division would attempt to develop further

information concerning Mrs. Jacobs since there is no documentatio

in our file regarding her
