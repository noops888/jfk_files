1. In addition to the ordinary telephone system in Havana, there is
a government telephone system which uses the exchange name PIZARRA,
connecting all offices of government organizations and government-
sponsored enterprises, Each government office or enterprise has
at least ont PIZARRA telephos? which is distinct from the regular
telephone system, In the Direzcion General de Inteligencia
{General Directorate of Int=lligence - DGI) Headquarters, there
is a PIZARRA telephone controlled by Manuel PINEIRO Losada's
secretary, "Vidalina", who works in building. If any member
of the DGI wishes to call anyone on sensitive business through
the PIZARRA exchange, he may either state his requirements to
Vidalina, who will make the call for him and report the informa-
tion back when she kas acquired it, or go to "MN" building and
make the call himself on the PIZARRA telephone. With the exception
of PINEIRO's residence and éffice, where he has his own PIZARRA
telephone, uo other DGI office has a PIZARRA telephone. There is
no directory for PIZARRA numbers ard it is not a dial system, but
works through a central switchboard with operators; it is con-
sidered secure. The caller picks ‘up the telephone and gets an
operator on the central PIZARRA switchboard; the caller asks for

the office to which'he wishes to speak, and, if he knows, asks for
the person to whem h to speak. A DGI officer whose office

Liberation Department - LN), outside the "M" building headquarters,
for example, there are six telephones, From these telephones one
dials any number in the telephone directory, private or a govern-
ment office number, direct, For internal calls within the DGI,
