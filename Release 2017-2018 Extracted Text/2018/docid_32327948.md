with him at his convenience.

Without any endeavor to ascertain

the purpose of the interview, GARBER immediately proceeded to

proffer numerous excuses to avoid any interview.

However, he

finally agreed to appear at the NYO during the afternoon of

5/27/63. GARBER did not appear at the NYO and failed to call to

offer any reason for his non-appearance.

It may be noted that several attempts were made to con-

tact GARBER at his residence during the month of May, 1963. On

each occasion, GARBER was absent from his residence and his wife

was unable to furnish any information concerning his whereabouts

or itinerary.

Since ABRAHAM ZOSLOVSKY and AARON KLEIMAN have been

interviewed relative to the subject's interest in A Corner of

Hawail, the interview with GARBER is temporarily being held in

abeyance in an endeavor to develop additional information concern-

ing his association with the subject.

displayed a friendly attitude and Invited the PCI to step into

another office, where they could have f

a private conversation.

At the outset off the conversation, GRANELLO apologized

for the conduct of GEORGE

LEVINE, in the latter's relationship

with the PCi several yearsiago.

He stated that LEVINE was

corrected for his actions, at that time, and described LEVINE

as "crazy".

GRANELLO then proceeded to advise the PCI that he and

LEVINE were both in trouble with the Federal Government.

added that he was not concerned relative to his own problems,

since they only involved money and if worse came to worse, he

would simply have to pay a fine, but not go to jail. He lurcher

stated that the people behind him would not let him go to jail.

However, he stated that LEVINE's situation presented a different

problem. He commented that LEVINE is under a sentence of 22z years

but he, GRANELLO, does not intend to see LEVINE serve any time.

At this point, he asked the PCI if the latter would be willing

or

felt obligated to furnish $7500.00 for LEVINE's appeal. The PCI

stated that he does not have the money and did not feel any moral

obligation to furnish such money.

GRANELLO proceeded to inquire relative to the current

status of JOHN

KEILLY, who was associated with GRANELLO, LEVINE

and the PCI in the past.

The PCI told GRANELLO that he has not

had any contact with KEILLY and is not cognizant of his present

financial status.

The subject asked the PCI if the latter would

be willing to check into KEILLY's current status and see if he

would have any money available for LEVINE's appeal..

He stated

the PCI that GRAZIANO could furnish the PCI with KEILLY's

current business card and suggested that the PCI get in touch with

KEILLY.

The PCI stated that GRANELLO did not make any direct

threats such as he received from LEVINE in the past. However,

he stated that there were a couple of veiled threats made by

GRANELLO. In one instance, GRANELLO stated that the only way his

people are separated from money is by death.

The PCI explained

that this meant either GRANELLO or his associates would resort

to murder as a means to acquire money, or that they would have to

be killed to prevent them from such actions.

The PCI also stated

He added that FRANKIE (LNU) arranges dates for a number of girls

that frequent the establishments.

GRALIANO lurther told the pel that one, HARVEY GREEN,

a cookie distributor, had recently run into difficulty with the

Teamsters Union.

After contacting GRANELLO, Felative to the

situation, GRANELLO called ANTHONY "Tony PrOW PROVENZANO In NJ

and had the situation with GREEN straightened out: According to

GRAZIANO, GREEN has not had any problems since

'that time.

The aforementioned information was withheld from the

details of instant report, since the PCI has indicated on several

occasions that GRANELLO and his associates are suspect of the PCI's

activities.

Since most of this information was furnished directly

to the PCI by GRANELLO, it is felt that the unnecessary disclosure

of this information may tend to compromise this informant.

During My and June, 1963, NY 3936-C furnished the

following information to SA WILLIAM A. VERICKER:

The informant advised that SAL GRANELLO also known as

residing in Brazil and skipped with $175,000.00 of GRANELLO'S ASA

money, although he, GRANELLO, Claims that he presently sends BIRELI

$300:00 per month for living expenses.

GRANELLO further stated

that he owns A Corner of Hawall Bar and Restaurant at lith St. and

Sth, Ave., NYC. GRANELLO was also associated with TOM MARINO,

GRECO, the manager of the playboy club in NyC.

SALLY BURNS claims an' interest in the Marlborough House

project in Miami, Florida, and that he put $100,000.00 into this

operation with SIDNEY MOSS and LARRY HOLLANDER.
