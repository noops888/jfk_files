MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
FROM : John H. Waller ~
inspector General
SUBJECT : Mr. George de Mohrenschildt
REFERENCE : Mr. de Mohrenschiidt's letter to you,

dated 5 September 1976

Action Required:

1. None. This memorandum is for your information. We have also
attached at’A a suggested draft reply to Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter.

Action Taken:

2. We have reviewed DDO and IG files on Mr. de Mohrenschildt: In
addition, at our request, the CI Staff has run Agency traces on him and
has been in touch with the FBI as well.

Findings:

3, There is voluminous material on Nr. de Mohrenschildt in’ CIA
files, most of it dating from the post-Kennédy assassination period
when he testified before the Warren Conmission on his acquaintance
with Mir. and Hrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. (A copy of the de Nohrenschildts*
testimony is attached at B.)

4. The bulk of the material in our files consists of FBI. reports,
the most recent of which is dated 1967. The FBI has informed CIA that
it has.no traces on Mr. de Nohrenschildt beyond that date; our files -
contain all of its previous material on him.

5. Mr. Helms' 3 dune 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on
the de Mohrenschiidts is attached at C. it describes the Agency's
interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt-in 1957 as a
result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year. Contact Division (now
Domestic Coliection Division - DCD) had its resident agent in Dallas,
Mr. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. The
history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de Mohrenschildt from 1957
to 1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested
traces.on Mr. de Mohrenschildt. The trace results (attached at D) con-
tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive
contact with the de Mohrenschildts. (An OS summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt
prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

6. Our files show that a mail cover was ‘placed on letters addressed
to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to
1966: - (This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-
vestigations. ) _This included opening and photographing the contents of
some letters dby- the €IA’Station) there. The results of this operation
were shared with the FBI.

7. Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during
the Rockefeller Commission investigations. We were asked to respond to a
memorandum submitted to the. Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled “CIA
Activities. and the Warren Commission Investigation." Mr. Hoch called for
an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and
asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de
Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is
attached at E. :

8. The most recent information we have on Mr. de Mohrenschildt comes
from Mr.-J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers
connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell
Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and
Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mr. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached
at F.

Conciusions:

9. Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have Tead an adventurous and
colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman. He is both weil

and poorly connected, and some of his associations in the past have
raised serious questions. Certainly his relationship with the
Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this
Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy on him in the past
than was necessary.

10. Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their
interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late
1960's.. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could
either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-
tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the ‘assassination
of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond
Mr. Moore's reports attached at F. What we can say’ is that we have
found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active
interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.

Dear George:

Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.
It took time to explore thoroughly the matters you raised.

Let me say first that I know it must have been. difficult for you
to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I
can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic
death a few years ago and the current poor state of your wife's health.
I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances.

In your situation, I can-well imagine how the attentions you
described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my
staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your
activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. The
flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren
Commission has Tong since subsided. I can only speculate that you
may have become “newsworthy” again in view of the renewed interest
‘in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may be attracting the atten-
tion of people in the media.

I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George,
although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.
Thank you for your good wishes on my new job. As you can iimagine,
I'm finding it interesting and challenging.

Very truly a >

At this tims I saw and not Hrs. Jan de Nohrenschildt, a white Russian
eaigres fron Shanghai. I saw the do Mohrenschilat's several times in 2953
and 1959. In late 1959 or early 1960, Hr. and Urs. da Hohrenschildt went
on an 18 sionth biking trip through élexicd and Central America. An account
of this trip, as taken fron the 18 Oct 61 issue of the Dallas Times Herald,
is enclosed.

4, In tha way of a personal assessaent, I would say that tha
de Nohrenschildt's are an interesting and unusual couple. This is, I
baliove, the second marriage for both of thes. Mrs. de Mohrenschildt,
who has been a successful dress designar, hes a grovn,narried daughter,
who is quite a fine artiat.. Georga de Hohrenschildt has several children
hy his first vite (reportedly a very wealthy woman now Miying in the
Hiddle East}, One of his children died of cystic fibrosis and George
de Pohrenschildt has always heen very active in the yearly cystic fibrosis
fund raising campaign.

5. George de Hohrenschildt makes a good appearance. He ip.
bout six feet tall end weighe arcund 190 pounds, For a man his age,
approximately 53, he keeps binsalf in good. condition and is a bit of a
physical fitness nut. He {s.a moderate drinker and when I last aa%

im, snoked a pipe. TI would describe his porsonality aa filendly and out~
going although I have hoard his refarred to as conceited. He reputedly ..
has an eys for the ladies and I understand hia interest dods not go
unreciprocatad. He leads a scaawhat unconventional life, plays temis
at § olclosk fn the morning, ha is rather outspoken, has a keen interest
in international affairs ard in sosial justice, By local conservative
standards, he would be considered a Liberal. His outlook on lifo is
contineatal.

6. De Hohrenschildt is fairly well known in petroleva circles.
S\Kp Pallas. I only know of one good friend of bis, This is(Col,) Lawtence  -"-
*oslov (Retired) who is in the off leasing businass. The colonel and I ?
-- both play handball. He mentioned the last tine I sew hin that de Kobron-
schildt wanted his to come to Haiti to kelp him run a plantation and

Subject was investigated by Federal Agencies in 191, 1912,
1945, 19:7, and 1957. The investigation reports as well as the
files of other Federal. Agencies reflect the following:

Between 190 and 192 Subject was considered to be
pro-Gernan.and suspected of being a Cerman propagandist and
an espionage agent.

Several informants stated that Subject was in sympathy
with the Commmist form of government in Russia but Inew-of no
un-American activities on the part of Subject. Ono informant
advised in 197 that Subject had definite Commnistic tenden~
cies.

Investigations failed to produce any legal competent
evidence or witnesses to substantiate the reports that Subject
had been proComunist or pro-Nazi.

Majority of informants consider Subject to be eccentric,
irresponsible, conceited, an adventurer fond of exaggeration, and
overly aggressive.

Subject has been Imown to associate with’ persons of ~~
questionable loyalty, reputation, and moral character.

Gubject, when interviewed, admitted that he tends to exag~
gerate and advised that he thought the Communist form of govern~
ment of Soviet Russia was the better form of government on the -
European continent, and thet he had a great admiration for the
Communistic form of government, but that that did not prevent +

George DE MOHRENSCHILDT

From the Office of Security

CIA CONNECTION:

DE MOHRENSCHILDT was security disapproved for OSS employ-
ment on 18 July 1942 because he was suspected of being a Nazi
agent. On 13 August 1958 derogatory information was furnished
the Contact Office who was interested in interrogating him as
an alien contact. His second wife, Phyllis whom he married on
11 July 1948.and divorced 29 December 1949, was employed as a
receptionist by a covert project (NCFE) from 1950 to 12 January
1951 when her employment was terminated. (Reason not given.)

Subject's brother, Dimitri S. VON MOHRENSCHILDT, was
approved on 11 April 1950 for exploitation as.a contact for
foreign intelligence purposes on a limited baSis; not to receive
classified information above confidential.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

OS Files on Subject, his second wife, and his brother
reflect use by the Agency as set out above. Subject was
investigated by the FBI in 1941, 1942, 1945, 1947 and 1957.
Between 1940 and 1942 Subject was considered to be pro-German
and suspected of being a German propagandist and an espionage.
agent. Several informants stated-that Subject was in sympathy
with the Communist form of government in Russia but knew of
no un-American activities on the part of Subject.. One infor-
mant advised in 1947 that Subject had definite Communistic
tendencies. However, investigations failed to produce any
legal competent evidence or witnesses to substantiate the
reports that Subject had been pro-Communist or pro-Nazi. |The
majority of informants’ consider Subject to-be eccentric,
irresponsibie, conceited, an adventurer fond of exaggeration
and overly aggressive. He has been known to associate with
persons of questionable loyalty, reputation and moral character.
Subject has admitted that he tends to exaggerate and stated
that he thought the Communist form of government of Soviet -
Russia was the better form of government on the European

continent; that he had a great admiration for the Communist
form of government but that this admiration did not prevent him
from having a stronger feeling of loyalty to the government of
the United States.

A New York Times item for 12 December 1966 mentioned that
George DE MOHRENSCHILDT has been acquainted with Jacqueline
KENNEDY's father, John BOUVIER, and mother, Mrs. Hugh AUCHIN-
CLOSS, since Mrs. KENNEDY was a girl. The DE MOHRENSCHILDT's
were quoted as saying they were perhaps the only persons in
the world to have known the families of both- President KENNEDY
and OSWALD. :

Was J. Walton Moore connected with CIA? Was he connected

with the Oswald case? .

Answer:
Mx. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division
office in Pallas during the early 1960's. His only contact
with the Oswald ‘case prior to the assassination is recorded in
his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact
Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed version of the document

is also attached because. of the poor legibility of the >:
original). We may have been involved in the Agency's effort to
support the Warren Commission during the Commission's investi-
gations. Mr. Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr.
de Mohrenschildt for advice concerning Oswald. We find no
indication that there was ever any contact between Oswald and

Mr. Moore.

1. On the evening of 13 July 1976, at about 2100, Mr. Richard
Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by
my house. .He advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy
assassination and that ke understood I was a friend of George
deHohrenschildt. He wanted to know if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald
or if deMohrenschildt. had ever suggested that I should see Oswald.
I told him no on both counts and advised that.I have not seen or
talked with George deHohrenschildt since the fall of 1961.

2. Mr. Russell attempted to draw me into discussion of the
Kennedy assassination which I avoided and wanted to know if I could
give him the name of the chief of the CIA office in Mexico City in
1963. I told him I could not, and he said he could probably get the
name from Hr. David Phillips. I do not foresee any adverse publicity
as a result of Mr. Russell's visit. but felt that it should be ox a
matter of record.

1. On 19 May 1976, Pom/Butler, a research writer for Redder's Digest,
called on the listed line. She identified herself as being wir the
Reader's Digest and said she was doing research for a book being written
by Harry ‘Epstein on the Kennedy assassination, Ste asked if I had ever
talked to or met Lee Harvey Oswald. .I told her I had not. She then asked
if I had talked to George deMiohrenschildt. about Lee Harvey Oswald. After
I told her that I would not discuss the matter, she said that she under~
stood from deMolirenschildt that I had talked to him after he had retumed
from a trip to Yugoslavia. I neither confirmed nor denied this, and I told
her again J, would not discuss the subject.

2, Ido not know if Ms, Butler actually talked to. deMohrenschildt
or not since the information she had could have been acquixed from the
Warren Commission Report.

I do know this man DeMohrenschildt...

I first men him in the early 40'3. He was
an uncle to my Andover roommate.- ~~ -

Later he surfaced in Dallas- (50's maybe)

He got involved in some controversial
dealings in Haiti.

Then he surfaced when Oswald shot to
prominence. He knew Oswald before the.
assassination of Pres. Kennedy.

+1 don't recall his. role in all this.

At. one time he had /or spent plenty of
money.

I have not heard from him for many years until
the attached letter came, in.
