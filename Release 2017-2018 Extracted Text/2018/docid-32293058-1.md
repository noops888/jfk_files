CARLOS

MARCELLO

ANTI-RACKETEERING

PCI JOSEPH HEGEMAN advised SA VINCENT K. ANTLE

as follows on 6/15/61:

On Sunday, 6/11/61, at Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

in an automobile, PCI HEGEMAN heard from a source close

to the Governor of Louisiana (the identity of which source

he did not wish to reveal) that certain persons were intent

on getting

help for CARLOS MARCELLO to obtain a 6-month

delay at his INS deportation hearing scheduled for 6/27 or

6/28/61, at McAllen, Texas.

The source asked PCI HEGEMAN if

he could assist on this matter through his political con-

tacts.

PCI HEGEMAN was told that $100,000 was available

in cash to secure the successful results in this deal, and

that HEGEMAN could have $50,000 cash at once with the

remainder of $50,000 to be held back until the deal was

completely consummated.

The source old POI ABEENAN they

move was going to be made and the money paid to help

MARCELLO get this delay whether he, HEGEMAN, was interested

or not.

The source told HEGEMAN that MARCELLO had paid

$400,000

to the recent National Democratic Campaign and*

$300,000 to the successful campaign of DAVIS, present

Governor of Louisiana.

The source said Governor DAVIS had

close in the past, and he would be interested in helping

MARCELLO get this 6-month delay. The source said RUSSELL

LONG, U. S. Senator from Louisiana, would be interested in

ince sued in

assisting MARCELLO since in the past he, too, has received

financial aid from MARCELLO. The source said LONG had

recommended and was sponsoring a Louisiana official for the

top INS position in Washington, D. C., and if he could get

this official appointed, he then could help MARCELLO through

this appointment.

The source indicated to PCI HEGEMAN that

the FBI was investigating this Louisiana candidate for the

INS position. The source said MARCELLO has in excess of

30 million collars in cash, and that he controls politics

in Louisiana.

PCI HEGEMAN said CARLOS MARCELLO and his close

contacts and friends will secure a complete run-down on

the commissioner who will preside at the INS hearing in

McAllen, Texas,

and an approach will be made directly or

indirectly to him financially to delay the deportation in

accordance with MARCELLO's wishes. PCI HEGEMAN said he

knew of no further details concerning the methods to be

used by MARCELLO or his contacts, but that they would

concentrate on the weaknesses of the commissioner obtained

from a result of their investigation of him. PCI HEGEMAN

felt overtures in this direction would be made in the

immediate future.

PCI HEGEMAN said MARCELLO desires a 6-month

delay because he and his lawyers feel they can whip his

deportation permanently if granted this period to do it.

PCI HEGEMAN said he has no use whatsoever for

CARLOS MARCELLO and felt the U. S. should rid itself of

such hoodlums, and that is why he wished to furnish this

information.

He said that he told the source he would

not be a part to help MARCELLO because the deal would not

be a public relations matter which is his business but a

fix, and that his present reputable promotional venture

is a successful one, and that he did not wish to hurt:

his reputation or the reputation of his present business

through the suggested implication.

An original FD-302 has been prepared, initialed

and recorded in the file of PCI JOSEPH HEGEMAN

at Miami,

in the event it is necessary to have same at a later date.

Enclosed is a letterhead memo suitable for

dissemination to INS by the Bureau. Also enclosed is

one copy each for New Orleans and

San Antonio for their

information.
