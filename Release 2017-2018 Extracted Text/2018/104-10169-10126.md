Preliminary Survey:

Due to the inadequacy of the submitted material, only tentative
summarising statements can be made.

Summarizing Statements:

‘The writer is evidently a.reserved and careful person who
attende to his affairs in a rather deliberate manner. He p:
good intelligence (not brillant), is well educated and professionally
trained. He has thoroughly absorbed the material he has read and
studied and knows how to utilise it ina purposeful manner. His way:

of thinking is clear, logical and fairly adaptable. He apparently is

anxious to learn new things and.to wid:
intellectual ambitions, but the emphasis of his interests is in the
practical ephere. He does not pos: much originality, but he
identifies himself with well-selected patterne which may let him
appear more sophisitcated than he actually is. He discards unneces~
@ary and superfluous material, but he may not discern the vital pointe
in more intricate and unfamiliar problems unless properly pointed out
to him. He is a careful observer of small details which he correlates
properly to their larger aspect within his familiar frame of reference.
He combines a certain amount of imagination with sober-mindedness
and matter-of-factness. He tries to expedite his work, but he is not
likely to sacrifice accuracy to expediency. His critical faculties are
well developed and he evaluates by rather set standards. Also, he
4s not likely to voice his criticism openly as he tends to avoid open
controversies, Within the area of his knowledge and experience, he
ean exercise initiative and deal with the overall picture of a project.
He has some understanding for mechanical functioning which may not
be fully trained and expluited, He can figure and calculate and he has
earned to think in larger texms and transactions. He is conservative
in his calculations and he will make every possible effort to get along
with the money and material at his disposal. Secretely, he would like to
pend money freely and play the role of a big shot. He has some
administrative abilities which he can exercise within a limited familiar
area, In relation to this, he can work out the blueprint of a plan and
supervise ite proper axecution,. He is neat and orderly and he likes to
arrange evorything in a propor manner. He can take orders, follow

a his horizon. He has some

prescribed rules and regulations and he will take care that people who
work for him do the.same. In the execution of his tasks, he is exact,
conscientious and reliable. He is serious, methodical and systematic
in his approach, He can express himself in an adequate form, verbally
as well as in writing. He is able to present his material in a concise
and understandable manner, He is not likely to say one word more
than would be absolutely necessary, which is one of his customary
precautions. He is a diligent worker who pursues his aims persist-
ently and who does nxt rest until the last item of an assignment-is

_ Completed, When necessary, he can muster a considerable amount

of patience. His analyzing and synthesizing faculties are not particu
larly pronounced, but he has a way of figuring out the implications of 7
the things he and hears and usually he comes to the correct con-
clusions rather unassuming in his manners, people may, at
times, underestimate his capabilities. He concentrates well on his
work and at the same time, takes in everything that is, going on

., Sreund him and that could be of special interest to him. His memory

- fanctions precisely and he can reproduce easily remembered knowledge ©
and information.

Emotionally, the writer is predominantly an introverted type
who can join required extraverted professional and social activities
‘without much emotional participation. With the aid of his strong
capacity for identification, he blends in with his environment and
ee avoids attracting special attention. While-he is emotionally not very
aie » mature and individualized, he is fairly well equilibrated, composed

and poised. He has his feelings and impulses under the strictest
Fational control and he is not likely to be carried away by them. His
Ego-feelings are much stronger than most people who deal with him
+ would suspect, He is rather confident of himself end inwardly may
i Le even consider himself quite superior to others, There is almost
‘gome impertinence in his inner attitude which helps him to assert
himself and make his claims known in various indirect ways. He is
not quite as harmless as he may appear and he knows exactly what he
is after. He proceeds with great carcfulness and precaution and he

iw quite clever in anticipating poasible dangers, His self-defensive and
.self-protective mechanisms are strongly developed and he is most
secretive about his affairs, He is not likely to confide completely in
anybody. Unncticed, he keupa up a strong personal reserve preventing
ethers from coming too close to him, He is ego-centered and somewhat
; “out ons @liish and he will not.lose sight of his personal advantage in whatever

: : he is doing. He haz developed a colorless and consistent facade which

may serve as a cover for various activities he wants to hide. Whe
considers it necessary, he can be quite versatile and he is able to
make quick changes and switches, In a closer relationship, be can
be rather enigmatic and he may surprise by unexpected actions and
reactions, He ia guided by some ideological system (most likely of
collective nature) with ite fundamental ethical principles which he
follows meticulously on the surface. In reality, he uses a number of
enmouflaging capacities (in a well-calculated and skillful manner) for
professional and social purposes. He is emotionally so detached, that
ig is doubtful if he has any deep-going allegiance, Suggestions in line
with his eelf-centered interests could have a strong appeal for him
and possibly could alter his motivations, At the same time, he should
be very difficult to approach, especially, as he is somewhat unpredic-
table. He is emotionally er strained, but he evidently has sufficient
“strength and energy at present to support his general functioning
adequately. He possesses a rather strong willpower and sufficient
power of resistance to withstand physical as well as emotional pressure,
He apparently has s' led himself in the course of-his life, and he can
become quite numb when he wants to. He is a rather peculiar person
who can te very pursling at times. .

Summ:

‘The writer is a competent and meticulous worker in his prow
fessional field. Behind a harmless front, he is an emotionally complex
and shrewd individual who could very well be involved in some welle
covered-up activities which aré not part of his overt life. He is not
consistent and reliable and one must be prepared for sudden changes in
hhis reaction and action pattern. -
