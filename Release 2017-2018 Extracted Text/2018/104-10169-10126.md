and matter-of-factness. He tries to expedite his work, but he in not

likely to sacrilice accuracy to expediency: His critical faculties are

well doveloped and he evaluates by rather set standarda. Also, he

in not likely to voice his criticiam openly as he tende to avoid open

controversies. Within the area of his knowledge and experience, he

can exercise initiative and deal with the overall picture of a projact.

prescribed rules and regulations and he will take care that people who

work for him do the same. In the execution of his tasks, he is exact,

conscientious and reliable. • He is serious, methodical and syatematic

in his approach. He can express himself in an adequate form, verbally

a well as in writing. He is able to present his material in a concise

and understandable manner. He is not likely to say one word more

precautions. He is a diligent worker who pursues his aims persist

ently and who does n' rest until the last item of an assignment.ia

completed. When necessary, he can mus ter a considerable amount

of patience. His analysing and synthenizing facultien are not particu-

Jarly pronounced, bur he has a way of figuring out the implicationa of

the things he sees and hears and usually he comes to the correct con-

clusions. Being rather unassuming ir his manner, people may, at

times, underestimate his capabilities. He concentrate: well on his

work and at the same time, takes in everything that is going on

around him and that could be of special interest to bim. His memory

functions precinely and he can reproduce easily remembered knowledge

and information.

Emotionally, the writer is predominantly an introverted type

who can join required extraverted professional and social activities

without much emotional participation. With the aid of his strong

capacity for identification, he blends in with his environment and

avoids attracting special attention. While he is emotionally not very

mature and individualised, he is fairly well equilibrated, componed

and poised. He has his feelings and impulses under the strictest

rational control and he is not likely to be carried away by them. His

Ego-feelings are much stronger than most people who deal with bim

would suspect.

He is rather confident of himself and inwardly may

ever consider himself quite superior to others. There is almost

some impertinence in his inner attitude which helps him to assert

himself and make his claims known in various indirect ways. He is

not quite as harmless as he may appear and he knows exactly what he

is after. He proceeds with great carsfulnoss and precaution and he

in quite clever in anticipating possible dangera. Hie self-defensive and

self-protective mechanisms are strongly developed and he is most

cecretive about hie affairs. He is not likely to confide completely in

anybody. Unnoticed, he koops up a strung personal reserve preventing

othere from coming too close to him.

He is ego-centered and somewhat

wolfish and he will not lose sight of his personal advantage in whatever

he du doing.

He has developed a colorless and connistent facade which

may serve an a cover for various activities he wants to hide. Il he

considers it necessary, he can be quite versatile and he is able to

make quick changes and witches. In a closer relationship, he can

be rather enigmatic and he may surprise by unexpected actions and

reactions. He in guided by some ideological system (most likely of

collective nature) with ite fundamental ethical principles which he

follows meticulously on the suriace. In reality, he uses a numbe: of

camouflaging capacities (in a well-calculated and skillful manner) for

professional and social purposes. He in emotionally so detached, that

it 1a doubul 11 he has any deep-going allegiance. Suggestions in line

with his nelf-centered interests could have a strong appeal for him

and posibly could alter his motivations. At the same time, he should

be very difficult to approach, especially, as he in somewhat unpredic

table. He la emotionally rather strained, but he evidently has sufficient

strength and enargy at present to support his general functioning

adequately.

He possesses a rather strong willpower and sufficient

power of remintance to withetand physical as well as emotional pressure.

He apparently has steeled himself in the course of hin life, and he can

become quite numb when he wants to. He is a rather peculiar person

who can to very puisling at times.

Summary:

The writer in a competent and meticulous worker in his pro-

fessional field. Behind a harmles: front, he is an emotionally complex

and shrewd individual who could very well be involved in some well-

covered-up activities which are not part of his overt life. He is not

consistent and reliable and one must be prepared for sudden changes lu

his reaction and action pattern.

Qualification:

This report must be evaluated as qualified information because

the handwriting standards submitted for analysis are not adequate.
