2. Payment was made with reservations, since at the
time of my departure from the JM/AVE area the Finance Officer
estimated chat when wy accountings were reconciled they would

fotlect @ eredit tn my favor of several hundred dollara. There-
re,

I was surprised to find myself in a debtt position when

end so did not exercise
the option,

from Mrs, who had been my Administrative

for jand wished to inform me that in packing she had

Some across a receipt signed by Spencer 0. TERTELING (P) in

the amount of $500 which, she said, she had neglected to tum |
