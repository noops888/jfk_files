$500,00.00 "Jersey" money going to the Deauville Casino.

much money for such an operation, .T-17 explained that the
Deauville had two casinos, one in the lobby which is quite
"plush", but very small, and another downstairs, which is a
cheap casino catering mostly to the "Cuban trade."

expensive inasmuch as it rents rooms for $5.00 or $6.00 a
night, and the hotel itself is not elaborate.
