The following references UKE L in the file dual-
captioned "Julio Aton Constanzo Palau; Gerald Patrick Hemming; et..al;''
set forth conflicting statements concerning the group of trained
Cuban exiles who were recruited during the Summer of 1965 to fight
against the communist elements in the Dominican Republic. JI, Irving
Davidson, who maintained close association with Dominican General
Antonio Imbert Barreras, was reported to be instrumental in organizing
the group and backing the plan financially. The group was reported

to have been formed by Hemming while Constanzo appeared to be a leader
within the group. Davidson was reported to be in contact with the
Pentagon and the State Department to obtain approval of the plan.

The references disclosed that Davidson conferred with
individuals interested in the anti-Castro movement in Miami in June
1959 and visited the DR in March 1959 and June 1965,
