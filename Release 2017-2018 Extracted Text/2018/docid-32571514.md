"By teletype 10/25/59, Miami Office has furnished
information from Mi 639=S (Howard Kenneth Davis, a well-placed

‘source who has beén in close touch with both prosCastro and

ontisCastro forces) which clearly reveals the hypocrisy

of Castro's accusations as well as the Castro regime's _
reediness to stoop to any means to discredit the U.S. and
make it appear that this country is to blame for all of
Castro's troubles. This information has ‘not. been disseminated
as yet in order to afford Director an opportunity to review
it prior to dlaséminations It tes. however, being furnished
to the Attorney General by letter today (10/26/59) and will

be made available to State and other interested agencies
immediately thereaftere “

; Informant advised that from 9/18~20/595 he met

in Havaria with Sergeant Fernando Fuentes @oba and Chief of
Police Efigento Almeijetras of Cubon National Police.
Almeijetras propositioned informant to take part in deal

to set trap for anti=Castro forces in US. He suggested
informant organize a 100—enan expedition in UsSs. which he

would lead in invasion of Cuba at a prearranged spot and
which would be ambushed by writing Castro forces. Almetjetras
and informant subsequently discussed this idea with Raul’ Castro
who approved plan and furnished our source with Havena address
to be used as mail drop. :

On 10/10/59 informant met wtth Almeijetras in
Havana ond latter reiterated his destre to have MM 63988
organize invasion .of Cuba from U.S. The source indicated he
would consider the matter further but gave no definite reply.

i: informant conferred with Almeijeiras and Coba again
on 10/23/59 and ms offered another assignment. Almeijeiros
proposed that source approach Rolondo Hasferrer, prominent
antisCastro leader in Miamt, or some other leading antt=Castro
leader in U5. and volunteer to undertake bombing attack
against Havana from the US.

, According to plan outlined by Almeijetras,, informant
would procure bombs with Ues's Government markings and would
deliver them to Almeijeiras after landing at prearranged
landing strip outside Havanae It was indicated that Cuban
authertiies would then issue press release claiming that’
Miami-based plone had dropped bombs. on Cubas. offering os
proof one or more of the bombs with US. markings which.
supposedly had failed to explode as well as fragments from
other bombs which Cubans would explode. Almeijeiras told
informant this hoax would enable the Castro regime to. -
propagandize against the US. State Department in order to
force Se action against antt=-Castro elements in this
countrys Almeijeiras said he wanted this ruse to take place
on 10/26/59 ond deserthed the operation as: "highly important”
to the Cuban Governments Informant will endeavor to develop

_ edditional information concerning this proposed plot.
