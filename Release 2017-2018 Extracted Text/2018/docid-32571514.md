By teletype 20/25/59, Miami Office has furnished

information fron Mu 639.S (Hourd Kenneth Davis, a well-placed

source who has been in close touch with both pro-Gastro and

arti-Castro forces) which clearly reveals the hypocrisy

of Castro's accusations as well as the Castro regime's

readiness to stoop to any means to discredit the Us. and

make it appear that this country is to blome for all of

Castro's troubles.

This information has not been disseminated

in Havona with sergeant Fernando Fuentes Coba and Chief of

Police tyigento Almeijelras of Cubon National Police.

Almeljetras propositioned informant to take part in deal

to set trap for anti-Castro forces in U.S. He suggested

informant organize o 100-mon expedition in U.S. which ne

would lead in invoston of Cuba at a prearranged spot and

which would be ambushed by wetting Castro forces.

According to plan outlined by Almeijeires, informent

deliver them to Almijeiras after landing at prearranged

landing strip outside lavand. It was inaicated that cuban.

authorities would then issue press release claiming that

Miami-based plane had dropped bombs on Cuba, offering es

proof one or more of the bombs with loss markings unich

supposedly had failed to explode as well as iragments from

other bombs which Cubans would explode. Almeijeiros told

informant this hoax would enable the Castro regime to

propagandise against the U.s. State Department in order to

force U.so action against anti-Castro elements in this

Almeijeiras said he vanted this ruse to take place

on 10/26/59 and described the operation as "highly important"

the Cuban Goverment.:
