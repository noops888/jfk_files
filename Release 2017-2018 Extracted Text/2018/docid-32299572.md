that he, TEXTER,

employed as a desk clerk at the Peace

Bridge Motel, Buffalo, working from 4:00 p.m. to midnight.

TEXTER was questioned as to the possibility that BRUNO or

CALOGERO SINATRA had registered at this motel on or about

July 13, 1962.

TEXTER advised that the name BRUNO was

vaguely familiar to him; however, he could not identify

photographs of BRUNO or CALOGERO. TEXTER related that

HERMAN WEINSTEIN, owner of the Peace Bridge Motel, frequently

registers guests at the motel under WEINSTEIN's name and

the guests' cards are thereafter not maintained

in the

file.

according to information he had learned, informed JAMES V.

LA DUCA, son-in-law of STEVE MAGADDINO,

associate of ANGELO

BRUNO, that the FBI had made inquiry at the Peace Bridge

Motel regarding registrations of BRUNO and one "SAM."

Informant stated that he had learned from MAGADDINO

that

ANGELO BRUNO had actually signed the registration card at

the motel but that either WEINSTEIN or an employee on duty

had

renoved this card from the motel files.
