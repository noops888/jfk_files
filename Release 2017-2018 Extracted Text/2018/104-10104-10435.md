MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Garrison and the Kennedy Assasaination:
William Clarens WOOD Jr., alias William BOXLEY,
201-834272

Reference: Cl/R&A Memorandum No. 9, Subject: Garrison
and the Kennedy Assassination, 5 June 1968, paragraph, 19c

A. Summary

Wiiltam Clarens WOOD Jr. was employed by CIA as a contract
instructor in clandestine operations from March 1951 when he arrived
until March 1952, when he had a nervous breakdown resulting
from family problems and alcoholiem. Sent back to Headquarters,
he served as an instructor in OTR from May 1952 to January 1953,
when his resignation wae requested, again because of heavy drinking.
During or before July 1968 Garrison, who knew that WOOD had been a

. CIA employee, hired him as an investigator assigned to Garrison's
” "investigation" of the Kennedy assausination. In December 1968, however,

Garrisen's office announced that WOOD had heen fired because it had been
ascertained that he was then active as a CIA 'bperative’. Later in 13-23
BRecember WGOD made two telephone calls to his former chief 7
requesting contact and instructions. The case is being referred to the FBI.

B. Summary of Earlier Events

1. William Clarens WOOD Jr., born 1? August 1920 in Shreveport,
Louisiana, was approved in November 1944 for overseas employment
by OSS in an assignment as a newspaperman (printing chief in a Central
Pacific operation). This approval was withdrawn on 23 December 1944,
however, because of non-concurrence by OG/AAF. He was then aseigned
to combat infantry duty in the Southwest Pacific; he was not used by OSS.
In February 1945 he visited the Honolulu Office of O85 and claimed that



aad been recruited by OSS while he was attending infantry school
, fort Benning in October 1944. He stated that Ms services were to
been used to originate and conduct radio programs in the CBI
x, that he had been investigated by Dunn and Bradstreet, and that

in the course of « long dietance telephone call to the OSS Personnel
Procurement Gffice he had been told that OSS could not use him at that
time but that he should keep in touch. The interviewing officer in
Honolulu commented in hig report to Security Officer, O55 Headquarters,
that the Dunn and Bradstreet leak should be noted and that WOOD
certainly knew more about OSS than any other potential recruit whom the
interviewer had ever seen.

2. On 13 December 1950 Subject was given a Covert Security
Clearance for use as a staff agent and was afsigned ie Chief
lustructor of Clandestine Operations. He arrived at his post in March
1951, and two months later his dependents were iesued travel clearances
to join kim. In March 1952 he suffered a nervous breakdown and was
returned to Agency Headquarters for medical observation. The medical
conclusion was that the breakdown had resulted from family troubles and
overindulgence in alcohol. In May 1952 WOOD was assigned to OTR
as an instructor in the Operations Course. In October 1952 his status
was converted to that of a staff employee, and he was assigned to OTR
as a GS-11 instructor. an

3. In December 1952 an Agency guard found WOOD lying on a
sidewalk near Temporary Eye Building. He wae bleeding from the
mouth. ‘There was no evidence of foul play. At his own request he was
taken to Emergency Hospital. In January 1953 he failed to report for
duty. Agency represesatives went to his residence, the Lafayette Hotel,
and found him under the influence of alcohol.. He was requested to report
for duty the next day, but the hotel doctor had him removed to Gallinger
Hospital because of continued intoxication. Subject's resignation was
requested on 19 January 1953 and became effective 27 January 1953.

4. On 1i July 1953 Subject telephoned the Security Office from
Dallas, Texas. He said that he would undergo brain surgery on 13 July
at Baylor Hospital, Dallas. He asked that an Agency representative
be present. Arrangements were made to ensure that anything WOOD
said under anaesthesia would remain confidential. WOOD was given
sodium pentothol, but no surgery (except a spinal tap) was performed.
In hie hospital room, te which he had been returned from the operating
room, WOOD said that he had served overseas with the CIA and had


 Sepper i

seen many people killed. ‘The CIA are a bunch of dirty cut-throate,
and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they sent one of their men to cut
mine. They think they are smart, but one of these daysin the near
future I will show them who is the smextest. They have about 100
GS-14's walking around with their heads shaped ke eggs... . Ihave
been a failure but after I get well I am going to go back to school and
get my degree and fight the CIA with everything that I can, "

5. A report of 30 April 1957 from the FBI office in Dallas, Texas,
noted that Subject had telephoned from Midiand, Texas, to a Chinese
intelligence officer in Formosa. WOOD said that he had formerly heen
employed by the CIA. He offered to halp the officer "with things I know".
He then telephoned Lubbock, Texas, and spoke to a person believed to
be his wife. He told her that he had spoken with Chiang Kai-CGhek's chief
of intelligence and that "if this thing goes through", she and the baby
weuld receive from $700 to $1609 a month.

6. In February 1967 the Darmestic Contact Service in Dallas
requested clearance to use Subject and reported that he had nat had a
drink in nine and e half years, On 3 March 1967 derogatory FBI informa-
tion and the information that WOOD was again drinking heavily were
forwarded te the DCS, which then drepped hiro as a potential source.

7. On 18 January 1968 Ron OSTROW of the Les Angeles Times
called the A/DCI and relayed a Los Angeles query about a former CIA
agent, William BOXLEY, who was an investigator for Jim Garrigon.
The A/DCI replied, “no comment."

06
8. In April 1968(Paul ROTHERMEL, | security officer for Hunt
Oll Company, Texas, seid that he had b: visited by a Billi WOOD who
was conducting investigations in Dallas for Jim Garrison under the allas
of Bill BOXLEY. WOOD was making inquiries about the CIA and its
operations. It was further reported that WOOD was well known in
Houston and that hie connection with Garrison was ne secret.

9. On 12 July 1968 the New York Times (p. C35) carried an article
headlined "Garrison Claims Foreign Spy Link", The article includes
the following:

"Over the telephone, Mr. Garrison ‘also introduced an
investigator for his office, Bill Bozley, as a former

3

SERDLT
Rabid


Central Intelligence Agency instructor in the ‘clandestine
operations department'. He said he had found Mr. Boxley
while seeking a ‘man who had been with the intelligence
agency but etill cared about the United States.'

“Myr. Boxley then said his real name was William C.
Wood; he was forty-eight years old, originally from Texas;
he had worked 10 years as a newspaper reporter -- last
on The Denver Pest from 1948 to 1950; he had been with the
intelligence agency two to five years in the 1950's overseas
and in Washington and had ‘used as many as 10 different
names in operations with the agency'."

10. The baste facte about WOOD were provided to the FBI by
CSCI 316/02725-68 of 15 July 1968. Additional relevant information
was requested. The Bureau replied on 18 July 1968 that the Berkeley
Barb", published by the Underground Press' Syndicate, had stated in
its isave af 29 December 1967 -- 4 January 1968 that Bill BOXLEY,
an investigator for Garrison, had verified a Mafia plot to kill Garrison.

“MM. ‘The New Orleans Times-Picayune of 10 December 1968
carried the following:

“The office of Orleans Parish District Attorney Jim
Garrison Monday announced the removal of a member of
the staff investigating the assassination of President John
F. Kennedy because of alleged involvement with the CIA.

“ 'William Boxley was fired after evidence recently
developed by the District Attorney's gtaff indicated current
activity by him as an operative of the Central Intelligence
Agency, ‘ the office said.

“Boxley's initial service with the CIA was in Washington,
D. C., where he served for years ag an active agent for ‘what
was then termed the Department of Covert Activity', according
to the office.

“The office said federal intelligence efforts to interfere
with the investigation into President Kennedy's aesasaination
have been occurring since the beginning of the inguiry'."'



12, The New Orleans Times-Picayune of 12 December 1968
included the following item:

"Garrison also commented on William Bexley,
an investigator he fired on Monday because, Garrison
said, he was an operative of the Central Intelligence
Agency.

" ‘He was not only a CLA agent,‘ said the DA, ' but
| he was one on a very high level’. Asked what proof his
| office developed, Garrison said it concerned material
that Boxley had put in written form.

“Bexley, contacted in Austin, Tex., told the
Times-Picayune on Wednesday that he has not been
involved with the CIA or any federal agency since 1952.

“He said he belicved Garrison ‘has been genuinaly

| misled' about hie CIA involvement, adding: ‘I am sure

| he believes ag strongly in thie (his alleged CIA involvement)

i ae he once believed in me." Boxley said he would cooperate

(| _, @ompletely with Garrieon's office in yaturning to it material
he still has in his possession.

Boxley said the only written material he ever provided
Garrison's office was a description of how various intelligence
agencics operate.

Boxley said he wae ‘really sad‘ over his firing by

Garrison, but added that he believed no one could convince
| Garrison that he was not an agent of the CIA."

Cc. Current Developments

13. On 27 December 1968 Dr. Stephen Aldrich of DD/S and T
informed the Office of Security that at 1600 hours on 27 December he
had received a telephone call from Subject, who had been hie subordinate
inf] CI/R&A called Dr. Aldrich, who supplied the following
additional information:

Yo


SECRET

a. WOOD eaid that he was calling from a pay
phone in a Sears Roebuck store in Dallas. He provided
a home telephone number, which we have net been able
to verify, and he believes that this telephone is bugged.

b. WOOD had found the telephone number of
Dr. Aldrich in the directory. His only previous call was
made in 1966, when he requested a recommendation for
@ uewepaper job for which he was applying. Dr. Aldrich
referred him to Personnel.

c, Subject told Dr. Aldrich on 27 December that
he had information which he urgently wanted to communicate
to CLA. He sounded upset.

14. C/CI/R&A advised Dr. Aldrich that if Subject telephoned

| again, he should be told that his call had been referred te the preper
j authorities. Because of the information reported above, there was
@ possibility of provocation.

15. In the mid-afternoon of 28 December 1968 Subject again
telephoned Dr. Aldrich from an unknown location. He asked whether
someone would be in touch with him. Dr. Aldrich said that Subject’s
information had been relayed to those responsible and that he had no
information about future contact. Subject said that he was not trying
to invelve Dr. Aldrich but that he did have information to relay. He
| sounded less frightened than on his previous call. He suggested that
whoever called or visited him should identify himself by referring to
information held in common {i.e., in 1951-1952}. Out of a
job, WOOD had received two or three offers of employment but was not
sure of the identities of the prospective employers and feared
provocation, presumably from Garrison's office. Apparently he belleves
that the FBI is monitoring hie home telephone.

16. It is our intent to ask the Bureau to relay this information
to its office in Dallas and to instruct an FBI representative to call
upon Subject and request elucidation, because such information
