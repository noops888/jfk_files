To substantiate his claims to having served as Deputy
Chief of the Seventh Department during this period, NOsENKo !.
describes KGB involvement in the recruitment of
the_arrests of jand BARGHOORN, and the investigations
of OSYALD, and of former KGB officer CHEREPANOV,
Ris arscovery-tneel was a GRU agent, and his assignment
to Geneva. Even i) IKO learned of the operations as
he described and they were-as he described (there are substan-
tial reasons why they might have been Gonducted by KGB
elements other than the Seventh Department), they are atypical
with respect to NOSENKO's own description of Seventh Depart-
ment operations. They do not accurately characterize, as
NOSENKO claims, KGB counterintelligence operations against
tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventh Department
service, NOSENKO's explanations. for his assignment to
Geneva in 1964 are no more plausible than for his earlier
assignment there in 1962. NOSENKO has asserted that he was
not a lieutenant colonel as the temporary duty authorization
indicated, but a captain, a rank incongruous with a:Deputy.
Chief of Department and one from which he presumably would
have been promoted as he assumed the senior KGB positions |:
which he claimed to have held. |
