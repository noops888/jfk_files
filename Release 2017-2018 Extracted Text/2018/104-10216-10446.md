Isabel Becquer, Eduardo Suarez, and Valentin Sanchez all spoke
wut in support cf Pric 2s the President of the Exile Govern—
ment. They had urged a group consisting of Orlando Manrique,
Orlando Puente, David Cabezas, and Rafael Guas to support the
proposal. Suarez stressed that now is the opportune moment to
carry out the campaign to form a Government in Exile since he
has been informed by "reliable sources" that "the Americans”
are, withdrawing support of all Cuban exile groups. Emilio
Nénez, Sergio Carbo, and Nestor Carbonell.all spoke of the
need to unite all Cubans and to form a fighting front with or
without "the Americans.” faa

Dr. Enrique Huertas, the last speaker, opposed the idea of
appointing Prio as President of the Government in Exile.
Huertas said the meeting had not been called for that purpose,
the persons attending the meeting had not had time to exchange
thoughts on the proposal, and they did not represent all pro-
ponents of a government in exile. After various debates, it
was agreed that two Commissions should be appointed as follows:
the first would write a manifesto explaining to the Cuban
exiles the importance of an exile government and ask for
support from all Cubans. The members of this Commission are
Sergio Carbo, Eduardo Suarez, and Rafael Guas. The second
commission was named the “Organizing Commission" and includes
Prio, Isabel Becquer, Juan M. Salvat, Huertas, Carlos Warquez,
Oscar Gans,, Ramon Martin, and Alfredo Gonzalez. It was also
agreed to offer Juanita Castro Ruz a position on this Commission.

Government official who has traveled frequently throughout the
Caribbean and Central America, where he maintains close friend-
ships with a wide range of military and political leaders.
Source is a rightist, a trained reporter, and his information
has been fairly reliable in the past.

A meeting of the Organizing Commission was held on 15 March
1965 in. the home of Alfredo Gonzalez at 2300 N.W. 10th

Street, Miami. All members of the Commission attended except
Gans and Marquez who were out of town, and Salvat who evidently
does not agree with the group's proposed action. A document:
prepared and approved by the group probably wil] not be

issued in the immediate future because Salvat informed Prio
that he would not sign it.

The Commission discussed the following formulas for selecting
a@ government in exile, but no agreement was reached on the
exact formula to be used. 1) Submit to the exile community
a list of 50 names from which. 15 candidates receiving the
highest combined vote would be chosen. The person receiving
the highest number of votes would be elected president and he
would form his government from the remaining 14 candidates;
2) three candidates would be selected; the person receiving
the most votes among the three would form the government atid
the other two would be his assistants; 3) one candidate
would be chosen and he would be empowered to form his own
