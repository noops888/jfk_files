similar

to what you have already discussed with Rockefeller,

having to

with the oswald situation and other things.

Mr. Angleton.

well, to begin with, I went into OSS in

1943, in 1943 from

the infantry/and then Iwas assigned to an

embryonic counter

Intelligenc

e unit under General

Donovan. My immediate

was James R. Murphy, who had been

a protegee and obtaineds

law degree in General Donovan's

office. And he is a

racticing attorney here in Washington.

And he was Chief of

5-2, which was the counter intelligence.

And during that

time a number of

wus

were put together who

had never had

any experience in the subject. And that included

people such as donnie oaks, who was the head of the editorial

page of the

New

York Times, and Ben Wells

and

a tremendous

cross-section of American life.

And therewas a training intensive in

this

country, and

I

was

to London. And the purpose

of thatewas to ab-

sorb

the British experience, and more important

the breaking

of

German codes.

The breaking of the German codes, which is relevant to

out

activity, was

really done in England. And by way

Mr. Angleton. What I am trying to say is tha

is very comparable with its problems as communications intelligeno

during the war when the lives of men were involved in troop

movements.

And, therefore

the idea of opening up the doors and

things, and so on, to me seemed absolutely contrary to the

spirit, and what had beentgoing on for 22 years.

And during that time

We

had obtained, for example, by

way of production, Khrushchev' sagecret

speech which prac-

tically created revolutions in Hungary and Poland.

I was just simply

reiterating ther

problem of the immi-

gration. This ided

of opening the doors

an

létting the light

breaking down

the need to

the imni-

the soviets should learn the extent of the ac-

tivities.

Now, the production ran

from everything, such

astithe

speech of khrushchev's against Stalin, it ran into

first hard information on nuclear explosives, and it

fan

into practically the whole

It started to worry me, because he was

I will turn it

back to coünsel.

Was there any conversation in whin

Szulc or Hersh talked

to Colby about

thesematters? Did yousever

get any impression

that they were implying that Colby

was their source?

Mr. Angleton.

The only

thing that came up is that when

I saw Colby yesterday

which

is the first time since

December - he told me

that.

he had bought a theory of mine on

Szulc, but he did not

any misgivings on Hersh.

lle

said that one year

would not have permitted the operation

And I

told him that he was erroneous.

that to use that

guide was simply not to understand what

theogame is all about.

Andhwhen Philby was stationed in Washington he helped

the FBlain working on some communications intelligence which

led

to the

identification of Klaus Fuchs.

But inspite of

Philby

being a Soviet agent, the Soviets were prepared

to let

laus Fuchs go down the drain rather than hurt philby.

Senator Baker. As an ultimate cover?

Mr. Angleton. Precisely.

if any information you can give us about the Oswald situation.

For instance, does the Agency keep a file, or does it havo

MI. Angleton. They have a file. They have, I think, more

than one. I think they have a subject file, and in that they

have all the documentation that went to the Warren Commission

through Mr. Raymond Rocca, who is my deputy.

And then there is a lot of undigested material that was

brought out after the Warren Commission.

Senator Baker. Was there ever any inquiry? Or do you

because we didn't regard him as bona fides.

Vassily, the British agents, and many agents in France, a

alleged penetration in the U.S., et cetera.

Senator Baker. And did McCone accept your advice?

MI. Angleton. He did, except that I understood that

a lot of it has been declassified. And when he gave this

schorr

interview recently with

Shor, I called his executive officer

Elder and I asked him, and he said, who in the Agency ever

alleged to McCone that we now had re-established the bona fides?

And I said, he is an old

man and doesn't think too

well, et cetera, and don't give me that stuff.

And he said, well, I will give it to you.

And I never heard from him since. But McCone was a man

whowould not have made this statement. He has total recall.

Senator Baker. I am sure he does.

Do you have an opinion as to whether or not Oswald was

Infact a Soviet agent?

MI. Angleton.

Well, let me put it this way.

I don't think that the Oswald case is dead. There are too

many leads that were never followed up. There's too much in-

formation that has been developed later.

For example, in 1966, in a Soviet book on Cuba there is

a photograph of Khrushchev, a photograph of Castro, a photograph

the Soviet KGB operational man in Mexico. When the Mexican

police

arrested Castro as a student, they found in his note-

books the name of Leontov, KGB, Mexico.

Now, photographs 61, and so on, are in a KGB journal for

Soviet citizens abroad. It is a bible, 75 percent KGB staff.

Photograph of Brezhnev, Castro, Alexiev, Leontov.

Now, we had a double agent after the assassination,

who made

a number of allegations that he acquired from the

Chief of KGB, Mexico, Yatskov and he was a superior of Leontov.

Now, after the assassination Khrushchev was in Cairo on

a state

visit. And he pulled an

American journilist aside, and

totally

out of context, expressed the view that there was a con-

spiracy, and it involved the Right wing of the U.s.

The thingwas totally out of context. And he planted

this bug in this fellow's ear.

We had double agents who stated that the KGB put all of

their personnel for

six months on working on the assassina-

tion, and had concluded that

an American Right Wing business

under Johnson was to succeed in power.

And I am not talking

about petty informants. I am talking about men whowere ascer-

tained members of the KGB and part of the Soviet

elite.

Mr. Schwarz. You sald that Nosenko, one of the reasons

you suspected Nosenko was a double agent, or a planted agent,

rather, was because he was saying things that were contra-

dictory to some other high quality person who theretofore had

been giving you information before Nosenko came-to this

country?

MI. Angleton. That is right.

MI. Schwarz.

What was the nature of the information

relating to the Kennedy assassination that the high quality

person had given you?

MI. Schwarz. Let me say this so that it makes

a little

more sense.

In

December 1961 a member of the KGB in Helsinki defected

to us.

His

name is Golitzen. He has never been in service,

except Jack Anderson came out with

erroneous

account of it,

alleging that he had stated there was a plot to

assassinate

Nixon.

He did not make such a statement.

MI. Kirbow.

Do you think this statement should be on

the record?

Mr. Angleton.. I don't mind it being on the record after

the Anderson

article. They have been looking for him.

Now, his is probably without any question the most major

defection since World War Il as far as Soviet intentions,

soviet

organization,

and Soviet operations are concerned.

And the

reason,

among others, that it was

so important wag

he had decided to defect many years prior to December of 1961,

if the opportunity ever arrived. And therefore he used those

many years breaking down the compartmentalization of the KGB

in order to acquire the kind of information which would be most

valuable to the Us, and to our allies.

Therefore he refused

many assignemtns abroad, but tried

to always remain

in headquarters and get himself appointed to

investigative commissions and other things of this sort which

would get into everybody elses's business. Among other things,

he spent many years

in the training

schools for people who

came back for six weeks

from different parts of the world to

brag

about their achievements.

And he absorbed all of this

information.

And

among other things, he stated that he gave the

crytograms and circumstantial evidence of penetrations

throughout the West.

And then the Soviets rapidly transferred 300 of their

people after his defection.

And as is normal in a case of

this kind, the big problem

is to write a damage report, which

means the whole service would come to a standstill. And the

objective would he to

Now, when we did a similar operation on the Sergeant

Dunlop who was working in the National Security Agency and

committed suicide, if I am not mistaken we came to approxi-

mately 400,000 documents that he could have had

access to,

although he may not have had. And it is interesting to note

that after his assassination, in a search of the quarters,

the Bureay, of whoever did the search, found six of my letters

Senator Baker. Did you speak of the assassination?

Mr. Angleton. After his suicide. I am sorry.

Mr. Miller. You used the term assassination.

MI. Angleton. I meant suicide.

MI. Miller.

The word is interesting, because it is

charged, as you know, that he was assassinated.

MI. Angleton. Maybe I was thinking out loud of something.

In any event, the 1969 Golitzen reports to NSA were in

a plastic bag, as

I recall, in the attic. And there was

question of whether he passed them before or after.

those cases which were perishable, the French, the British,

and ourselves, etcetera. And we had never had a second Chief

Director, which means the FBI type of sovlet, defector in our

lives, and all of this out of the blue, and no contact as in

Geneva six months after the defection of Golitzen.

MI. Schwarz. And the date is when in relations to the

Kennedy assassination?

Mr. Angleton.

Well, this was a contact, this was not a

defection. He came to us once for information prior to the

assassination.

And then in Moscow the Soviets -- and I am not going

into a lot of names, a

member of the Second Chief Directorate,

gave an American tourist a stack of documents

from the Second

Chief Directorate, the FBI, relating. to how they

got

, and others of our agents, which

ghowed

they didn't get them through a two-headed source, but they got

it through a

on our

side.

So the leads rant into the thousands from

Golitzén,

and thousands and thousands of pages of transcript, interro-

gation, exhibiting photographs, and identifications, which in

turn would refresh

his memory on other courses.

And out of

that ceme

the finalization of the case of Philby, Burgess, and

all that, the Vassily case

in the British Admiralty, and

some

other cases, and

many cases

so on.

But when the assassination took place --

Mr. Schwarz. The Kennedy

aggassination?

Mr. Angleton.

When the Kennedy assassination took place,

Golian called me immediately and stated that the modus

operandi with any defector from anybody's army to the soviet

Union required that he go through processing by the 13th

Department of the KGB.

Mr. Schwarz. Which is their assassination department?

MI. Angleton. Which is their assassination department,

which is called their Affairs for Executive Action.

And there are two reasons

for it.

Number one was, to

find out what sophisticated weaponry or training he might have

had that would be of use to them.. And number two, whether it

was more valuable to reinfiltrate him into the National Army

for future activity.

Mr. Schwarz. Of the nature of assassinations?

MI. Angleton. Of anything. It could be sabotage, or

intelligence, or whatever.

AND THIS WAS THE SOP on the dealing with military

defectors.

Now. when

the soviet Government turned over to

the US

all the documents that led

to the

interest

regarding Oswald

stay in

the Soviet Union, there was nothing there indicating

processing by Department 13.

Nosenko, whom we hid once in Geneva, he went back to Moscow.

And in my view he would have never come back on the scene

CHEREPANOU

because they brought this Cheraponov thing in to have the locus

shifted from where we would have controls, in Geneva, to

Moscow where they would have all the controls. And that would

be the Directorate. And therefore they would have the direct

means of counteracting

and mutilating the leads and the

importance of Golitzen's defection.

But the tourist gave the documents to the American

Embassy. And we photographed them. The Charge insisted

on

giving them back to the soviets on grounds that

it would be

appropriate.

MI. Schwarz. These are not the official documents deal-

ing with Oswald but the documents that the man tried to pass

in Switzerland?

MI. Angleton.

The Second Chief Directorate, he took all

of the documents out of the FBI Soviet section

and gave them

to the

tourist and we read how we got caught on

things..

So there is the

assassination. Cheraponov allegedly

was chased to the Turkish border and shot. And in my view

this is a myth, because in 1918 Cheraponov was stationed in

Belgrade, and he tried to defect to us. and at

another time

tried to establish

liaison and contact with the Birtish MI-6,

at a-time when Philby was Chief of Intelligence, meaning

• that the approach would have been under Philby

in 1948, and

then he reappears in the early 1960's as a member of the

Second Chief Directorate.

That is enough of Cherapanov. But it is important only

from the soviet point of view, the best laid plans fall apart.

And then out of the blue, Nosenko, whom we would never have

seen again, reappears after the assassination in Geneva, and

tells us he wants to defect.

Mr. Schwarz. And he provided information which was

inconsistent with Oswald being the Russian agent?

Mr. Angleton. I am coming to that.

So immediately we tried to get the breadth of his

career

so that we know where the priorities are. And the first thing

he tells us is that while he was in the Second Chief

Directorate in the American Section, Oswald's KGB dossier went

over his desk. And his first story, as I recall it, was that

it was two volumes or three volumes. And finally it went down

to one volume and a small sheaf of papers.

Also he said that the dossier showed clearly that Oswald

was mentally unbalanced, and that he was a poor shot, and:

therefore couldn't get a hunting license, and a lot of stuff

of this sort.

And then on all of these outstanding leads -- penetra-

tions, of the French, the Americans, the British codes, bugging

of the Embassy, all of these different

sorts

-- Nosenko had

something

to do which diverted us from Nosenko's leads. And

In the normal course of events, we might have put Golitzen in

contact with Nosenko, which may have meant the assassination

of Golitzen, because the whole approach of Nosenko was one

where logically you would bring them in and have two bodies,

one from the first Chiéf Directorato, that is, Gollezen, the

CIA part of the system, and the other from the FBI part of the

system, and therefore you would have a very strong balance

against the KGB. But we didn't do that. Because there were

certain things, litmus papers, questions put to Nosenxo..

And

as far as I was concerned, if he was bona fide he would

have

answered one way, and

he did

not answer

that way. And they had

to do with some deeper secrets regarding a meeting of the

2000 members of the KGB and the Soviet Government in May of

1959, presided over by Shelepin

and attended by many members

of the Central Committee

on the reorientation of the soviet

Services and the return to Leninism wherever intelligence

operations has a political objective. And this is

a part of

the process of de-stalinization.. And so when we took him

unwittingly chronologically through his career, he : omits

all of this phase. And we had three of four or five other test

things, where their damage report would not show that Golitzón

had access, because

it was

part of his way of getting

in and

breaking compartmentation. And therefore they would have no

evidence that he had

sufficient knowledge.

MI. Schwarz.

the information that he provided

to you was that Oswald was a mental case and was a bad shot?

Mr. Angdeton. Right.

MI. Schwarz. And you had also received from Nosenko --

ME- Angleton, Golition -i from collegen -- information

that suggested the normal practice was for Department 13,

which had responsibility from the Russian KGB for assasgina-

tions, to interview miltitary defectors. And we had observed

that when the Russians

transferred documents concerning

Oswald, that there was no reference in there to any such

debriefing by Department 13. And another important part of

it is that there was a man who was handling George Blake from

London, who was Counselor of the Soviet Embassy. And when he

returned he became head of the 13 Department, General Rodin.

But he was

there

under an

alias as a civilian. He was the

Chief of the KGB in London, and a very high grade man.

Then

he took over the Department 13 and reinvigorated

it.

MI. Schwarz. And what was his connection with Oswald?

Mr. Angleton. I am

saying that he was head

of Department

13, and was head of Department 13 at a time -- I mean, he had

Department 13 and this is a point I think I should make, that

the Agency, unlike the Soviets, does not have an assassination

department. The Soviets

have always had an assassination

department, which is totally sealed off from the rest of the

organization. People from the outside Inn: very little about

what goes on in that.

People career-wise stay in there. And

they report to the Chairman of the KGB, and drop off, who in

turn report to the politboro.

And therefore it is an entirely

sealed organization which is capable of all forms of action,

whether it be sabotage -- an illegal sabotage or what, an

illegal directorate which is independent of the rest of the

KGB -- nuclear sabotage, and all this type of thing, and

infiltration of enemy forces in the event of war. And of

course assassination, the assassination of Ukrainian leaders

in West Germany.

MI. Schwarz.

Do you recount that simply because it makes

more significant the

absence of any reference to Oswald because

you are giving evidence as to the vigor of Department 13, or

did you recount it because there is a

more direct connection

with Oswald?

MI. Angleton.

This

is related to what I told Mr. Dulles,

I thought it was absolutely

wrong

to close

the door on the

life of the commission, and instead there

should be

a statement

that we are not in

a position -- that on the fact available to

us during the given period, these arè our conclusions. And

you stated that that information was suppressed from the

Mr. Angleton.

The word suppression is probably not the

right word because, I will be very honest with you, I was told

the other day. that

the information was given

classified, and

it was given to

Helms

or somebody, or MI. McCone, who passed

it as a classified

document.

I have asked for it, but I

haven't seen it.

Why did you

it went.

I was sitting in the position as to where that information

would go, I was opposed

to it. And my pfficial position was

that. And I ghought until relatively recently that it never

went.

Phona (Ares 202) 326-6000

And then all of a sudden they have declassified a lot of

piece

stuff. And Mr. Rocha, who was the point of record of the

Agency's dealing with the warren Commission, told me that

Nosenko stuff was the stuff they were declassifying.

Now, his

role was not one of the executive nature. Actually

it was

simply because he was

a great scholar and a great many other

things, and therefore

he had the most catholic background to

handle something as eomplex

as the Warren Commission, not in

exercising executive power, but working on behalf of the

Director and all

the Directorates and everything pertaining

to the Warren Commission. He

is a

tidy individual.

And in

fact Mr. Belin has made a great deal of use of him in the

commission's business,

and he is the one that had done all the

digging for the commission, and so on, on a whole series of

matters that I am not familiar with.

But my point. to you -- and this is very difficult to

explain -- is that the question of Nosenko created a very

great division in the life of all

counterintelligence as to

bona fides, as in all questions of when you

are dealing with

double identification agents, there is always dispute.

But let me just

line up the order of battle here. Our

Chief of the Soviet Division accepted the fact that the man

was a provocation. His Chief of Counterintelligence accepted

the fact that the man was a provocation.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you mean provocation, or providing

falge information?

MI. Angleton. An Agent Provocateur.

I said he was false. My man said he was

false. And it

isn't

a parrot affair, each one reads the same stuff and

analyzes and come to their own conclusion. And Golitzen,

who defected, based only on the Geneva, first encounter in

Geneva, not the defection, had predicted in

advance that

because of the enormity of his defection they would send a

provocateur into the west to destroy and mutilate his leads.

So it was a question

of

awaiting, you might say, who

knocks on the door. And here is Nosenko.

Now, since then the Chief of the soviet Division who is

no longer

there, has recanted in a way -- the Inspector

General went into all this -- he is today the NIO dealing in

Soviet Affairs, the National Intelligence Officer

on Soviet

Affairs.

And his counterintelligence man, a fellow named

Pete Bagley, who is the brother of the

two Admirals Bagley,

and one of the best men we had, left the Agency and

is now

in Belgium

in private life. And I can go all the way through

these other people who have been dispersed.. But the record

will clearly reflect that the preponderance of all individuals

Now, is it your current understanding that what was

provided to the Warren Commission was the raw infomration

brought by Nosenko, or was the Warren Commission also provided

with the opinion of persons such as yourself and others as you

have recounted that he was

providing false information?

MI. Angleton. I don't think the Warren Commission was

ever faced with the lasue of the Internal issues of Goldtila.

or Nosenko.

Mr. Schwarz.

you first said that the information was

suppressed from the Warren Commission, and then you said no,

it is your understanding now --

Mr. Angleton. Well, the word suppression isn't the right

word, I said. One went to

argue the matter and it was agreed

by higher authority that the information shouldn't be --

Senator Mathias. There was a value judgment made as to

the usefulness of the material?

MI. Angleton. That is right -- and not to do what the

Soviet in our mind wanted us to do, which eas to give lt

prominence and have it

come out as an official part of the

record and documents

articles,

and so on.

MI. Angleton. It was made known to them in some fashion.

Mr. Angleton. I think, as

I understand

it now, that in

presentation of it.

MI. Schwarz. But without mentioning your feelings,

certain experts thought that it was false?

Mr. Angleton. I can't respond to that. I don't know.

MI. Schwarz.

What about the information derived

from

Golitzen, which indicated in your

expert opinion that the

documents

provided by the soviet Union were, I think you put

it, funny, or strange, or misleading, because they did not

include any reference to debriefing by Department 13, was that

information provided to the Warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. I don't think so. But all

I

can

say there is this, to be realistic.

No one would expect

the

Soviet Government, regardless, to provide documents,

secret documents, on Oswald, whether he was or was not their

agent.

FBI's position and MI. Hoover's, and so on, so that he would

be more sensitive to the things, no longer being Director,

that were no longer germain to his position on the matter.

Mr. Schwarz. Was

there a connection between the FBI and

Oswald?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know the full FBI story.

I know

there was a tremendous flap

the Bureau. And one of the best

men they had in my view is a professional a man called Burt

Turner, who I understand just got his law degree. And Burt

Turner was one of the finest

men on Soviet KGB activities in

the Us, one of the analyats.

And he was in

the Washington

Field Office. And it is my understanding -- and this is

basically hearsay, but from pretty good sources -- that Burt

Turner was handling the Oswald ore related matters at the time

the president made the trip down to Texas, and that there was

some confusion that the Bureau had not turned over, or had

not taken enough initiative in turning over, all the informa-

tion on Oswald to the local police.

I had been told that

there was a black mark put against Turner's name, and that he

confronted Mr. Hoover and stated he was not going to permit,

or have

it be known

to his children, that his negligence was

responsible for the death of the President.

And he was

pretty

forceful about his position. And as a result, this was

expunged or something to that effect. And that is the reason

he went to the washington Field Office instead of staying in

Headquarters.

And then he retired. And I think his retirement had

something to do with this fact.

But this is all by virtue of hindsight with the thousands

of cases. And I cannot see any Western intelligence service

seizing on facts that Oswald will return to the Us, and then

going and saying, we will get all of this, and we will send

it to Texas.

What I am trying to say, is that the difference in their

system. With the manpower and the computers, which are mainly

ours, and whatnot, a situation of that sort is automatic.

And

we know enought about the Second Chief Directorate and the

controls, the total controls, to know that if a soviet returned

automatically, to any part of the Soviet Union he went, there

would be a dossier that would go, and there would be also an

operational directive to put him on tap, check his mail, to

do the following, and so on and to put an agent near him.

There wouldn't be any leaking

anything in the air on that.

... .....

There would be total encapsulation of that individual until

it was ceratin beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was not sent

back as

agent.

Mr. Schwarz. A moment ago in talking about the line-up,

as I think you put it, of views on Nosenko, you recounted the

views of a number of people.

And you said that one person

had changed his mind

or recanted subsequently. And you made

a reference in that connection to an Inspector General's

report. What was that report?

MI. Angleton. At one stage in all of this -- and it was

much later, after all the dust settled -- Helms got the

Inspector General, who had come from the clandestine side of

our business, to institute --I don't like to use the word

inspection, it is too authoritative -- to go into the Nosenko

matter and see if there is anything there that he

should know,

because Helms is fully aware of the split on this whole

question of bona fides, and it bothered him, because I had

brought him in touch with Golitzen, and he was fully aware of

all my activitles, and

travels

and so on.

And so this person who was chosen began to interview

everybody and reopen

the whole thing. I mean, there were 21

safe leads of stuff if you really got into all of the Golitzen

and Nosento and the other things that pertained, as I pointed

out. to the warren Commission, to the asininity of what has

happened, of

27 years of experience of myself and my two

colleagues, that these are the facts, that there are 20

cases

--

Mr. Schwarz.

You said Warren Commission. You mean

Rockefeller?

Mr. Angleton.

Excuse me, Rockefeller.

There are 20 some odd cases that a counterintelligence

officer in our buslenss should know before he even begins

to

get his feet wet.

Now, when Dr. Schlesinger came in, and I started hearing

all of these things of manaement by objectives, and synergiatio

and a lot of other things, being applied to the art forms which

we had developed, I finally got so frustrated that I thought

I would take him up on his own thing. So I got statisticians

in: to take all the safes and figure out the linear footage of

every safe drawer, all the way

on through, and to computerize

how long it would take the normal case officer to come up to

this elemental stage of being able to be launched.

That was sort of a preparatory business. And they

figured it out and they said

it would take 22 man years, we

meant that if we were 100 percent incorrect, it would be 11

man years.

And that was simply to apprise Schlesinger, and

Colby, who had never been

in counterintelligence, of what all

this problem was about. They had the idea of transferring

people back and forth and all the restlE le. And I nuer chose

anybody in that job as a rule who had either been in the FBI

or had not had very rich experience in counterintelligence.

And normally I kept outside leaks to anybody in the business

-- I had men who stayed with me for Il years, Rocca was with

me for 31 years, even

though they went into operational situa-

tions abroad and returned, and

on .

And I say this to you, because here was an IG, and

executive. And I mean this sincerely. He is one of the

really top-notch men.

But he as to undertake this burden. And it was a farce

may be something. I don't think I have evern

the paper. But I mention it simply so that you don't get the

staff that had this view. This

was a view that was shared by numbers of people who had

dealings with Nosenko. And I think the greatest authority of

all is colitzen himself, who was in the XoB, and who knew

I get the radio to

So I could get the gist of Bill's questions to them. And

and not to let them

said, tell them not to

do anything until they hear from you.

So then

I told Sam, I said, look, let's go very easy on

this -- because I didn't know anything about Bill's connection

with the Mafia and all that, but I did know him well enough

to know that he was not a frivolous man, and

that this thing

, happened, and keep in mind that ex-FBI men, contrary to public

opinion, were not very much liked by Mr. Hoover when they left

So I called Bill's house, and I asked his wife, is Bill

around?

And she said, no, he is out to dinner tonight.

And I said, look, we have

some very serious trouble.

would you please tell me where

I can locate him.

And she said, he is at Duke Zeibert's. And I called

Duke zeibert's and I managed to get him.

And I turned the

phone over to Papich, because

I did not want to be on the

record showing that this was Angleton, et

cetera.

And Papich talked to Bill, and actually I didn't hear

the discussion. It was something about, I will see you

tomorrow.

And Sam told the surveillance and all the other people

to forget it, and the Headquarters would take over.

And that is my knowledge, direct knowledge of what

Anderson and everybody

else has stated.

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Angleton, to your specific knowledge

did Bill evet attempt to use the excellent contact he had in

Havana to carry out the mission of eliminating the leader down

there, or try to get

any help out of him in that regard?

MI. Angleton. He knows

that I would have cut his throat.

assassination.

right?

Mr. Angleton. That is the thrust of what he was trying

to say. His English is such that it is very difficult.

Senator Mathias. I understand. But then some years

later -- my recollection is that you sald it was in 1967 or

1969 -- you learned that the KGB had spent six month of

employment of their top operators

in the investigation of the

Kennedy assassination, and wouldn't this fact in your mind

negate the implication of the original Golitzen call of that

they were involved?

MI. Angleton. I want to congratulate you, because that

man is a man who is also a suspect of Nosenko.

Senator Mathias. You mean in 1967?

MI. Angleton. Just to show you the ground you are

treading on, Golitzen gave

us

information regarding the

penetration of our own organization. And we worked down to an

identity. And the FBI disagreed with us. And I am

talking

about not a few minutes, but several weeks and months of work.

And the Bureau's attitude was, you have got the wrong man, and

the allegation therefore does not affect the CIA, and we

advise that you send it to the Army.

And I might add, the man who wrote that memorandum was

the Burt Turner

I mentioned who was one of the competent

FBI analysts. So it was in limbo. And we stated that "x"

was the penetration agent, and the Bureau refused to accept

that.

And in 1967 a Soviet - on whom we had a dossier on this

thing, because he was once stationed in India, and therefore

we knew who he was, and all the rest of it -- with

an unknown

coming to us as Nosenko was, he was

a real man, we had years

of surveillance on him, and

so on. And he came, and he

alleged -- and he was a. TDC, temporary duty in Washington

, here -- and he established contact with the flrst Mrs. Helms.

eventually I was called to take the case. And he stated

that among his missions to the US was to effect

the

redefection

of the return to the soviet Union of a man, and that man was

the man whom we had identified as a Soviet agent. And he went

into the whole background, that this man was one of the

highest grade illegals that they had ever had, and he was

our Agency.

So this had a tremendous impact on Burt Turner, because

he was one of the two interrogating officers. And I can't

talk to you about professional pride, but for a man of his

competence to have done it the wrong way, that hurt.

So I had a question injected, which was, what do you know

about George Blake?

And then his response was, he says, we think he is dead.

Now, hwere is a man who is supposed to be Special

Assistant to the Head of Counterintelligence in KGB, whose

mother was a secretary to Litvinov, and he comes therefore

from the aristocracy, as Nosento does, because his father was

the Minister of Maritime Affairs. And there is a statue

of

Nosenko's father.

And Golitzen had told us that men chosen

for very dangerous

missions of penetration and duplicity came

from the aristocracy. Everyone trusted them, and their fathers

and their families are heroes of the Soviet Union.

So here was this man who said as to Blake, we think he is

dead.

Two to three weeks later is when Blake escaped from

Scrubb's woods to the Soviet Union. Now, if he had come to

the US to exfiltrate as the Special Assistant to the Head of

Counterintelligence, to exfiltrate a person who worked in

the West as an illegal from the end of world War II, and

gradually worked into us, why wouldn't he have known the

exfiltartion plans of George Blake, which would have been

simultaneous, because he was a Headquarters man here on TDC.

So we handled him for six or seven weeks.

And some of the most telling parts of the interrogation

was that when he went back to the soviet Union he would have

access to archives.

And what was on our mind, and what

cryptonym that

we wanted him to work up -- and this would

relate to the third part of the damage part on Golitzen --

what did Golitzen know that they did not know he knew? What

agents in the West could be under our control as a result of

Golitzen's disclosures regarding those things?

And you can see the tremendous quality this man had of

almost getting from

our man those four or five crytonyms,

which would have told them what they wanted to know, because

there are cases they are not sure whether he knows or doesn't

know, and so on. And these are officials, and so on.

So he wasn't given that. He was given stuff that was

sort of medium low level stuff, you couldn't call it chicken

feed -- but we never told him we disbelieved in him. And he

said, if you do those things for me, I have an opportunity,

because of my mother and so on, to become lead of the American

Department of the KGB.

And the other thing he wanted, was, we took him to the

Soviet Agency and we came out later for contacts, and he stated

there was a telegram there, and he had been requested to

acquire all the information possible on the whereabouts of

Golitzen and Nosenko.

And I was actually in wisconsin.

I called my Deputy long distance and I said, if there is any

proposal put up by that individual that would

expose -- and I

use the crytonym name of Golitzen -- don't.

A week later is when he got to Moscow and he sent a cable

Coming back to what you stated, with our litmus paper and

with our analysis of him, we treated him as a walk-in, as a

part of the thing to confirm Nosenko's bona fides, and the

build-up. And he is the one who gave the full description of

the fact that for six months the place was immobilized

for this

Investigation, of all

the high level all over the works, is

the way he put it.

Senator Mathias. You contrasted the way that the russians

treat a returned defector, and

the way we treat them. And

in that connection, to your knowledge was Oswald every

interrogated when he teturned from Russia?

MI. Angleton. I don't know - I probably would know, but

I don't know whether the military -- normally that would

fall

within the jurisdiciton

of

the military, since he was a

military man who defected. So I dol't know the answer to that!

Senator Mathias.

What about from Cuba?

MI. Angleton. I can't answer that.

Senator Mathias. Or at any time?

MI. Angleton. I think the Bureau interviewed him.

Senator Mathias. The Bureau, not the CIA?

MI. Angleton. I am

certain we never did, no.

Senator Mathias. But you think the fBI did?

MI. Angleton.

That is just my sensation that they did.

Senator Mathias. We will follow that up.

This is the very last guestion. You referred to files

that are maintained on persons who have some contact with the

Soviet Union and the Soviet nationals. And I would like to .

pursue that in a personal way.

About two years ago Arbotov was in this country, and he

came to lunch in my office. And we had several members of

Congress there. Would this kind of thing be a matter of

record?
