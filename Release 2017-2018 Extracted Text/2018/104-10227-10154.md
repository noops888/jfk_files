- Comments on Cuban Revolutionary Council)

We have Feduedd the so-called civil section budget
(data) to the latest figure of $125,000 for septenber.
Monthly admin costs for this organization used to um almost
$180,000, if wa included their so-called edlitary section
(which wao salaries primarily for military staf? recruiters,
rentals for offices, médical, etc.). Our dependency pay-

ments are now at $313,700 monthly. Thia may increase slightly ©

since we are resuming monthly paymenta to widows again after
their lump eum death benefit payments run out.
To date in PY 62 (including Septexher Payments) I would

say we have expendad on thn CRC $1,208,775 for strictly de-

pendency payments and $466,000 for admin and rolated charges.

Ra Cable 1H _20364 (Xont's Heoting u/siro on 28 August 61)

_ Statements Miro's claim to have Lined up fifteen orgas
Pree and independents for an enlarged cRc,

Conment: This is usual claim of all leaders froa Garcia
Kohly, The plain facts are that any leader who can prove
official ¥. 3.. backing (policy and funda) will undoubtedly
bo able. to line up backing since the man with the purse wing
the game. wH/4/Prop points out that Coate Aguero, for example,
is not working with the CRC and dosen't intend to, unless he
would know tha CRC 19 the organteation, :

Oa the question of funding the Professional groups wo
foreed (DRE, DMR, ACJ, FORD, CPC) we still feol we should do:
80, In sero cases, it is doubtful whether they would buy CRC
control of funds. To date, they have done good work under our
direction and funding; whether they would do aa wall affiliated
with the czc is a question, In any ease, WAVE sayo they will

try to keep Miro a little more informed on the groups’ activities,
On tha chargo that Swan is under "Batistlano" Ranagement,

_ this ts false. AHFALM@4, who was running it during the otrive,

io being phased out. The station may not reflect sufficient |



Tee

liberal thinking at present, but thie will be remedied in
ths imnsdiate future. Conta Aguero will participate in
future programming, we sea no reason why CRC control of

_, Swan would sake it any better instrument against Castro.

Any problems on payments to returnees can and should
be handled at WAVE.

¥e do not understand Miro's talk about @ ney inyagion.-
The question of the older military types to go to "academies"
hae beon talked about vaguely in the past (raised, I think,
with Chamborlain), but we've never seen this list given to
Goodwin,

Tho question of who contacts Miro should definitely be
resolved. gather they (higher authorities, Tracy?) don’
want Chamberlain to continue, but should ve get officially
in contact with Miro in Hiam!? Mr. Goodwin should oo direct
if desired, Howaver, they do have contact through their
Comptroller, Paula, to our finance people.

Might raise problem of tha 7RD within the CRC. I under=
steod Bissel thought this internal grouping should be broken
sp and the organization be a CPC. Perhaps 1 Goodwin made thia
@ point it would bo done,



Incidental Points
| O£ course, tho primary Point iseeghould there be a CRC?
Wo don't need it Operationally and it doesn't seem to have
ay Support internally. M, Tharpe's points on this are good,
Any head Cuban group should be Cuban=formed, on a voluntary
basis, not U. S. pushed.
: You know, Mestre said ho had $25,000 of CRC propaganda
| money ho. didn't mow what to do vith, The only CRC oF FRD
Yagular prep work is weekly information bulletin: that costa
about $10-12,000 monthly, distributed throughout Latin Ansrica
to leading figures, a Protuguese edition for Bragil and te
Cuban delegations in Latin America, Sowetinas they do one-shot
actions (i.c., anti-Commmist book published in Mexico), They
need guidanes to spend what they already ger.
\W/4/Pinancs just told ma that WAVE called and said that
thete was $25,000 lefe ower from Last month's adein support to
the group. (1 can oaly assume this came from Paula.) ‘Therefore,
we could have cut Septeeber paymont to #100,000. we ought ys tL
tome
<Any tr se) pan
We have indications that the salary pa: te now are
virtually welfare payments co political followers rather than
for value received in anticCastro efforts. Can we afford to

keep these discredited leaders in pocket change?



Kent feels that Miro is the best of a poor lots that
41£ wa have to support a Cuban exile grouping, Hiro, at present

ie the only choice,
