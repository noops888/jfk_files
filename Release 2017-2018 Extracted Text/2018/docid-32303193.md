Information in this report of possible value to the

Internal Revenue Service has been furnished orally to Special

Agent JACK SCHWARTZ, Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue

Service, Pittsburgh, who is conducting the

investigation of

subject

for his service.

By

letter, 12/15/01, the Pittsburgh Office requestea

the establishment of a highly confidential source at the

Pines Motel, Leechburg, Pa., to cover the activities and

discussions

Of SAM MANNARINO during his visits to that

establishment.

By airtel dated 12/20/61, the Bureau refused

authorization for such an installation due to the very short

period of time that such installation could be operated, and

because the Pittsburgh Office had not developed any information

that people other than SAMUEL MANNARINO's secretary

occupied

the motel unit.

By letter 1/3/62, Pittsburgh Office advised the Bureau of

the fact that all

informants and sources familiar with any

phases of the activities of the MANNARINOs had agreed that

the IRS raid in New Kensington,

Pa., on 8/24/61, the

Westmoreland County raid of 9/17/61, the FGJ inquiry in

Pittsburgh, and the election of reform candidates for the

New Kensington city administration had all combined to make

an information vacuum in that city, due to drastically

curtailed gambling and

the resultant inactivity of the

MANNARINOs and their associates-employees.
