PROJECT REVIEW

I. Product of the Project

A)!

Soviet Coverage

‘} As noted in last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage

of the official Soviet installation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the
parallel(liaison) project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In early
January. 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the

“most active Soviet Intelligence officers. This was in response to the con-

tinuing Station.Cl program which includes the monitoring of Soviet contacts,
and the guidance received from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT
renewal, As of this date, this coverage has not been active for sufficient
time to fully evaluate its usefulness, However, it is believed that such
coverage has the potential to add materially to the Station's effort in the CI
field. Although not designed to provide positive intelligence, some by-product
of this type has been obtained, Samples are 4s follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist
by Soviet Embassy)

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962'(Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut
TITOV will visit Mexico)

Polish Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the
only successful, continuing penetration of the target, The information provided
to the interested Case Officer has in the past been described as "unique" and
"invaluable", This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as
well as the past. Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro-
duct of this coverage are:

C, Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was able to provide coverage of major firms dealing in U.S. goods
transshipment via Mexico to Cuba, This technical operation not only pro-
vided initial leads which alerted the Station to these companies, but also

was able to provide continuing information on the daily activities of the com-
panies involved, Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for illegal
transshipment of U,S, goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-
tacts and general activities. Samples of the positive intelligence production
from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:

D Communists in Mexico

3t, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the
‘ENVY, and the raw take has been partially processed by them.
‘od July 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of
1to local ODENVY for their processing, The most valuabl:
ed from the targets in this field continues to deal with con
yeneral activities of the American Communist Group in

. Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary group
active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and
not available from other sources, The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this

area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and mor:
recently Spanish Republican exiles, The product has been most rewarding in

coverage. Examples of productivity in this past project year:

iF. Counter-Intelligence Information

By its latest Related Mission Directive, Mexico City Station's major respon-
' sibilities continue to lie in the field of CI/CE matters. LIFEAT was able to
an provide a valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives in

this.field, Coverage included that on Carlos Humberto ILLESCAS, who is

acting in a covert liaison capacity between the CP and the Soviet Embassy in

: Mexico City. Besides the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field,
the following informational reporting was provided:

: : »HMM-5742, 7 July 1961 (Travel of Mexican Leftists Behind Iron
‘ Curtain)
z i HMM-5836, 18 August 1961 (Activities of Mexican Student of the
: : University of Peoples’ Friendship)

G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City
Station through. production of leads unobtainable through other assets and gen-
erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available
through a(unilateraDrelephone tap operation, The following is a selected list,
together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support
and leads provided through LIFEAT:

a

-LIFEAT/Cuban: The most noteworthy LIFEAT contribution to Station efforts
iin the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-
-vities of Transcontinental, S.A, in the illegal transshipment of U.S. materials
‘to Cuba via Mexico, LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities
lof this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican
{business community by changing the name it operated under to Inversiones
: Mexicanas, S.A, and changing its location and telephone number, Valuable
‘information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime,
i methods and contacts used in their procurement, and information on the con-
‘tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained,

* LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech
+ intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more impor-
" tantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when one of their CIS officers,

' Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempt. Through LIFEAT
"livemonitoring" of both the original and followup defection attempts, the

&: KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible attempts

by CECH to alert his coworkers or fens entrapment of the KUBARK per-

i sonnel involved,

: LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the most "classic" example of the use of a telephone
tap in providing a lead which could develop into a,vital penetration of the Polish
© intelligence occurred recently in the(BEK SKNAVE/BEICHICK operation, LIFEAT
provided the initial leads which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an
operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-
ment of the operation, It is the Station's opinion that this one instance of service
by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year, (Full
information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEX1-0463), Also of great interest
to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,
Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which
had been stolen in the U.S. and driven to Mexico, In this operation, in which
a defection attempt was considered, LIFEAT provided not only the initial leads,
but also daily operational information vital to the Station's efforts in this case,

LIFEAT/ Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is
providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this target,
Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much vital
data on personalities, contacts, and services obtained by the target esrablish-
ment must be provided, It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared
to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this
coverage progresses, The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only
present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and will

continue to provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting of any
operations against the Yugoslav target.

LIFEAT/Soviet/Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed sup-
porting information in backing Station double agent operations, In this area
the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the
agent, LIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case
officer to determine the veracity ofthe agent involved. LIFEAT also provides

_ a-needed check upon the activities of the double agent.

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles

in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various
groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the

senior ODACID official in Mexico, LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile 88°
factions both involved in planning this attempt and those opposed to it, Covera

of targets in this area also enables the Station to keep abreast of the plans and
activities ofthe various groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile
community in Mexico City.

cd : LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the re-
porting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron
Curtain countries, e travel of U. citizens, especiall i nel
Leftists, to Cuba, Through coverage of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided QDENVY with an increasing amount of
dofoxmation on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who
reside in the U.S, One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data
on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten" to regain the
former status in the U.S, film industry. eS

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has beenenhan:
through LIFEAT periodic coverage of former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK
and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or
personnel, Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially
valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations,

Conclusion
It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Stati

operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the ability of thefimilateraQ
LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest


13-00000,

to the(lia ison forces, well justify the expenditure of funds, time, personnel,
and security risk. As it has been noted in the past, that even with the Station's
. envolvement in the parallel, but[liaison}, LIENVOY operation, a change in
" attitude by the present (local government, administratio@or a change in/fovern-
' ment administrationg} could end KUBARK participation in that{liaison/project,

” There is attached a list of the HMMs produced fromm LIFEAT provided material
“during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project's
prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations,

IL. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are there-
fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time.. For this
reason percentage figures as to completion of project objectives cannot. be drawn.
However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment
‘of the objectives can be noted in that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced
in the period July 1961 through May 1962, LIFEAT has been in daily operation
during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month
being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered.

Ill, Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-
main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of a great portion

of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target...such as Soviet
Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need aris
for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so,

Until such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ- .
ment of its assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does not wish to
reveal its interest or operations to thefliaison]forces involved in the LIENVOY
operation,

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing
LIFEAT assets in "hot miké operations which require access. to telephone
ee


fEentralgJand cables. The feasibility of using LIFEAT in this type of operation
has already been proven, in a recent operation with the/LIERODE) installation

(asa targéf. Seven reels of "hot mike)’ take were obtained in test runs on
checking both the operation (including installation of the ‘Miked" instrument
in the office of the\head, of thé\LIERODE)official installation) and the equipme:
which was of radical design and conceived and built by the KURIOT technician
assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover, Unfortunately, before con
tinuous operation could get underway, the[LIERODQ installation decided upon
complete renovation of its telephone system, including the installation of a
switchboard, This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation agains‘
this particular target, unless a direct line is installed there. However, it is

. the intention of the Station to attempt coverage.of other targets of interest, In
these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in installation, line and series cross
maintenance, basehouse procurement and maintenance, and processing of tak
From the brief test runs via the/LIERODE) operation noted above, it is believ
that 'fhot mika" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatl
the Station in its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Missi:
Directive,

: Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-
tinued to be good during the period of the project review, with security being ,
stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encounte ™
which were not solved by the personnel involved, Since the success of the

ke LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-

ji quarters clearances and evaluation of new personnel will continue to be sougi:
on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment,
