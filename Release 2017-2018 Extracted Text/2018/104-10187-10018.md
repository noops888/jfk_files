PROJEC'T BRIEFING

PROJECT: LIEMPTY

ACTION :

ADD/P approval of renewal

WH - Mexioo City

1 Dec 64. - 30 NOv 65

PURPOSE:

PROGRESS:

One basehouse (LIMITED), which provided coverage of the

main gate of the Embassy, was evacuated In September 1964

because of security implications stemming from release of

the Warren Commission Report.

The future of this

property has not yet been determined but the Station has

• acquired another

the

apartment on a temporary

basis to replace

LIMITED coverage.

The Division belleves that three

photo basehouses directed against the soviet compound are

Justilled as well as the mobile coverage provided by

LIENTIAP.

During the past year two indigenous employees

were terminated

in the interest of economy.

During the

coming year oliver G. SCANTLING (p), contract agent, 1a

expected to assume other dutles

and

responsibilltles not

connected with this project.

therefore,

salary and

expenses are requested for only six months.

During a

nine month perlod the project produced 770 rolls of

operational still photographs, of which 595 were con-

cerned directly with the Embassy conpound. Based on the

performance and overall contributions of the project

suring the past year, the Station concludes that the

project is essential to the fulfillnent of the RMD and

should

be continued in the coming year.

dispatched may have been a security target.
