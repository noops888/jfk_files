he

The following answers were given me by Reichhardt and are keyed
to the questions you wanted asked of him concerning Subjects

Did he ever see DIAZ Lanz alone?

Yes.

Did he see hin as often as he wanted to?
YES.

Under whet circumstances did he see him?

In the INS offices in Miami, both alone and in the presence
of INS officers.

Was he ever denied access to him?
‘NO.

Did he have a chance to debrief hin fully? Could he have
done so?

It was not possible to debrief DIAZ fully for two reasons.
His state of mind while being held in the INS offices in
Miami was not conducive to-a proper debriefing; and there
was not enough time to obtain requirements fron Headquarters.
DIAZ was given a good prelininary debriefing by the FBI ;
immediately after his arrival, ard a thorough debriefing’

. Wes possitle only under different circumstances and with’

detailed requirements. There was no denial by INS, other
than as the result of the circunstances, of access to DIAZ,
who "theoretically could have been debriefed.
