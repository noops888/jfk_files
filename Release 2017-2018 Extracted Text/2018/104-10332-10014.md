Here it is... with Jeremy's improvements. Please read it carefully as | had to rush through this. Some of Jeremy's comments were slight
wording changes so as not to offend "the Board” so you may not notice much change. The biggest substantive change was on my FOIA
section (I have skillfully crafted this section to avoid the use of that four letter word!). Please note there is one more paragraph now
because | did add a bit about Scelso being an “official”. And don't forget to attach to Stokes-DC! letter which | will fax back to you.

Subject: Meeting with ARRB Staff

1. Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell,
Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,
Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four
releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had
been identified as poten on the
Agency's concerns} re the I requested
that the Board reconsider the release of the statements,6n ”

2. Maxwell agreed to send a “staff recommendation” to

the Board recommending that they delay the release of these

four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency. The

rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be

released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's

recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next.
.. Washington meeting (27 September). If the Board rejects the

staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing _

to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that ~

the Board would agree to delay the release.

3. Gunn requested that the Agency's additional s
evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to...
the ARRB staff by 23 September. The Agency can also brief «
the Board members at phe 27 -Sentepber meeting. As I°*

‘Mr. Scelso. It would have been in the case of dissimina-
tion of information about him, but I do not think that any
operational action would have been taken to apprehend him or

to contact him or to try to force him back to the United

weenaves HSCA (RG 233)

States,

Mr. Goldsmith. What about in terms of -- how would the

dissemination have been treated differently?

21024 (202) $5

Mr. Scelso. Well, it simply means that we would have
disseminated any additional information that we got.
Mr. Goldsmith. Did Headquarters ever criticize the

Mexico City station for failure to send this information?

Mr. Scelso. No. That was not because we were trying to

go easy on them, it is simply because it is in the nature of

SMOtLN tes

the business. What you are trying to do is engage, as I used
to say, in important illegal manipulations of society,

secretly.

Mr. Scelo. Yes.

Now, why did they not report everything they found out?
Mr. Goldsmith. Answer your own question.

Mr. Scelo. The telephone center envoy was manned by

American... These people were just inundated with information

and apparently did not extract this and transmit it back to

Washington.

ac,

which only were divulged after the assassination. It is an

enormous problem. Mexico had one of the biggest and most! :

active telephone intercept operations in the whole world

and the job of processing this material is just impossible.
Mr. Goldsmith. Let's go through this step by step,

although I was not going to do this at this time. I am going

to modify the line of inquiry somewhat.

Do you know how many telephone intercepts there were

in the Mexico City station?

Mr. Scelo. How many lines were being tapped?

a

Mr. Goldsmith. Yes, at the Cuban and then at the Soviet.
Mr. Scelo. I think there are about @0’lines being tapped

altogether: That is just the number that sticks in my mind.

Mr. Goldsmith. Thirty “medning“a’ total of sthicty: from alu

going back 15 yaars.

Mr. Goldsmith. In any event, your earlier comment was

Another important operation directed against the Cubans ty
sophisticated provocation that won the c1A Intelligence Mf
for Stan Archenhold,t the case officer who conceived it
operation consisted of a series of letters sent to the Cuban intaj
gence service in.their Mexico City Embassy from a person’
purported to be a cra officer trying to help them. The
purport to implicate Joaquin Ordoqui, a respected,
Teader. of the Cuban Communist Party and a high-ranking
tary leader, as a cra agent, The letters are based on informa
from Carlos Manuel Pellecer, the Guatemalan exile and peneiiy:
tion agent, who was closely associated with Ordoqui and Margy
Rodriguez when all three lived in Mexico City during the lay
1950s. The letters continue to be sent to Cuban intelligence’,
‘though Ordoqui was arrested in 1964, and the desired contr,
versy and dissension in the Cuban revolutionary leadership
followed, ‘

As the cover of Sherry, the chief of the Cuban operations sx,
tion, is in the Embassy consular section, he has been able to meg
several of the Cuban consular officers directly. However, his maig
agent for direct assessment of the Cubans is Leander Vourvoulias,
Consul of Greece and President of the Consular Corps.

Support Operations
The support operations must also be detailed. (The joint oper.

ion for telephone tapping, LIENVOY, is effected In COOperatio
‘stir tne Mexican autores mc MES a capacity for about fory’
lines. The station provides the equipment, the technical assistance,
couriers and transcribers, while the Mexicans make the conne
tions in the exchanges and maintain the listening posts. In add

tion to monitoring the lines of the communist diplomatic mission
and those of Mexican revolutionary groups, LIEN VOY also coves]
special cases. For years the telephones of ex-President Cérdeas}
and his daughter have been tapped, and recently tapping bs]
started on that of Luis Quintanilla, a Mexican intellectual whoi
planning a trip to Hanoi with the publisher of the Miami Nea|
and with a fellow of the Center for the Study of Democrati]

532

ions in Santa Barbara, Reports on plans for this trip are
immediately to the White House, :

"The station also has its own unilateral telephone-tapping

peration which is limited to special cases where the involvement

‘the Mexicans is thought to be undesirable. Connections for this

tion are made outside the exchanges by telephone company
‘eagincers who work as station agents, as in the case of the bugging
‘of the Cuban Embassy (L1sAMPAN). However this is restricted as
for as possible in order to avoid damaging relations with the
“Mexicans in the event of discovery.
"Travel control, general investigations and occasional surveil-
fance are the duties of a six-man team called L1FiRE. They obtain
fight-travel lists from the airport, which are passed daily to the
station and take photographs of passengers to and from com-
munist countries and of their passports as they pass through
immigration.

Another eight-man surveillance team, known as LIEMBRACE,
bas vehicles (including a Volkswagen photo-van) and radio-
communications equipment and is mainly concerned with Soviet/
satellite and Cuban targets. It is administered by Jim Anderson,
who also controls another eight-man team (Lirice), similarly
equipped, which deals with the Mexican revolutionaries and other
miscellaneous targets.

Postal interception is mainly directed towards the mail-from
communist countries, but can occasionally be used to get corres-
pondence from selected Mexican addresses.

As in every station, a variety of agents assists in support tasks
which they perform in the course of their ordinary jobs. For
processing the immigration papers for station non-official cover
personnel, for example, Judd Austin,t one of the US lawyers in
Goodrich, Dalton, Little and Riquelme (the principal law firm
serving American subsidiaries) is used. The Executive Vice-
President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico
City, Al Wichtrich,t channels political information to the station
that he picks up in his normal work with American and Mexican
businessmen. For technical support the station has an officer of
‘sp under Embassy cover with a workshop and qualifications
inaudio, flaps and seals, and photography.

Communist Party Operations

The station cP section consists of two case officers, Wat
Thomast and Ben Ramirez,t both under Embassy cover, pls

526

F two case officers outside the station under non-official cover: Bob
Driscoll,t a retired operations officer now working under con-

agract, and Julian Zambianco who was transferred from Guayaquil
‘to Mexico City about a year ago. These officers are in charge of
agent and technical penetrations against the revolutionary organi-
zations of importance, The quality of this intelligence is high,
although not as high as it was before 1963. In late 1962 Carlos
Manuel Pellecer,} the station’s most important communist party
peactration-agent, broke openly with communism by publishing
a book. He was a leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party
(eat) and had been Minister of Labor in the Arbenz government
during the 1950s. However, after the Agency-sponsored over-
throw of the Arbenz government Pellecer made his way to Mexico
City where for years he was the station’s best source (cryptonym:
LINLUCK) on all the revolutionary organizations in Mexico, not
just the Guatemalan exiles. His book, of course, was financed by
the station and distributed by the Agency all over Latin America,
Pellecer is still being used by the Mexico City station as a propa-
ganda agent, as with other former penetration agents who form-
ally break with communism without revealing their years of work
as spies — Eudocio Ravines,t the well-known Peruvian defector
from communism is a parallel case. Another book by Pellecer,
also financed by the station, has just appeared. This book is a
continuation of cra exploitation of the Marcos Rodriguez and
Joaquin Ordoqui cases in Cuba, and is aimed at denigration of the
‘Cuban revolution. 7

‘The station also collects information about communists from
the US living in Mexico. Many of them arrived during the Mc-
Carthy period and some have subsequently become Mexican
citizens. Information about them is mainly of interest to the FBI,
which calls them the American Communist Group in Mexico
City (aceMc). Information collected about them includes that
obtained through the LIENVoy telephone-tapping operation des-
ctibed below,

‘The station also receives copies of reports from FBI penetration
operations against Mexican revolutionary organizations. Mexico
is the only country in Latin America, except Puerto Rico, where.
the FBI continued operations against the local left when the cla
took over in 1947. The Fx! intelligence is of high. quality.

This Committee has made an attempt to determine
which telephone lines at the Soviet and Cuban

diplomatic compounds were subject to this electronic

intercept operation in September and October of 1963.
The monthly operational report of this project for
the month of September lists the following phones

as targets of the operation:204/

in a chronological file.292/ One copy of the Cuban
transcripts was routinely sent to Headquarters on

a weekly basis.293/
(g) Format of Transcripts

The format of the transcripts that Mr. Tarasoff

produced was much the same as those of the Spanish

language transcripts described above.294/ Mr. ~

Tarasoff's transcripts were from Russian into English.295/
Many of Mr. Tarasoff's transcriptions bear the notation
“(previously transcribed)" after the meter number
referring to the reel footage location of a
conversation.297/ Mr. Tarasoff indicated that this
notation meant that the conversation had already been
transcribed from a.tap on another embassy phone:

“Previously transcribed" means, for instance,

I went to the embassy first and the embassy
number was 605055. Now this number 501264
belonged to the film's office. So consequently
if that particular call went out of the main
building to the filiis office and it had been
transcribed before, that is exactly what I
would do, put down "previously transcribed".

So there was no question of doing it twice.298/

Q: Had the information concerning Oswald's visit
to the Cuban Embassy in addition to the Soviet
- one, that Oswald had been requesting a visa,
if it had been sent to CIA headquarters, would
his case prior to the assassination have been
handled in any different manner?

A: It would have been in the case of dissemina- -
tion of information about him, but I do not
think that any opérational action would have
taken to apprehend him or to contact him or
to try to force him back to the United States.

Q: ...how would the dissemination have been
treated differently?

A: Well, it simply means that we would have dis-
seminated any additional information that we
got. 657/ : :

It cannot be determined with exactitude whether or

not this additional information about Oswald was reported
to Headquarters. In all likelihood it was not. The Chief
of the Mexico Desk was asked whether or not the Station
was ever criticized for this failure to report in the
face of a specific request to do so by CIA Headquarters.
He said: i

Ko. That was not because we were trying to go

easy on them, it is simply because it is in the

nature of the business. What you are trying to

do is engage, as I used to say, in important il-

Tegal manipulations of society, secretly.

charming and interesting gentleman. The meeting with him went much better than | had hoped, but it was also rather emotionally
distressing for hoth Jeremy and |. Mr. Whitten broke down several times during the meeting and was obviously feeling very scared.
Although Jeremy is sure that the Board will do the right thing here, we both agreed that Mr. Whitten is without doubt someone who

SUBJECT: Interview with John Whitten (S)

1. On 22 April 1996, from approximately 1000 to 1600,
Jeremy Gunn, General Counsel of the JFK Revi Board, and I spoke
with Mr. John Whitten at the U.S. embassy | Gunn
conducted the interview by showing Whitten v. jocuments and

‘his prior testimony before the HSCA. Mr. Whitten was eager to
help the Board in any way he could and even offered to come to
the US if need be. Gunn concluded that it would probably not be
useful to take Whitten's deposition at a later date. Although
Whitten had in general a good memory, Gunn felt he did not add
anything of significance to his prior testimony before the HSCA.
After the interview, Mr. Whitten took us to his apartment and
then later to a restaurant with his wife. We left Mr. Whitten
about 1900. (S)

2. Mr. Whitten was extremely worried and upset about the
release of his name and on several occasions in the interview was
on the verge of tears. Although I was expecting him to be angry
, with CIA and thé Board, instead, he clearly felt hurt and
betrayed. His obvious physical problems add_to this feeling of
being vulnerable. Physically he is not well; he is paralyzed on
‘his left side and has great difficulty walking. On a map, he
pointed out his apartment and indicated what he believed to be
serious threats to his safety should his affiliation with CIA

fe) own. Within a block of hii artment, hi inted ou

several occasions, should his affiliation own, he would
have to leave On other occasions, he stated that he
would turn himseIf in to the jauthorities and offer his
services as a consultant to the police or intelligence service.
He obviously was extremely distraught and was voicing what he
believed were his options should his name be released by the
Board, although he had not decided on a particular course of
action. On the other hand, Mr. Whitten was adamant that no
matter what happens he would never betray the CIA by telling
anyone about his work as an intelligence officer. (S)

5. By the end of the evening, Mr. Whitten stated that he
felt much better about the state of events. On several occasions,
I had assured him that CIA was doing everything. to protect him
and Gunn had. stated he would argue for his protection to the
Board. He clearly looked upon Gunn and I as his allies in this
process and even stated that he had a "wonderful" day talking to
us. We left him, I believe, feeling happy and confident all would
turn out well. (8S)

6. After our meeting with Whitten, I spoke with Gunn
about how this issue would be handled by the Board. Gunn
believed that it was more than likely that the Board would agree
to protect him and that he would make the strongest argument he
could to them. The Board will make its decision in it's next
meeting in mid-May. Gunn did not think it would be necessary for
; anyone from CIA to come down to that meeting. We agreed that
should the Board make the reprehensible decision of releasing
Whitten's name, that we could not imagine a stronger case on
which to bring an appeal to the President. (S)

Subj: Ex-CIA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire

Ex-CiA Agent Adds Fuel to Kennedy Assassination Fire
By Michael Dorman
(c) 1996, Newsday

The chief CIA investigator of President John F, Kennedy's assassination has
testified that another high CIA official - noted for seeking conspiracies -
disobeyed orders in repeatedly conferring with the Warren Commission shortly
after the murder. The witness also said a colleague once told him that the CIA
official, the late

James Angleton, “has ties to the Mafia.”

Almost 33 vears after the assassination, the identity of the witness, who held
various top-secret CiA jobs, is considered so sensitive that federal authorities
insist on withholding his true name. He is Known only by the alias “John
Scelso.”

While Scelso testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in
1978, his 192-page testimony was kept secret until now. It has just been sent to
the National Archives by the Assassination Records Review Board, a federal
agency that screens assassination documents and makes public those that do not
endanger national security.

Sceiso’s testimony, which critictzed operations of the CIA, FBI, Secret Service
and other agencies, likely will renew debates, especially among conspiracy
theorists, on the assassination and how {t was investigated.

When Kennedy was assassinated on Nov, 22, 1963, Scelso was chief of aClA


13-00000

10/8/1996 America Online: Dick Kevar Page 1

branch

responsible for operations in Mexico and Central America. Richard Helms, the CIA
chief of clandestine services and later the agency's director, placed Scelso in
charge of the assassination investigation. Angleton, a counterintelligence
official with close ttes to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, “immediately went

into action to do all the investigating,” Scelso testified, criticizing the

move sharply.

“Helms called a meeting at which Angleton and a lot of others were present and
told everybody that | was in charge and that no one should have any

conversations with anyone about the Kennedy case without my being present -
which was violated from the word ‘go’ by Angleton, who dealt with the FBI and
the Warren Commission and (Warren Cornmission member and former CIA Director
Allen) Dulles himself, .. Angleton ignored Helms’ orders. | tried to get Helms

to make him obey and Heims said, You go tell him.’ ”

Angleton, who died in 1987, spent much of his career searching for conspiracies
- belfeving that there was a Communist mole in the CIA - and was presumed by
other CIA officers to have tried to press a conspiracy theory on the warren
Cornmission. The commisston found no evidence of a conspiracy. Angleton. was
fired

in 1975. Years later, a mole was found - Aldrich Ames - but he had entered the
CIA after Angleton’s dismissal.

At one point in the 1978 House testimony, committee attorney Michael Goldsmith
asked, “Do you have any reason to belfeve that Angleton might have had ties to
organized crime?”

“Yes,” replied Scelso, who 1s now retired and lives abroad, government sources
said, He sald the Justice Department once asked the CIA to determine the true
names of people holding numbered bank accounts in Panama because the Mafia was
hiding Las Vegas “skim” money there. “We were in an excellent position to do
this and told them so - whereupon Angleton vetoed it and said, ‘That is the
bureau's (FBI's) business.’ Scelso sald he discussed the situation with

another CiA officer. “And he smiled a foxy smile and said, ‘Well, that's

Angleton’s excuse. The real reason 1s that Angleton himself has ties to the

Mafia and he would not

want to doubie-cross them.’ ”

On another subject, Scelso gave Kennedy conspiracy theorists a slight plece of


13-00000

10/8/1996 America Online: Dick Kovar Page 2

ammunition. A Soviet defector, Yuri Nosenko, was Known to have told
investigators. that Lee Harvey Oswald - Identified by the Warren Commission as
Kennedy's assassin - was not a Soviet agent, But Scelso said: “| later heard
that Nosenko was discovered to have been dissembling, not being on the level.
That information was imparted to me by CIA officers.”

Based on the information CiA headquarters had on Oswald before the assassination
- chiefiy that he had been in the Marine Corps and defected to the Soviet Union,
then returned - Sceiso said he saw no reason to pay him special heed. “Oswald
just seemed to me to be a small-potatoes defector,” he said. But he conceded

that significant information about Oswald - known to CIA agents in Mexico City,
for example - had not reached headquarters before the assassinatton.

It dealt chiefly with Oswald's visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in
Mexico City and his attempts to obtain a Cuban visa two months before the
assassination. Scelso said the information failed to reach Washington because of
simple overwork and bureaucratic delays in the Mexico City office. He revealed
that all the outside telephone lines at the Soviet and Cuban embassies were
tapped by American agents and that calls Oswald made to them were recorded.
After Oswald was arrested, Scelso revealed, agents compared audiotapes made
while he was in custody with the wiretaps and determined that he was the same
man who had visited the embassies.
