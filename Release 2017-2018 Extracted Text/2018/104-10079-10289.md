achieve a major technical. p. ion of the PBRUMEN Znbassy in
Mexico City (see also MEXI-2235 dated 20 January 1965, for

in this recruitment and the subsequent ticklish egent-handling of
the subject is to be commended.

LIMITED

1) As noted in paragraph 2, Section b of Reference, the LIMITED
photographic, surveillance, and radio dispatching activities vere
suspended in late September 196 due to the release of LIMITZD
photographs in the Warren Comission's overt report. ; The Station
subsequently acquired an apartment in the immediate vaeinity of

the LIMERICK installation and moved the LIMITED basehouse keepers,
LIEMPTY-6 and LIEPTY-7, into this temporary location, All LIMITED
operational activities vere then re-initiated fron the new basehouse
in early January 1965 and during that month LIMITED produced 18 rolls
of 35 mm operational film, provided reguler physical surveillance
reports, and served as the fixed radio dispatch base for one
LIEMBRACE surveillance operation,

2) Daring the interim period and as « result of separate correspondencd
with Headquarters, the former LIMITED basehouse and property was sold
to LIMOSINE, who as per formal agreement with the Stetion, demolished
the old structure and begin construction of a nev edifice in the
immediate future. Tne: in this formal egreenent with LIMOSINE i

uded
the proviso that one floor of the new building will be
ion of the nev structur

the Station's use. Upon comp:

rsonnel and operational activity will be transferred from the
mporary apartment basehouse.to the new, more ideally located
LIMOSDY building.

LILYRIC - Throughout the period unter review, the LILYRIC installetion
continued to provide photographie and fixed visual surveillance of the
front of the LIMERICK instellation. LILYRIC provided 63 rolls of
operational photograpiis during this period which were of definite
value to the Stations KUDESK operations against the LIMERICK target.
LILYRIC made specific contributions to the Station's LIOYSTER-1
operation, as noted in MEXIm173 of & November 196),

LICALLA - During the period under review, the LICALLA installation
provided coverage of the back of the LIMERICK installation, the

arden, and 7 area where msny of the persomel congregate, LICALLA
provided 60 rolls of 35mn stilt photographs as well as_600 fest of

SECURITY AND PROBLEMS,

a) During the period under review, there have been no known incidents
which adversely effected the security of Project LIEMPIY. However, as a pre-
cautionary measure, the LIENIRAP photographic unit was repainted (a basic color
change) in January 1965. It is belioved that is action will increase the
security of the LIENTRAP unit and allow it to again operate in various areas
where it had been used extensively in the p

onal, personnel, or administra:
riod.

b) There have been no major opera’
problems in this Project during %

5. PLAN

a) During the past project year, many of the operational assignments,
levied on Oliver G.-SCANTLING, vhile within the realm of the Station's RMD,
have fallen outside the scope of Project LIEMPTY. Consequently, a new Project
Outline is being prepared at the Station to cover the relationship with, and
the present and anticipated operational activities of SCANTLING,

in the LIMITED installation/activities were out-

‘tive changes contemplated for Project LIEMPTY.
