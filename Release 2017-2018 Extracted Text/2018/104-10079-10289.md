•4. SECURITY AND PROBLEMS.

a) During the period under review, there have been no known incidents

which adversely effected the security of Project LIE PTY.

However; as

a pre-

cautionary measure, the LIENIRAP photographic unit was repainted (a basic color

change) in January 1965. It is belioved that this action will increase the

security of the LIENTRAP unit and allow it to again operate in various areas

where it had been used extensively in the past.

b) There have been no major operational, personnel, or administrative

problems in this Project during the reporting period.

5. PLANS.

b)

lined in paragraph 2, Section

c above.
