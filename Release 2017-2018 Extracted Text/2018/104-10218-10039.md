CONTINUATION OF caseinrcanion DWSPATON SYMOOL AND MUMOCR
DISPATCH SECRET FMUW-11518

c. Many of the activities contemplated in LIHUFF
are already fully covered by other operations of the
Station. LIHUFF would not contribute enough beyond the
overlap to be justified.

d. The Project would tend to put too much reliance
on conservative olemente, around whom we have already
built a sizeable proportion of our program in Mexico.
Headquarters does not wish to expand further our involve-
ment with these elements.

e. We have noted, in both LIHUFF and LISIREN, the
reluctance of Mexican busineszmen to contribute to anti-
communist programs because they cannot deduct the contri-
butions from their income taxes. As a matter of principle,
we are moved to ask why ODYOXE funds should be spent in
any program--whose primary objective, after all, is to
preserve the capitalistic system under which these
Mexican industrialists hold and increase their affluence-~
if those who will benefit most materially and most
directly from it are unwilling to contribute without
gome recompense. Should the PBPRINE taxpayer assume
the burden of helping those who are unwilling to share
that burden? We feel he should not when he bears such
a heavy burden all around the world.

3. ‘he lack of a formal project relationship would not
prevent the Station from using the LIHUFF organiztion from
time to time on a targets-of-opportunity basis, as has been
done in the past. In such cases the Station could use its
D& TO funds. This use should be limited, and the outlay
of funds should be minimized as much as possible.

4. The contribution of Station funds for the publication
of Identity A may continue to the end of FY 63. Beginning
1 July 1963 we would like the Station to phase out this
expense at whatever rate seems most suitable, but the phase-
out should be completed by 31 December 1963. Further contri-
butions cannot be authorized beyond that date.

5. Please inform us of the Station's intentions regarding
LIHUFF-1. He can be kept as a cutout to LEINUFF, but with the
curtailment of KUBARK's connection with LIRUFF, his services
will not be used enough to justify the salary that has been
proposed. The Station may either reduce his salary or use
him more fully on other operations in order to justify it
The latter, of course, is contingent on his suitability:
in terms of security considerations, his aptitude for certain
types of operations, his own preferences, time available, and
s0 on---to serve other cperations. If the’ Station cannot make
profitable use of LIHUFF-1 in other operations, it may termin-
ate him at its discretion. If the Station plans to keep
LIHUFF-1, he should be placed under a project as soon as his
operational use is determined. If it is not feasible to put
him under the project that he will be working on, then a
separate project should be written to cover him.
