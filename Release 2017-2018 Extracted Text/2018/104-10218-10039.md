REF: EMMA-20931, 02 March 1963

1.

The LIHUFF Project has

been

studied fully and

thoughtfully by IH Division, including a revier by Oliver

G. GALBOND.

It has also been discussed with the KUHOLE

Staff officers who revier such projeots for approval.

After thorough consideration, it is the consensus in

Headquarters that this project will not be approved.

.2.

The reasons for tiris decision are several:

The LIHUFF organization has sources of funds

other than KUBARK and would conduct its activities

without support from KUBARK.

A project to fund the

organization is therefore unpecessary.

several members of the killing organtzation ane

also members of the wastrel organization.

recently discussed the LISIREN operation with Thomas

A. BRENT in Headquarters and is under no illusions about

ODYORE Lunds, if not KUBARK funds, going into the

LISIREN operation.

Moreover, the

similarity of funding

nechanisms between MISIREN and LIHUFF, the similarity of

operations, and other such parallels would, for a think

ing Mexican, be more than coincidence and

would eventually

rOb LIHUFF

of any cover that it might have. The potent.tal

security probiga is not justified."

c. Many of the activities contemplated in LIHUrT

are already fully covered by other operations of the

station.

LIlUff would not contribute enough beyond the

overlap to be justified.

d. The Project would tend to put too much rellance

on conservative olemente, around whom we have already

built a sizeable proportion of our program in Mexico.

Headquarters does not wish to expand further our involve

ment with these elements.

We have noted, in both LIFt and LISIREN, the

reluctance of Mexican busineszmen to contribute to anti

communist progrums because they cannot deduct the contri

butions from their income taxes.

As a natter of principle,

we are moved to ask why ODYOKE funds should be spent in

any program--whose prinary objective, after all, is to

preserve the capitalistic system under which these

Mexican industrtalists hold and increase their affluence-

if those who will benefit most materially and most

directly from

it are unwilling to cortribute without

sOme recompense.

Should the PBPRIME taxpayer assumo

the burden of helping those who are unwilling to share

that burden?

We feel he should not when he bears such

& heavy burden all around the world.

The lack of a formal project relationship would not

prevent the Station from usiag the LINUE organiztion from

time to time on a targots-of-opportunity basis, as has been

done in the past.

In such cases the Station could use its

D & TO funds.

This use should be limited, and

of funds should be minimized as much as possible.

The contribution of Station funds for the publication

of Identity A may continue to the end of FY 63. Beginning

1 July 1963 we would like the Station to phase out this

expense at whatever rate seems most suitable, but the phase

out should be comploted by 31 December 1963.

Further contri-

buttons cannot be authorized beyond that date.

Please inform us of the Station's lotentions regarding

LIHUFE-1. He can be kept as a cutout to LIHUrE, but with the

curtailment of KUBARK's connection with LIkufF, his services

will not be used enough to justify the salary that has been

proposed.

The Station may either reduce his salary or use

him more fully on other operations in order to Justify it.

The tauto seouts concertant a 1p suite 101 Certain

time available, and

cannot nake

profitable use of LIHUFF-1 in other operations, It nay termin

ate his at its discretion.

If the Station plans to keep

LIKUFF-1, he should be placed undor a project as soon as his

operational use is determined.

If it is not feasible to put

him under the project that he

will be working on, then a

separate project should be written to cover his.
