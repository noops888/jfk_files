ominous spectre of foreign backing. <

1. We would like to take time out in our investigation of the President's
assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.
Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only
major overseas reporter in the case. While this is paptly dictated by the
facts of Lee OSWALD!s life, we have not overlooked the‘xeally outstanding per-
formance of Mexico City's major assets and the spetdy,‘apdeision, and perception
with which the data was forvarded. Here it was;veleyéd within minutes to the
White House, ODACID, and ODENYY. ats

2. Your LIENYOY data, the statements. of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses
were major factors in the quick clarifi¢ation of the case, blanking out the really

E .s
3. We regret that we have boatt able to send you so Little information in

return, but we have not been-givépiiuch yet. We do know that Lee OSWALD denied
he had ever been to Mexiegiexckpt for a jump to Ta Juana, We have quickly
sereened the FBI reportyon:tie”whole case but we do not yet have a copy for
retention. It does n igppronice your sources. Basically, vhat the New York
Times has printed cont fe report is all true.

3. We have meanvhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO
story was the most troublesome. They are still coming in.

DISPATCH

4, You have had good support from your liaison, but as usual the really
outstanding features were Mexico Station's famous zeneralship and the skill and
devotion of its personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,
down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work
your Station did during the President's 1962 visit made you feel this tragedy

with particular keenness, as did we.
