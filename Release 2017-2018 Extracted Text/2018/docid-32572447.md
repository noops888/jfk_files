ME was formerly a CI of the Miami Office. It
“was necessary to, discontinue him as such for reasons previously:
furmished the Bureau and no change has come about whereby Miami
recommends ‘consideration be given to him as a CI. It is recom-
mended that”any information he may desire to furnish be ob-
tained from him, however, the same not sought inasmuch as it

is believed MEROLA would use this to his own advantage and to
the embarrassment of the Bureau at a subsequent time.

(Priority or Method of Mailing)

On the night of 8/17/61, MM 722-C, who is a close

associate of MEROLA and who is a close associate of one MEL

ADLER, who is an associate of MEROLA, advised he had been

j informed by MEROLA and by ADLER that MBROLA has been stating

that he will not have to serve any time in the case entitled
"STUART SUTOR, Et Al; ITSP;/TGT; FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY."
MERCOLA has stated that the matter has been taken care of in
Philadelphia and it has cost him a "tremendous bundle" to
have his pending five year sentence suspended and have him
placed on probation. He has indicated this will transpire
next Thursday or Friday, on the 24th or 25th of August,

when he was supposed to start serving his sentence. He
allegedly is to appear before the Federal Judge in Pittsburgh
at that timé to be placed on probation.

MEROLA is presently a top jewel thief of the Miami
Office, and is known to be, and has admitted-to the Pittsburgh
Agents, that he pulled the major theft this last winter at
the Hofbrau Haus in Hallandéle, Fla.

Miami requests the Bureau give authority to
Pittsburgh to inform the Federal Judge at Pittsburgh concern-
ing statements made by MEROLA., These are namely, that he has
spent a "tremendous bundle” to have his case fixed in Pitts-
burgh to where he will be placed on probation rather than ;
serve his pending five year sentence.
