Tony:

I have gone back and forth with Bob Blakey

on the fully and truthfully language on our general

warrant letter to Stokes. I now believe I have

taken out the worst aspect of the reference of the

word truthfully by placing the sentence in the

last paragraph. In my mind then I can tie the

language to those individuals covered by the

letter who might think that they are under a

secrecy agreement but actually are not and never

had a relationship with us. I also then see it

as the quid for the third paragraph as making

clear that individuals covered by secrecy

agreements who seek our guidance in responding

on sensitive areas will do just that and not

use this discretion to mislead. I am willing to

recommend approval on that basis if it is okay

with you.
