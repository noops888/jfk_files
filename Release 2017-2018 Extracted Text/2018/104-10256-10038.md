4, Reference is also made to a 24 March 1975 memorandum
in the file of the above mentioned former Agency employee, Walter
Josef MACKEM, specifically suggesting MACKEM's recent involve-
ment in paramilitary activities--which would appear to coincide with
the activities of ''Friends of Abaco"--at a place in Georgia, not far
from Atlanta. This memorandum also relates that MACKEM is cur-
rently employed as a private investigator in the Washington, D.C. area,

5. All of the foregoing would suggest thaf\Walter Josef MACKEM

in the| activities of ''Friends of Abaco" and AIM.

6: The Central Investigative Agency, Inc., file also contains
a copy of a cable (IN 304568), dated 11 July 1974, from the Atlanta
DDO/FR Base reporting in substance ‘that information had been received
through the FBI originating with Howard GIBSON (believed identical with
the aforementioned Howard R. GIBSON), that the Washington, D.C. office
7 of the Central Investigative Agency, Inc., had been sub-leased to the
Drug Enforcement Administration and was being used by the Central
Intelligence Agency as an electronic surveillance listening post. GIBSON
claimed that this activity was headed by a Central Intelligence Agency
officer, one CONEEN (phonetic).

C 'N is believed identical with former Staff employee
Lucien \ GONEIN tho was last known to be working with the Drug
Enforcemen Ministration. The file of the aforementioned Walter
Josef MIACKEM reflects that he was detailed by the Agency to the Drug
Enforcement Administration from February 1972 to October 1973; and
that as of September 1973, CONEIN was an associate of MACKEM,

8. It is believed that the employment of former Agency employees
by "CIA" and the backing of "CIA" of the Abaco, Independence Movement
could cause future concern for this Agency.
