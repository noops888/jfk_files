1. The proposal subaitted in the reference is interesting and worth
consideration. Several possible ideas have occurred to us on how
we can mount this type of operation. As yet, however, none of these has
deen worked through sufficiently to prepare & definite plan of action.
Revertheless, it appears to us that any effort that would carry conviction
would have to be based oc detailed knowledge of the “proposed victin's”
habits, movements, and exposures to the public, providing a basis for tin-
fing an attack and selecting a site from vhich an attempt could be mde. In
sioxt, the some information ia needed as would be required if an actual
aseassination attempt vere contexpleted. It would be helpful if sketches
and mapa could be prepared to show routes of travel, time intervals, places
of vantage, aites of police stations, routes of escape, location of safe
sites, primary and alternate means of exfiltrating after the attempt, loca-
tions of sites for caching the weapon and for picking up travel documents.
Buch materials could then be vorked into an operation attributable to the
Chinese Communists by the introduction of suitable Chinese touches, and
would provide documentary support to the prima facie evidence of the funds
ana ities
2. We believe that without the authentication described above, the
combined rumor and “evidence” vill readily be detected as a provocation.
We therefore suggest that you draw together the information described above

and forward it to Headquarters to be processed for use in mounting this
operation.
