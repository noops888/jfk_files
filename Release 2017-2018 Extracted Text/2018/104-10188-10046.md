_LFENVOY Project Amendment

wet

A. Attached for the Station's information and records
is a copy of the LIENVOY Project Amendment request which was
approved on 26 July 1963, raising tho LIENVOY approval by
$23,000 for FY 1964, bringing the total approval for the pre~

sent project year to $70,008,

2. There follows a resume of the pertinent correspondence
concerning this Project Amendment, which resulted from problems
surrounding LIENVOY, LICAPER, Orville R, HORSPALL, Douglas J.
PEINGLASS and Arnold F. AREHART, ‘

‘a. The Station was informed in DIR-35426 dated 26
April 1963 that the Station's original request in IMT.
3380 for replacement of the LIENVOY equipmont was held
up for budget reasons and until the future of the pro~
posed LICAPER unit under Li"“4PO could be determined.

b. The LICAPER Project Outline as submitted with
HMMA-21437 was not submitted by Neadquarters to the ap-
propriate authorities for approval, Instead, Head-
quarters cabled approval in principle of tho proposed
project (see DIR 48559, 20 June 1963), stating that the
LIENVOY Project was being amendod for the new equip-
ment, which would release the old LIENVYOY equipment for
LICAPER, (See HMMW-11678.)

has been used for almost three ycars; and 2) to pro-
vide the new center with wore mobile equipzent, Dur-
ing the approval process, CI Staff commented that it
concurred with the Station's plan to move. the inter-
cept center for the reasons stated, as the project
activity was bound to become of interest to various
opposition elements and the Station was well advised

.to make necessary changes to provide for and improve
on the security of the operation.
