source, A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence
Service until April 1964.

The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of _
Intelligence - DGI) does not make any regular payments to revo-
lutionary groups but pays them only when they have submitted a
plan for revolutionary action (armed struggle) ard kave had it
approved in Havana. Therefore, there is no standard amount, paid
to any one group or disbursed in any one country per month or
year, and if no armed struggle is in progress or being planned,
ro money is given out, Funds expended in Latin America on the
above basis include the following:

Guatemala : During 1963, the DGI paid out about U.S,
$250,000. The Yon Sosa group got about
$200,000 in oneyear for its activities
Gaeluded in the $250,000).

E1 Salvador : In August-September 1963, when the Salvadoran
revolutionaries were preparing for armed struggle,
they received U.S,.$50,000. They used the funds
for propaganda, however, and were not given any
mere because they had, in DGI terms, misused
the money.

Nicaragua : During 1963 the DGI disbursed some U,S.$15,000.
In addition, the professor, who was one of the
liaison officers in Mexico, won a suit for some
damage from a company (perhaps Pan American

Airlines) and was awarded U.S.$30,000, some of
; which he turned over to the guerrillas he
: represented.
