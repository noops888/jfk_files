““Supplemental Data: ESPINOSA flew-Air France from Orly
Airport (confirmed by sachet in pp) on 29 May 65 and on
“~arrival in NYC the same day contacted an INS Agent named
CAVASANJIAN (Phonetic) who , on the basis of information

iy the story of ESPINOSA which appeared to affect U.S.
seourity, notified the FBI. Special Agent Frank O'5RIEN
“er the ig Field Office of the FBE*interviewed ESPINOSA aren
<on 2 May 65. The FBI notified us'on 3 May. I saw
"TTT ESPINOSA on . May in the N¥ field office of the FBI. item
Frank O'BRIEN was present. (O'DRIEN said that INS at
Washington, DC apparently had received a report and eee
had notified FBI headquarters frémwhich a supervisor
\~~—had telephoned O'BRIEN to inquire whether O'BRIEN knew

allegations about the CIA, including

Paraphrase of the source's story: I do not have a high
*pegard for the GIA sr for most of “the exiled Cubans but
I am againat the Castro regimefor which reason I have
become involved in these mattcr about which I must be
sure the CIA is informed. I contacted the INS and the ei
FBI because through them I could ensure contact with a :
“-Pesponsible CIA officer. moot cetera

I was a good friend of Rolando CUBELAS. We conspired ese
» together againat BATISTA and we planned assassinztions 7
of Batista supporters. We carried out the killing of
one of the SIM chiefs, RiG@-Gatan, successfully-. A lot
‘tho things the the, anti-HATISTA students did were not
ffective but we did more than talk and this old

i he is working for the CIA in Paris. This letter in Fay was

i . pretty. confusing but Luis made it clear. that there was asseateaues

t something very important, that it involved Rolando CU3ELAS, satan

g that Rolando wanted me to go to Paris on an urgent matter,

I got cauht when I tried to bomb Cuba, the INS had warned
me not to travel outside the U.S. saying I gould go to jail
for five years and + could not get a reentry permit and all
