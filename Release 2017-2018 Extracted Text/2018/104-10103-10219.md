guerrilla situation in Bolivia, and he was given a refresher
‘course in communications. Mizones and were told

that there were strong indications that Guevara was leading
the guerrillas. Among the instructions given them was a clear
one that in the event that the Bolivian Army captured Guevara,
they should do everything possible "to keep him alive."

forces in: Santa Cruz.

officers, although they were known as foreign advisors to a
number of Bolivian officers... (Mizones said that he learned later

that the J ican Ambassador had prohibited anyone other than
he and from becoming involved in the anti~guerrilla
activi e field.)

7.° Despite their apparent status as Bolivian officers,
* Mizones said that they never were given orders by higher-
ranking Bolivian officers (One exception to this rule was the
order which Colonel Zenteno issued to Mizones on the day of
Guevara's execution, if Mizones story is to be believed.)

8. Mizones was assigned to Santa Cruz anf eas
assigned to La Esperanza, where the latter con of

the intelligence training. -As time went by, Mizones' own
duties gravitated to becoming basically those of an advisor.

He said that his case officer was aware of and a] this
development. - Among the things which Mizones and

attempted to accomplish was the preservation of the Lives of-
captured guerrillas, for the collection of intelligence about
the guerrilla's locations, as well as for humanitarian reasons.
Mizones said that he: saved the life of Jose Castillo Chavez,
traveling for that purpose to Vallegrande from Santa Cruz,
where he spoke briefly to Castillo at the Nuestra Senora de
Malta Hospital. At this time Mizones. learned of the intent

of Colonel Selich of the Rangers, to have the prisoner executed.
Mizones prevailed. on Major Saucedo and General La Fuente to
take his side. The prisoner was flown to Vallegrande where
Mizones covered all medical costs and tarried out a two-week:
interrogation. The resulting twenty-page interrogation report
‘provided the Bolivians- with a complete concept of the
.guerrilla's strategy, which turned out to be the key to
Guevara's capture, according to Mizones. -This report was
attributed by the Bolivians to be from their own people.

9. This important development was followed. by an
encounter in late September between a unit led by a Lt. Galindo
and the remnants of the guerrillas. . During this action, a Cuban
lieutenant named Miguel;°-the Bolivian Coco Peredo}; and a
Bolivian physician named Jose Gutierrez Ardaya were killed.
Mizones travelled by jeep to Pucara, where. the bodies were .

* located, and through the information he had learned from

Castillo, he was able to establish that the men were from
Guevara's, forward element. Upon his return to Santa Cruz,
Mizones advised Colonel Zenténo that the 2nd Ranger Battallion
should be immediately deployed, with the remaining two weeks
of their training cancelled. Zenteno accepted this advice:
and the Rangers were moved to Pucara, and the Headquarters of
the Eighth Division were moved to Vallegrande. Mizones
continueé in-his advisory role, suggesting ‘areas for troop
deployment as well as the deployment of the intelligence
.teams. On the 8th of October, contact was established with ©
Guevara's remai; Ss. (At this time Mizones was in —~
Vallegrande aah elporaten. On the 8th, Major
Saucedo reporte radio that "the chief" had been
captured. Mizones then flew over the area in a PT-6 carrying
with him a PRC-10 radio with which he was able to communicate
with the Bolivian forces. He then confirmed that Guevara was -
"the chief" who had been captured. He returned to Vallegrande
where he told Col. Zenteno that Guevara had. been wounded and
captured.


10. That day Major Selich was sent to Higueras to
interrogate the guerrilla prisoners and assembled the
captured documents. Since Colonel Zenteno was- planning to Ely
by helicopter to Higueras on the 9th, Mizones.asked him on
the evening of the 8th if he could accompany him to interrogate
Guevara. Zenteno consulted his staff and agreed. (The 7
helicopter had room only for a pilot and ti EN ger
Mizones prepared a 100-word message to the
in code reporting Guevara's capture and asking an. Embassy
representative be sent to the area to prevail ‘upon the tae

:Bolivians to spare Guevara's life, since he did not believe

that he could succeed in doing so. This message was prepared
for the scheduled 10 a.m. transmission of 9 October, .and

was not transmitted to the relay point in Asuncion, Paraguay,
until about 10:30 a.m., ‘after Mizones arrived in Higueras
and set up his radio transmitter an RS-48.

li. Zenteno, Mizones and the pilot, Nino de Guzman; set
out by helicopter from Vallegrande at 7:15 a.m. on the 9th,

- and arrived in Higueras’at about 7:40 a.m. Mizones accompanied

Zenteno and Major Ayiroa when they visited Guevara in the
school room.which was his improvised’ jail. Guevara would

not answer Zenteno when spoken 4 to.. He was deca hand and Gude
and had a leg wound.

12. Mizones and Major: Selich then reviewed the captured
documents and Mizones obtained permission from Selich to
photograph all the papers, including Guevara's diary, and also
Selich's permission to retain the original aeons tee
addresses found.

- 13. While Zenteno and all the other Bolivian officers
(with the exception of a Lieutenant Perez) were outside -of
the village attending to other military affairs, Mizones
remained.in Higueras as the highest ranking "Bolivian officer".
In this capacity he answered a’call received on the military

field telephene and answered as Captain He was given
the code numbers 500 and 600 as orders’ ere to be
implemented by command of "higher: authorities". He said that

the connection was not.clear and he could not recognize the
voice but it could have been that of Major Saucedo. In any
case, Mizones said that.since it was a line only available
to the military he was confident that it was. order re-
transmitted through military channels. He said that he knew
that 500 referred to Guevara, 600 to the word execute and

. 700 to the preservation of Guevarra's life. These simple

codes had been identified to him previously.



14. .Upon Zenteno's return, Mizones told him of thé
message and Zenteno took it as an authentic order and made
no. effort to have it confirmed. Mizones asked if Guevara's
life could be preserved since he had these instructions.
Zenteno replied that his own position would be placed in
jeopardy if. he did not comply. Mizones asked him to make. -
the attempt anyway. (Mizones believes that Zenteno had .
already resigned himself to the inevitability of Guevara's
execution.) . Zentena said that he was in sympathy with Mizones'
wish but that it was not in his power to reverse the order. -
He told-Mizones that he was well aware of the treatment which
Fidel had meted out to Cubans and told him to execute Guevara
in any manner which he might choose. Zenteno said that he’ -
‘had’ to leave for Vallegrande at 10:00 a.m. and would sénd
a helicopter back to pick up Guevara's'body" at 2 p.m., and
"asa friend", asked that the body be ready. Mizones
reiterated his request that the order. be appealed and Zenteno
agreed to make the attempt, and said Lag would advise if he
were successful.

: 1s. - Failing a counter- manding. of the order and as the
senior "Bolivian officer" left in Higueras, Mizones said he
was left with the implementation of. the execution. After ©
Zenteno left, Mizones was able’ to talk to Guevara, who

_identified.Mizones either asa Puerto Rican or a Cuban

‘working for U.S. intelligence. He said he made this judgment |
on the basis of the questions asked and on Mizones' accent.
While. Mizones was: with Guevara, shots were fired in adjoining.
rooms and Mizones later determined that these involved the_
execution of two other prisoners. Recognizing these shots
for what they were, nevertheless, Guevara blanched when
Mizones confirmed that he too would be executed; although
later. composing himself. :

16. After leaving Guevara, Mizones ‘told a sergeant ‘of
the order to execute Guevara and entrusted the mission to him.
He was told to fire below the head. The ofder was given to
the sergeant at 1:00 p.m. ‘and Mizones heard the shots fired
‘at Guevara at 1:20 p.m. At 2:00 p.m., the helicopter returned
to Higueras. A Father Shiller performed the last rites and
Guevara's remains were strapped to one of the helicopter's
skids and Mizones accompanied them to Vallegrande, where .
they landed at 2:30 p.m. “Mizones said that he lost himself

in the crowd gathered at the airport, but that |
| took charge of the remains and was photographed.
izones said that the title of the photograph, which appeared
in the press, gave an incorrect identification of
the name Mizones used,



: 47. Mizones said he reported the executions to Major

Saucedo and the Chief of Operations, 4 Major Gutierrez,

and then was taken back to identify the podies of the three
executed guerrillas. They then drove to Santa Cruz: with. the
documents, films and equipment and then flew.to La Paz,
-where Mizones contacted his case officer.’ “He was taken to -
a home where fhe DCOS? and other Americans were priefed by. ast
‘him. ‘Everything which he had been able ‘to retain was turned

_in-then to be carried by 2 special courier to Washington.
Mizones then. flew pack to Santa. Cruz where a C-13 a :

--by General Porter, CINCSOUTH, was to pick ‘him and
up for a ‘flight to the Canal Zone. This plane arrived wr
a flat tire on the 10th or jith. . The U.S. Mission aircraft,

- a €-54, was then flown ‘to Santa Cruz and he @ id (Willolbo)

_ were flown back to La Paz. After overnighting there, another
C-130 carried them to Panama where Mizones was asked to
relate his story to General Porter. After 2 weeks in Panama,
Mizones and Pwere documented as GS-16s so’ that they

could board a over@ cooked military flight to Charlotte,
South Carolina. After their arrival. there, they journeyed
to Miami, where Mizones briefed General Cushman. (Mizones
believes that in both high-level priefings he mentioned his
own personal role in the execution of Guevara. } : :
