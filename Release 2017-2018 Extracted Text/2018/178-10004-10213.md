ACCOMPANIED BY SCOTT Ss. BRECKINRIDGE, JR,, DEPUTY

INPSECTOR GENERAL, ENHO KNOCHE, ASSISTANT TO THE

DIRECTOR, AND GEORGE L. CARY, LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL

Mr. Colby. I have an answer to a few of the questions
that were raised at the meeting the other day and there are a
couple of clarifications I woulg like to make.

One, with’ respect to the security investigations in the
United States. The guestion Was asked whether we ever used
private investigators, and I said wa normally used our’ own
investigators. We have some relationships with private
investigatory firms which provide cover for our investigators
and, secondly, we have a few firms which we own which are

proprietary if you will, whereby our investicators appzar to

be private.

I said that in the past it is. clear that on occasion we
dia ask for private investigator firms to help us to some
degree, It was usually the one that was giving us cover, and

for reasons of overload we asked them to have their own people
to do a fow of the investigations.

My General Counsel says that this is illegal. Io have a
strong question about its propriety, if not legality, and I
am undertaking to review this matter to see whether we can not

just eliminate that practics antirely, continuing the proprie-

tary and continuing the se of private investigators as cever

But I did want to clarify that. I think °I mentioned it
last time that there have been occasions on which this was
done. ,

Chairman Church. Mr. Colby, would you in connection with
your review of this matter supply the Committee with the spe-
cifics in those cases where the Agency has in fact engaged
private investigators to do Agency work?

Mr. Colby. ‘Iwill certainly try to, Mr. Chairman, 1
confess this may be a tough job to locate every case but I

certainly will do my best.

Chairman Church. Will you provide the Committee the

opinion of your Counsel with respect to the legality of such?

Mr. Colby. TI will. ;

Chairman Church. Such use of private investigators?

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Chairman Church. And then I would ask the staff also
furnish the Committee with a brief on that question so that we
are-fully advised with respect to the law. ,

Mr. Colby. Right.

The second subject, Mr. Chairman. Senator Mondale asked
for our command and control regulations for the approval of |
covert action projects. These were supplied to the staff on
the first of May and are available to the staff.

from the Agency bocause of his involvement in the assassination

plans ‘against Prime Minister Castro. .

The facts are-that in June 1963 he was assigned a

and in February of '67 he was ..-°7*-

reassigned to CIA Headquarters. He retired voluntarily under
our retirement system on 31 of December 1967. ,

If I may, there is a reason why he was taken out and if I
could go off the record and mention that to the Committee. It
is a matter of his privacy.

Chairman Church. Very well, off the record.

(O£E the record discussion)

Mr. Colby. Back on ths record.

Senator Schweiker.asked me whether Howard Hunt or James
MeCord were in charge of Mexican operations at the time of

President Kennedy's assasSination on 22nd of November '63.

- Howard Hunt from “July '62 to August ‘64 was assigned as a
Section Chief in the Division of Plans Directorate, which is
now the Operations Directorate at CIA Headquarters, which had
no responsibility whatsoever for Mexican operations.

Senator Schweiker. What were those dates again?

Mr. Colby. duly "62 to August *64.

Senator Schweiker. Wasn't he at some point in Mexico
City and in charge of that office?

Mr. Knoche. Way back in the '50's he

“City. Way back. Ne was not in-charge.

different subject I would have to explain some day.

Mr. McCord from June '62 to June ‘64 was | assigned asa

point. :

Senator Morgan last time asked what information was given
to the Warren ‘Comnission con ncerning Agency assassination plans
concerning Castro, and I have been advised our records de not
indicate that the Warren Commission was provided with inforna-
tion on this subject.

Allen Dulles, of course, I would note, who was the CIA
pirector until the fall of '61, was a member of the Warren
Commission, but beyond thet fact I have nothing t could offer.

And then who made the decision net to provide. it, if none
was given? ‘our records do not indicate that there was a CIA
decision on this matter not to tell the Warren Commission.

Mr. Colby. Still working with us to help on the transi-
tion of the whole counter intelligence program.

Chairman Church. Why did he retire?

Mr. Colby.. That was the Angleton case, Mr, Chairman, and!

the facts of that case were that I had had some professional
aitterencés in thé organization with mr. Angleton as to the
way the counterintelligence business was run and the way the
Israeli “account was handled. I believed that it required a

higher degree of coordination of the other elements of the

Directorate and of the Agency. We had debated this on various
eceasions in the past. I ‘did x organize that staff in 1973 enr<

_basic decisions. I was going to move the Israeli account fron

over many months and on several eccasions. We could never

really agroea to it because he insisted on the importance of
retaining it where it was.

Mr. Angleton had done a very good job of establishing that,
liaison years ago and knew a lot of the senior Israeili who
were involved in it.

I believed there was inadequate coordinaticn in the Arab
areas.

Also, 1 believed that there was a undue degree of compart
mentation’ o£ that staff, that it needed more interchange with |
our other divisions. We debated this end discussed it and I

set as my time limit for this discussion the end of December |

_ because there were some very substantial retirement benefits

that people would loose if they stayed after that point. Then
unfortunately the Seymour Hirsh article of December 22nd came
to.our Attention before it was actually published, and so I

brought Mr. Angleton up and said that I was going to make two

his control and I was going to put some sucessor leadership
into the Head of the Counterintelligence Staff. I said I woul

offer him a post of tying together some counterintelligence |

doctrine, he could stay we

chose-to retire. I insisted that I talk to him before the
Seynour Hirs~ article appeared.. x knew it was coming. I
didn't know what it was going to say. I wanted to make clear
between him.and me that the decision was based upon our long~
standing discussion of how ‘to run that particular activity.
The question then came up who would be his successor and

Mr. Rocca was his Deputy. ‘There ware two other officers who
were possibilities. One of the officers, Mr. Hood, had said
in early Decenber that he .planned to retire at the end of

December. The other two, Mr. Rocca and Mr. Miler, were informed

that they would not be the successor Chief of that staff, They

were offered a chance to stay on in their then current jobs.
They chose to retire. All four of them agreed to stay with
us on a consultant basis over the next several months to help

us on the transition of new leadership into that job, and they

ron

have done so.
Chairman Church. Well, without getting off the track, I
just have one further question here’ in connection with Mr.
Angleton himself.
Is it true that he is still being paid as a consultant?
Mr. Colby. I believe it has dropped off,- Mr. Chaimuan..
He did help us for three or four months but I believe that it
is terminated. It is abou! time to terminate it, I know, and

whether it is'on this particular date has peor e inated.

Mr. Colby. Absolutely not. It was to help us get over

as

‘and the US for sabotaging the aircraft. The aircraft employee

had fled to Taiwan. We had nothing to do with that incident
and frankly heard about it after it occurred.

In the. fall of 1956, a senior Chinese Nationalist Official

eel

informed an officer of CIA that a Chinese National planned to
assassinate Chou En Lai during his visit to canbodia in
November '56 and had been thwarted by the Cambodian arrest of
the Chinese Nationalist officer sent to, Phnom Penh to supervise
the attempt. We learnea of this after it had happened and we
had nothing to go with it.

We had a relationship with the Chinese Nationalists
Intelligence Service over the years and, they clearly have done
things without our knowledge or involvement, and in a number

of areas, but we have also worked toget

r on some areas.

These are two that were separate.

Also I was-asked to look at the photographs of Howard Hv
and Sturgis that appeared in.Ndwsweek some years ago. We
obthined this photograph from the FBI last night about 5 o'clock.
We had not had it before. We had a copy of the Newsweek
edition. |

We had our photographic experts and analysts and so forth
look at these two individuals here who were picked up. We
examined them in‘ Considerable detail, and talking about the
"61 Hunt photograph, comparing it with this, and this is tha
Photograph Newsweek photograph. You-will see that there is a

lot of sortor fundamental differences in the kinds of -

appearances they have, different characteristics of the
individuals.

With respect to Sturgis, of course, we are not as confi-
dent because we don't have as good a base to work from in cur
comparison but at the same time we see differences there also.

Now, we further leoked, had one of our disguise people --
we obviously have people who can disguise you -= the red wig
elpisode. It wasn't red, they insist, it wasn't ill fitting:
That is the thing thet chey get upset aout. But they say that
it would not be feasible to have them actually in a disguises,
have these individuals-actually in this disguise, that it is
toobig’a jump, it differs.

Senator Huddleston. How about the size of the individual
are they pretty close?

Mr. Colby. These two are. He looks like a shorter man

from the surroundings. And Hunt is about medium height, rath

than this short.

were able to do a pretty good job on unt and, what they do is
identify certain key points, make measurements and put adjust-
ments, the same thing we do for the satellite photography in
terms of these measurements, and things like that, and cenpare
it in that sense, and their conclusion: is that clearly. this is
not Hunt. They are absolutely confident that this photograph
is not. Hunt. They are less confident that it is not Sturgis
because of the base on which they are operating, but they thin
itis not.

I point out that this analysis was done overnight, about
3 o'clock in the morning. This is Sturgis.

Mr. Schwarz. And to the right?

Mr. Colby. This is a newspaper photegraph of Hunt, a
recent one. These are sort of Agency photegraphs of him when
he was an employee.

Senator Hart Of Colorado. Were those men ever identifica
by the Dallas Police?

- Mr. Colby. They must have booked them or something if
they carricd them in. I really don't know. Tf they took them
in I would assume thoy would have had to book them.

They have really done a job if they changed B to that lower
right.

Mr. Colby.” They can change them, honest.

Let me gat my brief on that and I will answer that
question.

They magnified them to the same scale using the eyes and

mouth. The contrast and texture differences were minimized,

continuous tone photographs enployed and angular compensations
were. made to offset errors incident to the different hoads.
Shey can mix them around in that kind of fashion.

Senator Schweiker, It is in the Warren Commission?

Mr. Colby. Yes, it is in the Warren Commission.

Just one additional matter.

Chairman Church. Just one thing I would like to say to

you, Mr. colby, before I forget it. You have made reference
to the Israsli account and the special way that it had been
handled under Mr. Angleton. Before we finish our review with
you of covert operations we would like to have a more detailed
statement of that matter.

Mr. Colby. Right.

discuss ie with us and we will have further questions to ask

investigation?
Mr. Colby. Sure, no problem.

The only other one thing I would like to suggest for tho

attempts made against Mr, Castro, in no way justifying them.
My position on this is quite clear. I do think it important
to put that exercise in the context of the times, which was
the times of the: Bay of Pigs, which was a decision made nie
the Government. "phe Cuban missile crisis, and following that,
a program approved by our normal covert action approval mecha-
nism to try to generate an overthrow of Mr. Castro from within
Cuba by assisting various groups to go in with Sabatage and

by putting economic pressure on the country, and so forth.

That went on for a number of years after the 1961-62 episodes

and toward Mr. Castro that is an important factor in evaluat-
ing the thing, without in any way justifying the particular

attempts to assassinate hin.

Senator Hart of Michigan. But was there any evaluation

Mr. Colby. There was an evaluation done after tke Bay

Senator Hart of Colorado. Is this the understanding we
have had or not?

Mr. Schwarz. at has been a total frustration to the staff
and I em vary happy it has come up here because wa get chased
around ths corner by one agency to another. It is called the
"third agency rule." It was intended to have nothing to do
with Congressional hearings. Obviously, it had to do with
declassificaticn to the public, and it. has happened to completel},
delay our ability to get infornation beacause we go at one agency
and then they determine that it really isn't their documant
or it mentioned some other agency, and then we have to go to
the other agency... :

This is an example of how frustrating it is.

Senator Mondale. Have we tried to get this decument from
the NSA?

Mr. Colby. No; this particular document had just come up

on Wednesday --

Senator Schweiker. Doss the counsel have any suggestions
as to what he feels the Committes position should be in this
area to enable him and staff to do an effective job?

Mx. Schwarz. I think the Comaittee's position ought to be
that pertinent information should be produced by any agency
that possesses it, and if they wish to inform another agency

if I could offer one explanation for the qaira Agency Rule

even in this circumstance. And I.am particularly interested in

this because sometimes our documents have material whose

sensitivity is not apparent on the face and we assumé that this
will be handled in certain compartmented channels, and if it
gets out of the compartment it might give problems that the
individual at the other end wasn't aware of. That is the
basis for the rule. The thought being go back and ask the
originator, and he has a feeling £ for that and could make the
particular case if somathing particularly sensitive is involved

Senator Mondale. It refers to a me sting in Mr. Rusk's

"I called Lansdale's office and in his absence pointed cet

to Frank Head the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this

to were including liquidation ‘of leaders. I advised him as

chairman Church, of course they are crucial and wa must
have them.

The ambiguity, however, that we have yet to clear up is
in the third Paragraph, Senator Mondale, where the Metrorandum
reads the question of assassination, particularly of Pidel——
Castro, was brought up by Secretary NceNamara at a meeting of
the special group dugmantea in Secretary Rusk's office in
August. ‘Te was the obvious consensus at that meeting, in
answer to a comment by Mr. Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject
which has been made a matter-.of official record, the subject

being the question of assassination,

Mr, Colby. Well, I think that you certainly can say that
there is an avoidance by a lot of People of learning things
that they are not authorized to know. Iomean the more loyal
in a sense of our employees, say that they have authority to
know what it ‘going on in, say, Cuba, they don’t have a right
to know what is going on in, say, China, and they rather
carefully keep themselves from learning what is going on in
China. I think that is a prevalence.

I think the question you are asking, however, is whether
we are trying to keep activities off of paper and it is pratty
clear that.the assassination story was essentially kept ort
the paper . .

And I would think that is about the only one. ¥o, the
drug thing. I assume some of that was kept off of papar?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes.

Mr. Colby. fhe lesson that IF have frequently given to
my colleagues in ‘the bureaucracy is that however hard you try
to keep it off of paper, you will not succeed in a bureaucracy,
somebody will write it down and, therefore, it is a totally
feckless exercise to pret. band that you can keep it secret by
not writing it down. But the fact is there were situations
in which a conscious effort was mada in the past to keep things
off the record, ,

This exercise stemmed from tha revelation in Jack
Anderson's columns, I belisve, of our relationship with the
Mafia figurss at that time. This then generated the reques ;
to Mr. Breckiaridge to do an Inspector General's report of
this whole subject, which he did, and which wa will certainly
make available to this Comittes. . :

I will go back to the Cubella case.

. In the instance of the Dominican Republic, the record
was very full then-and it is still very full today. TI am
certain that record is complete.

Again, in the minds of the peopls who were involved, they
drew a line between the support they gave to the coup grovp
and conscious association with essassination as such. Those
records are completa and those records wera developed at the
time and they ware retained. It was in the period of ‘the
Mafia was involved where psople knew the purpose was assassina-
tion. .

The records: are practically non-existent and I believe

they never existed.

Harvey, who conducted the second phase of that, at the
time of our investigation had a handful of cryptic notes that

only he could interpret. We couldn't interpret them. And

it is my understanding that those notes no longer exist. Th

were retgined by him and he brought them in at the time that

we ware questioning him. He was then on sick leave prior to

retirement. whose notes ware totally unrevealing.

, I think that those records are in the same state today

that they wera then. ie

There were none in ths Castro affair except the restits

of our investigation invelving the Mafia.

the time of the investigation we understood he accepted but

I have since’been told he did not accept. It was a ballpoint

Pen converted into a syringe for injecting poison.
Subsequently, arms were handed to Cubella by a Cuban

xefugee in Madrid, in the very early part of 1965, and two

catches were put down by hoats off Cuba for Cubella. I think
he may have recovered one of those but not the other. The
records on that are pretty complste

S6, generally speaking, on those things where the Agency

General.

To.g0 back, how the question arose, and it gces far afield,
John Roselli, who was the Chicago ‘member of the Mafia who
arranged the introduction of Giancana to the Cuban syndicate
head, through.whom they initially tried to run this operation --
Giancana had a personal love affair'with a well know entertainer
who was then in Las Vegas, and she was aispected by him of then
having an affair with another well known entertainer.

Giancana went.to Robert Maheu, through whom these intreduc-|
tions were first made --

Mr. Schwarz. Introduced to the Mafia personnel?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes. ,

Mr. Colby. Between CIA and the Mafia.

Mr. Breckinridge. And asked Maheu toarange to have the
“xoom of the male entertainer in Las Vegas bugged. They hired
a.private cetective who then did this. The roommate sturbled
on the equipment, the private detective was arrested, and the
FBI investigative trail led from the private detective to Maheu

to Gianeana and eventually to CIA. Giancana had insisted that

Maheu help hin because he had helped Mahau with the introduction
to the head of the Cuban syndicate, and Maheu had then agreed

thira member of the syndicate involved in this, botk yf whom
were high on the FAI list, as they progressed towards developing
a pFosecution, they came to Colonel Edwards, the FBI did, and
said what is your position on this. The position of the Agency
as stated by Colonel Edwards was we did not want thom prosecuted
because it would expose what he understood to be this operation,
and I guess the time Sequence gets a little fuzzy in my mind.
Mr. Schwarz. Did he teli the Director of the FBI the

nature of the operation, or simply he told him it would concern

Some sensitive matter?

Mr. Breckinridge. He told him it was an intelligence
operation in country, and the Mafia was being used for that
purpose, So in the discussions as it progressed, it dealt with
the wiretap prosecution. Colonel Edwards in discussing it
with us in 1967, according to our notes, said that they briefed
the Attorney General all the way, but at that time Colonel
Edwards, I think by the time they did it, Colonel Edwards thought;
it was over. So the Attorney General and the FBI were not told
the cOmplete story. 7

Mr. Schwarz. They weren't told the most important part
of tho story, and that was that it was continuing.

Mr. Breckinxidge. They didn't know that, that is correct.

Chairman Church. So you have here two violations of law.

Apart from what was told to the Attorney General, you have two

violations of law. Onc, the wiretap, it was an illegal operation

~ ur. areckinridge. I think that is probably correct. It

was in the fall of 1961 that Mr. Harvey was given this assignment
by Mr, Sissel. I think Mr. Bissel left in 1962, 1 am noi sure
of the dates, So Mr. Bissel would have known at that time.
But I am not sure after that.

Chairman Church. Helms succeeded Mr. Bissel as chief
of operations? :

Mr. Colby. Deputy Director of Plans.

Chairman Church. Deputy Director for Plans.

Your record shows that Helms had knowledge of the 2R Rifle

operation, which, among other things, was to develop an execnuti:

capability -- whatever that means, Presumably that means a
capability to conduct an-assassination if and when authorized
by proper authcrity?
_ Mr. Breckinridge. That is my understanding.
Chairman Church. Is that.your understanding?

Oh
ar. Breckinridge. Yes, sir.

Chairman Church. Do ¥ ar records show that, or is that
based upon what has been revealed through your interrogation?

Mr. Breckinridge. First) Tyee me go back and clarify, then
I will answer this fuestiaa; afr may.

Mr. Helms approved 2R Rifle, which the record showshas the

responsibility of [Cd essentially.

My understanding, from my interviews, is that ZR Rifle had

also the responsibility for executive action eapability. That
is a difficult phrase.
The record does not show that Mr. Ielms knew when he spprovas

2 of

the projest that it had this dual role. so from that po!
view, I have a record that shows what the project was supposed
to have been as far as its open description, though classified,
and the.result of our interviews. with Mr. Harvey which tell the
other story about executive action capability. So it does not,
the record does not show that Mr.Helms at thet time knew what
that was.

Chairman Church. If Harvey knew that it had this other
aSpect, who would have told him to develop such a capability, if
it were not his superior?

Mr, Breckinridge. I think that. is a logical conclusion, but

Iwas distinguishing what the record showed and what our inter

developed.

Chairman Church. Didn't you ask Harvey in interviewing

‘
him whethér or not Helms had told him to develop this capability

as a part of the ZR Rifle?

Didn't, you ask him who told. him to develop this capability,
or did he do it on his own? ,

Mr, Breckinridge. Your question is a very proper one, and
my difficulty is with the record which goes back to what Bissel
instructed Hervey to do.

Mr. Schwarz. Before Helms took the job,-Bissel told Harvey

“Mx. Breckinridge. Bissel told Harvey to create the execut:
action capability.

Mr. Schwarz. But he also told him to take charge of the
Castro assassination project using the Mafia; isn't that
correct?

Mr. Breckinridge. Nov, there is no record except the
xecord that camé from our interviews on this score. All I
am trying to do is draw the distinction between what the record
shows and what our interviews: developed, and there are gaps
in that. , .

Chairman Church. Your interviews show that Mr. Bissel, who
preceded Helms, told Mr. Harvey to develop an executive action
capability, which was a capability to assassinate if. and when
orderad; right?

Mr. Breckinridge. That is correct.

Chairman Church. And your records show that Nr. Bissel
also Anstructed Harvey to take over the Castro assassination
attempt, which was connected with a continuing relationship
between the CIA and the Mafia?

Mr, Breckinridge. JI think that is a correct assumption, -
yes. ,

Chairman Church. Now, when do your records show that Nelms

ue. Breckinridge. I don't have the accurate date. We have
the 16 August 1963 memorandum, £ promised ue. Schwarz that I
would try and find the date, and I was out of town yesterday
and simply didn't do it. But I have to go through the record
to find the earliest date that we have, and I simply have to go
into the record to dig this out.

Senator Schweiker... Do your records show the date of when
the actual latest assassination attempt was finished?

Mr. Schwarz. For Castro?

Senator Schweiker. Yes. When was that timeframe, roughly?

. “yr. Breckinridge. You are talking about the Mafia connectis

. Senator Schweiker. No; I am talking about when did we
finally cease and desist in attempting to assassinate Castro,
from your records? , , _

Mr. Breckinridge. Let me, if i. may, and I don't mean to
confuse the issue -- the Mafia connection from beginning to end
was an attempt to assassinate Castro. The operation was called
off finally in the Spring, perhaps February, of 1963.

Senator Hart of Michigan. What year?

Mr. Breckinridge. 1963. .
Mx. Schwarz. That is the Mafia part? "

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir, The Cuballa Association has a

and in | conversation with Rselli~ Roselli was the man who was
in the Mafia through whom the Agency had continued to work ==
and Roselli agreed that nething was happening, nothing could
happen, and it should be called off. We don't have a record
that Harvey went anywhere for approval. This doesn't mean that
he may not have discussed it, but I don't have the record of it.
So Harvey in his conversation with Roselli, terminated the

operation.
Senator Hart of Colorado. The memo which we saw at the

last session, which I’don't know we officially have, Mr. Colby

made it available to us -- was a wrap-up of the whole thing, ora

memo to the files, and I can't recall now-who did it.

Mr. Schwarz. That is the one referring to the meeting
with Robert Kennedy that we spent some time leoking at.
Senator Hart of Colorado. That was the Sheffield-Edwards

memo which say with the collapse of the Bay of Pigs invasion
operation, no further attempt was made with the Mafia. It tied

it directly to the Bay of Pigs,

Me. Colby. That was the first phase, There was a second

hase that followed with the Mafia.

Mr, Colby. I think at that time he was either head of the
Cuban forse or Chief of the Weste.n Homisphere Division,

Chairman Church. will you get that for the record?

Mr, Colby. Yes, sir,

Mr. Breckinridge. The decision was taken to try and give
Cubella some instrument, A ball point pen was designed that
could be used as a syringe. Because Cubella was a aector, the
pen was given to him in Paris on the 22nd of Hoverber, 1963,
with the suggestion that he use it,

Chaisman Church, By whon was the pen given?

Me. Breckinridge. It was given by a case officer of the

Agency. In fact, Cubella refused to take it. When we wrote our

report, we thought he accepted it, but I've since le;
refused it. He said it was not practical.

Because he was a doctor it was Suggested that he could
acquize the material to put in the pon, but he refused to accept
it. - ,

Conversations continued, and finally the.Agency arvanged
to put down two caches at Sea off the coast of Cuba, one of
waich had weapons in it, one of which had just general equiprené.

Senator Schweiker. Could either of those involve the Story

that appeared in the press under Colonel Prouty's’ statement?

Mr. Nnoche. Prouty's allegations go back to 1959,

Senator Schweiker, What?

Mr. Knoche. 1959, late 1959 ana early 1960,

Mr. Breckinridge. We arranged to have a Cuban refugee
leader meet Cubella in Spain, at which time he gave him an
additional weapon. That would have been in February of 1964,

I think, -
Chairman Church, What kind of weapon was given to him?
Mr. Breckinridge. at is my recollection it was a rifle,

T am not sure of that. =

Cubelila continued to have conversations and meetings from

time to time as he came out of Cuba, and finally in the middie

of 1965 the decision was taken to cut eff contact with him
beaause there were serious guestions about the security of his
organization.

Ne was arrested, I think. I think I have gotten my dates
right. It is subject to correction, He was arrested in the
early part of 1966 and tried, made a confession, had a public
trial, which was reported in the press,

I wonder if I might check those dates?

explain how it was during this period that Cubella was able
to retukn to Cuba and travel to Europe,

I assume he was able to return to Cuba?

Mr. Colby. We-was a Cuban officer at that time, and
apparently loyal to Castro. He would go out on various trips
and things like that, and we would meet him there.

Mr. Schwarz, He was the man who met with Mr. Hunt in
Madrid?

Mr. Colby. “He met with a friend of Mr. Hunt. a Cuban exii
met Cubella in Madrid. That is when the weapons were handed
over.

Hr. Schwarz.- Was Mr. Hunt in Madrid at that time?

Mr, Colby. Yes, -

Mr. Breckinridge. No, because this man by the nane of
Artimo, met Cubella in. Madrid in December of 1964, and in
February 1965 he made the Gelivery of the weapons. Hunt was
not’ assigned there until the middle of 1965, after this was
over. We,don't know where thet story came from.

Mr. Colby. Hunt and Artino are very close, and he is ‘the
godfather of one of their children, and things like that. He
may have told him about it.

when these various contacts were made with Cubella, who was

The point at which they began to provide weapons to hin
should have required higher level approval. I don't know what
the level of approval was, ,

Mr. Schwarz. Tt should have under the normal procedu~es?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir. .

Chairman Church. At one point a meeting took Place and an
agent of the CIA gave him a balipoint pen that had been special
designed to camouflage a syringe, and gave it to him with the
recommendation that it would be filled with poison and used to
kill Castro.

-Are you saying that the agent may have done this without
the Knowledge « of the Director or the Deputy Director for Plans,
someone high in the Agency? ‘ 7

Mr, Breckinridge. No; I am saying there should have been

authorization, I don't know the level of that authorization,

merely tried to draw a distinction because it is a question

in’my mind, it was raised by Senator Schweiker's question -- when

was the last attempt of assassination?
This developed to the point where assassination was

involved, and this was the last such interest that we know of.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with

ZR Rifle, I think you testified or your associate said this was

a multi-purpose cperation, and the

development of the capability of what euphemistically is called

executive action. H
In your professional judgment, and with your history of

your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you tha

a Major operation, a major intelligence gathering operation of

the sort of

would be mounted under the direction of a man

‘fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination

about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of
something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,

I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?

Does it not suggest to you that was in

opération with unlimited, non-youther financial capability?

Mr. Colby. No, net that it is purely a cover.

Mn the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour
in Bexylin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was
one of our major successful intelligence operations.

Mr. Harvey was a very colorful figure who had his lifestyle,

which is different than sene others, but he had been very

effective at that, and very adventureseme in that category of

gigis intelligence and a very.enturesome idea of .that nature.

as well as this other activity.

Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the SCcond

one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been

discussing. It was not to be put on the record although to be

done, That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,

but to say that thes was only a cover I think is

probably an unwarranted conclusion.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding
of $7,500 to $10,000?

Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of
an operation.
Senator Hart of Colorado, Precisely, I think it is too
little.

Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is

think you can draw much conclusion from the actual number on
the figure one way or the other,
this might net have been the only such project. You know,

an assassination project would cost you more money than that,

too,

Senator Hart of Cclorado. Absolutely,

amount of money involved. I think you ges inte a situation

aspect & the number of dollars. ,

Senator Hart of Colorado. So Nr. Harvey, if the decision
were made to try to liquidate a foreign leader, and Mr. Ba ivey
found the instrumentality, the individual to do that, and that
required $100,000, all he had to do was come back in and say?

Mr, Colby, He could get it.

Mr. Schwarz. I think we should have the record reflect
two things. The two gentlemen talking are not eyewitnesses to
what we havé, been talking about.

second, ang related to that, for us to pursue this matter,
we must have, and'must have right away, the better evidence
which is in the possession of the CIA, which is at least the
Inspector General report of 1967; and more importantly than that,
the interview notes reflecting whatever interviews you had

withthomevéer you interviewed at that time or later. Ve.

Mx. Colby. These we will make available to you to the
extent werhave them. ,

one report that we submitted to Mr, Helms at that time, the one

copy. When he left the Agency he returned it to us,

Now, the files on the Cubella affair and the Trujitieaffai

exist, and they are available,

Mr. Colby. Sure. If we can just have the same sort of
normal ground rules. about the papers.

Chairman Church. Sure. They always apply unless -

Mr. Colby. I know.

Chairman Church. -- unless we say differently.

Mr, Schwarz. No, just following up one more. thing on
Senator Hart's question of some time ago,

Would you determine with respect to five different periods
of time whether, first, there was any internal evaluation

within the Central Intelligence Agency as to whether or ‘not

the assassination attempts should continue and, second, whether
there was any discussions with persons outside of the Central

Intelligence Agency as to whether or not the plot should continue

and the period of time would be the initial authorization, which
vas March 1960, after the Bay of Pigs, during the missile
exisis, And, parenthetically there, will you state whether it
was possible Castro might have been assassinated pursuant to

an ongoing plan during a period of time when . the United States

and Russiz were close to a nuclear ¢onfrontation. The nex
case ig John F.kKennedy's assassination.

Finally, at the time of the break-off in June of 1965,.

which I believe was Mx, Breckinridge's testimony, was anybody in

higher authority told that the cperation had been broken of £?

Because that will bear upon whether anybody in higher authority
had authorized or requested the operation.
Mr. Colby. Yes, fine.
Mr, Cchwarz. Can I pick up then on another subject wich
we just barely touched on last tine, Mr. Colby?
3 This is related to the question I asked you about the use

of criminal elements,

Senator Mathias. Before we leave this, I have one questicn

Chairman Church. Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias. In Light of the fact this poison pen was
actually proffered on the 22nd of November, 1963, is there a
seintilia of evidénce -- and was proffered to a Major in the
Cuban Army en active duty -~- is there a scintilla of evidence
that anyone in the Cuban Governnent had any knowledge or suspicic
prior to that date that this was a project that was planned?

Mr. Colby. There is certainly no evidence that anyone

had that information with respect to the Cubella operation,
“yr, Breckinridge. No.
Mr. Colby, The second phase of the Mafia operation had bee
wrapped up by then, think.
Mr. Breckinridge. Yes.
Mr, Colby. The individual in Cuba involved in it had
take asyluwa, think, uo,
Mr. Breckinridge, No, the sequence is a little cifferent.

j Could have produced allegations of attempts against him with

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes. There were people who reporteidly
were mnt ‘into Cuba, a team of three people -- and I Said reporta:
because we were working then through a Cuban exile leader,

They had the assignment of recruiting additional people to
carry out such Plans as might be devcloped. We never knew what
happened to those people ~~ whether they came back .-- only that
they were sent in.

But if you are looking for a possibility of knowledge of
an assassination Plot, conceivably those three peoole could be
the source of it, but not that the united States Government was
behind it.

Senator Mathias. But it is conceivable that Castro and

his government could have come upon some evidence that some

plot was afoot?

Mr. Colby. He certainly could have cross allegations,

you really must assume that various of the other kind, even

independent activities, or the first phase of the Mafia pros

the comment that CIA or the United States was behind it. The
possibility of that kind of allegation is just almost infinite.

second phase of the Mafia connection for assassination Castro

to Senate.s Mathias.

I wonder if you could complete the record on this second

phase. Give us all the information that you know about that.

Mr, Breckinridge, Befere I do, one additional consideratic

The Cuban exile community in Miami was engaged in a great

deal of plotting of its own and a great deal of hyperbole, and

it is safe to assume that Castro also had xeports of assassinatix

schemes or threats from that group. So there is one more source

to that sort of thing.

~ Mr. Breckinridge. fhe first man who had tha job in the
Of£fica of the Prime Minister, this man did get kickbacks fron
the criminals. I think that must be tha one you remambec. te
took refuge in the Venezuelan embassy and stayed there until
1964. He finally was given safe conduct to pass out. The
Mexican smbassy took over from Venezuela. Cuba broke diplomatic
velations. Ha continusd to be a political refuges in that
embassy until the fall of 1964.

Chairman Church. What was Varona'’s motive for participati

in ths plot?

Me. Breckinridge. Varona was one of the axils leaders
who wanted to overthrow Castro. He wanted mors financing then

he had. He would cocperats with anyons.

Mr. Schwarz. I would like to pick up on the Giscussion
we had. ,

Chairman Church. Mr. Schwarz has five minutes more, and
we will conclude, and I would lik. te ask the Committee cc stay
on for ten more minutes for an exécutive session,

Mr. Schwarz. In the discussion we had on the use of

criminal elements, we have dealt with the Castro operation.

In the middle of the book sipplied to us by Mr, Breckinridge

earlier this week, there is a discussion about the Lurmunbs
TI

operation, and the Agent Q. J. Win,

Now, is it a fact that Q. J. Win was the agent, or asset,

however you would refer to him, who apparently was considered

| for the effort to assassinate Lumumba, which never tock place;

is that right?

Mx. Colby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, is it accurate that Q. J. Win operated
in, Europe trying to spot and assess individuals whon the Agency
coulé.use ‘in safecracking operations?

Mr. Colby. This is what is reported, and it is quite
possible. . ,
c
Nr, Breckinridge, The record indicates that.

Ne. Schwarz, And is it further so that one of the CIA

officers who first met Q. J. Win in Luxembourg, Was on a-

trip averseas to find safeerackers and Gocument suppliers?

Mr. Colby. Yes, that is what it says,

is the OSS the predecessor of the CIA in some sense?

nr. Schwarz. Now, just as a matter of historical record,
Mr. Colby. Yes, sir. . ,
Mr. Schwarz. ‘Is it correct that “Lucky" Luciano was used
to help the: ogs in connection with operaticns in Italy during
the Second World ‘var? , :
Mr. Colby. I don't know, but I have heard that story
as well, It is an extensive story but I don't know the facts.
‘Mr. Schwarz. -For the record, Mr. Luciano was a Mafia
figure who had heen deported from the United States, or was in
jailin the United States?
Mr, Colby. Was in jail, I guess, and was later deported

after the War.

Mr. Schwarz, Now, in connection with the instructions whi
you issued in 1973 concerning activities outside of the Charter i
of the CIA, you received, as we went through the other day, a

report from the Inspector General leading up to that in May of t

1973? . : >

Fag

Mx. Colby. That is right.

Mr, Schwarz. And was part of the report that the era
had itself conducted for local police departments in Washington, }
Arlington, Fairfax and Alemandria, during the pericd 1968 and
1969, a series of classes in items which included basics in

surveillance, photography, :Dasic audio and countersabotage;: and |

in addition, this is what I particularly call your attention to,

Mr. Schwarz. T am now reading from pages 225 and 226 of
the 694 , ages, which I will mark as Exhibit No. 6,
: ” (The above-mentioned document was
marked as Colby Exhibit 3

for identification.) au

Mr, Schwarz. Is it the fact that, for example, between

October 7 and October 38, 1968, the CIA conéucted a course for
the Washington Police Department in the subject of Surreptitious:
entry?

Mr. Colby. Tt was included in that, yes.

Mr. Schwarz, What was the purpose of conducting such a
course?

Mx. Colby. We had a relationship with various police
departments around the country, They from time to time would
like to learn our knowledge of certain subjects that are quite

unique to’ the CIA. There are a nusber of things tha

cr

to do in CIA which are quite frankly outside the norn of mest
other agencies of the Government.

Chairman Church. Doesn't surreptitious entry refer te:

illegal entry?
Mr. Colby. Going in secretly, that is what it means ,

Entering secretly in some fashion or other, yes,

Chairman Church. That is an illegal activity for local

Chairman Church, Why is CIA conducting courses teaching
local police illegal activity, he. to conduct illegal ops.ations

Mr. Colby, I think at that time, Nr. Chairman, that was

at the request of the police department of that area, that they

ne, a .

were interested in this thing, and there is a defensive element
of it. In order to know how to Protect against Something, it
is well to know how it is actually conducted.

Chairman Church. Do you construe this activity to be

within the law, the basic statute which restricts your domestic

attivities?
i Mr. Colby, I don't think it is a violation of the law,
Ise. Chairman.

I did give some directive on that in 1973, that we not

engage in this anymore, in compliance with the spirit of the

amendment to the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration

lact, sihich says that CIA will not provide Support to the LEAA
Yan its assistance to local police departments. And as far as
I was concerned, that is a policy that they don't want CIA in
touch with local police departments,

The fact of sharing our -knowledge of techniques with a

local police department does not in my mind get us into actually

conducting domestic police activity. There is a difference

there. . . a

Chairman Church. Yes. Sut apart from the technical
question of your jurisdiction, when you engage in teaching local
police departments how to conduct break-ins, surreptitious
break-ins, you are teaching them how to break the law.

Mr. Colby. You are teaching them how the law is broken.

.Chairman Church. That is right. - .

Mr, Colby. Which .can be useful to them in their knowledge
of how the law is broken, the techniques that are feasible.

Chairman Church. Or can be useful to them in knowing how
to break the law?

Nr. Colby. It could. It is an item of information that

they can use in ahy way they wish, either properly or improperly:

Mr. Schwarz. Are you aware of any situations where govern-!
mental officials, either state, local or Federal, have in fact
engaged in break-ins within the united States?

Mr. Colby. I know of certain situations related to foreign:
intelligence operations where access ip appropriate targets has |
been obtained either through subterfuge of pretending to be a 1

workman or Something of that nature, and I think in that history!

there are some cases of actual break-ins.

Now, I assure you, Mr. Chairman, we have been conducting

veak-ins abroad, ‘here is no question about that. Thet is,

we train our people to be able to do that.

Chaiman Church. That is net the question I am raising

: with you.

. In’ other words, these courses, it is my impression, were
generalized discuss sions of techniques. They were not Particular
handholding on conducting a@ specific operation,

I think am accurate in that statement.

Mr. Smothers, Mr. Colby, just a couple of quick guestions,

might have of former directors, are those still on Agenep——

Mr. Colby. Certain ones we do. I don't know of any thet

we don't have,

As far as I am concerned, they are Agency proverty, and
Eleave I am going to walk out without any paper.

Mr. Smothers. with respect then to the inguiries you ha-ve

Te ny

made with regard to information in the files on assassinations,
have these inquiries extended to an examination of these files
of former: Directors?

Mr. Breckinridge, Ia one or two instances on specific |

Points we have made inquiries, We have not gone’ through the

There is an executive registry where my correspondence is

files in general for that purpose, |

Nr. Colby. We have gone through that collection I know of

~ Mr. Smothers. What I am Searching for is the situation

where the generic classification of materials might somchow

and ‘x was wondering prior to our next meeting if a search |

Mr. Colby. I think it is easy for Mr. Helms. I think

, Senator Mondale. There is a reference. to John MeCone's
files in one of the memos that 1 looked at this morning. H
Mr. Colby. I will check that, Senator.
Chairman church, That is a good point, and I am glad you
have -raised it.
I think we will conclude the hearing at this point with

the understanding, Mr. Colby, we will be back in touch with you.

Mr. Colby. Surely. Many times, I think, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to add tvo things that have come to Ry attentio
on the subject of assassinations, both of which are allegations,!
