ACCOMPANIED BY SCOTT S. BRECKINRIDGE, JR., DEPUTY

INSECTOR GENERAL, ENNO KNOCHE, ASSISTANT TO THE

DIRECTOR, BHID GEORGE L. CARY, LEGISINTIVE COUNSEL

MI. Colby. I have an answer to a few of the questions

that were raised at the meeting the other day

and there ars a

couple of clarifications I would like to make.

One, with' respect to the security investigations in the

United States. The question was asked whether we ever used

private investigators, and I said we normally used our own

investigators. We have some relationships with private

investigatory firms which provide cover fox our investigators

and, secondly, We have a few firns which we own which are

proprietary if you will, whereby our investigators appear to

be private.

I said that in the past it is clear that on occasion we

did ask for private investigator firms to help us to some

degree.

It was usually the one that was giving us cover, and

for

reasons of overload we asked them to have their own people

to do a few of the investigations.

My General Counsel

says that this is illegal. I have a

strong question about its propriety, if not logality, and I

am undertaking to rcview this matter to see whether we can not

just eliminata that practice entirely, continuing the proprie-

tary and continuing the ass of private investigators as covrs

But I did vant to clarify that. I think I mentioned it

last time that there have been occasions on which this was

done.

Chairman Church, Mr. Colby, would you in connection with

your review of this matter supply the Conmittee with the spe-

cifics in those cases where the Agency has in fact engaged

private investigators to do Agency work?

Mr. Colby. I will certainly try to, Mr. Chairman.

confess this may be a tough job to locate every case but I

certainly will do my best.

• Chairnan Church. Will you provide the Committee with the

opinion of your Counsel with respect to the legality of such?

Mr. Colby. I will.

such use of private investigators?

Mr. COlby. Yes.

Chairman Church. And then I would ask the staff also

furnish the Committee with a

brief on that question so that we

are-fully advised with respect to the law.

Mc. Colby. Right.

The second subject, Mr. Chairman. Senator Mondale aske

for our command and control regulations for the approval of

covert action projects. These vere supplied to the staff on

the first of May and are available to the staff.

Thirdly, I was asked if Mr. Willian Harvey was removed

The facts are-that in June 1963 he was assigned

A54041

and in February of '67 he was.

reassigned to CIA Headquarters. He retired

voluntarily under

our retirement system on 31 of December 1967.

If I may, there is a reasor why he was taken out and if I

could go off the record and mention that to the Committee. It

is a matter of his privacy.

Chairman Church. Very well, off the record.

(Off

the record discussion)

Mr. Colby.: Back on the record.

Senator Schweiker. asked me whether Howard Hunt or James

Mccord were in charge of Mexican operations at the time of

President Kennedy's assassination on 22nd of November •63.

Boward Hunt fron. July '62 to August '64 was assigned as a

Section Chief in the Division of Plans Directorate, which is

now the Operations Directorate at CIA Headquarters, which had

no

responsibility whatsoever for Mexican operations.

Senator Schweiker. What were those dates again?

MI. Colby. July '62 to August '61.

Senator Schweiker. Wasn't he at some point in Mexico

City and in charge of that office?

Mr. Knoche. May back in the '50's he served ir. Maxico

City. Way back. He was not in charge.

Schator Schwailer. So that is the period you are sayins

he had no jurisdiction in any way with Latin Arcrica or Mexican

Affairs.

Mr. Colby. No, he was in what we call, and we have since

changed the name, to Domestic Operations Division at that time,

our operations here in this country, and that is a whole

different subject I would have to explain some day.

Mr. McCord from June '62 to June '64 was assigned as

CIA Security Officer in

and he had no responsibilities for Mexican operations at that

point.

Senator Morgan last time asked what information was given

to the Warren Commission concerning Agency assassination plans

concerning Castro, and I have been advised our records do not

indicate that the Warren Connission was provided with informa-

tion on this subject.

Allen Dulles, of course, I would note, who was the CIA

Diractor until the fall of

'61, was a member of the Warren

Cormission, but beyond thet fact I have nothing I could offer.

And then who made the decision not to provide it, if none

was given? Our records do not indicate that there was a CIA

decision on this matter not to tall the Warren Commission.

I could add that I beliave the relationship with the

Warren Commission was handled by one of our staffe robich

I cannot say that for sure, but I know the compartmentation

system was such.

Chairman Church. What was the name of the CIA agent who

was given the responsibility for liaison between the CIA and

the Warren Commission?

Mr. Colby. To my knowledge it is Mr. Raymond Rocca.

Chairman Church. Where is it now?

Mr. Colby. He retired at the end of December of last year.

He remained working for us for a few months. I think he is

retired. I think he is retired. I believe he is still in

the washington area.

Ix. Knoche. Yes, he is still working with us.

Mr. Colby. Still working with us to help on the transi -

tion of the whole counter intelligence program.

Chairman Church. Why did he retire?

Mr. Colby.. That was the Angleton case, Me. Chairman, and

the facts of that case were that I had had sone professional

differences in the organization with Mr. Angloton as to the

way the counterintelligence business was run and the way the

Israeli account was handled. I belisved that it required a

higher degree of coordination of the other elements of the

Directorate. and of the agency. We had debated this on various

occasions in thr past. I did reorganize that staff in 1973

and

endeavored to open up the Israeli account to a better clation-

ship with our otior fear Eastair activitics. He dabated this

over many months and on several occasions. He could never

really agroo to it bacause he insisted on the importance of

retaining it there it was.

Mx. Angleton had done a very good job of establishing that

liaison years ago and knew a lot of the senior Israeili who

were involved in it.

I believed there was inadequate coordination in the Arab

areas.

Also, I believed that there was a undue degree of compart-

mentation of that staff, that it needed more interchange with

our other divisions.

We debated this and discussed it and i

set as my time limit fox this discussion the end of December

because there were some very substantial retirement benefits

that people would loose if they stayed after that point.

Then

unfortunately the Seynour Hirsh article of December 22nd came

to our attention before it was actually published, and so I

brought Mr.

Anglston up and said that I was going to make tro

basic decisions. I was going to move the Israeli account fron

his control and I was going to put some sucessor leadership

into the Head of the Countorintelligence Staff. I said I would

offer him a post of tying together some counterintelligence

doctrina, he could stay wosting with us.

chose-to rctire. I insisted that I

talk to him before the

seymour llirs- article appeared.. I knew it was coming. I

didn't know what it was going to say. I vanted to make clear

between him and me that the decision was based upon our long-

standing discussion of how to run that particular activity.

The question then cane up wno would be his successor and

Mr. Rocca was his Deputy. There ware two other officers who

were possibilities. One of the officers, Mr. Hood, had said

in early December that he planned to retire at the end of

December.

The other two, Mir. Rocca and Mr. Miler, were informed

that they would

not be the successor Chief of that stafe.

Ti: s

ware offered a chance to stay on in their then current jobs.

They choss to retire. All foux of them agreed to stay with

us on a consultant basis over

the next several months to hslp

us on the transition of new leadership into that job, and they

have done so.

Chairman Church. Well, without getting off the track, I.

just have one further question here in connection with MI.

Anglaton himself.

Is it true that he is still being paid as a consultant?

Nr. Colby. I believe it has dropped off, Mr.. Chainian.

He did help us for three or four months but I believe that it

is terminated. It is about time to terminate it, I know, ard

wither it is on this particular date has been tipinated.

Mr. Colby. Absolutely not. It was to help us get over

Chairman Church. Very well.

Senator Mondale: I asked for vouchers on payments with

respect to assassinations?

Mr. Colby. I am looking for that. I don't have an answer

for you yet, Senator.

The request was also made whether we had any information

concerning plots to assassinate Chou En Lai. He have

erports

of two such examples, incidents, both conducted by the Chiness

Nationalists without our prior knowledge and without our

participation.

One in Aptril 1955, an Air India aircraft crashed at

sea off Indochina after departing from Hong Kong. Several

Chinese communist delegates for the Bandung Conference were

on board and it had been rumored that Chou En Lai would be on

the aircraft.

on the 11th of January 1956, the British Colonial Office

in London issued an official statonont reporting they had

evidence that the Chinese Nationalists haa bribed a long kong

airport: employce to place a time hemb on the airplane.

had flcd to Taivan. We had nothing to do with that incident

and frankly heard about it after it occurred.

In the fall of 1956, a senior Chinese Nationalist Officiall

informed an officer of CIA that a Chinese National plannad to

assassinate Chou En Lai during his visit to Cambodia in •

Novenber '56 and had been thwarted by the Cambodian arrest of

the Chinese Nationalist officer sent to. Phnom Penh to supervise

the attempt. He learned of this after it had happened and ve

had nothing to do with

it.

He had a relationship with the Chinese Nationalists

intelligence service over the years and, they clearly have done

things without our knowledge or involvament, and in a number

of areas, but we have also worked together on some areas.

These

are two that were separate.

Also I was asked to look at the photographs of Howard Hurt

and Sturgis that appeared in rawsweel some years ago. We

obtäined this photograph from the FBI last night about 5 o'clock

We had not had it before.

We had a copy of the Newsweek

edition..

These are photographs of Howard lunt in 1949, 1950 and

1961. This is the only photograph we have of Mr. Stusgis.

look at these two individuals here who vere picked up. He

examined them in considerable detail, and talking about the

'61 Hunt photograph, comparing it with this, and this is the

photograph, Newsweet photograph. You will see that there is a

lot of sort of fundamental differences in the kinds of .

appearances they have, diffcient characteristics of the

individuals.

With respect to sturgis, of course, we are not as confi-

dent because we don't have as good a base to work from in our

comparison but at the same time we see differences there also.

were able

to do a pretty good job on liunt and, what they do is

identify certain key points, make measurements and put adjust-

ments, the same thing we do for the satellite photography in

terns of these measurements, and things like that, and compara

it in that sense, and their conclusion: is that clearly this is

not Hunt. They are absolutely confident that this photograph

is not Hunt. They are less confident that it is not Sturgis

because of the base on which they are operating, but they think

it is not.

I point out that this analysis vas done overnight, about

3 o'clock in the morning.. This is sturgis.

they carried them in. I really don't know. If they took them

Mr. Colby. They can change then, honest.

Let me get my brief on that and I will answer that

question.

They magnified them to the same scale using the eyes and

mouth.

The contrast and texture differences were minimized,

continuous tone photographs employed and angular compensations

were made to offset errors incident to the different heads.

They can mix them around in that kind of fashion.

Mr. Colby. At the time we have had to work on this we have

just looked at the photographs.

Senator Schweiker. I assume that is where they are going

to be detained.

Mr. Schwarz. Hasn't the same analysis done for the

Rockefeller Commission about two months ago? In other words,

there has been an analysis at least once before last night,

hasn't there?

Mr. Knoche. Not by us.

Mi. ColbY. Perhaps by someone else.

Chairman Church. Nt. Director, that is a different

photograph.

Mr. Colby. It does 100k lilie it.

I will answer that question next time I come up.

Chairman Church. All right. How can we follow up on tha

identity of these two paople

Police?"

Hould that be done through the FBI?

Mr. Colby. FBI. I could ask or you could ask, it might

be better if you ask.

should be mariad as Conmittee Exhibits and staff should be

instructed to follow througl: with the FBI io get what further

supposed Oswald photograph leaving the Embassy?

Mr. colby, I don't have that with me. It is in the

the

Harren Conmission published report. It is in there.

Senator Schweiker. It is in there?

Mr. Colby. Yes. It was cropped slightly in ordar to

conceal where it was taker but it was --

Senator Schweiker. It is in the Harren Commission?

Mr. Colby. Yes, it is in the Warren Commission.

Just one additional matter.

• Chairman Church. Just one thing I would like to say to

you, ir. Colby, before I forget it. You have made reference

to the Israeli account and the special way that it had beer

handled under ir. Angletor. Before we finish our review with

you of covert operations we vould like to have a more detailsa

statement of that matter.

Mr. Colby. Right.

- Chairman Church. And I think you should prepara to

discuss it with us and we will have further questions to

ask

you in connection with it.

I just wanted to give you notice.

Mr. Colby. Right. In our lexicon it doesn't count as a

covert action but that is all right, no problen, I will cover

it.

Madama church. del right. At sons point ther in our

investigation?

Mr. Colby. Sure, no problom.

The only other ons thirg I would like to suggest for the

record, Mr. Chairman, with respact to the discussion of the

attempts made against ir. Castro, in no way justifying them.

My position on this is quite clcar. I do think it important

to put that exercise in the context of the times, which was

the times of the Bay of Pigs, which was a decision made by

the Government. The Cuban missile crisis, and following that,

a program approved by our normal covert action approval mecha-

nism to try to genorate an overthrow of Mr. Castro from within

Cuba by assisting various groups to go in with sabatage and

by putting economic pressure on the country, and so forth.

That went on for a number of years after the 1961-62 episodes

and I think it does put a cover of policy attitude toward Cuba

and toward MI. Castro that is an important factor in evaluat-

ing the thing, without in any way justifying the particular

attempts to assassinate him.

Senator Hart of Michigan.

But was there any evaluation

done at or about the time of that Cuban missile crisis?

Mx. Colby. There was an evaluation done after the Bay

of pigs, a rather intensive Investigation Internal Security

Branch Review of the activity and ther the Cuban missile

crisis came along shortly thereafter before anything vory much

got going. thereafter, however, a numbor oi progrune wat

conducted, which I am sure the Committse might want a general

sunmary of. I am just giving you one sort of a paragraph

summary of it, which were aimed at putting economic pressure

on cuba in the hopes that this would put pressure against him

and lead to its disorder and problems there and, secondly, to

encourage revolutions, sabotage and so forth, from within

Cuba through a variety of programs of propaganda, support of

exile movements, landing of teams on the coast, things of this

nature.

Chairman Church. The difficult with this is, as I see it

although, what you say is true, once an agency begins to cause

in assassination attempts the

disease spreads. Your own

testimony shows it spread

at least as far as the Dominican

Republic and ve are going to get into closer questions on

other matters such as Imumba and Chile.

so that I don't think this issue can be confined really :

to the emergency that did in fact exist between the US and

Cuba and the seriousness of that emergency at the time.

Mr. Colby. I agree with you, il. Chairman. I am against

it and have been against it for a long time, but nonetheless

I think in fairness to the people involved at that period

think it is important to give total context.

Chairman Church.

YES.

detcrmine, assuming intornally theain might have costemplate

additional efforts to assassinate Castro after the Bay of Pigs,

after the missile crisis, it would not have acted unless direct.

by the very

highest authority, would it?

Mr. Colby. That is not that clear, Senato= Hart. I think

the evidence we have is that the then Director was not

arare

of some of these activities and, therefore, one would have a

very difficult

time saying that it was pursuant to a specific

authorization. It was consistent with an overall policy which

was the point I was saying, but nonetheless I think the spa-

cific action we cannot say was approved even within the Agency

at ths Director

level.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Is there any indication that

the Director, who did know of at least an earlier attempt -

is there any indication that following the Bay of Pigs, or

following the missile crisis, he explicityly brought the sub-

ject up for review?

• ~ Mr. Colby. There is one documentary evidence that Mr.

¡ccone dictated in 1967, I believe it was, in which he recouncod

being informed of a meating, of ar inter-Agency meeting at

which the subject of assassination was raised, and he made a

particular point of indicating after the meeting - he was

not at the meeting; I beliove, but he heard of the meeting and

he made a particular poirt of saying: he disapproved of this

Mr. Osborn, which objectod to a memorandum by General Landsdald

which reforted to assassinations of political leaders, in a

memorandum regarding Operation Morgoose, which was Cuba. and

it referred

I gather you have a copy of that, but you don't feel

authorized to let us see it?

Hir. Colby. I do have

a

copy of it. The understanding

we have had with the other

agencies is that each of us gives

our ovn material but we refer to the other agency for any

documents belonging to the other agency.

Chairman Church. Well, it is very difficult for the

Conmittee to operate that way. I think that since the Comnittes

is entitled to this information, that when it is pertinent

and as we proceed in our haarings from one subject to another,

we ought'to be able to secure the information without having

to go back through executive channels.

Mr. Colby. May I undertake to get the permission to give

it to you? I will undertake to do this today.

Chairman Church. Any obsarvations that the Committee

wishes is make on this kind of a problem?

It is the first time is jas come up.

Senator llart of Colorado. Is this the undcrstanding ve

have had or rot?

Nr. Schwarz. It has been a total frustration to the staff

and I am very happy it has come up here because wa get chasia

around the corner by one agency to another. It is called the

"third agency ruls." It was intended to have nothing to do

with Congressional hearings. Obviously, it had to do with

declassification to the public, and it has happened to completel

delay our ability to gat infornation bacause we go at one agency

and then they determine that it really isn't their documant

or it mentioned some other agency, and then we have to go to

the other agency..

This is an example of how frustrating it is.

Senator Mondale. Have we tried to get this document from

the NSA?

Mr. Colby. No; this particular document had just come up

on Wednesday -

Senator Schweiker.

Does the coursel have any suggestions

as to what he feels the Committee position should be in this

area to enable him and staff to do an effective job?

Mr. Schwarz. I think the Committee's position ought to be

that portinent information should be produced by any agency

that possesses it, and if they wish to inform another agency

that they are doing it, they that is their business. But

think thuy should have to zirduce it if they possess

it.

Ar. Colby. The series of two or three meetings at that

time, yes.

Senator Mondale. I think this is very important because

apparently this was a meeting at which Mokamara and Rusk were

present, and apparently Mccone was present, so we had all of

the top principals.

Mr. Colby. At least ore of them.

to putting it in writing.

Chairman Church. All

we know is the subject of assassina-

tions apparently came up in the course of the mecting.

Mr. Colby. Mr. Chairman, as one of the agercies involved,

if I could offer one explaration for the third Agency Rule

even in this circumstance. And I am particularly interested in

this because sometines our documents have material whose

sensitivity is not apparent on the face and we assume that this

will be handled in certain compartmented channels, and if it

gets out of the compartment it might give problems that the

individual at the other end wasn't avare of. That is the

basis for the rule. The thought being go back and ask the

originator, and he has a feeling for that and could make the

particular case if something particularly sensitive is involved

Chairman Church. I would suggest, Hi. Colby, without

binding the Committae to a precedent, with respect to dealing

with tha Third Party Rule, that in this case you undertake

to

secure from the NSA -

Mr.

Colby. I will.

Chairmar. Church. - its permission to turn this particular

document over to tha Committes so it may be made a part of these

hearings.

Mr. Colby. I will endeavor to do that today, Mr. Chairman

Senator Morgan. Do wa have that?

Mr. Schwarz.

It was shown to us on Wednesday, marked

of deemed marked as part of the racord, and raturned to the CIA

who roturned it to us today.

Mr. Colby. I have anothar copy of it.

Senator Mondale. It refars to a meeting in Ar. Rusk's

office at which presumably. McNamara and Rusk, I gathur from tha

later memo, and liccona ware prasent, and it says this.

"I called Lansdale's office and ir his absence pointea ou

to Frank Head

the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this

typs of comment in writing in a document. The words he objected

to ware including liquidation of leaders. I advisad him as

far as CIA was concerned we would write no document pertaining

to this and would participate in no open meating to discuss

it."

I read that to mean we will go ahead and do it but we don's

want anything in vriting and don't want to be in a meeting where

it is going so lunk. That mares a lot of sense. No liviro

politician vants to boarsocicted with an assassination, ever.

if he wants someone

assassinated. I thirk that is common sense:

That is why I think these documents are so crucial.

Chairman church; Of course they are crucial and we must

have them.

The ambiguity, however, that we have yet to clear up is

in the third paragraph, Senator Hondale, where the menorandum

reads the question of assassination, particularly of fide?:

Castro, was brought up by Sacrctary McNamara at a meeting of

the special group augmanted in Secretary Rusk's office in

August. It was the obvious consersus at that meeting, in

answer to a comment by fir. Ed Nurrow, that this is not a subject

which has been made a mattar-of official record, the subject

being the question of assassiration.

Now, that leaves us still without any documentary proos

that it was revealed at this meating that the CIA was in fact

engaged in an effort to assassinate.

Senator Mondale. Was Lansdale working for the CIA at

this time?

Mr. Colby. Pardon?

Senator Mondale. Was General Lansdale working for the

CIA at this time?

Mr. Colby, General Lansdale was Assistant to the Secictary

of Defense, not CIA, at that time.

Senator Mondule. Had Lansdale been with the CIA?

Ir. Colby. He was with cin in about 1952 to about

1955.

And that it was agreed that no study or review of this

So we are left without an answer to this question.

there is a standard operating procedure of your Agency an

effort not to make notes, an effort for cartain individuals

not to have certain knowledge by design.

For instaice, I was reading your menorardun here dated

I June 1973 in which you are reporting on a meeting that occurred

You make a point to say that you brialed somaona orally. Tha

word "orally" is in there - assuming that for the purpose

somtone should know that you did not put anything ir writing

or you did not give him a writter report.

You also say that I personally managed to avoid gaining

any troilsage of what precise actions were taken.

I think a reasonable infarencs there is that there is a

deliberate on your part here

-- and maybe this is standard

operating procedure - for you not to get specific information

so that you always will be in the position of not knowing some-

thing.

• Mr. Colby. I don't recogniza the raference. Cartainly,

I think in past years there ware situations ve did not want

to commit to writing.

There is a great deal of effort made by us to what wa

call compartment information so that it is known only to cettain

paople and not known to others. The compartment is still to

be open at the top, however.

There are things that I purposaly try not to krow. I don't

The

reason it was addressed to william E. Colby is we

were going through that period in the middle of 1973 where I

was tachnicallyi I guass, Director of Operations but had beers

nominated to bacon: Diractor. This was the kind of thing that

normally would be addressed to the Director but we had an

Acting Director, General Walters, but it was pretty clear I

was responsible for making the machinery run and we had a lot

of things around the Agency addressed to me and signed by me.

I believe this follows a conversation I had with a M..

Walter Elder, who was an Assistant to Mr. John McCone -- he

was Executive Assistant when he was Director - I think Mr.

Elder told ma

that there were certain things that he krew of

in the background that related to this effort of identifying

various quastionable activities of the Agoncy, and I asked

him to go write them down so we could get them into the

Inspactor General's report.

Senator liuddleston. The only question I raisa, I don't

want to gat off into the contents of a particular menorandum,

but the contaxt with the area you ware pursuing, just whether

or not standard operating procedure would require at timas

there be a deliberate avoidance by certain people in the

Agency of facts and whather of not there is a great body of

decisions that are made and implemented without anything vritter

down, so that trere rouli never be any documentary evidence

of it?

Mr. Colby. Well, I thin that you certainly can say that

there is an avoidance by à lot of prople of learning things

that they are not authorized to know. I mean the more loyal

in a sensa of our employees, say that they have authority to

know what it going on in, say, Cuba, they don't have a right

to know what is going on in, say, China, and they rather

carefully keep themselves fron learning what is going on in

China. I think that is a pravalence.

I think the question you are asking, however, is whether

wa are trying to keep activities off of paper and it is pretty

clear that the assassination story vas essentially kapt off

the paper:

And I would think that is about the only one. No, the

drug thing. I assuna some of that was kapt off of paper?

Mr. Breckinridga. Yes.

Mr. Colby, The lasson that I have frequently given to

my colleagues in the bureaucracy is that however hard you try

to keep it off of papar, you will not succesd in a burzaucracy,

somebody will write it down and, therefore, it is a totally

feckless exercise to pretend that you can keep it sacret by

not writing it down. But the fact is there were situations

in which a conscious effort was made in the past to keep things

off the rucord.

Senator Huddlestos.. To sum up, you, as Director, with the

Mx. Colby. Mo. As a matter of fact, I take the opposit.

reiterated a number of times, I cannot ba subjected to surprise.

You have got to let me know the things

to us information about various things, evan though they may

not be written down?

Mr. Colby. You hava my commitment to that effect.

Senator Huddleston. Going further and looking through

the files for notes and documents?

Mr. Colby. It is my hope, Serator, that I can help you

on this investigation rather than defending myself against you.

Senator Huddleston. That is all.

Mr. Colby. That is what I would like to have the relation-

Now, Senator Mondale.

Senator Mondale.

The menorardum from John McCone that

we received this morning, dated 14 April, 1357, is addresser

to the Director.

time?

MI. Colby. No, he left in 1965.

Senator Mondale. So this was a memorandum from a person

no longer with the CIA, as former Director to the current

Director, which begins

"no memorandum can be located covering

the August, '62 meeting."

That is the one that earlier says the question of

assassination was discussed.

However, it is highly probable

that one exists.

Now, I would like all documentation, records, and notes

that bear on the question of what McCone was raferring to,

bacause I get the impression that the then Director, Mr. lielms

Mr. Colby. Yes.

Senator Mondale. - was reviewing the question of documental

tions and records affacting that meeting, or the question of

assassiration, and I think ve nead to know what transpirea,

what was happening then, what kind of responses ha received.

Me. Colby. Ma will curtainly give you that.

I can givo

This axercise stenned from the revelasion in Jack

Anderson's columns, I belisve, of our relationship with the

Mafia figures at that time. This then generated the relest:

to 11x. Breckinridge to do an Inspector General's report of

this whole subjact, which he did, and which we will cortainly

make

available to this Comnittee.

In the course of it, and with the publicity, tir. Mccora,

who does

maintain an occasional contact with the Agency, he

is a friend of it and an ex-Director -- I see him every now

and again and try to sort of keep him up with what is going

on in general terms without getting into political or sensitiva

matters or anything -- but he doas maintain this contact and

I am sure that somebody made contact with him or he made contaci

with the Agency about the Jack Anderson column, and that then

generated this particular memorandum.

Sanator Mondala. And there was an Inspector General's

study done at that time?

MI. COlbY- Yes, sir; and you will get access to that.

-.. --

Senator Mondale. Can we have documentation as to how

it was originated and the response to what was done?

Chairnan Church. Yes, we should have that information.

and I might say that you are aware, no doubt, that charges have

been made that documents have been destroyed in the Cia which

may have been connected with the general subjact of CIA

involvamant in assassination efforts.

We know is there.

On the Castro assassination, the involvement with the

Mafia, there ware a faw memoranda in the Office of Sacurity,

and I think you have copias of those.

there was no attention on the part of the people who vere

the sense that the original work with the Mafia was engaged in

and there is a full record. and that exists today.

I will go back to the Cubella case.

In the instance of the Dominican Republic, the record

was very full then and it is still very full today. I am

certain that record is complete.

Again, in the minds of the people who were involved, they

drew a line between the support they gave to the coup group

and conscious association with assassination as such. Those

records are complate and those racords were developed at the

time and thay ware retained.. It was in the period of the

Mafia was involved where paople knew the purpose was assassina-

tior..

.

The records are practically non-existent and I balieve

they never existed.

Harvey, who conducted the second phase of that, at the

time of our investigation had a handful of cryptic notes that

only he could interpret. We couldn't interpret them. And

it is my understanding. that those notes no longer exist. Thei

were retained by him and he brought them in at the tima that

we were questioning him. He was then on sick leave prior to

retiranant.

Those notes vere totally unrevealing.

I think that those records are in the same state today

pris

that they ware then.

There were none in the Castro affair except the resalts

of our inventigution involving the Mafia.

point that on the very day of Presidant Kennedy's assassination

a man was masting with Cubella in Paris, and in response to

Cubella's request offered him an assassination davica that at

the tine of the investigation we understood he accepted but

I have sinca been told he did not accept. It was a ballpoint

pen converted into a syringe for injecting poison.

subseguently, arms were handed to Cubella by a Cuban

refugee in Madrid, in the very early part of 1965, and two

catches were put down by boats off Cuba for Cubella. I think

he may have recovered ona of those but not the other. The

racords on that are pretty complete.

so, generally speaking, on those things where the Agency

was involved, with the exception of the association with the

Mafia, where from the beginning the intent was assassination,

the records are complete, and I think that if people look at

those they will find this is so.

M5. Schwarz. Is the understanding that all records dealing

with this subject, whether they ara in Inspector General,

reports or underlying documents, would be produced for our

inspection?

Mr. Colby. Yes.

possibly some individual rames in it that wa would hope that

HiI, Colby. •I have a copy.

Mr. Colby. No.

Mr. Schwarz. Was he then in his position with ITT, or

did he have sone other position?

Now, did Mir. McCone have documents outside the Agercy,

outside of the Agency.

HI. roche. Hir. McCone wrote ns that manorandun while or

had tha benafit of his ex-staff assistant, ir. Walter Elder,

helping him in doing a little research in this conrection.

by then.

I think we have located some sinca that time.

that was

a national policy, not just a CIA -- keeping an

-coronic pressure on Cuba and continuing to support the

various elments which might eventually lead to a change ir

the Cuban govarument through soma ovarthrow or otherwise.

I think some propoganda programs were kept up, some exile

activities were kapt up, some training of teans to be infil-

trated into Cuba vare kept up, some sabotage oparations were

continued. ind thosa continued over the following saveral

months. .

Right after the 1962 missila crisis.- I cannot identify

right offhand hera any particular review of that - but I

know that that was a subject of 40 Committes considaration at

various times.

Whether that included assassination or not I cannot say.

My guess, as I say, is that if John McCone didn't inow

about it, it was not covered in those discussions because it

would be very hard to cover them without his being involved.

and transcribed? Is there raw matarial relating to that

investigation to which this Cormittea could gair access?

Mr. Colby.

I don't know the ansvar to the question, Mr.

Chairman. Maybe Mr. Breckinridge can help us.

1r. Breckinridge. I am not familiar with that study.

I am familiar with the approach that was taken at the time

withir our organization when the Inspector General - I was

not involved in that study but I have heard it discussed

how they approached it.

Their undurstanding of the 3ay of Pigs problem ias the

overall invasion plan and organization for that and concantrated

on that.

By way of explanation for the omission of reference to

the assassinations, so faw people knew about it, and I think

it came to no ona's attention - simply did not discover it

at that time. And it may not have been by way of explanation,

not a justification. It may not have been associated in the

minds of the people who did know about is with the inquiry

into the military operation.

No. Breckiäridge. Right.

Mr. Schwarz. And NI. Dulles, at least the records we

put in on Mednesday, knew about in and he was substantially

involved in the Bay of Pigs. Chose gentlemen surely would have

been questioned by General Taylor and Attornay General Kennedy

Is that fair?

Mr. Breckinridge. I would assume so.

Mr. COlby. Certainly, yes. But again, if the focus was

on the military operation, it might have been that that other

operation was not involved in it.

Mx. Schwarz. The racord further shows that on May 7, 1962,

a mesting was held with Attorney Ganeral Robart Kennedy in

which the contemporancous document describing that meetirg

indicates that he was not told that there was a continuirg

and ongoing operation, bus rather was told of something unici

was not callad an assassination but was called a projec:

was told of something which was raferred to ir the past tense;

is that right?

Mr. Colby. It was in the past tense.

Whether there. res

any other discussion in that meeting on this subject we just

don't krow.

Colonel Edwards, who was Director of Sucurity, under whose

had withdrawn from it.

The operation, whan it was reactivaied later, was ruactivate

on a compartmented basis, and Colonul Edwards did not krou

about it.

Mr. Schwarz. Ever though it continued to involve the

Mafia until early. 1963?

Mr. Breckinridge. That is correct. Colonel Edwards 20

General ha did not know that this secord operation, this

raactivation of the operation that had formerly run under his

Colonel Edwards and Gansral Counsel Houston as being the

persors who would go to brief Attorney General Kannedy?

Mr. Breckinridge. I am not sure I know that.

authority within the CIA; is that correct?

Mr. Breckinridge.

Wa have tried to detarmine.

Mr. Houston, if I understand it, feels that he would not

I gather that it is not all that clear in Colonel Lares'

Mr. Schiarz. So someone selected these persons to go

Number tivo, they did not know the plot for assassination

Mr. Brackirridge.

Correct.

Mr. Schwarz.

Kennedy was giver the impression that

Mt. Schwarz.

Can we determine then who was responsible

for selecting those persons to brief Attorney General Karnedy,

instead of including in

the group other parsons who knew that

the Mafia part of the assassination attemos as ongoing?

Mr. Brschirridge.

I don't thirk that we can now.

-As I say, there is no written racora.

Me. Schwarz: Who could it have been? Who was in a

higher position of authority, in a position to make a decision

as to who should brief Attorney General Kennedy?

The FBI approached Colonal Edwards when their investigatic:

that time..

I cannot reconstruct beyond that so I really can't

Chairman Church. You see, the state of the recordlico

now

suggests a cover-up, arother covar-up. It suggests

that

those who were selected

by the higher authority in CIA to

brief the Attornay General had knowledge limited to an atteno:

on the life of Castro that had been concluded.

It further suggests that they had no knowledga of continuita

efforts then underway, even though presumably their superiors

did hava such knowledge. This leaves the Attorney Genaral ir

a position of being told about the past program and not baing

told about the present program, and we know that he later said

to certair. assistants of his that he had put a stop to

assassination attempts on Fidel Castro and he may have been

left with the impression, as a result of this meeting, that

there were no further astempts. He may have said he wanted no

further attempts.

We don't krow. But clearly he was not told

that there were further astempts then underway.

• Senator Morgan. Were we told yesterday or the day befora

yesterday, that he knew of the Cuban majors' operation?

Mr. Schwarz. We were not told that.

Mr. Breckinridge. I cannos clarify the question completely

but I can introduce a little bit more.

When the discussion occurred iir. Houston did go and,

talk fa

with General Carter, who was then the Deputy Director

Mr. Schwarz. Which discussion are we talkirg about now?.

Nr. Breckinriige. The discussion abour going to the ittor.

Glarcana

had a personal love affair with a well know entertainer

who was then in Las Vegas, and she was sispected by him of then

having an affair with another well known entertainer.

Giancana went. to Robst Haheu, through whom these introduc-

tions were first made -

Mr. Schwarz. Introduced to the Mafia persornel?

1x. Breckinridge. Yes.

Mr. Colby. Between CIA and the. Mafia.

Mr. Breckinridge. Ard asked Maheu toarrange to have the

room of the male entertainer in Las Vegas hugged. They hired

a private detective who ther did this. The roommate stumbled

on the equipment, the private detective was arrested, and the

FBI investigativa trail led from the private detective to Maheu

to Giancona and eventually to CIA. Giancana had insisted that

Maheu help him because he had helped Maheu with the introduction

to the head of the Cubar. syndicate, and Maheu had then agrced

to get a private detective to do it.

So this arose in the context of a domesticiolation of

wirstapping laws and the FBI vas investigating it on that basis.

Because the trail led to clancana androselli, wio vasten

involved in this, both

"# whom

were high on the FlI list, as they progressed towards developing

a prosecution, they came to Colonel Edwards, the FBI did, and

said what is your position on this. The position of the Agency

as stated by Colonel Edwards was we did not want them prosecuted

because it would expose what he understood to be this operation,

and I guess the time sequence gets a little fuzzy in my mind.

Mr. Schwarz.

Did he tell the Director of the FBI the

nature of

the operation, or simply he told him it would concern

some sensitive matter?

Mr. Breckinridge. He told him it was an intelligence

operation in country, and the Mafia was being used for that

purpose.

so in the discussions as it progressed, it dealt with

the wiretap prosecution. Colonel Edivards in discussing it

with us in 1967, according to our notes, said that they briefed

the Attorney General all the way, but at that time Colonel

Edwards, I think by the time they did it, Colonel Edwards thought;

it was over. So the Attorney General and the FBI were not told

the complete story.

Nt. Schwarz.

They weren't told the most important part

of the story, and that was that it was continuing.

Mr. Breckinridge. They didn't know that, that is correct.

Chairman Church. So you have here two violations of law.

Mr. Colby, CIA was not involved in the wiretap.

Chairman Church. As I understand it, the CIA was involved

because it engaged a private --

Mr. Breckinridge. I am sorry.

Chairman Church. Maybe I misunderstood.

Mr. Breckinridge. He didn't learn about this until after

the FBI found out about the Nafia involvement in that wiretap.

This was done by a private detective hired by a private businessma

at the request of Giancana.

MI. Schwarz. CIA agents had committed the crime, in this

case, but not on behalf of the CIA.

Mr.. Breckinridge. No, no.

Mr. Schwaiz.

Isn't that accurate?

Mr. Breckinridge. No.

Mr. Colby: I wouldn't call Giancana an agent, getting

back to our definitional problems.

Mr.

Schwarz. CIA associates.

Mr. Colby. CIA instrument. We had a contact with Giancana,

obviously, and with Maheu. They decided on their own to do

this wiretapping, or bugging, or whatever it was, without our

prior knowledge.

They got caught. Then they said if this is

fully investigated and brought out, it will bring out the CIn

Senator llart of Colorado. Was the CIA not concorned that.

Giancana inay hava told something about this Cuba: operation to

the fumala entertainer who also may have

told the male

entertainer?

Mr. Brechinridge. No. If I understand what happened,

and I an now describing what Mi. Maheu said, and I get this

fron having read some files at the Department of Justice -

recently - when Mr. Maheu tried to axplain to the FBI his

position and tried, to provide a rational for doing this, ha

said I thought there was a leak in Chicago and I warted to have

the room of this entertainer bugged so I could find out if

Giancana had leak÷d.

The FBI gave this the kind of cradit I think it was entitlad

to. They didn't pay much attention to it. This was something

he tried to develop to justify his involvement.

There is no indication that there were any leaks fron

Chicago that we know of, somathing that he would know of, ars

there was no instruction on our part for him to do such a thirg,

and it was for another reason Giancana asked him to do it.

Serator Hart of Colorado. As far as you can tell from tha

record, tha CIA was not concerned that Giancana and his fenale

friend, or her male friend, may have blown the Cubar operation?

Mr. Breckinridge. No.

Mr. Breckinridge:

did brief the Director. Who was then Mr. Nicone. Dur notes

written in 1957 say thare is no indication that General Carter

was bri-fed on the full details of the assassination plot.

So while he did approve their going and briefing the Attorrey

General about this association with the lafia, there is no

indication that he was

told the full story then either.

Then in August of 1963, the document that

Mr. Breckinridge.

That is correct.

The documentation you collscted and what you do have

positively, who was the highest ranking official, according

Chairman Church. According to the positive documents

that you have of knowledge.

kr. Breckinridge.

First, let he say we did not have

documentation. It was based mostly on intorviers, this

pariod involving the Mafia.

The highest person that wa understood that knew during

the first phase with Hir. Bissel. That we clearly did know

about it: There was discussion at one point in which ir.

Bissel, Colonel Edwards, the two of them, mat with fir. Dulles

and had a conversation in which I can best say there was

this mesting when it occurred ir 1960, left us with the inpressic:

while they had met with it. Dulles, that the corversation is

not in precisa terms. As Colonel savards said to us, wa

didn't use.any bad words, which meant they didn't use the

word "assassination," but they discussad an operation against

Castro in-such terms that he felt that they had conveyad the

message to MI. Dulles. But there is room for doubt.

Senator Schweicksr. Once "II. Dulles left the Agency, who

then

became the highest rankiry person to know, according

to your investigation?

he would be the highest persor at this point.

Senator Schweicker.

At this

point. But he left the

Agency in 1061. Five years of assassination attempts ventiono

after that.

Colonal Edwards baliaves that ir. Dulles understood the

conversation. He also said that he engaged in doubletali so

that thers was room for misunderstanding.

Me. Schwarz. I show you a documant stamped 0012, headed

John Rosalli and ask you what it is.

Mr. Breckinridge: This is a mano prepared in the Office

of Sscurity describing John Rosalli, who is the first of the

menbers of the syndicate who was used to arrange the introductic!

to the head of the syrdicate in Cuba.

Mr. Schwarz. And written when?

HI, Breckinridge. I am not sure. I suspect it was writte

in 1973 but I would have to check.

ir. Schwarz. Does it refer to a Castro assassiration

attenpt involvirg the lafia?

Hr. Breckinridge. Does

the word "assassination" appear?

I think it rafers to the Mafia.

Pir. Schwarz. Do you hars any doubt, in fact, this is

referring to the assassination affort involving laheu, rosalli,

Trafficanta, in connection with Castro?

Mr. Schwarz. Ard does this document prepared by the

The understanding of the Office of Security is that Mr.

Dulles doss know or did know. The question that vas raised

in the course of our irguiry was that the nature of the masting

described to us raised

a question of doubt. That we dia

not resolve.

Chairman Church. I think if we accept your testinory

that there was at least an element of doubt as to whether or

not ir. Dulles knew of the conraction baticen the CIA and the

Mafia, and its purpose, to assassinate lix. Castro, let's get

back to Senator Schweicker's questior. After Hir. Dulles left

several mors plots were formed involving the CIA and having s

to do with subsequant attempts on the life of Castro.

Now, what does your invastigation show and what can you

tell us with respect to the highest officials in the CIA,

following the departure of Mr. Dulles, who may have had knowludg

of these ongoing operations?.

Chairman Church. Wher. was the operation renewed?

Nr. Breckinridge. The operation was actually reactivated

in April of 1962. It was plarned to be reactivated prior to

that but the employee who had responsibility for it did not

get free until April of '62 whan he actually reactivated it.

There is no indication that anyons above the level of Mr.

Bissel in 1961, at the time that this was discussed, there

is no

indication that aiyone above his laval knew that it

was to be reactivated. This officer, Mr. Harvay, them tox

- Mr. Harvey was given the responsibility of this by Mr.

Bissel ard originally it continued as a separate action from

the Castro operation, but iI. Harvey vas also givan that

responsibility, and for all intents and purposes they became

wedded.

Mr. Helms was the parson who formally approved ZR Rifle

as a project. ZR. Rifle had a dual purpose that has not bean

clarified by our inguiry. It aoparently was in fact used for

the stated purposes,

as far as organizational activities ent

money had bean spent and this would be acceoted.

It had a project, amount of some dollars, $7502 - 510,000 --

some of it to include the salary of an agent, some to inclua:

operating expenses.

So it. Helms' main appearance in the approval of zR Rifle

does not necessarily equate with the date when he became

familiar with the Castro opsration.

Mr. Schwarz. Because of the dual purpose of Rifle, Rifle

means both, rifle files and used rifles?

- Mr. Breckinridge. I think that is probably correct.

It

was in the fall of 1961 that Mr. Harvey was given this assignment

by Mr. Bissel. I think it. Bisse: left in 1962. I am no: sure

of the dates,

So Mr. Bissel would have known at that time.

But I am not sure after that.

Chairman Church.

Helms succeeded it. Bissel as chief

of operations?

Mx. Colby. Deputy Director of Plans.

Chairman Church. Deputy Director for Plans.

Your record shows that Helms had knowledge of the 2R Rifle

operation, which, among other things, was to develop an executio

capability - whatever that means. Presumably that means a

capability to conduct an assassination if and when authorized

by proper authority?

NI. Breckinridge. That is my understanding.

Chairman Church. Is that-your understanding?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir.

• Chairman Church. 1

Do your records show that, or is that

based upon what has been revealed through your interrogation?

Mr. Breckinridge. First;

•let me go back and clarify, then

I will answer this question; if I may.

Mr. Helms approved ZP. Rifle, which the record showshas the

responsibility of

also the responsibility for executive action capability.

That

1s a difficult phrase.

The record does not show that Mr. Helms knew when he approved

the projest that it had this dual role. so from that poin: of

view, I have a record that shows what the project was supposed

to have been as far as its open description, though classified,

and the result of our interviews. with fir. Harvey which tell the

other story about executive action capability. So it does not,

the record does not show that Mr. Helms at that time knew what

that was.

Chairman Church. If Harvey knew that it had this other

aspect, who would have told him to develop such a capability, is

it were not his superior?

Mr. Breckinridge. I think that is a logical conclusion, bus

I was distinguishing what the record showed and what our interviers

developed.

Chairman Church. Didn't you ask. Harvey in interviewing

him shether or not llelms had told him to develop this capabllies.

as a part of the ZR Rifle?

Didn't, you ask him who told him to develop this capability,

or did he do it on his own?

Mi. Breckinridga. Your question is a very proper one, and

my difficulty is with the record which goes back to what Bissel

instructed Harvey to do.

Mr. Schwarz. Before licims took the job, Bissel told Harvey

record that came from our interviews on this score. All I

am trying to do is draw the distinction between what the recor

shows and what our interviews: developed, and there are

gaps

in that.

capability, which was a capability to assassinate if. and wher

attempt, which was connected with a continuing relationship

yes.

that I

would try and find the date, and I was out of town yesterday

and simply didn't do it. But I have to go through the rucord

to find the earliest date that we have, and I simply have to go

No; I am talking about when did ve

finally cease and desist in attempting to assassinate Castro,

from your records?

Mr. Breckinridge. Let me, if I may, and I don't mean to

confuse the issue -- the Mafia connection from beginning to end

was an attempt to assassinate Castro. The operation was called

off finally in the Spring, perhaps February, of 1963.

Senator Hart of Michigan. What year?

Mr. Breckinridga. 1963.

Mr. Schwarz. That is the Nafia part?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir. The Cuballa Association has

Mr: Breckinridge. Harvey. Harvey decided that it couldh't

succecd. Harvey was leaving the country for a foreign assignmen

and in conversation with Poscili- Roselli was the man who was

in the Mafia through whom the Agency had continued to work --

and Roselli agreed that nothing was happening, nothing could

happen, and it should be called off. We don't have a record

that harvey went anywhere for approval. This doesn't mean that

he may not have discussed it, but I don't have the record of it.

So Harvey in his conversation with Roselli, terninated the

operation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. The memo which we saw at the

last session, which I don't know ve officially have, 'ir. Colby

made it available to us - was a wrap-up of the whole thing, or

memo to the files, and I can't recall now who did it.

Mr. Schwarz. That is the one referring to the meeting

with Robert Kennedy that we spent some time lcoking at.

Senator Hart of Colorado. That was the Sheffield-edwards

meno which say with the collapse of the Bay of Pigs invasion

operation, no further attempt was made with the Mafia. It tied

it directly to the Bay of pigs.

Mr. Colby. That was the first phase. There was a second

phase that followed with the

Mafia.

the life of Castro?

Mr. Breckinridge.

This brings us to Senator Schweiker's

question. A man by the name of Orlando Cubella, who had been

met in Mexico City by the Agency in 1961, who had been one of

10

11

12

the leaders of the anti-Batista groups and held the rank of rajor

in the Cuban

army, that is the highest rank they have, Cubelia

was an M.D. and had been a youth leader and attended youth

13

conferences around the world, and was met first in Mexico Citz.

14

and later he was met in Scandinavia on several occasions.

And

15

the conversations during these various meetings had to 2o with

16

Cubella's desire to have a change in Cuba, and the attempt on

17

the Agency people who met with him to explore his ability to

18

19

substitute a. government as well as be able to overthrow the

existing government.

20

These conversations

were very general, exploratory,

and

21

non-productive.

22

In one of the early metings with Cubella, he taiked about

23

climinating Castro, and the Agancy employee used the word

24

assassination, which was

reported back as being an ofiensive

25

word to Cubella, and instructions were issued that Cubella las

He was met in October of 1963, at which time he made the

proposai that he wished to have rapons with which to cormit

an assassination, and this proposal was rejected.

He continued to speak in these terms, and finally, I cannot

give you the level of approval -- that might be at the level

of Mr. Fitzgerald - and I don't recall which job Mr. Fitzgerald

had then, whether he headed the Cuban Task Force or whether he

had become --

•

Mr. Knoche. He replaced Harvey.

Mr. Schwarz. He did meet with this man and gave him a

weapon or poison pen with which to kill Castro?

Mr. Breckinridge. Fitzgerald did not give him the pen.

Mr. Schwarz. But discussed the subject?

Mr. Breckinridge. I was considering the question of

level of authorization, and I don't recall. I would assume

Mr. Fitzgerald was the highest level of authorization that Ins

know of.

Chairman Church. And Fitzgerald's position at that

time?

Mr. Breckinridge. I was guestioning whether he had -- he

had three jobs in fairly quick succession. tether he replaced

Harvey as head of the Cuban Task. Foice, then he becane Chief of

Milki, the western Hemisphere Division, and then he became for

a short time Deputy Diicetor of Plans. But he died of a heart

I think at that time he was either head of tic

Cuban furse or Chief of the Hesten Homisphere Division.

Chairman Church, Will you get that for the record?

MI. Colby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Breckinridge. The decision was taken to try and give

Cubella some instrument. A ball point pen was designed that

could be used as a syringe. Because Cubella was a doctor, the

pen was given to him in Paris on the 22nd of November, 1963,

with the suggestion that he use it.

• Chaizman Church. By whom was the pen given?

Mr. Breckinridge. It was given by a case officer of the

Agency. In fact, Cubella refused to take it. When we irote our

report, ve thought he accepted it, but I've since learned he

refused it. He said it was not practical.'

Because he was a doctor it was suggested that he could

acquite the material to put in the pon, but he refused to accept

it.

Conversations continued, and finally the Agency arranged

to put down two caches at sea off the coast of cuba, one of

which had weapons in it, one of which had just goneral eguiprent

Senator Schweiker. Could cither of those involve the story

that appeared in the press under Colonel Prouty's' statement?

Mr. Breckinridge.

No, sir.

Mi. Breckinridge. Ne arranged to have a Cuban refugee

leader meet Cubella in Spain, at which time he gave nim an

additional weapon. That would have been in February of 1964,

I think.

Chairman Church.

what kind of weapon was given to him?

Mr. Breckinridge. It is my recollection it was a rifle.

I

am not sure of that.

Cubella continued to have conversations and meetings iron

time to time as he came out of Cuba, and finally in the middle

of 1965 the decision was taken to cut off contact with him

because there were serious guestions about the scurity of his

organization.

MI: Brcckinridge. I don't know the level at which the

contacts were known. I would assume that the continuina contac

were known at a high level, but I have to assume that, and this

goes to a point when Senator Schweiker was asking the question

at the last time. This is the last instance that we know of

in which assassination was involved.

Senator Schweiker. That is, both your records and your

interviews indicate that this was the last known activity,

according to your investigation?

Mr. Breckinridge.

That was specifically related to

Castro:

Sanator Schweiker. And that date was when?

Mr. Breckinridge.

viell, our contact with the Cubella group

was

broken off in June of 1965.

Senator Schweiker.

June of when?

Breckinridge.

1965.

I don'e want to confuse you, but I would like to introduce

consideration that relates to this.

Chairman Church, Before you do that, I have asked what

your investigation shows is the highest officer who knew and

under

whose authority these continuing contacts were made,

and

you said you assured it nust have been known to higher authoriti.

2iI- Breckinridge. I said that about the contacts.

About

the contacts, I assuned this was known fairly high in the Agency

considered that the purpose of the association with Cubella was

he was a man

who was high in the Castro government, he was a

man who represented a dissatisfied element, he had people who

agreed with him, and the hope was that this could be developed

10

into a group in Cuba that in some way could replace the govern-

11

ment..

12

The conversations with Cubella were really not productive,

13

and Cubella wanted demonstration of support, tangible support,

14

and the conversations progressed to the point that he wanted

equipment with which he could commit and assassination.

16

In the minds of the people who dealt with him, the question

of assassination was not uppermost, so much as it was to give

hin a material denonstration of support.

I don't mean to be trite, but the United States or the

should have required higher lovel approval. I don't know what

the level of approval was.

Mr. Schwarz.

It should have under the normal procedures?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir.

Chairman Church. At one point a meeting took place and an

agent of the CIA gave him a ballpoint pen that had been special!

designed to camouflage a syxinge, and gave it to him with the

recommendation that it would be filled with poison and used to

kill Castro.

Are you saying that the agent may have done this without

the knowledge of the Director or the Deputy Director for Plans;

soreone high in the Agency?

Mir. Breckinridge. No; I am saying there should hava been

authorization. I don't know the level of that authorization.

I

merely tried to draw a distinction because it is a question saiso

in my mind, it was raised by Senator Schweiker's question - wher

was the last attempt of assassination?

This developed to the point where assassination was

involved, and this was the last such interest that we know of.

Senator Schweiker. Are you saying after the incident that

Senator Church just asked you about, at that point the emphasis

shifted from assassinating him to replacing him?

Is that what you are. trying to toll us, or did I misconstru.

for the racora I would lika to say this so I car. remember why

I was pursuing this later o..

I asked these quastions not to try to show the assassinasiu

plar, bacause I think that has already baan established, ard

if that is all we are after we can move on to something else.

But the thing that does concern me is thai if this prin

continued on until and past the time thai President Kenrady

was

assassinated, then it raises a question? in my mird as to

whether or not Castro hinsalf may not well have know about it

and Whather or not the Prisident's assassination may not have

been a part of a recrinination plan and it may just open th=

door to whether or not later on ve should decide to look irto

that.

and the

development of the capability of what euphemistically is callea

executive action.

In your professional judgment, and with your history of

your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you that

a major operation; a major intelligence gathering operation of

would be mounted under the direction of a man

about whom all I know is that ir. Harvey has a background of

something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,

I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?

Does it not suggest to you that

was in

fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination

operation with unlimited, non-voucher financial capability?

Mr. Colby. No, not that it is purely a cover.

In the first place, lit. Harvey had a very successful tour

in Berlin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which as

one of our major successful intelligence operations.

Mr. Harvey was a very coloriul figure who had his lifestyle,

which is different than some others, but he had been very

effective it that, and very adventuresome in that category of

signals intelligence and a very "enturesome idca of that nature.

Now, the thing that puts it together with this "capability"

this material, that kind of a project. In other words, a

obviously that is to be

and so forth.

Therefore, there is a system of very sharp compartmentation of

the work of that particular group.

so, given you have a man who had some good technical

experience, who is a venturesome type himself and is running a

program which is not too far off the requirements of high

compartmentation, and a very high risk kind of operation, and

therefore, for Mr. Bissel to have selected llarvey to carry out

this project seems to me that it is compatible that he could

be running

as well as this other activity.

Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second!

one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been

discussing. It was not to be put on the record although to be

done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,

but to say that thei

was only a cover I think is

probably an unwarranted conclusion.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding

of $7,500 to $10,000?

Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of

an operation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too

dittle.

Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is

largely a staff operation. In other words, you use your own

staff officers. You may hire an agent of something, but I don't

think you can draw much conclusion from the actual nurber on

the figure, one way or the other.

This might not have been the only such project. You know,

assassination project would cost you more money than that,

too.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Absolutely.

Ni. Colby. I find it hard to say that that is the only

amount of money involved. I think you got into a situation

where additional money would be put into cither of those kinds

were made to try to liquidate a freign leader, and Mr. Ha:vey

found the instrumentality, the individual to do that, and that

reguired $100,000, all he had to do was come back in and say?

Mr. Colby. He could get it.

Mr. Schwarz. I think we should have the record reflect

two things. The two gentlemen talking are not eyewitnesses to

snat ie have, been talking about.

Second, and related to that, for us to pursue this matter,

we must have, and must have right away, the better evidence

which is in the possession of the CIA, which is at least the

report of 1967; and more importantly than that,

the interview notes reflecting whatever interviers you had

would you determine with respect to five different periods

within the Central Intelligence Agency as to whather of not

the assassination attempts should continue and, second, whether

there was any discussions with persons outside of the Central

Intelligence Agency as to wiether or not the piot should continue

and the period of time would be the initial authorization, which

was March 1960, after the Bay of Pigs, during the missile

crisis. And, parenthetically there, will you state whether it

was possible Castro might have been assassinated pursuant to

an ongoing plan during a period of time when the United States

and Russia were close to a nuclear confiontation. The next.

This is related to the question I asked you about the use

Senator Mathias. Before we leave this, I have one question.

9

Chairman Church.

Senator Mathias.

10

Senator Mathias. In light of the fact this poison pen was

11

12

actually proffered on the 22nd of November, 1963, is there a

scintilla of evidence - and vas proffered to a Major in the

13

Cuban Army on active duty -- is there a scintilla of evidence

that anyone in the Cuban Government had any knowledge or suspicio

15

prior to that date that this was a project that was planned?

16

Mr. Colby. There is certainly no evidence that anyone

17

had that information with respect to the Cubella operation.

18

Mr. Breckinridge. No.

19

Mr. Colby. The second phase of the Mafia operation had been

20

wrapped up by then, I think

21

Mr. Breckinridge.

Yes.

22

Mr. Colby. The individual in Cuba involved in it had

23

take asylun, I think.

Mr. Brechinridge.

lio, the sequence is a little cifferent.

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes. There vere people who reportcily

were ant into Cuba, a team of three people - and I said roporter

because we were working then through a Cuban exile leader.

They had the assignment of recruiting additional people to

carry out such plans as might be developed. We never knew what

happened to those people - whether.they came back - only that

they were sent in.

But if you are looking for a possibility of knowledge of

assassination plot, conceivably those three people could be

the source of it, but not that the United States Government was

behind it. •

Senator Mathias. But it is conceivable that Castro and

his government could have come upon some evidence that some

plot was afoot?

Mr. Colby. He certainly could have cross allegations, and

you really must assume that various of the other kind, even

independent activities, or the first phase of the Mafia progzan

could have produced allegations of attempts against him with

the comment that CIA or the United States was behind it. The

possibility of that kind of allegation is just almost infinite.

Senator Mathias. Particularly considering the nature of

the instruments that were being deployed?

Mc. Colby. Yes, sir..

No. Breckinridge. There is another consideration."

it is safe to assume that

Castro also had reports of assassinati.

Mr. Breckinridge. Robart Maheu used to work. for tba

FBI and ha resigned from the FBI and opened a private investiga-

tive firn here in Washington ard CIA used hin from time to

tine for certain kinds of support activities.

Chairman Church. That kind of support activities?

Mr. Breckinridge. On one

occasion he obtained a famale

companion for ar important

foreign leader.

Chairnas Church, What othar kird of support?

Mr. Breckinridge. In tha early days - and this becomes

anbarrassment.

As nearly as I can recoastruct, the people

who knew him dacided to put him on a Istainer in tha office

of. Sacurity, which they did for awhile, until he as so

successful he said he no longer needed the retaines, ich is

didn't do much to earn. He later got involved rapissenting

one of the Greek shipping interests and we were given the

results of some of the information that he obtained from that

where there was a fight batrisen lliarchos and Orassis. He

think he may have had some involvement in another foreign

leadar's companionship when ha was in this country. I do=':

Mr. Breckinridge. Just bafore the first phasa anded,

Roselli, through Trafficante, was introduced to another Cuban

exile leader in Miami by the

name of Anthony Varona. Again,

his

name is a sensitive matter.

Varona was the leader of one of the groups that was being

supported by the CIA as part of the preparation for the Bay

of Pigs.

Varora was unhappy with his association, with the associatio

with the CIA. He f=lt he had not bean given enough norsy.

Varona häd pisvious contact with the crininal elament in Cuba

ha vas approached by Roselli with Trafficanta's introductio.

to tale on this mission.

Roselli's story was that he represented sona privats clini

who had intarest in Cuha. The Rosalli idencity vas appare:,

as was Trafficante's.

Varora said he kaer sonsore who was in a restaurant that

Castro frequented and then the pills were tansported again.

The pills were made in what was then

Botulinum was made into pills and these pills vera taler

When Harvey took over and then reactivated the second phas:

i= April of 1962, thay went back to Varora, and one of th=

strange things is that Varona started off wish the tao=rizion

of the original restaurant approach, which I think caussd

Chairnan Church. It is possible they went in and could

have been captured by Castro?

Mt. Breckinridge. It is possible.

The question that Senator rgan asted earliet, this they

could have krown -- these man we don't baliave could hav= krown

the actual backors of the operation, because Varora was dealing

with a mamber of the syndicate with whom he had previous

connections.

The paople who dealt with Varona felt that Bos-lli

was discret and careful.

But those men could have been capturid. Thay could have

supplied the interpretation

that they might not have krom.

Mothing cams of the oparation, it was called off, but

essentially that is the first and secord phasa.

Is it correct that "Lucky" Luciano was used

to help the Oss in connection with operations in Italy during

the Second Wold Mar?

Mr. Colby, I don't know, but I have heard that story

as well. It is an extensive story but I don't know the facts.

Mr. Schwarz. For the record, Mr. Luciano was a Mafia

figure who had been deported from the United States, or was in

jail in the United States?

Mr. Colby. Has in jail, I guess, and was later deported

after the Nar.

Now, in connection with the instructions which

you issued in 1973 concerning activitics outside of the Charter

of the CIA, you received, as we went through the other day, a

Is it the fact that, for example, between

Mr. Colby. It was included in that, yes.

Kr. Schwarz. What was the purpose of conducting such a

course?

Mr. Colby: He had a relationship with various police

departments around the country. They from time to time would

like to learn our knowledge of certain subjects that are quite

unique to the CIA. There are a nunber of things that we have

to do in CIA which are quite frankly outside the norm of nost

other agencies of the Government.

why is CIA conducting courses teaching

Mr. Colby. I think at that time, ir. Chairman, that was

at the request of the police department of that area, that they

7

were interested in this thing, and there is a defensive element

8

of it. In order to know now to protect against sorething, it

11 within the law, the basic statute which restricts your domestic

12 activities?

Mr. Colby. I don't think it is a violation of the law,

Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Colby. It could. It is an item of information that

12

13

they can use in ahy way they wish, either properly or improperly!

• Mr. Schwarz. Are you aware of any situations where govern-

14 | mental officials, either state, local or Federal, have in fact

15|

engaged in break-ins within the United States?

16

17

MI. Colby. I know of certain situations ralated to foreign:

intelligence operations where access to appropriate targets has

18 been obtained either through subterfuge of pretending to be a

19

workman or something of that nature, and I think in that history!

20

there are some cases of actual break-ins.

21

Now, I assure you, NI. Chairman, we have been conducting

22

=.

break-ins abroad. There is no question about that. That is,

23

24

ve train our people to be able to do that.

Chairman Church. That is not the question I am raising

25

with you.

other words, these courses, it is my impression, werc.

generalized discussions of technigues. They were not particular

handholding on conducting a spocific operation.

I think I am accurate in that

statement.

Mr. Smothers. Mr. Colby, just a couple of quick questions.

First, with regard to the files, memoranda or diaries you

might have of former directors, are those still on Agenci

premises?

Do you have those matters still there that were

left by former Directors?

Mr. Colby. Certain ones

we do. I don't know of any that

we don't have.

As far as I am concerned, they are Agency property, and when

I leave I am going to walk out without any paper.

Mr. Snothers. With respect then to the inguiries you have

made with regard to information in the files on assassinations,

have these inquiries extended to an examination of those files

of former- Directors?

Mr. Breckinridge.

In one or two instances on specific

points, we have made inquiries. We have not gone through the

files in general for that purpose.

MI. Colby.

We have gone through that collection I know of

Mr. Helms' files.

I don't know of any specific set of files

called Mr. ICConc's files.

There is an executive registry where my correspondence is

- Mx. Smothers. What I am searching for is the situation

where the generic classification of materials might sonchoi

have not been complete enough for us to gat particular knuvledge,

and I was wondering prior to our next meeting if a search

oriented with respect to the issue of knowledge might be a

fruitful exercise?

Mr. Colby. Knowledge by previous directors of specifics

on

this topic?

Mr. Smothers. Yes.

MI. Colby. I think it is easy for Mr. Helms. I think

we have gone through his files. I don't know of any serarate

set of files on MI. Dulles or Mr. McCone.

We will look.

Senator Hondale. There is a reference to Johr Nocone's

files in one of the menos that I looked at this morning.

Mr. COlDY. I Will check that, Senator.

Chairman Church. That is a good point, and I an glad you

have raised it.

I think we will conclude the hearing at this point with

the understanding, Mr. Colby, we will be back in touch with you.

Mr. Colby. Surely.

Chairman Church. Yes.

Senator Mondale. If they could get the Lansdale memo. -

Mr. Colby. I will do that tils afternoon.

I would like to add two things that have come to my attentio:

on the subject of assassinations; both of which are allegations,

both of which have been knocked down.

There was an allegation, some man has alleged that he was

working of conducting an assassination in Colombia, and ve have

looked into the specifics of it, and there is absolutely nothing

to it.

I thought I would mention it. I have the facts here

and will include them at some time.

There is another allegation that one of our officers

had some knowledge of an attempt against Chou In-lai, and he hasi

written me a note that points out that it is impossible for that

to have happened because he wasn't in the place at the time.

Chairman Church. Since they are allegations into which

you bave inguired, I think you should make the papers available

Mr. Colby. I will make sure the stais gets those.

• Chairman Church. Thank you very much. .

Mr. Knoche. Could I point out, I think we have the ansver

to the photographs.

There were seven of these photographs taken at different

24

angles at the sane tine, but absolutely different time intervals

25

during the tine that the police had these ren in custoly.

Mr. Knocho. I am not sure. I am not cortain for that

particular board that you were looking at.

With the blowup, they took this one of the seven photograpis

which gives the best opportunity to look at the face.

Mr. Colby. So they were separate photographs.

Chairman Church. Yes.

Mr. Knoche. I will be glad to leave that with you if you

would like to have it for your file.

(Whereupon, at 12:30 o'clock pim., the Committee

recessed subject to the

call of the Chair.)
