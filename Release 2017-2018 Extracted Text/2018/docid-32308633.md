Re Paris cable 12/28/61 and Madrid letter to

A check with the Telephone Unit, U. S. Embassy,

Paris, of long distance telephone calls made from the

Embassy, Paris, to the U. S. Embassy, Madrid, on t

12/22/61 failed to disclose any telephonic

communicatio

from any of the principal U, S. Embassy offices

at Paris

Includins the Charge d'Aftaires' office

In respect to Legat Madrid's question as to

whether Assistant Legat KEENAN recalls if the telephone

number of the direct line in the Madrid Office, 2 26 61 99

was furnished to JAVIER OCANA of the Alien Brigade of the

Directorate General of Security (DGS) during the course

of

'his investigation of the subject in November 1961, KEENAN

has

endeavored to mentally fix the transactions which too

place in instant case during the period of his assignment at

Madrid. It is his opinion that he did furnish the Alien

Brigade of the DGS the direct telephone number to the Madrid

Office, in addition to the listed number and extension.

The

decision to do so was predicated upon the belief that in

view. of the importance the Bureau attached to instant matter,

it was deemed advisable to do so in order to preclude any

possible telephonic delay or switchboard error that might be

encountered on the week end of 11/25/61 by personnel of the

DGS in the

event it was found necessary

to contact

the Madrid

Office.
