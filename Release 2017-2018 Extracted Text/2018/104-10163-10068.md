2 BARKER was born 17 March 1917 at Havana, Cuba of

. pative-born U.S. father and a Cuban mother. His birth was recorded

at the U.S. Embasoy and he was recomized as having acquired U.S.
eitézenship by birth through the cli enskip of his father. “He
traveled, not on a U.3. passport, but,on an identity card pi

his U.S, citizenship. During ‘orld War IT, he entered the Us.

citizenship. According to BARKER's recollection, this occured
4n 1953. Dr. LAZO compiled a formidable file on the Subject”
and was in communication with a Washington, D.C. legal firm,
which BARKER dimly recalls as that of Edward Bennett WILITAIS,
who was to handle the case locally. A private bill was intro=
duced in the 83rd Congress by Congressman WILLIAMS of New Jersey.
to restore the Subject's citizenship, but BARKER does not know
why no action was taken‘on the bill. At the time, he was in
financial difficulties and took a job as a tractor driver out-
side Havana for about 8 months, in which period he had no contact
with Dr. LAZO, who, as BARKER believes, interpreted his failure
to appoar in the office as a lack of interest in pressing the case
to @ successful conclusion.

8S. BARKER knows that Dr. LAZO and WILLIAMS had compited a
wery lengthy and documented file on his background, including his
wilitary record and awards from the Army Air Corps. Currently,
BARKER is traveling on a Cuban passport and is in the U.S. as an
"SP" paroled to Bernie REICHARD?.

6. The Subject pointed out that Dr. Marlo LAZO entered the
U.S. about a month ago and is now in the Washington areas he
delieves| Jis in contact with him. He knows Dr. LAZO is
familiar @ll details of his case and could confira the
ddentity of the Yashington attorney who handled the litigation
lonally. . BARKEA recalls visiting the attorney's office in Wash
dngton on one occasion, and Bennet WILLIAMS. was the name he
recalled. He believed the lawyer was involved in the Saaator
MoCarthy hearings.

7. Based on the above informtion, the following recommend-
ations ara. made:

ae 1 be requested to ascertain from fr.
Mario LAZO name of the Washington law firm which hoadied
Subject's case in 1953, and the reason for the failure of the
special bill.
