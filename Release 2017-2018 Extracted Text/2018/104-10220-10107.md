1, AMBIDDY-1 was debriefed on his relations with PRIO, As soon
as our notes have been processed, tho text of his remalkip on the subject will
be forwarded, Suffice it to say that A-1 has no understanding with and no
respect for PRIO. He would, however, accept PRIO!s monsy, with no etrings
attached, on the theory that it {s Cuban property returned to its rightful
custodian, i.e., AMBIDDY-~1.

2, Av HOS sees it, PRIO's main role is one of creating a nuisance
and of rendering A-1's political problema in Nicaragua alightly more com-
plicated. If WAVE can see a secure means of putting a spoke in PRIO's
wheels, ite efforta along those lines would bo appreciated. It would patpably
suffice to drop some hints to the effect that responsible and competent
observers view PRIO as a hau-been and refuse to take his leadership

aspirations seriously.

3. For Mexico Station: May wa request that you air the above
thame in a widely read column, making the following pointe:

a. Allude to reports that PRIO and BBACERB-I and ©
ERACORN-1 have reached an undorstanding whereby VRIG will
be eccognized au leader of the resistance against Cuba.

b. Pay BRACERB-I and ERACORN-I the left-handed
compliment that thoy are uniikely to hitch thelr wagon to the
vanishiag star of PIUO.

c. Suggest that PRIO could render one vital contribution,
viz. cough up eame of the milliung ho stole from the Cuban people
while prasident, As for tho rest, he should lapae inte silence
and ist respectable peaple do tho job.

d. State that some of PRIO's henchmen have been dropping

that, without being privy to ODEARL views, {t would be sur~
prising iudeed were PRIO considered by anyone in leading ODYOKE
position anything but a painful reminder that abuves of public trust
had something to do with the auccess of Castro's revolution,
