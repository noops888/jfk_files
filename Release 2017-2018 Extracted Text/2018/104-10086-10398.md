1. On2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited the Warrenton] Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man''. We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:

REPRODUCTION PROHIBITED

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (see attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

“ graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of ©
the block south. It had a Planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy Compound.
This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by. a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early (1959) due to the resig- ;
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and Mane was

‘processed on the | outside by a recruited ‘agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

Army officers In 1961, (because of mismanagement. by the Mexican” prin-

Ccipals} the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

S. Qavaé toveras: REPRODUCTION. PROHIBIT!

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (tha

goint. fap_operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage. The Station immediately

@isconnected all of the unilateral telephone taps on these Embassies so)

wthat they would not be discovered when the Mexicans “hooked up their)

ee ‘taps. The Mexicans]soon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian



eg

‘y a@ language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location
for translation and typing. . Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date ‘of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviét Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening al] photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete rol] of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
| Photograph all Soviets, their families, al] foreigners, and cars with
| foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents
were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed niechanical dif-

27 September 1963, Soviet Enbassy Chancery 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue ms a here (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington. Ye’ ingly this man
(the American), ~~": showed him a le Which he (the

i n in favor of Cuba

‘or the answer from

American) is a member. of an orga
and said that the Cubans could x

with him, because he has to #
Washington.
DURAN: ..with them also, becau;
is that he doesn't k

roblem with him (the Anerican)
tyone in Cuba and in that case it
: is very difficult im a visa, because.he was
bisa thinking of proc is visa, becatise he knew it was
going to take ‘ime waiting for the Russian visa in
&

Cuba, and t! to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the, that if his (the American) wife were

” now in W. m (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from. the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this. visa, she can commmicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can-only give thé visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It.was-no bother, thank you very much.

27 September 1963, Sovict Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate’ at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas.to go to Odessa.- He is told to call back at.1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside: the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he isin the Russian Embassy and or
Ie
%

know what day the boat."KALONIA" will arrive in Odess:
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger i 5
oy

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN €#tchipsing representatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed rou Avil information. First
a-call was made to the first list: 5 wiet Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (whi Wout to be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number * isulate and the address. After
making a call to the Co S earning that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALAS it to the address to get the needed
information.) é

+ Item 395, pages 7-and 8 : i ia

Just after 1600 hours, the ‘Soviet Consulate received a.call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he: spoke at. the Soviet Embassy
because she’ sent him over to.them. telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Iiimigration in Cuba. She wants ~
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem." The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘his
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a-change of “address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.
