CROZIER, Ross
SUBJECT: gap. 569

Re the correspondence commencing with the memo dated 15 September
1961 to Career Agent Panel concerning assignment of Subject to JMWAVE,
For the past 2-3 months I have made numerous inquiries to WH/4 Security
regarding this matter in an attempt to get the appropriate WH officials
to clarify the sitiation as to whether or not the use of the Subject at
JMWAVE had been approved by some appropriate"Panel" without getting 0S

: approval,and also to have a initiated in this regard to 0S,

On this aa CPD, called me and wanted to know
the status of any se: Y approval action. I advised her that we never
received a request for approval of Subject as indicated and I asked her
if she knew whethbr or not the use had been approved-elsewhere. She said
her records indicated the use had been approved bakk in September by the
Agent's Panel and she would send me a memo concerning this right away, I
restated to her the fact that the use of Subject as indicated appears to
be in violation of former OS restrictions as set out on 2 March 1960, She
