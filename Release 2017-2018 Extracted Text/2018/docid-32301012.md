NEUTRALITY MATTERS
- :

Preyious investigation has reflected that the

_Dr. TIA, a Cuban medical doctor residing 7
at 2121 Southwest lith Street, Miami/Z#BOSCH claimed credit i
in August and September of 1963 for several bombing raids
over targets in Cuba. He claimed that these raids were
from bases outside the United States.

On December 11, 1963, MM T-1, a Cuban exile who
has been involved in anti-CASTRO activity for several years,
advised that Dr. ORIANDO BOSCH AVIIA is now. planning a
bombing raid, tentatively scheduled for the night of
December 14 or 15, 1963 from Bimini, Bahama Islands. The:
target will be an oil refinery at Nuevitas in the northern
part of Camaguey Province, Cuba.

MM T-1 said that BOSCH has made arrangements
through an American businessman, identity unknown to
MM T-1, who was a prisoner of the CASTRO regime in 1959,
to buy or rent a twin-engine Beechcraft airplane, which,
according to BOSCH,is presently located at Orlando,
Florida. BOSCH has propositioned a Cuban pilot to fly
this plane on the raid, and has made arrangements for this !
pilot to practice with a similar type Beechcraft plane. at

RE: MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL DE
RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (MIRR)

MM T-1 stated BOSCH has disclosed he is paying
an American pilot, name unknown to MM T-1, to transport
the twin-engine Beechcraft from Orlando, Florida ; to Bimini
on an ostensible pleasure flight. TheAmerican pilot will
be accompanied by his wife or girl friend, and after landing
at the Bimini air field, which is located on an-island
adjacent to the town of Bimini, the American pilot and
his companion will register at a hotel in Bimini. MM T-1 did
not know the scheduled time of their departure from Orlando,
Florida, but presumed it would be earlier the same day on
which the bombing raid is scheduled, or possibly a day or
two earlier.

MM T-1 said that BOSCH has arranged to transport,
by a small, fast boat, the pilot, co-pilot and two other fie
crewmen, identities unknown to MM T-1, from Miami to the
airstrip at Bimini. They will be scheduled to arrive under
cover of darkness on the night of the bombing raid. Seven
or eight 50-pound demolition bombs will-be used in the raid.
MM T-1 presumed that these bombs will be transported in the
boat taking the pilot and his companions from the Miami
area to Bimini.

Previous investigation has disclosed that the Bimini
Airport is customarily not manned by any airport officials after
sundown, and it is possible for planes to take off and land
there under cover of darkness without being cleared or
observed.

BOSCH, according to MM T-1, has planned that the
pilot, co- pilot and the two crewmen will load the bombs '
on the twin-engine Beechcraft plane, under cover of darkness, !
at the Bimini Airport, and will take off at 1:00 AM, bomb the :
target at Nuevitas, Cuba, at approximately 3:30 AM, and then
return to Bimini at 6:00 AM. The pilot, co-pilot and two

crewmen will place the plane in the same place where it had
been left by the American pilot, and will then depart,
still under cover of darkness, by boat, and return to the
Miami area, Pate

MM T-1 possessed no information concerning the
exact identity or ownership of the twin-engine Beechcraft
which will be used on the raid, or the location and identity
of the boat which will be used in transporting. the men from
Miami to Bimini and back again. Also, he possessed no
information concerning the present location of the bombs.

He said BOSCH is not scheduled to participate in the raid.
