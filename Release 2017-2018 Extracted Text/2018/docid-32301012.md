FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Miami, Florida

December 12, 1963

RE:

MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL DE

RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (MIRR)

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA;

NEUTRALITY MATTERS

Preylous investigation has reflected that the

Movimiento Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR)

is an anti-CASTRO action group under the leadership of

DI. ORIANDO BOSCHAVILA, a Cuban medical doctor residing

at 2121 Southwest 11th Street, MiamiEZABOSCH claimed credit

in August and September of 1963 for several bombing raids

over targets in Cuba.

He claimed that these raids were

from bases outside the United States.

On December 11, 1963, MM 1-1, a Cuban exile who

has been involved in anti-CASTRO activity for several years,

advised that DI. ORIANDO BOSCH AVIIA is now planning a

bombing raid, tentatively scheduled for the night of

December 14 or 15, 1963 from Bimini, Bahama Islands•

The

target will be an oil refinery at Nuevitas in the northern

part of Camaguey Province, Cuba.

MM T-1 said that BOSCH has made arrangements

through an American businessman, identity unknown to

MM T-1, who was a prisoner of the CASTRO regime in 1959,

to buy

' or rent a twin-engine Beechcraft aixplane, which,

according to BOSCH, is presently located at Orlando,

Florida. BOSCH has propositioned a Cuban pilot to

• fly

this plane on the raid, and has made arrangements for this

pilot to practice with

a similar type Beecheraft plane.

RE :

MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL DE

RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (MIRR)

MM T-1 stated BOSCH has disclosed he is paying

an American pilot, name unknown to MM I-1, to transport

the twin-engine Beechcraft from Orlando, Florida, to Bimini

on an ostensible pleasure flight.

The American pilot will

be accompanied by his wife or girl friend, and after landing

at the Bimini air field, which is located on an island

adjacent to the town of Bimini, the American pilot and

his companion will register at a hotel in Bimini. MMI-1 did

not know the scheduled time of their departure from Orlando,

Florida, but presumed it would be earlier the same day on

which the bombing raid is scheduled, or possibly a day or

two earlier.

MM T-1 said that BOSCH has arranged to transport,

by a small, fast boat, the pilot, co-pilot and two other

crewmen, identities unknown to MM T-1, from Miami to the

airstrip at Bimini. They will be scheduled to arrive under

cover of darkness on the night of the bombing raid. Seven

or eight 50-pound demolition bombs will be used in the raid.

MM T-1 presumed that these bombs will be transported in the

boat taking the pilot and his companions from the Miami

area to Bimini.

Previous

investigation has disclosed that the Bimini

Airport is customarily not manned by any airport officials after

sundown, and it is possible for planes to take off and land

there under cover of darkness without being cleared or

observed.

BOSCH, according to MM T-1, has planned that the

pilot, co-pilot

and the two crewmen will load the bombs

on the twin-engine Beechcraft plane, under cover of darkness,

at the Bimini Airport, and will take off at 1:00 AM, bomb the

target at Nuevitas, Cuba, at approximately 3:30 AM, and then

return to Bimini at 6:00

AM. The pilot, co-pilot and two

RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (MIRR)

crewmen will place the plane in the same place where it had

been left by the American pilot, and will then depart,

still under cover of darkness, by boat, and return to the

Miami area.

MM T-l possessed no information concerning the

exact identity or ownership of the twin-engine Beechcraft

which will be used on the raid, or the location and identity

of the boat which will be used in transporting the men from

Miami to Bimini and back again. Also, he possessed no

information concerning the present location of the bombs.

He said BOSCH is not scheduled to participate in the raid.
