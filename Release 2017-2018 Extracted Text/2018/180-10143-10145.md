with whom he worked, were excellent. He said that he ran the LITEMPO
project and that Phillip Agee's presentation of this project is
accurate. This was the only project that he worked on during his
whole tenure with the CIA in Mexico.. The only people who knew of

his role in Station operations was Win Scott and Ann Goodpasture.

Mr. Munro did not believe that they would have known what he was doing.
Mr. Munro added that David Phillips was a very close friend and would
have also known what he was doing.

Mr. Munro stated that it was his personal belief. that Oswald
was a Cuban agent and that his trip to Mexico had been an attempt to
lay an escape route. He stated that this belief was based only on
logic and inferences from his discussions with Rolf Larson and that
he had no knowledge about the trip or Oswald that was not in the
public domain.

Mr. Munro denied having anything to do with the arrest of
Silvia Duran and claimed that he had no knowledge whatsoever about

the arrest. He stated that on important matters Win Scott usually

operator. He said that Ann Goodpasture was one of the best case officers
