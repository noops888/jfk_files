‘Continuing disclosures by the Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence drama- .

tize to the American people how exces-
sive and illegal certain CIA and FBI sur-
veillance practices became during the
fading Cold War years.

Apparently the systematic opening of
foreign mail to and from Americans by
the CIA, as well as the FBI’s burglary
break-ins or “black bag jobs,” had been
stopped quite a while ago — as they
certainly should have been.

But with Americans now well alerted
to this threat to their own liberties, there
can be no excuse for avoiding effective
new restraints to correct past mistakes
and prevent a recurrence, of these
abuses.. .. +. .

Earlier this yeat, the Rockefeller CIA
panel disclosed the 20-year program of
mail openings, which it branded as
“unlawful” and raising ‘‘constitutional
questions under the Fourth Amendment”
barring unreasonable search and sei-
zure. But a Senate committee has now
added such details as Sen. Church's dis-
covery in his own CIA files of a copy of a
letter he had sent from Russia to his
mother-in;law in Idaho in 1971.

More ‘disturbing ‘is the disclosure
that the FBI between 1942 and 1968 con-
ducted 238 break-in burglaries against 14
unnamed “domestic security targets,”

various other individuals and groups.
What this means is that the FBI, with-
out benefit of any court warrant as re-
quired under the Fourth Amendment,
broke into homes and offices and

_ presumably rummaged through private

files, letters and other belongings. To put
it bluntly, the FBI in such cases, wheth- .
er with or without the support of higher
autority brazenly ignored the Bal wot
Rights,

We realize, of course, ‘that « attitudes
and conditions have changed..The break-
ins began in wartime. That they persist-
ed long afterwards, however, documents
the inadequacies of legal restraints, and
the dangers of the irresponsible attitude
of “go do it, but don’t tell me about it.”

More important than assessing blame

or hooting at ironies is the imperative of

preventing similar perils in the future.
The country needs better laws, more
effective accountability of these agencies
to elected officials and a much greater
alertness on their part to the dangers
posed by surveillance excesses to Ameri-
can liberties,

The U. S. must have first-rate intelli-
gence capability at home and abroad. It
needs a strong and effective FBI and CIA
in the national interest. But it must de-
vise strict guidelines that confine this

“ capability within lawful and ‘constitution-

not to mention uncounted others against al boundaries.

Mr.

By William Safire

WASHINGON, Noy, 19—On Oct. 10,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United States put his personal signa-
ture on a document that launched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.

In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-

tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther ©

King Jr. is being gingerly examined,

with the “investigation” conducted in

such a way as not to unduly em-

} barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has
focused on the F.B.I, Yesterday, whent
the committee counsel first set forth

- the result of shuffling through press

witness pointed out that it
was ert Kennedy who authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed

| their concern of Communist influence

with Dr, King.”

But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nedy root of precedent to Water-
gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church
were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-

. edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questions that have gone unasked for

+ thirteen years,

For example, he could call Nicholas
|. Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-

ion to witetap Dr, King. Who at

Justice concurred in the recommenda-

tion? How does the F.B.I. know the 4

President was consulted or informed?
After Mr, Katzenbach assumed of-*

fice, and the wiretapping continued, |
he was told by angry newsmen that
the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr, King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis«
continue the officially approved tap?
Of course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church’s political
hase. That is why .e do not see for~
mer Assistant F director Cartha
(Deke) ach, Lyadon Johnson's

persoaal contact with the FBI. in the
i did President

wit chair, What
Rnson know about

it? What conversations tock
place between Mr. Deioach and Presi«
dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.

Church's, Cover-Up

clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-§
partment had existed in 1962; today,

@ committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are readily available. A couple of
Weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
FBI. man inadvertently started to
blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 with

. the apparent knowledge of Attorn

General Kennedy. The too-willing wit;

ness was promptly shooshed into si
lence, and told that such information!
would be developed only in executive
session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern of containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican and Democratic con-
Peis datas aieeainan ela

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of poli

cal headquarters were worse than the

crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the “FBI,
but the Chirch investigators seem to
be determinett not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.I. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.BJ. to spy on political
opponents, who can be brought for-
ward to tell us all about it?

But that. would cause embarrass-
ment to Democrats,

Church wants to embarrass profes-
investigatory

sional employees of
agencies only. A new

management of NBC News gave press

convention, everybody blushes demure-;

T have been haranguing patient”
readers for years about tke double
standard applied to Democratic and
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would be iaid
before the public in damning detail.
Obviously, Democrat Fr:

Specifically, what instructions did you
give her?

I told her to become a member of the
Buffalo Chapter of the VVAW in order
that she might gather information
concerning violent or radical activities
engaged in by the organization.

What specific area was Miss Cook assigned
to work in?

Initially she became a member of the
women's group of the VVAW.

background information concerning
individuals in the group?

i told her to obtain information concerning
members of the VVAW.

The VVAW did not have membership cards

as such, however, I considered a

person who attends meetings of the Chapter
or gives financial or other support to be
a member of the organization.

What type of background information did
she obtain?

She obtained physical deseriptions and
other types of background information
such as residences or employment which
would allow me to differentiate between
that individual and other individuals
in the Buffalo area.

Miss Cook stated that the objectives of
the VVAW were as follows:

To end the war in Viet Nam, to obtain
better veteran's benefits, to upgrade
bad conduct discharges, to obtain
drug treatment for veterans. Is this
correct?

I believe they embraced those objectives
but they also had others.

What were the other objectives?

As she described them, the destruction of
U. S. imperialism and the replacement of
our form of government with a socialist
government, probably modeled after the
government of Red China.

Did the VVAW ever engage in violent
activities?

Yes.
Could you cite some examples?

The first meeting she attended, for
example, concerned the planning of a
disruption of a U. S, Marine Corps
Armed Forces Day display in Buffalo. On
other oceasions actions were planned
which were illegal and disruptive.

Can you give any examples of violent
activities by individual members?

I recall on one oceasion several members

in this organization told Miss Cook

that they felt the actions of an individual

who was arrested for a bombing on the

University of Michigan campus which resulted in
death, were justified for political purposes.

Do you know of any violent activities
that VVAW members actually engaged in
since the foregoing could possibly be

. WAW have physically assualted members of other
subversive groups in the Buffalo area.

Miss Cook has indicated that you told
her that you were interested in attempts
by other groups to take over the VVA‘/.
Did this ever happen?

According to information provided by
Miss Cook, the Revolutionary Union
(Characterization of which is contained
in appendix hereto) was attempting to
take over the VVAW. I was interested
in this.

What is the Revolutionary Union?

The Revolutionary Union is a Maoist
subversive group.

Was the Revolutionary Union attempting
to take over the Buffalo Chapter?

According to Miss Cook, they were trying
to take over chapters in several areas

of the country and she said that they were
taking over the New York City chapter,
however, I cannot recall specific attempts
to take over the Buffalo chapter while

I was handling Miss Cook.

Did the Revolutionary Union ever take
over the VVAW?

I cannot answer that within the scope

Did you consider the VVAW to be a
subversive organization?

Yes
Do you know anything about "Cointelpro"?

Did you ever use information provided
by Mary Jo Cook in any cointelpro-typé
activities such as getting members of
VVAW fired from their jobs or telling
the parents of members?

No I did not.

Did you ever take any actions against
Mary Jo Cook or her family?

No I did not.

Did you ever engage in any disruptive
or neutralizing action against the
organization?

I engaged in no disruptive activities,
however, if I learned that the organization
was planning something illegal I would

alert the local authorities and sufficient
police officers would appear at the scene to
prevent trouble. I feel this neutralized any
planned illegality by the VVAW.

Did Miss Cook ever provide you with
mailing lists of the organization?

Miss Cook provided me with any number of
lists, whether they were described as
mailing lists or membership lists, I
eannot recall.

Did she ever provide you with any
contribution lists of the organization?

Not that I can recall.

What did you do with the names that
were contained on these lists?

I would review the Lists to determine
if there was anything significant
contained in them and a great deal of
them I would do nothing with and merely
return the lists to Miss Cook. She
provided me with a lot of material that
I had no interest in.

Did she ever provide you with a

Not that I ean recall

Did she ever give you any information
concerning VVAW defense strategies?

I believe she gave me material such

as reprints of articles from "Psychology
Today" and from a magazine called,
"Counter Spy" and other information of
that nature.

Did she tell you that she was working
with the Attica Defense Committee?

Yes
What is the Attica Defense Committee?

It is an umbrella-type organization

in which individuals who are interested
in defending Attica prisoners as well
as individuals seeking their own ends
have gotten together.

Did Miss Cook ever indicate that the

VVAW was a conduit of mail between

the Attica Defense Committee and prisoners

What was the method of her providing

She would provide me with information
either in person or by telephone, which
I would dictate to a stenographer, have
reduced to writing and have her sign.

Did these reports contain background
information regarding individuals?

POSTAL She stated that on occasion you provided
her with a list of questions which she
said came from Washington and sometimes
she did not understand the questions.

LASH On oceasion I would ask her questions
about the organization. I never gave
her any list of questions that I said
came from Washington. On several
oceasions I told her, in response to
her questions, that the information she
provided was sometimes sent to Washington
since it pertained to VVAW nationally.

I pointed out that this should calm

her fears that the FBI might be

getting information from informants who
are not telling the true story about
the VVAW. I aiso pointed out to her
that her information being accurate
would in fact offset any mis—information
that might come from another informant.

reports?

and provided reports on activities in
these cities.

other Agents?

provided to the attendees at conventions.

Some of these were pamphlets describing

VVAW activities, copies of VVAW newspapers,
flyers concerning demonstrations and activities
in other VVAW chapters, ete.

POSTAL What was the method of payment for Miss Cook's
services?

LASH Miss Cook was paid on a COD basis for
information provided.

POSTAL Was she paid a salary?

LASH No

POSTAL What determined the amount that she was

paid monthly?

LASH She was paid on a monthly basis COD for
information provided. Inasmuch as she
provided a good deal of information every
month, she was usually paid the maximum
amount permitted by FBI Headquarters,
therefore monthly payments often totaled
similar amounts.

POSTAL Was she instructed to pay income tax?

LASH She was advised to treat all money
she received from the Bureau as income
and to pay appropriate taxes.

POSTAL Was she given any instructions on how
to report her income from the FBI?

LASH I cannot recall giving her any specific
instructions, however, if I had I would
have instructed her to report it as
miscellaneous income or income from
self-employment, something of that nature.

POSTAL Were these instructions to conceal the
facet that she was reeeiving money from
confidential FBI funds?

No. This would have been to conceal
the fact that she was an FBI informant.

Did you get Mary Jo Cook a job?
I aided her in finding employment.
What were the circumstances?

Miss Cook indicated that she was being
eriticized by members of her group

for being a “lLumpen proletariat" (PH)
for not being gainfully employed.

This is a Marxist term for anyone
being supported by their parents

or Welfare, ete. She indicated that
it would be necessary for her to find
a job and I contacted a social
acquaintance of mine who is employed
by a Buffalo area bank, who advised that
the bank is always looking for tellers.
I advised Miss Cook to go to the bank.
She did and she got a job as a teller,

Did Mary Jo Cook feel she was an
Agent Provacateur?

No. On the contrary, I feel if anything

she was a non-provacateur since I

instructed her to act in such a way as to
prevent any violent or illegal act that might
be discussed in her presence. I think she
understood this and acted in this way.

Why did Mary Jo Cook act as an informant?

Mary Jo Cook was an actual member of the
VVAW as well as being an informant for the
FBI. She reconciled this in her mind

by feeling that she was providing

the FBI with information that was objective
and true about the organization, as well as
preventing violent individuals from taking
over the group.

What percentage of the group did you feel
was violence prone?

I do not think I can answer that.

You cannot give some approximation?

Aecording to Miss Cook there were
individuals who were not interested at all
in violence, as well as individuals who were
interested in taking up the gun and
fighting in the streets as a defensive
measure assuming that a violent revolution
would be started by the establishment.

There were also individuals who were
interested in initiating violence themselves
to bring about their political goals.

What percentage of the group each of

these factions represented, I cannot say.

Could you indicate the number of
violent activities that the VVAW was
involved in during the period you
handled Mary Jo Cook?

I cannot recall.
Was it 2 or 25?
Between 2 and 25.

Mary Jo Cook indicated that the VVAW members
were the most loving and good people she
has ever met. Did she ever indicate that
you you?

Yes.

If she indicated that these people
were so loving and good, how did
you feel that they could engage in
acts of violence.

I do not mean to be facetious, but

IT have read that the "Charles Manson
family" in California claim to love
each other and are very interested

in ecology and other good things.

But I believe they certainly seem

to be capable of engaging in violence,

Miss Cook indicates that she felt
there were other informants in the
group. Did you ever discuss other
informants with her?

On one occasion an individual came to Buffalo
from another part of New York state

who was suspected of being an informant.

The group wanted to take action against him,
however Mary Jo Cook told them they

should take no action, but rather should
check with VVAW members in his home area to
determine if he was an informant.

I believe at the time it was necessary

for me to ask her about this situation
immediately after it happened and she
therefore suspected we had other

informants in the organization.

Did you indicate to her that if she

were to quit you would put other informants
in the organization who would possibly

not be as truthful about the VVAW

as she was?

Yes. I believe I did indicate this to her.
Why did she quit?

Because she indicated that she was having
nightmares and suffering actual physical
afflictions due to her fears of being
discovered as an informant.

She has indicated that she has had
long political discussions with you
where you disagreed with her on
political issues. Is this correct?

Yes, this is correct.
What prompted these discussions?

She indicated on many occasions that
as a member of the VVAW she was only
hearing political perspective from the
far left. She asked that I present
her with an alternative perspective
which I attempted to do. I attempted
to point out that there are two sides

to every question.

For example,

I vecali on one occasion she was told
by the VVAW that Bethlehem Steel in
the Buffalo area had permitted a worker
to die rather than shut down a blast
furnace after a worker had fallen

dowm into the furnace area. I checked

on this and told her that the true story
was that the worker had had a fatal heart
attack before falling into the dangerous
area and that immediately after his fall
everything was shut down for his rescue.

Did she indicate to you that she was
especially concerned about the atrocities
at Attica Prison?

Yes, she did.

Did you ever indicate to her that you
talked to someone who had been there
and said there were no atrocities?

I indicated to her that I had talked
to a physician who had been there
after the rebellion had been ,put down
who had told me that the individuals
he treated had been injured during the
period the prison was in the hands of
the rebellious inmates and not during
the suppression of the riot.

Did she ever discuss political parties
with you?

The only thing I can recall is her telling
me that at some time in the future the
VVAW will be a grassroots socialist party
in the United States.

Did she mention an individual named
Martin Solestry (PH)?

Do you mean Martin Sostre?
Who is he?

VIETNAM VETERANS AGAINST THE WAR/
WINTER SOLDIER ORGANIZATION

fhe Vietnam Veterans Against -the War, formed in
1967 by Vietnam veterans to protest United States involve~
ment in the war in Southeast Asia (changed name to Vietnam
Veterans Against the War/Winter Soldier Organization (VVAW/
WSO) in 1973 to include non-veterans as members), has spon-
sored numerous anti~government demonstrations, some resulting
in violence. The VVAW/WSO National Office (NO) and some key
chapters are infiltrated and influenced by the militant Revolu-
tionary Union (RU) organization, and VVAW/WSO leaders have told
members that VVAW/WSO is a revolutionary organization, not "just
another group of war veterans."'. The current Marxist-Leninist-
Maoist oriented NO, which promotes education of the membership
in Marxist-Leninist-Maoist doctrine and directs the organiza
into political growth along the same lines, has at VVAW/WSO
National Steering Committee Meetings (SCM) , in 1974, portrayed
VVAW/WSO as a mass anti-imperialist organization and a vanguard
of the revolution eventually created by the masses,

VVAW/WSO leaders voted at the December, 1574 NSCM to
align VVAW/WSO with the RU, which-oerganizatiion follows a strict
Maoist line designed to bring about violent revolution in the
United States. : ae -

ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR -~

DEPUTY ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JAMES B. ADAMS

TESTIFYING BEFORE THE

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

PERTAINING TO THE KU KLUX KLAN,

GARY ROWE, FORMER FBI INFORMANT, AND

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS OF THE FBI

TO PREVENT VIOLENCE

DECEMBER 2, 1975

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 41



QUESTION: +++-You do use informants and do instruct them to
spread dissention among certain groups that they are
informing on, do you not?

MR. ADAMS: We did when we had the COINTEL programs which were
discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably one
of the best examples of a situation where the law was
ineffective at the time. We heard the term, State's Rights
used much more than we hear today. We saw with the
Little Rock situation the President of the United States
sending in the troops pointing out the necessity to use
local law enforcement. We must have local law enforcement
use the troops only as a last resort. When you have a
situation like this where you do try to preserve the
respective roles in law enforcement, you have historical
problems.

With the Klan coming along, we had situations where
the FBI and the Federal Government was almost powerless
to act. We had local law enforcement officers in some
areas participating in Klan violence. The incidents
mentioned by Mr. Rowe--everyone of those he saw them from the
lowest level--the informant. He didn't see what action
was taken with that information as he pointed out during
his testimony. Our files show that this information was
reported to the police departments in every instance.

We also know that in certain instances the infor-
mation upon being received was not being acted upon. We

also disseminated simultaneously through letterhead

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 42



memorandum to the Department of Justice the problem.

And here we were--the FBI--in a position where we had no
authority in the absence of an instruction from the
Department of Justice to make an arrest. Section 241
and 242 don't cover it because you don't have evidence

of a conspiracy. It ultimately resulted in a situation
where the Department called in U. S. Marshals who do have
authority similar to local law enforcement officials.

So historically, in those days, we were just as
frustrated as anyone else was, that when we got information
from someone like Mr. Rowe--good information, reliable
information-~and it was passed on to those who had the
responsibility to do something about it, it was not always
acted upon as he indicated.

QUESTION: , In none of these cases, then, there was adequate
evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to act.

MR. ADAMS: The Departmental rules at that time, and still do,
require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.
Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together.
You can have a mob scene and you can have blacks and whites
belting each other, but unless you can show that those that

initiated the action acted in concert, in a conspiracy, you

have no violation. |
Congress recognized this and it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the Civil

Rights Statute which added punitive measures against an

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 43



individual. There didn't have to be a conspiracy. This
was a problem that the whole country was grappling with--
the President of the United States, Attorneys General--we
were in a situation where we had rank lawlessness taking
place. As you know from the memorandum we sent you that
we sent to the Attorney General the accomplishments we were
able to obtain in preventing violence and in neutralizing
the Klan and that was one of the reasons.

QUESTION: «.--A local town meeting on a controversial social
issue might result in disruption. It might be by hecklers
rather than by those holding the meeting. Does this
mean that the Bureau should investigate all groups
organizing or participating in such meetings because
they may result in violent government disruption?

MR ADAMS: No sir, and we don‘'t....

QUESTION: Isn't that how you justify spying on almost every
aspect of the peace movement?

MR. ADAMS: No sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we monitor

demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have
an investigative interest in, a valid investigative
interest in, or where members of one of these groups are
participating where there is a potential that they might
change the peaceful nature of the demonstration.

This is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing

on the lst Amendment right, yet at the same time, being

ange Sane

NW 54965 DoclId:32989503 Page 44


aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers

in the past than we do at the present time. We have had
periods where the demonstrations have been rather severe
and the courts have said that the FBI has the right,

and indeed the duty, to keep itself informed with respect
to the possible commission of crime. It is not obliged
to wear blinders until it may be too late for prevention.
Now that's a good statement if applied in a clear-cut
case,

Our problem is where we have a demonstration and
we have to make a judgment call as to whether it is one
that clearly fits the criteria of enabling us to monitor
the activities. That's where I think most of our disagree-
ments fall.

QUESTION: In the Rowe Case, in the Rowe testimony that we just
heard, what was the rationale again for not intervening when
violence was known about. I know we have asked this several
times--I'm still having trouble understanding what the
rationale, Mr. Wannall, was in not intervening in the Rowe
situation when violence was known.

MR. WANNALL: Senator Schweiker, Mr. Adams did address himself to
that and if you have no objections, I'll ask that he be
the one to answer the question.

MR. ADAMS: The problem we had at the time, and it is the problem
today, we are an investigative agency; we do not have

police powers even like the U. S. Marshals do. The Marshals

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 45



NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 46

since about 1795 I guess, or some period like that, had
authorities that almost border on what a sheriff has. We
are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice,
and during these times the Department of Justice had us
maintain the role of an investigative agency.

We were to report on activities. We furnished the
information to the local police who had an obligation to
act. We furnished it to the Department of Justice in those
areas where the local police did not act. It resulted
finally in the Attorney General sending 500 U. S. Marshals
down to guarantee the safety of people who were trying to
march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at
a time of Civil Rights versus Federal Rights and yet’ there
was a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the
country. This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement
agencies in the South at the time either, because many of
them did act upon the information that was furnished to
them. But we have no authority to make an arrest on the
spot because we would not have had evidence that was a
conspiracy available. We could do absolutely nothing in
that regard. In Little Rock the decision was made, for
instance, that if any arrests need to be made, the Army
should make them. And next to the Army, the U. S. Marshals
should make them--not the FBI, even though we developed

the violations. We have over the years as you know at the

-5-



Time there were many questions raised. Why doesn't the
FBI stop this? Why don't you do something about it? Well,
. we took the other route and effectively destroyed the Klan
as far as committing acts of violence and, of course, we
exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

QUESTION: What would be wrong, just following up on your point
there, Mr. Adams, with setting up a program since it is
obvious to me that a lot of our informers are going to
have preknowledge of violence of using U. S. Marshals on
some kind of Tongerange basis to prevent violence?

MR. ADAMS: We do. We have them in Boston in connection with
the busing incident. We are investigating the violations
under the Civil Rights Act, but the Marshals are in ;
Boston. They are in Louisville, I believe, at the same
time and this is the approach that the Federal Government
finally recognized.

QUESTION: On an immediate and fairly contemporary basis that
kind of help can be sought instantly as opposed to waiting
till it gets to a Boston state. I realize a departure from
the past and not saying it isn't, but it seems to me we need
a better remedy than we have.

MR ADAMS: Well, fortunately we are at a time where conditions have
subsided in the country even from the 60's and the 70's, or
50's and 60's. We report to the Department of Justice on
potential trouble spots around the country as we learn of them

so that the Department will be aware of them. The planning

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR.

ADAMS:

for Boston, for instance, took’ place a year in advance, with
state officials, city officials, the Department of Justice

and the FBI sitting down together saying "How are we going to
protect the situation in Boston"? I think we have learned a
lot from the days back in the early 60's. But, the Government
had no mechanics which protected people at that. time.

Next I would like to ask, back in 1965, I guess during
the height of the effort to destroy the Klans as you put it
a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released figures that
we had something like 2,000 informers of some kind or another
infiltrating the Klan out of roughly 10,000 estimated member-
ship.

That's right.

I believe these are FBI figures or estimates. ‘That would
mean that 1 out of every 5 members of the Klan at that point
was an informant paid by the Government and I believe the
figure goes on to indicate that 70 percent of the new members
in the Klan that year were FBI informants. Isn't that an
awful overwhelming quantity of people to put in an effort such
as that? I'm not criticizing that we shouldn't have informants
in the Klan and know what is going on to revert violence but it
just seems to me that the tail is sort of wagging the dog. For
example today we supposedly have only 1594 total informants,
both domestic informants and potential informants. Yet, here
we have 2,000 in just the Klan alone.

Well, this number of 2,000 did include all racial matters

and informants at that particular time and I think the figures

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 48 -7T-



QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

we tried to reconstruct as to the actual number of Klan
informants in relaton to Klan members was around 6 percent, I
think after we had read some of the testimony on it. Isn't that
right, Bill? Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan
had a group called the Action Group. This was the group if you
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony that he was left out of in
the beginning. He attended the open meetings and heard all the
hoorahs and this type of information but he never knew what was
going on because each one had an Action Group that went out and
considered themselves in the missionary field. Theirs was the
violence. In order to penetrate those you have to direct as
many informants as you possibly can against it. Bear in mind
that I think the newspapers, the President, Congress, everyone,
was concerned about the murder of the three civil rights
workers, the Lemul Penn case, the Violet Liuzzo case, the
bombings of the church in Birmingham. We were faced with one
tremendous problem at that time.

I acknowledge that.

Our only approach was through informants. Through the
use of informants we solved these cases. The ones that were
solved. There were some of the bombing cases we never solved.
They're extremely difficult, but, these informants as we told
the Attorney General and as we told the President, we moved
informants like Mr. Rowe up to the top leadership. He was the
bodyguard to the head man. He was in a position where he

could see that this could continue forever unless we could

NW 54965 Docld:32989503 Page 49 -8-



create enough disruption that these members will realize that
if I go out and murder three civil rights, even though the
Sheriff and other law enforcement officers are in on it, if
that were the case, and in some of that was the case, that I
will be caught, and that's what we did, and that's why violence
stopped because the Klan was insecure and just like you say

20 percent, they thought 50 percent of their members ultimately
were Klan members, and they didn't dare engage in these acts of
violence because they knew they couldn't control the conspiracy
any longer.

QUESTION: I just have one quick question. Is it correct that in
1971 we were using around 6500 informers for a black ghetto
situation?

MR ADAMS: I'm not sure if that's the year. We did have a year
where we had a number like that of around 6000 and that was
the time when the cities were being burned. Detroit, Washington,
areas like this, we were given a mandate to know what the
situation is, where is violence going to break out next. They
weren't informants like an individual that is penetrating an
organization. They were listening posts in the community that
would help tell us that we have another group here that is

getting ready to start another fire fight or something.

| QUESTION: +... Without going into that subject further of course we

have had considerable evidence this morning where no attempt
was made to prevent crime when you had information that it
was going to occur. I am sure there were instances where

you have.

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

We disseminated every single item which he reported to us.

To a police department which you knew was an accomplice to
the crime.

Not necessarily knew.

Your informant told you that, hadn't he?

The informant is on one level. We have other informants
and we have other information.

You were aware that he had worked with certain members of
the Birmingham Police in order...

That's right. He furnished many other instances also.

So you really weren't doing a whole lot to prevent that
incident by telling the people who were already a part of it.

We were doing everything we could lawfully do at the
time and finally the situation was corrected when the Department
agreeing that we had no further jurisdiction, sent the U.S.
Marshals down to perform certain law enforcement functions.

..-This brings up the point as to what kind of control
you can exercise over this kind of informant and to this
kind of organization and to what extent an effort is made to
prevent these informants from engaging in the kind of thing
that you were supposedly trying to prevent.

A good example of this was Mr. Rowe who became active in
an Action Group and we told him to get out or we were no longer
using him as an informant in spite of the information he had
furnished in the past. We have cases, Senator where we have had

But you also told him to participate in violent activities

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

| QUESTION:

We did not tell him to participate in violent activities.

That's what he said.

I know that's what he says, but that's what lawsuits
are all about is that there are two sides to issues and our
Agent handlers have advised us, and I believe have advised your
staff members, that at no ‘time did they advise him to engage
in violence.

Just to do what was necessary to get the information.

I do not think they made any such statement to him
along that line either and we have informants who have gotten
involved in the violation of a law and we have immediately
converted their status from an informant to the subject and
have prosecuted I would say off hand, I can think of around
20 informants that we have prosecuted for violating the laws
once it came to our attention and even to show you our policy
of disseminating information on violence in this case during
the review of the matter the Agents have told me that they
found one case where an Agent had been working 24 hours a
day and he was a little late in disseminating the information
to the police department. No violence occurred but it showed
up in a file review and he was censured for his delay in :
properly notifying local authorities. So we not only
have a policy, I feel that we do follow reasonable safeguards
in order to carry it out, including periodic review of all
informant files.

Mr. Rowe's statement is substantiated to some extent with

an acknowledgment by the Agent in Charge that if he were going

MR. ADAMS:

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

MR. ADAMS:

to be a Klansman and he happened to be with someone and they
decided to do something, he couldn't be an angel. These are
words of the Agent. And be a good informant. He wouldn't
take the lead but the implication is that he would have

to go along or would have to be involved if he was going

to maintain his liability as a ---

There is no question that an informant at times will
have to be present during demonstrations, riots, fistfights
that take place but I believe his statement was to the
effect that, and I was sitting in the back of the room and I do
not recall it exactly, but that some of them were beat with
chains and I did not hear whether he said he beat someone with
a chain or not but I rather doubt that he did, because it is
one thing being present, it is another thing taking an
active part in a criminal action.

It's true. He was close enought to get his throat cut
apparently.

How does the collection of information about an
individual's personal life, social, sex life and becoming
involved in that sex life or social life is a requirement for
law enforcement or crime prevention.

Our Agent handlers have advised us on Mr. Rowe that
they gave him no such instruction, they had no such knowledge
concerning it and I can't see where it would be of any

value whatsoever.

‘senator Tower. What criteria do you ne in the selection
of informants?

Mr. Wannall. Well, the criteria vary with the needs. In
our cases relating to extremist matters, surely in, order to get
an informant who can meld into a group which is engaged in a
criminal type activity, you're going to have a different set
of eriteria, If you're talking about our internal security
matters, I think we set rather high standards. We do require
that a preliminary inquiry be conducted which would consist
principally of checks of our headquarters indices, our field
office indices, checks with other informants who are operating
in the same area, and in various established sources such as
local police departments.

Following this, if it appears that the person is the type
who has credibility, can be depended upon to be reliable, we
would interview the individual in order to make a determination
as to whether or not he will be willing to assist the FBI
in discharging its Hezponsine tities in. that. field.

Following that, assuming that the. answer is positive, we
would conduct a rather in depth investigation for the purpose
of. further attempting to establish credibility and. reliability.

Senator. Tower. .How. does the. Bureau. distinguish between
the. use of informants for law enforcement as opposed to
intelligence. collection?

Is the guidance different, or is it the same, or what?

Mr. Wannall. Well, Mr. Adams can probably best address
the use of informants on criminal matters since he is over
the operational division on that.

Mr. Adams. You do have somewhat of a difference in the fac
that a criminal informant in a law enforcement ‘function, you
are trying to develop evidence which will be admissible in
court for prosecution, whereas with intelligence, the informant
alone, your purpose could either be prosecution or it could be
just for purposes of pure intelligence.

The difficulty in both is retaining the confidentiality
of the individual and protecting the individual, and trying to,
through ibe of the informant, obtain evidence which could be
used independently of the testimony of the informant so that
he can continue operating as a criminal informant.

Senator Tower. Are these informants ever authorized to
function as provocateurs?

Mr. Adams. No, sir, they're not. We have strict regula-
tions against using informants as provocateurs. This gets
into that delicate area of entrapment which has been addressed
by the courts on many occasions and has been concluded by the
courts that providing an individual has a willingness to engage
in an activity, the government has the right to provide him the |

especially the Supreme Court in the Newark County Case, that ~-
the very difficulty of penetrating an ongoing operation, that
an informant himself can engage in criminal activity, but
because there is lacking this criminal intent to violate a
law, we stay atte from that. Our regulatiors fall short of that.

If we have a situation where we felt that an informant
has to become involved in some activity in order to protect
or conceal his use as an informant, we go right to the United -
States Attorney or to the Attorney General to try to make sure
we are not stepping out of bounds insofar as the use of our
informants.

Senator Tower. But you do use these informants and do
instruct them to spread dissension among certain groups that
they are informing on, do you not?

Mr. Adams. We did when we had the COINTELPRO programs,
which were discontinued in 1971, and I think the Klan is probably
one of the best examples of a situation where’ the'law was:
in effect at the time. We heard the term States Rights used
much more then than we hear it today. We saw in the Little
Rock situation the President of the United States, in sending
in the troops, pointing out the necessity to use local law
enforcement. We must have local law enforcement, to use the
troops only as a last resort.

And then you have a situation like this where you do try

2 historical problems with the Klan coming along. We had

5 situations where the FBI and the Federal Government was almost
4 || powerless to act. We‘had local law enforcement officers in ;
5 some areas participating in Klan violence. i
6 The instances mentioned by Mr. Rowe, every one of those, : |
7 he saw them from the lowest level of the informant. He didn't i
8 see what action was taken with that information, as he pointed
“9 out in his testimony. Our files show that this information was

11 | also knew that in certain instances the information, upon being

12.) received, was not being acted upon. We also disseminated

Senator Tower. None of these cases, then, there was
adequate evidence of conspiracy to give you jurisdiction to
act?

Mr. Adams. The Departmental His at that time, and still
require Departmental approval where you have a conspiracy.
Under 241, it takes two or more persons acting together. you
can have a mob scene, and you can have blacks and whites
belting each other, but unless you can show that those that
initiated the action acted in concert in a conspiracy, you havel.
no violation.

Congress recognized this, and-it wasn't until 1968
that they came along and added Section 245 to the civil rights
statute, which added punitive measures against an individual
that didn't have to be a conspiracy. But this was a problem
that the whole country was grappling with: the President of
the United States, Attorney General. We were ina situation
where we had rank lawlessness taking place, as you know from
a memorandum we sent you that we sent to the Attorney General.
The de omettenenes we were able to obtain in preventing
violence, and in neutralizing the Klan -- and that was one
of the reasons.

Veterans Against the War?

Was there a legitimate law enforcement purpose, or was the
intent to halter political expression?

Mr. Adams, We had information on the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War that indicated that there were -subversive
groups involved. They were going to North Vietnam and meeting
with the Communist forces. They were going to Paris, attending
meetings paid for and sponsored by the Communist Party, the
International Communist Party. We feel that we.had a very valid
basis to direct our attention to the VVAW.

; It started out, of course, with Gus Hall in 1967, who was
head of the Communist Party, USA, and the comments he made,

and what it finally boiled down to was a situation where it
split off into the Revolutionary Union, which was a Maost
group, and the hard-line Communist group, and at that point
factionalism developed in many of the chapters, and they closed|
those chapters because there was no longer any intent to follow
the national organization.

But we had a valid basis for investigating it, and we
investigated chapters to determine if there was affiliation
and subservience to the national office.

Senator Tower. Mr. ‘art?

Senator Hart of Michigan. But in the process of chasing
after the Veterans Against the War, you got a ot of intornatioh

Mr, Adams. I agree, Senator

Senator Hart of Michigan. Why don't you try to shut that
stuff off by simply telling the agent, or your informant?

Mr, Adams, Here is the problem that you have with that.
When you're looking at an organization, do you report only the
violent statements made by the group or do you also show that
you may have one or two violent individuals, but you have
some of these church groups that were mentioned, and others,
that the whole intent of the group is not in violation of the
statutes, You have to report the good, the favorable along
with the unfavorable, and this is a problem. We wind up with
information in our files. We are accused of being vacuum
cleaners, and you are a vacuum cleaner.’ If you want to know the
real purpose of an organization, do you only report the
violent statements made and the fact that it is by.a small
minority, or do you also-show the broad base of the organization
and what it really is?

And within that is where we have to have the guidelines

we recognize that we do wind up with too much information in
our files.

Senator Hart of Michigan, But in that vacuuming process,
you are feeding into Departmental files the names of people

who are, who have been engaged in basic First Amendment

exercises, and this is what hangs some of us up.

Mr. Adams. It hangs me up. But in the same files I
imagine every one of you has been interviewed by the FBI, eithey
asking you about the qualifications of some other Senator
being considered for a Presidential appointment, being inter-
viewed concerning some friend’ who is applying for a job.

Were you embarrassed to have that in the files of the
FBI?

Now, someone can say, as reported at our last session, tha
this is an indication, the mere fact that we have a a in our
files has an.onerous impression, a chilling effect. I agree.
It can have, if someone wants to distort what we have in our
files, but if they recognize that we interviewed you because
of considering: a man for the Supreme Court of the United

States, and that isn't distorted or improperly used, I don't

‘see. where any harm is served by having that in our files.

Senator Hart of Michigan. this is what should require
us to rethink this whole business.

Mr. Adams. Absolutely.

And this is what I hope the guidelines committees as well.
as the Congressional input ate going to address themselves to.

Senator Hart of Michigan. We've talked about a wide tone!
of groups which the Bureau can and has had informant Laneehishahae |
and report on. Your manual, the Bureau manual's ‘definition
of when an extremist or security investigation-may be under-
taken refers to groups whose activity either involves Violation
of certain specified laws, or which may result in the violation
of such law, and when such an investigation is opened, then
informants may be used.

Another guideline says that domestic intelligence
investigations now must be predicated on criminal violations.
The agent need only cite a statute suggesting an investigation

relevant to a potential violation. Even now, with an improved,

| upgraded effort to avoid some of these problems, we are back

again in a world of possible violations or activities which
may result in illegal acts.

Now, any constitutionally protected exercise of the
right to demonstrate, to assemble, to protest, to petition,
conceivably may result in viclonce or disruption of a local
town meeting, when a controversial social issue might result

in disruption, It might be by hecklers rather than those holdin

the meeting.
Does this mean that the Bureau should investigate all

groups organizing or participating in such a meeting because

“they may result in violence, disruption?

Mr. Adams. No, sir.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Isn't that how you justify
spying on almost every aspect of the peace movement?

Mr. Adams. No, Sir. When we monitor demonstrations, we :
monitor demonstrations where we have an indication that the
demonstration itself is sponsored by a group that we have an
investigative interest in, a valid investigative interest in,
or where members of one of these groups are participating where}
there is a potential that they might change the peaceful
nature of the demonstration.

But this is our closest question of trying to draw
guidelines to avoid getting into an area of infringing on the
First Amendment rights of people, yet at the same time being
aware of groups such as we have had in greater numbers in the
past than we do at the present time, But we have had periods
where the demonstrations have been rather severe, and the
courts have said that the FBI has‘a right, and indeed a duty,
to keep itself informed with respect to the possible commission
of crime. It is not obliged to wear blinders until it may be
too late for prevention.

And that's a good statement if applied in a clearcut

Senator Hart of Michigan. Let's assume that the rule
for opening an investigation on a group is narrowly drawn.
Bureau manual states that ‘informants investigating a subver:
organization should not only report on what that group is
doing but should look at and report on activities in which’
the group is participating.

| There is a Section 87B3 dealing with reporting on
connections with other groups. That section says that the
field office shall "determine and report on any significant
connection or cooperation with non-subversive groups." Any
significant connection or cooperation with non-subversive
groups. ,
Now let's look at this in practice. In the spring of

1969 there was a rather heated national debate over the

4

The

sive

installation of the anti-ballistic missile system. Some of us

remember that. An FBI informant and two FBI confidential

sources reported on the plan's participants and activities
of the Washington Area Citizens Coalition Against the ABM,
particularly in open public debate in’a high school auditor
which included speakers from the Defense Department for the
ABM and a scientist and defense analyst against the ABM.
The informants reported on the planning for the meeti
the distribution of materials to churches and schools,
participation by local clergy, plans to seek resolution on

ABM from nearby town councils. There was also informat’

plans for a subsequent town meeting in Washington with the
names of local political leaders who would attend.

Now the information, the informant information came as
part of an investigation of an allegedly subversive group
participating in that coalition. Yet the information dealt
with all aspects and all participants. The reports on the
plans for the meeting ana on the meeting itself were disseminatd
to the State Department, to military intelligence, and to the
White House.

How do we get into all of that?

Mr. Adams. Well ~~

Senator Hart of Michigan. Or if you were to rerun it,

Mr, Adams. Well, not in 1975, compared to what 1969
was. The problem we had at the time was where we had an
informant who had reported that this group, this meeting was
going to take place and it was going to bethe Daily World,
which was the east coast communist newspaper that made comments |
about it. They formed an organizational Redeanad We took

a quick look at it. The case apparently was opened in May .28,

1969 and closed June 5 saying there was no problem with this
organization.

Now the problem we get into is if we take a quick look
and get out, fine. We've had cases, though, where we have

stayed in too long. When you're dealing with security ** 38 14ik

Soviet espionage where they can put one’ person in this country

and they supported him with total resources of the Soviet

Union, false identification, all the money he needs, comnuni-

cations networks, satellite assistance, and everything, and
you're working with a paucity of information.
The same problem exists to a certain extent in domestic

security. You don't have a lot of black and white situations.

_S0 someone reports something to you which you feel, you take

a quick look at and there's nothing to it, and I think that's
what they did.

Senator Hart of Michigan. You said that was '69. Let
me pring you up to date, closer. to current, a current place
on the calendar,

This one is the fall of last year, 1975. President
Ford announced his new program with respect to amnesty, as
he described it, for draft resistors. Following that there
were several national conferences involving all the groups
and individuals interested in unconditional amnesty.

Now parenthetically, while unconditional amnesty is
not against -~ while unconditional amnesty is not yet the law,
we agreed that advocating it is not against the law either.

Mr, Adams, That's right.

plans for the meeting and apparently attended and reported on

the conference. The Bureau's own reports described the

participants as having represented diverse’ perspectives on

NW 54965 DociId

the issue of amnesty, including civil liberties and human
rights groups, 6.1. rights spokesmen, parents of men killed
in Vietnam, wives of ex-patriates in Canada, experts on draft
counselling, religious groups interested in peace issues,

delegates from student organizations, and aides of House and

| Senate members, drafting legislation on amnesty.

The informant apparently was attending in his role as
a member of a group under investigation as allegedly subversive
and it described the topics of the workshop.

Ironically, the Bureau office report before them noted
that in view of the location of the conference at a theological
seminary, the FBI would use restraint and limit its coverage at
to informant reports.

Now this isn't five or ten years ago. ‘This is last
fall. And this is‘a conference of people who have the point
of view that I share, that the soaner we have unconditional
amnesty, the better for the soul of the country.

Now what reason is it for a vacuum cleaner approach on

}a thing like that? Don't these instances illustrate how broad

informant intelligence really is, that would cause these groups

Is this what we want? -

Hr. Adams. I'll let Mr. Wannall address himself to this.
He is particular knowledgeable as to this operation.

Mr. Wannall. Senator Hart, that was a case that was
opened on November 14 and closed November 20, and the infoxmatidn
which caused us to be interested in it were really.two particuldr
items. One was that a member of the steoring committee there)
was a three man steering committee, and oné of those members
of the national conference was in fact a national officer
of the VVAW in whom we haa suggested before we did. have a
legitimate investigative interest.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, I would almost say so whht
at that point. ;

Mr. Wannall. The second report we had was that the
VVAW would actively participate in an attempt to pack the
conference to take it over. And the third report we had --

Senator Hart of Michigan. And incidentally, all of the
information that your Buffalo informant had given you with
respect to the goals and aims of the VVAW gave you 7 list of
goals which were completely within Constitutionally protected

objectives. There wasn't a single item out of that VVAW that

jeopardizes the security of this country at all.
Mr. Wannall. Well, of-course, we did not rely entirely

on the Buffalo infoxmant, but even ‘there we did recei*

from that informant information which I considered to be
significant.

The Buffalo chapter of the VVAW was the regional office
covering New York and northern New Jersey: It was one ‘of the
five most active VVAN chapters’ in the country and ata
national conference, or at the regional conference, this
informant reported information hack to us that an attendee
ars the conference announced that he had run guns into Cuba
prior to the Castro take-over. He himsel£ said that he during
the Cuban crisis had been under 24 hour suveillance. There
was also discussion at the conference of subjugating the
VVAW to the revolutionary union. There were some individuals
in the chapter or the regional conference who were not in

agreement with us, but Mr. Adams has addressed himself to the

, interest of the revolutionary union.

So all of the information that we had on the vvaw did
not come from that source but even that particular source did
give us information which we considered to be of some
significance in our appraisal’ of the need for continuing the
investigation of that particular chapter of the yVAW.

Senator Hart of Michigan. _ But does it give you the
right or does it create the need to go to a conference, even
if it is a conference that might be taken over by the VVAW
when the subject matter is how and by what means shall we

seek to achieve unconditional’ amnesty? What threat?

Mr, Wannall., Our interest, of course, was the VA
influence on a particular meeting, if you ever happened to be
holding a meeting, ox whatever subject it was.

Senator Mart of Michigan, What if it was a meeting to

ke more effective the food stamp system in this
country? :

Me. Wannal. Well, of course there haa been some
organizations. ;

Senator iart of Michigan. Would the same, logic follow?

Mr. Wannail. I think that if we found that if the
Communist Party USA was going ‘to take over the meeting and
use it asa front for its own purposes, there would be a logic
in doing that. You have a whole scope here and it's a matter
of where you, do and where you don't, and hopefully, as we've
said before, we will have’ some guidance, not only from this
committee but from the guidelines that are being developed.
But within the rationale of what we're doing today, I was
explaining to you our interest not in going to this thing and
not gathering everything there was about it.

In fact, only one individual attended and reported to us,
and that was the person who had, who was not developed for
this reason; an informant who had been reporting on other
matters for some period of time.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Well, my time has expired
but even this brief exchange, I think, indicates that if we
really want to control the dangers to our society of using
informants to gather domestic political intelligence, we have
to restrict sharply domestic intelligence investigations. And
that gets us into what I would like to raise with you when

my turn comes around again, and that's the use of warrants,

obliging the Bureau to obtain a warrant before’a full-fledged

informant can be directed by the Bureau against a group or
individuals.

I know you have objections to that and I would like to
review that: with you.

Senator Mondale, pursue that question.

Senator Hart of Michigan. I am talking now about an
obligation to obtain a warrant before you turn loose a full-
fledged informant. I'm not talking about tipsters that run
into you or you run into, or who walk in as information sources
The Bureau has raised some objections in this memorandum to the
Committee. The Bureau argues that such a warrant requirement
might be unconstitutional because it would violate the First
Amendment rights of FBI informants to communicate with their
government.

Now that's a concern for First Amendmént rights that

ought to - hearten all the civil libertarians,

But why would that vary, why would a warrant requirement
raise a serious constitutional question?

Mr. Adams. Well, for one thing it's the practicability
of it or the impacticability of‘getting a warrant which:
ordinarily involves probable cause to show that a crime has
been or is about to be committed.

Pane intelligence field we are aoe dealing necessarily
with an imminent criminal action. We're dealing with activitied
such as with the Socialist Workers Party, which we have
discussed before, where they say publicly we're not to engage
‘in any violent activity today, but we guarantee you we still
subscribe to the tenets of communism and that when the time
is ripe, we're going to rise up and help overthrow the United
States,

Well, now, you can't show probable cause if they're about
to do it because they're telling you they're nol, going to do it
and you know they're not going to do it at this particular
moment.

It's just the mixture somewhat of trying to mix ina
criminal procedure with an intelligence gathering function, and
we can't find any practical way of doing it. We have a particular
organization. We may have an informant that not only belongs
to the Communist Party, but belongs to several other fy
and as part of his function he may be sent out by the communist

Party to try to infiltrate one of these clean organizations.

We don't have probable cause for him to target against

It's just from our standpoint the possibility of informants,
the Supreme Court has held ‘that informants per se do not
violate the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendments. They have
recognized the necessity. ‘that the government has to have
individuals who will assist them in carrying out their
governmental duties.

Senator Hart of ‘Michigan. “I'm not sure ‘I've heard anything
yet in response to the constitutional question, the very
practical question that you addressed.

Quickly, you are right that the court has said that the
use of the informant per se is not a violation of constitutiona
rights of the subject under investigation. But Congress
can prescribe some safeguards, some rules and some standards,

Senator Tower. Senator Schweiker.

Senator Schweiker. Thank you very much,

Mr. Wannall, what's the difference between a potential
security informant and a security informant? ,

Mx. Wannall. I mentioned earlier, Senator Schweiker,

‘that in developing an informant we do a preliminary check on

him before talking with him and then we do a further in-depth
background check.

A potential security informant is someone who is under
consideration before he is approved by headquarters for use as’

an informant. He is someone who is under current consideration.

On some occasions that person will have been developed to a
point where he is in fact furnishing information and we oral
engaged in checking upon his reliability.

In some piueuneae he may be paid. for information furnishe
but it has not gotten to'the point yet where we have satisfied
ourselves that he meets all of our criteria. When he does,
the field must submit its recommendations to headquarters, and
headquarters will pass upon whether that individual is an

Senator Schweiker. So it's really the first step of
being an informant, I guess.

Mr. Wannall. It is a preliminary step, one of .the
preliminary steps.

Senator Schweiker, In the Rowe case, in:the Rowe
testimony that we just heard, what was the rationale again
for not intervening when violence was known?

I know we asked you several times but I'm still having
trouble understanding what the rationale, Mr. Wannall, was
in not intervening in the Rowe situation when violence was
known.

Mr. Wannall. Senator Schveiker, Mr. Adams did address
himself to that. If you have no objection, I'll ask him to
answer that. ;

problem today, we are an investigative agency. We do not

have police powers like the United States marshalls do.

About 1795, I guess, or some period like that, marshalls have
had the authority that almost borders on what a sheriff,has.

We are the investigative agency of the Department of Justice
and during these times the Department of Justice had us maintaiy
the role of an investigative agency. We were to ‘report on ;
activities to furnish the information to ‘the ‘local police, ©

who had an obligation to, act. We furnished it to the paper emer
of Justice.

In those areas where the local police did not act, it
resulted finally in the Attorney General sending 500 United
States marshalls down to guarantee the safety of people who
were trying to march in protest of their civil rights.

This was an extraordinary measure because it came at a

time of civil righs versus federal rights, and yet there was

_a breakdown in law enforcement in certain areas of the country.

This doesn't mean to indict all law enforcement agencies

.in itself at the time either because many of them did act

upon the information that was furnished to them, But we
have no authority to make an arrest on the spot because we
would not have had evidence that there was a-conspiracy
available. We can do absolutely nothing in that regard.

In Little Rock, the decision was made, for instance, that

not the FBI, even though we developed the violations.
And over the years, as “you know, at the time there were many

questions raised. Why doesn't the FBI stop this? Why don't

Well, we took the other route and effectively destroyed
the Klan as far as committing acts of violence, and of course
we exceeded statutory guidelines in that area.

Senator Schweiker, What would be wrong, just following
up your point there, Mr,.Adams, with setting up a program
sincé it's obvious to me that a lot of informers are going to
have pre-knowledge of.violence of using U.S. marshalls on some
kind of a long-range basis to prevent violence?

Mr. Adams, We do. We have them in Boston in connection
with the busing incident. We are investigating the violations
under the ‘Civil: Rights Act. But the marshalls are in Boston,
they are in Louisville, I believe at the same time, and this
is the approach, that the Federal government finally recognized
was the solution to the problem where you had to have added
Federal import. :

Senator Schweiker. But instead of waiting until it
gets to a Boston state, which is obviously a pretty “advanced
confrontation, shouldn't we have plese oaeada a coordinated program}

gets toa Boston state?

I realize it's a departture from the past. I'm not
saying it isn't. But it seems. to a we need a better remedy
than we have.

Mr. Adams. Well, penererrs we ‘re at a time where
conditions have subsidéd in the country, even from the '60s
and the '70s and periods -- or '50s and '60s. We report to the
Department of Justice on potential troublespots around the
country as we learn of them so that the Department will be
aware of them. The planning for’Boston, for instance, took
place a year in advance with state officials, city officials,
the Department of Justice and the FBI sitting down together
saying, how are we going to protect the situation in Boston?

I think we've learned a lot from the days back in ‘the
early '60s. But the government had no mechanics which protected
people at that time,

Senator Schweiker. I'd like to go, if I may, to the
Robert Hardy case. I know he is not a witness but he
was a witness before the House. But since this affects my
Seatel I'd like to ask Mr. Wannall., Mr. Hardy, of course, was
the FBI informer who ultimately led and planned and organized
a raid on the Camden draft hoard. aaa according to Mr. Haray ‘s
testimony before our Committee, he sz.i that in advance of the

raid someone in the Department had even acknowledged the fact

that they had all the information they needed to clamp down
on the conspiracy and could arrest people at that point in time,

and yet no arrests Part made. j

Why, Mr. Wannall, was this true?

Mr. Wannall. Well, I can answer that based only on ‘the
material that I have reviewed, Senator Schweiker. It was not
a case handled in my division but I think I can answer your
question.

There was, in fact, a representative of the Department
of Justice on the spot counselling and advising continuously
as that case progressed as to what soint the. arrest should be
made and we were being guided by ‘those to our mentors, the
ones who are responsible for making decisions of that sort..

So I. think that Mr. Hardy's statement to the effect that
there was someone in the Department there is perfectly true.

Senator Schweiker, That responsibility rests with wlio
under your procedures?

Mr. Wannall. We investigate decisions on making arrests,
when they should be made, and decisions with regard to
prosecutions are made either by the United states attorneys
lox by Federals in the Department.

Mr. Adams. At this time that particular case did have

someone in the commission of the crime as further proof,
rather than relying on. one informant and some circumstantial
evidence to prove the violation.

Senator Schweiker. Well,.in this case, though, they
even had a dry run. - They could have arrested them on the
dry run.

That's getting pretty close to conspiracy, it seems to
me. They had a dry run and they could have arrested them on
the dry run. :

I'd like to know why they didn't arrest them on the dry
run. Who was this Departinent of Justice official who made
that decision?

Mr. Adams. Guy Goodwin was the Department official.

Senator Schweiker, Next I'd like to ask back in 1965,
during the height of the effort to destroy the Klan, as you
put it a few moments ago, I believe the FBI has released
figures that we had ‘something like 2,000 informers of some
kind or another infiltrating the’ Klan out of roughly 10,000
estimated membership.

I believe these are either FBI figures or estimates.
That would mean that one out of every five members of the Klan
at that point was an informant paid by the government.

And I believe the figure goes ony indicate that 70
percent of the new members of ‘the Kla:. that year were FBI

informants.

tail-wagging the : dog.

For example, today we supposedly have only 1594. total ve
informants for both domestic informants and potential informants ,.
and that here we had 2,000 just in the Klan alone.

Mr. Adams, Well, this number 2,000 aid include all

think the figures we tried to reconstruct as to the actual
number of Klan informants in relation to Klan members was aroun
6 percent, I think, after we had read some of the- testimony.
Now the problem we had on the Klan is the Klan had a
group called the Action Group. “This was the group that you
remember from Mr. Rowe's testimony, that he was left af-
ter the meeting. He attended the open meetings and heard
all of the hurrahs and this type of thing from information,
but he never knew what was going on because each one had an
action group that went out and considered themselves in the
missionary field.
Theirs was the violence.

Senator Schweiker. My time is expired. I just have
one quick question..

Is it correct that in 1971 we're using around 6500
informers for black ghetto situations?

Mr. Adams. I'm not sure if that's. the year. We did
‘have one year where we had a number like that which probably
had been around 6000, and that was the time when the cities
were being burned, Detroit, ‘Washington, areas like this.-. We.
were given a mandate to know what the situation is, where is
violence going to break out, what next?

They weren't informants like an individual penetrating
an organization, They were listening posts in the community
that would help tell us that we have a group here that's getting
ready to start another fire-fight-or something,

Senator Tower. At this point, there are ‘three more
Senators remaining for questioning. If we can try to get
everything in-in the first round, we will not have a ‘second
round and I think we can ‘finish around 1:00, and we can.go

organization of its kind-in the world. And when the PBI acts
‘in the field of political ideas, it has bungled its job, it
has interfered with the civil liberties, and finally, in the
ast month or two, through its public disclosures, heaped
shame upon itself and really led toward an undermining of

the crucial public confidence in'an essential: law enforcement
agency of this country.

In a real sense, history has repeated itself because it

was precisely that problem that led to the creation of the FBI
in 1924,

In World War I, the Bureau of Investigation strayed from
its law enforcement functions and became an arbiter and
protector of political ideas. “and through the interference
of civil liberties and Palmer Raids and the rest, the public
became so Pant that later through Mr. pibeted Stone and~-
Mr. Hoover, the FBI was created. And the first statement
by Mr. Stone was that never again will this Justice Department
get involved in political ideas.

Martin Luther King, with anti-war resistors, with -- we even
had testimony this morning of meetings with the Couricil of
Churches. Secretly we are investigating this vague, ill-defined,

don't have probable cause to investigate anyone, but you can
direct an intelligence operation against the German-American
Bund, the same thing we did after Congress said -~

Senator Mondale. Couldn't you get a warrant for that?
Why did you object to ‘going to court ‘for authority for that? -

Mr, Adams. Because we don't have probable cause to
go against an individual and the law doesn't provide for
probable cause to investigate an organization.

There were activities which did take place, like one time
they outlined the Communist Party -- ,

Senator Mondale. What I don't understand is why it
“wouldn't be better for the FBI for us to define authority
that you could use in the kind of Bonn situation where under
court authority you ‘can investigate where there is probable
cause or reasonable cause to suspect sabotage and the rest.

Wouldn't that make a lot more sense than, just making these

decisions on your own?

Mx. Adams. We have expressed cemplete concurrence in
that. We feel that we're going to gre stheat to death in the :
next 100 years, you're damned if you ‘o, and damned if you

don't if we don't have a delineation of our responsibility

in this area. But I won't agree with you, Senator, that we
thave bungled the intelligence operations in the United States.
I agree with you that we have made some mistakes. Mr. Kelley
has set a pattern of being as forthright as any Director of the
FBI in acknowledging mistakes that. had been made, but I think
that as you said, and I believe Senator Tower said, and
Senator Church, that we have to watch these hearings because
of the necessity that we must concentrate on these areas of
abuse. We must not lose sight of the

overall law enforcement and intelligence community, and I
still feel that. this is the freest country in the world,

I've travelled much, as I'm sure you have, and I know we have
made some mistakes, but I feel that the people in the United
States are less chilled by the mistakes we have made than they
are’ by the fact that there are 20,000 murders a year in the
United States and they can't walk out of their houses at night
and feel safe.

“Senator Mondale, That's correct, and isn't that an
argument then, Mr. Adams, for strengthening our powers to go
after those who commit crimes rather than strengthening or
continuing a policy which we now see undermines ‘the public
confidence you need to do your ‘job.

Mr. Adams. Absolutely. The mistakes we have made are
what have brought ah this Snbarrasenend to us. ef

I'm not blaming the Committee. I'm saying we made some

mistakes and in doing so this is what has hurt the FBI. But
at the same time I don't feel that a balanced picture comes
out, as you have said yourselves, because of the necessity
of zercing in ae abuses .

I think that we have done one tremendous job. I think
the accoiuplishments “in the Klan was the finest hour of the

some mistakes. But I just don't agree with bungling.

Senator Mondale. I don't want to argue over terms, but
I think I sense an agreement that the FBI has gotten into troub.
over it in the political idea trouble, and that that's where we
need to have new legal standards.

Mr. Adams. Yes, t agreé with that.

Senator Tower. Senator Huddleston.

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr, Adams, these two instances we have studied at: some
length seems to have been an * Snelination on the part of
the Bureau to establish, a notion about an individual or a group
which seems to be very hard to ever change or dislodge. In
the case of Dr. King, where the supposition was that he was)
being influenced by Communist individuals, extensive investi-
gation was made, surveillance, reports came back indicating tha
this in fact was untrue, and directions continued to go out
to intensify the investigation. There never seemed to be a
willingness on the part of the Bureau to accept its own facts.

Ms. Cook testified this morning that something similar
to that happened with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, thal
every piece of information that she supplied to the Bureau
seemed to indicate that the Bureau was. not correct in its
assumption that this organization planned to commit violence,

or that it was being manipulated, and yet you seemed to insist

that this investigation go on, and +} information was used

against the individuals.

Senator Huddleston. Now, the Committee has received
documents which indicated that in one situation the FBI assiste
an informant who had been established in a white hate group
to establish a rival white hate group, and that the Bureau paid
his expenses in setting up this rival organization.

Now, does. this not put the Bureau in a position of ‘being
responsible for what actions the rival white hate group might
have undertaken? os

Mr. Adams. I'd like to see if one of the other gentlemen
knows that specific case, Heats I don't think we set up a

This is Joe Deegan. : :

was in compliance with our regulations. His breaking off,

Senator Huddleston, The new organization that he forméd,

Mr, Deegan. No, it did not, ‘and it did not last that

Senator Huddleston. There's also evidence of an FBI
informant in the Black Panther Party who haa a position of - +
responsibility within the Party with the knowledge of his
“FBI contact of supplying members with weapons and instructing
them in how to use those weapons. Presumably ‘this was in the

control you exercised over this kind of informant in this kind
of an. organization and to, what ‘extent an effort is made to

to the subject, and have prosecuted I would’ say, offhand, I

can think of around 20 informants that we have prosecuted for-

-violating the laws, once it-came to our attention, and even

to show you our policy of disseminating information on violence
in-this case, during the review of the matter, the agents told
me that they found one case where their agent had been working

24 hours a day, and he was a little late in disseminating the

information to the police department. No violence.occurred,, |

but it showed up in a file review, and he was censured for
his delay in properly notifying local authorities.

So we not only have a policy, I feel that we do follow
reasonable safeguards.in order to carry it out, including perio
review of all informant. files.

Senator Huddleston, Well, Mr. Rowe's statement is
substantiated to some extent with the acknowledgement by the
agent in charge that if you're going to be a Klansman and you

happen to be with someone and they decide to.do something, that

| he couldn't be an angel. These were the words of the agent,,.

and be a good informant. -He wouldn't take the lead; but the
implication is that he would have to go along and would have
to be involved if he was going. to maintain his credibility.

times. will have to be: present. during demonstrations, riots,

Senator Huddleston. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Senator Tower. Senator Mathias.

“Senator Mathias. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to come back very briefly to the Fourth
‘Amendment considerations in connection with the use of informants
and in posing these questions we're not thinking of the one
time volunteer who walks in to an FBI office and says I have
a story I want to tell you and that's the only time that you
may see him. I'm thinking of the kind of situations in which
there is a more extended relationship which could be of varying
degrees. It might be in one case that the same individual
will have some usefulness in a number of situations. But when

the FBI orders a regular agent to engage in a search, the first.
. 7 i

test is a judicial warrant, and what I would like’ to explore
with you is the difference between a one time search which
requires a warrant, and which you get when you make that
search, and a continuous search which uses an informant, or
the case of a continuous search which uses a regular undercover
agent, someone who is totally under your control, and is ina
slightly different category than an informant.

Mr. Adams. Well, we get there into the fact that the

Supreme Court has still held that the use of informants does’

not invade any of these constitutionally protected areas, ,and

iff a person wants to tell an informant something that isn't
protected by the Supreme Court.

An actual search for legal evidence, that is a protected
item, but ‘information and the use of informants have been
conSistently held as not posing any constitutional problems.

Senator Mathias. I would agree, if you're talking about
the fellow who walks in off the street, as I said earlier, :
but is it true that under existing eae ee informants are
given background checks?

Mr. Adams. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. And they are subject to a testing period

ship continues, ‘they are rather closely controlled by the

Senator Mathias. So in effect they can come in a very
practical way agents themselves to the FBI.

Mr. Adams. They can do nothing --

Senator Mathias. Certainly agents in the common law use
of the word.

agent himself cannot do, and if the agent can work himself into

Mr, Adams, The main difficulty is the particularity
which has to be shown in obtaining a search warrant. You
have to go after particular evidence. You have to specify
what you're going after, and an informant operates in an
area that you just cannot specify. He doesn't know what's
going, to be discussed at ‘that meeting. It may be a plot to
blow up the Capitol again or it may be a plot to blow up the
State Department building. . ;

Senator Mathias. If it were a criminal investigation,
you would have Little difficulty with probable cause, wouldn't
you?

Mr. Adams. We would have difficulty in a warrant to
use sonéolia as.an informant in that area because the same
difficulty of particularity exists. We can't specify.

Senator Mathias. I understand the problem because it's
very similar to Une that we discussed earlier in connection
say wiretaps on a national security problem.

Mr. Adams, That's it, and there we face the problem of
where the Soviet, an individual identified as a Soviet spy
in a friendly country and they tell us he's been a Soviet spy
there and now he's coming to the United States, and if os can't
show nae! a probable cause warrant, if we couldn't show that
he was actually engaging in espionage in the United States,
we couldn't get a wiretap under the probable cause requirements

which have been discussed, If the good fairy didn't drop the

Senator Mathias. And you don't despair of finding that
middle ground?

Major abuses of Congress and get over this hurdle, I think
we're still going to have to recognize that heads of agencies
have to accept the xesponsibility for managing that agency
and we can't just keep pushing every operational problem up
to the top because there just aren't enough hours in the’ day.

Senator Mathias. But the reason that parallel suggests
itself is of course the fact that. the wiretap deals generally :
with one level of information in one Sone: of gathering
information. You hear what you hear from the tap.

Mr, Adams, But you're dealing in a much smaller number
also.

Senator Mathias. Smaller number, but that's all .the

More reason. When an informant goes in, he has all of his

senses. He's gathering all of the information a human being
can acquire from a situation and has access to more information
than the average wiretap.

: And it would seem to me that for that reason a.parallel
process might be useful ‘and in order.

: “vrs Adams, Mr. Mintz pointed out one other main
distinction . to me which I had overlooked from our prior
discussions, which is the fact that with an informant he is
more in the position of being a concentral monitor in that one
of the two parties to the conversation agrees, such as like
concentral monitoring of telephones and microphones and

anything else versus the wiretap itself where the individual

Do you feel that‘ this ‘would be too restrictive?

we carve all of the problems away, we still have to make sure

that we have the means to gather information which will permit

us to be aware of the identity of individuals and organizations

that are acting to overthrow the government of the United
States. And I think we still have some areas to look hard

It's hete to say. It's been here throughout history *°
and there will always be informants. And the thing we want to
avoid is abuses. like provocateurs, criminal activities, and
to ensure that we have safeguards that will prevent that.

But we do need informants.

Senator Hart of Michigan. Yes. I ask unanimous request
perhaps with a view to giving balance to the record, the

Bureau has put informants, in popular language, our liberal
groups -- I would ask unanimous consent that .be printed in

I welcome the interest which this Committee
has shown in the FBI and most particularly in our
operations in the intelligence and internal security
fields.

I share your high regard for the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United
States. Throughout my 35-year career in law enforcement
you will find the same insistence, as has been expressed
by this Committee, upon programs of law enforcement that -
are themselves fully consistent with law.

I also have strongly supported the concept of
legislative oversight. In fact, at the time my appointment
as Director of the FBI was being considered by the Senate
Judiciary Committee two and one-half years ago, I told
the members of that Committee of my firm belief in
Congressional oversight.

This Committee has completed the most
exhaustive study of our intelligence and security

operations that has ever been undertaken by anyone



e e r"

outside the FBI other than the present Attorney General.
At the outset, we pledged our fullest cooperation and
promised to be as candid and forthright as possible in
responding to your questions and complying with your
requests.

I believe we have lived up to those promises.

The members and staff of this Committee have
had unprecedented access to FBI information.

You have talked to the personnel who conduct
security-type investigations and who are personally involved
in every facet of our day-to-day intelligence operations.

You have attended numerous briefings by FBI
officials who have sought to familiarize the Committee
and its staff with all major areas of our activities
and operations in the national security and intelligence
fields.

In brief, you have had a firsthand examination of
these matters that is unmatched at any time in the history
of the Congress.

As this Committee has stated, these hearings
have, of necessity, focused largely on certain errors
and abuses. I credit this Committee for its forthright
recognition that the hearings do not give a full or

balanced account of the FBI's record of performance.

-2-

NW 54965 DocId:329839503 Page 123


| NW 54965 Docld:32989503 Page 124

It is, perhaps, in the nature of such hearings
to focus on abuses to the exclusion of positive accomplishments
of the organization.

The Counterintelligence Programs which have
received the lion's share of public attention and critical
comment constituted an infinitesimal portion of our over~
all work.

A Justice Department Committee which was formed
last year to conduct a thorough study of the FBI's
Counterintelligence Programs has reported that in the
five basic ones it found 3,247 Counterintelligence proposals
were submitted to FBI Headquarters from 1956 to 1971. Of this
total, 2,370 -- less than three-fourths -~ were approved.

I repeat, the vast majority of those 3,247
proposals were being devised, considered, and many were
rejected, in an era when the FBI was handling an average
of 700,000 investigative matters per year.

Nonetheless, the criticism which has been
expressed regarding the Counterintelligence Programs
is most legitimate and understandable.

The question might well be asked what I had
in mind when I stated last year that for the FBI to have
done less than it did under the circumstances then existing
would have been an abdication of its responsibilities

to the American people.



e e ry

What I said then -- in 1974 -- and what I believe
today, is that the FBI employees involved in these programs
did what they felt was expected of them by the President,
the Attorney General, the Congress, and the people of
the United States.

Bomb explosions rocked public and private
offices and buildings; rioters led by revolutionary
extremists laid siege to military, industrial, and
educational facilities; and killings, maimings, and
other atrocities accompanied such acts of violence
from New England to California.

The victims of these acts were human beings --
men, women, and children. As is the case in time of peril --
whether real or perceived -- they looked to their Government,
their elected and appointed leadership, and to the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies to protect their lives, their
property, and their rights.

There were many calls for action from Members
of Congress and others, but few guidelines were furnished.
The FBI and other law enforcement agencies were besieged
by demands...impatient demands...for immediate action.

FBI employees recognized the danger; felt

they had a responsibility to respond; and, in good faith,

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 125



) e @

initiated actions designed to counter conspiratorial:
efforts of self-proclaimed revolutionary groups, and
to neutralize violent activities.

In the development and execution of these programs,
mistakes of judgment admittedly were made.

Our concern over whatever abuses occurred
in the Counterintelligence Programs -- and there were
some substantial ones -- should not obscure the underlying
purpose of those programs.

We must recognize that situations have occurred
in the past and will arise in the future where the
Government may well be expected to depart from its
traditional role -- in the FBI's case, as an investi-
gative and intelligence-gathering agency -- and take
affirmative steps which are needed to meet an imminent
threat to human life or property.

In short, if we learn a murder or bombing is to
be carried out NOW, can we truly meet our responsibilities
by- investigating only after the crime has occurred, or
should we have the ability to prevent? I refer to those
instances where there is a strong sense of urgency because
of an imminent threat to human life.

Where there exists the potential to penetrate

and disrupt, the Congress must consider the question of

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 126



® e '

whether or not such preventive action should be available
to the FBI.

These matters are currently being addressed
by a task force in the Justice Department, including the
FBI, and I am confident that Departmental guidelines and
controls can be developed in cooperation with pertinent
Committees of Congress to insure that such measures are
used in an entirely responsible manner.

Probably the most important question here
today is what assurances can I give that the errors
and abuses which arose under the Counterintelligence
Programs will not occur again?

First, let me assure the Committee that some
very substantial changes have been made in key areas of the
FBI's methods of operations since I took the oath of
office as Director on July 9, 1973.

Today we place a high premium on openness ~-
openness both within and without the service.

I have instituted a program of open, frank
discussion in the decision-making process which
insures that no future program or major policy decision
will ever be adopted without a full and critical review

of its propriety.

| NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 127



|

| NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 128

Participatory management has become a fact
in the FBI.

I have made it known throughout our Headquarters
and Field Divisions that I welcome all employees, regardless
of position or degree of experience, to contribute their
thoughts and suggestions, and to voice whatever criticisms
or reservations they may have concerning any area of our
operations.

The ultimate decisions in the Bureau are mine,
and I take full responsibility for them. My goal is to
achieve maximum critical analysis among our personnel without
in any manner weakening or undermining our basic command
structure.

The results of this program have been most
beneficial...to me personally...to the FBI's disciplined
performance...and to the morale of our employees.

In addition, since some of the mistakes of the
past were occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities
outside the FBI, we have welcomed Attorney General Edward
Levi's guidance, counsel, and his continuous availability --
in his own words -- "as a ‘lightning rod' to deflect improper
requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General

Levi instructed that I immediately report to him any



requests or practices which, in my judgment, were improper
or which, considering the context of the request, I believed
presented the appearance of impropriety.

I am pleased to report to this Committee as I
have to the Attorney General that during my nearly two
and one-half years as Director under two Presidents and
three Attorneys General, no one has approached me or
made overtures -- directly or otherwise -- to use the
FBI for partisan political or other improper purposes.

I can assure you that I would not for a moment
consider honoring any such request.

: I can assure you, too, in my administration of
the FBI I routinely bring to the attention of the Attorney
General and the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions,
including those which arise in my continuing review of our
operations and practices. These are discussed openly and
candidly in order that the Attorney General can exercise
his responsibilities over the FBI.

I am convinced that the basic structure of the
FBI today is sound, But it would be a mistake to think
that integrity can be assured only through institutional
means.

Integrity is a human quality. It depends upon
the character of the person who occupies the office of

Director and every member of the FBI under him.

NW 54965 DoclId:32989503 Page 129



NW 54965
Wneetaeeeee

I am proud of the 19,000 men and women with
whom it is my honor to serve today. Their dedication,
their professionalism, their standards, and the self-
discipline which they personally demand of themselves
and expect of their associates are the Nation's ultimate
assurance of proper and responsible conduct at all times
by the FBI.

The Congress and the members of this Committee
in particular have gained a great insight into the problems
confronting the FBI in the security and intelligence fields --
problems which all too often we have been left to resolve
without sufficient guidance from the Executive Branch or
the Congress itself.

As in all human endeavors, errors of judgment
have been made. But no one who is looking for the cause
of our failures should confine his search solely to the
FBI, or even to the Executive Branch.

The Congress itself has long possessed the
mechanism for FBI oversight; yet, seldom has it been
exercised.

: An initial step was taken in the Senate in
1973 when the Committee on the Judiciary established

a Subcommittee on FBI Oversight. Hearings had been

-9-
DocId:32989503 Page 130



commenced, and we were fully committed to maximum
participation with the members of that Subcommittee.

I laud their efforts. However, those efforts
are of very recent origin in terms of the FBI's history.

One of the greatest benefits of the study
this Committee has made is the expert knowledge you have
gained of the complex problems confronting the FBI. But
I respectfully submit that those benefits are wasted if
they do not lead to the next step -- a step that I believe
is absolutely essential -~ a legislative charter, expressing
Congressional determination of intelligence jurisdiction for
the FBI.

Action to resolve the problems confronting us
in the security and intelligence fields is urgently needed;
and it must be undertaken in a forthright manner. Neither
the Congress nor the public can afford to look the other
way, leaving it to the FBI to do what must be done, as
too often has occurred in the past.

This means too that Congress must assume a
continuing role, not in the initial decision-making
process but in the review of our performance.

I would caution against a too-ready reliance
upon the Courts to do our tough thinking for us. Some
proposals that have been advanced during these hearings

would extend the role of the Courts into the early stages

NW 54965 DoclId:32989503 Page 131 -10-



i e e

of the investigative process and, thereby, would take
over what historically have been Executive Branch decisions.

I frankly feel that such a trend, if unchecked,
would seriously undermine the independence of the Judiciary
and cast them in a role not contemplated by the authors
of our Constitution. Judicial review cannot be a
substitute for Congressional oversight or Executive
decision.

The FBI urgently needs a clear and workable
determination of our jurisdiction in the intelligence
field, a jurisdictional statement that the Congress finds
to be responsive to both the will and the needs of the
American people.

Senators, first and foremost, I am a police
officer -- a career police officer. In my police experience,
the most frustrating of all problems that I have discovered
facing law enforcement in this country -~ Federal, state, or
local -- is when demands are made of them to perform
their traditional role as protector of life and property
without clear and understandable legal bases to do so.

I recognize that the formulation of such a
legislative charter will be a most precise and demanding

task.

-ill-
NW 54965 DociId:32989503 Page 132



It must be sufficiently flexible that it
does not stifle FBI effectiveness in combating the
growing incidence of crime and violence across the
United States. That charter must clearly address the
demonstrated problems of the past; yet, it must amply
recognize the fact that times change and so also do
the nature and thrust of our criminal and subversive
challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has
commenced the formulation of operational guidelines
governing our intelligence activities does not in any
manner diminish the need for legislation. The responsibility
for conferring jurisdiction resides with the Congress.

In this regard, I am troubled by some proposals
which question the need for intelligence gathering, suggesting
that information needed for the prevention of violence can
be acquired in the normal course of criminal investigations.

As a practical matter, the line between intelligence
work and regular criminal investigations is often difficult
to describe. What begins as an intelligence investigation
may well end in arrest and prosecution of the subject. But

there are some fundamental differences between these

paseeiy eoret
NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 133



investigations that should be recognized -- differences
in scope, in objective and in the time of initiation. In
the usual criminal case, a crime has occurred and it
remains only for the Government to identify the perpetrator
and to collect sufficient evidence for prosecution. _ Since
the investigation normally follows the elements of the
crime, the scope of the inquiry is limited and fairly
well defined.

By contrast, intelligence work involves
the gathering of information, not necessarily evidence.
The purpose may well be not to prosecute, but rather
to thwart erime or to insure that the Government has
enough information to meet any future crisis or emergency.
The inquiry is necessarily broad because it must tell
us not only the nature of the threat, but also whether
the threat is imminent, the persons involved, and the
means by which the threat will be carried out. The ability
of the Government to prevent criminal acts is dependent
on our anticipation of those unlawful acts. Anticipation,
in turn, is dependent on advance information -- that

is intelligence.

Certainly, reasonable people can differ on

these issues. Given the opportunity, I am confident

that the continuing need for intelligence work can be

documented to the full satisfaction of the Congress. We

NW 54965 Docld:32989503 Page 134 =o



recognize that what is at stake here is not the interests
of the FBI, but rather the interests of every citizen
of this country. We recognize also that the resolution
of these matters will demand extensive and thoughtful
deliberation by the Congress. To this end, I pledge the
complete cooperation of the Bureau with this Committee
or its successor in this important task.

In any event, you have my unqualified assurance
as Director that we will carry out both the letter and

the spirit of such legislation as the Congress may enact.

TERRORIST STATISTICS

Considerable interest in terrorist statistics was
shown by attendees at the Security Seminar of the Former
Special Agents meeting in Houston, Texas, on 11/7/75, addressed
by Assistant Director W. Raymond Wannall.

In the event you are contacted in regard to such
statistics, they are available on page 6, paragraphs 2 and 5,
of my “Statement on Terrorism," before the Subcommittee on
Internal Security, Senate Committee on Judiciary, November 19,
1975. Information in this statement, previously furnished all
offices, is now public source data.

In addition, further statistical data on terrorism
will be available in January, 1976, in the year-end review of
the FBI Domestic Terrorist Digest and the FBI Police Bulletin.

Death Threats

WASHINGTON (UPI)—The FBI said on Tuesday

it is investigating a threat to the lives of Democratic
presidential candidate Fred Harris, three mehibers
of Congress and a magazine editor in retaliation for
the murder of ‘CIA agent Richard Welch in, Gneece.

-, The members ‘of Congress
there Sen. Frank Church, D-
Thaho, and Reps. Otis Pike, D-
MM.Y., and Ronald Dellums, D-
@alif.. Church and Pike head .
congressional committees in-
vestigating activities of the
CIA. Dellums is a member of
the Pike committee.

A thretaening letter from the
“Veterans Against Communist
Sympathizers” also named Har-
ris and Tim Butz, a coeditor
of the magazine “counterspy”
which last year identified Welsh -
as CIA station chief in Peru.
Welsch had been transferred to
Greece.” - |
Letter in Houstom

Robert Franck, special agent
in charge of the FBI Houston
office, said the ietter was
delivered to Houston television
station KDOG-TV the day after
¢{aristmas. « ~

“St was a threat because of
the disclosure of Welch's iden-
ty which they said led to his

killing,” Franck said. “It
said it was a new organization
to step forth in America jand
was condemning to death all
Communists in America for
their part in Mr. Welch's death!
It was signed a Bless
America.’ ”
Harris Upset

Jim Hightower, a spokesman
for Harris, said, “We're not
going to put Fred in aw
armored car, He has talked
about abolishing certain covert
‘intelligence actions. We'll press
right ahead with - out. cam-

. Baiga.”

Hightower said it was “ap.
setting” that the FBI had not
informed Harris of the threat’
until his office enquired ‘about it
after hearing it mentioned on a

‘news broadcast on Tuesday. A

spokesman for Church said the
\senator’s office knew nothing.of -

COST OF RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES FROM

AND REQUESTS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF JNFORMATION
ANT) PRIVACY ACTS (FOIPA)

AS you are aware, the FBI is currently responding
Ito inquiries from various Congressional committees and agencies
such as the General Accounting Office. In addition, we are
having to devote ever larger amounts of resources to the
handling of requests under provisions of the FOIPA.

While much of the effort required to process these
matters is‘ expended at FBIHQ, the field offices are increas-
ingly being called on to give responses. From time to time
in the past, the cost of responding to the inquiry of a
lparticuler committee or agency has been monitored when this was
deemed appropriate.

Since it appears the high volume of incuiries will
continue for the foreseeable future, it is necessary to
provide for an efficient, standardized mechanism of collecting
lcost data and reporting the time spent servicing requests from
all oversight groups which will be instituted immediately.
The time spent on FOIPA matters will also be reported through
this centralized system. As major inquiries from new groups |
tare received, the time spent servicing’these requests should {
also be reported.

(Bo not type BEYOND ‘THIS MARGIN.)

Intelligence Probe’s ‘Sideshow’ Aspects

the material to make the committee look *

Certainly President Ford was not be-
ing serious in offering “all the services
and resources of the executive branch”
{including, apparently, FBI and Internal
Revenue Service agents) to help seal up
the “leaks” of the Select House Intelli-
gence Committee’s report, which has
not been made public due to “classified”
material therein.

First. of all, the leaks haven’t all
come-from the House or its Intelligence
Committtee. but from the executive

- branch itselfi—particularly from former

Director William E. Colby of the Central
Intelligence Agency—despite the state-
ment to reporters by White House Press
Secretary Ron Nessen that he was con-
fident that the leak in question “did not
come out of the executive branch.” (It
was Committee Chairman Otis G. Pike,
D-N.Y., whe prompted the President’s
offer. at least in part, by stating that the

sdministration itself mi 7 : try?
administration it sell might have leaked _,__cgunt ty aes

bad.)

Secondly, the President was surely -
being facetious in making his proposal
because he must know that few intelli-
gent members of the intelligence com-

mittee would agree to let the object of *

some of the committee’s investigations |
come and do a probe of some of its own’
problems.

The whole thing is beginning to look t
like a “Katzenjammer Kids” scenario..
When the nation has such tremendous
economic problems as heavy unemploy-
ment, the unresolved questions of energy
policy, idle plant capacity, and so forth,
we do not understand why our govern
mental leaders in Washington, D.C., are
still playing around ‘with this sort of a
sideshow. Why don’t they cut out the
political games and devote their energies

I welcome the opportunity to talk again with this

Subcommittee. During the months since I last testified
here there has been much discussion about various incidents
which I described to you last February 27 involving the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The FBI's domestic security investigations have
received the most attention. And much of it has centered on
COINTELPRO, which was revealed to this Subcommittee before I
arrived at the Department of Justice and about which I
provided further details by letter on May 17, 1975, when they
came to my attention.

From the beginning, this Subcommittee has been interested
in the. FBI's domestic security investigations. But it has
also been concerned with the whole range of FBI practices.
During my last appearance before this Subcommittee I promised
to start work preparing guidelines to govern FBI practices in
the future. The preparation of those guidelines has been slow
and difficult--much slower and more difficult than I had
realized. The problems are complex and important--as important
as any now facing the Department of Justice. I had hoped when

I first appeared before this Subcommittee that I would be

able to present to you at my next appearance a complete set

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 163



NW 54965

e -2- @ :

of guidelines. This has proven impossible. But progress
has been made in drafting guidelines in several areas. You
have been provided with the most recent drafts of proposed
guidelines covering White House inquiries, investigations for
congressional staff and judicial staff appointments, the handling
of unsolicited mail, and domestic security investigations.
These draft guidelines cover many of the areas that have been
of greatest concern to this Subcommittee.

Because the statutory base for the operation of the
FBI is not satisfactory, I know the members of this Subcommittee
have been considering what changes it should enact. The
guidelines may be helpful in these deliberations. Before
discussing briefly each of the draft guidelines you have seen,
I would like to make a few points about the question of
statutory changes.

The basic statutory provision concerning the FBI is
28 U.S.C. 533 which provides that the Attorney General may
appoint officials "(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against
the United States; (2) to assist in the protection of the
President; and (3) to conduct such investigations regarding
official matters under the control of the Department of Justice
and the Department of State as may be directed by the Attorney
General."" In addition, 28 U.S.C. 531 declares that the Federal

Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice. There

DocId:32989503 Page 164



@ sae e

are other statutes, such as the Congressional Assassination,
Kidnapping and Assault Act, which vest in the Bureau certain
special responsibilities to investigate particular eriminal
violations. There are also Executive Orders and Presidential
statements and directives placing investigatory responsibility
upon the Bureau.

In some areas--such as domestic security-~the simple
statutory base I have just described is overlaid with a
series of executive orders (for example, Executive Order 10450
concerning the federal loyalty program) and directives dating
back decades. The simplicity of the statute vanishes when
placed in this setting. Moreover, the authorized work of the
Bureau in terms of crime detection must be seen in the context
of statutes passed by Congress such as the Smith Act, 18 U.S.C.
2385, the seditious conspiracy law, 18 U.S.C. 2384, and the
rebellion and insurrection statute, 18 U.S.C. 2383. I would
like to begin the discussion today by suggesting a few
considerations that should be taken into account in deciding
what statutory changes should be made to define more clearly
the areas of the Bureau's jurisdiction and the means and
methods which the Bureau is permitted to use in carrying out
its assigned tasks.

First, there is a temptation to resort to having the
courts make many difficult day-to-day decisions about investigations.

When a Fourth Amendment search or seizure is involved, of

NW 54965 DoclId:32989503 Page 165



e aru e :

course, recourse to a court for a judicial warrant is in most
circumstances required. But the temptation is to extend the use
of warrants into areas where warrants are not constitutionally
required. For example, as you know it has been suggested
that the FBI ought to obtain a warrant before using an informant.
Extending the warrant requirement in this way would be a major
step toward an alteration in the basic nature of the criminal
justice system in America. It would be a step toward the
inquisitorial system in which judges, and not members of the
executive, actually control the investigation of crimes. This
is the system used in some European countries and elsewhere,
but our system of justice keeps the investigation and
prosecution of crime separate from the adjudication of criminal
charges. The separation is important to the neutrality of the
judiciary, a neutrality which our system takes pains to protect.
There is another, related consideration. To require
judges to decide whether particular informants may be used in
particular cases would bring the judiciary into the most
important and least definable part of the investigative process.
Even disregarding the problem of delay to investigations and
the burden that would be placed upon courts, we must ask our-
selves whether the control of human sources of information--
which involves subtle, day-to-day judgments about credibility
and personality--is something judges ought to be asked to
undertake. It would place an enormous responsibility upon courts
which either would be handled perfunctorily or, if handled with

care, would place a tremendous burden of work on federal judges.

NW 54965 DociId:32989503 Page 166



In drafting statutory changes, it must be remembered
that rigid directions governing every step in the investigative
process could sacrifice the flexibility that is necessary if
an investigative agency is to adapt to the diverse factual
situations it must face. Rigid statutory provisions would
invite litigation at every step in the investigative process.
Such litigation could very well be used by clever individuals
to frustrate legitimate law enforcement efforts without
achieving the measure of control for which the statutes were
enacted. As Lord Devlin has said, "As soon as anything has
been codified, there is a lawyer-like--but sometimes unfortunate--
tendency to treat the written word as if it were the last
word on the subject and to deal with each case according to
whether it falls on one side or the other of what may be a
finely drawn boundary."

These considerations do not in any way mean that Congress
ought not act to clarify the FBI's statutory base. I want
to emphasize my belief that Congress should do so. The

f problems I have mentioned are surmountable. The Department of

Justice is ready to work with Congress in drafting statutes

that will meet the issues that have been raised about the
responsibilities of the FBI.

The proposed guidelines are part of our effort to
cooperate with Congress in meeting its legislative responsibility.

Some of what has been proposed in the guidelines may be useful

yw 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 167 =

| Pee e

in drafting statutes, Other parts of the guidelines may
best be left to regulations or Executive Orders, As I said
in my earlier testimony before this Subcommittee, consultation
with you and with other Congressional committees is an
important part of the process by which these guidelines can
be perfected. There will not be complete agreement about what
has been proposed--indeed, within the Department of Justice
there is some disagreement about some provisions~-but this is
inevitable and is a necessary part of the road we must travel.
We welcome discussion, which is also essential. Let me then
briefly describe the four proposed guidelines that have been
substantially completed and have been provided to you. Others--
which will cover criminal investigations, use of informants,
counter-intelligence investigations and other areas--are
currently being drafted by a committee within the Department
chaired by Mary Lawton, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in
the Office of Legal Counsel, and composed of representatives
of the Civil Rights and Criminal Divisions, the Office of
Policy and Planning, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the Attorney General's Office. As new guidelines are drafted
in these areas they, too, will be made available to you.

When I testified before this Subcommittee last
February I described a number of incidents which occurred
in a period dating back more than a decade in which the
FBI was misused for political purposes. I noted that in

most cases we discovered where the White House was involved

NW 54965 Docld:32989503 Page 168



. g==eé@

the initiation of an improper request was made by a White
House staff member--acting in the President's name--to a
counterpart in the FBI, These requests were often made
orally. White House staff members in a number of different
positions were involved.

As you know, the FBI conducts background investigations
of persons being considered for appointment by the President
either to positions in government departments or agencies or
to the White House staff. The FBI also checks it files and
sometimes conducts further investigations of persons who will
be in contact with the President or who will be given access
to classified information. The guideline concerning White
House inquiries sets up a procedure--which is already
substantially being followed--which requires that requests
for all such investigations be made in writing by the President
or the Counsel or Associate Counsel to the President. Under
the proposed guidelines the request for an investigation would
have to certify that the person to be investigated has
consented to the investigation with the knowledge that information
gathered in the investigation would be retained by the FBI.

The consent provision is important as a mechanism for preventing
investigations in fact sought for political or other purposes
from being initiated in the use of background investigations.

that access to information provided to the White House be
strictly limited to those directly involved in the matter
for which the investigation was initiated. Custodians of
the files in the White House would be required to keep a
list of all persons who were given access, The proposed

guidelines concerning congressional staff and judicial staff

appointments take the same basic approach as the guidelines
concerning White House inquiries.

In addition the White House has been following the
practice, which perhaps should be embodied in the guidelines,
of directing through the Attorney General's Office all requests
for investigation or for material from Bureau files except
routine background checks. This was not the policy in the
past. It reflects the Attorney General's role, which I
described to you last year, as a lightning rod to deflect
improper requests.

The proposed guidelines on the White House inquiries

and on other matters accept the proposition that FBI files

should be destroyed after a reasonable period of time. The
deadlines for destruction of files have not yet been specified,
however, because for administrative reasons these deadlines
must be coordinated throughout the FBI file system.

' The last time I appeared before this Subcommittee many
members were concerned about the handling of unsolicited

derogatory information received by the FBI. Unsolicited

e aa e

information can be very valuable in law enforcement, as you
know, but the concern has been that allegations about the
private lives and habits of individuals have found their way
into FBI files where they may remain for great lengths of

time as a silent but troublesome invasion of individual

privacy. In my testimony of last February 27, I suggested

that on balance it would be desirable to devise some procedure
under which some information in Bureau files would be destroyed.
The guidelines concerning unsolicited information set up a
procedure for the early destruction_of such information when

it does not relate to matters within the jurisdiction of the

: federal government or does not make an allegation of a serious
erime within the jurisdiction of state or local police agencies.
The draft guidelines provide for destruction of such unsolicited
information within 90 days. The period after which other files
would be required to be destroyed may vary. Information collected
in background investigations might be retained long enough
to avoid the need to repeat investigative steps as an individual
moves from job to job within government or out of government
and later back in. On the other hand, destruction of files
developed in preliminary domestic security investigations may
be required quite quickly if information indicating criminal

conduct is not developed.

Finally I come to the proposed guidelines concerning
the controversial area of domestic security investigations.

I have already testified about these guidelines before the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Since that testimony,
several changes have been made in the draft. You have been
provided with the latest draft of these guidelines. There

are several important features I would like ‘to describe.

First, the proposed domestic security guidelines
proceed from the proposition that government monitoring of
individuals or groups because they hold unpopular or controversial
political views is intolerable in our society. This is the
meaning of the warning issued by former Attorney General

. Harlan Fiske Stone, as I read it. Stone said, "There is always
the possibility that a secret police may become a menace to
free government and free institutions, because it carries with
it the possibility of abuses of power which are not always
quickly apprehended or understood. . .It is important that
its activities be strictly limited to the performance of those
functions for whichit was created and that its agents themselves
be not above the law or beyond its reach. . .The Bureau of
Investigation is not concerned with political or other opinions
of individuals. It is concerned only with their conduct and

“then only with such conduct as is forbidden by the laws of
the United States. When a police system passes beyond these
limits, it is dangerous to the proper administration of justice
and to human liberty, which it should be our first concern to

cherish."

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 172



@ streets @

The proposed guidelines tie domestic security
investigations closely to the violation of federal law.
I realize there is an argument as to whether the guidelines
tie domestic security investigations closely enough or too
closely to the detection of criminal misconduct. But the
main thing in my opinion is that the purpose of the investigation
must be the detection of unlawful conduct and not merely the
monitoring of disfavored or troublesome activities and surely
not of unpopular views. This is accomplished in the guidelines
by requiring some showing that the activities under investigation
involve or will involve the use of force or violence and the
violation of federal law. I must admit there is a problem--
in part a drafting problem but perhaps more than that--of how
to describe or set forth a standard which further specifies what
is meant by "some showing."

: Because investigations into criminal conduct in the
domestic security area may raise significant First Amendment
issues, the proposed guidelines provide for compendious reporting
on such investigations to the Department of Justice. In general
the guidelines provide for a much greater involvement by the
rest of the Department of Justice and the Attorney General in
reviewing FBI domestic security investigations. The emphasis
upon departmental and congressional review is important, but
it must be recognized that the Bureau must have primary
responsibility for controlling itself. The guidelines attempt
to strike an appropriate balance. Periodic reports by the

Bureau of preliminary investigations would be required. All

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 173



@ -12- e

full investigations would have to be reported to the Attorney

General or his designee within one week of their opening. The
Attorney General or his designee could close any investigation.
FBI Headquarters would be required to review the results of
full investigations periodically and to close any when it
appears that the standard for opening a full investigation is
not satisfied and all logical leads have been exhausted or are
not likely to be productive. Each open case would be reviewed
annually in the Department of Justice and would be closed if
no longer justified under the standards. The personal approval
of the Attorney General would be required when such sensitive
techniques as Title III electronic surveillance or preventive
action are to be used, and the Attorney General would be
required to report to Congress periodically on the instances,
if any, in which preventive action was taken.
Preliminary investigations--which would not involve

the infiltration of informants into organizations or groups
or such techniques as electronic surveillance or mail covers--
would be authorized only on the basis of information or
allegations that an individual, or individuals acting in
concert, may be engaged in activities which involve or will
involve the use of force or violence and the violation of federal
law for one of five designated purposes. Those criminal
purposes are:

(1) overthrowing the government of

the United States or the government

of a State;

NW 54965 Docld:32989503 Page 174



“. ay e Santee @

(2) interfering, in the United States,
with the activities of a foreign
government or its authorized represen-
tatives;
(3) impairing for the purpose of
influencing U.S. government policies
or decisions:
(a) the functioning of the
government of the United States;
(b) the functioning of the
government of a State; or
(c) interstate commerce.
(4) depriving persons of their civil
vights under the Constitution, laws,
or treaties of the United States; or
(5) engaging in domestic violence or
rioting when such violence or rioting
is likely to require the use of the
federal militia or other armed forces.
Preliminary ‘Pvestigations would be limited to inquiries of
public record and other public sources; FBI files and indices;
federal, state and local records; and existing informants
and sources. Interviews and physical surveillance undertaken
for the limited purpose of identifying the subject of the
investigation would be allowed, but interviews or surveillance
for any other purpose would require the written authorization
of the Special Agent in Charge of the appropriate Bureau field

office.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 175

@ -14 - e Stet

The draft guidelines provide that such intrusive
investigative techniques as infiltration of informants into
organizations and use of electronic surveillance and mail
covers may only be initiated as a part of full investigations.
The guidelines set out the following standard for the opening
of a full investigation:

"Full investigations must be
authorized by the FBI Headquarters.
They may only be authorized on the
basis of specific and articulable

facts giving reason to believe that

an individual or individuals acting

in concert are or may be engaged in

activities which involve or will
involve the use of force or violence
and the violation of federal law for
one or more" of the five purposes I
mentioned.earlier.

A provision is also included to allow the FBI to
investigate for limited periods of time in situations in which
domestic violence or rioting not violating federal law is
likely to result in a request by a governor or legislature of
a state under 10 U.S.C. 331 for the use of federal troops.

You will recognize that the standard for opening a
full investigation proposed in the guidelines is the equivalent

of the standard for a street stop and frisk enunciated by

NW 54965 DoclId:32989503 Page 176



7 r - 15 - r ]

the Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio. There the Supreme Court
wrote that in justifying a street search a police officer “must
be able to point to specific and articulable facts which,

when taken together with rational inferences from those facts,
reasonably warrant the intrusion." In his summation of the
holding of the Court, Chief Justice Warren wrote:

We. . .hold today that where a police
officer observes unusual conduct which leads
him reasonably to conclude in light of his
experience that criminal activity may be
afoot and that persons with whom he is
dealing may be armed and presently dangerous,
where in the course of investigating this
behavior he identifies himself as a police-
man and makes reasonable inquiries, and
where nothing in the initial stages of the
encounter serves to dispel his reasonable
fear for his own or others' safety, he is
,entitled for the protection of himself
and others in the area to conduct a
carefully limited search of the outer
clothing of such persons in an attempt to
discover weapons which might be used to
assault him. (emphasis added) (392 U.S. 1, 30)

This standard was adopted because it requires a

strong showing of criminal conduct before a full investigation
is authorized. I should point out that a change was made

in this part of the guidelines since my testimony before

the Senate Select Committee. Originally the standard had
required a showing of specific and articulable facts giving
reason to believe that the subjects of the investigation are
engaged in activities that involve or will involve force and
violence and the violation of federal law. The change to the
phrase “are or may be" brings the\formulation of the

standard more closely in line with the Terry standard. The
previous language of the guidelines proved to be too close

to the arrest standard--that is, too restrictive as a
standard for the opening of an investigation. The close
correspondence of the revised draft's standard with the Terry
language gives the guidelines’ formulation a foundation in the
Supreme Court's analysis of an analagous constitutional problem
which, while it involves a different area of law enforcement,
does provide a definition for the standard which is to control
Bureau activities.

The proposed guidelines go on to require an additional
consideration before a full investigation is opened. The
guidelines state:

[T]he following factors must be
considered in determining whether a

full investigation should be undertaken:
(1) the magnitude of the threatened

harm;

DocId:32989503 Page 178



re e a @

(2) the likelihood it will occur;

(3) the immediacy of the threat;

and

(4) the danger to privacy and free

expression posed by a full investi-

gation.
This listing of factors, which has been added in the latest
draft, gives the standard a dimension and explicitness it
did not have in earlier drafts. For example, the balancing
of the factors would require officials of the FBI and the
Department of Justice to close any full investigation even
if there is clear threat of a violation of federal law if
the threatened harm is de minimus or unlikely or remote in
time.

Finally, the draft guidelines provide a procedure to
be followed in emergency situations when action by the FBI to
‘intervene to prevent the use of illegal force and violence
may be required. This section of the proposed guidelines
has proven to-be controversial, in part for fear that it
seeks to allow the FBI to engage in activities of the sort
that were involved in COINTELPRO. As I have said many times
before, the activities that went under the name COINTELPRO
were either foolish or outrageous, and the preventive action
section of the guidelines was not intended to legitimize
such activities, nor would it do so. It was included in the
draft guidelines in the recognition that emergency situations

may arise in which human life or the essential functioning

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 179



@ - 18 - @ ia

of government may be threatened, In such situations law
enforcement officials would be expected to act to save life
or protect the functioning of government. Indeed, law
enforcement officials would be condemned if they did not act.
The preventive action section of the guidelines was designed
to provide a procedure for the Attorney General to authorize
and report to Congress such activities. It was designed to
set up an orderly and careful procedure to be followed in
the case of emergency. It could be supplemented by further
rules developed by the Attorney General. Under the proposed
guidelines the Attorney General could authorize a preventive
action only when there is probable cause to believe that
illegal force or violence will be used and that it threatens
life or the essential functioning of government. The Attorney
General could authorize preventive action only when it is
necessary to minimize the danger, that is, when other techniques
will not work. In the latest draft of the guidelines several
specific prohibitions were included. to make clear that new
COINTELPRO are not to be sanctioned. Prohibited are the
commission in instigation by the FBI of criminal acts; the
dissemination of information for the purpose of holding an
individual or group up to scorn, ridicule, or disgrace; the
dissemination of information anonymously or under false
identity; and the incitement of violence.

It may be that Congress will choose to prohibit any
FBI efforts to intervene to prevent force or violence. But

to do so carries with it a risk and a responsibility.

The proposed guidelines ‘are still in the process of
revision. They are tentative. As the guidelines have
been developed they have been shown to the Chairman of this
Subcommittee. We must enunciate the differences among us
about the best words to use and then seek to resolve those
differences. But the main thrust of the guidelines is surely
the most important thing, their recognition of the need for a
program for destruction of files in the interest of privacy,
their requirement of consent £rom the subject of background
investigations, their requirement of progressively higher
standards and higher levels of review for more intrusive
investigative techniques, their requirement that domestic
security investigations be tied closely with the detection
of crime, and their safeguards against investigations of
activities that are merely troublesome or unpopular. Upon
these main themes I hope we all agree.

The Department of Justice has undertaken other steps
to meet some of the issues of concern to this Subcommittee.
We have created an Office of Professional Responsibility to
investigate allegations of improper conduct by Department
personnel and to review the investigations done by internal
inspection units of agencies within the Department. We have
been trying to work out a legislative proposal to bring
national security wiretapping and microphone surveillance

under a judicial warrant procedure. On June 24, 1975, I

7 NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 181



e co e

‘provided the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee with
statistics concerning the use of national security electronic
surveillance instituted without prior judicial approval.
Before the Church Committee I recounted the history of
national security electronic surveillance since 1940, revealing
a year-by-year count of the number of telephone and microphone
surveillances. The latest figures in this area show that in
1975 a total of 122 telephone wiretaps and 24 microphone
devices were used to overhear conversations.

We have tried to be cooperative with this and other
committees of Congress about other aspects of :the past history
of the FBI and other agencies within the Department. We have
tried to reveal as much as possible about the past out of a
sense of comity and a feeling that the past problems must be
discussed in the process of creating new policy. But we have
tried also to recognize that the past is not always the best
guide to the future, As we review recent history we may be so
overwhelmed by it--and by our failure of memory about the social
and political forces that shaped recent history--that we will
read. its Lessons more broadly than we ought to. If there was
a lack of humility in the past about the perfection of our
vision of what was proper, I hope we cannot fail to recognize

the flaws in our vision about the past and the future today.

54965 Docld:32989503 Page 182



It is a challenging and interesting time, and I hope
together we can prepare ourselves wisely for the future. We
cannot escape from the responsibility of looking at the problems
we face today and are likely to face in the future.

When I testified almost one year ago I stated to this
committee--and I want to emphasize most strongly again today--
that I have both a personal and official concern for the issues
which face us in this area, Those issues are close to the basic
duties of the Attorney General to protect the society--its
values, and the safety of its members. I am sure that
Director Kelley will agree with me that we must clarify for
the present and for the future the kind of course to be
followed, meticulously and candidly. I believe we have already
made considerable progress in this regard. Together with

Congress legislation can be worked out and wise policy achieved.

“

As the Supreme Court has observed: "...unless
Government safeguards its own capacity to function and to
preserve the security of its people, society itself could
become so disordered that all rights and liberties would
be endangered."

As a practical matter, the line between domestic
security work and investigations of ordinary crime is often
difficult to describe. What begins as an intelligence
investigation may well end in arrest and prosecution of
the subject.

I want to emphasize that these investigations are
not undertaken for the purpose of collecting information on

_. those who hold unpopular or controversial political views.
Their focus is on conduct, not ideas -- conduct that involves
or is likely to involve a violation of Federal law.

But the important distinguishing characteristic of
a successful domestic security case is prevention -- they are
undertaken primarily to thwart illegal activities, not to
prosecute. As a consequence, intelligence work involves the
.gathering of information, not necessarily evidence. The purpose
is to insure that the government has enough information at its

disposal to either frustrate or minimize the consequences of

, aw 54965 DocId:32889503 Page 185



I wish to thank the Committee for the opportunity
to contribute my views for your consideration on legislative
policies and guidelines for the FBI.

My understanding is that your primary concern at
this time is the FBI's investigative résponsibilities in the
domestic security area.

We must consider first that these investigations
deal with activities posing a threat to orderly and legally

constituted government -~ interests which the government has

a special obligation to protect.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 186 |



om

the intended harm. As the Supreme Court put it, "the emphasis
of domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of
unlawful activity or the enhancement of the Government's
preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency."

If we are to accomplish these objectives, the FBI
must initiate the investigation in advance of the crime. The
ability of government to prevent criminal acts threatening
domestic security is dependent on our anticipation of their
occurrence. Anticipation, in turn, is dependent on advance
information -- that is intelligence. Moreover, the interests
involved are too important for the government to wait until
the crime is imminent or an attempt is made before it begins
its investigative activity.

Let's consider, for the moment, the problem of
terrorism.

.Terrorist acts are increasing globally; but more
to the point, terrorist activity is growing in the United
States.

There were 89 bombings attributable to terrorist
_activity in 1975 -- an average of seven a month. That was
almost double the number in 1974 (45) and more than three

times the number in 1973 (24).

: NW 54965 DociId:32989503 Page 187



e e oe

Eleven people were killed in terrorist acts in-

1975 -- six of them in bombings. Seventy-six persons were
injured in these bombings. Property damage amounted to more
than $2.7 million.

Who is responsible for these brutal and destructive
acts?

~-The New World Liberation Front, a revolutionary
group operating primarily in California, boasted of committing
19 bombings. A public utility company was its primary victim.

--The Armed Forces of Puerto Rican Liberation, or
FALN, claimed 18 bombings and one unsuccessful attempt. The
group's favorite targets were government and corporate
facilities -- especially banks -- in New York City, Chicago,
and Washington, D. C.

The FALN took credit for the bloodiest terrorist
bombing last year, the explosion that killed four people and
injured 53 others on January 24, 1975, at Fraunces Tavern in
New York City. Fraunces Tavern was where George Washington
said farewell to his troops in 1783, and it is the former
home of the New York Stock Exchange. i

The FALN's destructive capabilities were amply
demonstrated on October 27, 1975, by its claimed responsibility

for its coordinated, simultaneous attacks on government and

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 188



pry
+ im

- business buildings in New York, Chicago and Washington, D. C.
The explosions marked the observance of the first anniversary
of the FALN's existence.

--Other destructive bombings were claimed by the
Continental Revolutionary Army, Red Guerrilla Family, George
Jackson Brigade, Emiliano Zapata Unit and the Chicano Liberation
Front.

The Weather Underground claimed three bombings and
one attempt in 1975. One of the blasts was at the State
Department in Washington; an attempt fizzled at a Department
of Defense facility in Oakland, California.

Four recently published issues of the Weather
Underground's newsletter, "Osawatomie," contained this threat
regarding our Nation's Bicentennial, July 4, 1976: "The rulers
have set the time for the party; let us bring the fireworks."

It should be obvious from this appalling list of violence
that we are not as successful as we would hope to be in dealing
with such matters. But there have been numerous cases where
information gathered in domestic security investigations made it
possible to thwart or minimize violence or to make prompt arrests,
preventing further incidents of violence. Let me give you a

graphic example.

NW 54965 Docld:32989503 Page 189



r e

In August of 1974, a bomb was discovered at the
United Nations. Two days after the occurrence, the Louisville
FBI Office received information that an attempt had been made
to recruit a resident of Kentucky to participate in a crime to
be committed at the United Nations.

Information gathered during a prior domestic security
investigation made possible the identification of the individual
making the attempted recruitment. As a result of continued
investigation, this same individual was convicted and sentenced
to serve 25 years.

In addition to terrorist groups, we are also faced with
individuals or organizations who are dedicated to the eventual
violent overthrow of this government. I know there are those
who feel that the government ought not to concern itself or
expend its investigative resources on the prevention of what

might be a remote or highly unlikely occurrence. Reasonable

people can differ on the proper governmental response to these

situations.

Suppose an organization openly espouses revolutionary
doctrine, that is to say, the use of force and violence to
overthrow the government. But it is clear that they will not
take immediate action, or if they did, that they would not be

successful. In the meantime, they actively recruit new members,

INW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 190



Nw 54965

and attempt to strengthen their financial resources -- and

wait for the proper moment. I recognize that advocacy alone is

not a violation of Federal law, nor am I suggesting that we make

it one. I am aware also of the special constitutional problems
that are presented by these cases. As Justice Powell put it,

the investigative duty of the executive may be stronger in such
matters, but "so also is there greater jeopardy to constitutionally
protected speech."

It has always been my philosophy as a law enforcement
officer that the government should strive at all times to meet
its obligations for the maintenance of security with the least
possible intrusion on the affairs of its citizens.

But what would you have us do about the presence of
revolutionary organizations in our society? Should they be
totally ignored on the premise that somehow government will
receive an adequate warning that violence is imminent and will be
able to take the necessary measures to prevent the crime or
at least to minimize its consequences. Where is the warning
to come from, if not even the most preliminary and minimal
kind of inquiry is permitted?

As the head of the principal Federal law enforcement
agency in the country, I feel that I would be remiss in my

duties if I were to ignore any group that advocates violence to

DocId:32989503 Page 191 . ue



° e i

accomplish its objectives. Indeed, the Congress has passed a
number of Federal statutes over which the Bureau has investigative
responsibilities, all of which are designed to secure the internal
security of this Nation.

.It may well be that the government's investigative
response in such matters should be carefully measured and need
not be as exhaustive or intrusive as our investigations into
completed crimes, particularly those of terrorist groups. But
I submit it would be unrealistic to prevent the government from
obtaining information needed by the executive for sound judgments
about the nature and extent of the threat posed at any given time
by such organizations.

However secure we may feel today about the strength
and durability of this Nation -- and we have every reason to
feel that way -- no one among us can claim any special knowledge
about what tomorrow will bring. Legislation adopted in today's
climate which severely limits the ability of government to
respond effectively to such matters may well prove too
restrictive to meet the needs of the future.

I recognize that Congressional concern in the area
‘of domestic security investigations has been prompted by past

mistakes or errors in judgment. My own view is that there is

NW 54965 DoclId:32989503 Page 192



cae a r)

no institutional mechanism that can guarantee integrity in

government. In the final analysis, we must place our trust
in individuals. But I realize that more must be done -- it
is not enough to rely on self-restraint.

We have made a commitment to review past FBI
procedures and practices. Investigations in the domestic
security area have been reduced significantly since July 1973.

As you are aware, the FBI is participating with other
representatives of the Department of Justice in the drafting of
guidelines to govern various areas of FBI operations including
domestic security investigations. These guidelines represent
a positive response to the need for a delineation of the FBI's
proper role and will provide for control’and review of the
FBI's performance.

Those portions of the guidelines dealing with the
jurisdictional basis of domestic security investigations are
an appropriate subject for legislation. Other sections might
be put into effect by regulation or Executive Order. Views
may differ on the precise form or content of the guidelines.
Whatever the outcome, they represent a conscientious effort
“to deal with one of the most difficult and complex areas of

our investigative responsibilities.

NW 54965 DociId:32989503 Page 193



The resolution of these matters will demand extensive
and thoughtful deliberation by the Congress. In that regard, I
pledge the complete cooperation of the Bureau and assure you
that we will carry out both the letter and spirit of such

legislation as the Congress may enact.

No Case for Spééial Prosecuté

Sen, Frank Church is most uncon-
vincing with his hasty proposal that yet
another investigation and possible prose-
cution of alleged wrongdoing by CIA and
FBI personnel in the past shouid be han-
died by a special prosecutor and not by
the Justice Department.

This seems a wholly unnecessary de-
parture from normal procedure. Sen.
Church chairs the select Senate commit-
tee that is winding up a months-long
probe of FBI, CIA and other intelli-
gence activities. Such investigating com-
mittees customarily turn over any evi-
dence of suspected illegal actions to the
Justice Department for appropriate fol-
low-up.

But Sen. Church says this weuld be
unwise here, since the FBI, as one of
the targets of his probe, is a bureau
within the Justice Department. That is
true enough, but it does not mean that
the Justice Department is incapable of
performing its normal law enforcement

sponsibility, Most of the evidence cited
by Sen. Church concerns events that

long predated the tenure of the present

attorney general, Edward H. Levi. He
was confirmed by the Senate only a year
ago and no cne.has suggested that he
has any personal conflicts of interest.

Quite understandably, Atty. Gen. Levi
has described the Church recommenda-
tion of a special prosecutor as an “at-
tack on the integrity” of the department
since it assumes that the “ordinary law
enforcement mechanism cannot be
trusted,”

With Sen. Church, we believe that
anyone responsible for illegal acts on
which the statute of limitations has not
expired should be prosecuted. But this
should be done through regular proce-
dures, with those responsible for han-
dling the matter held strictly account-
able to Congress and the American peo-
ple. To remove that fob from the Jus-
ice Department would be to undermine
confidence in it without compelling

President Ford’s move to ‘revamp
the U.S. foreign intelligence system pro-
fesses to lay out objectives which in
themselves are sound: To restore con-

ce operations overseas while at the
same time to guard against abuses
abroad and a repeat of those that have
cecurred against our citizens at home.
{ the objectives sound solid, the
nechods by which Ford is moving—and
the potentist results—are frightening.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

STATEMENT OF
CLARENCE M. KELLEY
DIRECTOR
FEDERAL BUREAU Of INVESTIGATION
BEFORE THE
COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS
U. S. SENATE :
WASHINGTON, D. C.

JANUARY 26, 1976

Docld:32989503 Page 197



I want to thank you for giving me the
opportunity to appear before this Committee concerning
a most important issue -- that of oversight.

For some months now, the FBI has undergone a most
exhaustive review of its intelligence operations, as have
other members of the intelligence community. This review

has covered both domestic and foreign intelligence

operations of the FBI.
An@ I- am hopeful that the results of these
extensive reviews will be helpful to the Congress as it considers

practical recommendations for legislative oversight.

|. NW 54965 Docid:32989503 Page 198



The FBI has in the past recognized and, indeed,
requested a clear delineation of its intelligence responsi-
bilities and authority to conduct investigations in this
extremely sensitive area.

We realize that Congress faces a difficult task
if it decides to Graft oversight legislation that will be
of lasting benefit to the American people. Many issues are
involved, and most of them are not easily resolved.

The primary responsibility for correctness
of FBI activities rests in its Director -- a responsibility
I readily assume.

I would like to offer for your consideration some
of the basic questions-I believe must ke answered: ;

(1) Should Congressional responsibilities

for oversight of the FBI be consolidated?

(2) Should Congress become actively involve

in the decision-making process of the
administration of the FBI?

(3) What is the proper degree -~ and mode --

of Congressional access to FBI information?

(4) What-clearance procedures and controls should

al be established for staff members of a

Congressional oversight committee?

Tense Seah eseneeen



NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 200

im As I have previously testified before a

Congressional -Committee and mentioned here today, the

decisions in the FBI are mine and I assume full

responsibility for them. I think the point merits
reiteration.. Some of the mistakes in the past were
occasioned by direct orders from higher authorities ‘outside
the FBI.

We have welcomed Attorney General Levi's guidance,
counsel, and his continuous availability, in his own words,
“as a ‘lightning rod' to deflect improper requests."

Within days after taking office, Attorney General
Levi instructed that I immediately report to him any requests
or practices which, in my judgment, were improper or which,
considering the context of the request, I believed presented
the appearance of impropriety.

I can assure you, also, that in my administration
of the FBI I bring to the attention of the Attorney General
and the Deputy Attorney General major policy questions,
including those that arise in my continuing review of
our operations and practices. These are discussed openly and

candidly so that the Attorney General can disci

axge his
responsibilities with regard to the FBI.
There is no question in my mind that the basic

structure of the FBI is sound; but it would be a mistake to



® e

think that integrity can be assured only through institutional
means.

Integrity is a human quality. And the integrity
of the FBI therefore is dependent upon the character of the
Director of the FBI and every member of the FBI under him.
It will always be so.

I am sure you are aware the Attorney General
ereated a committee of Department and FBI representatives
to draft guidelines governing FBI investigations. These
quidelines have been discussed with various comhittees of
Congress and although not finalized at this time, they
could prove beneficial in the administration of the FBI.

EZ would like to comment briefly on the matter
of determining the degree and method of access to FBI files
granted to a committee having oversight responsibility.

I believe such detexmination must carefully
consider the questions raise@ as to the protection of the
integrity of such matter aside from privagy considerations. *
Much of the information received by the Bureau is furnished
voluntarily, not only by individuals but by cooperative
fcreign governments. They do so in return for an express or
implied promise of confidentiality. The FBI regards such

promises as binding.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 201



@ ; e@

The establishment of unlimited access could
seriously jeopardize the flow of volunteered information
which is the lifeblood of our investigative organization.

As the number of persons having access to highly
sensitive materials is increased, the chance of an intentional
or inadvertent disclosure also increases.

A perfectly well~intentioned person who legitimately
comes into possession of sensitive information may well
forget, at a later time and in another position, the
circumstances under which he acquired the information.

Law enforcement in this Nation is largely dependent
upon citizen cooperation. ‘Should citizens no longer have
any assurance their identities will be protected, the very
foundation of cooperation upon which the Bureau is so reliant
will be shaken.

Our legitimate concern in this area is borne out
by the fact courts continue to recognize the special legal
status accorded informants in the law enforcement community,
in that their true identities are protected.

Should the identities of informants be jeopardized
by the unnecessary proliferation of information, there will
be a severe impact on the ability of the FBI to discharge

its mandated responsibilities.

| NW 54965 Docld:32989503 Page 202



| NW 54965 DocId:32989503

We are also concerned

about the countless

public-spirited citizens who come forward voluntarily with

information essential for the FBI to function effectively.

Other extremely valuable sources of such information

are cooperative agencies in this country and abroad.

Should

the FBI be required to relinquish, over our objections,

information of this nature, it is quite likely we would be

denied such information in the future.

The Select Committees

have received unprecedented

access to information from the FBI, within agreed limits; but

we must ask whether the same degree of access should be

allowed, or is essential to, an

with regard to the FBI.
our diligent cooperation in

stems, in part, from our

own commitment to review the actions of the FBI in the past

in order to better judge the proper role of the FBI in the

future.

An excellent example of this commitment is the

fact we have reduced the number

of our domestic intelligence

investigations by 64 percent since July, 1373.

Page 203



"

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 204

As of July 31, 1973, we were handling 21,414
such investigations. By October 30, 1975, we had reduced
that total to 7,686 pending domestic intelligence cases --

a decline of 13,728 cases.

I think this is solid evidence of our responsiveness
even prior to the drafting of proposed guidelines for such
investigations. It isn't necessary for a house to fall on us -~
much less two houses.

So I feel compelled to raise this question:

Will the good of the country be better served by
continuing an extraordinary degree of direct Congressional
access to FBI information, or will it be better served by placing
emphasis on requiring the FBI Director to be fully accountable
to an oversight committee through sworn testimony?

I think the Congress and the FBI can perform their
respective tasks with the most advantageous results by the
latter means.

Now, also, I would strongly suggest that consideration
be given to the employment of a permanent, professional staff --
to the extent necessary ~~ for any proposed oversight committee,
with stringent clearance procedures.

This would allow the staff members to become
thoroughly knowledgeable concerning the FBI's procedures and
practices and, thereby, facilitate the work of the committee

with proper security.



. |
+ @ is e@ . .

As we seek to define the proper degree of
oversight, or review, of FBI operations, we must consider
the administrative burdens such oversight involves.

I should point out that in responding to requests
of the two Select Committees, the FBI at its headquarters
alone expended 3,976 days of Agent personnel and 1,964 davs
of clerical personnel from April through December, 1975 --
manpower diverted from investigative duties. In deliars
and cents that represents a cost of approximately $640,500.
Additionally, the cost of conducting background investigations
of committee staff members had reached about $393,699 through
last month.

Now these figures do not take into account personnel
utilized in responding to requests of other committees of
Gongress, which have substantially increased during the
past year.

Many of the requests we receive from Congress are
duplicative in nature. Though we diligently try to respond
fully and accurately in each and every instance, it is a
time-consuming and costly chore. And I feel strongly that
the interests of the American people would be best served
by Congress consolidating its oversight functions.

The manpower of the FBI is limited. With the

increased burden placed on the Bureau by Congressional Committee

i NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 205

|
id e

requests, and Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act
requests, we have reached the point where the Bureau's
ability to perform its normal investigative functions has
been impaired.

So I would urge you to consider these matters in
your deliberations concerning oversight legislation. I
assure you we will continue to cooperate to the best of
our ability. And I can further assure you that under a
Director held fully accountable and reporting at intervals
to an oversight committee, the FBI can perform effectively
and honorably.

Thank you.

Testimony before the Committee on
Government Oper' ons, 1-26-76

QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR RIBICOFF

Mr. Kelley, Do you believe that there should be a
Congressional Oversight Committee handling
intelligence matters?

I believe in oversight, Senator. I do not know
whether you mean one which is separated from
the criminal activities performed by the FBI

or not. If it be fragmented, I do not

believe that such should be done. I subscribe
to an oversight of both the intelligence activ-
ities in the domestic and foreign security and
the criminal.

I do not think it is anyone's intention in the
oversight committee to take care of the day-
to-day problems that the criminal oversight
has domestically, but in the counterintelli-
gence field, do you believe that there should
be such an oversight committee?

I do believe that it is necessary that we do
have oversight.

Mr. Colby testified last week that, in his
opinion, after reporting to eight committees,

he feels that the socner such an oversight
committee is created, the better off the
intelligence community would be. Do you believe
with Mr. Colby?

I do.

In your statement on page 3--I quote you-~you
state that “Some of the mistakes in the

past were occasioned by direct orders from higher
authorities outside the FBI." Could you please
tell us what mistakes and which higher authorities
you are referring to?

I am referring to the requests, the orders that
have come to us from members of the Department
of Justice, the Attorney General, and these stem
from the installation of some of our electronic
survéillances and from programs that we have
followed which have been with the authority of,
and approval of, those in this area. There are
not~-I do not have a complete outline of them,
but we da have instances where the FBI did not
initiate these. The orders came from outside
our organization and from, of course, The White
House on some o¢casions.

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

DocId: 32989503

Do you believe that such requests have been
improper under the authority of the FBI?

I do not think by any means that they come
under the purview of the FBI.

What should a director of the FBI do if he
receives an order from the President, or the
Attorney General or someone in the White House
staff that you believe contrary to what your
responsibilities and authorities are? What
should a Director do under those circumstances?

First, I think that he should deliberate and

talk with the Attorney General, if it be one not
coming from the Attorney General and get his
determination. if it be one where there is_

some doubt, he should get it in writing. If it
be one that he does not under any consideration
nor as a result of deliberation wherein an

effort is made to convince him, but he himself
does not feel that it is advisable then he should
withdraw, he should resign. And as I was once told
by Senator Byrd during confirmation, it is noped
that in such an instance that he would come to the
oversight committee of the Congress and consult
with them about what should be done undey these
circumstances. Of course, that is a matter which
the Director himself has to arrive at, and I am
already committed to, and still subscribe to, the
proposition that I am not going to give way just
because it comes from higher authority.

If the President of the United States makes

a request of you that you believe to be
improper, and cf course, he is your boss,

you would feel honor-bound under those circum-
stances to resign as Director of the FBI?

T£ it came to the final crunch, yes.

Po you believe that an FBI Director should
have a definite term in office?

I have been asked this before. I am not uncom-
fortable under the present system where my term
of office is from day to day. I do not believe
that there should be any grearer tenure than that.
Insofar as a limitation on how long he can be
Director, I feel that nine or ten years is
sufficient. I do subscribe to that.

Page 208



QUESTION: You say also on page 3 that when Mr. Levi
became Attorney General, he instructed you to
report to him any requests or practices which,
in your judgment, were improper or presented
the appearance of impropriety. Have you made
such reports to Mr. Levi?

MR. KELLEY: Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Are they confidential, or could you describe
generally the nature and frequency of such
improper requests?

MR. KELLEY: Most of them have been in the area of Cointel
Programs which we have discovered ourselves in
some of our file reviews. I can remember
another where we determined that there were
certain mail openings which we did not know
about until we accidentally discovered them.

It was not a failure to inform us, but

they thought that this was an ongoing program

that had been given official approval.

There was no thought that it was something that
should be hidden. -We did discover them in the

top echelon of the FBI and, therefore, the thought
is they were new to us--they were also new to

Levi and we informed him about them.

QUESTION: - In your testimony you stated that the Bureau has
reduced a number of pending domestic intelli-
gence investigations from 21,414 in 1973 to
7,686 by October 30, 1975. How do you explain
this? Were there too many investigations being
conducted two years prior?

MR. KELLEY: Senator, when I first came in, I talked with the man
in charge of our Intelligence Division. That is
the one where we handle the security matters, and
it was our opinion, together, that there were too
many investigations being conducted in the
security field. I asked him to review the
bases on which we conduct our investigations.
Obviously it became apparent that some of our
fields of attention could be under close
serutiny. I felt some undue extensions of our
investigatory capabilities and t was @ contin-
uing process, and the reduction was not something
that was immediate, but extended from, I wouid say,
the latter part of '73 when we got ourselves
lined up, right through to October, as it says
in my statement, of '75. We looked over why

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 209


4
are 6 doing certain things, an@+ might

well pe, as is many times true in investigative
circles, that you might get a little too
concerned about something that on close scrutiny
may not have been quite as alarming as it first
seems. This is not at all unusual.. It is,
however, unusual that it comes from within

and yes, as a result of the realignment of our
goals--realignment of our procedures--our

basis for investigating matters, we did bring
about this reduction.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you. Senator Percy?

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I would
like to thank Mr. Kelley for his demonstrated
desire and wiliingness to work with members of
Congress and to help us fulfill our responsibilities.

Former Attorney General Katzenbach testified
last week that he often did not know what the
FBI was doing. What is your own working
relationship with the present Attorney General?
Do you keep him informed of all the major
activities that the FBI is undertaking? Does he
participate in deciding whether or not you
undertake major undertakings?

MR. KELLEY: Senator, we certainly keep him informed of
any major program. I would say that perhaps
we may, on occasion, over-inform him. We may
tell him about things that are antici-
patory as far as problems are concerned. We try to
keep him fully informed. For example, if there
happens to be something we learn about that
may cause press inquiries of him, we inform
him of that. Many times they are made.
I just point this out inasmuch as we are trying
valiantly to keep him informed.

QUESTION: When do you anticipate new guidelines for the
FBI being finalized?

WR. KELLEY: I cannot give you this response. It has been
several months in preparation. I know that it
has now been thrown back into the hopper for
re-evaluation. I cannot tell you-~-perhaps
Mr. Levi can give you better information in
that regard.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 210



QUESTION: As oF on that first, qu@@tion, to
5 be certain that I complete the record on it,
can you think now in retrospect in anything in
your term of office as Director of the FBI
that you really should have advised the Attorney
General of that you maybe subsequently did,
but did not at the time?

MR. KELLEY: I cannot think of anything, Senator.

QUESTION: I asked that, because Dean Rusk said that he
subsequently has now learned of certain
things undertaken in foreign countries by, say,
the CIA that he thought at the time he knew
everything going on, he now learns he did not
know, and I wanted to complete that record.

You talk about unlimited access to your files

. ? being dangerous, and I do not think anyone tontem-
7 Plates that whatsoever, but I do not think

either that you should be left in the position
where just your word is the only thing that an
Oversight Committee has. What do you think is
proper in this respect with respect to reference
to files?

MR. KELLEY: I think that there should be a working arrange-
Ment between our people and whatever group
might have oversight, and there is a strong
requirement that there not be presentation of
material which would first compromise a source
of information, whether that be a citizen,
a government, or an informant. The confiden-
tiality of the work done by the FBI is an
extremely important thing. Names are not just
all that reveal the identity. It may
be that certain circumstances, when revealed, may
pinpoint what might be the source of
information. There might be also too great
a proliferation of information about some activity
of the FBI. :

For example, we have, of course, warrantless
wiretaps. We feel that there should be
confidentiality of that. These have been

authorized through the approval of the President
through the Attorney General's delegated

authority in this regard. I would say generally

that if there be a reasonable basis whereby we

can explain that it should be maintained confidential
that it be so maintained. On the other hand, we
should extend ourselves in the spirit of

_ NW_54965 DocId:32989503 Page 211



ait

fe ee to inform and to reW%t on measures,
and if they want a review that we extend
ourselves to let them make such review.

QUESTION: You have been able to reduce your domestic
intelligence investigations by 64 percent
since July, 1973. Can you tell us how you have
done that?

MR. KELLEY: By a review that we started in mid-1973 looking
over the bases for our investigatory needs and
eur intelligence operations, and generally to
take an inventory and say which should we
continue, which should we now perhaps give
additional emphasis, and we culled out, in
other words, those which we did not feel were strictly
productive insofar as meeting our commitments.

QUESTION: Did you find that you eliminated some of those,
Mr. Kelley, because they were illegal, in
retrospect, as you look back and decided
that the FBI should not, as a law enforcement agency,
should not engage in illegal practices in investigations?

MR. KELLEY: You know, when you speak of illegality, we have
great difficulty. Sometimes, in the context of
the time, you may opén matters which later are
determined to be perhaps possible civil rights
investigations, invasions of privacy, or other
background objections. I do not know of any
which, I would say, were actually illegal. 1f
just do not recall any that would meet that

| classification.

QUESTION: Were some eliminated because they may have
been borderline, and in retrospect in numerality,
you decided not to go ahead?

MR. KELLEY: I would say that that is a possibility. In
: a strict classification or interpretation
i. they may be termed an invasion of privacy
|* or rights or something of that type.

QUESTION: Were most cf them eliminated because
you felt they were not productive, and to
use a phrase, they were not really cost-effective,
for the amount of energy and effort put into
then? They would not have paid off?

E NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 212



MR. KELLEY: TI Wa say that those would oo great and
major reasons.

QUESTION: With the workload declining 64 percent, has
there been any decline at all in manpower?
Have you shifted manpower to other Division--
«.sperson power, excuse me; man or womanpower-—
have you shifted it to other divisions?

MR. KELLEY: There has been some shifting; much of our
so-called overload of manpower or investigative
attention by this Division has been picked up
by the terroristic activities investigations. Of
course, we have had a great rise in that: ° doubled
each year. And, strangely enough, during 1975, it
even increased more than that. We had more
terrorist-type of bombings in 1975 than we
had in 1974.

QUESTION: You mentioned the burden that has been placed
on the FBI by the Congress. TI presume that
there is not any question that the CIA could
rightfully maintain that a tremendous burden
has placed on it by the Congress now.
I think, in retrospect and in fairness, a part
ef the burden is unfair, unwarranted, and not
cost-effective. But a large part of the burden is
placed simply because we have recognized that we failed
the American people in the past, and no one has
more clearly admitted this than the Majority
leader of the Senate, Senator Mansfield, in his
opening statements before the committee. So
that we have to rectify that. We may overkill,
in a sense. I hope we will not. I hope that we will
go a prudent, moderate path and not overreact
to the situation. But a large part of that
burden is because we simply did not perform the
function in the past and the American people
know it, they are holding us accountable for
that. I wonder if you could for the record,
however, just give us a sense of your own
personal burden, which worries me, both about
the Director of the CIA and the Director of the FBI.
How much of your personal time, since you have
assumed office, dog you think you have devoted
to preparing for, giving testimony before
Congressional Committees, and then following up
on the testimony that has been given, cr looking
at the testimony being given by others?

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 213



ory

MR. KELLEY: I Ws say that about 25 pero of my time
is consumed in going over testimony, reviewing
Material, acquainting myself with the progress
of the various committee activities, in pre-
paring myself for testimony, and in testifying;
and I think that the others in the top echelon
of the Bureau who are involved in this type of
thing may have even more than this devoted in
their time. It has increased my work day
considerably, and I find myself many times
reading until the wee hours of the morning.
I am not complaining about it. I assumed this.
Much more time is devoted to doing my job
now than ever before, again, about 25 percent
of that time is in this area.

SENATOR: Mr. Chairman, my time is up. Are we going for

\
one more round of questions?

MR. CHAIRMAN: If there are more questions.

SENATOR: I have just a few left. I would like an
answer to how much time you think is appro-
priate for you to spend on this activity,

I will wait until we come back.

QUESTIONS NOW FROM SENATOR BROCK

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Would you clarify for
me something you said earlier. With regard to the
oversight function, I thought that you said that the
oversight should include ail FBI activities. If that
is the case, you might be in some disagreement, with
those that say we should separate the oversight
of the domestic operations, primarily FBI, from
the international oversight function which
would more relate to CIA.

MR. KELLEY: 75 percent to 80 percent of our time is on criminal
activities. There is, on the other hand, a
gxeat interrelationship between our security
people and our criminal investigations. We may
have a case where we need additional
people in a security matter. We will call on
some people in the criminal activity section.

t is true, on the other hand, we will have
a big bank robbery or some big fugitive case.
We may call on security people and have them
do it. We have difficulty in setting aside

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 214
aE



|

tha@bortion of our budget whi @ goes solely
to the so-called intelligence activities. in
the area of intelligence, we have quite a bit
of work in the intelligence field in the
criminal work. We would suggest that it not
be fragmented, and would hope that we could
present all of our difficulties to one committee.
I realize that there is the thought that this
thrust should be just toward security matters
foreign and domestic. We have problems other
than this. I can see where it would be very
helpful to us to have an overall oversight
which would take care of both of our branches

QUESTION: The reason I asked the question, there has
been at least some indication among members
of the Senate, that they would like--at least some
members would like--to separate the intelligence
from the criminal aspect, and give the oversight
committee which this committee might create,
jurisdiction over all intelligence, counterintelligence,
domestically and international intelligence but to
leave to the Judicial Committee, the principal
oversight responsibility for the FBI. I gather
that you would not find that a very happy end product?

MR. KELLEY: We report to the Appropriations Committee, and
they outline our programs. Under this possibility
we would be reporting to an Intelligence

7 Committee, we would be reporting to the Senate
Judiciary Committee on general oversight.
Right away we have three within the Senate.

QUESTION: If we did give this committee full and complete
jurisdiction, would you also suggest that they
have jurisdiction in terms of appropriations
as well? In other words, you would limit the
oversight to one committee. It would have
both authorization oversight and appropriatien
authority.

MR. KELLEY: Senator, I am not really prepared to give you
an opinion on that. I would say that probably
this should be reserved to the Attorney General.
Personally, of course, it would probably give
us a closer definition of oversight and might
be that such a committee certainly could
become best acquainted with our work in ongoing
programs, but I do nat know that I can answer
well that particular question.

QUESTION:

MR.

KELLEY:

| :
I x sure that we can citnh® As a matter of
fact, there are some of us that feel that rather
than trying to define this thing too precisely,
we should create an oversight committee and
assign to them the responsibility'of a study

of the extent of the jurisdictional question.
That may be the best thing that we can

achieve at the moment if we are going to get

any response. Let me ask you one or

two more questions, again in this same area,

I am reluctant to limit the right of an Over-
sight Committee in terms of access. I think
that is almost something that we can do by
experience, as we have with the Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy. There the experience has
proven to be good, and I think, healthy for both
sides, Executive and Legislative: I am distressed
by the leak of information that is ongoing now.

I think it is extremely dangerous yet I

fine it difficult to find a way in which we
would limit an oversight committee which may
need some access in order to reach this
definition of responsibility. I do not

know how we would do what you are suggesting,
essentially depends upon the Director and
his testimony before the Committee.

Under our recommendations, we conclude that there
should be investigations and clearances granted to
members of staff, that their numbers, as well as
others for the Committee, should be as limited

as possible. We feel that matters that might
compromise our sources of information are those

that are most important. I think, Senator,

that probably we could start off in such a rela-
tionship being a little extended insofar as

our own desires, we can be a little more

open, and see how it works. I would hope that

it would be sort of an open-end type of thing so that
we cah get some history of experiences. [I

do not want to foreclose the right of review in this
regard. I think, as a citizen, I am compelled to
say that there should be a better flow of infor-
mation than has been true in the past. I am
willing to at least explore such a possibility.

-10-

DocId:32989503 Page 216



QUESTION: That is really what I am reaching for, and I
appreciate it. We are treating this as if it is
going to be de novo every six months. It is not.
You are going to create an expertise in this
Committee and its staff a knowledge of the general
problem area, and I think these matters will begin

to settle up as it gains maturity and experience.

Bat Z am reluctant to eliminate it now because I think

we may create an adversary relationship which I do

not think is helpful, where, as an alternative, if
we kept it fairly open, I think a development of that
experience would lead to a good relationship, as we
have done with the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy
earlier.

MR. KELLEY: There are misunderstandings about why we
think things are confidential. Take for
example, a small thing, a release of our telephone
directory. It is not generally understood that,
by virtue of the release of the telephone directory,
you therefore list the identity of our Agents.
They are listed in the telephone book. There-
after, they get a lot of crank calls. I
mever did release my address, and as soon as
it was listed--and it was listed of course in
the Congressional Record--I am not complaining
about this--I started receiving crank mail
at my home and some of it was on post cards,
some of it my wif& read, it wes not the
best thing. People do not realize that we
try to protect it fox reasons that we could
possibly explain in an atmosphere of cooperation
with such a committee, and I would look forward to
that opportunity. We have not communicated
properly, possibly. {ff it is determined this is
too far fetched, all right, we will drop it. We' are
willing to discuss it.

QUESTION: Thank you. My time has expired. I think what I am
saying is that there is a clear distinction between
@ one-shot investigatory committee which is trying
to get short-term information and a continuing over-
sight committee with a developed relationship on a
Maturing basis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Senator Weicker, while it is your turn, since

Senator Perey has used up his time, he has
requested a few more minutes, if you would yield
to him.

WEICKER: I yield.

QUESTIONS NOW FRCH SENATOR PERCY _

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

Regretfully, I have a witness upstairs in the

Foreign Relations Committee. I was anxious to

follow up, Mr. Kelley, what proportion of your

time do you think is appropriate and proper that

you should devote to Congressional oversight? In
other words, we have the same objective to reduce

the burden on your Department because of the
duplicative activities of the proliferated committees.
What proportion do you think is appropriate for you
to spend?

I have never really considered it, but I would
say that during my ordinary, everyday operations,
I should keep this in mind and should review
each program with the thought prepared to
discuss it with an oversight committee, maybe

5 percent, just a ballpark figure.

That is a goal I am not sure we will ever

achieve but certainly if we can cut if in half,

it will help, because your principal duty

obviously is to administer a very able department

and agency. The “thought has been orbited--I threw

it out originally--to just try to cut in half

in area of intelligence because of the tremen-

dous amount of knowledge a person has to gain to
properly authorize in authorizing legislation, and
yet the law--and we are not specialists in this field;
we are dealing with specialists in the law enforcement
field-~to cut it in half to see if possibly we can
consider in this one oversight committee, giving that
comaittee both authorization and appropriations
authority so the service would only have to go before
one committee in the Senate and one in the House and
have his job done with and thoroughly inform, say,

a group of nine Senators that would rotate in that
position. Would that, in your judgement, be of
material assistance and help if we could work it out
internally?

If we could, Senator, in one committee, I feel this
would be advantageous.

I have long proposed that the Attorney General he
taken out of politics and not be permitted by
procedure or precedent, just as the Secretary of
Defense, Secretary of State, has not participated
in politics as such. The Attorney General has

-12-

DocId:32989503 Page 218



a7 politically oriented of MMe, many times
being the campaign manager. Do you feel that
the Director cf the FBI is not a political
position and it should never be permitted~-do you
think it would be a good idea for the Attorney
General not to engage in party politics while he
is holding that office?

MR. KELLEY: I have never had experience with it
since I have come here, in any dealings with
me or with the Bureau by the three Attorneys
General under whom I have worked. There has been
no indication of political influence.

QUESTION: Do you suggest consolidation of Congressional
oversight of the FBI. Should that be done by
the seme committee overseeing agencies dealing

_ with foreign intelligence in your judgment?
é

MR. KELLEY: In my judgment, all of the operations of the FBI

would advantageously be joined in one committee.

QUESTION: One committee?
MR. KELLEY: Yes, sir.

QUESTION: Could you explain in layman's term the difference
between foreign and domestic intelligence in
criminal cases as managed administratively by
the FBI? And I ask that with the understanding
that criminal activities involving foreign powers
are not necessarily handled in the FBI's foreign
intelligence division. For example, if another
country were to finance terrorist acts within
the United States, the entire case might be
handled in the Criminal Division. Therefore, it
would help us in our understanding if you could
differentiate between what activities are handled
by each of those bureaus. If you would like to
do that for the record, to make it more complete.
I would certainiy accept that.

MR. KELLEY: I would prefer to prepare this in a response to you
and will do so.

QUESTION: Mr. Kelley, finally, FBI activities seem to be at
the heart of one of the gray areas of oversight.
I think we are in general agreement that Congress
should create a committee that would oversee the
CIA and NSA. What aspects of the FBI that should
be looked at by this committee is another matter.
What are your views on this?

MR. KELLEY: Could I also give you that response~-~may I respond

to that in writing also?

SENATOR:

ves Qou certainly may. I chi Denat that winds
up. I wouid simply like to say having known
Attorney General Levi for a quarter of a century

as a trustee at the University of Chicago, I

think the tone and attitude that he is establishing,
the relationship that he has established with you
and which has been a cause of great concern between
the FBI Directors of the past have not been fully
satisfactory and fully cooperative.

I think that relationship that has been estab-
lished has been an outstanding accomplishment,

and I think your testimony to that effect here

is very important indeed, and I certainly -

commend both you and Attorney General Levi, because
a great deal has been accomplished already.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Senator Weicker?

SENATOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

QUESTIONS NOW FROM SENATOR WETLCKER

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

DocId: 32989503

I notice in your statement you make mention

of the fact that since 1975, or April through
December, 1975, a great amount of time, effort,

and money was expended on responding to
Gongressionai inquiries, et cetera. I think we
both might also allude to the fact that that

is directly attributable to the fact that ere

was no Congressional inguiry for many years before
that, and what in effect you have seen is an extreme
reaction to an extreme situation. As a matter of
fact, as I understand it, and prior to the impeach-
ment inquiry neither the House nor the Senate Sudiciary
Committees held any hearings on FBI oversight. is

that correct, to your knowledge?

I do not recail this, Senator.

Z believe that was before your timé, but that is
the record,

i am thinking only during the time that I have

been here. I do not recall just when we first
reported te the Oversight Committee. It was

during the time that Mr. Saxbe was Attorney General.
We appeared three times. Prior to that I do not
know.

- 14 -

Page 220



° QUESTION: I ti@Mk it is important to poi Pout that I am

sure the American people are just as appalled

about your being overburdened with Congressional
inquiries as they are with no Congressional
inquiries. But that is the record. There is nothing
in between. I think that is important to point

out as we try to devise some system, some apparatus,
to bring balance to all this. We need the FBI. As
I said the other day, we need a CIA. There is no
reason why a choice has to be made between 0 and 100
percent insofar as it is using up your time,

the CIA or any of our law enforcement agencies.
My concern, believe me, Director, is not that

you are going to be overburdened with oversight.

As I have indicated, unless this Congress acts
- very shortly, the whole thing is going to be
: forgotten and we are going to go back to zero
again. That is a far greater danger in my

book than your being overburdened. I would

suggest to you, it is very strange to say, that

I would hope that you, along with Mr. Colby and
others in the law enforcement community, would
fight very hard te see this oversight legislation
implemented, because on that depends the survival
of your agency, on that depends a restoration of
“confidence as far as the American people are
concerned in the law enforcement and intelligence
agencies. I fear the bureaucratic footdragging

is going to go on around here two years, five

years from now. We will be right back at square

A, except the next time that any other abuses

get uncovered, that is going to be the end of

your agency. There is going to be no way of coming
back in the room to construct something that

makes. sense. That is my concern.

MR. KELLEY: I went on record during my confirmation sponsoring
oversight, and I still feel that it is a very viable
and proper precedure. I have no objection to it
whatsoever, and I welcome it.

QUESTION: I notice you say you favor a new oversight
committee. Is it your feeling that the present
oversight mechanisms are not adequate?

MR. KELLEY: I hope I have not indicated that I am critical of
the present oversight. I hope that we can have
a centralized oversight whereby our intelligence
and our criminal investigatory responsibilities
are bést included in this one. Under the projected
possibilities, the Bureau would be fragmented,
we would have an oversight of the security
of the national cownterintelligence field and

~ 15 -

| NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 221



the@ininar field maintained the present

‘ce oversight system. I would hope that it would

be together. We do report to the Appropriations
Committee and we do report to the Judiciary
Committee on Oversight. If it were fragmented
further, we would have three oversight committees.

QUESTION: Do you feel that the present system of oversight
as embodied in the House and Senate Judiciary
Committees should be supplanted by a new Oversight
Committee, or are you satisfied with the present
system?

MR. KELLEY: I would reserve the final determination to
consultation as I would want to do, of course,
with Mr. Levi to get together and do this. I
would say, primarily, our goal is to have
it centered not in any particular committee.
I think that is the responsibility of Congress, actually.
What we want to do is not fragment it, not
proliferate it, but to have it so that we can
have one group to which we can go for considera-
tion of our problems and outline our procedures.

QUESTION: I can appreciate, Mr, Director, that
you still have to work with the Senate and House
Judiciary Committees and obviously we don't
want to ruffle any feathers. We want to
plot a future course. We are not trying to
find out how we can live with the past. The
difficulty is, as I perceive it, not that the
mechanism was not there for oversight--it was
there. The problem was that it was a secondary
function of the particular committee, in this
case the Judiciary Committee, something
down the line. Do you feel that your agency and its
activities are of sufficient importance that
that should be a full-time job, rather than a
secondary job, for a Congressional committee?

MR. KELLEY: I responded to a question asked by Senator
Perey about how much time I thought I might ke
devoting to the oversight requirement. I
thought about 5 percent. That is just a
ballpark figure. I do not think that that would
necessarily mean that one committee would
be set aside for just that type of deliberation.
I think that if it were to include all of our
activities, criminal as well as security, that it
might take a little more, but still, I do not
think that things come up that frequently
where it would be a real heavy task for any
committee.

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

QUESTION:

DocId: 32989503

You [eer what we are cont@iating here

would be a committee whose intefition would

be directed toward the FBI, the CIA, the law
enforcement intelligence community? It

would not just be the FBI; it would also be the CIA.
What I am saying, I think what others are trying

to get across is, is this sufficiently important

to this Nation, to its life and to its Constitution,
that that is a full-time job and not a secondary

job for scme other Committee, be it the FBI which

is a secondary function cf Judiciary, or the CIA,
which is a secondary function of Armed Services.
This is a primary function. At least, I do not

find it a primary function of law enforcement
intelligence. That is why my question to you, whether
you are satisfied with the present system, which
obviously has not worked in the past, with a warning
could work, or whether we are best just having one
committee that would work with these law enforcement
intelligence agencies and start from-scratch and once
again try to rebuild confidence.

It really does not make any difference what you think
or what I think or what Senator Ribicoff thinks or
our colleagues here think. The fact is that the
American people have lost their confidence. ‘That is
the group we have to reach. Whether I am satisfied
that you are a fine man with great integrity

and a fine Director, it does not mean anything,

and your opinion of me, that is not important.

What the American people think is what is very
important. That is what is jeopardizing your

Agency now and, indeed, the Congress.

I would construe anything which is developed

by Congress as something which we would certainly
try to work under. We will not complain.

You will not have any beefs from uS. I told
Senator Brock that I would certainly work as best
we can with the system that is devised. I repeat
that to you, too. I am not going to argue about
it. I would like to work with you just as closely
as we can.

I appreciate it. I am not trying to lay all of
this at your doorstep. I think Senators Brock

and Ribicoff were talking earlier, we were talking
earlier, I was talking earlier with Senator Brock,
we are going to try to pry these things loose

in @ Congress. They are the @: that do

not want any change. That is why I am trying to
get all the help we can publicly. Please
understand what I think all of us here are
saying. We are not against your agency. We
want to see it survive, but it cannot survive
unless the American people feel that they

have a handle on this policy. Thank you.

MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you very much. Senator Nunn?

SENATOR: I have no questions.
CHAIRMAN: Senator Brock, do you have any more questions?
SENATOR: No.

\ CHAIRMAN : Thank you very much, Mr. Kelley. It may
« very will be, as we proceed to mark up this
an legislation, that we may have occasion to talk
to you and your staff. I would hope that you
would be available to us in the future.

MR. KELLEY: We will be available.

fiom Pr oe :

Without carefully looking over the de- -

tails, Americans cannot finally sudge the
considerable reforms announced by
President Ford Tuesday night for re-
vamping the troubled’ Centra! Intelli-
geace Agency. But in concept and struc-
ture, the President has responded con-
structively both to legitimate concerns of
the American public and to several
major findings of recent, separate offi-
cial investigations.

In its interim report last November,
the select Senate intelligence committée
appropriately condemned assassination
as a policy tool and-decried the ambigui-
ty, the blurred links of responsibility, in
the decision-making chain of command
within the intelligence community.

Certainly responsive to all these’con-
cerns is the President’s plan to create
separate executive boards — one to
make broad intelligence policy and the
gther, under CIA director George Bush,
to manage that policy — with distinct
functions and clear accountability to an
elected President. Also, the President

zvules out assassination of foreign heads
of state as a policy, at least in peace-
time. Most Americans couldn’t agree
more with that.
eee, OK OK Ok

Last June, another CIA investigating
committee, this one headed by Vice
President Rockefeller, criticized the lack
of effective oversight of CIA activities by

both Congress and the executive branch. .

Mt suggested @ joint congressional over-
sight committee and said ‘a new body is
needed te provide oversight of the agen-
cy within the executive branch.” Now
the President has emphatically endorsed
both ideas. On the joint oversight panei

in Congress, he recognizes that this is a~

decision for Congress to make. But 19
provide oversight within the executive’
branch, he -hag named his own special

independert pane! of three citizens to -

oversee all intelligence operations and
report directly to him. We hope that
board will receive strong powers ai
baching-to do its job, whig!

narily important because of the neces-
sary secrecy of the work it is overseeing.

Also welcome is the President’s plan
for public guidelines, for beth CIA and
FBI, and for stringent controls to protect.
citizen liberties against such past abuses
as secret mail openings and electronic
surveillance. Especially reassuring is the
idea of requiring judicial warrants be-
fore such surveillance, even for national
security reasons, is undertaken.

We will be interested in details of
many of these changes, especially con-
cerning the agency guidelines and Ford
proposals to Congress for making disclo-
sure of information a crime, 2 sensitive
area that must be scrupulously limited 7
a free society. ~ 7

ee tte

As the President and the Rockefeller
panel have rightly said, the object must
be the difficuit one of maintaining an
effective intelligence capability while
simultaneously protecting the liberties of
individuals and democratic safeguards in
an open, free society. This isn’t easy, but
it must involve clearly pinpointed dc-
countability. The public should not know
the details of-covert intelligence opera-

tions abroad. But it must know what offi- .

cials are responsible, and therefore pub-

licty accountable, for the management.

and policies influencing those operations.
This principle is impressively imbedded
in the Ford plan of a policy-mal body,
a management body, a still-to-be-issued
set of public guidelines and a new over-
sight unit — ali diregtly Tesponsi ible to an
elected President,

But these proposals compose only
part of the solution to past mistakes. In
our check-and-balance system, Congress
must debate and decide how to organize
its own vital oversight role most effec-
tively, After months of probing, Wash-
ington needs to act — thoughtfully, but
decisively — on its information. The
President has now wisely and compre-
hersively mad: his own move from
investigations to conclusions and actions.

Congress should not lag far behind:—o 7

an “unrealistic” list of more

« A Justice Dept. spokesman
Said on Tuescay that the so-

ence and had been “pared down
cousiaerably” to about 1,200
names by the time it was dis-

Intelligence Reports-Evade Real Issue—

It is essential to its national interest
that the United States maintain an in-
*telligence and counterintelligence capa-
bility, including a-covert one.

: * The requirements of democracy tend
“o conflict with the need for secrecy.
Thus the Senate’ Select Committee on’
7 ntelligence Activities, which recently
sued voluminous reports on foreign,

“military and domestic intelligence, has -
‘properly recommended that “secret ace *
- tions should be consistent with publicly ~

defined forcign- “policy goals and “should
-be reserved for extraordinary eircum-
lances when no other means will suf-
ice”?

We agree, too, with the committee's
“gecognition that oversight of the coun-

try’s intelligence functions by the execu-.

tive branch and by Congress has been
-historically weak, and with the recom-
:mendation for tighter supervision. .

mittee nor its House counterpart (whose
investigative report has yet to be pub-
licized) has as yet come to grips with
the real problem: The violation of laws

and the subsequent coveruns. Despite -

all the intelligence-agency abuses docu-

“mented by the Senate panel, including

violation of Americans’ constitutional
rights via break-ins, illegal surveillance
and harassment of individuals and
groups, and drug tesls on unsuspecting
persons, the Justice Department has not
made a single move to prosecute the
violators, There is no place within our
legal structure for the kind of crimes
that have been committed and which
have gone unpunished.

The congressional oversight role

could best be served by a single perma-
nent committee, but it nceds to be one
endowed with broad legislative and

WHAT SEEMS TO BE at the bottom, of this”
congressional and presidential lethargy is an unex-
pressed contempt for the Constitution and the law:
because it is sometimes inconvenient to observe them.

One would have thought, for instance, that “executive
privilege” would have been thoroughly discredited after
ex-President Nixon’s abuse of it. Yet President Ford has
been invoking it again and this pernicious doctrine —
which has neither constitutional nor legal foundation —
seems to be accepted by Congress, the President, and
even (with qualifications) by the courts. There seems to
be a consensus in Washington that the convenience of
“executive privilege” is more important than law or
Constitution. 1 .

In similar fashion, Congress and the President seem

* willing tc overlook the transgressions of the CIA and the
FBI because it is convenient to let them do as they
* please.

It is convenient, in other words, to let official

lawlessness flourish.
~There-is reason to be glum this Law Day. “

Biack Panthers

-, WASHINGTON, May 6 — The FBI provoked and
encouraged ploodly gang warfare between the Black

Panthers and rival groups

in hopes of neutralizing the

organizations or killing off the leadership, a Senate
Intelligence Committee staff report said today.

. At least four gang-style kill-
ings in California in 1969 were
Yinked to FBI provocation, and
‘the bureau targeted the prem-
ises of a Chicago Black Pan-
ther apartment Yor a local po-

lice raid in which two died in a,

gun battle the same year, the
report said,

The supplemental report,
prepared by the staff of the
Senate Intelligence Committee,
was titled “The FBI’s Covert
Action Program to Destroy the
Black Panther Party.” It cata-
Jogued FBI tactics renging
from anonymous hate letters
and scurrilous propaganda to
fingering black leaders for kill-
ing by one side or the other.

Snfornation on the FBI
“marking” the Chicago apart-
ment where two Black Pant
leaders were killed during a
raid apparently was not for-
warded at the time to the
Chicago district attorney inves-
tigating the FBI’s roie in the
‘operation.

es
THEN DIRECTOR J. Edgar
Hoover decided in September
1988, the report suid, that the
Black Paniler pacty consti«
tuted “the greatest threat to
the internal security of the
country.” By the foiloviing year
the party was “the primary
focus” for 233 of 295 actions
against “black nationalists.”
‘The report said the FBI used

staff member who compiled the
report, told reporters that

groups “clearly were aimed at

them busy fighting each:

In another report, the com-
miittée Staff said high officials
in the Kennedy and Jchnson !

administrations must share the -

blame for the FBI's campaign
to destroy Dr. Martin Luther
King.

It said there was no evidence
that anyone outside the FBI ap-
proved the campaign against
Dr. King, but it concluded that
“officials responsible for super-
vising the FBI received indica-
tions that such an effort ...
might be taking place and fail-
ed to take adequate steps to
prevent it.”

eee

THE REPORT said evidence

showed that:
- Atty. Gen. Robert F.
Kennedy was given a summary
of information obtained from
bugs placed in Dr. King’s hotet
rooms;

‘Satty-Gen. Nicholas DeB.
Katzenbach and Asst. Atty.
Gen. Burke Marshall told
President Johnson that the FBI
had offered to play tape record-
ings of the bugs to reporters;

—The FBI offered to play the
tape recordings for Johnson
aide Walter Jenkins; and
—Johnson aide’ Bill Moyers
‘approved sending FBI reports
containing derogatory personal
information about Dr. King to
other government agencies.

“The evidence reveals a dis-
turbing attitude of unconcern
by responsible officials and a
failure on their part to make
appropriate corrective meas-
ures,” the report sai

eo

THE 105-PAGE STUDY,
which contained few new dis-
closures concerning the bu-

described campaign
discredit Dr.
King as the leader of the Negro
people,” said the FBI tried to
smear Dr. King even after his
death, treating him much like
a Soviet agent, and had a plan
-foritarasé his widow-as wel.

iNw 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 251

“The FBI's attempts to djs- -

credit Dr. King did not end
‘ith his death” by assassina-
tion in 1968, the staff said. In
what it calls the FBI’s “secret
war’’ against American
citizens,

‘The staff also said, however,
it found no evidence the bureau
was involved in Dr. King’s
murder. A Justice Department
task force is investigating that
subject separately,

carat

BUT THE REPORT, pre-
pared by the staff and not sign-
ed by committee members,
said the FBI under Mr. Hoover
pursued a “vicious vendetta’
against Dr. King from 1963
until some time after his death,
trying to discrédit his memory
and to stop Congress from
making his birthday a national
holiday.

Tt said William Sullivan, Mr.
Hoover's former FBI deputy,
described the over-all cam-
paign against Dr, King and
thousands of other suspected
radicals as “a rough, tough,
dirty business and dangerous

'No holds were barred,” Mr.
Sullivan testified at committee
hearings. “We have used (simi-
Jar) techniques against Soviet
agents ... We did not
differentiate.”

eo 8

REPEATING CONCLU-
sions the committee has pub-
lished, the report said Mr.
Hoover considered Dr. King
“no good” and a dangerous
force for dissent in America.

It said he directed his agents
to prove Dr. King was
Communist-influenced by tap-

{pings telephones, bugging

otel zooms and.haxassing
him, One ploy was the anony-

. mous letter, already publicized,

which suggested that Dr. King
commit suicide or face disclo-
sure of an extra-marital affair.

But Wednesday's report also
included new disclosures about
‘the smear campaign that fol-
Towed Dr. King’s death.

When Congress was consider-
ing declaring his birthday a na-
tional holiday, it said, the
FBI’s Crime Records Division
“recomended briefing con-
gressmen” who might keep the
bill bottled up in committee if
“they realize King was a
scoundrel.”

Congress has yet to eee
King birthday bill.

‘fhe report also said the FBI
Atlanta field office proposed a
“counterintelligence operation”
against Dr. King’s memory and
his widow in April

Tax Report Ci

Courter-Express Washington Bureats

WASHINGTON ~ Former
Buffaionian Roger Barth is
named in a new staff report of
the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee deti if abuses of tax

information by the FBI, CIA -

and other executive agencies.

Barth was assistant to former
Internal Revenue Commissioner
Rancolph Thrower carly in
1559 when the White House
reportedly encouraged the IRS
to examine leftwing tax-exempt
organizations to be sure they
were complying with the tax
Jaws oo

‘The staff report, drawing
almost entirely on prior con-
gressional enquiries, depicts
Barth as the contact person at
IRS for White House aide Tom
Cha .es Huston who recom
mended the special audit of ac-
tivist groups.

White House ‘Conduit?

‘The staff study said career
TRS employees who were ques-
tioned “unanimously named
Mr. Barth as a conduit to the
White House of information
about the inner workings of the
IRS.”

But it also quotes Huston as
saying he had “no discussion”
with Barth regarding the es-
tablishment of a secret “Special
Service Staff” (SSS) which
evolved within IRS in June 1969.

It was this organization which
subsscuently targeted some

NW 54965 DocId:32989503

&
8.00 individuals and 3,000
groups of activists and ex-
tremists for special {ax audits.
‘The SSS was abolished three
years ago by the present com-
missioner, Donald Alexander.
“There is no evidence that

the White House ordered or ‘

specifically sugzested its es-
tablishment,” the staff study
said, “The evidence does sug-
gest, however, thal because SSS
was in part a response to White
House interest in the IRS’ act-
ing against ideological or-
ganizations, the White House
was kept advised of the specific
action IRS was taking and that
there was some feeling within
IRS that the service had made
a “commitment” to the White
House to proceed with SSS.”

According to the report,
President Richard Nixon
“reportedly concurred” with
Huston’s proposal early in 1969
to take a close look at left-wing
-groups by examining their tax
filings.

Dr. Arthur Burns, who now
heads the Federal Reserve
Board, was asked to speak with
IRS Commissioner Thrower
about the President's “‘con-
cera” and the two met on June
16," 1969,

+ Four days later, the report
says, Huston advised Barth by
memorandum that the “Presi-
dent is anxious to see some
positive action taken against
these orgailizatiins*which are

Page 258

violating existing regulations
and I have assured him that I
will keep him advised of the
efforts that are presently
underway.”

“Cannot Recall’

According to the Joint Con-
gressional Committee on
Ineraal Revenue Taxation,
Barth may have shown this
memo to tie commissioner and
ta an assistant commissioner
but “Mr. Barth canmot recall

ing either for certain.”

The staff study says a report
on ideological organizations was
prepared for Barth following a
meeting on July 1, 1969 at which
IRS staff members were briefed
on “militant organizations” by
a special agent, E: D.
Hughes.

‘The report says Huston stated
that he believed he had seen the
memorandum and that “Mr.
Barth had sent it to him.” ;

The staff study tells’ of an
early meeting of the organizers
of the SSS on July 24, 1969 but
does not mention Barth as
among those attending.

Donald Virdin, who took the

minutes of that meeting, wrote
a memorandum July 31, saying
that a copy of the minutes was
forwarded to Barth. It quoted
Bernard Meehan, an IRS aide,
as saying the minutes “are over
at the White House.”

Barth left the IRS in 1973 and
is in private law practice in
Washington. Saaanaaanae

TD-350 (Rev. 11-11-75) : @

(Mount Clipping in Space Below)

C¥itinals in FBI

The FBI was originally supposed to catch criminals.

Instead, the agency spent a lot of its time in the 1960s
performing criminal acts.

The revelations that are coming from the Senate
Intelligence Committee's investigation of the FBI’s
activities in behalf of ‘national security” are disturbing
for two reasons: first, because they make explicit the
FBI’s criminal activities which had previously been
only generally known; and second, because there is no
evidence that any agents or superior officers in the F381
have been or will be prosecuted for these criminal acts.
ny We believe those responsible for such FBI projects as
the attempt to defame the late Rev. Martin Luther King
should be prosecuted. The atterapt apparently went
beyond harrassment and snooping to active defamation
of character. Similarly, those responsible for other
criminai ‘acts (inciting to violence in the FBI’s cam-
paign against the Black Panther Party; apparently
illegal methods used in the campaign against the U.S.
Labor Party) should be prosecuted. It’s bad enough that
criminal acts were apparently ordered or permitted;
what makes it even more reprehensible is that most of
them seem to have been directed against citizens who
were guilty of nothing except the ‘‘crime’’ of offending
the'patriotic sensibilities of then FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover and his chief assistants.

arenes

PUNISHING THE GUILTY isn’t enough. Something
must be done to prevent such illegal and un-
constitutional invasion of citizens’ rights in the future,
«This means, primarily, that the President and
Congress must accept more responsibility for the
conduct of the FBI and other police and intelligence
agencies, Neither party wants to do this now. It has been
convenient for Presidents and Congresses to remain
ignorani of what the FBI, the CIA, and others were up
to. Now that we all know what they were up to, we also

ete?

know that Presidents and Congresses behaved

irresponsibly by remaining willfully ignorant.

Congress has got to set up a committee to oversee the
behavior-of the FBI and the others. That will mean the
President will have to take care to keep himself better
informed and to see io it that intelligence activities are
legal and constitutional, or else face censure by
Congress,

If they don’t take on this responsibility, there will,

surely se more iflegelity and unconstitutionality ia the
feture \

As tired as most Americans are of re-
peated disclosures of official lawbreak-
ing by federal intelligence agencies, the
final report of the Senate Select Commit-
tee on Intelligence Activities is still a
shocker. It starkly portrays wholesale
illegal acts against citizens here at home
over the past 40 years by such federal
agencies as the FBI, the CIA and the IRS.
under the administrations of the six
Presidents from FDR to Nixon.

These agencies were used to harass
.individuals. They were used to try to
break up marriages. They tried to ostra~
|eize people from their professions. They
:compiled hundreds of thousands of dos-
siers. They opened and photographed
1250.00 first-class letters, They sought to
provoke dissension and rivalries that
could even result in death. And they
sometimes did these things merely be-
cause someone in power disliked the po-
litical views or the personalities of the
targeted victims,

““Knyone who could not feel revulsion
at the attitude of mind reflected by the

ideals of individual liberty and limited
government. That attitude is summed up
in the report’s quotation of William Sul-
livan,. former assistant FBI director:

“The one thing we were concerned
about was this: Will this course of action
work, will it get us what we want?... As
far as legality is concerned, morals or
ethics, (it) was never raised by myself or
anybody else ... I think this suggests

really in government that we are
ae alae

amoral.”*

That, too often, was your FBI in ac-
tion —'and also, apparently, your IRS
and CIA. But now it’s time, and past
time, for a change. The Senate Commit-
tee suggests several refurms. But the
single most important one is to write this
clear-cut principle into law: :

“There is no inherent constitutional au-
thority for any intelligence agency to
violate the law.

If this is the government-of-laws-not-
men that the Founding Fathers intended,
then no future agent of the government
should be in doubt that the law applies to
him as much as to any private citizen.

FBT Spy Net Poses Peril
To Society, Report Says

United Press International

WASHINGTON, May 7 — The
FBI calis them “intelligence in-
formants,” a more elegant
erm for what the general pub-
lic knows crudely as squealers,
-finks or stoolpigeons.

The murky world of the
professional intelligence in-
formant was penetrated for the
first time in detail Thursday in
a Senate Intelligence Commit-
tee staff report which said the
FBI had more than 1500 under-
cover spies on a $7.4 million
payroll as of last year.

It warned that the mass of
information on the lives and ac-
tivities of targeted individuals
and groups and the methods
used pose “dangers to a free
society” and said FDI guide-
lines should be clarified and
istrengthened.

PREPARED BY the staff of
he committee which is now
completing documentation of
its 15-month investigation of
intelligence agencies, the ‘re-
port expressed alarm at “the
extremely broad scope of Fal
intelligence informant surveil-
lance ana reporsing.”

“The dangers to a free soci-
ety that are implicit in the use
of secret intelligence inform
have long been recognized.” it

id. “The intelligence inform-
int technique is not a precise
{nstrument. By its very nature,
it risks governmental menitar-

Docld:32989503 Page 263° -

ing of constitutionally protected
activity and the private lives of
Americans.”

Informants have infiltrated
or reported on — among others
— the Black Panthers, the Ku
Klux Klan, anti-war organiza-
tions, college campuses and
even the women’s liberation
movement, the report said.

Any and all information is
welcomed, from personal and
political views of “targets”’ to
their finances and sex lives.

rane)

“IN FACT, intelligence in-
formants report on virtually
every aspect of a group’s ac-
tivities serving, in the words of
both FBI officials and an in-
formant, as a ‘vacuum cleaner’
of information,” the repart
said.

According to records given
the committee, ‘as of June 30,
1975, the EBI had 1584 infor
ants, of whom 1040 were regu-
lar spies and 554 were on
“probation status” pending
establishment of their
reliability.

There also were 649 ‘‘confi-

dential sources” and 200 “panel

sources,” it said — individuals
who furnish information avali-
able to them in their positions
in the political or business life
vot the community, or who
twould attend certain events in
‘prder to report on them ty, the |

hundreds of

break-ins, “‘

— The FBI has conducted
‘despite the questionable

legality of the technique and its deep intrusion into
the privacy of targeted individuals,” a Senate Intel-
ligence Committee staff report says. 7

The break-ins, officially
known as “surrept
entries,” were conducted for
the purpose of photographing
ox seizing documents and in-

falling bugs, according to the
report released today.

The report is one of a.

series prepared by the intelli-
gence panels staff to back up
recommendations in the com-
mittee’s final report,

THE JUSTICE Department
scill permizs the bureau to con-
duct break-ins to install bugs
and refuses to rule out the pos-
sibility of. using unauthorized
entries or “black bag” jobs, to
obtain documents from foreign
intelligence targets, the I7-page
report noted,

“AMHOUBA several attorneys
general were aware of the FBI
practice of break-ins to inétall
electronic listening devices,
there is no indication that the
FBU informed any attorney
general about its use of black
bag jobs,” the report said.

An FBI memo cited in the re- +.

port stated that “we do not ob-
tain euthorization for black hag |
jobs from outside the bureau. *
Such a technique involves tres-
passing and is clearly illegol.””*

Stee teat

THE FBI was unatis to pro--
vide the committee with a com-
plete accounting of the total
number of break-ins because
most records were destroyed
soon a‘ter an entry was accom-:
plished, the report said,

Figures provided by the FBI:
showed there were at least 242/
brea against suspected,
domestic subversives between
1842 and 198 and that since;
1990 the FBI conducted more}
than 500 break-ins to install .
bugs.

“Almost as many surrepti
tious entries were conducted in
tiem period against tarvels

report said.

For months now Americans have
been deluged with startling disclosures
of how various federal agencies have
pried into confidential records, tapped
telephones, traced mail and otherwise
rudely brushed aside personal liberties.
While the disclosures themselves have
been legion, however, new laws to pre-
vent their recurrence have not. A

That absence of corrective legislation
is a major reason why the so-called Bill
of Rights Procedures Act (H.R. 214),
now working its way slowly through the
committee system of the House of Repre-
sentatives, looks so beneficial.

Another reason is that it confronts the
problem—the acknowledged need to in-
vestigate possible criminal activities
while still protecting individual liberties
—in a sensible way.

The proposal, sponsored by Rep.
Charles Mosher (R., Ohio) and co-spon-
sored by several dozen House members

~ of both political parties,; would not
prohibit such investigative techniques as
mail covers and wiretaps. Rather, it
would require clear, uniform proce-
dures designed to provide convincing
justification for such surveillance,

To take one example, the tracing of
mail from sendér to receiver could be
justified only if one of three conditions
were established first: to locate a fugi-

tive; to investigate mail fraud; to inves-
peewee

net ~ {

tigate a felony offense. Strict recordss
would have to be kept, the authority to

proceed would be pinpointed in specified

officials and any authorization would

have to be renewed every 30 days.

Hence, mail covers could not, even when

authorized initially, go on and on unre-

viewed for years.

We are not legislators, of course, and
HLR. 214 may not be perfect. Aiso, it does
not cover investigations for national se-
curity reasons. This is an area of grave
abuse, too, but one in which another bill,”
proposed by the Ford administration and |
supported by séveral Democratic leaders
in Congress, would produce reforms.

But the Mosher bill is impressive in
its concept and its objectives, It has
undergone hearings and won approval
from a key House subcommittee. We
urge the House, and especially its mem-
bers from Western New York, to give
this measure, which has already won en-
dorsements from such diverse institu-
tions as the AFL-CIO and the National
Association of Mutual Savings Banks,
sympathetic attention.

The numerous revelations of govern-
ment snooping have made the case for
corrective legislation crystal clear. By
tightening and clarifying and standardi
ing procedures for federal agencies, thi
bill would suitably limit the reach of?:

The FBI provoked con

of Portland, Ore. The two are
charged in the June 26, 1975,

Today marks my first appearance before the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence. I want to assure you that
I sincerely welcome the opportunity to work with you.

I believe that we can and must develop a clear
base of understanding between the Executive and Legislative
Branches on the proper role of the FBI in the discharge of
its complex national security responsibilities.

As the Supreme Court so aptly observed in its
Keith Decision in 1972, “Unless Government safeguards its
own capacity to function and to preserve the security of its
people, society itself could become so disordered that all
rights and liberties would be endangered,"

Yet the maintenance of national security is a
*hollow victory unless it can be achieved with the least
possible intrusion into the rights and privacy of our citizens.
Balancing these imperatives will require the greatest study
and serious thought.

Together, I feel we can reach a meaningful understanding-
which will best serve our country.

Since I became Director in 1973, there has been a
continuous examination of all major aspects of the FBI's
operations. One such study, initiated in 1974, established
that a quality, rather than a caseload quantity, approach in
the aueienmant of our manpower and other Peeoaress would

produce better results.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 278


" @ t

Originally, this quality approach was tried on an
experimental basis in four of our 59 field divisions. It
proved so successful that we implemented it field-wide in 1975.

Today, the quality approach is being applied to all
areas of jurisdiction, including those in the foreign
intelligence and domestic security fields that are of prime
interest to this Committee.

In July, 1973, we had 21,414 domestic security cases.
By March 31, 1976, before the Attorney General's guidelines
took effect, we had--through application of the quality
approach--reduced this caseload to 4,868 investigative matters,
a 78 percent reduction. As of September 20, 1976, this figure
has been further reduced to 626. This includes investigations
of 78 organizations and 548 individuals.

This reduction has been made possible largely because
we have discontinued investigations of rank and file members.
We are confident that the FBI can meet its responsibilities
by focusing our investigations on the activities of organ-
izations and on individuals who are in a policy-making position
in those organizations or who have engaged in activities which
indicate they are likely to use force or violence in violation
of Federal law.

In effecting this reduction, we have kept these

vital principles in mind:

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 279


: @ @

First, there must he no sacrifice or compromise
of the essential security needs of the United States.
Second, there must be the least possible intrusion
on the rights and privacy of our citizens, including
their sacred right of legitimate dissent.
Third, although domestic security cases differ in
some respects from ordinary criminal investigations,
these cases should be tied as closely as possible to
actual or potential violations of Federal law. In
furtherance of this objective, last month I transferred
the supervision of all domestic security cases from our
Intelligence Division to our General Investigative
Division, which has responsibility over criminal matters.
In an effort to insure uniform adherence to the
guidelines and laws applicable to these and all other areas
of our jurisdiction, I have combined the Office of Planning
and Evaluation and the Inspection Division. In this new
Division I have created a Professional Responsibility Section.
It will report directly to me.

Ir have also expanded the role of the Legal Counsel
Division in reviewing all areas of FBI policies and operations.
Legal Counsel will report directly to me and to the Associate

Director.

NW 54965 DocId:32989503 Page 280


The investigations transferred include those
involving domestic organizations oriented toward violence
and individuals affiliated with such groups, as well as civil
unrest and demonstration matters and basic revolutionary
groups dedicated to the overthrow of the Government. The
General Investigative Division will also be responsible for
several categories of criminal investigations formerly
administered by the Intelligence Division. These are
bombing matters, sabotage, passport and visa violations,
and protection of foreign officials and official guests
of the United States.

The guidelines which the Attorney General issued
last March set forth standards and procedures for domestic
security investigations. But, the FBI regards these to be
minimum standards. FBI Headquarters has imposed stringent
criteria to insure we use our manpower resources in the most
productive manner.

There are a number of reasons why we have been able
to bring about a major reduction in our domestic security
caseload.

The decade of the 1960's was marked by protests,

often violent, on our Nation's streets and campuses.

-4-

DocId:32989503 Page 281



Nw 54965

We entered the 1970s still engaged in an undeclared
conflict in Vietnam which was unpopular with some segments
of our pooulation. Not in recent history had this country been
so divided over an issue, and this division was not limited
to rhetoric but included demonstrations that often erupted

into violence.

There were deliberate criminal acts, including
bombings and sabotage, by persons opposed to our involvement
in Vietnam. The role of the FBI in this confrontation was
clearly to thwart the efforts of those who resorted to

violence as an expression of their opposition.

With the cessation of the Vietnam War in early 1973,
a major cause for divisiveness in this country was eliminated, and

the potential for violence was lessened, but not eliminated.

The FBI began closing thousands of investigations
at that time as determinations were made that certain groups
and individuals no longer were engaged in activities that

were likely to involve violations of Federal law.

The FBI met the unusual challenges of the 1960s and
early 1970s. The Senate Select Committee has examined these

and other problems in the intelligence field which led

-5-

DocId: 32989503 Page 282



to the creation of this Oversight Committee; and as the
Committee is aware, the FBI fully cooperated in that review.

You have my absolute assurance that your Committee
will receive the same full cooperation in carrying out its
responsibilities under Senate Resolution 400.

One of the tasks confronting this Committee is the
formulation of a legislative charter defining the FBI's
jurisdiction in the domestic security and intelligence fields.
This will be a most precise and demanding undertaking.

As I remarked to Senator Church's Committee, the
legislative charter must be sufficiently flexible that it does
not stifle the FBI's effectiveness in combating the high
incidence of crime and violence across the United States.

The charter must clearly address the demonstrated problems

of the past; yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times
change and so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal
and subversive challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has
undertaken the formulation of operational guidelines governing
this-area of our activities does not in any manner diminish
the need for legislation. The responsibility for conferring

jurisdiction resides with the Congress.

caseload.

The decade of the 1960's was marked by protests,

often violent, on our Nation's streets and campuses.

We entered the 1970s still engaged in an undeclared
conflict in Vietnam which was unpopular with some segments
of our pooulation. Not in recent history had this country been
so divided over an issue, and this division was not limited
to rhetoric but included demonstrations that often erupted

into violence.

There were deliberate criminal acts, including
bombings and sabotage, by persons opposed to our involvement
in Vietnam. The role of the FBI in this confrontation was
clearly to thwart the efforts of those who resorted to

violence as an expression of their opposition.

With the cessation of the Vietnam War in early 1973,
a major cause for divisiveness in this country was eliminated, and

the potential for violence was lessened, but not eliminated.

The FBI began closing thousands of investigations
at that time as determinations were made that certain groups
and individuals no longer were engaged in activities that

were likely to involve violations of Federal law.

The FBI met the unusual challenges of the 1960s and
early 1970s. The Senate Select Committee has examined these

and other problems in the intelligence field which led

to the creation of this Oversight Committee; and as the

Committee is aware, the FBI fully cooperated in that review.

You have my absolute assurance that your Committee
will receive the same full cooperation in carrying out its
responsibilities under Senate Resolution 400.

One of the tasks confronting this Committee is the
formulation of a legislative charter defining the FBI's
jurisdiction in the domestic security and intelligence fields.
This will be a most precise and demanding undertaking.

As I remarked to Senator Church's Committee, the
legislative charter must be sufficiently flexible that it does
not stifle the FBI's effectiveness in combating the high
incidence of crime and violence across the United States.

The charter must clearly address the demonstrated problems

of the past; yet, it must amply recognize the fact that times
change and so also do the nature and thrust of our criminal
and subversive challenges.

The fact that the Department of Justice has
undertaken the formulation of operational guidelines governing
this-area of our activities does not in any manner diminish
the need for legislation. The responsibility for conferring

jurisdiction resides with the Congress.
