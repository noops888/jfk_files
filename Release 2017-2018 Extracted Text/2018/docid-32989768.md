SA Sammon was then asked if SAs Francis McCarron,
Jack Dawson, Vincent Stacey, Leon Pryor, and Leonard 7
C, Peterson. were assigned to the Number 5 squad in
Miami from 1961 through 1964. SA Sammon replied
that SAs McCarron, Dawson, and Peterson were assigned
to that squad; however, it was not Sammon's recollection
that either Stacey or Pryor were so assigned.

SA Sammon was then asked to give a breakdown
by classifications as to the responsibilities of each
of the six Miami squads from 1961 through 1964, which
information was furnished to the committee representatives. .

advised that he was the “backup Agent" assigned to Bill
Saige, an FBI informant, while SA Sammon was assigned

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

SA Sammon was asked to identify Intelligence

_ Division Officers of the Miami, Florida, Police ¢

Department, which SA Sammon was unable to do, nor
was Sammon in a position to advise whether or not
any information furnished by Somerset was disseminated
to that intelligence unit during the period of
1961-1964.

SA Sammon was then queried at length regarding
Ku Klux Klan activity in Mississippi, beginning in 1964,
im particular, - information regardimg United-Klars of -
America. (UKA), White Knights of the Ku- Klux Klan naeeeee
GIRKKK); andthe -"Silver Dollar Group" of the WRKKK =

. Mississippi.- -SA Sammon furnished.a lengthy “dissertation

regarding Klan activities in Mississippi since his
arrival in 1964,

SA Sammon was then asked if he had conducted
any investigation regarding "Merkin". SA Sammon replied
that immediately after the shooting death of Dr. Martin
Luther King, SA Sammon was assigned the responsibility
of traveling through North Mississippi with photographs
of the evidence left by King's assailant, exhibiting
those photographs at motels, service stations, in
North Mississippi to determine if any of the photographs
could be identified.

SA Sammon was asked if he was aware of Somerset's

attempt to assassinate King in Montgomery, Alabama,
in 1958 through poisoning his food. SA Sammon advised
the committee that he was not aware of any such attempts.

SA Sammon was then queried regarding Bureau
regulations regarding amounts of money paid informants and
policy of the Bureau to overseeing those payments.

SA Sammon explained to the committee that such amounts
are normally determined by the Agent contacting the
informant and are paid on a COD basis based on the value
of the information furnished by the informant. SA Sammon
advised that the Bureau oversees these payments only in
an auditing or accounting of the particular informant's
payment fund.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

SA Sammon was then questioned regarding the
Bureau policy in discontinuing informants and if the 7
informants are advised that they are being so discontinued.
SA Sammon advised that the informant is so advised when
he is discontinued, usually determined when the informant
bas furnished a lack of positive information, or when
he has exposed himself as an informant, and of course
upon his death. 7

SA Sammon was then questioned regarding
Somerset's personal involvement in violence; Somerset's
personal bigotry toward minority races; his bigotry
regarding union membership; his carrying of weapons;
and Somerset's Knowledge, of explosive devices; and
pene Somerset regarding Thomas,

2

To these questions, SA Sammon advised that he
did not have any personal information of acts of violence
performed by Somerset; and that the only personal bigotry
exhibited by Somerset was Somerset's apparent dislike
for SA Sammon, as Somerset felt that SA Sammon was
of Jewish descent. SA Sammon advised that he had no
knowledge of any acts of bigotry in union membership as
indicated by Somerset, nor was SA Sammon aware of Somerset
ever carrying a weapon or Somerset's knowledge of any 5
explosive devices. SA Sammon advised the committee that \
he did not recall Somerset ever furnishing any information
regarding Thomas Albert "Tommy" Tarrants; however, SA Sammon
was acquainted with Tarrants, having been involved in’a
firearms shootout confrontation with Tarrants in 1969.
The committee pressed for further details concerning
this shootout and the committee was advised that in
August, 1969, Tarrants and two other inmates of the
Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP), Parchman, Mississippi,
escaped from that penitentiary and were thereafter subjects
of an unlawful flight to avoid confinement investigation,
and were considered by the FBI to be Federal fugitives.
The committee was advised that in August, 1969, information
was received by the Jackson, Mississippi, Office that the
three escapees were hiding in a heavily wooded dense area
near Jackson, Mississippi. Thereafter, SA Sammon and
many other Jackson, Mississippi, Agents attempted to
locate and apprehend Tarrants and the two other inmates,
which attempts resulted in a gun battle, causing -
one of the inmates, name unrecalled, to be killed by

law enforcement officers, consisting of FBI Agents,
Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol. MHSP) officers,
and those of the Rankin County Sheriff's Office.

The committee was advised that this was SA Sammon's
first and last contact with Tarrants, SA Sammon

in answer to specific questions, advised that he had

no personal knowledge of the acts of Tarrants performed
on a residence of a “Jewish businessman in Meridian, .
Mississippi.

’ SA Sammon was then questioned regarding the
availability of FBI informants to other Federal or
local law enforcement agencies, and the Bureau policy
as pertaining to that availability. SA Sammon advised
- the committee that it is the practice of the FBI,
as well as other law enforcement agencies, not to
reveal the identity of Bureau informants to those
agencies, even though the information furnished by
those informants may be disseminated to those agencies.

The committee at this point took exception with °
SA Sammon indicating it was their feeling that the FBI
"receives all information but does not share information”
with other law enforcement agencies, Federal, state,.and
local. The committee at this point was unequivocally
advised that this has not and is not the case of the FBI,
and that information obtained by the FBI which is of an
interest to those agencies, is disseminated to them,
even though the identity of the informant furnishing
such information is not revealed to those agencies.

SA Sammon was again asked for his knowledge

as to the availability of Bill Somerset to the Intelligence
. Unit of the Miami, Florida, Police Department, to which

SA Sammon again advised that he was not aware of such

availability during the years of 1961-1964, the only

period that SA Sammon was acquainted with Somerset.
7 SA Sammon was asked as to the degree of
confidence and reliability regarding the information
furnished by Somerset while an FBI informant. SA Sammon
advised from 1961-1964, it was his opinion that the
information furnished by Somerset was reliable, and that
SA Sammon had confidence in that information.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

At one point during the questioning, when

- SA Sammon was being questioned as to squad assignment
classifications, and identities of Agents of the Miami,
Florida, FBI Office from 1961-1964, SA Sammon advised
the committee that as that period of time was from
14-17 years in the past, SA Sammon would try to be as
accurate ‘as possible as to monthsand years involved;
however, the committee was reminded SA Sammon's
recollection of the events may be six months to perhaps -
a year off. Mark Speiser advised SA Sammon that the
committee would only allow a four month leeway. This
comment. may have been misunderstood by SA Sammon and
may have been in jest by Speiser; however, in any regard,
Speiser was advised that SA Sammon stood on his previous
statement that events occurring 14-17 years ago would be
timed as accurately as SA Sammon possibly could; however,
there would be no "four month allowance” imposed
on SA Sammon, unless the committee intended to furnish
him documentary verification. There was no such
documentary verification furnished SA Sammon during
his interrogation, with the exception of SA Sammon
being furnished a lengthy article from what appeared
to be the “Parade” or pictorial section of the Miami,
Florida, Herald, Sunday Supplement Newspaper, which
article appeared to be regarding Bill Somerset. This
article was furnished SA Sammon briefly in an effort
to identify Somerset by photograph as it appeared in
the article. SA Sammon was unable to positively identify
Somerset, due to the length of time involved, and the
fact that the photograph was net a good likeness, or
Xerex copy, as the photegraph of Somerset, made him
appear older and thinner in appearance. SA Sammon
advised the committee that the poor photograph did
resemble Somerset; however, if the committee had not
advised Sammon that it was of Somerset, SA Sammon
would be unable to identify him. SA Sammon was not
furnished the article to read. ©

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

SA Sammon was furnished a name of an
individual in Miami, Florida, which name SA Sammon ao
failed to record, and therefore the identity of
that individual is not recalled by SA Sammon.

SA Sammon was asked by the committee if he was
acquainted with this individual. SA Sammon advised
the individual was unknown to him.

SA Sammon was then advised that this
individual was a house painter in Miami, and SA 7
Sammon was asked- if Bill Somerset _ was acquainted : sasRSEEREEDE

i is. individual. | os edema
SA Sammon- advised that he- then recalled _
that: this individual may be identical to a person --
who was at the scene of the James Meredith
integration disorder at the University of Mississipi,
Oxford, Mississippi, which SA Sammon believed to
be in 1963. The committee was advised that the
incident arose over Meredith, a Negro, attempting
to register to attend the University of Mississippi.

SA Sammon recalled that a lead was received
at the Miami Office to identify and interview this
Miami house painter as his vehicle had been observed
at the University of Mississippi campus during the
disorder involving the registration of Meredith at
that university.

7 SA Sammon advised that he and SA Leonard
c. “Peterson contacted Bill Somerset for background
information on this individual and that Somerset
was acquainted with house painter and furnished
SA Peterson background information concerning this
individual, to the best of SA Sammon's recollection
involving the house painter being a member of
National States Rights Party (NSRP).

a Thereafter, SA Sammon assisted SA Peterson

in-the interview of this individual in Miami in either

the summer of 1963 or 1964. SA Sammon recalled that
the individual was painting a house at the time of the

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

interview, was very hostile towards the interviewing
Agents; however, at the persistence of SA Peterson
he was interviewed regarding his appearance at the
University of Mississippi.

A short time thereafter, an article appeared
in the newspaper of the NSRP on the front page which
was submitted by this house painter. This article
referred to his interview with.SA Peterson and SA
Sammon, and referred to Peterson as “a blond haired
Swede” and to SA Sammon as “a Jew bastard” or words
to that effect.

: SA Sammon was asked if he was acquainted with
Joseph A. Milteer, or if Somerset ever furnished any
information regarding Milteer and his activities. SA
Sammon advised he was not acquainted with Milteer and
did not recall Somerset furnishing any information.
regarding him.

PAGE SEVEN (ME 44-1987 SUB M) UNCLAS E F T 0
AND THE APPOINTMENT. HOOTEN REFUSED TO HONOR WILSON'S REQUEST

AND QUESTIONED HIS SINCERITY REGARDING HIS CLAIM FOR BOTH THE
KILLING AND THE APPOINTMENT WITH THE SHERIFF. WILSON INSISTED

HE HAD KILLED KING AND STATED HE HAD MET WITH SHERIFF BARKSDALE
PERSONALLY ABOUT 2 GEEKS PREVIOUSLY. HE TERMINATED THE CALL

WHEN HE REALIZED HOOTEN WOULD NOT CALL THE SHERIFF AS HE
REQUESTED .

ACCORD ING TO HOOTEN, WILSON IS AN EXTREMELY HEAVY DRINKER,
HE FEELS THAT WILSON WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL WHEN
CALLED AND THAT HIS HEAVY CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL HAS HAD AN
ADVERSE EFFECT ON HIS MIND. WILSON WAS AT ONE TIME PLACED IN AN ,
UNKNOWN HOSPITAL IN TEXAS BY HIS SON, STEVEN, TO HAVE HIM
TREATED FOR ALCOHOLISM, HOOTEN IS OF THE OPINION THAT WILSON
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF DR. KING BUT DUE
TO THE MENTAL DETERIORATION OF HIS MIND MAY BELIEVE HE DID.
HOOTEN IS NOT CERTAIN BUT BELIEVES WILSON WAS NOT IN THE

MEMPHIS AREA AT THE TIME DR. KING WAS KILLED.

ee BURGESS AUDIE WILSON, JR., an inmate of the Ocean Springs
City Jail, Ocean Springs, Mississippi, furnished the following
information to ROYCE DAVID HIGNIGHT and K. P. WHITE-SPUNNER, JR.,

who he knows to be Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, after having been advised the purpose of the interview: being
his knowledge and involvement in the murder of Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING
and after having been advised of his Constitutional rights which he
waived as indicated by an Advice of Rights’ and Waiver of Rights Form
which he signed:

Mr. WILSON advised that at the time prior to the murder of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, he was living in Grandview, Missouri, in a house
on Byers Road with his wife, BETTY LOU, and his three children,
DEBORAH, STEVE, and MARK. He was in the Air Force Reserve and also
operated a jewelry store.

In the course of his jewelry business, he met a white male

Italian who was in his late sixties and was approximately 5 feet 9
inches tall, weighed approximately 230 pounds, and who operated a
jewelry trade shop on Walnut Street. He stated that this white male
introduced him to another white male Italian by the name of MITCH
(Last Name-Unknown), who was in his mid fifties and was approximately
5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighed approximately 190 pounds, who had
black, wavy hair and had. some connection with a bonding company, and
also MITCH s brother, name not recalled, who fit the same physical
description as MITCH, but who had numerous cut scars on his face. ©

He stated that. MITCH started. delivering jewelry to him for
the purpose of having the stones removed from the fittings. He stated
MITCH usually met him at a bar on Walnut Street which was run by a
white female and it. also appeared that MITCH might have been a part
owner or had an interest in this bar. He stated that due to the
volume of jewelry that MITCH was bringing to him, he asked MITCH
about it, and MITCH advised him that it was stolen jewelry. MITCH
told him, however, that he, WILSON, was in as deep as he, MITCH, was
and that he would have to continue working with MITCH. He stated
this relationship with MITCH continued until 1970.

He stated that MITCH brought up the idea of killing KING
and said that there was a $50,000 contract on him. However, he

never said who put out the contract but said that he could get
the money for WILSON if he killed KING.

WILSON stated that MITCH was well aware of his, WILSON's,
. thoughts concerning KING and the black civil rights movement, in-
that his father, who was a pastor of the Central Baptist Church at
Grenada, Mississippi, died of a heart attack which he, WILSON,
thought was caused as a result of racial tensions at Grenada brought
on by the forceful integration of his father's church.

WILSON stated that approximately five or six months before
¥ KING's murder, he started gathering information on the movements,
habits, and whereabouts of KING.

WILSON advised that he had a red and white Bonanza airplane,
Register Number 34L, and a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft, which was
blue and white, which planes he used to fly to different places
where KING was supposed to be. He stated that he recalls going to
Huntsville, Alabama; Tupelo, Mississippi; Jackson, Tennessee; Atlanta,
Georgia; and Greenville, South Carolina. He stated that while at
Tupelo, Mississippi, he stayed in the Ramada Inn and believes that
in the other places he visited he stayed in Holiday Inns.

He stated that MITCH furnished him a Japanese sniper rifle.
He stated that he kept the rifle and that just before Christmas of
1975, he had it reworked at a gunshop in Columbus, Mississippi, on
Fourth Street across from a bank. He stated that the last knowledge
he had of the rifle, his older son, STEVEN WAYNE WILSON, had the
rifle and a shotgun but had told him that he had sold it.

Mr. WILSON advised that there was a garbage strike in
progress at Memphis, Tennessee, and that MITCH called him at his
store in Grandview, Missouri, and told him that KING was coming to
Memphis for.a rally and instructed WILSON to come to Memphis where
he was to.meet two men at the Wonder Bar located at the corner of
Summer Avenue and White Station Road.

Mr. WILSON advised that he flew to Memphis, Tennessee,
in the Bonanza aircraft and landed at an airport just north of
Raleigh,. Tennessee. He stated that the airport was operated by a
long-time acquaintance of his who had attended a church which was
pastored by WILSON's father in the past. WILSON stated that his
daughter, DEBORAH, picked him up at the airport in her 1965 white
Mustang, which WILSON had previously bought for her and which was
registered in his name in Missouri.

NW 55186 Docld:32989768 Page 185


IN 62-544

He advised that DEOBRAH and her mother, BETTY LOU, were
staying at the residence of WILSON's father-in-law, VERNON HOOTEN,
* 3095 Ruskin Road, Memphis, Tennessee. He stated that HOOTEN had: had
a heart attack and that his wife and daughter.were temporarily stay-—
ing at the HOOTEN residence. -

WILSON advised that he went to the Wonder Bar and while
having a drink two white men approached him, one having an accent
Similar to a Puerto Rican.

The two white males furnished him with FBI credentials,
which he stated had a black and white photograph of himself on it,
and they took him and showed him where KING was to hold the rally.
They then took WILSON to a hotel on South Main Street near Beale
Street and took him to a room on the third floor. They told him
he was to be in the. crowd at the rally and that a decoy shot was to
be fired and that he was then to shoot. They said that KING had a
habit of raising his arms over his head when he was making a speech
and that the second time that he did so, the shots were to be fired.

WILSON stated that on the day of the murder he was in the
crowd standing near a wood fence approximately 60 feet from where
KING was standing and that when KING raised his arms the second time
he shot him.

Mr. WILSON advised that he had the rifle which he used
strapped to his belt under a suit coat and attached to his belt on
a swivel.. He stated that. the barrel protruded from below his coat
but no one questioned him concerning it. He said that he had prac-—
ticed a great deal swiveling the rifle and firing it.

He advised that after the shooting, he was stopped by the
Memphis police, but he showed them the. credentials, and they let
him go,.and he walked on down the street approximately two blocks
to where he had left the. Mustang parked. He advised that he got
in the. Mustang and drove back to the HOOTEN residence, and his
daughter, DEBORAH, then took him to the airport, and he got his
plane and flew back to. Kansas City. He stated that the airport
that he used was on the Kansas side on the highway to Olathe,
Kansas. He stated the airport was run by (First Name Unknown)
FISHER. He-also stated that he had purchased the Bonanza aircraft
from FISHER. i

WILSON advised that approximately one week before the
murder, MITCH gave him $25,000 in $20 bills, and following the
murder, MITCH gave him another $25,000, at which time he gave the
eredentials back to MITCH.

Baptist Church, Grenada, approximately four or five years
ago when he died. SPEARS stated WILSON's wife, first name
possibly GLADYS, stayed in Grenada approximately one year
and lived at 375 Levee Street, which house is now vacant
and in the process of being torn down. While in Grenada,

B. A. WILSON and wife lived in the church parsonage located
behind Central Baptist Church. There were no children living
with WILSON and his wife at that time, and if they had any
children, they were all grown.

Review of City Directory shows Mrs. LILLY M. WILSON
residing 375 South Levee Street, Grenada.

Reverend JOE BELL, Pastor, Central Baptist Church,
advised BURGESS AUDIE WILSON was pastor at Central Baptist
Church for approximately 13 years: until he died of a heart
attack on 1/7/67. BELL estimated WILSON was pastor from 1954
to 1967. He stated WILSON and his second wife, LILLY, lived
in the church parsonage.

BELL stated WILSON had four children who were as
follows: Mrs. CHRISTINE GUNTHORPE (phonetic), who lives in
Fulton, MS; BILL WILSON, Kansas City, Kansas; rin. Cay

BELL believed all of WILSON's children were married
and knew that B. A. WILSON had churches at Camp Creek, Fulton,
MS; Lynn Station, north of Jasper, Alabama; and at Eldridge,
Alabama, prior to coming to Grenada in 1954, LILLY WILSON,
wife of B. A. WILSON, died approximately one year ago in a
nursing home at Fulton, MS. B. A. WILSON and his wife, LILLY,
had a house in Grenada located at the corner of Levee and 4th
Street, and BELL knew of no other land the WILSONs owned in
Grenada. Concerning BILL WILSON, BELL stated that he was a
pilot and flew for a freight line or unknown airline in Kansas
gity, Kansas, and reportedly flew freight to Guam and other
islands.

BELL knew that BILL WILSON had caused his father
problems concerning debts that his father, B. A. WILSON, had
to pay, and he believed that BILL WILSON had been arrested on
an embezzlement charge possibly in California. BELL recalled
that BILL WILSON flew into Memphis, Tennessee, on Sunday, the
day before the funeral, which was on a Monday, with his second
wife. BELL did not know if BILL WILSON had any children. BELL
did not know how long BILL WILSON stayed in Grenada as he,
BELL, left on Tuesday, the day after the funeral. BELL did
know that BILL WILSON's stepmother, LILLY WILSON, had no use
for BILL WILSON, and LILLY WILSON told BELL she never wanted
to lay eyes on him again or have BILL WILSON put a foot in her
house. LILLY WILSON told BELL that BILL WILSON did not deserve
any part of his father's inheritance as the father had already
paid off many of his debts.

BELL stated he did hear that BILL WILSON did obtain
his father's shotgun during the settlement of the estate,
which shotgun at that time was valued between $150 and $200.
BELL further stated BILL WILSON's other brother and BILL
WILSON apparently argued over the’ shotgun, and the other
unknown brother left in disgust, leaving the shotgun to BILL
WILSON. BELL stated an attorney by the name of FREDERICKS in
Grenada read B. A. WILSON, SR.'s will.

A BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

@

Date of transcription __ August 21, 1978

CARL D. FORTNA, Route 6, Box 387, Ocean Springs,
Mississippi, telephone number 875~0220, was advised of the
identity of the interviewing Agent and the nature of the
interview. FORTNA, a white male, born June 2, 1932, in
Great Bend, Kansas, advised that he completed the tenth
grade of high school, and he could read and write.

FORTNA stated that he met BILL WILSON in Belton,
Missouri, in 1966 or 1967. FORTNA was in the Air Force at
this time stationed at Richards-Gebauer Air Force Base in
Belton, Missouri. FORTNA stated that WILSON and WILSON's
wife owned a jewelry store in Belton, Missouri, and that a
WILSON was a member of the 442nd Air Force Reserve Unit
stationed at Richards-Gebauer Air Force Base. FORTNA stated
he knew WILSON through their association in the VFW in Belton,
Missouri. FORTNA stated that he, FORTINA, retired from the Air
Force in 1969 and did not see WILSON again except for one
brief moment in 1972 until approximately two months ago.
WILSON came to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, from Lafayette,
Louisiana, about two months ago and lived in the Twin Pines
Motel on: Highway 90, Ocean Springs, Mississippi. On July 23,
1978, WILSON moved into a house owned by FORTNA located next

_ door to FORTNA's present residence. eee

At approximately 4:15 PM on August 18, 1978, WILSON
asked FORTNA to come into WILSON's house, that he had something
very important to tell him. WILSON told FORTNA, "I killed that
black son-of-a-bitch." FORTNA asked WILSON who he was talking
about, and WILSON replied MARTIN LUTHER KING. FORTNA stated
that he told WILSON he did not believe him, and WILSON said,

"I am telling you the truth. I actually killed him. I've
been living with it for ten years, and I can't take it anymore."
WILSON told FORTNA that MARTIN LUTHER KING was responsible for
WILSON's father's death. WILSON did not elaborate further on
this. WILSON told FORTNA that this killing was "engineered"
by LOU CRUZ (phonetic). FORTNA stated that he knows LOU CRUZ
and that LOU CRUZ owned or still owns Lou Cruz Jewelry, 1505
Main Street, Grandview, Missouri. WILSON told FORTNA that he

. drove to the State Line Airport in Kansas City, Missouri,
driving a new Ford Thunderbird. WILSON told FORTNA that CRUZ

also owned an identical Ford Thunderbird. WILSON left his
Thunderbird at the airport and flew to Memphis, Tennessee.
CRUZ came to the airport and picked up WILSON's Thunderbird
and took it from the airport’ so it would not be noticed.

When WILSON arrived in Memphis, he borrowed a white Ford
Mustang that he had purchased for his daughter, DEBORAH.
DEBORAH had driven from Kansas City to Memphis in the Mustang.
WILSON told FORTNA that he went to the motel where MARTIN
LUTHER KING was staying and that he used a Japanese sniper
rifle and shot KING holding the rifle on his hip. He stated
that this rifle is now in the possession of WILSON's son,
STEVE. WILSON told FORTNA that he was driving away from the
scene in the Mustang, and he was stopped by the Memphis police,
but he talked himself out of a ticket, and the car was not
searched. He stated that the rifle was in the trunk of the
ear at this time. WILSON told FORTNA that he then flew his
airplane back to Kansas City, and CRUZ picked him up at the
airport and took him home. :

FORTNA stated that when WILSON told him the above
information, he, FORTNA, believed that WILSON thought he was
telling the truth and that he swore on his mother's grave in
front of a priest that it was the truth. FORTNA stated that
WILSON had never mentioned this subject prior to this instance.
FORTNA stated that WILSON has been drinking heavily for the
past two months and has lied to him several times in the past
two months. WILSON, on occasion, would tell FORTNA’ that he
had been married three or four times since divorcing his first
wife and then come back at a later date and say that he had
not been married after divorcing his first wife.

FORTNA stated that WILSON is an excellent pilot,
that he, FORTNA, has flown with WILSON through bad weather,
and WILSON had no problems flying the aircraft.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date of transcription_August 21, 1978

CARL D. FORTNA, Route 6, Box 387, Ocean Springs,
Mississippi, telephone number 875-0220, was advised of the
identity of the interviewing Agent and the nature of the
interview. FORTNA, a white male, born June 2, 1932, in
Great Bend, Kansas, advised that he completed the tenth
grade of high school, and he could read and write.

FORTNA stated that he met BILL WILSON in Belton,
Missouri, in 1966 or 1967. FORTNA was in the Air Force at
this time stationed at Richards-Gebauer Air Force Base in
Belton, Missouri. FORTNA stated that WILSON and WILSON's
wife owned a jewelry store in Belton, Missouri, and that
WILSON was a member of the 442nd Air Force Reserve Unit
stationed at Richards-Gebauer Air Force Base. FORTNA stated
he knew WILSON through their association in the VFW in Belton,
Missouri. FORTNA stated that he, FORTNA, retired from the Air
Force in 1969 and did not see WILSON again except for one
brief moment in 1972 until approximately two months ago.
WILSON came to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, from Lafayette,
Louisiana, about two months ago and lived in the Twin Pines
Motel on Highway 90, Ocean Springs, Mississippi. On July 23,
1978, WILSON moved into a house owned by FORTNA located next
door to FORTNA's present residence.

At approximately 4:15 PM on August 18, 1978, WILSON
asked FORTNA to come into WILSON's house, that he had something
very important to tell him. WILSON told FORTNA, "I killed that
black son-of-a-bitch." FORTNA askéd WILSON who he was talking
about, and WILSON replied MARTIN LUTHER KING. FORTNA stated
that he told WILSON he did not believe him, and WILSON said,

"I am telling you the truth. I actually killed him. I've

been living with it for ten years, and I can't take it anymore."
WILSON told FORTNA that MARTIN LUTHER KING was responsible for
WILSON's father's death. WILSON did not elaborate further on
this. WILSON told FORTNA that this killing was "engineered"

by LOU CRUZ (phonetic). FORTNA stated that he knows LOU CRUZ
and that LOU CRUZ owned or still owns Lou Cruz Jewelry, 1505
Main Street, Grandview, Missouri. WILSON told FORTNA that he
drove to the State Line Airport in Kansas City, Missouri,
driving a new Ford Thunderbird. WILSON told FORTNA that CRUZ

also owned an identical Ford Thunderbird. WILSON left his
Thunderbird at the airport and flew to Memphis, Tennessee.
CRUZ came to the airport and picked up WILSON's Thunderbird
and took it from the airport so it would not be noticed.

When WILSON arrived in Memphis, he borrowed a white Ford
Mustang that he had purchased for his daughter, DEBORAH.
DEBORAH had driven from Kansas City to Memphis in the Mustang.
WILSON told FORTNA that he went to the motel where MARTIN
LUTHER KING was staying and that he used a Japanese sniper
rifle and shot KING holding the rifle on his hip. He stated
that this rifle is now in the possession of WILSON's son,
STEVE. WILSON told FORTNA that he was driving away from the
scene in the Mustang, and he was stopped by the Memphis police,
but he talked himself out of a ticket, and the car was not
searched. He stated that the rifle was in the trunk of the
car at this time. WILSON told FORTNA that he then flew his
airplane back to Kansas City, and CRUZ picked him up at the
airport and took him home.

FORTNA stated that when WILSON told him the above
information, he, FORTNA, believed that WILSON thought he was
telling the truth and that he swore on his mother's grave in
front of a priest that it was the truth. FORTNA stated that
WILSON had never mentioned this subject prior to this instance.
FORTNA stated that WILSON has been drinking heavily for the
past two months and has lied to him several times in the past
two months. WILSON, on occasion, would tell FORTNA that he
had been married three or four times since divorcing his first
wife and then come back at a later date and say that he had
not been married after divorcing his first wife.

FORTNA stated that WILSON is an excellent pilot,
that he, FORTNA, has flown with WILSON through bad weather,
and WILSON had no problems flying the aircraft.

The following investigation was conducted by
SA GWYNNE L. HUPFER at Columbus, Mississippi, on

A physical observation of 401 5th Street South,
Columbus, Mississippi, revealed that this is the address
of the Candlewood Apartments.

that he is the owner of the Candlewood Apartments.
LANCASTFR stated that he does not recall anyone by the
name BURGESS AUDIE WILSON, JR., or BILL WILSON, renting
an apartment from him. LANCASTER advised, however, that
he has had a great deal turnovers in these apartments
aver the past several years and he could not possibly
recall all his tenants by name. LANCASTER advised

manager of the Candlewood Apartments for him for several
years. He stated that she might recall this individual.

LUKE JOSEPH BRODERICK, 1204 Hammer Smith Lane,
Ocean Springs, Mississippi, telephone number 875-1404,
was advised of the identity of the interviewing Agent
and the nature of the interview. BRODERICK stated
that he is the manager of the Angle Inn Restaurant
and Lounge, Highway 90, Ocean Springs, Mississippi.

BRODERICK, a white male, stated that he
was born February 7, 1940, and has completed three
years of college.

BRODERICK stated that he is acquainted with
BILL WILSON, who has been coming to the Angle Inn
for approximately two months as a customer. BRODERICK
stated that late on the night of August 16, 1978,
he, BRODERICK, came to the Angle Inn and WILSON was
sitting at the bar and had been drinking Draft Beer
and was half drunk. BRODERICK stated he started
talking to WILSON and WILSON said that he, WILSON,
knew more about the MARTIN LUTHER KING assassination
than people thought. WILSON started telling
BRODERICK about how someone else had shot KING other
than EARL RAY. WILSON was describing the other
assassin in the third person. BRODERICK stated that
after WILSON talked for a few minutes, he, BRODERICK,
realized that WILSON was actually talking about himself
shooting KING. When he questioned WILSON on this,
WILSON stated "I definitely shot him. I was 50 feet
away. I blew that nigger shit away". WILSON stated
that he had flown to Memphis, Tennessee, in a private
plane and he stated that he had shot KING from approxi-
mately 50 feet away while standing on the ground.
WILSON told BRODERICK there were more people involved
than himself and that firecrackers and other shots
were going off at the time he shot KING. He stated
that RAY was a scapegoat in this conspiracy.

WILSON stated that he was turning himself
in to an old friend of his, GENE (last name unknown),
who is the Sheriff of Shelby County. WILSON told

BRODERICK that he was scheduled to turn himself in at 9:30 a.m.,
on August 18, 1978, at the Holiday Inn in Biloxi, Mississippi.
At the time WILSON was telling BRODERICK the above information,
WILSON had tears in his eyes and said he had been living with
this on his conscience for ten years and could not stand it
anymore. Also listening in to a portion of the above
conversation was part+time bartender, DOROTHY WOODSIDE.

BRODERICK stated that he asked WILSON during the
conversation on the night of August 16, 1978, if he was
RAOUL and WILSON did not either deny or confirm this
statement.

BRODERICK stated that WILSON had dated a female,
RITA HERRINGTON, and that RITA HERRINGTON's son, HOWARD
HERRINGTON, went to New Orleans with WILSON at one time.

BRODERICK stated that WILSON came into the Angle
Inn on the morning of August 18, 1978, and stated that he
was turning himself in to the Sheriff of Shelby County
at 6:30 p.m., on that day at the Holiday Inn in Gulfport,
Mississippi. WILSON used the pay telephone in the Angle
Inn to call the Sheriff of Shelby County and he wrote the
number of the sheriff on a Yellow Cab Company card on the
wall by the pay telephone. BRODERICK made available this
Yellow Cab Company sign to the interviewing Agent.
Written on this sign was the telephone number 901:
528-3600. WILSON stated that he could not turn himself in
on the morning of August 18, 1978, because the sheriff
could not be ‘at the motel because of the police strike
now going on in Memphis, Tennessee.

who he knows to be Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, after having been advised the purpose of the interview being
his knowledge and involvement in the murder of Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING
and after having been advised of his Constitutional rights which he
waived as indicated by an Advice of Rights and Waiver of Rights Form
which he signed:

Mr. WILSON advised that at the time prior to the murder of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, he was living in Grandview, Missouri, in a house
on Byers Road with his wife, BETTY LOU, and his three children,
DEBORAH, STEVE, and MARK. He was in the Air Force Reserve and also
operated a jewelry store.

In the course of his jewelry business, he met a white male
Italian who was in his late sixties and was approximately 5 feet 9
inches tall, weighed approximately 230 pounds, and who operated a
jewelry trade shop on Walnut Street. He stated that this white male
introduced him to another white male Italian by the name of MITCH

black, wavy hair and had some connection with a bonding company, and

the purpose of having the stones removed from the fittings. He stated
MITCH usually met him at a bar on Walnut Street which was run by a
white female and it. also appeared that MITCH might have been a part
owner or had an interest in this bar. He stated that due to the
volume of jewelry that MITCH was bringing to him, he asked MITCH
about it, and MITCH advised him that it was stolen jewelry. MITCH
told him, however, that he, WILSON, was in as deep as he, MITCH, was
and that he would have to continue working with MITCH. He stated
this relationship with MITCH continued until 1970.

never said who put out the contract but said that he could get
the money for WILSON if he killed. KING.

WILSON stated that MITCH was well aware of his, WILSON's,
. thoughts concerning KING and the black civil rights movement, in
that his father, who was a pastor of the Central Baptist Church at
Grenada, Mississippi, died of a heart attack which he, WILSON,
thought was caused as a result of racial tensions at Grenada brought
on by the forceful integration of his father's church.

WILSON stated that approximately five or six months before
KING's murder, he started gathering information on the movements,
habits, and whereabouts of KING.

WILSON advised that he had a red and white Bonanza airplane,
Register Number 34L, and a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft, which was
blue and white, which planes he used to fly to different places
where KING was supposed to be. He stated that he recalls going to
Huntsville, Alabama; Tupelo, Mississippi; Jackson, Tennessee; Atlanta,
Georgia; and Greenville, South Carolina. He stated that while at
Tupelo, Mississippi, he stayed in the Ramada Inn and believes that
in the other places he visited he stayed in Holiday Inns.

He stated that MITCH furnished him a Japanese sniper rifle.
He stated that he kept the rifle and that just before Christmas of
1975, he had it reworked at a gunshop in Columbus, Mississippi, on
Fourth Street across from a bank. He stated that the last knowledge
he had of the rifle, his older son, STEVEN WAYNE WILSON, had the
rifle and a shotgun but had told him that he had sold it.

Mr. WILSON advised that there was a garbage strike in
progress at Memphis, Tennessee, and that MITCH called him at his
store in Grandview, Missouri, and told him that KING was coming to
Memphis for.a rally and instructed WILSON to come to Memphis where
he was to meet two men at the Wonder Bar located at the corner of
Summer Avenue and White Station Road.

Mr. WILSON advised that he flew to Memphis, Tennessee,
in the Bonanza aircraft and landed at an airport just north of
Raleigh,. Tennessee. He stated that the airport was operated by a
long-time acquaintance of his who had attended a church which was
pastored by WILSON's father in the past. WILSON stated that his
daughter, DEBORAH, picked him up at the airport in her 1965 white
Mustang, which WILSON had previously bought for her and which was
registered in his name in Missouri.

a heart attack and that his wife and daughter were temporarily stay-
ing at the HOOTEN residence.

WILSON advised that he went to the Wonder Bar and while
having a drink two white men approached him, one having an accent
similar to a Puerto Rican.

The two white males furnished him with FBI credentials,
which he stated had a black and white photograph of himself on it,
and they took him and showed him where KING was to hold the rally.
They then took WILSON to a hotel on South Main Street near Beale
Street and took him to a room on the third floor. They told him
he was to be in the crowd at the rally and that a decoy shot was to
be fired and that he was then to shoot. They said that KING had a
habit of raising his arms over his head when he was making a speech
and that the second time that he did so, the shots were to be fired.

WILSON stated that on the day of the murder he was in the
crowd standing near a wood fence approximately 60 feet from where
KING was standing and that when KING raised his arms the second time
he shot him.

Mr. WILSON advised that he had the rifle which he used
strapped to his belt under a suit coat and attached to his belt on
a swivel.. He stated that the barrel protruded from below his coat
but no one questioned him concerning it. He said that he had prac-
ticed a great deal swiveling the rifle and firing it.

He advised that after the shooting, he was stopped by the
Memphis police, but he showed them the credentials, and they let
him go,. and he walked on down the street approximately two blocks
to where he had left the Mustang parked. He advised that he got
in the. Mustang and drove back to the HOOTEN residence, and his
daughter, DEBORAH, then took him to the airport, and he got his
plane and flew back to Kansas City. He stated that the airport
that he used was on the Kansas side on the highway to Olathe,
Kansas. He stated the airport was run by (First Name Unknown)

credentials back to MITCH.

who would get this shotgun which BELL stated was worth
approximately $150 or $200 at that time. BELL stated
that he heard that the other WILSON brother walked
out in disgust, and apparently left the shotgun with
BILL WILSON.

BELL stated that CHRISTINE GUNTHORPE (phonetic)
was the administrator of the estate, and an attorney
by the name of FREDERISKS read the will.

BELL concluded by stating that the State
Baptist Convention Headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi
would have the full detail of B. A. WILSON’s churches
and their locations.

LANCASTER stated that he does not recall anyone by the
name BURGESS AUDIE WILSON, JR., or BILL WILSON, renting
an apartment from him. LANCASTER advised, however, that
he has had a great deal turnovers in these apartments
ever the past several years and he could not possibly
recall all his tenants by name. LANCASTER advised

manager of the Candlewood Apartments for him for several
years. He stated that she might recall this individual.

at the Candlewood Apartments. She advised that this is
the only record she could find of this individual and
stated that he must have paid his rent payments in cash.

advised that their records indicate BURGESS A. WILSON
was the complainant and victim of a strong-arm robbery
on August 7, 1975. BEARD advised that is the only record
they have of a BURGESS A. WILSON in their files.

Mr. WILLIAM DON GLADDEN, age 46, white male,
Route 3, Box 205-H-3 (Meadowlark Drive), Gulf Park Estates,
Ocean Springs, Mississippi (telephone number 875-3518), was
contacted at the Seasons and Reasons Gift Shop located at
2446 Highway 90 East, Ocean Springs, Mississippi (telephone
number 875-2531). Mr. GLADDEN furnished the following
information:

He is employed as the manager of the Social
Security Administration Office in Gulfport, Mississippi
(telephone number 896-3221), but also is owner of the above
noted gift shop along with his wife, ALICE A. GLADDEN,
GLADDEN advised that he and his wife opened the gift shop
in Ocean Springs on July 3, 1978.

On or about July 26, 1978, a man came to the gift
shop and identified himself as "Bill" WILSON. He talked with
GLADDEN's wife stating that he was getting ready to open a
watch repair business in the Edgewater Shopping Mall in
Biloxi, Mississippi, and wanted to use the GLADDEN's gift
shop as a pickup point for watches to be repaired. Mrs.
GLADDEN discussed the matter with her husband and he and
WILSON agreed approximately four or five days later to permit
WILSON to. rent repair shop space in the rear of GLADDEN's
gift shop.

According to GLADDEN, neither he nor his wife had
ever met WILSON before but he was a friendly outgoing
individual whonthey came to trust. He was a very good
worker and always was the first one to open the store in
the morning. WILSON paid his own money for a lot of radio
ads for his watch repair business. WILSON had some of his
own jewelry -and watch repair equipment but after moving into
GLADDEN's gift shop, spent several thousand dollars of his
own money for additional equipment. GLADDEN advised that
the only investment he (GLADDEN) had in the watch repair
effort was that he agreed to go in half with WILSON on an
$800 sign for the store.

GLADDEN again described WILSON as being a very
who was with customers and was

always trying to "drum up new business", According

to GLADDEN, all signs were that BILL WILSON was going to
stay with the gift shop as a watch repairman on a permanent
basis. After a few days, WILSON advised Mr. and Mrs.
GLADDEN that he had changed his mind about opening up

a watch and jewelry repair business in the Edgewater Mall,
Biloxi, Mississippi.

GLADDEN advised that neither he nor his wife
ever visited the WILSON residence in Ocean Springs but
it was their understanding that WILSON resided in Apartment
No. 9 at the Twin Pines Motel on Highway 90 in Ocean Springs
for several days after first arriving in town. Later
WILSON advised the GLADDENs that he had moved to a residence
located at Route 6, Box 387, Ocean Springs (telephone number
875-9542), GLADDEN advised that this residence apparently
is located on the Vancleave Road north of the Ocean Springs
Hospital, WILSON told the GLADDENs that the house is owned
by an unidentified friend who was letting him live there
in exchange for keeping the house in good repair.

GLADDEN advised that WILSON is an excellent pilot.
GLADDEN and his son flew with WILSON in a rented plane and
according to GLADDEN, WILSON appeared to know everything
about flying the plane and could handle it well in rough
weather, GLADDEN did not know the extent of WILSON's education
but described him as being an “extremely intelligent man".
WILSON would come and go in the shop every day and had numerous
advertising fliers printed up which he apparently hand
delivered in various businesses around the Ocean Springs area.

GLADDEN advised that sometime after WILSON began
working at his watch repair business in Ocean Springs, he
became aware that WILSON had a drinking problem. The drinking
problem, however, did not effect WILSON's work because he
would come into the shop early every morning and do all of
the watch repairs that were waiting for him and then he would
leave for the day. GLADDEN advised that one salesman (identity
unrecalled) who apparently had some céntact with WILSON
stated that WILSON told him that he had a drinking problem
but was trying to work hard at the watch repair business in
order to defeat this problem.

JN 62-544

On August 17, 1978, at around 11:45 p.m
WILSON telephoned ALICE GLADDEN at the GLADDEN residence
in Ocean Springs. He asked to speak to WILLIAM D. GLADDEN
who at that time was asleep. GLADDEN answered the phone and
WILSON told him that he had to seehim and his wife immediately
about a matter which would not wait until the morning. WILSON
refused to come to the GLADDEN residence and stated that
they should meet at the gift shop to discuss a matter of
"national urgency". GLADDEN stated that he became worried
at WILSON's insistance so besides his wife, he took his 18
year old son along and met WILSON at the gift shop at 12:15
aem. on August 18, 1978,

WILSON arrived at the gift shop at the appointed
time driving his old model blue Chevrolet with a white top
and unrecalled Louisiana license tags. He had been drinking
because his breath smelled of alcohol and his eyes were
extremely red; however, he did not talk like an intoxicated
person. He appeared very depressed according to GLADDEN.

WILSON opened the conversation by saying, “I am
the mystery man." When questioned by GLADDEN as to what
he meant by this remark WILSON said, "I am the man that
murdered Martin Luther King." GLADDEN advised that WILSON
then talked with him for the next hour and 15 minutes about
how he had grown up in Grenada, Mississippi, where his father
was a Baptist preacher, WILSON described how his father's
church was open for local blacks to worship in and they were
treated like neighbors, When the racial unrest was runnin:
rampant in the State of Mississippi in 1967 some “northern'
blacks came to the church escorted by FBI Agents. WILSON's
father welcomed them to the church only if they were not there
"for trouble", However, according to WILSON, they did come
for trouble and his father subsequently died of a heart attack
as a result of the racial unrest.

WILSON then stated again that, "I am the one that
pulled the trigger." He stated that the KING killing was
a conspiracy and that he was the logical one to pull the
trigger. WILSON told the GLADDENs that he had been with the
Government (not further described) and had been involved in
undeclared wars (not further described). WILSON also said that
he knew MARTIN LUTHER KING's father and brother and grew up
right next door to KING's cousin and knew the entire family.

NW 55186 Docld:32989768 Page 351



JN 62-544

(WILSON did not furnish the name of KING's cousin to the
GLADDENs. )

GLADDEN advised that WILSON told him that he had
purchased a white Mustang for his daughter and that it was
similar to a vehicle which GLADDEN had purchased for his
daughter in Ocean Springs. WILSON told GLADDEN that his
daughter had driven the white Mustang to Memphis, Tennessee,
just prior to the KING assassination. WILSON was supposed
to be in Kansas City, Missouri, at the time of the assassina-
tion and had alibis to prove it when actually he too was in
Memphis.

WILSON told GLADDEN that JAMES EARL RAY was the
"fall guy". He said that RAY only saw him twice but WILSON
knew who RAY was. RAY was suppos to have gotten away clean.
WILSON said that he was surprised that RAY has brought it
all back up again inasmuch as he (RAY) is probably due for
parole in about two years.

WILSON told GLADDEN, "You won't see me anymore
after tonight." He wanted the GLADDENs to have his watch
repair equipment. WILSON again insisted to the GLADDENs
that the KING assassination was a “group conspiracy".

WILSON stated that he would only deal with the "Sheriff

of Memphis, Tennessee, wom WILSON use to fly with", WILSON
also said that he felt the Government (not further described)
wanted the KING killing to happen and he (WILSON) knew it
needed to be done and did not expect to get much time for it.

WILSON told GLADDEN that he was not sorry he did
the KING killing since the "niggers are better off". Later
in their conversation WILSON did say he was sorry that he had
pulled the trigger.

WILSON told the GLADDENs that the Sheriff of Memphis
had talked to him on the telephone and had agreed to meet
WILSON in the Gulfport, Mississippi, Holiday Inn the mornin,
of August 18, 1978, WILSON speculated that he would probably
be allowed to have a television set in his cell and would
probably be allowed to repair watches or give instruction
in watch repair while in prison.

NW 55186 DocId:32989768 Page 352



JN 62-544

WILSON also told the GLADDENs that he fired the
shot that killed MARTIN LUTHER KING not from 50 yards but
from about 50 feet away and he saw the bullet hit. WILSON
said that, "I shot the shit out of him and saw it fly."
WILSON never mentioned the type of gun he used nor did he
soap hard GLADDENs the location from which he allegedly fired
the shot.

At one point during their conversation, WILSON
looked at GLADDEN's son who apparently appeared disturbed
by WILSON's revelations. WILSON told GLADDEN's son that he
could tell he did not approve of what he had done but that
he had better keep his nose out of it.

WILSON, who apparently had served in the U. S.
Air Force, indicated that he had worked in some type of
investigative work while in the military service.

WILSON kept bringing up the fact that he was
going to meet with the Sheriff of Memphis, Tennessee, the
morning of August 18, 1978, and even offered to furnish
GLADDEN this individual's name and telephone number if he
wanted it for verification. GLADDEN declined.

WILSON said that he had gone through 10 years of
hell because he killed KING, He said that it had ruined
26 years of a good marriage and now his conscience was bothering
him more than ever in the last few years.

WILSON referred to a sketch of the KING murder
suspect which apparently had been recently shown on television
and told GLADDEN that the sketch was almost an exact likeness
of him (WILSON).

WILSON said that he has a sister in Fulton,
Mississippi, who telephoned him in Ocean Springs after the
sketch was shown on television saying that the sketch looked
exactly like him. According to WILSON he called his sister
and other members of his family to let them know he was
turning himself in,

_ NW 55186 Docld:32989768 Page 353



JN 62-544

GLADDEN advised that at the end of their
conversation, WILSON left the gift shop and drove east
on Highway 90. GLADDEN feels sure that WILSON probably
drove to the Angular's Im Tavern which is located a
short distance from the gift shop and was apparently
frequented by WILSON.

GLADDEN advised that shortly before noon on

August 18, 1978, he was telephonically contacted by WILSON
who said that he was now at home and that he had been to

the Holiday Inn in Gulfport, Mississippi, accompanied by
"the father" (not further identified). The sheriff of
Memphis, Tennessee, had not shown up; however, there were
individuals there believed by WILSON to be FBI Agents, He
believed he had been betrayed and was now ready to "blow
anyone's head off who comes to my house except the father".
About three hours after this conversation WILSON walked into
GLADDEN's gift shop. He was clean and neat and told GLADDEN
that he apparently had been in touch with the FBI and that
the FBI was not going to do anything to him. According

to GLADDEN, WILSON indicated that he had worked out some
"bargain" with the FBI and now WILSON wanted to live a normal
routine life. He asked GLADDEN if he could continue working
in the watch repair business, GLADDEN advised WILSON that
he and his wife were seriously contemplating selling the
business and they would make no decision about retaining

im.

Outside the possibility that WILSON had a drinking
problem, GLADDEN observed nothing unusual about the person
and did not consider him to be "the typical psychopath".
GLADDEN stated that in his job as manager of the Social
Security Office he deals with a lot of people who have
mental problems, He does not fit WILSON into any of the
basoie pra of mental imparities that he has observed. He
recalled that he has heard a lot about WILSON's past life
but nothing about his activities within the past 10 years.
He recalled WILSON saying he had been married five times,
twice to the same woman, WILSON said that he had been on the
Mississippi Coast only for about three months even though he
grew up in the State of Mississippi.

NW 55186 DocId:32989768 Page 354

GLADDEN described WILSON as a white male, five
feet eight, medium build, 155 to 170 pounds, graying hair,
age 46, with a red ruddy complexion. WILSON is apparently
partial to vodka and Coca-Cola,

PARKER W. NEELY, 1814 Short Main Street, Columbus,
Mississippi, advised he did business until 1976 as the
Box 4-N Gun Shop. His business concerned gunsmithing.
NEELY's records reflect on July 17, 1975, B. A. WILSON, JR.,

Mrs. CHRISTINE (LEON) GUNTHARP was telephonicall
contacted at Fulton, Mississippi, telephone number 862-9355,
Mrs. GUNTHARP advised that she is the sister of BURGESS
AUDIE WILSON, JR., and resides at Route 1, Box 36, Fulton,
Mississippi.

Mrs. GUNTHARP advised that her brother BURGESS
AUDIE WILSON, JR., is commonly known as "Bill". Mrs. GUNTHARP
stated that she has another brother, ALLISON WILSON, age 50,
who resides in Reform, Alabama, Her sister LYDIA MC GAHEY
resides at 2008 East 8th Avenue North, Columbus, Mississippi,
telephone number 327=1141.

Mrs, GUNTHARP stated that she has had extremely
limited contact with "Bill" during the last 11 years since
her father's death. Mrs. GUNTHARP related that her father
B. A. WILSON, SR., was a Baptist minister in Grenada,
Mississippi, and died in 1967, Mrs. GUNTHARP stated that
it was agreed prior to her father's death that she, CHRISTINE,
would be named executrix of the will which would leave all of
B. A. WILSON's personal property to his wife LILLY who was
his second wife and stepmother to each of the children, Mrs.
GUNTHARP stated that her stepmother LILLY WILSON remained
alive until 1976 and during her life span from 1967 until 1976
she was extremely dependant upon others for assistance.

Mrs, GUNTHARP stated that she and her sister LYDIA were the
only children to show any concern for LILLY WILSON's needs.
GUNTHARP stated that she therefore handled the disbursement
of the WILSON estate in accordance with the interest of each
of the brothers and sisters, She stated that this created
hard feelings with the brothers since they did not feel as
though they were receiving an equitable share of the estate,
She advised that "Bill" seemed to be extremely upset over this
matter and, in fact, called the GUNTHARP residence on one
occasion several weeks ago stating that CHRISTINE had "killed"
her brother referring to ALLISON who resides in Reform,
Alabama. Mrs. GUNTHARP stated that she understood her brother
"Bill" to mean that her handling of the estate was responsible
for her brother ALLISON's death, Mrs. GUNTHARP stated that
ALLISON is alive and healthy and this statement by "Bill" was
totally incorrect. Mrs. GUNTHARP advised that her deceased

father tried to get help for "Bill" on a number of
occasions concerning "Bill's" alcoholic and mental
problem. Mrs. GUNTHARP stated that her brother is a
heavy drinker and tends to fabricate stories when under
the influence of alcohol. Mrs. GUNTHARP stated that
"Bill" will fabricate various types of stories to gain
attention. She recalled an incident whereupon she was
contacted by "Bill" just prior to entering the hospital
whereupon "Bill" told her that he was going to the
penitentiary. Mrs. GUNTHARP stated that this was totally
untrue.

Mrs. GUNTHARP explained that "Bill" entered the
United States Air Force by forging his father's signature
at age 14 or 15 and remained in the Air Force for almost
20 years, She advised that he served one tour in England
for approximately three years and resigned prior to
completing his 20-year tour. She described her brother
as being a very intelligent individual who was capable of
piloting planes and conducting a jewelry and watch repair
business. She advised that he had been involved in insurance
sales in the past.

Mrs. GUNTHARP advised that her brother has been
married five times and she has learned through family
conversations that her brother "Bill" told one of his

“was placed on 8 years probation by the 22nd Judicial District

Court, Comal County, for Theft Over $200 and Under $10,000.

The charge resulted from WILSON's taking a check for $2500

from a supposed business partner to Dallas, Texas, for the
purpose of purchasing stock for their jewelry store. WILSON

under the influence of alcohol and asked that his probation
be revoked. WILSON was incarcerated in the Comal County Jail.

Subsequent inquiry by ALLEN with the U.S. Secret

no value to that agency and that there was no counterfeiting
ring. After approximately three days of incarceration WILSON
i advised ALLEN that the reason he had requested his probation
be revoked was because he was seeking protection. He indicated
that he wanted his probation continued. By report dated
February 6, 1978, to the Probation Office, WILSON indicated
that he was residing at 113 Mill Street, San Marcos, Texas,

Church, Ocean Springs, Mississippi, was contacted at the
entrance of the Holiday Inn, U. S. Highway 90, Gulfport,
Mississippi, approximately 6:50 p.m. WILSON was advised

of the identity of SA BENJAMIN F. GRAVES and he was asked
if he were BURGESS AUDIE WILSON and he acknowledged that

he was WILSON and further stated that he was a junior.

WILSON was advised that Sheriff GENE BARKSDALE

however, FBI Agents were there and desired to talk with’
him, particularly about his daughter's supposedly having
driven a white Mustang from Kansas City, Missouri, to
Memphis, Tennessee, He stated he had no information to
furnish the FBI.

WILSON inquired as to whether or not he was under
arrest and he was advised that he was not under arrest.
WILSON commented he was not going to give anyone any trouble.
He was asked if he had any weapons on him and he stated he
did not and that SA GRAVES could search him if he so desired,
WILSON was then "patted down" and no weapons were felt on
his body.

WILSON commented that he and Father FANNON had been
to the motel at 9:30 a.m. on August 18, 1978, and again at
6:30 p.m. on August 18, 1978, to see Sheriff BARKSDALE and
the Sheriff had lied to them.

WILSON then asked Father FANNON if he would drive
him back to the place he had been picked up and Father FANNON
agreed to do so.

WILSON was again advised that FBI Agents were at the
motel and were still willing to talk with him and he reiterated
that he had nothing to say to the FBI and, as he departed,
commented that the FBI, in the past, had harassed his father
without any explanation.

Mr, WILLIAM DON GLADDEN, age 46, white male,
toute 3, Box 205-Iie3 (Meadowlark Drive), Gulf Park Estates,
Ocean Springs, Mississippi (telephone number 8753518), was
contacted at the Seasons and Reasons Gift Shop located at
2446 Highway 90 East, Ocean Springs, Mississippi (telephone

information:

He is employed as the manager of the Social
Security Administration Office in Gulfport, Mississippi
(telephone number 896-3221), but also is owner of the above
noted gift shop along with his wife, ALICE A. GLADDEN.
GLADDEN advised that he and. his wife opened the gift shop
in Ocean Springs on July 3, 1978.

On or about July 26, 1978, a man came to the gift
shop and identificd himself as "BALL" WILSON, He talked with
GLADDEN's wife stating that he was getting ready to open a
watch repair business in the Edgewater Shopping Mall in
Biloxi, Mississippi, and wanted to use the GLADDEN’s gift
shop ag a pickup point for watches to be repaired, Mise
GLADDEN discussed the matter with her husband and he and
WILSON agreed appx ately four or five days later to permit
WILSON to rent repair shop space in the rear of GLADDEN's
gift shop. -

According to GLADDEN, neither he nor his
ever met WILSON before but he was a friendly outgoing
individual whanthey came to trust. He was a very good
worker and always was the first one to open the store in
the morning. WILSON paid his own money for a lot of radio
ads for his watch repair business. WILSON had some of his
own jewelry and watch repair equipment but after moving into
GLADDEN's gift shop, spent several thousand dollars of his
own money for additional equipment. GLADDEN advised that
the only investment he (GLADDEN) had in the watch repair
effort was that he agreed to go in half with WILSON on an
$800 sign for the store. i"

always trying to “drum up new business", According

to GLADDEN, all signs were that BILL WILSON was going to
stay with the gift shop as a watch repairman on a permanent
basis. After a few days, WILSON advised Mr. and Hrs.
GLADDEN that he had changed his mind about opening up

a watch and jewelry repaix business in the Edgewater Mall,
Biloxi, Mississippi. :

GLADDEN advised that neither he nor his wife
ever visited the WILSON residence in Ocean Springs but
it was their understanding that WILSON xesided in Apartment
No, 9 at the Twin Pines Motel on Highway 90 in Ocean Springs
for several days after first arriving in town, Later
WILSON advised the GLADDENs that he had moved to a residence
Located at Route 6, Box 387, Ocean Springs (telephone number
875-9542), GLADDEN advised that this residence appaxently
is located on the Vancleave Road north of the Ocean Springs
Hospital. WILSON told the GLADDENs that the house is owned
by an unidentified friend who was letting him live there
im exchange for keeping the house in good repair.

GLADDEN advised that WILSON is an excellent pilot.
GLADDEN and his son flew with WILSON in a rented plane and
according to GLADDEN, WILSON appeared to know everything
about flying the plane and could handle it well in’ rough
weather. GLADDEN did not know the extent of WILSON's education
but described him as being an “extremely intelligent man",
WILSON would come and go in the shop every day and had numerous
advertising fliers princed up which he apparently hand
delivered in various businesses around the Ocean Springs area.

GLADDEN advised that sometime after WILSON began
working at his watch repair business in Ocean Springs, he
became aware that WILSON bad a drinking problem. ‘The drinking
problem, however, did not affect WILSON's work because he
would come into the shop early every morning and do all of
the watch repairs that were waiting for him and then he would
leave for the day, GLADDEN advised that one salesman (identity
unrecalled) who apparently had some cantact with WILSON
stated that WILSON told him that he had a drinking problem
but was trying to work hard at the watch repair business in
order to defeat this problem.

On August 17, 1978, at around 11:45 pome
WILSON telephoned ALICE GLADDEN at the GLADDEN residence
in Ocean Springs. He asked to speak to WILLISM D. GLADDEN
- who at that time was asleep. GLADDEN answered the phone and
WILSON told hha that he had to seehim and his wife immediately
about a matter which would not wait until the morning, WILSON
refused to coue to the GLADDEN residence and stated that
they should meet at the gift shop to discuss a matter of
“national urgency". GLADDEN stated that he became worried
at WILSON's insistence so besides his wife, he took his 18
year old son along and met WILSON at the gift shop at 12:15
aom. on August 18, 1978.

WILSON arrived at the gift shop at- the appointed
time driving his old model blue Chevrolet with a white top
and unrecalled Louisiana license tags. He had been drinking
because his breath smelled of alcohol and his eyes were
extremely red; however, he did not talk like an intoxicated
person, He appeared very depressed according to GLADDEN.

WILSON opened the conversation by saying, "I am
the mystery man." When questioned by GLADDEN as to what
he meant by this remark WILSON said, “I am the man that
murdered Martin Luther King." GLADDEN advised that WILSON
then talked with him for the next hour and 15 minutes about
how he had grown up in Grenada, Mississippi, where his father
was a Baptist preacher. WILSON described how his father's
church was open for local blacks to worship in and they were
treated like neighbors, When the racial unrest was rurmin,
rampant. in the State of Mississippi in 1967 some “northern
biacks came to the church escorted by FBI Agents. WILSON's
father welcomed them to the church only if they were not there
“for trouble", However, according to WILSON, they did come
for trouble and his father subsequently died of a heart attack
as a result of the racial unrest.

WILSON then stated again that, "I am the one that
. pulled the trigger." He stated that the KING killing was
a conspiracy and that he was the logical one to pull the
trigger. WILSON told the GLADDENs that he had been with the
Government (not further described) and had been involved in
undeclared waxs (not further described). WILSON also said that
he knew MARTIN LUTHER KING's father and brother and grew up
right next door to RING'’s cousin and kiew the entire family.

(WILSON did not furnish the name of KING's cousin to the
GLADDENs. )

GLADDEN advised that WILSON told him that he had

" purchased a white Mustang for his daughter and that it was

NW 55186

similar to a vehicle which GLADDEN had purchased for his
daughter in Ocean Springs. WILSON told GLADDEN that his
deughter had driven the white Mustang to Memphis, Tennessee,
just prior to the KING assassination, WILSON was supposed

to be in Kansas City, Missouri, at the time of the assassina=
tion and had alibis to prove it when actually hetco was in
Memphis. :

WILSON told GLADDEN that JAMES EARL RAY was the
“fall guy". He said that RAY only saw him twice but WILSON
knew who RAY was. RAY was supposed to have gotten away clean.
WILSON said that he was surprised that RAY has brought it
all back up again inasmuch as he (RAY) is probably due for
parole in about two years.

WILSON told GLADDEN, "You won't see me anymore
after tonight.” He wanted the GLADDENs to have his watch
repaix equipment. WILSON again insisted to the GLADDENs
that the KING assassination was a "group conspiracy’.

WILSON stated that he would only deal with the “Sheriff

of Memphis, Tenmessee, wiom WILSON usedto fly with”, WILSON
also said that he felt the Government (mot further described)
wanted the KING killing to happen and he (WILSON) knew it
needed to be done and Sid not expect to get much time for it.

WILSON told GLADDEN that he was not sorry he did
the KING killing since the “niggers are better off". Later
in their conversation WILSON did say he was sorry that he had
pulled the trigger.

WILSON told the GLADDENs that the Sheriff of Memphis
had talked to him on the telephone and had agreed to meet
WILSON in the Gulfport, Mississippi, Holiday Inn the morning
of August 18, 1978. WILSON speculated that he would probably
be allowed to have a television set in his cell and would
probably be allowed to repair watches or give instruction
in watch repair while in prison.

: WILSON also told the GLADDENs that he fired the
shot that killed MARTIN LUTHER KING not from 50 yards but
from about 50 feet away and he saw the bullet hit. WILSON
said that, “I shot the shit out of-him and saw it fly."

“ WILSON never mentioned the type of gun he used nor, did he
ae the GLADDENs the location from which he allegedly fired
the shot. :

At one point during their conversation, WILSON
looked at GLADBEN's son who apparently appeared disturbed
by WILSON's xevelations. WILSON told GLADDEN's son that he
could tell he did not approve of what he had done but that
he had better keep his nose out of it.

WILSON, who apparently had served in the U. S.
Air Force, indicated that he had worked in some type of
investigative work while in the military service.

WILSON kept bringing up the fact that he was
going to meet with the Sheriff of Memphis, Tennessee, the
morning of August 18, 1978, and even offered to furnish
GLADDEN this individual's name and telephone number if he
wanted it for verification. GLADDEN declined.

WILSON said that he had gone through 10 years of
hell because he killed KING. He said that it had ruined
26 years of a good marriage and now his conscience was bothering
him more than ever in the last few years.

: WILSON referred to a sketch of the KING murder
suspect which apparently had been recently shown on television
and told GLADDEN that the sketch was almost an exact likeness
of him (WILSON).

WILSON said that he has a sister in Fulton,
Mississippi, who telephoned him in Ocean Springs after the
sketch was shown on television saying that the sketch Looked
exactly like him, According to WILSON he called his sister
and other members of his family to let them know he was
turning himself in.

&

GLADDEN advised that at the end of their
conversation, WILSON left the gift shop and drove east
on Highway 90, GLADDEN feels sure that WILSON probably
drove to the Angular’s Inn Tavern which is located a

“short distance from the gift shop and was apparently
frequented by WILSON. :

GLADDEN advised that shortly before noon on

August 18, 1978, he was telephonically contacted by WILSON
who said that he was now at home and that he had been to

the Holiday Imm in Guifport, Mississippi, accompanied by,
"the father" (not further identified), The sheriff of
Memphis, Tennessee, had net shown ups; however, there were
individuals there believed by WILSON to be FBI Agents, He
believed he had been betrayed and was now ready to “blow
anyone's head off who comes to my house except the father".
About three hours after this conversation WILSON walked into
GLADDEN's gift shop. He was clean and neat and told GLADDEN
that he apparently had been in touch with the FBI and that
the FBI was not going to do anything to him. According

to GLADDEN, WILSON indicated that he had worked out some
“bargain" with the FBI and now WILSON wanted to live a normal
woutine life, He asked GLADDEN if he could continue working
in the watch repair business, GLADDEN advised WILSON that
he and his wife were seriously contemplating selling the
pusiaees and they would make no decision about retaining

im.

Outside the possibility that WILSON had a drinking
problem, GLADDEN observed nothing unusual about the person
and did not consider him to be “the typical psychopath",
GLADDEN stated that in his job as manager of the Social
Security Office he deals with a lot of people who have
mental problems, He does not fit WILSON into any of the
categories of mental imparities that he has observed. He
recalled that he has heard a lot about WILSON'’s past life
but nothing about his activities within the past 10 years.
He recalled WILSON saying he had been married five times,
twice to the same woman, WILSON said that he had been on the
Mississippi Coast only for about three months even though he
grew up in the State of Mississippi.

BURGESS AUDIE WILSON, JR., an inmate of the Ocean Springs
City Jail, Ocean Springs, Mississippi, furnished the following
information to ROYCE DAVID HIGNIGHT and K. P. WHITE-SPUNNER, JR.,
who he knows to be Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, after having been advised the purpose of the interview being
his knowledge and involvement in the murder of Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING
and after having been advised of his Constitutional rights which he
waived as indicated by an Advice of Rights and Waiver of Rights Form
which he signed:

Mr. WILSON advised that at the time prior to the murder of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, he was living in Grandview, Missouri, in a house
on Byers Road with his wife, BETTY LOU, and his three children,
DEBORAH, STEVE, and MARK. He was in the Air Force Reserve and also
operated a jewelry store.

In the course of his jewelry business, he met a white male
Italian who was in his late sixties and was approximately 5 feet 9
inches tall, weighed approximately 230 pounds, and who operated a
jewelry trade shop on Walnut Street. He stated that this white male
introduced him to another white male Italian by the name of MITCH
(Last Name Unknown), who was in his mid fifties and was approximately
5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighed approximately 190 pounds, who had
black, wavy hair and had some connection with a bonding company, and
also MITCH's brother, name not recalled, who fit the same physical
description as MITCH, but who had numerous cut scars on his face.

He stated that. MITCH ‘started delivering jewelry to him for
the purpose of having the stones removed from the fittings. He stated
MITCH usually met him at a bar on Walnut Street which was run by a
.white female and it. also appeared that MITCH might have been a part
owner or had an interest in this bar. He stated that due to the
volume of jewelry that MITCH was bringing to him, he asked MITCH

never said who put out the contract put said that he could get
the money for WILSON if he killed KING.

WILSON stated that MITCH was well aware of his, WILSON's,
, thoughts. concerning KING and the black civil rights movement, in
that his father, who was a pastor of the Central Baptist Church at
Grenada, Mississippi, died of a heart attack which he, WILSON,
thought was caused as a result of racial tensions at Grenada brought
on by the forceful integration of his father's church.

WILSON stated that approximately five or six months before
KING's murder, he started gathering information on the movements,
habits, and whereabouts of KING.

WILSON advised that he had a red and white Bonanza airplane,
Register Number 34L, and a Cessna 310 twin-engine aircraft, which was
blue and white, which planes he used to fly to different places
where KING was supposed to be. He stated that he recalls going to
Huntsville, Alabama; Tupelo, Mississippi; Jackson, Tennessee; Atlanta,
Georgia; and Greenville, South Carolina. He stated that while at
Tupelo, Mississippi, he stayed in the Ramada Inn and believes that
in the other places he visited he stayed in Holiday Inns.

He stated that MITCH furnished him a Japanese sniper rifle.
He stated that he kept the rifle and that just before Christmas of
1975, he had it reworked at a gunshop in Columbus, Mississippi, on
Fourth Street across from a bank. He stated that the last knowledge
he had-of the rifle, his older son, STEVEN WAYNE WILSON, had the
rifle and a shotgun but had told him that he had sold it.

Mr. WILSON advised that there was a garbage strike in
progress at Memphis, Tennessee, and that MITCH called him at his
store in Grandview, Missouri, and told him that KING was coming to
Memphis for.a rally and instructed WILSON to come to Memphis where

he was to meet two men at the Wonder Bar located at the corner of
Summer Avenue and White Station Road.

Mr. WILSON advised that he flew to Memphis, Tennessee,
in the Bonanza aircraft and landed at an airport just north of
Raleigh, Tennessee. He stated that the airport was operated by a
long-time acquaintance of. his who had attended a church which was
pastored -by WILSON's father in the past. WILSON stated that his
daughter, DEBORAH, picked him up at the airport’ in her 1965 white
Mustang, which WILSON had previously bought for her and which was
registered in his name in Missouri.

3095 Ruskin Road, Memphis, Tennessee. He stated that HOOTEN had had
a heart attack and that his wife and daughter were temporarily stay-
ing at the HOOTEN residence.

WILSON advised that he went to the Wonder Bar and while
having a drink two white men approached him, one having an accent
similar to a Puerto Rican.

The two white males furnished him with FBI credentials,
which he stated had a black and white photograph of himself on it,
and they took him and showed him where KING was to hold the rally.
They then took WILSON to a hotel on South Main Street near Beale
Street and took him to a room on the third floor. They told him
he was to be in the. crowd at the rally and that a decoy shot was to
be fired and that he was then to shoot. They said that KING had a
habit of raising his arms over his head when he was making a speech
and that the second time that he did so, the shots were to be fired.

WILSON stated that on the day of the murder he was in the
crowd standing near a wood fence approximately 60 feet from where
KING was standing and that when KING raised his arms the second time
he shot him.

Mr. WILSON advised that he had the rifle which he used
strapped to-his belt under a suit coat and attached to his belt on
a swivel,. He stated that the barrel protruded from below his coat
but no one questioned him concerning it. He said that he had prac-—
ticed a great deal swiveling the rifle and firing it.

He advised that after the shooting, he was stopped by the
Memphis police, but he showed them the. credentials, and they let
him go,.and he walked on down the street approximately two blocks
to where he had left the Mustang parked. He advised that he got
in the. Mustang and drove back: to the HOOTEN residence, and his
daughter, DEBORAH, then took him to the airport, and he got his
plane and flew back to Kansas City. He stated that the airport
that he used was on the Kansas side on the highway to Olathe,

by LOU CRUZ (phonetic). FORTNA stated that he knows LOU CRUZ
and that LOU CRUZ owned or still owns Lou Cruz Jewelry, 1505

also owned an identical Ford Thunderbird. WILSON left his
Thunderbird at the airport and flew to Memphis, Tennessee.
CRUZ came to the airport and picked up WILSON's Thunderbird
and took it from the airport so it would not be noticed.

When WILSON arrived in Memphis, he borrowed a white Ford
Mustang that he had purchased for his daughter, DEBORAH.
DEBORAH had driven from Kansas.City to Memphis in the Mustang.
WILSON told FORTNA that he went to the motel where MARTIN
LUTHER KING was staying and that he used a Japanese sniper
rifle and shot KING holding the rifle on his hip. He stated
that this rifle is now in the possession of WILSON's son,
STEVE. WILSON told FORTNA that he was driving away from the
scene in the Mustang, and he was stopped by the Memphis police,
but he talked himself out of a ticket, and the car was not
searched. He stated that the rifle was in the trunk of the
car at this time. WILSON told FORTNA that he then flew his
airplane back to Kansas City, and CRUZ picked him up at the
airport and took him home.

FORTNA stated that when WILSON told him the above
information, he, FORTNA, believed that WILSON thought he was
telling the truth and that he swore on his mother's grave in
front of a priest that it was the truth. FORTNA stated that
WILSON had never mentioned this subject prior to this instance.
FORTNA stated that WILSON has been drinking heavily for the
past two months and has lied to him several times in the past
two months. WILSON, on occasion, would tell FORTNA that he
had been married three or four times since divorcing his first
wife and then come back at a later date and say that he had
not been married after divorcing his first wife.

FORTINA stated that WILSON is an excellent pilot,
that he, FORTNA, has flown with WILSON through bad weather,
and WILSON had no problems flying the aircraft.

Columbus, Mississippi, revealed that this is the address
of the Candlewood Apartments.

JAMES LANCASTER, 810 Holland Avenue, advised
that he is the owner of the Candlewood Apartments.
LANCASTER stated that he does not recall anyone by the
name BURGESS AUDIE WILSON, JR., or BILL WILSON, renting
an apartment from him, LANCASTER advised, however, that
he has hada great cai of turnovers in these apartments
over the past several years and he could not possibly
recall all his tenants by name. LANCASTER advised
that his daughter, RITA BROWNLEE, was the resident
manager of the Candlewood Apartments for him for several
years. He stated that she might recall this individual.

AUDIE WILSON, JR., or BILL WILSON renting an apartment
from her. She stated, however, that she located a payment
from a BILL WILSON, dated July 16, 1975, for apartment #9
at the Candlewood Apartments. She advised that this is
the only record she could find of this individual and
stated that he must have paid his rent payments in cash.

DONALD BEARD, Columbus Police Department,
advised that their records indicate BURGESS A. WILSON
was the complainant and victim of a strong-arm robbery
on August 7, 1975, BEARD advised that is the only record
they have of a BURGESS A. WILSON in their files.

BEARD stated that they have a record of a BILL
WILSON, Apartment #9, Candlewood Apartments, as being
the subject of a disturbance call on August 7, 1975, and
again on August 13, 1975, BEARD advised that a review of
his records indicates that on both of these occasions another

Dear Don,

On October- 12, 1978, I recieved a letter from James Earl Ray requesting that
this Department cay to locate a motel that he stayed in or April 1, 1968. The
motel is supposed to be on Highway 72 in Corinth. I checked with the Southern
Motel and they have no record. I also checked with the Corona Plaza. They have
no record but the ownership has changed hands several times since 1968 and the
present owner is trying to locate the old records.

Enclosed you will find a copy of the letter and diagram of the location of
the motel, Also enclosed is a message from the National Sheriff's Association
addressed to Mr. Ray. .

Do you think there is any reason why we should check any further into this matter

since you checked all the motels in 1968?
If we can be of any assistance to you in the future, please feel free to call
on us.

ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
CIVIL RIGHTS :

On January 30, 1979, an anonymous woman caller
telephonicaYly furnished the following information to
Special Agent Udo H. Specht, FBI, Dallas, Texas:

She stated that an individual by the name of
son, residing at Boyd, Texas, in a brick house

responsible or somehow involved in the assassination of
Martin Luther King, Jr. She described Wilson as a white
male, 6', 180 pounds, 51 years of age, and a pipe welder

by trade. Wilson was involved in Ku Klux Klan activities
and lived in Greenville, Mississippi in 1968 and prior to
that. Prior to the assassination of King, Wilson allegedly
stated that he would kill or was going to kill Martin Luther
King. Wilson and another man, whom she would not identify,
were in Memphis the day King was assassinated. At that time,
Wilson owned a relatively new white Ford Mustang bearing “4
Mississippi license plates. After Wilson returned to
Greenville, Mississippi, from Memphis, Tennessee, he hid the
white Mustang for approximately one month.

l The caller stated that Wilson is an alcoholic and

| was during that time. He was drinking two and three quarts a

day. The caller stated that Wilson is mean and capable of murder,
especially. if he has been drinking.

The caller would not identify the other man who was in
Memphis with Wilson until she found out somehow that someone is
investigating what she is saying. :

On January 30, 1979, a telephone company information
operator advised that a C. H. Wilson is listed as residing in
Boyd, Texas, telephone number (817) 433-5105.

The Dallas, Texas FBI indices to investigatory records
did not reflect any information identifiable with C. H. Wilson.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of
the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your agency;
it and its contents are not to be distributed outside your agency.
