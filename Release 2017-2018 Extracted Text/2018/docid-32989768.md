To these questions, SA Sammon advised that he

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

At one point during the questioning,

when

SA Sammon was being questioned as to squad assignment

classifications,

and identities of Agents of the Miami,

Florida,

FBI Office from 1961-1964, SA Sammon advised

the committee that as that period of time was from

14-11 years in the past, sA Sammon would try to be as

accurate as possible as to months and years involved;

however, the committee was reminded SA Sammon's

recollection of the events may be six months to perhaps •

a year off. Mark Speiser advised SA Sammon that the

committee would only allow a four month leeway. This

comment may have been misunderstood by SA Sammon and

may have been in jest by Speiser; however, in any regard,

statement that events occurring 14-17 years ago would be

there would be no

on SA Sammon, unless the committee intended to furnish

him documentary verification.

There was no such

documentary verification furnished SA Sammon during

his interrogation, with the exception of SA Sammon

being furnished a

lengthy article from what appeared

to be the

"Parade" or pictorial section of the Miami,

Florida, Herald, Sunday Supplement Newspaper, which

article appeared to be regarding Bill Somerset.

This

article was furnished SA Sammon briefly in an effort

to identify Somerset by photograph as it appeared in

the article. sA sammon was unable to positively Identily

Somerset, due to the length of time involved, and the

fact that the photograph was not a good likeness, or

advised the committee that the

who was at the scene of the James Meredith

integration disorder at the University of Mississipi,

Oxford, Mississippi, which SA Sammon believed to

incident arose over Meredith, a Negro, attempting

to register to attend the University of MississippI.

C. Peterson contacted Bill Somerset for background

information on this individual and that Somerset

was acquainted with house painter and furnished

SA Peterson background intormation concerning this

individual, to the best of SA Sammon's recollection

involving the house painter being a member of

National States Rights Party (NSRP).

and not JAMES EARL RAY, had killed DR. MARTIN LUtHER KING.

The writer was instructed to make immediate arrangements

to thoroughly interview GLADEN.

The writer telephoned GLADDEN at his residence and arranged

to meet with GLADDEN there. GLADDEN advised he is employed as

Manager of the Social Security Office in Gulfport, Miss. (tel#

896-3221), but lives in the Gulf Park Estates area of Ocean

Springs. His house is the lst house on the left on Meadowlark

Dr, which is the second street to the right after passing the

golf course in Gulf Park 'Estates.

Thewriter and SA ROYCE D. HIGNIGHT were enroute to GLADDEN'S

residence when instructions were received from Gulfport SRA BEN

GRAVTS to discontinue.

Telephonic inquiry of SRA GRAVES determined FBI HQS had

instructed that no action be taken regardinz the foregoing.

GLADDEN was then telephonically advised the FBI apparently

was aware of information in WILSON'S possession and that no

interview of GLADDEN would be conducted.

did not have his adiress at time of this conversation with the

writer).

GIADDEN advised he became aware WILSON apparently has a

drinking problem. At 11:45 pm 8/17/70, WILSON telephoned GLADDEN

at home insisting he had urgent business to discuss with both

GLADDEN and his wife. VILSON

insisted he meet with the GlADDENS

immediately so they met at the gift shop at 12:15 am this date and

conversed for the next 12 hours. WILSON did not appear or act

like he was under the influence of alcohol. The GLADDEN'S 18 year

old son

was also present.

according to GLADDEN, WILSON furnished them details of how

he (WILSON) had killed DR. KING rather than JAMES EARL RAY.

GLADDEN stated he feels orr ather felt at the time, WILSON was

truthful in what he was telling them and that is why he promptly

contacted the FBI in Jackson.

No further details were asked of GLADDEN by thew riter and

he was advised he would

be recontacted in the event further

information was required.

GLADDEN advised he will probably terminate WILSON'S employment

as a result of this matter.

Per instructions of ASAC MURRAY, no further action being

taken.

WILSON telephoned ALICE GLADDEN at the GLADDEN residence

in Ocean Springs. He asked to speak to WILLIAM D. GLADDEN

then talked with him for the next hour and 15 minutes about

how he had grown up in Grenada, Mississippi, where his father

was a Baptist preacher.

WILSON described how his father's

church was open for local blacks to worship in and they were

treated like neighbors.

When the racial unrest was running

rampant in the State of Mississippi in 1967 some

"northern

a conspiracy and that he was the logical one to pull the

he knew MARTIN LUTHER KING's father and brother and grew up

right next door to KING's cousin and knew the entire family.

AT SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

On August 21, 1978, a review of court records, Bexar

was incarcerated for Contempt of Court growing out of a civil

suit entitled "Allison-Kaufmann

Company, a California corporation,

v. North Star Diamond Corporation (case number F248-084) of which

WILSON was listed as the owner.

This civil suit involved a fraud

case and WILSON was incarcerated following his refusal to furnish

the court with an inventory of merchandise in his possession

belonging to Allison-Kaufmann Company. This incarceration did

not involve any action growing out of child support.

The following investigation was conducted by Special

Agent WAYNE SMITH:

• AT SAN MARCOS, TEXAS

On August 19, 1978, JO ANN CHILDRESS, 113 Mill, San

Marcos, Texas, advised

that she met BURGESS AUDIE WILSON, JR.,

also known as

Bill Wilson, at Sadler, Texas, in September, 1977,

and they were married in November of

1977.

They separated

February 15, 1978 and the divorce was finalized on April 26, 1978.

On August 12, 1978, she received a telephonic message from WILSON

indicating that he was in the state of Tennessee and was involved

in an automobile accident.

WILSON stated that as a result of

this accident both of his legs were amputated. CHILDRESS advised

that WILSON is a "very convincing liar and a con-man". He has

never mentioned the death of MARTIN LUTHER KING and has never dis-

played any hatred or dislike for members of the black race.

According to CHILDRESS, she believes that WILSON was in the

United States Army during 1968, and WILSON has stated that

he was a Prisoner Of War (POW)

during the Vietnam conflict.

She is aware that WILSON visited the Veterans Administration

(VA) Hospital in San Antonio, Texas on several occasions, but

she possesses no knowledge of him suffering from any psychiatric

problems.

By previous marriage, WILSON has three children, two

sons and one daughter, locations not known by CHILDRESS.

WILSON arrived at the gift shop at the appointed

time driving his old

extremely red; however, he did not talk like an intoxicated

person

He appeared very depressed according to GLADDEN.

WILSON

opened the conversation by saying. "I am

the mystery man."

When questioned by GLADDEN as to what

he meant by this remark WILSON

said,

"I am the man that

murdered Martin Luther King."

GLADDEN advised that WILSON

then talked with him for the next hour and 15 minutes about

how he had grown up in Grenada, Mississippi, where his father

was a Baptist preacher. WILSON described how his father's

church was open for local blacks to worship in and they were

treated. like neighbors.

When the racial unrest was ruring

rampant in the State of Mississippi in 1967 some "northern

blacks came to the church escorted by FBI Agents. WILSON'S

father welcomed them to the church only if they were not there

"for trouble"

However, according to WIlson, they did come

tor trouble and his father subsequently died

of a heart attack

as a result of the racial

unrest

WILSON then stated again that,

"I am the one that

pulled the trigger.

He stated that the KING killing was

a conspiracy and that he was the logical one to pull the

trigger.

WILSON told the GLADDENs that he had been with the

Government (not further described) and

had been involved in

undeclared wars (not further described).

WILSON also said that

he knew MARTIN LUTHER KING's father and brother and grew up

right next door: to KING's cousin and knew the entire family.

Dear Don,

On October 12, 1978, I recieved a letter from James Earl Ray requesting that

this Department try to locate a motel that he stayed In or April 1, 1968. The

motel is supposed to be on Highway 72 in Corinth. I checked with the Southern

Motel and they have no record. I also checked with the Corona Plaza. They have

no record but the ownership has changed hands several times since 1968 and the

present owner is trying to locate the old records.

Enclosed you will find a copy of the letter and diagram of the location of

the motel. Also enclosed is a message from the National Sheriff's Association

addressed to Mr. Ray.

Do you think there is any reason why we should check any further into this matter

since you checked all the motels in 1968?

If we can be of any assistance to you in the future, please feel free to call

on us.

With kindness and best regards,

ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

CIVIL RIGHTS

On January 30, 1979, an anonymous woman caller

telephonically furnished the following information to

• Agent Udo H. Specht, FBI, Dallas, Texas:

I she stated that an individual by the name of

C. H. Wilson, residing at Boyd, Texas, in a brick house

on the road between Boyd and Azle, Texas, might have been

responsible or somehow involvea in the assassination of

Martin Luther King, JI.

She described Wilson as a white

male, 6', 180 pounds, 51 years of age, and a pipe welder

by trade.

Wilson was involved in Ku Klux Klan activities

I lived in Greenville, Mississippi in 1968 and prior to

that.

Prior to the assassination of King, Wilson allegedly

stated that he would kill or was going to kill Martin Luther

King.

Wilson and another man, whom she would not identify,

were in Memphis the day King was assassinated. At that time,

Wilson owned a relatively new white Ford Mustang bearing

Mississippi license plates.

After Wilson returned to

Greenville, Mississippi, from Memphis, Tennessee, he hid the

white Mustang for approximately one month.

The caller stated that wilson is an alcoholic and

was during that time.

He was drinking two and three quarts a

day.

The caller stated that Wilson is mean and capable of murder,

especially. if he has been drinking.

The caller would not identify the other man who was in

Memphis with Wilson until she found out somehow that someone is

investigating what she is saying.

On January 30, 1979, a telephone company information

operator advised that a

C. H. Wilson is listed as residing in

Boya, Texas, telephone number (817) 433-5105.

The Dallas, Texas FBI indices to investigatory records

did not reflect any information identifiable with C. H. Wilson.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of

the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to your agency;

it and its contents are not to be distributed outside your agency.
