CIA anticipates that

Castro will give it little attention and regard it only as

another organization of exiles.

list is enclosed herewith.

Teague of the Miami office.

Liaison has previously reported that ClA would be

utilizing Swan Island located in the Gulf of Mexico for the

mounting of a radio broadcasting operation.

Broadcasts will, of

course

be directed against castro and will be beamed to cuba.

Broadcasts are to be initiated on or about 5-19-60.(0GR1u)

CIA is spending considerable time and effort to bring

certain

anti-Castro Cubans outside of Cuba so that they can be

utilized in this operation.

This is being done on a selective

basis in an effort to obtain the services of certain key men.(beDCd):

You previously have been informed that a Cuban who is

held in high regard by CIA and apparently was to be utilized in

this operation was Colonel Ramon Barquin.

This individual is still

connected with the Castro Government and is assigned to an Embassy

abroad.

According tol

Barquin has not been able to make

a clean

I break with Castro because of action which might be taken

against members of his family in Cuba. He now feels that he has

this matter under control and CIA thinks that he will officially

severe his connections with Castro within the next few weeks. He

could become a key figure in FRD. To 1X51

The headquarters

of FRD will be reported as being in

Cuba and will exist in that country in a clandestine status.

Branches

will be established in various Latin American countries, and in the

United States.

Costa Rica undoubtedly will be a key location.

CIA does not plan to utilize a large number of Cubans for this

operation.

There pobably will not be more than 40 or 50 who will

have been briefed and trained by ClA. This group, however, will

be engaged in a program of training

outside of the U.S.

There is a plan to use a U.S. base in the Panama Canal zone for

some of this training.
