7. Subject said that he had Called the head of vorid hide Information
Services, Richard w. Hzbell, since he was in Washington anyway and proposed
to go to New York to see hin. He said while Me was in New York he would

attenat to contact Loos (See my mencrandun of 7 July) and learn more of the

“alleged 1,00) availabie Cerrans.. I told-him that I neither approved or

disappreved his taking this action at this time but if he did, I would
appreciate hearing the results of it. : :

@, Subject said that he feels he should return to the Dominican
Republic as soon as possible and asked if we vere willing to finance such
atrip. I told him it would be necessary to get his clearance before
doing so, and that he would bear fron us in a week to 10 days.

9. My secand interview with Subject gave me a more unfavorable
opinion than before. While obviously’ capable, I get the inpression that
Subject is such a big “wheeler and dealer’gthat he has fatlea in business

despite considerable ability, initiative and energy. I recommend that

mo use be wade of him until such time that a very careful covert inveati-
gation of his background and activities have been made? that if security

approval is obtained, he initially be hired under a short tern contract

” tor testing purcoses/ and only after careful testing and evaluation should

he be considered for long term contract employment. (en
