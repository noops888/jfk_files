Io I phoned Subject at his botel on 8 Jily at 1100 as ve had pre-

arranged to erate another neeting with him. I told him that it would

only taie about an hour, of an hour and a half and then le would be free

to return to his home.

2, When I arriged I told hin that after looking over the situation

and consulting with ty supersore a i for obvious reasona

the United States would not support any revolutionary activities by Gen.

Pedraza. I also said that the United Staies will coserve 1ts International

obligatiorsconcerning Cuba and Pedraza, and that the United States would

not overicok any violations by Pedraza or his followers of the neutrality

laws.

3. I said that we had some interest in the possibility of his

working for us as an intelligence gatherer under terms to be negotlated

after we obtained a current security clearance on him. I pointed out

that we were not attempting to limit his action in connection with the

nor were we assuming any responsibility for those

matters he carries out in his own behalf. I stressed the need for

security and discipline should he work for us, pointing out that he may

be asked to do things which we cannot fully explain to him because of

the need for security. He said he understood this perfectly. I dictated

the attached Secrecy Agreement to him and had him sign 1t.

Io I had taken with me a PRA Part 1 form and obiained the

necessary data.

for taking sif risks and switching

employment frequently. He appears to be basically a promoter in the

Piblic Relations ard Adrertising 'Fleld. In 1957, the fira Mitchell

VER BELL, Inco, Atlanta, Gecrgla, engared in pablie relations and

advertion, went throuth tankrupter, me has since been delhemployed

primarily as a consultant in the publie relations and advertising field.

He 19 also connected with a firm called world vide Information Services,

600 Ist Ave., New Xork. judging from the address, I questlorfl the

streng*" of this firmand Although Subject claims to be a Vice President

of it, he adaitted that he 1s emsloyed on a comissiorell basis and has

had no carsings since January 1959. he said the reason for his failure

to make ails money during this period 1s that he has been Involved in the

transactiong mentloned in my earlier metonandu) the exchanie of Cuban

pesos, which were largely unsuccessful.

6. I had asked Sibject to write out in detail as much as possible

of the story he had given me on 6 July, but he had failed to do so. He

wanted to knoa whether the United States Covernment was going to do any-

thing about what he called the serious Communist crisis in Cuba. I

toid him that the United States would handle the matter in its own way

and at own time and that for obvious reasons of security i could not go

Into any detail on any of these matters with his inless he were specifically

7. Subject said that te had alled the head of forld.hide Informazion

ferrices, Pichard ii. Hibell, since he was in lashington anyway and proposed

¿0 go to New York to see him." He said while le was In New Jork he would

attesat to contact loos (See my memorandur of 7 July) and learn more of the

alleged 1,00 availabie Gergans.. I told hin that I neither approved or

disapproved his taking this action at this time but 1f he did; I would

appreciate hearing the results of it.

fo Subject said that he feels he should return to the Dominican

Republie as soon as possible and asked 11 we were willing to finance such

a Erip. I toid him it would be necessary to get his clearance before

doize 50, and that he would hear fron us in a week to 10 dajs.

9. My secand Interview with Subject gave me a more unfavorable

opinion than before. while obviously, capable, I get the Impreasion that

Subject is such a big "wheeler and dealer" that he has failed in business

despite considersue ability, initiative and energy. I recommend that

ne use be nade of him until such time that a very careñil covere invart.l

gation of his background and actlvities have been made; that if security

approval 1s obtained, he initially be hired under a short ter contract

for testing pursoses," ard only after careful testing and evaluation should

he be considered for long term contract employment.
