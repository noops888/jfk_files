1. Much has been written about the dela (by. the Mexico 1

name Lee OSWALD. [t was discussed in Dave Phillips book as a
case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which
in ny view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know wat he was’ talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October
conversation would have been picked up on the morning<of.

3. Later the film was en out of the camera every day

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 untii

developed a support apparatus. to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTIER Gres of multi ine

Telephone taps (ER go by an employee of the local

telephone company wi se by a Station case officer. The number
of lines tapped wa ted only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

- American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer
assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. - The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest ‘corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double ltaned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
‘on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site wee middle of
the block south. It had a planted view of t!

row of four houses on the sousyeg NO he Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked th Sy of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this operi ae get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processedon the outside by a recruited agent. :

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
‘interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for H
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral SS aPcept operation, |

LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American SS A recruited

Mexican agent, who had a semiofficial a) ae selected letters

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. Their agents were wsiedcteZchde, and corrupt. A Station
officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In
1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a Joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. . The operation, which became known as _

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines
connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican
Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-
"cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post.
3. Oswald Coverage:
In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the et listening

taps. The Mexicans ac ‘ter connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czeth lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

for translation and ‘typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here a > there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up a week

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-
ficulties.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F, Dulles)
was energetic in organizing groups to “fight conmmisn". One of these seeds ‘
grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former Nexi President), acting a

project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown,

The Mexican in. control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, end greedy. His

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected, However,
ries recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cubon lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,
2 Polish, end 1 Yugoslav line, The basebouse Listening post had a live
monitor who nade short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily H

full transcripts were typed and passed to the stetion in the seme vay, however,
there was usually e time lag of a day or so, Those transcripts which hdd

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hena*(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly * this man
(the American), “> showed him a letter imWhichhe*(the
American) is a member of an organizati¢h iit

the Russian visa and now the § org loesn't know what to do

Washington. ave (Ss

DURAN: with them also, be Sieh yroblem with him (the American)

is that he doesnt (sariyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very sk ve him a visa, because he was

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take wfong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~" “now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can commmicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Consulate 15-60-55 PROGIBITED

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Enbassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
Anerica, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
Imow what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping:tepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA, and needed routine visa information,»’First
a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned outeto ‘be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthe address. After
making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went madres to get the needed
information.) .

+ Ttem 395, pages 7 and 8 .

Just after 1600 hours, S Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her.name and
someone will-return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and
has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
: Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
in order to change that address and asks for the name
of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

WASHINGTON
—The Central Intelli-

Vital intelligence infor-
mation from the Warren
Commission during its in-

all documents that might
shed light on the assas-
sination, CIA authorities
failed to turn over a na-
tional intelligence esti
mate warning that it is

clals who actively oppose
“Soviet policies.

Titled “Soviet Strategic
Executive Action,” the
Suppressed CIA’ docu-
ment went into the shock-

been passed to me for reply,

2, Paragraph three of your letter requested the Agency
to supply the Commission with a report on information in the
Agency's possession regarding Lee Harvey CSWALD oriar to
November 22, 1963, The request was predicated upon the
footnote on page two of CIA's report to the Commission dated
31 January 1964, entitled: Information Developed by CIA on
the Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City, 23 Sep-
tember = 3 October 1963",

3, There is attached an exact reproduction of the i
Agency's official dossier on Lee Harvey OSWALD beginning
with the opening sheet dated 9 December 1960, The entire
dossier carries the security classification of Secret and
consists of thirty documents arranged in chronological order.
Cn the basis of clearances from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Department of State, the Department of
Navy, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who
were queried by us after the receipt of your letter, we are
able to make available exact copies of all materials in the

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some.) 0.0.
‘from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though GIA and the 29
FEL have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited
as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be
a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries
who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCID h/2, ©: ;
these persons might be described as those who have either been, an
capable of providing useful intelligencé to the Bloc or those whose
desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited -*
for communist propaganda purposes. This would mean that no attention :
need be paid to Anericans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular *.,
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual
US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the
"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into 7"! !
the American society. .

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the lest 18
months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
possibly expand this List for the use of interested Bureaus of. the
Department. : Bs

Sincerely yours,

We have been told the solice-fivn' t ‘ani

we finally got access to hin

authority to move in wei ay so those questions were not covered.

With regard to B - ties, ‘Paine, etc., ve are working on that.
_E - ve have some information for you on that indicating communication
between him and the Embassy up there.

‘the vite is being interrogated. I don't mow if that took place yesterd:
or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I em

Just giving you a preview.

With regard to that, Nicareguan‘s; allegations that the man was in the
Cuban Embassy on 18 September, I undérstand we do have information that
he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of September. There is a
record showing entry into Mexico on September 26. On about the 15th he
applied in Nev Orleans for a tourist cad. We do know he was in -

I may even have some later inf wii

P j} He vas seen onthe, 2 je landlady said he skipped during the night.
ys
He was last seen by the landlady . Now we have immigration records showing him

entering Mexico’on the 26th vhich very strongly suggests that he was not in Mexico
on the 18th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day -

the 25th, 2kth, and all the way back. I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
