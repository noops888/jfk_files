PROPOSED MEETING WITH CONGRESSMAN JOHN ROWLAND (R-CT) esl dee

MEMBER HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

(APSCT)

Ca

PURPOSE: To advise of a tentatively scheduled meeting with
Congressman ROWLAND and to seek the DIRECTOR's approval for the
meeting.

DETAILS: On 8/10/89, Congressman ROWLAND, who was appointed to
HPSCI in January, 1989, visited the New York Office to learn more of
the FBI's effort in counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and drug
enforcement. During that visit, legislative initiatives were
discussed. There was not, however, sufficient time to discuss
counterintelligence legislative proposals. Congressman ROWLAND thus
asked the Congressional Affairs Office (CAO) representative if a
follow-up meeting could be scheduled to discuss the FBI's counter-
intelligence legislative needs in September, 1989.

A briefing has tentatively been scheduled for 9/20/89 at
11 a.m. in Room H405 - Capitol.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. That SSAs MONTE C. STRAIT and JOHN S.
HOOKS, dJr., ae vk brief Congressman ROWLAND on 9/20/89 at 11 a.m.

SECRET

Memorandum from Mr. J. M. Sturgis

to Mr. W. O. Cregar

Re: Report on Allegations Appearing in
October 14 - 15, 1979, Editions of

The Chicago Sun-Times Newspaper

DETAILS:

On 1/3/80, SAs Emil Moschella, Legal Counsel
Division, and Jim Sturgis, Intelligence Division, met with
Thomas Lattemer, Staff Director, House Permanent Committee
on Intelligence, at his request, regarding the recent FBI
submission to the Committee of a review on analysis of the
case captioned "Report on Allegations Appearing in the
October 14, 15, 1979, Editions of the Chicago 'Sun-Times'
Newspaper; Review of Pending Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) Double Agent Operations, October 1, 1977, to the
President.’ It is noted that the Committee had taken
testimony on the matter of this double agent on October 16,
1979, and the Committee made several requests for information
in the area. (S)

Mr. Lattemer advised that it was the opinion of
one of the members that a piece of requested information
had not been directly addressed in our response and he
therefore made a request for the specific item. Mr. Lattemer
said that the item appears on pages 34 - 35 of the hearing
transcript and that the requested analysis should compare all
of the items passed by the double agent over the term of his
operation with the information received by the FBI from the
double agent so that one may be weighed against the other
in a kind of "cost/benefit ratio." (S)

Mr. Lattemer requested that the analysis be in his
hands prior to the first Committee meeting which is scheduled
for 1/23/80. (Cc)

MEMORANDUM TO MESSRS. ADAMS
MC DERMOTT
o , Co
Ir Prior to the closed session meeting of the House.”
Intelligence Committee at 3:30 p.m. this afternoon I advised
the Attorney General that, as a result of the recent
inspegzion of the New York Office, we had discovered that
som wiretap records were not kept in accordance with regula-
tions with the result that the indices may have been in-
complete at the time that affidavits were submitted on the
question of whether various individuals had or had not been
overheard during such taps. I told him that our tentative
assessment was that we would find very few additional names
but that it would take considerable effort to nail it dow.

This prompted the Attorney General to tell me that
he understood Mr. LaPrade had testified or been interviewed
on the Hill regarding his foreign counterintelligence concerns
and at that time described a procedure which worried him. He -—
stated that in making€aps on Telex lines the company (RCA)
would not cooperate and it was therefore necessary for the ({.
Special Agent to run tests on various lines until he found ~—
the Telex. Judge Bell drew the inference that the Agents
necessarily had to overhear conversations or messages on other
Lines during this testing process, E understand from you that
this may not be the case. We ShomtWlascertain exactly what

the practice is and what the problems "Ge i >

DETAILS;

During early February, 1978, an appearance by either
Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams or Assistant Director
Y. W. Leavitt is planned before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence;
in addition, the House Select Committee on Intelligence will be similarly
briefed in the near future. In order to dramatize graphically the constant
threat to national security posed by Hostile Intelligence Services, a video-
tape presentation of approximately 20 minutes is felt to be most desirable.
Senate staff members have specifically requested such a film as one of
the most effective ways to dramatize our problems for the Senators.

At the present time, the Instructional Technological Services
Staff, Training Division, have advised the Intelligence Division (INTD)
they have a nuraber of important projects; but, in view of the short dead~-

PURPOSE: 1, Ae : :

¢
To confirm Director’ 8 authorization to} prepare hand-painted
FBI seal suitable for mounting on wall of the hearing room (H-405) of
the HSCI.

DETAILS:

During testimony befgre the HSCI on 1/19/78, the Committee
Chairman, Rep. Edward P. Boland, requested that I arrange for an FBI
seal to be placed on the wall together with the seals of the other five
members of the Intelligence Community which are already there.

The seals of the other agencies are all 15" in diameter.
Available FBI seals are either 9" (all gold) or 21" (full color) in diameter.
The Director orally authorized the hand painting of a 9'' seal to be mounted
on a 15" wooden base appropriately finished. The Special Projects Section,
Laboratory Division, has observed seals now in the hearing room and can
prepare a suitable FBI seal and base.

To obtain a 15'' seal presenting an appearance more comparable ~

et y to the other seals through regular channels would be prohibitively expensive.

5}

AR
~qv

Making a mold, alone, would cost about $1,000. However, a hand-carved
15" seal can be made in the Philippines through Legat, Manila. The cost
would probably run less than $50. The time to obtain would run 60-90 days
and it is, therefore, not a viable alternative to installing, initially, the

9" seal on 15" base but offers a better long-range solution to the HSCT
Chairman's request. %

of the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 and in keeping with the
spirit of this Act, the request shall be accompanied by
a statement signed by the subject of the investigation
acknowledging that he or she has consented to the
investigation with the knowledge that facts or information

information disclosing a medical problem or if such
information is developed through investigation, the FBI

further investigation is desired and will either furnish
to the FBI a release to review necessary medical records
and interview the physician or advise if it desires the
FBI to contact the persons under investigation for the
appropriate medical releases.

interviewed during these investigations may be assured that
to the extent permitted by law information identifying such
persons will be kept confidential.

The FBI will furnish summary memoranda and supporting
materials containing the results of its investigation to
the Committee Chairman or his designated representative
and retain a record of the person to whom such information
is furnished. The Committee Chairman will insure that

identities of persons receiving access to the aforementioned
materials and such records shall be furnished to the FBI
upon request. The HPSCI shall not reproduce or disseminate
any of the aforementioned materials without the express
consent of the FBI unless otherwise provided for in this
agreement.

The Chairman will insure that summary memoranda and
supporting materials and any copies will be destroyed within
ninety (90) days of their receipt unless written notice
has been given to the Director that an additional period
of time, not exceeding ninety (90) days, is needed to
complete a decision relating to employment or clearance.

The Chairman will. notify the Director of the FBI when
these materials have been destroyed pursuant to this
paragraph.

Under no circumstances should the HPSCI allow the
person who is the subject of an investigation direct access
to the summary memorandum and supporting material. If
necessary to discuss the contents of the summary memorandum
and supporting material with the applicant or employee the
HPSCI will insure that the confidentiality of the sources
contained therein is protected. Any request by the
individual for access to the memorandum will be referred |
to the FBI for processing in accordance with the Privacy

from a Federal agency for background information concerning
a current employee or contractor of the HPSCI, if the
individual concerned has given written consent authorizing
the HPSCI to be notified, the FBI will notify the HPSCI
of the request for background information, except where
the request concerns the individual's employment applica-
tion to the agency requesting the background information.
Notification by the FBI to the HPSCI will not extend to a
criminal or national security investigation until it is
determined ‘that notification would not impede or compromise
the investigation.

Legal Counsel to the Associate Director Memo
RE: HOUSE RESOLUTION 82
95TH CONGRESS, FIRST SESSION

Page 9, line 1, of this Resolution provides 'that the head of
any department or agency of the United States involved in any intelligence
activities should furnish any information or document in the possession,
custody, or control of the department or agency, or person paid by such
department or agency whenever requested by the select committee with
respect to any matter within such committee's jurisdiction." It should be
noted that Senate Resolution 400, 94th Congress, Second Session, was
silent regarding this type of access. This Select Committee would also
look into the desirability of establishing a standing committee of the House
on Intelligence Activities, the desirability of establishing a joint committee _
of the Senate and the House of Representatives on intelligence activities, or .
of establishing procedures under which separate committee on intelligence
activities of the two Houses of Congress would receive joint briefings by
the intelligence agencies and coordinate their policies with respect to
safeguarding of sensitive intelligence information.

This Resolution was referred to the Committee on Rules for
consideration.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Office of Congressional Affairs, Legal Counsel Division,
will follow the deliberations concerning the creation of the House Select

Committee on intelligence.

Houstudy is the code word assigned to the eae
fontrol file containing communications pertaining to
‘requests made by the House Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities.

By memorandum 6/11/75, which was approved, it was
recommended that, for purposes of sensitivity and urgency in
handling, the Bureau file relating to the captioned matter be
maintained in the work area of personnel assigned to the
Houstudy Project; presently room 3859. It is noted that the
above arrangement must be reevaluated and recommendations
submitted on a semiannual basis. The approval was thus
updated by memoranda dated 12/4/75 and 6/1/76.

‘

For reasons cited above, maintenance of the above
file as indicated has proven to be of invaluable assistance
to personnel assigned to the Project and to others having
frequent need for review of the file. Therefore, it is
recommended that the above arrangment be continued for an
additional 6-month period or until such time as the need no
longer exists.

PURPOSE: To advise of CIA request for permission “to cae
during Congressional hearing FBI inquiry of Pike Committee
Report leak to newsman Daniel Schorr; and our response to CIA
that we prefer they do not volunteer such information.

PE POR
'

DETAILS: House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
(Ethics Committee) has been’conducting public hearings to
determine source of leak which resulted in Daniel Schorr, CBS
news commentator, providing “The Village Voice," New York City
tabloid, information from House Intelligence Committee (Pike
Committee) Report. On 7/21/76, Steve Hunt, CIA, telephonically
advised S. F. Phillips, HOUSTUDY Project, that Seymour Bolten of
CIA Review Staff and Mitchell Rogovin, formerly Special Counsel
for Director, Central Intelligence, are to testify week of
7/25/76 at public hearings of Ethics Committee.

MISE ~

“

From questions already asked 6f other witnesses, it-
is anticipated Bolten and Rogovin will be asked if CIA investi-
gated the leak to Schorr. They intend to reply that CIA did
not as it is not provided for in its charter; but would like to
add a statement to the effect that the FBI has conducted such
investigation. Hunt sought Bureau approval for this. On 7/23/76,
Bolten telephoned Phillips and expanded request by stating that
the question which may be put to him or to Rogovin, may be of a
general nature, such as "Did anyone in the Executive Branch
investigate this matter?"; or, "Do you know of anyone who
investigated this matter?" In answer to such a general questio:
Bolten desired to be able to respond to the effect that the FBI)
has. conducted faves gi ation in this matter.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: HOUSTUDY

Pursuant to Department letter 2/13/76, “Disclosure
and Publication of Allegedly Classified Information by "The
Village Voice," on or about 2/11/76," we have been conducting
a preliminary inquiry in this matter along lines specified by
the Department. After conferring with Messrs. J. B. Adams and
J. A. Mintz, it was decided that CIA be told that we would
prefer that mention of FBI not be volunteered by Bolten or
Rogovin. However, if questioned specifically as to any FBI
investigation or if asked such general questions as indicated
above, we would have no objection to the following reply: "It
is our understanding that the FBI, at the instructions of the
Department of Justice, initiated a preliminary inquiry into
this matter in February, 1976."

The foregoing was telephonically passed by Phillips
> to Hunt, in Bolten's absence, on 7/23/76. The desired reply in
quotes immediately above was read to Hunt who reread it back
for accuracy. He expressed agreement with the handling of the
matter in this manner and expressed appreciation for our
cooperation.

This memorandum provides for filing of voluminous’ **

Select Committee on Intelligence Activities use).

Since the inception of the HOUSTUDY Project, we have S
accumulated 3 thick folders containing newspaper and wire service,,
clippings plus some additional material such as magazine articles’
and other public source data. Material maintained in tickler SS
folder, Sub A file was never opened. Retained material is in t
general, but not precise chronological order. With the end of the‘
HSC mandate, it is believed we should now provide for the final ang

SS

permanent retention of this material.

This matter was discussed by writer with ee
W. L. Bailey and L. W. Brady of the Records Management Division
on 6/29/76 and it was agreed that the most practical manner of
handling would be to file this material as a bulky enclosure
behind file and that no indexing would be necessary. Further,
that the original of this memorandum be filed in the main
HOUSTUDY file, 62-116464, and a copy be filed in Sub A
to 62-116464 which should be opened as a repository of it alone.
The presence of a copy of instant memorandum in the Sub A will

JEK Act 6 (1) (B)

DETAILS:

— On 5/18/76 Mr, August Fipp, investigator for the Standards of
Official Conduct Committee of the House, interviewed you and me in your
office concerning the Bureau's handling of the first version of the final draft
report of the HSC, which version was received by INTD on 1 /20/76.

Mr. Fipp was furnished the following information, which to the
best of my recollection was the way in which this was handled by INTD.

At approximately 5 p.m. on 1/20/76 SA Dalseg received from
Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, two copies of
the draft report. SA Dalseg furnished these two copies to then Assistant
Director Wannall who in turn appointed me to coordinate the review of the
report, which consisted of approximately 340 pages, for classified material
and any errors concerning information furnished by the Bureau to the HSC.
This review was t accomplished by 9 p.m. 1/20/76 and the results
furnished to ae CIA. Based on Mr. Wannall's instructions,
each Section Chief, INTD, was assigned approximately 50 pages to review.
SA Ryan was assigned the task of reviewing the Cointelpro portions of the
report and, as the report contained considerable information concerning the
U. S. Recording Company, the Inspection Division was requested to review
that portion of the report. Tom Hardy, a former informant handled by
General Investigative Division, had been interviewed by the Committee.
Accordingly, General Investigative Division was requested to review that
portion of the report. As former SA Arthur Murtagh had testified before
the Committee and made a number of allegations concerning the Bureau, a
portion of the report was referred to the Finance and Personnel Division
for review.

With the short deadline imposed, five Xerox copies of the report
were made making a total of seven copies of the report in the possession of
the INTD::.. These copies were handled as follows: one copy to Mr. Adams,
one copy to Mr. Wannall; one copy to you; one copy to IS-3, INTD; one copy
to Mr. Ryan; one copy split up for review by appropriate Sections of INTD;
and one copy split up for review by Inspection, General Investigative, and
Finance and Personnel Divisions.

After conferring with Assistant Director Mintz it was
that Deputy Assistant Director Cregar would contact McDaniels telephoni-

Attorney General over the signature of the Chairman of the Committee
looking into this matter. This was done on the afternoon of 4/29/76
and McDaniels said that he would definitely be contacting the Attorney

writing. Cregar advised McDaniels that the Bureau would take no further
action in this matter pending advice from the Attorney General's Office.

oh opy of a memorandum,

There is attattred—hereto
dated March 20, 1976, from the Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency to the Attorney General, concerning
an alleged unauthorized disclosure of three Top Secret
CIA documents. The CIA requests that an investigation
be.initiated to determine the extent of the disclosure

ofthe three Top Secret documents, as well as the individuals

responsible.

In order to determine whether any action by the Depart-.
ment of Justice is necessary, you are requested to conduct

a preliminary inquiry along the following lines:
1. Whether the documents were properly classified.
2. The origin of the documents and the name of the

individual responsible for the security of the
classified data.

3. The extent of official dissemination of the data.

4, Whether the data has been the subject of prior
official releases.

‘MEMORANDUM FOR: The Honorable Edward H. Levi af

Hite FROM George Bush :
SUBJECT 2 Unauthorized Release of Agency
aaa ne Classified Documents

I. On 4 February 1976 this Agency learned that a :
package of Agency documents ; three of which are classified 1
Top Secret and contain codeword indicators, are in the
possession of Mr. Fred Land, Document Control Officer, R&D
_ Associates, 4640 Admiralty Way, Marina del Rey (Los Angeles
‘<avea), California. This package of documents was ‘placed in 7 4
the. custody of Mr. Land by Mr. Roland Herbst, an executive
. o£ RGD Associates, Mr. Herbst apparently received the package
from one Dr. Albert Wohlstetter who may have received the
documents from an unknown media repréSéntative.

“2, Copies of all of the documents in the package were 1
provided by the Agency to the-House Select Committee on Hl
Intelligence Activities between.15 November and 12 December
1975.. One of the three Top Secret documents was sent directly eo
to the White House by this Agency for release to the House :
Select Committee in response to the subpoena levied by the ii
House Select Committee against the White House. This partic- - H
ular document, ‘considered the most sensitive of the three, is
an extract from the National Intelligence Daily of 5 July 1974. |
ALL of. the documents in the package pertain to SALT. :

3. Apparently, some of the unclassified documents in
the package were released to the press by the House Select
Committee on 17 December 1975, A review of press coverage
of this release would suggest that the Top Secret documents
were not generally included in this distribution. This Agency

did not authorize the release of these three classified
documents. — ; :

4. You are requested to initiate an investigation
designed to identify the extent of exposure of the three Top.
Secret documents as well as those individuals responsible,
This Agency would appreciate receiving the investigative
results, which should be directed, Attention: ‘Director of

coordinate any Agency support of the investigation you may

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: HOUSTUDY
62-116464

Earlier discontent with Field had been expressed
by HSC staff aide James Oliphant to SA Paul V. Daly, Legal
Counsel Division, in that Field was thought to have furnished
the "New York Times" with a copy of the HSC report (see
memorandum Legal Counsel to J. B. Adams, captioned "HOUSTUDY,"
dated 2/24/765.

The only known FBI changes in the HSC report occurred
as a result of FBI write-ups which were furnished to the
Committee. As background, at the request of the Attorney
General's staff on 1/20/76, INID reviewed the first draft of
the HSC report, and prepared requested comments concerning
imaccuracies and classified data in the report. The comments
were furnished tothe Attorney General and Mr. Mitchell Rogovin,
Special Counsel to the Director of Central Intelligence.
Rogovin had been designated spokesman for the intelligence
community in negotiating changes in the HSC report. He met
with the HSC staff on 1/22/76 to negotiate such changes,
utilizing the Bureau write-ups. The final HSC report printed
in "The Village Voice" varied from the first draft in that
some of the changes set out in the FBI write-ups had been
incorporated. No FBI representative was present at the
1/22/76, negotiations. The write-ups furnished to Rogovin
were the only changes suggested by the Bureau prior to the
release of the final HSC report.

1 Member from Public Works and Transportation.
1 Member from Government Operations,

1 Member from Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
A Chairman to be nominated by the Speaker.

b. The candidates for membership on the standing Committee on
Intelligence shall be nominated by resolution from the above listed
committees, supplying the number of members designated above.
Nominees shall then be confirmed by the Democratic caucus or the Re-
publican conference by means of a secret ballot. Vacancies shall be filled
by like action.

c. Candidate selection for service on the standing Committee on
Intelligence shall be based. on individual qualifications and technical
expertise, rather than party affiliation, except that, the total member-
ship of the standing Committee on Intelligence must always have no
less than one-third of its total members from each of the major parties.
Should the occasion arise when a Major Party does not have one-third
of its members represented on the committée, the Speaker shall desig-
nate to the nominating committee or committees the necessary number
of partisan candidates to be selected.

B. RELEASE OF INFORMATION

1. I recommend that the standing Committee on Intelligence, or
any member of the committee, shall not directly or indirectly release
any information, documents or data bearing a security classification
unless and until the following sequential procedures have been
completed :

(a) The committee passes a resolution expressing the need and
reason for declassification. .

(6) The appropriate administrative agency has been allowed.
reasonable time to agree with the declassification or to present
reasons for opposition. _

(2) A. House Leadership Committee, consisting of the Speaker,.
the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, the Majority and
Minority Whips and the chairmen of the committees from which
the: Intelligence Committee Membership has been selected (a
majority of the total being present), shall approve or disapprove
of the declassification and release. .

(d) Notwithstanding the committee’s approval or disapproval,
any committee member who disagrees shall have a right to peti-
tion individual members of the Leadership Committee. If three or
more members of the Leadership Committee shall concur, said
member shall have a right to be heard by the full Leadership
Committee.

(e) Any Intelligence Committee member who shall release any
materials, documents, or data bearing a security classification,
without complying with the above provisions shall be subject to
expulsion from the House of Representatives and shall be subject
to appropriate criminal or civil action, notwithstanding legislative
immunity.

2. a, Any member of the House having knowledge of classified
materials, documents or data who shall release such material, doc-
uments or data without obtaining the approval of a majority of the

NW 55319 DoclId:32989711 Page 68

members of the Leadership Committee shall be subject to expulsion
from the House of Representatives and shall be subject to any appro-
priate criminal or civil actions, notwithstanding legislative immunity.

C. PENALTIES FOR IM[PROPER RELEASE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

I recommend that the United States Code be amended to provide
criminal sanctions against any person who shall disclose or reveal
properly classified information, locuments, data, or plans concerning
the national security of the United States, such sanctions to apply
regardless of intent to harm the United States or to aid a foreign na-
tion, notwithstanding legislative immunity.

Dara Mizrorp.

RecomMenpATION or Hon. Morean F. Morery

In light of the investigation by the House Select Committee on In-
telligence, I recommend that Congress enact legislation or amend exist-
ing legislation to protect the confidentiality of tax records of American
citizens.

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code refers to tax returns as
“public records” but specifies that they be “open to inspection only
upon order of the President and under rules and regulations pre-
scribed by the Secretary or his delegate and approved by the
President.”

Public use and abuse of the records, however, have been more the
rule than the exception in the recent past. There has been little em-
phasis on the need for protecting the confidentiality of tax records.

T recommend a, shift in emphasis back to the basic right of taxpayers
to privacy regarding their tax affairs. We must do more than limit dis-
closures to certain agencies, individuals, congressional committees, and
States. We must require the entity seeking tax information to prove
that such information is essential to the entity’s function and further,
that the tax information cannot otherwise be acquired. I suggest that
House and Senate committees with jurisdiction act with all deliberate
speed to finalize their work on legislation to better ensure the privacy
of tax records.

Morgan F. Murrny.

Apprtonan Recomamxvation or Hon. Jamns V. Srawron

I would go beyond recommendation N of the select committee, which
proposes that the Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs be prohibited from holding any Cabinet-level position, by rec-
ommending the enactment of legislation which (1) states that the
individual who holds this position cannot hold any other office in the
Federal Government, nor may he be a member of the Armed Forces,
(2) requires Senate confirmation of this position, and_(8) in order to
achieve these purposes, establishes statutorily the position of Special
Assistant to the President for National Security “Attain, T have intro-
duced a bill, H.R. 10754, which embodies these provisions.

Avrernarive Recommenpations or Hon. Rosert McCrory

I support the recommendations contained in the majority report
under headings: D, F, G, I, J, L, N, O, Q, R, and S (with the exception
of section 1). I do not approve of the other recommendations and I
offer the following alternative recommendations in those areas in which
L believe reform is necessary and appropriate.

Aurernartvn Recomatinpations or Hon. Rosurr McCory

I recommend that there be established a. permanent standing Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.

1, The committee shall consist of five members composed of one
member from each of the following committees: (a) Appropriations:

‘p) Armed Services, (c) International Relations, (a) rudiciary, and.
(3 Government Operations; no more than three o whom shall be
members of the same political party. The commitiee membershij
should reflect a broad representation of political and philosophical
views. .

2. No member of the committee may serve more than 3 consecutive
terms on the committee, and no member of the staff may serve more
than 6 consecutive years. .

8. Any past or current member of the committee staff who shall re-
lease, without authorization. of the committee, materials or informa-
tion obtained by the committee shall be immediately terminated from
employment and shall be fully subject to criminal and civil liability,
notwithstanding legislative immunity. a

4, The committee’s jurisdiction shall include all legislative and
oversight functions relating to all U.S. agencies and departments en-
gaged in foreign or domestic intelligence activities. The committee
shail have exclusive jurisdiction for budget authorization for all in-
telligence activities and exclusive jurisdiction for all covert action op-
erations. All remaining oversight functions may be concurrent with
other committees of the House. .

5. The committee shall be vested with subpoena power, and the
rules of the House should be amended to give the committee the right
to enforce its subpoenas through a. civil contempt proceeding in the
U.S. District Court for the District of- Columbia without specific
authorization from the full House.

B. RELEASE OF INFORMATION

_1. I recommend that the House Committee on Intelligence have the
right to release any classified information or documents in its posses-
sion or control only if the following procedures are adhered to:

(a) the committee shall have the duty to consult with other
agencies of the Government within the intelligence community
or the executive branch with respect to the public disclosure of
any classified information before any formal committee vote on
release.

_ (6) After such consultation, the committee may, by an affirma-
tive vote of a majority of the members, submit the material pro-
posed to be released to the President.

(¢) If within a reasonable period of time the President certi-
fies in writing that the disclosure of the material would be deteri-

a

13

these projects involved illegalities and abuses by the intelligence divi-
sion of IRS in my own State of Florida.

I would only comment here that our system is grossly misused when
Federal agencies violate the law in‘their attempts to enforce it. To
adopt the methods of criminals is to become indistinguishable from

em,

RECOMMENDATIONS

I strongly support the committee’s recommendation that no mem-
ber of the House serve on the new oversight committee we propose for
more than 6 years. Such a limitation will help to ensure that the com-
mittee’s members retain their objectivity and not come to look on the
intelligence community as their own private preserve.

A similar limitation should be imposed on the Directors of the CLA.
and FBI, so that neither is allowed to serve for so many years that he
can no longer distinguish between himself and his job.

One of the committee’s recommendations would reqitire the FBI
agents or informants have a judicial warrant before attempting to in-
filtrate any domestic group or association. I agree that this require-
ment is necessary to protect the rights of American citizens, but, in
light of recent tragedies perpetrated by international terrorists groups,
I feel that such a restriction should not be imposed when the group
or association is wholly or partly made up of aliens.

SUMMARY

In comparison with other intelligence agencies, and, indeed, with
Government agencies in general, I find the CIA to be highly profes-
sional and very dedicated. Despite past lack of accountability, the
CIA. is doing a high level, cost effective job, particularly in its intelli-
gence gathering function,

However, there are-serious deficiencies in the operation of the CLA.
Much constructive rebuilding must be done if American intelligence
activities are to be conducted with responsibility and integrity—and
without undermining the spirit of our democratic society.

Recommenpations or Hon. Date Miurorp
A. A HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

1. I recommend that there be formed a standing Committee on In-
telligence of the House of Representatives, and that committee shall
consist of members who hold the respect and confidence of the general
membership of the House. .

a, The membership of the standing Committee on Intelligence shall
be selected from sitting members of the following House committees :

2 Members from Armed Services.

2 Members from Internal Relations.

1 Member from Science and Technology.
1 Member from Banking and Currency.
1 Member from Judiciary.

our tradition of an open society, as well as this Nation’s moral position
throughout the world. For, if this Nation does not maintain that moral
position, there is now no other country in the world who can take our
place. .

If I were CIA Director, I would be happy to see a strong congres-
sional oversight committee, because it would be the most effective safe-
guard against wrongly conceived and wrongly motivated covert ac-
tions originating in the executive branch.

Despite allegations to the contrary, congressional investigations
have not prevented the Agency from doing an effective job. Past per-
formance bears this out; in fact, the failure of the CIA and other in-
telligence agencies to give adequate warning of several international
crises may simply indicate the limited ability of intelligence to safe-
guard our national security.

There was, for example, the October 1978, Mideast war, where there
was more than enough information available to warn of the impend-
ing Arab attack. There were other failures as well: the 1974 coup in
‘Cyprus and the subsequent Turkish invasion; the Indian nuclear ex-
plosion; the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia; the Tet offensive in
Vietnam ; and the leftist coup in Portugal. All of these “failures” oc-
curred long before any congressional committee was directed to in-
vestigate the intelligence community.

The intelligence community has operated in the past with a virtual
blank check budget. This not only removes any incentive to curtail
wasteful programs, but, through the very availability of funds, leads
to both foolish and dangerous covert operations.

Yet, I am concerned by the committee’s recommendation that a line-
item figure for the CIA appear in the budget. Is it really possible to
get a true and accurate figure? In the event that one of the branches
of the armed services details a vessel to the CIA, is the cost of that
vessel a. Part of the costs of intelligence? In my view, a line-item fig-
ure for the Agency must conform to principles of sound accounting
practice. Only then will it have any meaning at all.

THE FEI

The committee hearings on the FBI documented the problem of in-
formants turned agents-provocateur. Informants are necessary; the
pse of provocateurs is totally contrary to principles of decency and
honesty.

One of these agents-provocateur was William Lemmer, who worked
in Florida as an informant for the Bureau. Lemmer infiltrated the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War and became one of the most active
members of the chapter. As such, he allegedly suggested violent means
of expressing VVAW disagreement with the country’s Vietnam war
policy. This kind of activity, directed by the Nation’s foremost law
enforcement agency, is plainly and starkly wrong.

THE IRS

IRS projects such as “Operation Leprechaun”, “Operation Trade
Winds”, and “Operation Haven”, clearly demonstrate that the IRS
has gone far beyond its prescribed role in tax enforcement. Each of

mental to the national security of the United States, the material
would not be disclosed or released. Failing any such Presidential
certification, the committee would be able to release the material.

(d) In the event of such a certification by the President, the
committee shall be given standing to sue and the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia shall be given jurisdiction
over such disputes, so that the matter can be submitted to the
courts for judicial determination.

C. COVERT ACTION

1. I recommend that all activities involving direct or indirect at-
tempts to assassinate any individual be prohibited by law except in
time of war. . oo .

2. I recommend that appropriate legislation be enacted to require
prior approval by the House Committee on Intelligence for all mili-
tary and paramilitary covert actions proposed by the U.S. Govern-
ment, including those actions in which arms or funds for arms would
be provided covertly. . .

3. I recommend that, as to all other covert actions of a significant
size or involving significant risk, the Director of Central Intelligence
be required, within 48 hours of initial implementation, to notify
the committee in writing and in detail of the nature, extent, purpose,
risk and costs of the operation.

D. IMPROVED SECURITY FOR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THE HOUSE

1. I recommend that the Rules of the House be revised to provide
that any member who violates the confidentiality of any executive
session of any House committee may be censured or expelled by a two-
thirds vote of the House.

2. I recommend that the rules of the House be amended to provide
that any committee of the House which has access to classified infor-
mation has the authority to discipline any member which it reason-
ably believes has disclosed or publicized such information in violation
of the rules of confidentiality duly adopted by such committee. These
committees ought to be delegated authority by the full House to take
appropriate disciplinary action against such a member to ensure com-
pliance with the rules of confidentiality. Appropriate disciplinary
action could be taken only after a vote of a majority of the majority
members and a majority of the minority members of the committee;
and any member against whom such disciplinary action is taken shall
have a right of appeal to the full House.

E. GAO AUDIT AUTHORITY

I recommend that the General Accounting Office be empowered to
conduct full and complete financial audits of all intelligence agencies.
There should not be any limitation on GAO access in the performance
of these functions by any classification system, and the financial audit
function of GAO should specifically apply to those funds which cur-
rently may be expended on certification of a Director of an agency
alone.

I. DETAILEES

I recommend that intelligence agencies disclose the affiliation of
their employees on detail to other Government agencies or depart-
ments to the heads of such agencies; and that detailees not be placed
in any position in which an actual or apparent conflict of interest
might exist. ‘

(To the Recommendations of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence)

The following are my specific recommendations (on the subjects
which they concern) which may differ, vary or coincide with recom-
mendations on similar subjects by the majority. The absence of any
recommendation on a subject covered by the majority is not to be
construed as concurrence or nonconeurrence with the majority
recommendation.

Recommendation No. 1: Joint Oversight Committee

I recommend that there be established a Joint Congressional Com-
mittee on Foreign Intelligence which committee shall have oversight
and legislative authority with respect to all foreign intelligence
activities.

(a) The joint committee shall consist of no more than 14 mem-
bers, equally divided between the House and Senate. The com-
mittees of the House and ‘Senate having jurisdiction over inter-
national affairs, armed services, and defense appropriations shall
each be entitled to representation on the joint committee by at
Jeast one member of those committees.

(b) Membership on the joint committee shall be limited to a
period of 6 years and, beginning with the fifth year, at least one-
third of the committee membership shall consist of new members.

(c) Any past or current member of the joint committee staff
who shall release, without proper authorization, materials or in-
formation obtained by the joint committee shall be immediately
terminated from employment and shall be fully subject to crimi--
nal and civil action, not withstanding any plea of legislative
immunity.

(d) The joint committee shall be vested with subpoena power,
and the rules of the House shall be amended to give the joint
committee the right to enforce its subpoenas through 2. civil con-
tempt proceeeding in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia without specific authorization from the full House.

Recommendation No. 2: Obligations of the Executive Branch

I recommend that the executive branch be required to keep the
joint committee promptly and fully informed as to all intelligence
activities, including covert actions, and including full disclosure of
allocations wherever they may be in the budget with regard to foreign
intelligence and all expenditures of funds by all departments and

55319 DociId:32989711 Page 71

justify continued covert action on grounds that we foster and develop
democracy around the world.

If covert action isn’t banned, the committee’s recommendations on
covert action should be strengthened and it should be required that
the Oversight Committee have preknowledge of all major covert
activities. -

The nature of covert actions and espionage subtract from the main
xesponsibility of the CLA—to serve as an independent central research
and analysis facility. Since active involvement in clandestine opera-
tions can force analysis to be silenced for policy needs, certain present
functions of the CIA should be divided and a separate espionage
(human intelligence) /clandestine operations agency be formed.

In his testimony, Dr. Ray S. Cline called for a central research and
analysis facility to provide objective assessments of national security
data to Congress and the National Security Council. I agree, and I
believe this ought to be a separate organization, not linked to any
policymaker other than the President and as free from other institu-
tional bias as possible. Actually, research and analysis are the original
functions of the CLA and are functions that the Central Intelligence
Agency apparently does better than any other agency in the intelli-
gence community. Its research and analysis functions should be
facilitated. :

I recommend that the Central Intelligence Agency be split into two.
agencies—an intelligence research and analysis agency and a second
agency to conduct whatever espionage and covert action functions are
authorized.

In addition, I recommend that both the new intelligence research
and analysis agency and the new espionage and covert agency be inde-
pendent agencies subject to all controls recommended by this.

ommittec.

Possible violations of law by intelligence agency employees or agents:
should be investigated and, if required, prosecuted by the Department.
of Justice. No agency should have the right or capability to bar in-
vestigation or prosecution. In addition to criminal penalties there must
be provision for civil liability for abuses of authority. Legislation
should provide for jurisdiction, justiciability and standing, discovery,
and relief. .

Several other recommendations are included in my supplemento]
views to the report of the House Select Committee on Intelligence.
Every member and the public must have access to that report.

It is imperative that the House of Representatives now consider
these issues and pass legislation based on these recommendations.

Apprrionan Recosrenpations or Hox. Winiraa Leawan

There is no question in my mind that the United States must have
a strong, effective, professional intelligence service. Our national se-
curity depends on it.

Yet that intelligence service is but part of our Government. And,
like all parts, it must be balanced against a continuing need for and

_, It seems to me that whatever action this country takes in a world
that is becoming this small and this interdependent ought to be overt
action. The United States ought to begin to play an aggressive role as
an advocate of peace in the world, as an advocate of humanitarian
concerns, and frankly I believe that the level of secrecy that we have
been exposed to as members of this committee flies in the face of
democratic principle. .

Many people conveniently wrap themselves quite fully in the flag,
but when pressed to the wall on whether or not they are willing
seriously to support democratic principles, I find that they are willing
to sidestep principle.

Democracy is based on a notion of the development of a consensus.
In my estimation covert action does not provide for that consensus.
It does not provide for debate needed to achieve consensus. Instead,
covert actions are recommended and approved by a small select group
of people. The actions can at some point be extremely expensive, at:
some point extraordinarily risky and at some point fly in the face of
open debate on any given question..I think that detrimental to the
democratic process.

I am willing to try democracy. My concern is that our democracy
has been, for the most part, a charade or merely symbolic, and I am
not sure that many of us truly believe in the concept of majority rule.

I am concerned about secretly providing arms and aid to other
countries, presidents able to sit down with other presidents and making
deals. Yet these things are issues we found that are part of the range
of covert actions utilized by this country.

T think our world is much too complicated to continue to function
effectively in this manner. The more we get involved in covert action,
the more we become accused of covert actions in places where we may
not be involved at all.

So, the question is, does it really assist this country’s role in the
world to continue these kind of activities. My answer is no. Indeed,
I think we do much more harm continuing to function covertly.

Many of these operations are well-known except to the people of the
States and/or their representatives. So where does the covert rationale
apply ? It keeps people who are part of this society out of the decision,
and it comes at a level which keeps representatives of the people out
of those decisions.

I see no justification for covert operations. If we want to assist,
then. why not do it in the open and Jet the debate deal with the ques-
tion of what our role “ought” to be somewhere in the world. -On the
basis of a consensus publicly made, then we can assist. But why do we
have to play games? Why do we have to get involved?

Another related question is where have covert operations taken us?
Ave the nations that we have been involved with free democratic
societies where the masses of people have benefits of democracy, or are
those nations for the most part, military dictators, right-wing iuntas,
or regimes with extraordinary wealth and power in the hands of a few
elitists ?

Tf the latter holds, it totally contradicts stated principles of this
country. If we have been involved in covert actions which generated
democracy, freedom and justice around the world, maybe we might
arrive at some different conclusion. But I don’t think anyone can

agencies of the executive branch for foreign intelligence and covert
activities.

Recommendation No. 3: Access to and Release of Classified Infor-
mation
I recommend that the rules of the House and Senate, where neces-
sary, be conformed to accommodate the following recommendations,
and that, where necessary, legislation be enacted m aid thereof:

(a) Access to information and materials furnished to the joint
committee in executive session or classified secret by the execu-
tive branch shall not be accessible to other members of Congress
except upon a resolution permitting such access adopted ‘by a
two-thirds vote of the membership of both the House and Senate
Members, voting in person and not by proxy.

(b) Prior to any action to permit access of such information to
other Members of Congress, the executive branch shall be given
reasonable opportunity to testify and present evidence in execu-
tive session regarding the proposed action.

(c) Materials and information received from the executive
branch in executive session of the joint committee or otherwise
classified secret by the executive branch may be publicly released
only upon adoption of the resolution specified im subparagraph
(a) above and upon the adoption of a resolution permitting pub-
lic disclosure adopted by a two-thirds vote of the membership of
both the House and Senate, the debate on which shall be conducted
in secret session, and the vote on which shall be in open session by
recorded vote. :

(d) Any Member of Congress who reveals any information in
violation of the foregoing procedures may be censured or ex-
pelled by a two-third vote of the House or the Senate, as the case
may be.

Recommendation No. 4: Agreements for the Handling of Classified
Information

I recommend that any information furnished to the joint committee
by the executive branch under an agreement with the joint committee
for the handling of such information shall be binding in accordance
with the terms of that agreement on the joint committee, on the House
and Senate, and on each Member of Congress. Violation of the terms
of the agreement shall be grounds for censure or expulsion by a tiwo-
thirds vote of the House or Senate, as the case may be. _

Recommendation No. &: Director of Central Intelligence

I recommend that a Director of Central Intelligence shall be estab-
lished, separate from any of the operating intelligence agencies, for
the purpose of coordinating and overseeing the foreign intelligence
community. His purpose shall be to eliminate duplication in collection
and promote competition in analysis. . . ;

(a) The DCI shall be appointed by the President with the advice
and consent of the Senate. .

(b) The DCI shall be the chief foreign intelligence officer of the
United States, and shall be responsible for the supervision and control
of all agencies of the United States engaged in foreign intelligence.

(c) The DCI shall be a member of the National Security Council.



20

(a) The DCI may not hold any other position, office or title in the
U.S. Government. :

(e) The DCI shall, along with such other duties, constitute an office
of Inspector General for all of the foreign intelligence agencies, in-
eluding all agencies of Government which have foreign intelligence
functions. Such agency shail have the obligation to report all allega-
tions of misconduct and/or unlawful activities to the DCI.

(£) The DCI shall be responsible for the national intelligence esti-
mates and daily briefings of the President.

(g) The DCI shall be responsible for reporting to the Joint Com-
mittee on Intelligence and other appropriate committees of Congress.

(bh) All budget requests which include funds for foreign intelligence
or covert activities shall, insofar as such funds are concerned, be pre-
pared in consultation with the DCI. Although the funds for foreign
intelligence activities will continue to be budgeted in the respective
agency budgets, the DCI shall be responsible to the joint committee for
full reporting on the foreign intelligence and covert activities funding
set forth in all agency budgets.

(i) The DCT shall coordinate the functions of all foreign intelli-
ence agencies under his jurisdiction, shall eliminate unnecessary
plication, conduct periodic evaluation of the performance and

efficiency of' the agencies, and report to Congress on the foregoing at
least annually.
Recommendation No. 6 : Disclosures to Congress

I recommend that existing law (Sec. 102(d)8 of the National Secu-
rity Act of 1947) which restricts officials of the executive branch from
providing information be amended to specifically exclude from any
such prohibition all committees of Congress having appropriate juris-

iction.
Recommendation No.7: Assistant for National Security Affairs
I recommend that the Assistant to the President for National Secu-
, tity Affairs be prohibited from holding any other position, office or
title in the U.S. Government.
Recommendation No. 8: News Media and Publications

(1) I recommend that U.S. foreign intelligence agencies be pro-
hibited from covertly providing money or other valuable consideration.
to employees or full-time representatives of any journal or electronic
media with general circulation in the United States, and prohibited
from utilizing such individuals-for purposes of cover ; except that such
prohibition shall not apply to the occasional or casual furnisher of
news stories or articles tothe news media. Poe

(2) I recommend that the U.S. intelligence agencies be prohibited
from the covert publication of' books, articles or stories in any journals
or ele¢tronic niedia: with general circulation in the United States.

Recommendation.No.9: Classification -

I recommend that the classification and declassification of informa-
tion be the subject of specific legislation by the Congress.
Recommendation No. 10: Directorof the FBF

I recommend that the Director of the FBI have a term of office of
5 years.and that no director serve more than two 5-year terms.

_ These recommendations should stimulate extremely important and
timely discussion, debate and consensus about such vital and basic
questions as: °
_(1) Is secrecy compatible avith principles of democracy osten-
sibly embodied in our constitutional form of government?

2) Tf and where is secrecy necessary ? .
& How much: secrecy is required and what forms should it
take?

4) What safeguards against abuse are required ? .
‘ What, if any, are our legitimate and necessary intelligence
needs?

(6) How much change, restructuring, and/or elimination of
organizations are required to meet on the one hand the “legiti-
mate” intelligence needs of our Nation, and on the other hand
safeguard against abuse of people, power, and the Constitution?

. As our world continues its rapid changes and shifts, what
level of our already limited resources do we perceive as necessary
to meet our intelligence needs? .

These and other questions must be discussed and debated within an
atmosphere of reason. To resolve these questions and reach some con-
sensus, it will demand the best within each of us as representatives of
the people. The issues both implicitly and explicitly raised by the
committee recommendations are of extreme importance and must be
addressed within that context. .

I oppose the committee’s recommendation regarding: (A) A House
Committee on Intelligence, insofar as, “. .. The committee shall have
exclusive jurisdiction ... for all covert action operations.” I believe
that this information should be more widely shared. Discerning over-
sight is facilitated by involving several relevant committees, and I
think jurisdiction over covert action operations should be shared with:
those committees:presently involved.

I am opposed to that part of the recommendation regarding: (B)
Release of information (4) “The select committee recommends that
the rules of the House be revised to provide that any member who
reveals any classified information which jeopardizes the national se-
curity of the United States may be censored or expelled by’ a two-
thirds vote of the House.” :

“National security” is now an‘infamous phrase, one open to mis-
chievous interpretation. There is a great danger in constructing a
chilling system which allows demagogues the easy opportunity of
injuring a member by making reckless charges. .

The committee’s recommendation on covert action is not satisfac-
tory. The committee recommendations say, “1. The select, committee
recommends that all activities involving direct or indirect attempts to
assassinate any individual and all paramilitary activities shall be pro~
hibited except in time of war.” . . :

We should prohibit all covert action. _

We live in a world becoming increasingly smaller and interde-
pendent, a world/in which secrecy and cloak and dagger methods, in
my estimation, are anachronisms from the past. They should have no
place today in the world we will continue to live in.

proval. I have proposed that a standing committee be informed of
covert operations before they are approved by the President. The
standing committee or committees should not have veto power, but
the committees, or their members individually, should have the oppor-
tunity to make their views known to the President.

No doubt a number of members would simply write out a list of
reservations to cover themselves in case an operation went wrong. But
is that bad? It is a good idea to have advice reaching the President
from a few people who have a bias for negativism, There is too much
me-tooism in the executive branch already.

Tfurthermore, if the members of the new 40 Committee knew that
Congress was part of the consultative process, they would be likely to
move with greater care and discretion than has been true in the past.
Prior notification of Congress is one more governor on the intelligence

-vehicle which could inhibit the kind of reckless driving the committee
uncovered in its investigations.

‘The committee, in a number of its recommendations, has sought to
provide a framework for improvement. But we have left the CIA

i gh and dry organizationally, I believe that the CIA should be di-
vided into two separate agencies—one devoted only to analysis and
the other responsible for clandestine collection and covert operations.

Splitting the CIA is the key to attracting the kinds of young men
and women we need in intelligence analysis. The hostility the Cra. has
aroused is bound to discourage many good people from applying.
Furthermore, the analysts need interchanges with academia, an these
ties have been strained by the public perceptions that anyone con-
nected with the CIA. has blood. om his hands.

We have also seen, as in the Bay of Pigs, that proximity breeds bias.
One side of the CLA planned the Bay of Pigs, The other side of the
CLA was not in a position to analyze it independently and critically.

‘Critics say it is impossible to separate covert collection from covert
operations, that many of the same people are used for the two pur-
poses. This is quite true. However, my proposal leaves covert collec-
tion and covert operations in the same organization and simply splits
them off from the analytical function. .

No improvements will result if proposals for reform are consigned
to the archives like the report of this committee. Our intelligence serv-
ices have been ignored by Congress in the past—and we have seen the
consequences of that inattention. Congress now has a second. chance to
decide if it wishes to play Pontius Pilate and wash its hands of an

- unpleasant ‘business or confront the issue headon. I hope the Congress
will not abdicate its responsibilities any more, oe

domestic group or association, when (1) investigation of such group
or association or its members is based solely on title 18 US.C. sec.
9388, 2884, 2385, and (2) there is no credible evidence that such group:

vocated or suggested. the use of violence, terrorists activities or other
unlawful activity.

a, The committee membership should reflect a broad representation
of political and philosophical views.

b. The committee should consist of not more than 18 or less than
nine members, designated by the President pro tem of the Senate and.
the Speaker of the House in consultation with the minority leader of
each House. The majority shall have one more than one-half of the
members appointed from either House. . .

c. No Member of the committee may serve more than 3 consecutive
terms on the commitiee, and no member of the staff may serve more
than 6 years.

a. Any past or current member of the committee staff who shall re-
lease, without authorization of the committee, materials or information
obtained by the committee shall be immediately terminated from em-
ployment and shall be fully subject to criminal and civil action, not-
withstanding legislative immunity.

e. The committee shall be vested with subpoena power and shall
have the right to enforce by a proceeding for, civil contempt its sub-
poenas in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or any
other court of competent jurisdiction, [without authorization] éf au-
thorized [from the House, provided the committee has so designated]
by resolution. The committee staff shall be given statutory standing to
represent the committee in any proceeding arising from the issuance
of a subpoena. .

_£ The committee’s jurisdiction shall include all legislative and over-

sight functions relating to all U.S. agencies and departments engaged
in foreign or domestic intelligence. he committee shall have exclu-
sive jurisdiction for budget authorization for all intelligence activities
and exclusive jurisdiction for all covert action operations, All remain-
ing oversight functions may be concurrent with other committees.
* [Nors: I am opposed to the creation of two oversight committees on
intelligence: one in the House and one in the Senate. I favor instead
the creation of a joint committee because it will reduce the burden on
the DCI and intelligence officials of repeating testimony before com-
mittees with similar jurisdiction and also reduce the burden of Con-
gress by having many members assigned to tasks which are duplicative.
In addition, concentration of oversight in one joint committee would
reduce the possibility of unauthorized disclosure of information and
more importantly would help assure that problems would not “fall
betiween two chairs” and be addvessed by neither committee, The fact
that each appropriations committee in reviewing the budget of the
intelligence-gathering agencies would have an oversight function re-
duces the possibility that one joint committee would be co-opted by
the intelligency agency.]

_ “Each committee shall keep a complete record of all committee ac-
tion which shall include a copy of all reports, statements, and testi-
mony of witnesses whether received in open or in exécutive session.”

T. DOMESTIC

1. The select committee recommends that judicial warrant must
issue, on probable cause, before an informant or any other agent of the
FBI may infiltrate any domestic group or association, when investi-
gation of such group or association or its members is based solely on
title 18 U.S.C. §§ 2383, 2384, 2385, :

2. The select committee recommends that the Director of the FBI
have a term of office no longer than 2 presidential terms. ;

3, The select committee recommends that the Internal Security
Branch of the Intelligence Division be abolished and that the counter-
intelligence branch be reorganized to constitute a full division named

‘the Counter-Intelligence Division; that the mission of this Division

be limited to investigating and countering the efforts of foreign di-
rected groups and individuals against the United States. . .

4. The select committee recommends the transfer of all investiga-
tions of alleged criminal activity by domestic groups or individual
members thereof to the General Investigative Division.

5, The select committee recommends that regulations be promul-
gated that tie the investigation of activities of terrorist groups closely
to specific violations of criminal law within the investigative juris-
diction of the FBI and that charge the Department of Justice with
determining when a domestic political action group may be appropri-
ately targeted for investigation of terrorist activities.

ApprrronaL Recomarenpations or Hon. Las Aspux

All the hearings, all the hassles and all the headlines should have
underscored the fact that the Select Committee really faced three
challenges: .

how to banish abuses from the intelligence system ;

how to control covert operations; and. . .

how to improve the intelligence product, the analyses for which
we spend so much money. . . . .

The committee has approved a number of recommendations which
go to the heart of these problems. ~ .

The establishment of an Independent Inspector General for Intelli-
gence will provide an office designed exclusively to hawkeye the in-
telligence community and se¢ that itis adhering tothe law.

‘The institutionalization of a successor to the 40 Committee will pro-
vide systematic direction of covert operations by the executive branch
for the first time. ; . .

And creation of a more powerful director of central intelligence will
for the first time give one man the authority to whip the many in-
elligence fiefdoms into line and eliminate the duplication and waste
that the committee found to be rife. - . a

JI think that there is more that we could have done and I have two
additional proposals, . mo :

The select committee suggested that a standing committee be in-
formed of an approved covert operation within 48. hours after its ap-

States engaged principally in foreign or military intelligence, directly
or indirectly engage in the training or the supplying of domestic
police agencies of the United States, and that contacts between police
agencies of the United States and U.S. foreign or military intelligence

[1. The Select Committee recommends that judicial warrant must
issue, on probable cause, before an informant or any other agent of
the FBI may infiltrate any domestic group or association, when in-
vestigation of such group or association or its members is based solely
on title 18 U.S.C. § 2383, 2384, 2385. ;

[2. The select committee recommends that the Director of the FBI
have a term of office no longer than 2 presidential terms.

[8. The select committee recommends that the Internal Security
Branch of the Intelligence Division be abolished and that the Counter-
Intelligence Branch be reorganized to constitute a full division named
the Counter-Intelligence Division ; that the mission of this division be
limited to investigating and countering the efforts of foreign directed
groups and individuals against the United States.

[4. The select committee recommends the transfer of all investiga-
tions of alleged criminal activity by domestic groups or individual
members thereof to the General Investigative Division.

[5. The select committee recommends that. regulations be promul-
gated that tic the investigation of activities of terrorist groups closely
to specific violations of criminal law within the investigative juris-
diction of the FBI and that charge the Department of Justice with
determining when a domestic political action group may be appropri-
ately targeted for investigation of terrorist activities.J

CONCLUSION

As these recommendations indicate, my service on the-select commit-
tee has convinced me that reforms are necessary to improve the. orga-
nization, performance, and control of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity. At the same time, the experience of the past-months has again
confirmed my understanding of how important an effective intelligence
capability is to the future security of the American people. Intelli-
gence officials can and must operate in a manner consistent with the

- Individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. These

protections must be guaranteed, but so must the right of the American
people to live in security and peace. It is both possible-and essential
for the intelligence agencies to perform their responsibilities effec-
tively, and by means which protect both individual rights and national
security.

At a minimum, the intelligence community must regain the trust
and confidence of the people whom it serves. It is tragic that it was
necessary to establish this committee to inquire into the activities of
agencies on which we depend so heayily for our security. But it would
be even more tragic if the results of our investigation were now to be
ignored. Implementing the recommendations i have proposed _ will
contribute significantly to ensuring that there will be no need for
another such committee to be established in the future. Both Congress
and the American people must recognize the need to complete the task

which we have only begun. 5

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75
Disposition of House Select
Committee (HSC) Records
62-116464

DETAILS:

On 2/11/76, Captain John Matheny, supra,
telephonically advised Senstudy 75 Project that on that
date a hasty agreement had been reached between the
executive branch and HSC concerning the interim disposition
of the HSC's documents. Captain Matheny stated the agreement
was reached in pegotiations between CIA and Representative
Otis G, Pike, Chairman of the HSC, and HSC Staff. Captain
Matheny stated the details of this agreement, other than
the fact documents would be going to CIA under seal, were

“as yet unclear; however, he would immediately advise when

same were «. known.

On the p.m. of 2/12/76, Captain Matheny tele-
phonically advised Senstudy 75 Project details of the
agreement were as follows:

(1) All documents furnished to the HSC by
executive branch departments or agencies on an “on loan”
basis would be returned to the originating department or
agency.

(2) All items or materials received from the
National Security Council would be returned thereto.

(3) All transcripts of hearings, public and
executive, and interviews conducted by the HSC and all
materials received unsolicited or otherwise generated by
the HSC would be placed in safekeeping with the National
Archives.

Re: Houstudy 75

(4) All other material received from executive
branch departments or agencies would be placed for safekeeping
with CIA in sealed cartons which are not to be disturbed,
opened or their contents examined except on further author-
ization from the House of Representatives or the Speaker
of the House.

Captain Matheny stated it had been decided that
the material going to CIA under seal would be first segregated
as to originating department or agency and thereafter placed
in separate cartons, sealed and the originator identified
thereon.

He further stated that Mr. Antonin Scalia,
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Department
of Justice, had agreed to the above arrangements on behalf
of the Department of Justice and its agencies.

He advised that Bureau representatives should be
present beginning on 2/13/76 in order to oversee the
segregation of documents and to account for and seal material
provided by the Bureau, -

On 2/13/76, and again on 2/17 and 2/20/76, Special
Agents Andrew J, Duffin and Sammy J, Miller of the Senstudy 75
Project were physically present at the HSC offices, along
with representatives of several other departments and
agencies, It is noted the HSC's resolution had expired as
of 1/31/76 and present on behalf of the HSC during this
particular period were only Ms. Jacqueline Hess, HSC Security
Officer, several unidentified HSC Staff Members involved in
extraneous and personal matters not connected with this
project, and a uniformed guard,

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75

Disposition of House

Select Committee (HSC) Records
62-116464

It was stated by Ms. Hess that there was some
urgency involved with the segregation and transportation
of the HSC documents to CIA as the physical protection
being provided to the HSC premises by the security guard
would cease as of 2/20/76.

It should be noted it was immediately obvious
that chaotic conditions had existed at the HSC, particularly
evident in the complete disarray of their records and
materials, All materials, irrespective of originating
department or agency, were haphazardly commingled and
the elementary records management system attempted by
the HSC, by Ms. Hess' admission, had failed. She stated
HSC Staff Members, in their haste to depart, had returned
documents which had been in their personal possession
en massé, including numerous reproductive copies of various
and sundry documents, as well as personal notes, memoranda
and memorabilia.

At the outset, it was determined the material
furnished by the FBI was accounted for by the HSC upon
receipt only by filing the FBI transmittal LHM adjacent
to a copy of the pertinent HSC request lettér in a loose~leaf
binder. (This binder is sealed in carton at CIA marked
"HSC Transmittal Books,"”) Ms. Hess stated that this was
not done in every instance and, in fact, particularly if
the FBI LHM contained pertinent information, it more often
than not was furnished directly to the HSC Staff Member
who had initiated the request. In cases such as this,
the LHM may or may not have ultimately been incorporated
in her notebook,

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75
Disposition of House Select
Committee (HSC) Records
62-116464

Initially, Ms. Hess had extracted some portions
of the FBI material and had it ready for inventory.
Thereafter, in her search through various filing cabinet
drawers, she would come upon different batches of material
and would make these available. For the most part, these
included not only material originating with the FBI but
from various other departments and agencies, Due to the
enormity of the task, the constraints of time and the
existing working conditions, it was impossible to log in
or itemize each and every FBI document on hand, Therefore,
the inventory undertaken was in the form of accounting
for each FBI response made to HSC requests by locating
each particular responsive LHM and matching it with its
enclosures, if any, In the absence of the LHM, documents,
which were obviously enclosures, were generically described
and at a later date, through Senstudy 75 Project records
available at FBIHQ, identified with specific HSC requests
and FBI responses, and thereby accounted for,

FBI material inventoried and sealed amounted to
approximately 6 % cardboard cartons which were sealed with
Scotch-brand filament tape and identified on the ends
with the markings "HSC/FBI" followed by an arabic number
for the carton. It is noted that box number 7, in addition
to FBI materials, also contains materials from State, DEA,
Civil Service, OMB, Treasury/IRS and IC. This was done
to limit the number of boxes involved as none of the above
had sufficient material to fill an additional box.

As FBI material was accounted for and sealed,
a Xerox copy of the generic inventory maintained was
provided to Ms. Hess as well as to Ms. Libby Moran, CIA
Review Staff Representative, who was overseeing this entire

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Houstudy 75

matter for CIA, At a subsequent time at FBIHQ, this
generic inventory was reconciled with Senstudy 75 Project
Unit records and an additional inventory was compiled
setting forth in date order HSC requests, noting date of
FBI response, as well as the box number location of the
material involved. Upon completion of this detailed
reconciliation, it was determined that 13 original FBI
LHMs which were sent to the HSC in response to requests,
11 of which had no enclosures, are unaccounted for and,
at this point, they are presumed, by Ms. Hess, destroyed.
(The &nclosures transmitted with the two~ were accounted
for.) This presumption is made because Ms, Hess reiterated
many times that LHMs which contained information of
interest to the HSC were often not logged by her and
were forwarded directly to interested HSC Staff Members.
She noted that, during the waning days of the Committee,
much material the Staff Members considered expendable was
destroyed by shredding. Specifically, concerning FBI LHMs,
she stated it was the HSC's position that they, if they
transmitted enclosures, were nothing more than letters

of transmittal requiring no accountability, If they
contained information without enclosures, they were
considered to be Committee, not FBI, property and could
be disposed of at the Committee's pleasure,

In addition, it was determined that two LHMs,
both with enclosures, were unaccounted for and their
disposition is unknown. By way of description, these
documents concern: (1) FBI 9/14/75 response to an 8/19/75
request which transmitted to the HSC four generic lists
regarding tax reports filed by the FBI with the IRS
setting forth deductions made from informant payments
covering calendar years 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973, These

lists do not identify informants and:‘only set forth amount
of taxes withheld; and (2) FBI 11/11/75 response to a
9/30/75 request which transmitted numerous documents setting
forth the various criteria which have been utilized to
include an individual's name on the ADEX, a chart portraying
a statistical breakdown of the ADEX, authority for
maintaining the ADEX and documents pertaining to its
predecessor, the Security Index.

With the above exceptions, all other FBI responses
were accounted for, it being emphasized again, that not
each and every document was logged. Further, there is no
way of aecounting for the multiple copies of documents
reproduced by the HSC Staff from those made available by
the Bureau, other than to the extent that extra copies
located during the above inventory were personally shredded
by Bureau personnel.

The original generic inventory, as well as the
detailed reconciliation, is being maintained with the
Senstudy 75 Project files.

There.-is attached a 2/27/76 CIA memorandum for
executive branch departments and agencies in which CIA,
as custodian of the documents, asks interested parties to
advise Captain John Matheny, Office of the Assistant to
the President fof National Security Affairs, whether any
documents are missing, Captain Matheny will prepare and

‘Dear Chairman Pike: Siiceai a aniceaiaale ;
I hereby acknowledge and accept the tems set forth in your
letter of February 20 for safekeeping of the three categories of |

sensitive classified documents Furnished to or "generated by the -
House Select Committee on Intelligence.

As to 2 first category, pursuant to ‘your “tetter, the Fon’
joan" material which was loanéd to the Select Comittee by the
_ Executive branch hes been received by the CIA and such material
has been returned to the originating departments and agencies.

With regard to the second category of nateriels, the trans-
cripts of testimony taken from current and former Federal, officials
in executive sessions of the Select Comittee, it is my understanding
that these documents will be placed in the National Archives building
for safekeeping in the custody of the Archivist of the United States,
and that no one is to be given access to these materials pending . oA
further instructions from the House of Representetives or Speaker of .-

_ the House. As you indicated in your letter of February 20 to the
Archivist, highly sensitive classified information is contained in
these transcripts, and they should be treated accordingly by the |
Archivist. I am also concerned about any future plans for the dis- ~
position of these transcripts. This material includes information -
involving sensitive sources and methods which I ami ‘charged by lay | ~
to protect from mauthorized disclosure.. F would, therefore,

. appreciate it if you would bring this concern to the attention of
the Speaker of the House and request that I be involved in any ~~
decision regarding the future disposition of this material. ;

Headquarters. for Storage Were initially inventoried and sealed in -
cartons by’ Executive branch representatives on the premises of the
Select Committee in the presence of Committee staff members during

_ the period of February 18-20. Because a number of documents were
unaccounted for, it was agreed with your staff representative that
certain cartons should be inventoried again to determine whether
the missing doaments might be in those cartons, Thus, a thorough
second inventory of certain sealed cartons was conducted at CIA on
February 21 with your concurrence and in the presence of Ms. Jacqueline

documents were found in the second inventory, a number of documents

As soon as a complete list of the missing materials is pre-

Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC) suppressed report.

By memorandum dated 2/13/76, Assistant Attorney

to the publication by "The Village Voice" of the HSC suppressed
report. Thornburg, in his memorandum, requested this Bureau solicit
other agencies and to furnish information relating to FSI classified
material that was disclosed in "The Village Voice." He indicated
this inquiry was necessary to determine if any action by the Depart-
ment of Justice is necessary,

idemorandum from Mr, Cassidy to Mr. Wannail dated
1/21/76, captioned "Houstudy," advised that appropriate components
of FBIHQ had been solicited and only one instance was determined
where classified material appeared in the Draft Final Report of the
HSC. This occurred in the identification of three of our foreign
eounterintelligence programs by title, it being noted the names af
these programs had been classified "Secret" by the Attorney General.

Hon. Frank Church
U.S. Senate
Washington, L.C.

Dear Sen. Church:

By way of beckground, I served honorebly with both the Federsl Bureay of Invest.
igation and the Central Intelligence Agency for a combined total of over 33
years. I am proud of my service with each agency and I feel that my activities
were quite worthwhile and in the netional interest. I em s graduste of George
Washington University Law School and a member of the bar, 1 em now retired.

As an interested and intellectually curious .citizen, 1 heve been reeding
accounts in the public press concerning the ectivities of the committee which
you happen to chéir and of the House Committee which Kep. Otis Pike happens to
chair, both dealing with the U.S, investigative and intelligence progrems.brief-
ly stated, 1 am totally nausested by the irresponsible way in which both of you
demand highly sensitive end classified deta which seems to be publicized soon
after you get it. It is my opinion and thet of many friends thet your committees
are effectively destroying the credibility of these agencies and making impos~
sible their effective performance in the future.

Before going further, let me state thet I do not condone irregulserities, im-
proprieties or illegelities by either egency in their normel,routine activities jj
but I do see the justificetion,in serious security or Mefia like criminal scti- H
vities,for certain ‘extracurriculsr" activities to echieve needed ends and I 1
think that the Congress should quietly recognize such,with reesonable controls,

You should be proud end complimentary,for instence in my opinion,sbout the |
highly publicized end often misrepresented mail intercept program when you {
stop to realize that it wes confinec to msil to and from Russia and,insofer ss |

i

I reed, the results were given appropriate safeguards.

I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these
agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to
having appropriate edministrative action taken sgainst offending employees snd
officials,if their rights are protected. What I do strongly object to is the
pathetically inept and horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inquiries :
on sensitive matters are regularly reported,sometimes incompletely end for ‘
apperent political reasons. It just seems to me that someone connected with your
committees is afflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels-
them to bebble without regard to common sense or the welfere of our intelligence
programs end, es I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.

I am sure thet the intelligence organizations of a11 major nations meke some
mistakes.But have you ever seen the British,the French,the Russisns,the
Germans,the Isreeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring
circus" on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discredit?
I am sure also thet we are the laughing stock of 811 the above enumereted
nations, What foréign official will entrust sensitive snd confidential date to
U.S, intelligence agents in the foreseesble future when he knows thet he mey soon
see his data publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? 1 very
sincerely feel that strong administrative and/or criming1 action should be taken
in any cases where either or both of your committees and/or their personnel heve
been the vehicle for embarrassing or damaging the U.S. by actions which resulted
in confidential data being reported.

In order that there be no misunderstanding,this letter represents nothing
more then my very sincere conviction of great personal contempt and disgust with
the way in which you snd your committees have done a great disservice to the
paated Stetes by sadly mishandling your responsibilities to these agencies and

ample of how far this nation
has strayed from its underly-

We are genuinely delighted |-

Many times lately we can-

that we can never fully regain

It is all the more tragic that
in this Bicentennial year, the
heart of federal government
' has so deteriorated as today to
' represent the largest and
most ominous single threat to
human rights and freedoms
outside the covetous totalitari-

We certainly would not ad-

However, we would sharply

Due to the fact that this matter is being handled in Records Section 7
through normal mail processing procedures, it is most difficult to determine
which specific individual(s) may have typed a certain card or abstract, searched
a particular name, reviewed a particular file, etc. Therefore, names of

: individuals have not been given. In some instances, a specific number of 4
individuals involved may be known and, where applicable, this has been shown.
But in some units it is impossible to know even how many persons performed
the work relative to a specific subject, All that can be given in some cases is
the estimated number of hours in a particular grade or level based on production
figures relating to this matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mitchell Rogovin
: SC/DCI

SUBJECT — H Mandl. ing of HSC and ssc Imrestigative Materials

Representatives of the Department of State, Department of
Defense, Department of Justice, the National Security Council
Stat, end the Central Intelligence Agency have considered al-

: ternative ways for storing and | handli ing the materials gathered
. by the Senate and House Select Committees in their, current study
* of the intelligence activities of the government. °

The key objectives were those of physically secure storage,
with proper controls over access to the materials, the ultimate
: decision on nomial declassification remaining with the depart-
“ments, agencies or organizations that originated the materials.

‘two main alternatives were developed for where the materials
should be stored. These were the National Security Agency (NSA)
and the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), the pre-
: ference being for the former. The NSC Staff, in preferring storage
' = at NSA, specified additional handling provisions for its materials.
Attached are alternative draft resolutions, providing for
* storage at NSA or at NARS. Also attached is the NSC staff pro-
posal for modification of the proposal for storage at NSA, providing
for special handling there of NSC materials. These are intended to
provide a basis for discussions with SSC and HSC personnel.

It is requested that this report be submitted to the ICG. It
is noted that time has become an essential consideration, in view
of the imminent conclusion of the HSC investigation.

this Bureau will, upon request, continue to make the ADEX 1

Authority for maintaining the ADEX stems from the

was requested are available for review by appropriately

ragard, it is to he noted that authority for maintaining the
| SI stemmed from the: Attorney General in connection with the
| Departmental portfolio entitled "Program for Apprehension and
Detention of Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to

i
| Detailed information and documents concerning what
steps were to be taken in event of a national emergency are
set forth in the above-mentioned portfolio which, since that
, @ocument originated with the Department of Justice, should
be obtained from that source,

As has previously been stated, the ADEX is reviewed
continuously and on a monthly basis is brought up to date
with names being added and deleted. ‘The SI list was prepared
in the same manner and, as with the formar SI, when a new
monthly ADEX list is prepared copies of the old list
are destroyed inasmuch as they are outdated and no longer
serve a useful purpose, Also, as you have previously. been
advised, names appearing on the former SI and the ADEX
have been printed on § = 8 cards with a single name printed
on each card. Backeround information, file numbers, and

type of activity in which the individual is engaged is also
‘placed on these cards.,: As was explained to Mr. Vermeire on ~~
October 17, 1975, approximately 15,0000f these cards, ail

manner on the new ADEX, as eases were reviewed under our then
existing reporting procedures, each case was to be reviewed
on its own merits utilizing the then current criteria for ADEX
to determine whether continued inclusion on the ADEX wag
warranted, If not, the individual's name.was deleted. As
previously indicated, during 1972 the ADEX wag evaluated and
revised and as a resnit, the number of individuals whe were

wag instituted during the SI program, these cancelled cards
axe maintained at FRIHQ for a period of three years and

Mr, Oliphant stated the purpose of the interview was as: indicated above
and also asked if they could inquire inte my knowledge and/or participation in
connection with the purchase of equipment from the U. S, Recording Company,

Upon inquiry, Mr. Oliphant was informed that I had participated in a
poker party at the Blue Ridge Club on two or three oecasions but not on any
occasion within the last six or so years. He was also informed that Mur, Mohr
was present on these occasions and served as a collector for the fee for the cost
of lodgirig and food on the oceasions F attended. He was informed that Mir. Tait
and Mr, Cberdick were probably present; however, no business of any kind
was discussed, it being purely a social event with the primary purpose of getting
away from shop and shop-talk, He was further advised on the occasions that I
was in attendance former Assistant Director Donald Parsons was the host member
of the Blue Ridge Club, In response te an inquiry as to why 1 had not attended
in more recent years, he was informed that I did not do so after my youngest
son married and left home as I did not gare to leave the Mrs. alone for the

Interview of Associate Director Nicholas P, Callahan
by Timothy Oliphant and Richard Vermeire of the House
Committee on Intelligence Concerning U, 8S. Recording
Coragany

Lr, Tait had a summer place on the Delaware Coast in the area where I likewise
had one and on a few oceasions he has ridden by to say hello but hag not visited
extensively nor was any business discussed during these visits,

Megsre, Oliphant and Vermeiro inquired ag to the origin of the
relationship with U, 5, Recording Company and at what level was the price for
the equipment purchased from U. 8, Recording determined to be satisfactory,

T informed them that my recollection of the relationship with the U. S, Recording
Company dated back to the late 30's or carly 40's and the procedure of purchasing
gontidential types of equipment was an ongoing froeedure at the time f became in-
volved in the Administrative Division, I stated thero was no fixed procedure for
ascertaining the precise price or any markup relative thereto inasxaueh as the
nature of the items purchased was such that primary reHance was left to the
technicians of our Laboratory who had shopped the industry for the equipment
needed and that any detailed discussion regarding price would normally go through
the procurement officer of the Adiministrative Division and the technicians in the
Laboratory to see that a reasonable price was being paid but not an exorbitant or
unreasonable price, It was pointed oyt that procurement procedures in effect
would require any questionable price to be taken up with higher authority either

in the Laboratory or the Administrative Division to adjudicate such a question and
£0 my recollection there had been no occasions when this had oecurred,

Mr, Vernacire inquired as to Mr. Mohr's relationship with the Laboratory
in connection with his position as Assistant to the Director and I pointed out that
thexe were times when the Laboratory was one of the Divisions under his juris-
diction and i was sure that the organizational charts they had would seem to
indicate this,

They inquired if I was aware of the fact that the Blue Ridge Club had
suffered a fire and I advised them I had read it in the newspaper, They advised
they first became aware of it on a newscast while on thei way to visit the club,

Max. Vermeire inquired as to whether there was any inquiry being made
into the Bureau's dealings with the U, &, Recording Company and he was informed

Dircetor Kelley had instructed an inquiry to be raade into the matter right after
the testimony of Mr, Kaiser before the Committee for which they work, Upon

Company

inquiry whether there was any information available as to developments to date
with regard to this matter, thoy were informed since this was an ongoing inquiry
it would be inappropriate at this time to diseuss such with them. When asked
when the inquiry would be completed, they were informed would be concluded
very soon as the Director was just as anxious as the Committee was to have the
full picture With regard to this situation. During this discuesion Vermeiro
alluded as to the volume of the purchases made in 1071 waich information had
been previously furnished to the Commities and it was pointed out that these
purchases resulted from the break~in of our Resident Agency in Media,
Pennsylvania, and the use of U. &. Recording was two-fold: one, to preserve
the confidentiality of the type of equipment being installed throughout the
country in our Resident Agencies and two, toe obtain expedite delivery in con-
nection with such equipment.

also advised Messrs. Oliphant and Vermeire that purchases other
than those of a confidential nature wero made from U. S, Recording Company
of items on which he was the supper under the GSA general supply schedule
and where purchases on a competitive bid basis were made by soliciting bids
for iteras of equipment under this latter procedure he being on the bidder's
mailing list aleng with other manufacturers and supplisra. I pointed out that
procurement of all equipment adheres to the Federal Procurement Regulations
prescribed by the General Servicos Administration,

Reference is made to Departmental memorandum re-
ceived by Legal Counsel Division on January 13, 1976, from
Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence :
Coordination, to Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General,
Office of Legal GGunsek, captioned “HSC Request for Opinion
as to Legality of FBI Proprietaries." The House Select
Committee informally requested that the Department give it:
opinion whether the FBI's creation of corporations as
proprietaries. contravenes the prohibitions set out in
Title 31, United States Code, Section 869.

Attached is a letter dated January 23, 1976,
| econ Steven K. Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney
General, Department of Justice, to Mr. A. Searle Field,
Staff Director, Select Committee on Intelligence, United
States. House of Representatives,’ responding to the Salect
Committee's inquiries concerning thifestablishment | andsgse
of _proprietaries by the FBI. . The Dep. ‘tment '’s resp response
out that the-légisTative history of the provisions of
Section 869 makes it clear that Congress was. directing it~
self to the practice of incorporating agencies engaged
overtly in, governmental functions, and that the corporate
purpose of proprietaries is not to perform a governmental
function but to carry on a commercial activity. Thus,
proprietaries are not established for the purpose of acting
as an agency or instrumentality of the United States within
the meaning of Section 869(a). The Department further con-
tends that Section 869(b) applies solely to “wholly owned"
Government corporations, and that term is. defined by enu-
aa in Title 31, United States Code, Section 846, and
i ad in may) haya em
FBI proprietaries are near 3 o 2.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY

Section’ 869 states the following: "No corporation
shall be created, organized, or acquired on or after
December 6, 1945, by any officer or agency of the Federal
Government or by any Government corporation for the purpose
of acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United
States, except by Act of Congress or pursuant to an Act of
Congress specifically authorizing such action.

"No wholly owned Government corporation created
by or under the laws of any State, Territory, or possession
of the United States or any political subdivision thereof,
or under the laws of the District of Columbia, shall con-
tinue after June 30, 1948, as an agency or instrumentality
of the United States, and no funds of, or obtained from,
the United States or any agency thereof, including corpora-
tions, shall be invested in or employed by any such corpora-
tion after that date, except for purposes of liquidation.
The proper corporate authority of every such corporation
shall take the necessary steps to institute dissolution
or liquidation proceedings on or before that date:
Provided, That prior thereto any such corporation may be
reincorporated by Act of Congress for such purposes and
term of existence and with such powers, privileges, and
duties as authorized by such Act, including the power to
take over the assets and assume the liabilities of its re-
spective predecessor corporation. (Dec. 6, 1945, c.557,
Title IIL, Section 304, 59 Stat. 602.)"

The Act states that its. purpose is to solve the
problems of financial control and to provide annual scru-
‘tiny and current financial control by the Congress of the
financial transactions and operations of Government corpora-
tions. through the regular fiscal agencies of the Government.
It prohibits the creation of any Government corporation to
act as an agency or instrumentality of the United States
except by or pursuant to action of Congress.

Act to indicate that Congress. considered the formation of
corporations as proprietaries for undercover purposes.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY |

The legislative history of the Act heavily em-
phasizes budgetary control of Government corporations. When
the Act was being considered there were estimated to be about .
100 separate Government corporations with thousands of
employees and controlling billions of dollars of Government
funds. The corporations engaged in a variety of businesses,
including insurance and finance, as well as Government opera-
tions such as subsidies and flood control. With the increase
and importance of Government corporations, there was increased
recognition by both the legislative and executive branches
that some means be found to coordinate the financial programs
of the corporations with that of the Government as a whole.

FBI proprietaries are under the budgetary control
lof the FBI and do not present the fiscal or budgetary problems
lenvisioned by the Act. The FBI budget, in turn, is prepared
in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular
No. A-11 and is subject to extensive review and approval by
the Deparmtment of Justice, the Office of Management and
Budget, the House Appropriations Subcommittee, and the
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. Therefore, the intent
of the Act is being carried out.

Section 869 prohibits creation of a corporation
"for purposes of acting as an agency or instrumentality of
the United States Government." A proprietary does not hold
itself out to the public to be an agency or instrumentality
of the Government, and therefore not in conflict with the
statute. It is an investigative method used by the FBI in
furtherance of its duly authorized and assigned task of
investigating. violations of the laws of the United States.
A proprietary is. not a profit-oriented corporation.

Attached Departmental letter of January 23, 1976,
noted above, cites United States v. MacDaniel, 7 Peters
(32. U.S.) 1, 13-14 (1883), for the proposition that execu-
tive agencies have reasonable latitude for accomplishing
their prescribed responsibilities and do not need specific
statutory authorization for each act done. In that case, the

(3)

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo
Re: HOUSTUDY |

court said, "A practical knowledge of the actions of any one
of the great departments of the government, must convince
every person, that the head of a department, in the distri-
butions of its duties and responsibilities, is often compelled
to exercise his discretion. He is limited in the exercise of
his powers by the law; but it does not follow that he must
show statutory provision for everything he does. No govern-
ment could be administered on such principles. To attempt

to regulate, by law, the minute movements of every part of
the complicated machinery of government, would evince a most
unpardonable ignorance on the subject. Whilst the great out-
lines of its movements may be marked out, and limitation
imposed on the exercise of its powers, there are numberless
things which must be done, that can neither be anticipated nor
defined and which are essential to the proper action of

_ government."

It is concluded that Title 31, United States Code,
Section 869, should not be interpreted as applying to FBI
proprietaries because it is manifest from the statutory
history that Congress never. contemplated its use in this
type of situation.

Proprietaries

The House Select Committee has requested in-
formally that the Department give its opinion as to
whether the FBI's creation of corporations as pro-
prietaries contravenes the prohibitions set out in
31 U.S.C. 869. Attached is a very rough draft of a
HSC Report which addresses this question. (This draft
was written by a non-lawyer staff member of the HSC
who asked that we not attribute it to him av the HSC).

We would appreciate your preparing an answer to
the HSC's question. John Mintz, Assistant Director

of the FBI is familiar with this matter and may be able
to provide additional useful information concerning it.

Rett st ot : Bee
vestigation was started was addressed to each of the military
services. This issue was "What is your justification for
establishing a proprietary, normally a corporation, as a

front for carrying out an intelligence mission?"

The committee raised this question because section 869 of Title

Bl, U.S. Code (1970) states in part as follows:



_ NW 55319 DocId:32989711 Page 200

"(a) No corporation shall be created, organized

or acquired on or after December 6, 1945, by any
officer or agency of the Federal Government or by
any Government corporation for the purpos of acting
as an agency or instrumentality of the United
States, except by Act of Congress specifically
authorizing such action. :

"(b) No wholly owned Government corporation created
by or under the laws of any State, Territory or
possession of the United States or any political sub-
division thereof, or under the laws of the District
of columbia, shall continue after June 30, 1948, as
an agency or instrumentality of the United States,
and no funds of, or obtained from, the United States
or any agency thereof, including corporations,

shall be invested in or employed by any such
corporation after that date except for the purposes
of liquidation. ***"

The General Accounting Office in a letter to the Committee
Chairman dated December 10,-1975 (B-179296) which discussed
the applicability of section 869 to the authority for CIA

to establish -proprietaries stated in reference to the

legislative history of the act stated “we have found no

indication in the legislative history that Congress considered

the formation of corporations for clandestine purposes.".

“While it is recognized that the purpose of proprietaries

is to conceal the role of the government in clandestine
activities, the lack of legislative history concerning
formation of clandestine corporations must be accepted. Thus,
section 869 precludes the formation of proprietary corporations

except by Act of Congress.

_ As discussed in the following paragraphs, the Military

services disagreed strongly with the committee position in

this matter. As an example, the Army stated in essence

ane)

provide a shield of non-attribution and that it would be impossible |

to act as a U.S. government representative without destroying-

the cover of non-attribution.

The Air Force justified the use of proprietaries by citing in-howse

seosrkee approvals and approvals by the CIA and the Defense

cme emmaner:

ql
- Intelligence Agency. The Air Force stated in part "Justification 7
" existed in the need for cover for clandestine foreign intelligence a
collection activities." : i

In summary, the military services have justified the use of

proprietaries on a rather pragmatic basis which states in

essence proprietaries are approved in accordance with regula-
= ; tions, cleared by other agencies in the intelligence community,
, and could not exist for intelligence purposes if it were
known that the U.S. government had an interest in the

operation of the corporation.

On 1/28/76, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Captain John
Mathney, National Security Council Staff, White House, tele-
phonically contacted Supervisor R. H. Ross, INTD. He advised
that the eight write-ups, which had been furnished to him on
1/26/76 had proved useful. He stated that the write-ups would
be used either by being furnished to the minority members of
the HSC or incorporated into a Presidential rebuttal of the
HSC's report. He advised that he and representatives from
Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency, and Defense
Intelligence Agency were at that time preparing an overall
statement concerning the HSC's Draft Final Report. He then
read a paragraph of the statement prepared regarding that
aspect of the report which dealt with the FBI. It generally
dealt with the fact that the report tried to characterize the
FBI as an inept investigative body and how the report used a)
broad brush approach to discredit the FBI investigations. Af
The prepared statement labeled the report as fallacious in Lb
that the Committee neither balanced nor tempered its report
even though it possessed information which showed that in /
the vast majority of instances, the FBI conducted legal,
proper, and closely supervised investigations.
©
ra Captain Mathney also requested to know whether the
eight write-ups could be furnished to minority members of the
Committee (Representatives McClory, Kasten, Treen, and Milford).
Further, he invited the FBI to have a representative present
with himself and the other agency representatives mentioned
above who were at that time preparing the statement. He was
advised that his two requests would require consideration by
Bureau officials, but that he would be promptly advised.

Bureau did not desire to have a representative participate in
the drafting session. Mr. Adams instructed that Assistant
Attorney General Rex Lee be contacted to see if the Department
had any objection to furnishing any of the write-ups to the
minority members or desired to have a Departmental representa-
tive attend the drafting session. Assistant Attorney General
Lee was telephonically contacted by Supervisor Ross, who
deferred both questions to Mr. Michael Shaheen, Jr., Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination. Shaheen was contacted
and apprised of the Bureau's views and stated that it was
"entirely appropriate" for the minority members to be furnished
that information by the White House. Also he felt that there
was no need for a Departmental representative to attend.

Captain Mathney was recontacted (3:15 p.m., 1/28/76)
and advised that there was.no objection to the furnishing of
the write-ups and that the Bureau nor Department felt it
necessary to have a representative present with him.

in knowing how many times I attended such games and I
indicated my first attendance was in November, 1974 and the
jast in April, 1975.

Gliphant was interested in knowing what the cost
involved and to whom it vas paid. I indicated that I was
invited by former Assistant to the Director J.P. Mohr and
mecall that the November trip cost $30 and the April trip
$35. This money was padd to Hr. J.P. Hohe, and vas paid to
incur the expense of 3 meals and 1 night's lodging. He
asked if I knew the other individuals in attendance. I
indicated that I was introduced to all present but was unable
to recall their professions or with whom-they were associated
other then obviously Bureau personnel. He asked if and when
I became acquainted with Jee Tait of U.S. Recording, I
indicated that I met He. Tait on my initial trip in Novemker,
1974, and again saw him in April, 1075. At that time I was
wnavare with whom Mr. Tait was associated until most recentiy
when it was published that Mr, Tait was, in fact, President
of U.S. Recording Company.

as a guedt to be in the company of associates, merely to 7
socialize and aot to ongage in and discuss official business.

interviewed by HSC Staff Member James Oliphant at the Rayburn
House Office Building, Washington, &. C. There was a court
reporter present to record the interview. Gir. Oliphant stated

another individual appeared in the room, placed SA Campbell
under oath and immediately departed the room. SAs Danny 0.
Coulson and James Stassinos, FBI Legal Counsel Division,
accompanied SA Campbell to the Rayburn Building but were not
present during the actual interview. Approximately one-half way
through the 25 minute interview Oliphant was joined hy Richard 5.
Vermeire, HSC Staff Member. SA Campbell at no time was advised
of his legal rights. £A Campbell requested and was advised he
would receive a transcript containing the results of the interview.

At the outset SA Campbell was asked his narae, address
aud te explain his supervisory duties in connection with his position
as Unit Chief of the Engineering Unit. SA Campbell replied that he

) was made a Unit Chief in May 1975 and his responsibilitios included
~ providing technical assistance to FBI field offices in connection with
¥ investigative matiers.

SA Campbell was then asked if he ever bought anything from
snes ov — U. 8. Recording Company. Mr. Oliphant was advised that the purchase

SA Campbell rarely saw the purchase order but was telephonically
contacted to see if the merchandise had arrived indicating it was
then necessary to pay for the items. SA Campbell in answer to
questions indicated he did not know the profit margin or how the
mark up on equipment was calculated. A "wild guess" requested
by iar. Oliphant was that the mark up was 10-15 or 20 per cont
deponding on the price of the items and the difficulty oncountered
in obtaining the items.

In answer to questions by Mr. Oliphant, SA Campbell
advised he had met Mr. Tait of U. 5. Recording Comapay on
several oceasions in connection with his employment but did not
know him socially. SA Campbell stated he had heard of the Fargo

anything from thom. SA Campbell had heard of Gus Obordick and
that he was 2 distributor of Smith & Wesson firearms,

retired, and had ract him several times since that time. SA Campvell
had purchased some small radio transmitters from Me. Kaiser and
looked at some of his car following equipment. Mr. Kaiser's equip~
ment was satisfactory for the price and in come instances Mr. Kaiser
knew the equipment was being purchased by the FBI,

HSC Staff Members asked if 84 Campbell new John Mohr.
SA Campbell fuenished the following information concorning Mr. Mohr
in response to questions. SA Campboll Imew Mr. Mohr as an FBI
official but did not Inow him socially. He did not hear any rumors
or gossip that indicated there was anything out of the ordinary between
iar, Mohr and Mr. Tait. Even after information appeared in the
newspaper SA Campbell stated he would be very surprised if anything
transpired botweon, them that was ileal. SA Campholl was at
Mr. Mohr‘'s home to holp repair a TV set which he thought was good
security practice ior FBI officials. GA Carapbell never worked on or
heard of any other FBI employees working on any vehicle owned by
Mr. Mohr. SA Campbell did not know if Mr. iiehr obtained anything
from Mr. Tait at a discount. SA Campbell was instructed to go to

Richard Vermeire, Staff Member of the House Select
Committee, on 1/27/76 advised that at 2:30 p.m. on that date
the House Select Committee was going to consider recommendatidn
concerning corrective action or legislation necessary as, deter-
mined by the Committee's review of the FBI. Vermeire said that
two of the recommendations troubled him--one being a recommendation
being made to the Committee by the Staff that warrants be necessary
for the use of informants in the domestic intelligence area based
on a probable cause standard.

Vermeire indicated that both he and Timothy o1ignsfoy-—
Staff Member of captioned Committee, were concerned with this
proposal and considered it totally unworkable. He asked/if'the
Bureau could furnish him orally some suggestions or arguments he
might use to convince the Committee that such a warrant require-
ment is not feasible. He was advised that a determination would
be made by the Bureau concerning this and that he would be re-
contacted.

a recommendation for a new oversight committee being created to
xveview FBI operations. It was pointed out to Vermeire that the
Dixector had testified on oversight and while he was in favor of
the concept, the Bureau was desirous that oversight functions be
consolidated. In this regard, it was pointed out to Vermeire
that there were currently three Committees in the House claiming
oversight responsibilities pertaining to Bureau operations--Sub-
cormittee on Government Information and Individual Rights of the
House Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Civil
and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the J; iar 7

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: HOUSTUDY |

Vermeire was very appreciative of the information
concerning oversight and asked that he be advised as soon as
possible of any arguments or suggestions the Bureau might have
concerning warrant requirements for informants in the domestic
intelligence area.

Contact was made with SA Thomas J. McNiff of the
Intelligence Division, SENSTUDY 75 Staff, and Steven Blackhurst,
Assistant Special Counsel on Intelligence Coordination in the
Department, regarding Vermeire's request and both agreed that it
would be advantageous to furnish suggested arguments concerning
warrant requirements for informants to the House Select Committee.

Attempts were made to telephonically contact Vermeire
on 1/27/76 to furnish him the requested information unsuccess-
fully and on 1/28/76, Vermeire telephonically contacted SA Paul V.
\Daly of this Division. Vermeire was generally advised of the
jproblems presented by the requirement of warrants based on
probable cause for the utilization of information in the domestic
intelligence area. The arguments were as follows:

(Ll) The problem in defining the information being
sought by the informant for the Bureau. It was pointed out
that these investigations are by nature difficult to describe
in scope and that a warrant requirement would seem to require
a specification as to what is being sought.

(2) The use of informants in this area is generally
at a very early stage in the investigation at which time it
would be unlikely there would be @fsufficient information
available to meet a probable cause standard.

(3) If a court were to issue a warrant for the use
of an informant, what procedures would be necessary for the
court to monitor the use of the informant subsequent to their
approval?

(4) It would appear that such a legislative recom-
mendation would be casting the court in a role to which they
are unaccustomed and moving the courts closer and closer to the
very initiation of an investigation.

(5) What arrangements or considerations would have
to be made to protect the identity of an informant wherein a
warrant had been sought?

(6) It was pointed out that there would be great
difficulty in drafting a concise or accurate definition of
domestic intelligence investigations.

Vermeire was very appreciative of the aforementioned
arguments and stated he would use these in an attempt to explain
to the Committee the difficulty presented by legislation in this
area.

As you are aware, on December 31, 1975, SA Royce ais
V. Colby, Radio Engineering Section, FBI Laboratory
appeared, as requested, at the offices of captioned mh
committee.

SA Colby was questioned under oath by staff RAN
members Richard Vermiere and Tim Oliphant, and the testimony ae
was tecorded by a court reporter.

\
The purpose of this memorandum is to advise ar :
make a matter of record an "incident" which happened i .
connection with the above testimony. The room which was =
to be used for the interview was being occupied by a staff
member using the telephone. When staff member completed :
his telephone conversation he departed leaving the room
available for Mr. Veriilere, Oliphant and Colby. Upon
entering the room following Mr. Oliphant SA Colby noticed
a crunched-up dollar bill lying on the floor just inside
the door of the interview room. SA Colby picked the money
up and gave it to Mr. Oliphant who at the same time asked
if Colby had dropped it. Colby replied that he did not
think the money belonged to him since he normally did not
carry loose bills in his pocket. Oliphant then handed
the dollar to Mr. Verthtexewho departed from the room to
determine if the previous occupant had dropped the bill.

interviewed. "If the person claims the money, then we
know his testimony will be suspect." At this point the
court reporter entered the room followed by Mr. Vermiere
and Mr. Oliphant immediately commenced the interview.

No further reference to the dollar bill was made by any
of the staff members including Mr. Vermiere who apparently
had returned the dollar bill to the departed staff member.

SA Colby feels since he had no opportunity to
pursue the statements made by Mr. Oliphant that it would
be difficult to establish whether Mr. Oliphant was
"joking" or whether this was in fact a "trick" to
establish the credibility of SA Colby's testimony.
However, it is felt that the details of this encounter
should be brought to the attention of the Bureau for
information in the event similar tactics are employed
by House Select Committee staff.

*eut-out" or confidential source for procurement purposes.
Questions were asked concerning the price mark-up applied by
U. S. Recording and whether SA Perritte had any knowledge of
improper conduct by Bureau personnel in connection with
purchases made from U. S. Recording. SA Perritte was also
asked whether he had any knowledge of purchases from Gus |
Oberdick or the Fargo Company. SA Perritte was asked whether
he had any knowledge, or had heard any rumors concerning the
development of a "bottle cap" being developed by Laboratory
personnel and subsequently patented by Mr. Tolson. SA Perritte
advised the staff members that he had no information concerning
any of the above matters.

activities at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, SA Kirsch
advised that he had attended two such gatherings primarily
composed of Bureau personnel {present and former) during
early 1974, the first such occasion being in January or
February and the second a few months later, probably April,
: 1974, In response to Mr. Sliphant's question as to who

for meals and ledging at Harper's Ferry and SA Kirsch

excessive and probably $12 to $15 covered the entire affair.
Certainly no more than $20 was expended at either of the
\ two outings by SA Kirsch. SA Kirsch did not recall exactly
: whe cellected for the meals but believes it was probably
Mr. John Mohr. Mr. Mliphant asked what the table stakes

In response to questioning Li. Cochran advised Messrs.

Ir, Cochran advised them that the ceneral procedure for
procuring technical equipment is as follows: the Laboratory is
rospousible for speeliying and recomracading the purchase of alt
technical equipment based upon our imowledge of the "state of the
art" ond an existing need of tae Dureav for particular equipment.
‘This need and justification toyether wita specifications for tha

Messrs. Oliphant and Vermeire ingvircd as to whethor or

the Laboratory for verification and justification of the reasonableness
of any mark-up occasioned by the use of confidential channels of

the Laboratory does not have occasion to see the actual payment
order issued for the equipment purchased under these circumstances.
They inquired if Mr. Cochran {clt a system of requiring Laboratory review of
confidential procurement mark-ups would be desirable from the standpoint
of ensuring they wore reaconable and justified. Mx, Cochran siated the
Laboratory's position is that such mark-ups are not oceasioned by technical .
considerations, but are based on an operational nced falling within the
procurement responsibility of the Administrative Division. In these
cireurnstances we are paying for a corvice - confidentiality. The fact
that past exporicace with U. 5. Recording Company has been highly
favorable in terms of fringe benefits - warranty service, prorapt
repnirs, procurement of cearce items, and the like - are important
factors, but not the main concern in determining reasonableness of
any mark-up.

Adams. was interviewed by Tim Oliphant of the House Select Committee
on on Intelligence in the presence of Special Agent John Dennis Miller
of the FBI Legal Counsel Division. The stated purpose of the interview
was concerning Mr. Adams' attendance at a poker game at the Biue
Ridge Rod and Gun Club, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

Mr. Adams reported that at the invitation of former Assistant
to the Director John P. Mohr he attended one of the social gatherings
during the first half of 1974. He could not provide the exact date but
believed it was in the spring of 1974, The guests arrived Friday evening
and departed around Saturday noon. The expenses were shared by the
participants, Mr. Adams recalling that immediately upon arriving
Friday evening he was met at the door by Mr. Mobr who advised
Mr. Adams that Mir. Adams’ share of the expenses was $25. This amount
was paid in cash immediately upon arriving and was to cover the cost of
the dinner Friday night, breakfast Saturday morning, a snack at Saturday
noon, and lodging,

There were a number of guests present including present and
former FBI employees and present and former Central intelligence Agency
employees as well as other present or former Government employees. It
was strictly a social affair and no business was discussed.

—— Although such outings had taken place over a period of time,

cer AD in. ‘his was the first and only attendance by Mr. Adams. It was Mr. Adams’

INTERVIGW OF ASSETANT TO THE DIRECTOR JAMES B, ADAMS
BY Thi OLIPHANT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTSE ON INTSLLIGENCE
CONCERNING U. S. RECORDING COMPANY

In response to questions, Mir, Adams advised that he did not
believe ho had ever hoard of tho U. S. Recording Company until recently,
nor was he specifically aware of Na. Toit's employment with that Company.
He was aware that Mr. Oberdick represented Federal Laboratories and
believed he had been aware of such fact for several years. He believed
he had met Mir. Tait and Mr. Oberdick sometime after commencing his
assignment to Mr. Mohr's offico as Inspector and Numbor One Man in
April, 1971. Ue recalled both had visited My. Mohr's offico, he having
secn them in the reception rcom on a couple of occasions. It was pointed
out thot Air, Adams’ office and desk at that timo were located in such a
manner that he was unable to see visitors entering or leaving the reception
room, located between Mr, Mohr's office and Mr. Adams" office.

Mr. Adams outlined his assignments at FBI Headquarters and
pointed out that these assignments would not have involved him in
procurement matters, even while assigned to Ma. Mohr's office from
April, 1971, until July, 1972. There was a delineation of work assign~
ments to facilitate the flow of mail whercby Lair. Adams did not as a matter
of course review matters going in to Mr, Molr from subordinate divisions
unless such matters fell within the purview of Mir. Adams' responsibilities.
Purchase matters and procurcracnt mattors were not included among
Mr. Adams' responsibilities. Furthermore, when Mr. Mohr would be on
leave he would be relieved by one of the Assistant Directors under his
suporvision, gonorally Mir. Callahan of the Administrative Division.
Accordingly, during the normal course of business Mr. Adams would have
had no occasion to sce any matters portaining to U. 8. Recording Company
and he has no recollection of ever having seen such or beon avare of any
activities of that Company until just recently.

Mr. Adams was asked concerning recent publicity to the effect
that certain filos might have beon removed from Mr. Hoover's office and
taken up to the Blue Ridge Club for burning and he advised that he had
absolutely no knowledge whatsoever concernin? any such alleged activity.
He pointed out that a thorouzh inspection inquiry had boen conducted with
statements being taken under oath from all pertinent parties without
developing any information that any official files had boon removed from
Mr. Hoover's office and destroyed surreptitiously. Nar. Adams expressed
the hope that the House Committee might see fit to subpoena the writer of
such articles and attempt to force him to reveal the source of tho allegations
in order that the matter micht be further resolved,

on Intelligence on December 9, 1975, The purpose of the interview was
essentially to develop my attendance at the Blue Ridge Rod and Gun Club,
Hillskoro, Virginia. Mr, Oliphant briefly advised me how my name was.

which John Mohr had identified as attendees at the Club for the purpose
of playing poker.

Mr. Oliphant asked me how many times I had been up to the Chub.
I indicated I wasn't quite sure but would estimate that it was hetween six
and cight occasions, commencing approximately in 1970. Itold
Mr. Oliphant that the invitation vas usually extended by Mr. Mohr and
each attendee was requested to share the cost. 1 told him that I paid $25
on each occasion except for the last one which wag $36. This fee covered
ropm and board, and beverage if one desired, for Friday night and
Saturday morning. Payment was made directly to Mr, Mobr immediately
upon arrival.

Mz. Oliphant asied if I knew who the member of the Club was
and i responded that while I did not know on my initial attendance I did
subsequently Icarn that Mir. Joseph Tait was a Club member. He asked
if Iwas aware Mr. Tait was connected with the J, 8. Recording Company
and I said I was not aware of this relationship until I read it in the news~
papers. Myr, Gliphant then asked if I knew what Gus Okerdick did for a
living and i told him I did not become aware of Mx. Oberdick's employment
until eae day I bappened to see his narne along with Fargo Division while
driving in the Kensington, Maryland, area. Since his name was an unusual
one, I made inquiries as to whether this Ocerdick was identical to Gus
Oberdick and was advised that he was.

Mr. Oliphant queried as to whether or not there were ether
individuals who wore not current or former Burcau employees or
current or retired Govornmont employcos who attended tho Club. I
teld him the only individeal I could thin’: of off hand who would fit that
category was dco Eisenmann who I believed was with Lietro.

Bit. Oliphant then told me it was his belief that Mir. Eigonmonn was
eonneeted with the Government. Iwas asked if any business was
conducted during these poler offairs and I told him I did not and could
not recall business being conducted. They were purely social affairs.

Mr. Oliphant asked hoy long I had been assigned to tho
Administrative Division and I replied from Lay, 1961, until my desig-
notion as ii. Jontzins' assistant in April, 1075. 1 told hima thet the
major portion of my career in the Administrative Division was in the
Personnel Section and thot it was not until my assignment as
Myr, Walsh's deputy in September, 1973, that { had any sugervisory
responsibilities with respect to the other sections in tho Administrative
Division. Mix, Oliphant asked for the dates of my assiemment as
My. Walsh's doputy end ray checl: with the Persoanel Section determined
the dates te be September 6, 1973, to April 8, 1975. I explained to
hiv. Oliphant that even thouch I participated in the overall management of
the Division, Mr. Walsh assumed princival responsibility of the
Procurement and Administrative Services Section. Bir. Oliphant aaked
if I could reenll approving any contracts involving U.S. Recording
Company and [ advised I could not. I explained to him that I was not a
Contracting Officer and if I had approved the action of a Contracting
Gificex I relied on the fact that the equipment requested was justified
and that we had sufficient funds to pay for same prior to the letting of the
bid or purchase of tho equipment.

hir. Oliphant indicated to me that everyone he had talked to to
Gate had related substantially the same information eoncorning the pokey
affairs. He was vory cordial during the interview and thanked me for
the information furaished.

experienced difficulty understanding the difference

ir. Walsh recalled nnly one eonfidential contract which
he had signed as enntracting officer with U. S. Reearding
Company and that contract was executed in June, 1975,
in the appreximate ameunt nf $168,000. Mr. Walsh stated

and Lepartnent ef Justice guidelines and that the
eontract had been personally approved by the Attorney

his understanding that the mark-up generally vould mt

and that he had never made a survey to determine the

ordering technical equipment and the use of U.S.
Recording Company as a souree for such equipment.
Following a diseussion of the Section's use of
Xequisitions, the staff members wanted to know if
there was an aceepted mark-up allewed U.S. Recording
for providing confidentiality and whether SA Vilgus
had any information, rumor or otherwise, concerning
ale. Oberdick (phonetic), the Targo Gompany, whether
Mr. Mohr or his family ever received goods or services
fron Mr. Tate (phonetic) of U.S. Recording, and
anything about a bottie-capping imvention involving
ur. Parsons for which Mr. Tolsén received a patent.
SA VWileus advised the staff members that he had no
information about any of these matters.

IN CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

INPRODUCTION . : -

Our investigation showed that intelligence
connected proprietaries have been established by the
Army, Navy and Air Force within the Department of :
Defense and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

“Although the Department of State has an intelligence

gathering mission, the Départment advised the com-
mittee that proprietaries nd never been used as a
front in their intelligence gathering activities.

The proprietaries owned by the Militaty Services
and the FBI were established to provide a method of
gathering raw intelligence data or to support the

A *clandestine activities of U.S. agents in such a man-
feuee that any direct-connection between the U.S.

neeeeesir The FBI utilizes proprietaries in both the for-
eign counterintelligence and criminal fields. In

the former, proprietaries are operated for the purpose
of collecting raw foreign counterintelligence infor-
mation, training of personnel and testing of equip-
ment. In criminal matters, the FBI has, on occasion,

« operated proprietaries for the purpose of collecting
