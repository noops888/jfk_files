PROPOSED MEETING WITH CONGRESSMAN JOHN ROWLAND (R-CT)

MEMBER HOUSE PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

(HPSCI)

House

PURPOSE: To advise of a tentatively scheduled meeting with

Congressman ROWLAND and to seek the DIRECTOR's approval for the

meeting.

DETAILS: On 8/10/89, Congressman ROWLAND, who was appointed to

uPSCI in January, 1989, visited the New York Office to learn more of

the FBI's effort

in counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and drug

enforcement.

During that visit, legislative initiatives were

discussed.

There was not, however, sufficient time to discuss

counterintelligence legislative proposals.

Congressman ROWLAND thus

asked the Congressional Affairs Office (CAO) representative if a

follow-up meeting could be scheduled to discuss the FBI's counter-

intelligence legislative needs in September, 1989.

A briefing has tentatively been scheduled for 9/20/89 at

11 a.m. in Room H405 - Capitol.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. That SSAS MONTE C. STRAIT and JOHN S.

brief Congressman ROWLAND on 9/20/89 at 11 a.m

Re: Report on Allegations Appearing in

October 14 - 15, 1979, Editions of

024 89 59,

The Chicago Sun-Times Newspaper

DETAILS:

On 1/3/80, SAs Emil Moschella, Legal Counsel

DiVision, and Jim Sturgis, Intelligence

Division, met with

Thomas Lattemer, Staff Director, House Permanent Committee

on Intelligence, at his request, regarding the recent FBI

submission to the Conmittee of a review on analysis of the

case captioned "Report on Allegations Appearing in the

October 14, 15, 1979, Editions of the Chicago 'Sun-Times'

Newspaper; Review of

Pending Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI) Double Agent Operations, October 1, 1977, to the

President." It is noted that the Committee had taken

testimony on the matter of this double agent on October 16,

1979, and the Committee made several requests for information

in the area. (S)

Mr. Lattemer advised that it was the opinion of

one of the members that a plece of requested information

had not been directly addressed in our response and he

therefore made a request for the specific item. Mr. Lattemer

said that the item appears on pages 34 - 35 of the hearing

transcript and that the requested analysis should compare all

of the items passed by the double agent over the term of his

operation with the information received by the FBI from the

double agent so that one may be weighed against the other

in a kind of "cost/benefit ratio." (S)

Mr. Lattemer requested that the analysis be in his

hands prior to the first Committee meeting which is scheduled

for 1/23/80. (C)

MEMORANDUM TO MESSRS. ADAMS

MC DERMOTT

Prior to the closed session meeting of the House -

Intelligence Committee at 3:30 p.m. this alternoon I advised

the Attorney General that, as a result of the recent

inspection of the New York Office, ve had discovered that

some firetap records were not kept in accordance with regula-

cions with the result that the indices may have been in-

complete at the time that affidavits were submitted on the

question of whether various individuals had or had not been

overheard during such taps.

I told him that our tentative

assessment was that ve would find very few additional names

but that

it would take considerable effort to nail it down.

This prompted the Attorney General to tell me that

he understood Mx. LaPrade had testified or been interviewed

on the Hill regarding his foreign counterintelligence concerns

and at that time described a procedure which worried him.

stated that in making caps on Telex lines the company (RCA)

would not cooperate and it was therefore necessary for the

Special Agent to run tests on various lines until he found

seal can be procured in the Philippines for $50 or less. If so,

arrange to have one seal carved. You may loan the 21-inch seal in

your office to the woodcarvers temporarily for this purpose.

If you are able to obtain the desired seal, forward it to

PURPOSE:

To recommend priority attention be given to preparation of

video tapes which are to support presentations before Senate and House

Select Committees on Intelligence during January and February, 1978.

DETAILS:

During early February, 1978, an appearance by either

Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams or Assistant Director

T. W. Leavitt is planned before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence;

in addition, the House Select Committee on Intelligence will be similarly

briefed in the near future. In order to aramatize graphically the constant

threat to national security posed by Hostile Intelligence Services, a video-

tape presentation of approximately 20 minutes is felt to be most desirable,

Senate staff members have specifically requested such a film as one of

the most effective ways to dramatize our problems for the Senators.

at the present time, the Instructional Technological Services

Staff, Training Division, have advised the Intelligence Division (INTD)

they have a number of important projects; but, in view of the short dead-

lines for the preparation of a suitable presentation, INTD believes that

this project should be given priority status

PURPOSE:

To confirm Director's authorization to prepare hand-painted

FBl seal suitable for mounting on wall of the hearing room (H-405) of

the HSCI.

DETAILS:

NW

5010-114

55319

During testimony before the HSCI on 1/19/78, the Committee

Chairman, Rep. Edward P. Boland, requested that I arrange for an EBl

seal to be placed on the wall together with the seals of the other five

members of the Intelligence Community which are already there.

The seals of the other agencies are all 15' in diameter.

Available FBI seals are either 9" (all gold) or 21" (full color) in diameter.

The Director orally authorized the hand painting of a 9" seal to be mounted

on a 15" wooden base appropriately finished. The Special Projects Section,

Laboratory Division, has observed seals now in the hearing room and can

prepare a suitable FBl seal and base.

To obtain a 15" seal presenting an appearance more comparable

to the other seals through regular channels would be prohibitively expensive.

Making a mold, alone, would cost about $1, 000. However, a hand-carved

15" seal can be made in the Philippines through Legat, Manila. The cost

would probably run less than $50. The time to obtain would run 60-90 days

and it is, therefore, not a viable alternative to installing, initially, the

g" seal on 15" base but offers a better long-range solution to the HSCI

Chairman's request.

DETAILS:

House

On 1/4/77, Congressman Charles E. Bennett (Florida) submitted

House Resolution 82, the purpose being to establish a new select committee

of the House to be known as the Select Committee on Intelligence, to oversee

and make studies of intelligence activities and programs of the United States

Government. This Resolution is similar in nature to Senate Resolution 400,

94th Congress, Second Session, which created the Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence. If created by the House, this Committee would obtain po

annual reports from the Director of the CIA, the Secretary of State, Secre-

tary of Defense, and the Director of the FBI concerning intelligence activities.

This Committee would also submit to the Committee on the Budget views

and estimates regarding matters within the jurisdiction of this Select Committe?

This Select Committee would also require the head of each

department and agency of the United States to keep the Select Committee

fully and currently informed with respect to intelligence activities, including

any significant anticipated activity, provided that it did not constitute a

condition precedent to the implementation of any such anticipated intelligence

activity.

Page 9, line 1, of this Resolution provides "that the head of

any department or agency of the United States involved in any intelligence

activities should furnish any information or document in the possession,

custody, or control of the department or agency, or person paid by such

department or agency whenever requested by the select committee with

respect to any matter within such committee's jurisdiction." It should be

noted that Senate Resolution 400, 94th Congress, Second Session, was

silent regarding this type of access. This Select Committee would also

ce, Second Sessiona as

look into the desirability of establishing a standing committee of the House

on Intelligence Activities, the desirability of establishing a joint committee

ot the Senate and the House of Representatives on intelligence activities, or'

of establishing procedures under which separate committee on intelligence

activities of the two Houses of Congress would receive joint briefings by

the intelligence agencies and coordinate their policies with respect to

safeguarding of sensitive intelligence information.

This Resolution was referred to the Committee on Rules for

consideration.

CIA Review Staff and Mitchell Rogovin, formerly Special Counsel

7/25/76 at public hearings of Ethics Committee.

From questions already asked of other witnesses, it

is anticipated Bolten and Rogovin will be asked if CIA investi-

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re:

HOUS TUDY

Pursuant to Department letter 2/13/76, "Disclosure

and Publication of Allegedly Classified Information by The

Village Voice," on or about 2/11/76," we have been conducting

a preliminary inquiry in this matter along lines specified by

the Department. After conferring with Messrs. J. B. Adams and

J. A. Mintz, it was decided that CIA be told that we would

prefer that mention of FBI not be volunteered by Bolten or

Rogovin. However, if questioned specifically as to any FBI

investigation or if asked such general questions as indicated

above, we would have no objection to the following reply:

is our understanding that the FBI, at the instructions of the

Department of Justice, initiated

• a preliminary inquiry into

this matter in February, 1976."

The foregoing was telephonically passed by Phillips

to Hunt, in Bolten's absence, on 7/23/76.

The desired reply in

quotes immediately above was read to Hunt who reread it back

for accuracy.

He expressed agreement with the handling of the

matter in this manner and expressed appreciation for our

cooperation.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Houstudy

62-116464

/JEK Act 6 (1) (B)

DETAILS:

On 5/18/76 Mr. August Fipp, investigator for the Standards of

Official Conduct Committee of the House, interviewed you and me in your

office concerning the Bureau's handling of the first version of the final draft

report of the HSC, which version was received by INTD on 1/20/76.

Mr. Fipp was furnished the following information, which to the

best of my recollection was the way in which this was handled by INTD.

At approximately 5 p.m. on 1/20/76 SA Dalseg received from

Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, two copies of

the draft report. SA Dalseg furnished these two copies to then Assistant

Director Wannall who in turn appointed me to coordinate the review of the

report, which consisted of approximately 340 pages, for classified material

and any errors concerning information furnished by the Bureau to the HSC.

This review was to be accomplished by 9 p.m. 1/20/76 and the results

furnished to

Jat CIA. Based on Mr. Wannall's instructions,

each Section Chief, INTD, was assigned approximately 50 pages to review.

SA Ryan was assigned the task of reviewing the Cointelpro portions of the

report and, as the report contained considerable information concerning the

U. S. Recording Company, the Inspection Division was requested to review

that portion of the report.

Tom Hardy, a former informant handled by

General Investigative Division, had been interviewed by the Committee.

Accordingly, General Investigative Division was requested to review that

portion of the report. As former SA Arthur Murtagh had testified before

the Committee and made a number of allegations concerning the Bureau, a

portion of the report was referred to the Finance and Personnel Division

for review.

With the short deadline imposed, five Xerox copies of the report

were made making a total of seven copies of the report in the possession of

PURPOSE:

To advise that on 4/29/76 Mr. Norman McDaniels

Director Soc'y -

(former SA), a member of the investigating staff looking into the

leak of the House Select Committee Intelligence Report, telephonically )

contacted Deputy Associate Director Adams for the purpose of ob-

taining information regarding the Bureau's knowledge of the drafts of

the House Select Committee Intelligence report.

DETAILS:

On 4/29/76 Mr. Norman McDaniels (former SA), a member

of the investigating staff looking into the leak'. of the House Select Com-

mittee Intelligence Report, telephonically contacted Deputy Associate

Director Adams indicating he desired to meet with representatives of the

Bureau in an effort to determine what knowledge the Bureau had regarding

the disposition of the reports of the House Select Intelligence Committee.

Alter conferring with Assistant Director Mintz it was agreed

that Deputy Assistant Director Cregar would contact McDaniels telephoni-

cally and advise him that his request should be submitted in writing to the

Attorney General over the signature of the Chairman of the Committee

looking into this matter.

This was done on the afternoon of 4/29/76

and McDaniels said that he would definitely be contacting the Attorney

General's Office but probably would do so by telephone rather than in

writing. Cregar advised McDaniels that the Bureau would take no further

action in this matter pending advice from the Attorney General's Office.

McDaniels agreed with this arrangement.

JEK Act 6 (1) (B)

It will be recalled that on the morning of Saturday, 1/24/76,

the secretary ofL

the attorney hired by William Colby,

then Director of Central Intelligence Agency, telephonically contacted

Cregar in an effort to arrange delivery of the "final report of the House

Select Intelligence Committee to the Attorney General." The secretary

indicated that the Attorney General needed the report inasmuch as the

report was to be discussed at the White House the following day and the

should be furnished to the FBI foR appropritt-aling: 2-116464-318

These documents are not the Pike Committee report which

RECOMMENDATION Or HON. MORGAN F. MURPITY

In light of the investigation by the House Select Committee on In-

telligence, I recommend that Congress enact legislation or amend exist-

ing legislation to protect the confidentiality of tax records of American

citizens.

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code refers to tax returns as

"public records" but specifies that they be "open to inspection only

upon order of the President and under rules and reculations pre-

scribed by the Secretary or his delegate and approved by the

Public use and abuse of the records, however, have been more the

rule than the exception in the recent past. There has been little em-

phasis on the need for protecting the confidentiality of tax records.

I recommend a shift in emphasis back to the basic right of taxpayers

to privacy regarding their tax affairs. We must do more than limit dis-

closures to certain agencies, individuals, congressional committees, and

States. We must require the entity seeking tax information to prove

that such information is essential to the entity's function and further,

that the tax information cannot otherwise be acquired. I suggest that

House and Senate committees with jurisdiction act with all deliberate

speed to finalize their work on legislation to better ensure the privacy

of tax records.

MORGAN F. MURPHY.

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION OF HON. JAMES V. STANTON

Affairs be prohioited from holding any Cabinet-level position, by rec-

ommending the enactment of legislation which (1) states that the

individual who holds this position cannot hold any other office in the

(2) requires Senate confirmation of this position, and (3) in order to

chieve these purposes, establishes statutorily the position of Special

Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. I have intro-

duced a bill, H.R. 10754, which embodies these provisions.

ALTERATIVE RECONENDATIONS OF HOY. ROBERT MOCLORY

I support the recommendations contained in the majority report

under headings: D, E, G, 1,d, L, NO, 2, h, ands (with the exception

of section 1). I do not approve of the other recommendations and I

offer the following alternative recommendations in those areas in which

I believe reform is necessary and appropriate.

ALIERNATIVE RECOMMINDATIONS OF HON. ROBIRT MOCORT

I recommend that there be established a permanent standing Com-

2. No member of the committee may serve more than 3 consecutive

terms on the committee, and no member of the staff may serve more

than 6 consecutive years.

3. Any past or current member of the committee staff who shall re-

lease, without authorization of the committee, materials or informa-

tion obtained by the committee shall be immediately terminated from

employment and shall be fully subject to criminal and civil liability,

notwithstanding legislative immunity.

The committee's jurisdiction shall include all legislative and

oversight functions relating to all U.S. agencies and departments en-

gaged in foreign or domestic intelligence activities. The committee

shall have exclusive jurisdiction for budget authorization for all in-

telligence activities and exclusive jurisdiction for all covert action op-

erations. All remaining oversight functions may be concurrent with

other committees of the House.

these projects involved illegalities and abuses by the intelligence divi-

I would only comment here that our system is grossly misused when

Federal agencies violate the law in their attempts to enforce it.

To

adopt the methods of criminals is to become indistinguishable from

them.

RECOMMENDATIONS

I strongly support the committee's recommendation that no mem

ser of the House serve on the new oversight committee we propose fo

more than 6 years. Such a limitation will help to ensure that the com-

mittee's members retain their objectivity and not come to look on the

intelligence community as their own private preserve.

A similar limitation should be imposed on the Directors of the CIA

and FBI, so that neither is allowed to serve for so many years that he

can no longer distinguish between himself and his job

One of the committee's recommendations would require the FBI

agents or informants have a judicial warrant before attempting to in-

filtrate any domestic group or association. I agree that this require-

ment is necessary to protect the rights of American atizens, but, in

light of recent tragedies perpetrated by international terrorists groups,

I feel that such a restriction should not be imposed when the grour

or association is wholly or partly made up of aliens.

SUMMARY

In comparison with other intelligence agencies, and, indeed, with

Hovernment agencies in general, I find the CIA to be highly profes-

sional and very dedicated. Despite past lack of accountability, the

CIA is doing a high level, cost effective job, particularly in its intelli-

gence gathering function.

However, there are serious deficiencies in the operation of the ClA.

luch constructive rebuilding must be done if American intelligenc

ctivities are to be conducted with responsibility and integrity-an

without undermining the spirit of our democratic society.

BILL LEHMAN.

RECOMMIENDATIONS OF HON. DALE MILFORD

A. A HOUSE COMMITICE ON INTELLIGENCE

1. I recommend that there be formed a standing Committee on In-

telligence of the House of Representatives, and that committee shall

consist of members who hold the respect and confidence of the general

membership of the House.

a. The membership of the standing Committee on Intelligence shall

be selected from sitting members of the following House committees:

2 Members from Armed Services.

2 Members from Internal Relations.

1 Member from Science and Technology.

1 Member from Banking and Currency.

1 Member from Judiciary.

our tradition of an open society, as well as this Nation's moral position

throughout the world. For, if this Nation does not maintain that moral

position, there is now no other country in the world who can take our

If I were CIA Director, I would be happy to see a strong congres-

sional oversight committee, because it would be the most effective safe-

guard against wrongly conceived and wrongly motivated covert ac-

tions originating in the executive branch.

Despite allegations to the contrary, congressional investigations

have not prevented the Agency from doing an effective job. Past per-

formance bears this out; in tact, the tailure of the CIA and other in-

telligence agencies to give adequate warning of several international

crises may simply indicate the limited ability of intelligence to safe-

guard our national security.

There was, for example, the October 1973, Mideast war,

where there

was more than enough information available to warn of the impend-

ing Arab attack. There were other failures as well: the 1974 coup in

Cyprus and the subsequent Turkish invasion; the Indian nuclear ex

plosion; the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia; the Tet offensive in

Vietnam; and the leftist coup in Portugal. All of these "failures" oc-

curred long before any congressional committee was directed to in-

vestigate the intelligence community.

The intelligence community has operated in the past with a virtual

blank check budget. This not only removes any incentive to curtail

wasteful programs, but, through the very availability of funds, leads

to both foolish and dangerous covert operations.

Yet, I am concerned by the committee's recommendation that a line-

item figure for the CIA appear in the budget. Is it really possible to

get a true and accurate figure? In the event that one of the branches

of the armed services details a vessel to the CIA, is the cost of that

vessel a part of the costs of intelligence? In my view, a line-item fig-

ure for the Agency must conform to principles of sound accounting

practice. Only then will it have any meaning at all.

The committee hearings on the FBI documented the problem of in-

ormants turned agents-provocateur. Informants are necessary; th

ise of provocateurs is totally contrary to principles of decency an

nembers of the chapter. As such, he allegedly suggested violent mean:

mental to the national security of the United States, the material

would not be disclosed or released. Failing any such Presidential

certification, the committee would be able to release the material.

(d) In the event of such a certification by the President, the

committee shall be given standing to sue and the U.S. District

Court for the District of Columbia shall be given jurisdiction

over such disputes, so that the matter can be submitted to the

courts for judicial determination.

C. COVERT ACTION

1. I recommend that all activities involving direct or indirect at-

tempts to assassinate any individual be prohibited by law except in

time of war.

2. I recommend that appropriate legislation be enacted to require

prior approval by the House Committee on Intelligence for all mili-

tary and paramilitary covert actions proposed by the U.S. Govern-

ment, including those actions in which arms or funds for arms would

be provided covertly.

3. I recommend that, as to all other covert actions of a significant

size or involving significant risk, the Director of Central Intelligence

be required, within to hours of initial implementation, to notity

the committee in writing and in detail of the nature, extent, purpose,

risk and costs of the operation.

D. IMPROVED SECURITI FOR CLASSITIED INFORMATION IN THE HOUSE

1. I recommend that the Rules of the House be revised to provide

that any member who violates the confidentiality of any executive

session of any House committee may be censured or expelled by a two-

thirds vote of the House.

2. I recommend that the rules of the House be amended to provide

that any committee of the Flouse which has access to classified infor-

mation has the authority to discipline any member which it reason-

bly believes has disclosed or publicized such intormation in violation

of the rules of confidentiality duly adopted by such committee. Thes

It seems to me that whatever action this country takes in a world

that is becoming this small and this interdependent ought to be overt

action. The United States ought to begin to play an aggressive role as

an advocate of peace in the world, as an advocate of humanitarian

concerns, and frankly I believe that the level of secrecy that we have

been exposed to as members of this committee flies in the face of

democratic principle.

Many people conveniently irap themselves quite fully in the flag;

but when pressed to the wall on whether

or not they are willing

seriously to support democratic principles, I find that they are willing

to sidestep principle.

Democracy is based on a notion of the development of a consensus.

In my estimation covert action does not provide for that consensus.

It does not provide for debate needed to achieve consensus. Instead,

covert actions are recommended and approved by a small select group

I people. The actions can at some point be extremely expensive, al

some point extraordinarily risky and

at some point fly in the face 0i

pen debate on any given question. I think that detrimental to the

not sure that many of us truly believe in the concept of majority rule.

I am concerned about secretly providing arms and aid to other

countries, presicents able to sit cown with other presidents and making

deals. Yet these things are issues we found that are part of the range

of covert actions utilized by this country.

I think our world is much too complicated to continue to function

effectively in this manner. The more we get involved in covert action,

the more ive become accused of covert actions in places where we may

not be involved at all.

So, the question is, does it really assist this country's role in the

world to continue these kind of activities. My answer is no. Indeed,

I think we do much more harm continuing to function covertly.

Many of these operations are well-known except to the people of the

States and/or their representatives. So where does the covert rationale

apply? It keeps people who are part of this society out of the decision,

and it comes at a level which keeps representatives of the people out

of those decisions.

I see no justification for covert operations. If we want to assist,

then why not do it in the open and let the debate deal with the ques-

tion of what our role "ought" to be somewhere in the world. On the

basis of a consensus publicly made, then we can assist. But why do we

have to play games? Why do we have to get involved?

Another related question is where have covert operations taken us?

Are the nations that we have been involved with free democratic

societies where the masses of people have benefits of democracy, or are

hose nations for the most part, military dictators, right-wing tuntas

or regimes with extraordinary wealth and power in the hands of a few

Recommendation No. 3: Access to and Release of Classified Infor-

I recommend that the rules of the House and Senate, where neces-

sary, be conformed to accommodate the following recommendations,

and that, where necessary, legislation be enacted in aid thereot:

(a) Access to information and materials furnished to the joint

committee in executive session or classified secret by the execu-

tive branch shall not be accessible to other members of Congress

except upon a resolution permitting such access adopted by a

two-thirds vote of the membership of both the House and Senate

Members, voting in person and not by proxy.

(6) Prior to any action to permit access of such information to

other Members of Congress, the executive branch shall be given

reasonable opportunity to testify and present evidence in execu-

tive session regarding the proposed action.

(c) Materials and information received from the executive

branch in executive session of the joint committee or otherwise

classified secret by the executive branch may be publicly released

only upon adoption of the resolution specified in subparagraph

(a) above and upon the adoption of a resolution permitting pub-

lic disclosure adopted by a two-thirds vote of the membership of

both the House and Senate, the debate on which shall be conducted

in secret session, and the vote on which shall be in open session by

recorded vote.

(d) Any Member of Congress who reveals any information in

violation of the foregoing

procedures may be censured or er-

pelled by a two-third vote of the House or the Senate, as the case

Recommendation No. 4: Agreements for the Handling of Classified

Information

I recommend that any information furnished to the joint committee

by the executive branch under an agreement with the joint committee

for the handling of such information shall be binding in accordance

with the terms of that agreement on the joint committee, on the flouse

and Senate, and on each Member of Congress. Violation of the terms

of the agreement shall be grounds for censure or expulsion by a two-

thirds vote of the Flouse or Senate, as the case may be.

Recommendation No. 5: Director of Central Intelligence

I recommend that a Director of Central Intelligence shall be estab-

lished, separate from any of the operating intelligence agencies, for

the purpose of coordinating and overseeing the foreign intelligence

ommunity. His purpose shall be to eliminate duplication in collectior

## Page 73

d) The DCI may not hold any other position, office or title in the

U.S. Government.

(e) The DCI shall, along with such other duties, constitute an office

of Inspector General for all of the foreign intelligence agencies,

cluding all agencies of Government which have foreign intelligence

functions. Such agency shall have the obligation to report all allega-

tions of misconduct and/or unlawful activities to the DCI.

(t) The DCI shall be responsible for the national intelligence esti-

mates and daily briefings of the President.

(g) The DCI shall be responsible for reporting to the Joint Com-

mittee on Intelligence and other appropriate committees of Congress.

(k) All budget requests which include funds for foreign intelligence

or covert activities shall, insofar as such funds are concerned, be pre-

pared in consultation with the DCl. Although the funds for toreign

intelligence activities will continue to be budgeted in the respective

agency budgets, the DCI shall be responsible to the joint committee for

full reporting on the foreign intelligence and covert activities funding

(i) The DI shall coordinate the functions of all foreign intelli

mple agencies under lis jurisdiction, shall eliminate unnecessary

conduct periodic evaluation of the performance and

efficiency of the agencies, and report to Congress on the foregoing at

least annually.

Recommendation No. 6: Disclosures to C'ongress

I recommend that existing law (Sec. 102(d) 3 of the National Secu-

rity Act of 1947) which restricts officials of the executive branch from

providing information be amended to specifically exclude from any

such prohibition all committees of Congress having appropriate juris-

diction.

Recommendation No.Y: Assistant for National Security Affairs

I recommend that the Assistant to the President for National Secu-

, rity Affairs be prohibited from holding any other position, office or

title in the U.S. Government.

Recommendation No. 8: News Media and Publications

(1) I recommend that U.S. foreign intelligence agencies be pro-

from utilizing such individuals for purposes of cover; except that such

(2) I recommend that the U.S. intelligence agencies be prohibited

trom the covert publication of books articles or stories in any journals

or electronic media with general circulation in the United States.

Recommendation No. 9: Classification

I recommend that the classification and declassification of informa-

tion be the subject of specific legislation by the Congress.

I recommend that the Director of the FBI have a term of office of

recon, dations should stimulate ext smoly i stant and

questions as :

(1) Is secrecy compatible with principles of democracy osten-

sibly embodied in our constitutional form of government:

2) If and where is secrecy necessary?

3) How much secrecy is required and what forms should it

take?

(4) What safeguards against abuse are required?

(5) What, if any, are our legitimate and necessary intelligence

needs?

chan then man

(6) How much change, restructuring, and/or elimination of

organizations are required to meet on the one hand the "legiti-

mate" intelligence needs of our Nation, and on the other hand

level of our already limited resources do we perceive as necessary

to meet our intelligence needs?

These and other questions must be discussed and debated within an

atmosphere of reason. To resolve these questions and reach some con-

sensus, it will demand the best within each of us as representatives of

the people. The issues both implicitly and explicitly raised by the

committee recommendations are of extreme importance and must be

addressed within that context.

I oppose the committee's recommendation regarding: (A) A House

Committee on Intelligence, insofar as,

The committee shall have

exclusive jurisdiction

for all covert action operations." I believe

that this information should be more widely shared. Discerning over-

sight is facilitated by involving several relevant committees, and I

think jurisdiction over covert action operations should be shared with

those committees presently involved.

I am opposed to that part of the recommendation regarding: (B)

Release of information (4) 61he celect committee recommends that

the rules of the House be revised to provide that any member who

reveals any classified information which jeopardizes the national se-

curity of the United States may be censored or expelled by a two-

thirds vote of the House."

"National security" is now an infamous

chilling system which allows demagogues the easy opportunity of

injuring a member by making reckless charges.

The committee's recommendation on covert action is not satisfac-

tory. The committee recommendations say,

"1. The select committee

recommends that all activities involving direct or indirect attempts to

assassinate any individual and all paramilitary activities shall be pro-

hibited except in time of war."

We should prohibit all covert action.

Ve live in a world becoming increasingly smaller and interde

endent. a world. in which secrecy and cloak and dagger methods. ir

ny estimation, are anachronisms from the past. They should have no

place today in the world tre will continue to live in.

proval. I have proposed that a standing committee be informed of

covert operations before they

are approved by the President. The

standing committee or committees should not have veto power, but

the committees, or their members individually, should have the oppor-

tunity to make their views known to the President.

No doubt a number of members would simply write out a list of

reservations to cover themselves in case an operation went wrong. But

is that bad? It is a good idea to have advice reaching the 'resident

from a few people who have a bias for negativism. There is too much

me-tooism in the executive branch already.

Furthermore, if the members of the new 40 Committee knew that

Congress was part of the consultative process, they would be likely to

move with greater care and discretion than has been true in the past.

Prior notification of Congress is one more governor on the intelligence

vehicle which could inhibit the kind of reckless driving the committee

uncovered in its investigations.

The committee, in a number of its recommendations, has sought to

provide a tramework for improvement. But we have left the CIA

high and dry organizationally. I believe that the ClA should be di-

vided into two separate agencies one devoted only to analysis and

aroused is bound to discourage many good people from applying.

Furthermore, the analysts need interchanges with academia, and these

ties have been strained by the public perceptions that anyone con-

nected with the CIA has blood on his hands.

Ne have also seen, as in the Bay of Pigs, that proximity breeds bias

One side of the CIA planned the Bay of Pigs. The other side of the

CIA was not in a position to analyze it independently and critically.

Critics say it is impossible to separate covert collection from covert

perations, that many of the same people are used for the two pur

loses. This is quite true. However. my proposal leaves covert collec

tion and covert operations in the same organization and simply splits

them off from the analytical function.

No improvements will result if proposals for reform are consigned

to the archives like the report of this committee. Our intelligence serv-

ices have been ignored by Congress in the past-and we have seen the

consequences of that inattention. Congress now has a second chance to

decide if it wishes to play Pontius Pilate and wash its hands of an

unpleasant business or confront the issue headon. I hope the Congress

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF HON. RONALD V. DELLUMS

I supported the committee majority in bringing to the House of

Representatives those recommendations finally adopted by the com

mittee.

However, this should not indicate my approval of all the

adopted recommendations; several are not strong enough and severa

idditional recommendations should have been adoptec

Recommendation No. 11: Infiltration of Groups or Associations

I recommend that judicial warrant must issue, on probable cause,

before an informant or any other agent of the FBI may infiltrate any

domestic group or association, when (1) investigation of such

or association or its members is based solely on title 18 U.S. roug

2383, 2384, 2385, and (2) there is no credible evidence that such group

or association, or any person connected therewith has encouraged, ad

vocated or suggested the use of violence, terrorists activities or other

unlawful activity.

Recommendation No. 1%: Study of Intelligence Operations of Foreign

Nations

I recommend that the Joint Congressional Committee on Intelli-

gence (or, in the absence of the creation of such a committee, the ap-

propriate

congressional committee

or committees) promptly com

nence a detalled investigation and study of the intelligence opera

tions of foreign nations, including, but not limited to the intelligence

operations of the U.S.S.R. and the Peoples Republic of China, which

investigation and inquiry shall include, but not be limited to, the

following:

(a) The means by which intelligence is gathered relating to activi

ties of the United States and its allies, both within and outside of the

United States.

(b) The extent of valuable and/or critical intelligence information

gathered by foreign nations from publicly available journals and

documents.

(°) The methods employed by and the extent of success of foreign

nations in the rècruitment of American or allied nationals in espio-

nage activities, and the methods employed by and the extent of success

of foreign nations in infiltrating the U.S. Government or U.S. organi-

zations, corporations, associations and groups.

ALTORNATIVE RECONIVENDATIONS OF HON. ROBERT W. KASTEN, JR.

INTRODUCTION

Although I wholeheartedly support many of the recommendations

proposed by the committee's majority, the majority proposals collec-

tively do not accurately refect my judgments concerning the reform.

and improvements which should

be made in the U.S. intelligence

To indicate specific points of agreement and disagreement, I have

reproduced below the majority recommendations together with my

own alternative or additional proposals. Language in the majority

report with which I disagree has been stricken out; my alternative

or additional language has been underscored.* In several instances, I

have also added brief comments in brackets following the recom-

mendation to which the comments refer.

A. A HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

1. The select committee recommends that there be formed a [stand-

ing] Joint Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.

and the Senate.

* GPO style, set in italie type.

a. The committee membership should reflect a broad representation

of political and philosophical views.

b. The committee should consist of not more than 13 or less than

nine members, designated by the President pro tem of the Senate and

the Speaker of the House in consultation with the minority leader of

each House. The majority shall have one more than one-half of the

members appointed from either Elouse.

c. No Member of the committee may serve more than 3 consecutive

terms on the committee, and no member of the staff may serve more

than 6 years.

d. Any past or current member of the committee staff who shall re-

lease, without authorization of the committee, materials or information

obtained by the committee shall be immediately terminated from em-

ployment and shaul be fully subject to criminal and civil action, not-

ivithstanding legislative immunity.

e. The committee shall be vested with subpoena power and shall

have the right to enforce by a proceeding for civil contempt its sub-

poenas in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or any

other court of competent jurisdiction, [without authorization] if au-

thomsed i from the touse, provided the committee has so designated

by resolution. The committee staft shall be given statutory standing to

represent the committee in any proceeding arising from the issuance

ot a subpoena.

f. The committee's jurisdiction shall include all legislative and over-

sight functions relating to all U.S. agencies and departments engaged

in foreign or domestic intelligence. The committee shall have exclu-

sive jurisdiction for budget authorization for all intelligence activities

and exclusive jurisdiction for all covert action operations. All remain-

ino oversight functions may be concurrent with other committees.

Note: 1 am opposed to the creation of two oversight committees on

intelligence: one in the House and one in the Senate. I favor instead

the creation of a joint committee because it will reduce the burden on

the DCI and intelligence officials of repeating testimony before com-

mittees with similar jurisdiction and also reduce the burden of Con-

gress by having many members assigned to tasks which are duplicative.

In addition, concentration of oversight in one joint committee would

reduce the possibility of unauthorized disclosure of information and

more importantly would help assure that problems would not "fall

between to chairs" and be addressed by neither committee. The fact

that each appropriations committee in reviewing the budget of the

intelligence-gathering agencies would have an oversight function re-

duces the possibility that one joint committee would be co-opted by

the intelligency agency.]

B. RELEASE OF INFORMATION

1. The select committee recommends that rule XI.2 (e) (2) of the

House Rules is amended to read as follows:

"Each committee shall keep a complete record of all committee ac-

tion which shall include a copy of all reports, statements, and testi-

mony of witnesses whether received in open or in erécutive session."

; 1?. The Committee shall have the right to release any information or

documents in its possession or control by a vote of a majority of the

I. DOMESTIC

1. The select committee recommends that judicial warrant

must

issue, on probable cause, before an informant or any other agent of the

2. The select committee recommends that the Director of the t'bl

have a term of office no longer than 2 presidential terms.

3.

The select committee recommends that the Internal Security

Branch of the Intelligence Division be abolished and that the counter-

intelligence branch be reorganized to constitute a full division named

the Counter-Intelligence Division; that the mission of this Division

be limited to investigating and countering the efforts of foreign di-

rected groups and individuals against the United States.

4. The select committee recommends the transfer of all investiga-

tions of alleged criminal activity by domestic groups or individual

members thereof to the General Investigative Division.

5. The select committee recommends that regulations be promul-

rated that tie the investigation of activities of terrorist groups closely

o specific violations of criminal law within the investigative juris

diction of the FBI and that charge the Department of Justice with

determining when a domestic political action group may be appropri-

ately targeted for investigation of terrorist activities.

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF HON. LES ASPIN

All the hearings, all the hassles and all the headlines should have

underscored the fact that the Select Committee really faced three

challenges:

how to banish abuses from the intelligence system;

how to control covert operations; and

how to improve the intelligence product, the analyses for which

we spend so much money.

The committee has approved a number of recommendations which

2o to the heart of these problems

The establishment of an Independent Inspector General for Intelli

gence will provide an office designed exclusively to hawkeye the in-

telligence community and see that it is adhering to the law.

The institutionalization of a successor to the 40 Committee will pro-

vide systematic direction of covert operations by the executive branch

for the first time.

And creation of a more powerful director of central intelligence will

for the first time give one man the authority to whip the many in-

telligence fiefdoms into line and eliminate the duplication and waste

that the committee found to be rife.

I think that there is more that we could have done and I have two

additional proposals.

The select committee suggested that a standing committee be in-

formed of an approved covert operation within 48 hours after its ap-

he may choose or the committees may direct.

[T. DOMESTIC]

[1. The Select Committee recommends that judicial warrant must

issue, on probable cause, before an informant or any other agent of

the FBI may infiltrate any domestic group or association,

restigation of such group or association or its members is based solel

on title 18 U.S.C. & 2383. 2384. 2385

[2. The select committee recommends that the Director of the FBI

have a term of office no longer than 2 presidential terms.

members thereof to the General Investigative Division.

Г5. The select committee recommends that regulations be promul-

gated that the the investigation of activities of terrorist groups closely

to specific violations of criminal law within the investigative juris-

diction of the FBI and that charge the Department of Justice with

determining when a domestic political action group may be appropri-

ately targeted for investigation of terrorist activities.]

CONCLUSION

As these recommendations indicate, my service on the select commit-

gence officials can and must operate in a manner consistent with th

individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. Thes

protections must be guaranteed,

people to live in security and peace. It is both possible and essential

for the intelligence agencies to perform their responsibilities effec-

tively, and by means which protect both individual rights and national

At a minimum, the intelligence community must regain the trust

and confidence of the people whom it serves. It is tragic that it was

necessary to establish this committee to inquire into the activities of

agencies on which we depend so heavily for our security. But it would

be even more tragic if the results of our investigation were now to be

ignored, Implementing the recommendations I have proposed will

ontribute significantly to ensuring that there will be no need fo

nother such committee to be established in the future. Both Congres

and the American people must recognize the need to complete the task

which we have only begun.

62-116464

DETAILS:

On 2/11/76, Captain John Matheny, supra,

telephonically advised Senstudy 75 Project that on that

supt on that

date a hasty agreement had been reached between the

executive branch and HSC concerning the interim disposition

of the HSC's documents.

Captain Matheny stated the agreement

was reached in gegotiations between CIA and Representative

Otis G. Pike, Chairman of the HSC, and HSC Staff. Captain

Matheny stated the details of this agreement, other than

the fact documents would be going to CIA under seal, were

as yet unclear; however, he would immediately advise when

same were : known.

On the p.m. of 2/12/76, Captain Matheny tele-

phonically advised Senstudy 75 Project details of the

agreement were as follows:

(1) All documents furnished to the HSC by

executive branch departments or agencies on an "on loan"

basis would be returned to the originating department or

agency.

(2) All items or materials received from the

National

Security Council would be returned thereto.

(3) All transcripts of hearings, public and

executive, and interviews conducted by the HSC and all

materials received unsolicited or otherwise generated by

the HSC would be placed in safekeeping with the National

Archives.

opened or their contents examined except on further author-

ization from the House of Representatives or the Speaker

of the House.

Captain Matheny stated it had been decided that

the material going to CIA under seal would be first segregated

as to originating department or agency and thereafter placed

in separate cartons, sealed and the originator identified

thereon.

He further stated that Mr. Antonin Scalia,

Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Department

of Justice, had agreed to the above arrangements on behalf

of the Department of Justice and its agencies.

He advised that Bureau representatives should be

present beginning on 2/13/76 in order to oversee the

segregation of documents and to account for and seal material

provided by the Bureau.

On 2/13/76, and again on 2/17 and 2/20/76, Special

Agents Andrew J. Duffin and Sammy J. Miller of the Senstudy 75

Project were physically present at the HSC offices, along

with representatives of several other departments and

agencies.

It is noted the HSC's resolution had expired as

of 1/31/76 and present on behalf of the HSC during this

particular period were only Ms. Jacqueline Hess, HSC Security

Officer, several unidentified HSC Staff Members involved in

extraneous and personal matters not connected with this

project, and a uniformed guard.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Houstudy 75

Disposition of House

Select Committee (HSC) Records

62-116464

It was stated by Ms. Hess that there was some

urgency involved with the segregation and transportation

of the HSC documents to CIA as the physical protection

being provided to the HSC premises by the security guard

would

cease as of 2/20/76.

It should be noted it was immediately obvious

that chaotic conditions had existed at the HSC, particularly

evident in the complete disarray of their records and

materials. All materials, irrespective of originating

department or agency, were haphazardly commingled and

the elementary records management system attempted by

the HSC, by Ms. Hess' admission, had failed. She stated

HSC Staff Members, in their haste to depart, had returned

documents which had been in their personal possession

en massé, including numerous reproductive copies of various

and sundry documents, as well as personal notes, memoranda

and memorabilia.

At the outset, it was determined the material

furnished by the FBI was accounted for by the HSC upon

receipt only by filing the FBI transmittal IHM adjacent

to a copy of the pertinent HSC request letter in a loose-leaf

binder.

(This binder is sealed in carton at CIA marked

"HSC Transmittal Books.") Ms. Hess stated that this was

not done in every instance and, in fact, particularly 1I

the FBI IHM contained pertinent information, it more often

than not was furnished directly to the HSC Staff Member

who had initiated the request. In cases such as this,

the LHM may or may not have ultimately been incorporated

in her notebook.

Memorandum to Mr. I. W. Leavitt

Re:

Houstudy 15

Disposition of House Select

Committee (HSC) Records

62-116464

Initially, Ms. Hess had extracted some portions

of the FBI material and had it ready for inventory.

Thereafter, in her search through various filing cabinet

drawers, she would come upon different batches of material

and would make these available.

For the most part, these

included not only material originating with the FBI but

from various other departments and agencies. Due to the

enormity of the task, the constraints of time and the

existing working conditions, it was impossible to 1og in

or itemize each and every FBI document on hand. Therefore,

the inventory undertaken was in the form of accounting

for each FBI response made to HSC requests by locating

each particular responsive IHM and matching it with its

enclosures, if any. In the absence of the IHM, documents,

which were obviously enclosures, were generically described

and at a later date, through Senstudy 75 Project records

available at FBIHQ, identified with specific HSC requests

and FBI responses, and thereby accounted for.

FBI material inventoried and sealed amounted to

approximately 6 ½ cardboard cartons which were sealed with

Scotch-brand filament tape and identified on the ends

with the markings "HSC/FBI" followed by an arabic number

for the carton. It is noted that box number 7, in addition

to FBI materials, also contains materials from

State, DEA,

Civil Service, OMB, Treasury/ IRS

and IC. This was done

to limit the number of boxes involved as none of the above

had sufficient material to fill an additional box.

As FBI material was accounted for and sealed,

a Xerox copy of the generic inventory maintained was

provided to Ms. Hess as well as to Ms. Libby Moran, CIA

Review Staff Representative, who was overseeing this entire

Re:

matter for CIA. At a subsequent time at FBIHQ, this

generic inventory was reconciled with Senstudy 75 Project

Unit records and an additional inventory was compiled

setting forth in date order HSC requests, noting date of

fBI response, as well as the box number location of the

material involved. Upon completion of this detailed

reconciliation, it was determined that 13 original FBI

IHMs which were sent to the HSC in response to requests,

1l of which had no enclosures, are unaccounted for and,

at this point, they are presumed, by Ms. Hess, destroyed.

(The enclosures transmitted with

the -twor were accounted

for.) This presumption is made because Ms. Hess reiterated

many times that IHMs which contained information of

interest to the HSC were often not logged by her and

were forwarded directly to interested HSC Staff Members.

She noted that, during the waning days of the Committee,

much material the Staff Members considered expendable was

destroyed by shredding. Specifically, concerning FBI IHMS,

she stated it was the HSC's position that they, if they

transmitted enclosures, were nothing more than

• letters

of transmittal requiring no accountability. If they

contained information without enclosures, they were

considered to be Committee, not FBI, property and could

be disposed of at the Committee's pleasure.

In addition, it was determined that two LiMs,

both with enclosures, were unaccounted for and their

disposition is unknown.

By way of description, these

documents concern: (1) FBI 9/14/75 response to an 8/19/75

request which transmitted to the HSC four generic lists

regarding tax reports filed by the FBI with the IRS

setting forth deductions made from informant payments

covering calendar years 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. These

lists do not identify informants and only set forth amount

of taxes withheld; and (2) FBI 11/11//5 response to a

9/30/75 request which transmitted numerous documents setting

forth the various criteria which have been utilized to

include an individual's name on the ADEX, a chart portraying

a statistical breakdown of the ADEX, authority for

maintaining the ADEX and documents pertaining to its

predecessor, the Security Index.

With the above exceptions, all other FBI responses

were accounted for, it being emphasized again, that not

each and every document was logged. Further,

there is no

way of accounting for the multiple copies of documents

reproduced by the HSC Staff from those made available by

the Bureau, other than to the extent that extra copies

located during the above inventory were personally shredded

by Bureau personnel.

The original generic inventory, as well as the

detailed reconciliation, is being maintained with the

Senstudy 75 Project files.

There is attached a 2/27/76 CIA memorandum for

executive branch departments and agencies in which CIA,

as custodian of the documents, asks interested parties to

advise Captain John Matheny, Office of the Assistant to

the President for National Security Affairs, whether any

documents are missing. Captain Matheny will prepare and

maintain a consolidated list of executive branch documents

which are reported as missing should same be needed for

a future investigation.

destroyed are included in the letter as missing Bureau

documents because their true disposition is, in fact,

25 February. 1976

The Honorable Otis Pike, Chairman

Select Cormittee on Intelligence

House of Representatives

Washington, D. C.. 20515

Dear Chairman Pike:

I hereby acknowledge and accept the terns set forth in your

letter of February 20 for safekeeping of the three categories of

sensitive classified documents Furnished to or generated by the

House Select Committee on Intelligence.

As to the first category, pursuant to your letter, the "on

loan" material which was loaned to the Select Comittee by the

Executive branch has been received by the CIA and such material

has been returned to the originating departments and agencies.

With regard to the second category of materials, the trans-

cripts of testimony taken from surrent and former Federal officials

in executive sessions of the Select Connittee, it is my understanding

that these documents will be placed in the National Archives building

for safekeeping in the custody of the Archivist of the United States,

and that no one is to be given access to these materials pending

further instructions from the House of Representatives or Speaker of

the House. As you indicated in your letter of February 20 to the

Archivist, highly sensitive classified information is contained in

these transcripts, and they should be treated accordingly by the

Archivist. I am also concerned about any future plans for the dis-

position of these transcripts.

This material includes intornation

Involving sensitive sources and methods which I am charged by law

to proteci from unauthorized disclosure.. I would, therefore,

appreciate it if you would bring this concern to the attention of

the Speaker of the House and request that I be involved in any

decision regarding the future disposition of this material.

Finally, with respect to the third category of materials re-

ceived by the CIA from the Select Committee for storage at CIA

Headquarters, we have attempted to reconcile our records of documents

delivered to the Select Conmittee with the inventory of documents

i does tuater as tra stent to a number

Headquarters For storage were initially inventoried and sealed in

cartons by Executive branch representatives on the premises of the

Select Conmittee in the presence of Committee staff members during

the period of February 18-20.

Because a number of documents were

unaccounted for, it was agreed with your staff representative that

certain cartons should be inventoried again to determine whether

the missing documents might be in those cartons. Thus, a thorough

second inventory of certain sealed cartons was conducted at CIA on

February 21 with your concurrence and in the presence of Ns. Jacqueline

Hess of the Select Conmittee staff. While a few of the missing

documents were found in the second inventory, a number of documents

are still nissing.

As soon as a complete list of the missing materials is pre-

pared, my representatives will seek an early meeting with you to

determine that measures can be taken to account for or locate the

missing documents. Other Federal agencies are also checking their

records and inventories to determine whether any of their documents.

are missing.

The foregoing pertains only to the missing materials as we

have no way of accounting for the multiple copies of classified

documents reproduced by the Select Committee staff from originals

made available by the CIA and other Executive departments and

agencies. To the extent that the multiple copies have not been

'included in the materials to be stored at CIA or the National

Archives, I trust that those documents have been destroyed in ac-

cordance with procedures appropriate for classified materials.

The following is a summary of the third category of material:

now held in sealed cartons at CIA Headquarters pending further in-

structions from the House of Representatives or the Speaker of the

House:

This is to set forth our suggested response to a request

by the Criminal Division of the Department for detailed information

relating to classified FBI information disclosed by 'The Village Voice"

in its 2/16/76 supplement which incorporated portions of the House

Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC) suppressed report.

By memorandum dated 2/13/76, Assistant Attorney

General Fichard L. Thornburg, Criminal Division, made reference

to the publication by "The Village Voice" of the HSC suppressed

report. Thornburg, in his memorandum, requested this Bureau solicit

other agencies and to furnish information relating to FBI classified

material that was disclosed in 'The Village Voice." He indicated

this inquiry was necessary to determine if any action by the Depart-

ment of Justice is necessary,

Memorandum from Vir. Cassidy to Vir. Wannall dated

1/21/76, captioned "Houstudy," advised that appropriate components

of FBIHQ had been solicited and only one instance was determined

where classified material appeared in the Draft Final Report of the

HSC. This occurred in the identification of three of our foreign

counterintelligence programs by title, it being noted the names of

these programs had been classified "Secret" by the Attorney General.

Hon. Frank Church

U.S. Senate

Washington, L.C.

Dear Sen. Church:

By way of bockground, I served honorably with both the federal Bureay ai Invest-

igation and the Central

Intelligence Agency for a combined total of over 3;

years. I am proud of my

service with each agency and I feel that my activities

were quite worthwhile and in the national interest. I am s

graduate of George

washington University law School and a member of the bar. I am now retired.

interested and intellectually curious citizen, I have been reading

in the public press concerning the activities of the committee which

you happen to chair and

of the House Committee which Kep. Otis Pike happens to

chair, both dealing with the U.S, investigative and intelligence programs.brief-

ly stated, I am totally nauseated by the irresponsible way in which both

demand highly sensitive and classified date which seems to be publicized soon

after you get it.

It is my opinion and thit of many friends thot your committees

are effectively destroying the credibility of these agencies and making impos-

sible their effective performance in the future.

Before going

further, let me state that 1 do not condone irregularities,

or illegalities by either agency in

their normal, routine activities

out I do see the justification, in serious security or Mafia like criminal acti-

vities, for certain "extracurricular" activities to achieve needed ends and I

think that the Congress shoula quietly recognize such, with reasonable controls.

You should be proud

and complimentary, for instance in

my opinion, about the

highly publicized and often misrepresented mail intercept program when you

stop to realize that it wos confinec to mail to and from Russia and, insofar as

I read, the results were given appropriate safeguards.

I have no objection to having some type of scrutiny and supervision of these

agencies by some well qualified and impartial panel and I do not object to

hoving appropriate administrative action taken

against offending employees and

officials, if their rights are protected. What I do strongly object to is the

pathetically inept and horrendously damaging procedures whereby your inguires

on sensitive matters are regularly reported, sometimes incompletely and for

apparent political reasons. It just seems to me that someone connected with your

committees is afflicted with political "diarrhea of the mouth" which impels.

them to babble without regard to common sense or the welfare of our intelligence

programs and, as I read the press, you two gentlemen both have this weakness.

I am sure that the intelligence organizations of all major nations make some

mistakes. But have you

ever seen the British, the Frerich, the Hussians, the

Germans, the Israeli or the Japanese governments conduct such a "three ring

circus" on sensitive matters as you men are doing to your everlasting discrecit?

I am sure also that we are the laughing stock of all the above enumerated

nations. What foreign official will entrust sensitive and confidential data to

Uos, intelligence agents in the foreseeable future when he knows that he may soor

see his data publicized because of some misguided Congressional activity? 1 very

sincerely feel that strong administrative and or criminal action should be taken

cases where either or both of your committees and/or their personnel have

the vehicle for

embarrassing

or damaging the U.S. by actions which resulted

in confidential data being reported.

In order that there be no misunderstanding, this letter represents nothing

more than my

very sincere conviction of great personal contempt and dispust with

the way in which you and your committees have done

a great disservice to the

United States by sadly mishandling your responsibilities to these agencies and

to our nation.

Sincerely,

cC :

Putting Reins On The FBI

Disagreement among House subcommittee

members over guidelines proposed for domestic

| intelligence activities of the FBI underscores the

challenge legislators face in making rules that

, meet all free society demands without so handi-

capping the bureau that it cannot effectively do

the job expected of it.

On the one hand are congressmen like Rep.

Badillo of New York, who argues for tougher

guidelines than those suggested. They would pro-

I hibit instigation or commission by the FBI of

criminal acts, prohibit incitement of violence,

ánd the dissemination of information to discredit

individuals or groups. On the other hand are

congressmen like Rep. Edwards of California,

who thinks Atty. Gen. Levi has done a good job

• drafting the guidelines.

\ In the middle of the picture is FBI Director !

Clarence Kelley, who appeared before the sub-

" committee. to warn of the dangers of overly

I restrictive guidelines. Box the FBI in too much,

Mr. Kelley was saying in effect, and it will lose its

capability to handle such threats to the public

safety as those posed by terrorist groups.

Reaction to disclosures of such domestic sur-

veillance programs as Cointelpro has tilted opin-

ion in the direction of demands for assurance of

greater protection of individual rights and liber-

ties. And, indeed, those rights must be guaran-

, teed. In the matter of curbs on FBI activities,

however, the familiar pattern of response and

over-response is showing. The need is to strike

• a neat balance.

Stop intelligence

purge; it is fatal

THE CURRENT CONGRES-

SIONAL investigations into

United States intelligence op-

erations are an excellent ex-

ample of how far this nation

has strayed from its underly-

ing responsibilities.

We are genuinely delighted

that Congress at last is trying

to regain some of the balance

and authority granted it in the

Constitution, but really isn't it

time the American people,

themselves regained control of

the entire governmental pro-

cess, including Legislative,t

• Administrative and Judicial

branches?

Many times lately we can-

* I believe that the folks in Wash-

ington have so isolated them-

selves from the realities of

our lives - and those of the

international community -

that we can never fully regain

historic foundations of repre-

sentative government provid-

ed wisely by our forefathers

200 years ago.

It is all the more tragic that

in this Bicentennial year, the

heart of federal government

has so deteriorated as today to

represent the largest and

most ominous single threat to

human rights and freedoms

outside the covetous totalitari-

anism from without.

We certainly would not ad-

vise extreme pessimism as to

the future.

However, we would sharply

warn that most of the trends

of not only federal but state

and in some instances local

governments these days are

approaching an irreversible

E point from which recovery

will be impossible.

As said above,

the most

tragicomedic aspect of this

has to be the great federal

cunning of a power-crazed dic-

tator. '"

It is the awful uncertainty of

the 1960s when severest revo-

lutionaries, ideologies hostile

to America, well meaning

though unrealistic peacenik

movements, became almost

unextricably jumbled and de

•bilitating except for smooth

underground action by agen-

cies charged with the respon-

sibility to protect our nation.

It is the beginning of World'

mediately rounding up Ger-

man spies and saboteurs, a

feat unparalleled in modern

times and which would have

been impossible without secre-

cy, plus extraordinary extra-

legal surveillance and force

beforehand.

The necessity for keeping

governmental covenants in

such extreme situations is

fairly obvious.

Not so obvious apparently to

many in these seemingly less

perilous times is the necessity

ever to keep at least similar

vigils both at home and

abroad lest this type of nation-

al and international erosion is

allowed to occur again - as it

surely will under current

Due to the fact that this matter is being handled in Records Section

through normal mail processing procedures, it is most difficult to determine

which specific individual(s) may have typed a certain card or abstract, searched

a particular name, reviewed a particular file, etc. Therefore, names of

individuals have not been given. In some instances, a specific number of

individuals involved may be known and, where applicable, this has been shown.

But in some units it is impossible to know even how many persons performed

the work relative to a specific subject. All that can be given in some cases is

the estimated number of hours in a particular grade or level based on production

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mitchell Rogovin

SC/DCI

SUBJECT

:

Handling of HSC and SSC Investigative Materials

Representatives of the Department of State, 'Department of

Defense, Department of Justice, the National Security Council

Staff,

and the Central Intelligence Agency have considered al-

ternative ways for storing and handling the materials gathered

by the Senate and House Select Committees in their current study

of the intelligence activities of the government.

The key objectives were those of physically secure storage,

with proper controls over access to the materials, the uLtimate

decision on normal declassitication remaining with the depart-

ments, agencies or organizations that originated the materials.

Two main alternatives were developed for where the materials

should be stored. These were the National Security Agency (NSA)

and the National Archives and Records Service (Nio): the pre-

ference being for the former.

The Noc statt, in preferring storage

at NSA, specified additional handling provisions for Its materials.

Attached are alternative draft resolutions, providing for

storage at NSA or at NARS. Also attached is the NSC staff pro-

posal for modification of the proposal for storage at NSA, providing

for special handling there of NSC materials.

These are intended to

provide a basis for discussions with SSC and HSC personnel.

It is requested that this report be submitted to the ICG. It

is noted that time has become an essential consideration, in view

of the imminent conclusion of the HSC investigation.

Service (IRS) a coded list of Informants with tax deductions

withheld for each, along with a bank checi made out to IRs

for the total amount withheld. At no rime did this Bureau

file any individual tax returns for infosmants.

It should be noted that because IRS records are

now computerized, making it Impossible for IRS to provide

proper security for continuance of the above procedure, and

to effoct, for this lureau, a considerable monetary savinga

in clerical and Agent salaries required to maintain extensive

records in this regard, this Bureau, effective August 19, 1975,

discontinued the practice of withholding tax deductione nada

from informant payments,

In response to request Number ½ above, there are

enclosed tax reports filed by this Bureau with the Irs

reflecting tax deductions nade from informant payments

covering the calendar years 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. A

Those documents pertaining to the SI to which access

was requested are available for review by appropriately

In this

regard, it is to he noted that authority for maintaining the

SI stenmed from the Attorney General in connection with the

Departmental portfolio entitled "Program for Apprehension and

Detention of Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to

the National Defense and Fublic Safety of the United States."

Detailed information and documents concerning what

steps were to be taken in evant of a national emergency are

sot forth in the abova-mentioned portfolio which, since that

, document originated with the Department of Justice, should

be obtained from that source.

As has previously been stated, the ADIX is reviewed

continuously and on & monthly basis is brought up to date

with names being

added and deleted.

The SI list was prepared

In the same manner and, as with the fomer SI, when a new

monthly ADEX list is preparad copies of the old list

are destroyed inasmuch as they are outdated and no longer

During the

initial period of establishing the

manner on the new ADEX, as cases were reviewed under our then

on Its own merits utilizing the then current criteria for ADEX

to determine wecher continued inclusion on the ADEX was

warranted.

Il not, the individual's name was deleted. As

previously indicated, during 1972 the ADEX was avaluated and

Included on the ADEX began to decline and thus the high nuber

As previously stated, we neither believe it

necessary nor desirable to release copies of the ADEX list

Any release of

Per Thomas D. J. Brooks and James Nolan of the CI-l Section,

the espionage section of the ADEX should be classified "Top

Edward P. Grigalus, Unit Chief, IS-2 Section, should

It had been

indicated to me that the purpose of this interview was to inquire into my

participation at poker games at the Blue Ridge Club sponsored by Joe Tait,

President of U. S. Recording Company.

Mr. Oliphant stated the purpose of the interview was as indicated above

and also asked if they could inquire into my knowledge and/or participation in

connection with the purchase of equipment from the U. S. Recording Company.

Upon inquiry, Mr. Oliphant was informed that I had participated in a

poker party at the Blue Ridge Club on two or three occasions but not on any

occasion within the last six or so years. He was also informed that Wir, Mohr

was present on these occasions and served as a collector for the fee for the cost

of lodging and food on the occasions I attended. He was informed that Mr. Fait

and Mr. Coercick were provably present; however, no business di any laind

was discussed, it being purely a social event with the primary purpose oi geting

away from shop and shop-talk. He was further advised on the occasions that I

was in attendance former Assistant Director Donald Parsons was the host member

of the Blue Ridge Club.

In response to an inquiry as to why I had not attended

in more recent years, he was informed that I did not do so aiter my youngest

son married and left home as I did not care to leave the Virs. alone for the

Interview of Associate Direetor Nicholas I. Callahan

by Timothy Oliphant and Richard Vermeire of the House

Committee on intelligence Concerning U. S. Recording

Company

Air. Tait had a summer place on the Delaware Coast in the area where I likewise

had one and on a few occasions he has ridden by to say hello but has not visited

oxicnsively nor was any business discussed during these visito.

Messrs, Olichant and Vermeiro inquired as to the origin of the

relationship with U. S, Eccording Company and at what level was the price for

tho equipment purchased from U. B. Recording determined to be satisfactory.

I informed them that my rocollection of the relationship with the U. S. Reeording

Company dated back to the late 30's or carly 40's and the procedure of purchasing

confidential types of equipment was an ongoing frocedure at the time I became in-

volved in the Administrative Division. I stated there was no fixed procedure for

ascertaining the precise price or any markup relative thereto inasmuch as the

nature of the items purchased was such that primary rellance was left to the

technicians of our Laboratory who had shopped the industry for the equipment

nceded and that any detailed discussion regarding price would normally go through

the procurement officer of the Administrative Division and the technicians in the

Laboratory to see that a reasonable price was being paid but not an exorbitant or

unreasonable price. It was pointed out that procurement procedures in effect

would require any questionable price to be taken up with higher authority either

in the Laboratory or the Administrative Division to adjudicate such a question and

to my recollection there had been no occasions when this had occurred,

Vir. Vermeire inquired as to Vir. Mohr's relationship with the Laboratory

in connection with his position as Assistant to the Director and I pointed out that

there were times when the Laboratory was one of the Divisions under his juris-

diction and i was sure that the organizational charts they had would seem to

indicate this.

They inquired if I was aware of the fact that the Blue Ridge Club had

sufiered a fire and I advised them I had read it in the newspaper. They advised

they first became aware of it on a newscast while on their way to visit the club.

Nir. Vermeire inquired as to whether there was any inquiry being made

into the Eureau's dealings with the U. &. Recording Company and he was informed

Director Kelley had instructed an inquiry to be rade into the matter right after

the testimony of Vir. Kaiser before the Committee for which they work. Upon

inquiry whether there was any information available as to developments to date

with regard to this matter, thoy were informed since this was an ongoing inquiry

it would be inappropriate at this time to discuss such with them. When asked

when the inquiry would be completed, they were informed it would be concluded

very soon as the Director was just as anxious as the Committee was to have the

tull picture with regard to this situation. During this discussion Vermeire

alluded as to the volume of the purchases made in 1971 walch information had

been previously furnished to the Committee and it was pointed out that these

purchases resulted from the break-in of our Resident Agency in Media,

Pennsyivania, and the use of U. 5. Hecording was two-foldi one, to preserve

the conidentiality of the type ot equipment being installed throughout the

country in our Resident Agencies and two, to obtain expedite delivery in con-

nection with such equipment.

I also advised Messrs. Oliphant and Vermeire that purchases other

than those of a confidential nature were made from U.S, Recording Company

of items on which he was the supplier under the GSA general supply schedule

and where purchases on a competitive bid basis were made by soliciting bids

for items of equipment under this latter procedure he being on the bidder's

mailing list along with other manufacturers and suppliers. I pointed out that

procurement of all equipment adheres to the Federal Frocurement Regulations

prescribed by the General Servicos Administration,

Reference is made to Departmental memorandum re-

ceived by Legal Counsel Division on January 13, 1976, from

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination, to Antonin Scalia, Assistant Attorney General,

Office of Legal Counset, captioned "HSC Request for Opinion

as to Legality of FBI Proprietaries. " The House Select

Committee informally requested that the Department give its

opinion whether the FBI's creation of corporations

proprietaries contravenes the prohibitions set out in

Title 31, United States Code, Section 869.

Attached is a letter dated January 23, 1976,

from Steven R. Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel fox

Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney

General, Department of Justice, to Mr. A. Searle Field,

Staff Director, Select Committee on Intelligence, United

of proprietaries by the FBI.:'

The Department's response

points out that the legislative history of the provisions of

Section 869 makes it clear that Congress was directing

it-

iself to the practice of incorporating agencies engaged

purpose of 9overnmental functions, and

that the corporate

proprietaries is not to perform a governmental

function but to carry on a commercial activity. Thus,

proprietaries are not established for the purpose of acting

as an agency or instrumentality of the United States within

the meaning of Section 869(a) .

The Department further con-

Itends that Section 869(b) applies solely to "wholly owned"

Government corporations, and that term is defined by enu-

meration in Title 31, United States Code, Section 846, ano

no FBI proprietaries

are infided in that enumeration 302

Re:

The legislative history of the Act heavily em-

phasizes budgetary control of Government corporations. When

the Act was being considered there were estimated to be about

100 separate Government corporations with thousands of

employees and controlling billions of dollars of Government

funds.

The corporations engaged in a variety of businesses,

including insurance and finance, as well as Government opera-

tions such as subsidies and flood control. With the increase

and importance of Government corporations, there was increased

recognition by both the legislative and executive branches

that some means be found to coordinate the financial programs

of the corporations with that of the Government as a whole.

FBI proprietaries are under the budgetary control

lof the FBI and do not present the fiscal or budgetary problems

envisioned

by the Act.

The FBI budget, in turn, is prepared

in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular

No. A-ll and is subject to extensive review and

approval by

the Department of Justice, the Office of Management and

Budget, the House Appropriations Subcommittee, and the

Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. Therefore, the intent

of the Act is

being carried out.

Section 869 prohibits creation of a corporation

"for purposes of acting as an

agency or instrumentality of

the United States Government."

A proprietary does not hold

Itself out to the public to be an agency of instrumentality

of the Government, and therefore not in conflict with the

statute. It is an investigative method used by the FBI in

investigating. violations of the laws of the United States.

IA proprietary is not a profit-oriented corporation.

every person, that the head of a department, in the distri-

He is limited in the exercise of

show statutory provision for everything he does.

No govern-

To attempt

imposed on the exercise of its powers, there are numberless

It is concluded that Title 31, United States Code,

Section 869, should not be interpreted as applying to FBI

proprietaries because it is manitest from the statutory

history that Congress never contemplated its use in this

-type of situation.

Staff. Director

Select Conmittee on Intelligence

S. House of Representatives

Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Mr. Field:

This responds to your letter of January 21, 1976 and

your prior informal inquiries concerning the application of

the Government Corporation Control Act, 31 U:S.C• $841

et seg:,

to the establishment and use of so-called proprietary.

corporations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

In

particular your informal. inquiries have directèd our atten-

•tion to 3I U.S.C: $869.

31 U.S.C. C. (a.) provides:

No corporation shall be created,

organized

os acquired on or aîter December 5, 1945, by

any officer or agency of the Federai Government

of by any. Goverment corporation for the purpose

of acting as an agency or instrumentality of the

United States, except by an Act of Congress or

pursuant to an act of Congress specifically au-

thorizing, such action.

The legislative history of this provision makes it

clear that Congress was directing itself to the practice,

as exemplified by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, of

incorporating agencies engaged overtly in govemmental

functions, such as disaster relief, providing loans for

economic recovery, facilitating war production and the

like.

The corporate purpose of proprietaries is not to

perform a governmental function but to carry on a commer-

corporations are not established

of the United States" within the meaning of $869(a). Any

other interpretation would make the quoted language mere

surplusage.

31 U.S.C. 5869(b) by its terms applies solely to:

"wholly owned government corporationis)

That term is

defined by enumeration in 31 U.S.C. $346 and no F.B.I.

proprietaries are included in that enumeration.

• Your letter of January 21 apparently raises a question

concerning the source of the F.B.I.'s authority to use

proprietary corporations.

The Attorney General. is au-

thorized and required to investigate and prosacute crimes

against the United States.

28 U.S.C. $533. The Attorney'

General has charged the F.B.I. with the responsibility,

inter alia, to "investigate violations of the laws of the

United States . .

28 C.F.R. S0.85. Similarly, all

recent appropriations for the F.B.I: have contained language

similar to that in the current act which appropriates funds

to the F.B.I. "[flor expenses necessary. for the detection

and prosecution of crines against the United States.

• . ."

Pub. L. 94-121 tit. II: 89 Stat. 611, 619. The use of

proprietaries

is-merely one of the many investigative

techniques used by the F.B.I. in the discharge of its re-

sponsibilities.

It has long been established that execu-

tive agencies

have reasonable latitude for accomplishing

their prescribed responsibilities and do not need specific

statutory authorization for each act done.

#so Raquast for Opinion as to Lopality of FBI

The House Select Committee has requested in-

formally that the Department give its opinion as to

whether the FBI's creation of corporations as pro-

prietaries contravenes the prohibitions set out in

31 U.S.C. 869.

Attached is a very rough draft of a

Report which addresses this question. (This draft

was written by a non-lawyer staff member of the ESC

who

asked that we not attribute it to him or the HSC).

We would appreciate your preparing an answer to

the HSC's question.

John Mintz, Assistant Director

of the FBI is fanillar with this matter and may be able

to provide additional useful information soncerning it.

at th

services. This issue was "what is your justification for

establishing a proprietary, normally a corporation, as a

front for carrying out an intelligence mission?"

The committee raised this question because section 869 of Title

31, U.S. Code (1970) states in part as follows:

1.=:

"(a) No corporation shall be created, organized

or acquired on or after December 6, 1945, by any

officer or agency of the federal Government or by

any Government corporation for

the purpos of acting

as an agency or instrumentality of the United

States, except by Act of congress specifically

authorizing such action.

"(b) No wholly owned Government corporation created

or any agency thereor, including corporations,

shall be invested in or employed by any such

corporation after that date except for the purposes

of liquidation.

The General Accounting Office in a letter to the Committee

Chairman dated December 10, 1975 (B-179296) which discussed

the applicability of section 859 to the authority for CIA

to establish proprietaries stated in reference to the

legislative history of the açt

stated "we have found no.....

indication in the legislative history that Congress considered

the formation of corporations fox clandestine purposes.",

While it is recognized that the puspose of proprietaries

Is to conceal the role of the government in clandestine

activities, the lack of legislative history concerning

formation of clandestine corporations must be accepted. Thus,

section 869 precludes the formation of proprietary corporations

except by Act of Congress.

As discussed in the following paragraphs, the Military

services disagreed strongly with the committee position in

this matter. As an example, the Army stated in essence

NW 55319 DocId: 32989711 Page 200

## Page 201

that the provisions of section 869 should not be applied to

coxporations established for intelligence purposes by the

Army because cover corporations do not, by their nature,

represent themselves as agents of the U.S. government and

do not engage in any business activity.

The Navy, with a somewhat different approach, stated that

proprietaries are established for the sole purpose.

of facilitating the collection of intelligence. The Navy

further stated that the purpose of establishing a proprietary is to

provide a shield of non-attribution and that it would be impossible

to act as a U.S. government representative without destroying

the cover of non-attribution.

The Air Force

justified the use of proprietaries by citing in-house

savice approvals and approvals by the CIA and the Defense

Intelligence Agency. The Air Force stated in part "Justification

existed in the need for cover for clandestine foreign intelligence

collection activities."

In sunmary, the military services have justified the use

of

proprietaries on a rather pragmatic basis which states in

essence proprietaries are approved in accordance with regula-

tions, cleared by other agencies in the intelligence community,

and could not exist for intelligence purposes if it were

known that the U.S. government had an interest in the

operation of the corporation.

On 1/28/76, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Captain John

Mathney, National Security Council Staff, White House, tele-

phonically contacted Supervisor R. H. Ross, INTD.

He advised

that the eight write-ups, which had been furnished to him on

1/26/76 had proved useful. He stated that the write-ups would

be used either by being furnished to the minority members of

the HSC or incorporated into a Presidential rebuttal of the

HSC's report. He advised that he and representatives from

Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency, and Defense

Intelligence Agency were at that time preparing an overall

statement concerning the HSC's Draft Final Report. He then

read

a paragraph of the statement prepared regarding that

aspect of the report which dealt with the FBI.

It generally

Idealt with the fact that the report tried to characterize the

FBI

as an inept investigative body and how the report used a

broad brush approach to discredit the FBI investigations.

The prepared statement labeled the report as fallacious in

that the Committee neither balanced nor tempered its reportre

even though it possessed information which showed that in

the vast majority of instances,

the FBI conducted legal,

proper, and closely supervised

investigations.

Captain Mathney also requested to know whether the

leight write-ups could be furnished to minority members of the

Committee (Representatives McClory, Kasten, Treen, and Milford).

Further, he invited the fBl to have a representative present

with himself and the other agency representatives mentioned

above who were at that time preparing the statement.

He was

advised that his two requests would require consideration by

Bureau officials, but that he would be promptly advised.

Assistant Director Wannall was apprised of the above

and Mr. Adams was contacted by him. It was determined that

the Bureau had no objection to the eight write-ups being fur-

nished to the minority members of the Committee and that the

Mr. Adams instructed that Assistant

had any objection to furnishing any of the write-ups to the

minority members or desired to have a Departmental representa-

tive attend the drafting session. Assistant Attorney General

Lee was telephonically contacted by Supervisor Ross,

deferred both questions to Mr. Michael Shaheen, Jr., Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination. Shaheen was contacted

and apprised of the Bureau's views and stated that it was

"entirely appropriate" for

Also he felt that there

was no need for a Departmental representative

to attend.

Captain Mathney was recontacted (3:15 p.m., 1/28/76)

conducted hearings on H. Res. 982. Appearing before the

Committee as witnesses were Chairman Otis G. Pike (N.Y.),

the House Select Committee on Intelligence, Robert McClory

(Illinois).

Ostensibly, the resolution sought to extend the

• life of the Select Committee until midnight, wednesday,

2/11/76, for the purpose of filing of a supplemental report.

Member John Young (Texas), prohibited the Select Committee

from releasing any report containing classified materials

unless the report is published with appropriate security

markings and distributed only to persons authorized to re-

ceive it or until the President authorized the declassifi-

cation of the classified contents. The Young amendment was

at let conten

accepted by the Rules Committee on a recorded vote of

nine to six while t. Res. goz was passed by voice vote, thus

clearing the resolution for consideration by the full House

on 1/29/76.

another individual appeared in the room, placed SA Campbell

under oath and immediately departed the room. SAs Danny O.

Coulson and James Stassinos, FBI Legal Counsel Division,

accompanied SA Campbell to the Rayburn Building but were not

present during the actual interview. Approximately one-half way

through the 25 minute interview Oliphant was joined by Richard S.

Vermeire, HSC Staff Lember. SA Campbell at no time was advised

of his legal rights. SA Campbell requested and was advised he

would receive a transcript containing the results of the interview.

At the outset SA Campbell was asked his name, address

and to explain his supervisory duties in connection with his position

as Unit Chief of the Engineering Unit. SA Campbell replied that he

was made a Unit Chief in May 1975 and his responsibilities included

providing technical assistance to FBI field offices in connection with

investigative matters.

SA Campbell rarely saw the purchase order but was telephonically

contacted to see if the morchandise had arrived indicating it was

then necessary to pay for the items. SA Campball in answer to

by Nir. Oliphant was that the mark up was 10-15 or 20 per cent

depending on the price of the items and the difficulty encountered

in obtaining the items.

In answer to questions by hir. Oliphant, SA Campbell

avisod he had met Mr. Tait of U. 1. Recording Comagny on

several occacions in conncction with his employment but did not

know him socially. SA Campbell stated he had heard of the Fargo

Company and had looked at onc of their catalogs but never ordered

anything from them. SA Campbell had heard of Gus Oberdick and

that he was a distributor of Smith & Wesson firearms.

Vermeire entered the room at approximatoly this time and

asked some of the previous questions. HSC Stati Members then

inquired concerning SA Campbell's relationship with Martin Kaiser.

JA Campbell stated he had ret Mr. Kaiser while he was visiting in

the Section. He was possibly visiting former sA John Matter, now

retired, and had met him several times since that time. SA Campbell

had purchased some small radio transmitters from Mr. Kaiser and

looked at somo of his car following equipment. Mr. Kaiser's equip-

ment was satisfactory for the price and in some instances iir. Faiser

knew the equipment was being purchased by the r'BI.

MSC Stait Members asked if SA Campbell Inew John Mohr.

SA Campbell furnished the following information concerning Nir. Mohr

in response to questione. Sa Campboll Inew Mr. Mohr as an FBI

official but did not lnow him socially. He did not hear any rumors

or gossip that indicated there was anything out of the ordinary between

Mir. Mohr and Mr. Tait. Even aiter information appeared in the

newspaper SA Campbell stated he would bo very surprised if anything

transpired botween them that was illegal. SA Campboll was at

Mir. Mohr's home to holp repair a TV set which he thought was good

security practice for FBI officials. SA Campbell nevor worked on or

hoard of any other FBI employees working on any vehicle owned by

Mr. Liohr. GA Campbell did not know if Mix. Mohr obtained anything

from Mr. Tait at a discount. AA Campuell was instructed to go to

Nir. Mohr's home by his suparvicor who at that time was Mir. Bradley,

Director Sec'y

Richard Vermeire, Staff Member of the House Select

Committee, on 1/27/76 advised that at 2:30 p.m. on that date

DAT

the House Select Committee was going to consider recommendations.

concerning corrective action or legislation necessary as, deter-

mined by the Committee's review of the FBI.

Vermeire said that

two of the recommendations troubled him--one being a recommendation

being made to the Committee by the Staff that warrants be necessary

for

the use of informants in the domestic intelligence area based

on a probable cause standard.

Vermeire indicated that both he and Timothy Oliphant

staff Member of captione Committee, were concerne asked/in the

proposal and considered it totally unworkable.

Bureau could furnish him orally some suggestions or arguments he

might use to convince the Committee that such a warrant require-

ment is not feasible. He was advised that a determination would

be made by the Bureau concerning this and that he would be re-

contacted.

Vermeire also indicated that they were concerned with

a recommendation for a new oversight committee being created to

review FBI operations. It was pointed out to Vermeire that the

Director had testified on oversight and while he was in favor of

the concept, the Bureau was desirous that oversight functions be

consolidated. In this regard, it was pointed out to Vermeire

that there were currently three Committees in the House claiming

oversight responsibilities pertaining to Bureau operations--Sub-

committee on Government Information and Individual Rights of the

House Committee on Government Operations, Subcommittee on Civil

and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciaryg"

and Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties/ and the Aâministration

of Justice of the House Committee on the Judictary!

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE: HOUSTUDY

Vermeire was very appreciative of the information

concerning oversight and asked that he be advised as soon as

possible of any arguments or suggestions the Bureau might have

concerning warrant requirements for informants in the domestic

intelligence area.

Contact was made with SA Thomas J. McNiff of the

Intelligence Division, SENSTUDY 75 Staff, and Steven Blackhurst,

Assistant Special Counsel on Intelligence Coordination in the

Department, regarding Vermeire's request and both agreed that it

would be advantageous to furnish suggested arguments concerning

warrant requirements for informants to the House Select Committee.

Attempts were made to telephonically contact Vermeire

on 1/27/76 to furnish him the requested information unsuccess-

fully and on 1/28/76, Vermeire telephonically contacted SA Paul V.

Daly of this Division. Vermeire was generally advised of the

problems presented by the requirement of warrants based on

probable cause for the utilization of information in the domestic

intelligence area. The arguments were as follows:

The problem in defining the information being

sought by the informant for the Bureau. It was pointed out

that these investigations are by nature difficult to describe

in scope and that a warrant requirement would seem to require

a specification as to what is being sought.

(2) The use of informants in this area is generally

at a very early stage in the investigation at which time it

would be unlikely there would be Misufficient information

available to meet a probable cause standard.

(3) If a court were to issue a warrant for the use

of an informant, what procedures would be necessary for the

court to monitor the use of the informant subsequent to their

approval?

(4) It would appear that such a legislative recom-

mendation would be casting the court in a role to which they

are unaccustomed and moving the courts closer and closer to the

very initiation of an investigation.

(5) What arrangements or considerations would have

to be made to protect the identity of an informant wherein a

(6) It was pointed out that there would be great

difficulty in drafting a concise or accurate definition of

domestic intelligence investigations.

Vermeire was very appreciative of the aforementioned

arguments and stated he would use these in an attempt to explain

to the Committee the difficulty presented by legislation in this

area.

As you are aware, on December 31, 1975, SA Royce

V. Colby, Radio Engineering Section, FBI Laboratory

appeared, as requested, at the offices of captioned

committee.

SA Colby was questioned under oath by staff

members Richard Vermiere and Tim Oliphant, and the testimony

was recorded by a court reporter.

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise and

make a matter of record an "incident" which happened in

connection with the above testimony. The room which was

to be used for the interview was being occupied by a staff

member using the telephone.

When staff member completed

his telephone conversation he departed leaving the room

available for Mr. Verdere, Oliphant and Colby.

Upon

entering the room following Mr. Oliphant SA Colby noticed

a crunched-up dollar bill lying on the floor just inside

the door of the interview room.

up and gave it to Mr. Oliphant who at the same time asked

dollar bit lying SA Colby picked the money

If Colby had dropped it.

Colby replied that he did not

think the money belonged to him since he normally did not

carry loose bills in his pocket. Oliphant then handed

the dollar to Mr. Vernierewho departed from the room to

RE :

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

"thet they, point the

court reporter entered the room followed by Mr. Vermiere

and Mr. Oliphant immediately commenced the interview.

No further reference to the dollar bill was made by any

of the staff members

including Mr. Vermiere who apparently

had returned the dollar bill to the departed staff member.

SA Colby feels since he had no opportunity to

pursue the statements made by Mr. Oliphant that it would

be difficult to establish whether Mr. Oliphant was

"joking" or whether this was in fact a "trick" to

establish the credibility of SA Colby's testimony.

however, it is telt that the details of this encounter

should be brought to the attention of the Bureau for

information in the event similar tactics are employed

by House Select Committee staff.

experience and current assignments in the Laboratory. The

questioning then turned immediately to procurement procedures

and specifically to the use of U. S. Recording Company as a

"cut-out" or confidential source for procurement purposes.

Questions were asked concerning the price mark-up applied by

U. S. Recording and whether SA Perritte had any knowledge of

improper conduct by Bureau personnel in connection with

purchases made fron U.S. Recording-

SA Perritte was also

asked whether he had any knowledge of purchases fron Gus

Oberdick or the Fargo Company:

SA Perritte was asked whether

he had any knowledge, or had

heard any runors concerning the

development of a "bottle cap" being developed by Laboratory

personnel and subsequently patented by lir. Tolson. SA Perritte

Washington, D. C., by Mr. Timothy Mliphant In the presence

of SA Paul Daly.

Mr. Mliphant, who is representing

SA Kirsch

advised that he had attended two such gatherings primarily

composed of bureau personnel (present and former) during

early 1974, the first such occasion being in January or

February and the second a few months later, probably April,

1974.

that SA Kirsch attended at the Invitation of Assistant to

the Director, Deputy Associate Director Thomas J. Jenkins

Who was at that time Assistant Director in charge of

for meals and lodging at Harper's Ferry and SA Kirsch

advised that at best he could recall the costs were not

excessive and probably $12 to $15 covered the entire affair.

Certainly no more than $20 was expended at either of the

two outings by SA Kirsch. SA Kirsch did not recall exactly

who collected for the meals but believes it was probably

MI. John Mohi.

Mr. nliphant asked what the table stakes

They inquired it Mr. Cochran felt a system of requiring Laboratory revier of

confidential procurement mark-ups would be desirable from the standpoint

of ensuring they were renconable and justified. Mi, Cochran stated the

Laboratory's position is that such mark-ups are not occasioned by technical.

considerations, but are based on an operational nced falling within the

procurement responsibility of the Administrative Division. In these

circunstances ve are paying for a sorvice - confidentiality. The fact

that past expericace with U. f. Recording Company has been highly

favorable in terms of fringe benetits - marranty servico, prompt

ropairs, procurement of scarce items, and the liko - are importni

factors, but not the main concern in determining zeasonableness of

any mark-up.

on Intelligence in the presence of Special Agent John Dennis Miller

of the FBI Legal Counsel Division. The stated purpose of the interview

was concerning Mr. Adams' attendance at a poker game at the Blue

Ridge Rod and Gun Club, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

Nir. Adams reported that at the invitation of former Assistant

to the Director John P. Mohr he attended one of the social gatherings

during the first half of 1974. He could not provide the exact date but

believed it was in the spring of 1974. The guests arrived Friday evening

and departed around Saturday noon. The expenses were shared by the

participants, Mr. Adams recalling that immediately upon arriving

rxiday evening he was met at the door by Mr. Mohr who advised

Mr. Adams that Mr. Adams' share of the expenses was $25. This amount

was paid in cash immediately upon arriving and was to cover the cost of

the dinner Iriday night, breakfast Saturday morning, a snack at Saturday

noon, and lodging.

There were a number of guests present including present and

former FBI employees and present and former Central Intelligence Agency

employees as well as other present or former Government employees. It

was strictly a social affair and no business was discussed.

Although such outings had taken place over a period of time,

this was the first and only attendance by Mir. Adams. It was Mr. Adams'

recollection that it was subsequent to attending that he learned that Joe

Wait was the member of the Blue Ridge Club through whose courtesy the

facilities of the Club were made available, with the attendees paying all

the expenses.

Mr. Tait was in attendance as was Gus Oberdick, neither

of whom was l present or former Government employee to Mir. Adams'

knowledge.

INTERVIEW OF ASSETANT TO THE DIRECTOR JAMES B. ADAMS

BY TIM OLIPHANT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTOE ON INTOLLIGENCE

CONCERNING U. S. RECORDING COMPANY

In response to questions, Mr. Adams advised that he did not

believe he had ever heard of the U. S. Rocording Company until recently,

nor was he specifically aware of Mr. Toit's employment with that Company.

He was aware that Mr. Oberdick represented Federal Laboratories and

believed he had been aware of such fact for several yoars. He believed

he had met Nir. Tait and Mr. Oberdick sometime after commencing his

assignmont to Mr. Mohr's offico as Inspector and Numbar One Man in

April, 1071. He recalled both had visited Mi. Mohi's office, he having

soen them in the reception room on a couple of occasions. It was pointed

out that Mr. Adams' office and desk at that time were located in such a

manner that he was unable to see visitors entering or leaving the recoption

room, located batween Mr. Mohr's office and Nir. Adams' office.

Mr. Adams outlined his assignments at FBI Headquarters and

pointed out that these assignments would not have involved him in

procurement matters, even while assigned to Mr. Mohr's oifice from

April, 1971, until July, 1972. There was a delineation of worl assign-

ments to facilitate the flow of mail wherchy Mr. Adams did not as a matter

of course review matters going in to Mr. Mohr from subordinate divisions

unless such matters fell within the purview of Mr. Adams' responsibilities.

Purchase matters and procurcent matters were not included among

Mr. Adams' responsibilities. Furthermore, when Mr. Mohr would be on

leave he would be relieved by one of the Assistant Directors under his

supervision, gencrally Mr. Callahan of the Administrative Division.

Accordingly, during the normal course of business Mr. Adams would have

had no occasion to see any matters partaining to U. S. Recording Company

and he has no recollection of ever having seen such or been aware of any

activities of that Company until just recently.

Vir. Adams was asked concerning recent publicity to the effect

that certain files might have been removed from Mr. Hoover's office and

taken up to the Bluc Ridge Club for burning and he advised that he had

absolutely no knowledge whatsoever concerning any such alleged activity.

He pointed out that a thorough inspection inquiry had been conducted with

statements being taken under oath from all pertinent parties without

developing any information that any oificial files had been removed from

Mr. Hoover's office and destroyed surreptitiously. Mr. Adamo expressed

the hope that the House Committee might see fit to subpoena the writer of

such articles and attempt to force him to reveal the source of tho allegations

in order that the matter might be further resolved.

CONCERNING U. S. RECORDING COLIPANY

I was interviewed by Tim Oliphant of the House Select Committee

on Intelligence on December 9, 1975. The purpose of the interview was

essentially to develop my attendance at the Blue Ridge Rod and Cun Club,

Milliscoro, Virginia. Mr. Oliphant briefly advised me how my name was

obtained by the Committee, stating that it appeared on a list of names

which John Mohr had identified as attendees at the Club for the purpose

of playing poker.

Mr. Oliphant asked me how many times I had been up to the Club.

I, indicated I wasn't quite sure but would estimate that it was ketween six

and eight occasiong, commencing approximately in 1970. Itold

Mr. Oliphant that the invitation was usually extended by Mir. Mohr and

each attendee was requested to share the cost. I told him that I paid $25

on each occasion except for the last one which was $30. This fee covered

room and board, and beverage i one desired, for friday night and

saturday morning. Fayment was made tirectly to Mr, Monr immediately

upon arrival.

Nix. Oliphant asked if I knew who the member of the Club was

and I rosponded that while I did not know on my initial attendance I did

subsequently learn that Mr. Joseph Tait was a Club member. He asked

if I was avare Mr. Tait was connected with the U. S. Recording Company

and I said I was not aware of this relationship until I xead it in the news-

Intelligence Concerning U. S. Recording Company

Mr. Oliphant queriod as to whether or not there were other

indivicuals who wore not current or former Burcau employces or

current or rotired Government employcas who attended the Club. I

told him the only individual I could think of off hand who would fit that

category was Joe Digenmann who I believed was with lietro.

Nir. Oliphant then told me it was his belief that Mir. Eigenmann was

connected with the Government. I was asked if any business was

conducted during these poker affairs and I told him I did not and could

not recall business being conducted. They were purely social atfairs.

Mr. Oliphant asked how long I had keen assigned to the

Adminictrative Division and I replied from Nay, 1961, until my desig

nation as iir. Jenkins' assistant in April, 1975. I told him thai the

major fortion of my career in the Adminisirative Division wes in the

Personnel Section and that it was not until my assignment as

Ms. Walsh's deputy in September, 1973, that I had any supervisory

responsibilities with respect to the other sections in the Administrative

Division. Mr. Oliphant asked for the dates of my assignment as

Mr. Walsh's deputy and iny check with the Fersonnel Section determined

the antes to be Sepiember 6, 1913, to April S, 1975. I esplained to

Nir. Oliphant that even though I participated in the overall management of

the Division, I. Walsh assumed principal responsibility of the

Procurement and Administrative Services Section. Mr. Oliphant asid

if I could recall approving any contracts involving U.S. Recording

Company and I advised I could not. I explained to him that I was not a

Contracting Officer and if I had approved the action of a Contracting

Officer I relied on the fact that the equipment requested was justified

and that we had sufficient funds to pay for same prior to the letting of the

bid os purchase of the cquipment.

Iis. Oliphant indicated to me that everyone he had tallied to to

dato had related substantially the same information concerning the poker

affairs. He was very cordial during the interview and thanked me for

the information furnished.

.. PIE ROLE OF PROPRIETARIES

IN CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

INTRODUCTION

Our investigation showed that intelligence

connected proprietaries have been established by the

Army, Navy and Air Force within the Department of

Defense and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Although the Department of State has an intelligence

gathering mission, the Department advised the com-

mittee that proprietaries had never been used as a

front in their intelligence gathering activities.

The proprietaries owned by the Military Services

and the FBI were established to provide a method of

gathering raw intelligence data or to support the

• clandestine activities of U.S. agents in such a man-

ner that any direct connection between the U.s.

government is hidden and would appear non-existent.

The FBI utilizes proprietaries in both the for-

eign counterintelligence and criminal fields. In

the former, proprietaries are operated for the purpose

of collecting raw foreign counterintelligence infor-

mation, training of personnel and testing of equip-

ment. In criminal matters, the FBI has, on occasion,

operated proprietaries for the purpose of collecting

•evidence to be utilized in the prosecution of indi-

viduals engaged in criminal activities falling within

the Bureau's jurisdiction. si

FBI proprietaries

are, in. the criminal investi-

gation field, essentially small operations with a

short life span.

Since their mission is to collect

evidence for the prosecution of individuals engaged

in criminal activities falling within the Burcau's

jurisdiction, the successful prosccution of the

criminal ends the need for the proprictary and the

project is liquidated. Proprietaries formed to

deal with counter-intelligence as it pertains to

foxeign nationals engaged in their country's

intelligence effort carried out in the United States

may or may not be a short range project. Counter-

intelligence information is exchanged with appro-

priate agencies in the intelligence community.

Our review of financial records covering FBI

proprietaries and conferences with FBI officials

disclosed that about $1.5 million has been spent

in capital

outleys and operating expenses since

their inception about six years ago, Proprietary

Is have used

employees numbering at various times from 5 to 15

employees.

ater undercover FBI agerts.

Operation of these proprietaries has involved

the 'purchasing, leasing and/or renting of real

property. In each'instance, safeguards to protect

the government's interest in the proprietary have

been reviewed within the Bureau and the Department

of Justice. Accounting controls of financial manage-

ment are handled by FBI internal auditors.

The FBI does not have specific regulations,

classified or unclassified, to cover the formation,

operation, or liquidation of a proprietary. We were

advised that safeguards to protect the governments

interest in each proprictary are revieved within the

Bureau

and by the Department of Justice.

oux discussions with FBI personnel, we believe spec-

ific safeguards on real and personal property held

by the proprietaries is similas to those employed

by the CIA and the military services, and not with

standing a lack of specific proprietary regulations

the safeguards are adequate.

Profits

The FBI's proprietaries do have in most instances

a legitimate source of income from commercial

sources.

However, the income is seldom sufficient

to offset operating expense and the necessary

infusion of funds is reflected on financial state-

ments in a variety of ways.

F'ederal, 'State, and local taxes, as reflected

in the financial statements examined, have been

paid, but are minimal, ave to operating expense.
