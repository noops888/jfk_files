However, both AMLASH and AM/HIP did not: want to becone involved with him

AMGHIP has been nost helpful and cooperat:ve in establishing
the initial contacts with AMLASH, and he undoubtedly does have such
influence over AXLASH. AMLASH also trusts ANNI? explicitly, as evidenced
by his renark to-ws that AMSHIP was the only one whom he felt that he
could fully trast and to whom he could speak openly. Of course, he did
speak openly at length to us at the behest of AMEIP, but it ts also.
obvious that he does not tell us everything. AMRIP-has given good advice
in the handling of AMLASH, tut, as he has a tendency to interpret AMLASH’s .
remarks and feelings subjectively, and to atterpt to zuide uz a bt too
mach, tt might te wise to eliminate in later portions of the talvs in Paris. -
With a Spanish-speaking C/o, thie should not he teo éiffveult to 4o, and
without alteaatin: AMSHIP: AMGHIP has no clandestine tia‘ning to speak of,

Literally at his word.
In dealing with AMLASH, one trait of his which confronts the c/o

at-every trun is his tenpernental resections over points which would

generally be considered minor. For example, at one tine when we were

discussing the various aspects of AMLASH's future role in Cuba, we used

the term “assassinate”. The use of this term, “e later learned from

AMAMIP and from AMLASH himself, was most objectionatle to the Latter, and
ha was visibly upset, It was not the act he objected to, but rather rarely

the choice of word used to desertte it. "Eliminate" was acceptable, but

obviously the term *assassinate” had % dlatasteful connotation. Fron
