bh. On 9 April 1965, James Wileott advised @ representative of EAB
that while visiting with members of an integration movement, he had come
in contact with an individual who professed to be a member of the Commnist
Party. Although the reasons for his contacts with these individuals are
not entirely clear, a review of Subject's statements reflects the follov-
ing: On 10 April 1965, James Wileott, hereafter referred to as Bubject,
vas in contact with one Ray Robinson Junior (NR-08 Indices), @ representa-
tive of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Comittee. Robinson asked
Subject to come to 1618 Corcoran Street, Washington, D. €. to meet a number
of integration movement people. According to Bubject's statements, when
he arrived at this address a Sroup of about eight people vere sitting around -
“drinking and smoking marijuana." Among these was one Alex Passikloff
(HR-08 Indices), a self-admitted Comunist. :

5. After various discussion vith members of the group, Subject agreed
to drive Fassikioff and one Alfred Smith, a student at Howard University,

to New York City. They arrived in New York City about 5100 a. m. on li Aprit
~1965; ang went: to the apartment “Of friends of Passikloff, (dentified as

Joseph A, and. Betty Rotandi (NR-OS Indices). ‘The Rotandi's are also de-
seribed as dedicated Communist Party members. _ During this day, Subject,
Pasaikloff and the others visited an individual identified as Blyden Jackson
(WR-OS Indices) who is the head of a nev o: ation called Coune!l for
Jobs and Freedom of Hew York (HR-0S Indices). Subject and others also
“ended up" at the West Side W. B. B. Dubois Club in Nev York City. (The

W. BE. B. Dubois Clubs are well identified as @ new National Marxist organi-
air ges by J. Edgar Hoover as “apawned by the Communist Farty,

6. There are a mmber of questions currently unanswered in the case
of the Bubject persons. Among these are: How long has James Wilcott
been involved in the SNCC movement?; Where was Elsie Wilcott during the
trip to New York Gity; and Why did James Wilcott allow himself to become
involved in this matter to the extent of going to Nev York City with these
persons and visiting other individuals who are allegedly self-admitted
Communists ?

Te Subject has apparently reported to his atation at DHAVE. How-
ever, itis believed that his involvement with the aforementioned individuals
is extremely serious, for the most yart because of unanswered questions.
Therefore, it ie considered that he should be interviewed in depth as soon
es possible regarding hie involvement in this matter. Tt 19 recommended



"CONFIDENTIAL

that the Security Officer, JMWAVE be briefed on this case and asked to
