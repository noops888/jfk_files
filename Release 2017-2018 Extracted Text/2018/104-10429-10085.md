Week of 27 - 31 July 1964

Interrogation on 27 July 1964 ran from 1334 to 1828 hours. With
the exception of social amenities ani a review of the notes SUBINCT had
nade since his last interview with the Case Officer, the interrogation
consisted of a review of the OSWALD ca: It was besed on a verbatim
transcript the Case Officer had typed from the 3 July 1964 tape. The
Case Officer (Thomas RYAN) questioned SIBJBCT on why KGB did not do
certain things such as run an investigation of OSWALD, check into his
Marine experience, etc.

On 29 July 1964 (a.m.) the doctor made his weekly examination of
the SUBJECT. SUBJECT gave a brief run-down of his personal life before
his father died in 1958, said he was being kept in confinement because
he is trying to help us and said we are still taking pictures of him but
the clicking has become quieter.

On.29_July.196% interrogation ran from’1530 hours to 1802 hours.
The OSWALD case was discussed again and the Case-Officer’ started a. .
discussion on how people obtain and keep guns in their homes in Russia.
We also wanted. to reconcile the fact that SUBJECT at one time stated
OSWALD was a poor shot but on another occasion said he was a good marksman.

The Case Officer then went into a fiscussion of a Paris based, American,
U. 8. Government employee who was recruited by the KGB. This individual was
still in Paris in January. 1964. He would make docwnents available to KGB so
they could be photographed and returned to the vault on the same day.
SUBJECT had no identifying data on this American. The discussion concerned
the American's contacts, station location, travel routes, etc.

On 32 July 1964 interrogation started at U6 hours. Questions and
discussion concerned the Intovrist Organization ond the extent to which
it serves as a cover for KGB people, KCB war emergency plans, and the
extent to which these plans were activated at the time of the U. S./Cubvan
Crisis.

The last item discussed was the ODMSSA case. ODFSSA is the code nane
for an agent’ nanied who was scheduled to go to Tokyo in April 196h.

of the Bulgarian MVD. He was settled in the Metropole Hotel and kept ° ~

A copy of the written request went to KGB. A copy of this request vas
sent to the Suprene Soviet after OSYALD slashed his wrists.

KGB studiea reports on OSWALD prepared by case Officer KRUZNOF and
decided OSWALD was not normal so he was of no interest to KGB and was
not considered desirable for Soviet citizenship. His file was sent to
Minsk because he was to live and work in Minsk.

OSWALD's case was not the same as other Americans in Russia because

Word went from Mexico to the First Main Directorate to the Second Main
Directorate. Second Main Directorate told First Main Directorate that
he had tried suicide in Russia, married a Soviet citizen, departed Russia
and was considered not normal so the request should be rejected.
