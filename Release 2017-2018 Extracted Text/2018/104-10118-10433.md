PROJECT LIONION

Biante)

Identification. This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance
operation against the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

Objectives. The operation is designed to (1) furnish photographic coverage
during daylight hours of the entrances of the target installation, (2)
dispatch physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the
target, and (3) keep in readiness'a listening post for the monitoring and
recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

The target installation is the PERUMEN Exbessy compound (including
Consulate) in Mexico City. The above-listed objectives are accomplished by
two treined, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street fron
the target. !
|

Tae project is in consonance|with Priority A, Objective 1, of the
current Related Mission Directive, for Mexico.

Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the first time,
does not represent a new operation. LIONION activity has been going on since
1962 and costs have heretofore beén charged to PERUMEN FI funds, ‘The

operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMEN Embassy,
both staff and visitors. These photographs are normally reviewed for identi-

w ey are shown
Of those assets to whom
they ere routinely shown, LETAMIL+9)has to date made the largest number of
identifications. The photos have|proven of great value. Within hours of the
arrivel of a new Enbassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the
Station, In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos
(accompanied by a log kept by the|LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action
(arrivals and departures) and details of personal associations (who associates
with whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against
the target. |
|

In eddition to photography, BIONION-1 and LIONION-2 are often called upon
to do visual surveillance of the target installation end LIONION-l is essential
to the dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance team against individuals
associated with the target. Because of the presence.of police patrol cars in
tue vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets. cannot come close to the
target, hence the need for LIONION-1's dispatching services.

The presence of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 a1so insures continued occupancy of
® valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the
Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in the
terzet in the form of concealed radio transmitters,

D. Operational Assets (Personnel), '

LIONION-1 is a young PERUMEN lawyer in exile. He left PBRUMEY in 1960,
Planning to continue on via Mexico to the United States where he resided in
his early years. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer
in the Department of Commerce in Washington, the other a police official in «
Tampa, Florida. While in Mexico LIONION-1 was recruited, as LILILY-1, to
perform PERUMEN operational support services for the Station and, once having
a taste of clandestine activity, decided to remain in Mexico. LIONION-2, his
mother, was recruited in 1961, as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and
operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE technical operation aimed at the PERUMEN
Enbassy. At thie same tine LIONION] also Phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work ana
the two worked together as a team. In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked
together in processing the take of the LIFEAT/LIERODE/MKTRAP installation, now
known es LIGMEN. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-1 and
2 to LIPSUD-22 ana 25, respectively. In the latter part of 1962 the two agents i
began the present photographic surveillance operation.

LIONION-1 was granted an OA on 18 May 1962 by HMMW~10664, He was
LCFLUITERED on 8 October 1963, HNMW-12064,

LIONION-2 was granted an OA on 16 May 1962 by HMMW~-10660.

LIONION-1 is the mainstay of the operation. LIONION-2 acts as his assistant
and fill-in at such times as he is absent from the observation post. Both serve
principally as observers and photographers. LIONION-1 also acts as-a dispatcher
for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team from which he is compartmented. Dispatching
is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not
know LIONION-1 or his precise location. LIONION-1 also ‘Processes on the premises
all photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping
and mounting. Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through the
negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the Imowledge, on the part of
the agents, that as PBRUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might
be brought upon them by KUBARK through the Mexican government should they get out
of line, Motivation is a combination of financial necessity end violent aversion
to, and determination to bring about the downfall of, the AMTHUG regime. An
ditional motivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what for many would |

monotonous work. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of work.

Both agents realize that they are working for PBPRIME intelligence} LIONION-1
pears to be aware that he is working-for KUBARK. The cover utilized by LIONION-2
that of dependent mother. LIONION-1 passes as a would-be writer who can afford
dabble without notable publishing success because of family landholdings in
mpa, Florida (inherited from his deceased father), which enable him to live as
entista," one vho lives on income from sources other than gainful employment.

S reritista status is registered with the Mexican government. In October 1964
this cover successfully withstood intensive investigation by Mexican authorities
checking on persons of questionable status fa tax collection ourp ‘The
Station plans to bolster the writing cover with supporting documents from a
literary agent in New York Citys these will ve requested in separate correspondence.



i
Commmication is primarily with LIONION-1; with LIONION-2 only in his
absence. Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls
from LIONION-1 go through a telephone cut-out), are usually held at the
LIONION-1 safe apartment. This apartment, which would appear to be a LIONION-L
love nest, is in another area of town, ‘he Station KURIOT technicien, e
Hugh T. FRANCOTTE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week. The Case Officer,
Lawrence F, BARKER, meets with him less frequently. Whereas LIONION-1 knows
the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOTTE's true identity.

E, Security Zyeluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican
authorities. as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed
to indicete that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMMAVE
area on e voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering
their income. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flegrante
with the KURICT eutomatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such i
refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization. i
In any event, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican
president's office. This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,
enabled him to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome any
future difficulties with Mexican authorities.

Under Mexican law, the principal (photographic) activity of the project is
not illegal, therefore uncovering of the photographic operation would not of
itself result in arrest or prosecution. Tt is usually possible to stave off
investigation or house seareh for a period of time sufficient to remove compronis-
ing uaterial from the premises. ‘The LIONION base house was once cleaned completely
in one evening ena could again be cleaned, probably in less time, if circumstances
should warrent. ~

The terget installation is aware that photo surveillance is a probability.
On one occesion AMKNOB~-1, a JMWAVE asset, was shown a nearby building (not the

LIONION base) by a PBRUMEN Bubassy officer and told that it was @ KUBARK photo
base.

LIONION-1 is Imown by sight to some PBRUMEN Euoassy staff personnel who have
observed him in the neighborhood. ,Presumably they believe he is a Mexican. To
avoid overaticral compromise, he cannot renew his expired passport at the
PBRUMEN Consulate. For this reason the Station will request KURIOP in separate
correspondence to vrepare new passports for both LIONION agents so that they say
travel outside Mexico.

Security measures employed in this operation are designed to make it virtually
impossible for any opposition service to link LIONION personnel with the Station,

B. Coordination, Coordination with otier PBPRIME elements or the ilexican gover
is not necessary at this time and none is envisaged.
