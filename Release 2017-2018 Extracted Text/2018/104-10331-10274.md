of several points she asked for a copy of a cable found in the

file that lists the chronology of the contacts with the two

ladies. That copy was provided via FAX on the same day.

5. (Susan told me that IP&CRD has recommended that we, ie,.

CIA, request Ms. Naman to submit a formal FOIA request for the

photos.

The file review suggests to her, however,

that a

letter telling Ms. Naman that CIA's record indicates the photos

had been returned, may be more politic.

Evidently (Susan) wants

to talk to (Page Moffitt, DD/OCA, about the request so the

response is still undecided. I

told her that

I was returning

the file folder to the file but. that I could retrieve it again

if necessary.

It could be that they will want to review the

file folder for themselves. More to come?

6. Copies of Representative Lagomarsino's letter and the

CIA cable noted previously are

attached for information.

Warren Commission

Assasination Book

Dear Bob:

It has been many years now since I first shook your hand when you

were originally running for office and I met you at the catele

auction yard in Buellton.

I have appreciated your keeping me informed via your newsletter

but am enclosing 3 envelopes showing duplication of two, which

are incorrect. I have marked them VOID and theproper one to use.

You have always responded to me when I have asked you or been

concerned about anything.

Iam troubled by many things today but

at the top of my list is the ENVIRONMENT and costly and wasteful

$ Grants (our taxpayer money) given to unethical people for EXPERIMENIS

ON ANIMALS.

I even got a letter from Casper Weinberger saying the

D. O.D. felt it was necessary for the protection of the United States

for the military to shoot, maim, and kill animals - even dogs.

Oh now REALLY!! Come on.

Lets get all this craziness and waste

stopped. We have enough

Injured real bodies around without animal testing.

The other item that has been renewed for me is all the recent interest

in the JFk Assasination.

You might remember that as a plain old tourist

I took a picture in Minsk where later we found Lee Harvey oswald to be

in the picture.

I was glad to give this to the CiA with the understanding

they would return my slide together with 3 blowups 8 x 10 color.

To this day my efforts and yours have been unsuccessful.

through the FBI, which was an error on the part of you or your office

- I had said it was the CIA who interviewed me and to whom I entrusted

my picture. If you did contact the CIA I never did hear from them.

The FBI did respond but merely said they knew nothing about it.

I would still like to have my colored alide back, together with the

3 color 8 x 10 they promised me. Would you please try again, but be

sure its the CIA.

Probably because of this picture there must be some sort of a

file on

me:

so would you kindly arrange for me to have my file through the

Freedom of Information Act.

Thank you kindly,

5019.

1 laman.

luffingion is a threat, but i am telling people how resporsive you have

lage been to me, and YOU Do PROPPOT dUE ENVIRONMENT.)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:

HRG

SUBJECT:

Request for Information from the Oswald 201 File to

Support

an OCA FOIA Request

.. On Wednesday, 20 May 1992,

the OCA FOIA

)fficer, asked for my help in servicing a request fro

Representative Lagomarsino on behalf of one of his

constituents, Ms. Rita Naman. The request was for the return

of a slide and some photographs that were provided in the

As those files

are now in the

possession of HRG Susan called to ask our help.

I became the

HRG contact only because she and I were conferring on another

subject when the request came in and

she used one telephone

call to accomplish a double mission.

2. As luck would have it Barry had found an index of some

in the 201 File that listed a "Photo of OSWALD in

Minsk."

A short search located the file folder; VOLUME 35,

BULKY, XAAZ 22420, 29 Apr 64, SR/CI Study:

Photo of OSWALD

in

Minsk, in Box #9. The folder contains a collection of MERs,

documents, notes and photographs regarding the acquisition of

some photographs and a movie reel from 2 women that had been

traveling in the USSR in 1961.

of the travelers. Also included in the folder were 2 slides.

3.

According to the file record the movie reel that was

provided by Ms. Naman was returned to her by mail in March

1962.

The slides provided by Ms. Kramer, the other traveler,

were

also returned in May of that year. The record notes in

addition that five slides of the 160 provided (presumably by

Ms. Kramer) were "accessioned."

NOTE:

"accessioned" means that they were added to

the photographic collection of the Graphics Register.

The Graphics collection

was split with the ground

photos going to

NPIC and the personality photos going

to the area divisions of OCR/ISG. Keeping up with

organizational shifts these personality photos

• should

now be in LDA files? - that is if they haven't been

purged.

4. After conferring with Mr. Pereira, C/HRG and MI.

Carver, HRG,

on Friday, 22 May 1992, I called(Susan)with the

search results on Tuesday, 26 May 1992. Following discussion
