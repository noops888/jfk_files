Second Working Draft

CUBA
THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES
AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

an Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede the
flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin American
countries, Execution of any one or more of the enumerated
actions will ameliorate the situation; execution of them
all will not completely solve it. The practical problems
involved are too numerous and complex.

With respect to diminishing legitimate travel to Cuba,
we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes of
those Latin American countries through which the subversive
traveller must pass. From the viewpoint of these nations
the direct actions required have strong political and some-
times legal implications; implications which cannot be over-
come easily, even where the leaders of these countries
choose to do so.

In the matter: of clandestine travel, we are confronted

ia not only with the great depth of communist guile, born of two

generations of experience in the international movement of

SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32424091 Page 5


SECRET

subversives, but with the inexperience, ineptitude and
lack of awareness in these same matters on the part of
the Latin American community.

In spite of this, the advantages do not all reside
with the communists. Cuba is an island. Its insular
character imposes certain sharp limitations upon personal
movement. Cuba has no frontiers with other states; every-
one who enters the country must do so either by water,
or air, There can be no slipping through the barbed wire,

On the other hand, this same geographic situation
makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple. There
are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpatrolled Central
American coastline, between 175 and 850 miles of Cuba, There
are-at least 93 airfields, other than United States, within
700 miles of the island, and the ships and craft, indigenous
to the Caribbean and capable of supporting the subversive
ebb and flow, number well into the thousands.

Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a
program of direct restraints, selected from among the actions
enumerated herein, can have favorable effects. Under the
proposed steps some travel would be stopped completely,

More - probably much more - would be rendered difficult.

Some hitherto legitimate movement would be driven underground.

Previous clandestine.movement would be impeded, compli-
cated and harassed to the point where it becomes more
costly, more uncertain, more hazardous and thus, hope-

fully, less: extensive.

Il. Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about the movement of subversive
trainees into Cuba and - more important - out of Cuba. We
do not know enough about the volume of travel, or the media
employed. This is particularly true in the area of illicit
traffic, where our knowledge is extemely limited.

Regarding legitimate travel to Cuba, CIA presents the
following estimate:

While some of these travellers proceeded to Cuba by
other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico on
their way. On the most conservative basis, then, it will
be seen that there cannot have been fewer than 4912 travellers
to Cuba during the year 1962, while the average monthly
number passing through México for the first two months of
1963 is even higher than the 1962 average.

Of the total number visiting Cuba, the Central Intelli-
gence Agency estimates that at least 1500, and perhaps as
many as 2000, have received ideological indoctrination or
guerrilla warfare training. Many of these are still in
Cuba. Others have returned to their homelands; some by
legitimate means; some probably by illicit means.

Prior to the October crisis, Latin Americans travelling
to Cuba usually moved by regular commercial airlines or, on
occasion, by specially chartered Cubana flights. Some
travelled to Trinidad or Curacao and thence by regularly.
scheduled Cubana or KLM flights to Havana. ‘Others travelled
to Mexico, and from there by Mexicana or Cubana commercial
flights to Havana. With the cessation of service to Cuba
by. Pan American, KLM, Mexicana, and Iberia airlines in
October, the regular Cubana service between Mexico City
and Havana remained the sole direct and regular airline

connection betwen Cuba and the remainder of Latin America.

The Cubana service between Havana and Mexico is scheduled
to operate twice weekly, but sometimes only a single flight is
completed per week. -Aircraft now employed are British Bri-
tannias -- an obsolescent model. Cubana has requested, but
has not yet received, Mexican approval to substitute Soviet
IL-18 transports for the old Britannias. Delay by the Mexicans
in granting this approval can have the favorable effect of
impeding travel, as the Britannias are now in poor condition,
If, in addition, the British and Canadians can be induced. to
suspend delivery of spare parts, the planes will soon become
inoperative:

Iberia airlines resumed its regular twice-monthly
flights from Madrid to Havana.on 11 February. This flight
makes one stop, in the Azores, before reaching Havana.

KLM has not yet resumed its regular flights to Cuba
from the Netherlands Antilles. However, it ls now considering
doing so. In this regard it is concluded that resumption of
scheduled flights by a United States carrier could serve as
an.encouragement to KIM and others to do the same.

Soviet and Czech airlines serving Cuba do not stop
regularly at any other Latin American country, though the
Soviet Aeroflot line has occasionally sought and received

permission from Brazil to land at Recife, en route to Cuba.

Some Latin Americans may have travelled to Cuba on-these
infrequent flights and, should Brazil permit this arrange-
ment to become regularized, the movement of subversives
could achieve a new order of magnitude.

A Canadian non-scheduled line has operated a few
flights from Canada to Havana and return, carrying both
material and personnel. The Canadians have been unrespon-
sive to our efforts to obtain identification of the passengers.

There are no regularly scheduled sea carriers operating
between Latin America and Cuba. However, a number of trainees
from British Guiana have travelled to Cuba aboard unscheduled
Cuban merchant vessels engaged in transporting rice from
Guiana to Cuba.

Clandestine sources report that transit of Latin
Americans through Mexico to Cuba often involves illict pro-
cedures. The Cuban embassy in Mexico City provides the
travellers, whom they identify as tourists, with special
Cuban entry papers; no entry is made in their passports,
and they are given pseudonyms for travel out of and into
Mexico. This procedure is obviously designed to impede
any effort by the other Latin American governments subse-
quently to identify the travellers and to exercise survetl-

lance over their activities upon their return.

Evidence at hand portrays a substantial flow of travel
by legal means, This must be countered directly. Beyond
this, and perhaps: of greater importance, is the problem of
illicit movement both into and out of Cuba, which will un-
doubtedly assume growing proportions as legal travel is
curtailed, and about which our intelligence is at present
most limited. Elimination of this void must be accorded high

priority.

III. The attitudes of the Latin American Nations

Success of many of the overt actions proposed in
the sections to follow will turn upon the attitudes of the
Latin American nations within whose borders the restraining
actions must take place, Presented briefly below is an
estimate of what can be expected from the various sectors
of Latin America in terms of participation in a coordinated
program of travel control.

As a general matter, the imposition of controls on
travel is not popular with the public in any Latin American
country. This, coupled with their current lack of full
awareness of the danger represented by Cuba's training of
subversives, will diminish the willingness of some govern-
ments to impose controls unilaterally. This is especially
true since they ‘recognize that unilateral restraints will
have little effect on curbing the travel of their nationals
to Cuba, if supporting multilateral action is not also taken.
It is likely, however, that most of the Latin American
countries would respond favorably -- albeit in varying
degrees -- to US leadership in seeking to reduce the flow
of persons to Cuba for ideological or subversive training.

The Central American countries are more acutely aware
of the danger posed by Cuban-inspired subversion than is

Latin America at large, and can be expected to react

SECRET 9

HW 50955 DocId:32424091 Page 13


SECRET

favorably to proposals for reducing travel to Cuba which
President Kennedy might present at the San Jose Presidential
meeting. However, their ability to carry out commitments
made under such circumstances will be limited by domestic
legal and political considerations, as well.as by their
countries! technical incompetence in such matters.

Since Mexico is currently the only hemisphere transit
point for legal travel of subversives to and from Cuba; the
attitude of that country toward the problem is of great
importance. Mexico,to date, has taken three significant
steps with respect to travel between Mexican cities and
Cuba. It has instituted close surveillance over travellers,
to include stamping passports to evidence travel to Cuba.

In addition, the Mexicans now photograph, covertly, all
persons arriving from or departing for Cuba, and have given
tacit approval to suspension of Cuban service by Compania
Mexicana de Aviacion (CMA). These actions all suggest that
Mexico might be induced to take even further cooperative
steps, particularly on an unpublicized, bi-lateral basis,
wherein the political hazards of a public OAS position are
not involved, In this regard, the Central American Presidents
would probably agree individually to seek the participation
of President Lopez Mateos of Mexico in specific cooperative
moves to restrict the flow of persons to Cuba through that
country.

SECRET 10

BW 50955 DocId:32424091 Page 14

Peru now has regulations which actually prohibit
travel to Cuba, but the regulations have engendered public
resistance, and are not enforced. The Dominican Republic
prohibits such travel. Haiti has no established policy,
but passports and exit permits are reportedly issued only
on personal approval of President Duvalier. Colombia
could legally impose restrictions by executive decree, but
has shown no inclination to do so, Other countries, such
as Venezuela, Chile, and the Central American nations;
plead the existence of legal or constitutional barriers
which preclude the prohibition of travel to Cuba, but thus
far, they have made little effort to remove these barriers.

Five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chihe, Uruguay,
Mexico, and Bolivia) now maintain diplomatic relations with
Cuba. Brazil continues its drift to the left and gives
little evidence of modifying its tolerant attitude toward
the Castro government. Chile, with a legal Communist Party,
exercises no restraints on travel to Cuba, either direct
or via third country. It is to be expected that these five
countries, with some possible exceptions in the case of
Mexico, will be the least cooperative in restricting travel
to Cuba.

The elimination of all legitimate passenger service
to Cuba from Latin America could be achieved through

invocation of the Rio Treaty, but it is unlikely that the
hemisphere countries would agree to do so in the absence of
some major crisis similar to that involving the Soviet missiles
or a case of direct Cuban intervention in another Latin
American country. Nevertheless, a campaign on our part to
develop a full awareness of the danger represented by the
flow of Castro-trained subversives would probably create a
growing willingness to take action oriented in this direction.
In this connection, however, it is concluded that resumption
of regular passenger service to Cuba by the United: States
would render more difficult our efforts to persuade the

Latin American. countries to take a grave view of the situ-
ation, and to participate in dynamic action.

Virtually, all the Latin American countries would be
willing to move against Cuban-trained subversives upon their
return to home countries, particularly when the trainee's
conduct gave clear evidence of his subversive intent. An
essential factor, however, is the realization that the efforts
of these nations will not be dramatically effective since, in
the area of internal security, all of them suffer from de-
ficiencies in technical skill, training, equipment and some-
times from a lack of a sense. of urgency. The United States
ean provide essential leadership in eliminating all of these
deficiencies,

Iv. Actions Concerning Legitimate Travel

Listed below are specific actions contemplated to
impede legitimately executed travel, to and from Cuba.
Legitimate travel is characterized, for this purpose,
as travel on recognized public carriers, openly arranged
and involving travel documents which are presumed to be in
proper order. Certain of the actions, it will be noted,
are partially in effect. Others have been proposed to the
OAS ~ wholly or in part - by the Special Consultative
Committee on Security.

a. Immediate Impact Actions

The following.actions offer promise of producing
early, visible and effective results.
(1) Intelligence Actions
(a) Intensify U.S@¢ intelligence efforts in
each country to identify persons who have traveled,
or intend to travel, to Cuba, and report selected
information promptly to the host government, as
may be consistent with our own intelligence pro-
gram, and the requirement to protect our sources.
(b) Intensify current efforts to introduce
covert, U.S. - controlled agents from each country
into the Cuban training program.
(2) Administrative Actions
(a) Induce each Western Hemisphere country to:

SECRET 13

HW 50955 DoclId:32424091 Page 17


® @
SECRET

i. Stamp passports or other travel ‘documents
issued to own nationals "not valid for travel
to Cuba".

2. Refuse exit permits for Cuba to any
national of a third country who cannot produce
a valid permit issued by his own country for
travel to Cuba.

3s Refuse to honor any visa for Cuba which
is not an integral, non-detachable part of the
travel document issued by the country of which
the traveller is a citizen,

4, Require accurate manifests of all carriers
departing for or arriving from Cuba, and furnish
copies of these manifests to diplomatic missions
of:.other Western Hemisphere countries which are
affected.

(b) Persuade Mexico to fingerprint, in addition
to photographing, all persons leaving for or arriving
from Cuba, and to provide data to the parent country
of the nationals involved.

(c) Make covert arrangements with police and
other security and administrative officials in
countries now being used for legal transit to Cuba
to impose administrative impediments and harassment
on Cuba-bound travellers, in order to increase the

SECRET 14

® ®
SECRET

difficulty of travel and thus discourage pro-
spective travellers.
(8) Actions in Regard to Common Carriers

(a) Prohibit resumption of air service to
Cuba by U.S, carriers, in order to provide a
favorable example to other nations who may be
contemplating similar steps. ;

(b) Expand current restrictions on foreign
shipping engaging in commerce with Cuba by
closing United States ports to all ships of
any shipping line which continues to send any
ships to Cuban ports.

(ce) Request Latin American countries to
prohibit ships arriving from or departing for
Cuba from embarking or disembarking passengers
in thier ports.

(a) Request Latin American countries to deny
their ports to Cuban ships.

(4) Propaganda Actions

(a) Pursue a hemisphere-wide publicity campaign
to expose the scope and purpose of Cuban training
of the nationals of other countries for sub-
versive purposes, in order to discourage pro-

spective trainees and impress the governments

SECRET

and the peoples concerned with the urgent
need to halt the travel of Latin American
nationals to Cuba.
b. Longer Range Actions
The following actions should also be undertaken
without delay. Their ultimate results may be of far-
reaching importance, but probably will be longer
in realization.
(1) Political Actions

(a) Renew and intensify bilateral negotiations
with the five Latin American governments which
have not done so to sever diplomatic relations with
Cuba,

(b) Through bilateral negotiations press
countries with inadequate legal restrictions on
travel to Cuba to adopt laws enabling the prohibi-
tion of such travel and providing severe penalties
for evasion. Recommend that.rewards be offered
for identification of evaders.

(c) In separate diplomatic approaches to each
country, urge full and effective cooperation with
appropriate OAS bodies, and bilaterally among the
several states, in the interchange of information
concerning travel of persons to Cuba and other
Castro-Communist subversive activities. ‘ 1

(d) Propose periodic regional meetings of
ministers of the Central American nations to review
the implementation of steps taken by two or more
of them to combat subversive movement in the
Caribbean.

(e) Urge other Latin American nations to
negotiate separately and/or collectively with
Mexico, Uruguay, Brazil and Chile in order to enlist
cooperation in adopting specific measures to prevent
the movement through their countries of third
country personnel to and from Cuba.

(2) Intelligence Actions

Intensify our action in making available to
each country selected intelligence concerning the
extent, nature, and insidious implications, of
Cuban subversive activities, as consistent with the
requirement to protect our own intelligence program.
(3) Administrative Actions

(a) Encourage Latin American governments to
institute administrative procedures, such as
exhaustive examination of manifests, air-worthiness
checks of aircraft, baggage inspection and inspect-
ion of health and other documents, all designed

deliberately to delay and otherwise make difficult

DocId:32424091 Page 21


SECRET

the carrying of passengers to Cuba.

(b) Request governments of Latin American
countries which persist in maintaining diplomatic
relations with Cuba to expose the falsification
of travel documents by Cuban embassies or ‘con-
sulates, and take punitive measures, such as the
expulsion of Cuban diplomatic personnel, to bring
such illegal activity to a halt. Provide U.S,
technical assistance as requested.

(c) Intensify technical assistance to Latin
American countries in improving immigration and
customs controls.

(4) Actions Related to Common Carriers

(a) If unable to cause Mexico to halt Cubana
Airlines service altogether, persuade Mexico to
refuse the introduction of Soviet-made aircraft in
the Havana-Mexico City route on technical grounds,
This will create an obstacle to Cubana, since the
Brittania aircraft now used are in disrepair.

(b) Request again of Great Britain, Canada, and
any other potential supplier that they cut off the
supply of spare parts for Cuba's Britania aircraft.

(c) Conduct negotiations with the Netherlands,

Mexico, Canada and Spain to persuade those countries

SECRET 18

SECRET

to stop, or refrain from reestablishing,
commercial air flights to Cuba. Enlist the
cooperation of other Western Hemisphere countries
normally providing terminal service for any of
the airlines involved, such as Venezuela and
Trinidad, in applying pressure.
(5) Propaganda Actions
(a) Intensify USIA and CIA input of propaganda
in Latin American public information media discredit-
ing the Cuban training effort, exposing the hazard
which it holds for Latin American tranquility,and
discrediting persons who have undergone subversive
training, in order to discourage. possible volunteers
and develop popular opposition to such activities.
(b) Identify returned trainees who are dis-
satisfied with thier Cuban training experience and
exploit thier capabilities for provision of intelli-
gence and propaganda material for exposing and
discrediting Castro-Communist subversive activities.
(c) Initiate a publicity campaign throughout
Latin America, not attributable to the United States,
which focusses unfavorably on the use of Mexican,
Uruguayan, Brazilian, and Chilean transit facilities
for movement af persons of other countries to and
from Cuba for subversive purposes.

ce. Organization of American States (OAS) Actions

In view of the important political, psychological,
and, hopefully, material benefits to be derived from
any success achieved through the OAS in combatting
Cuban subversive activity, the following measures
should be pursued by the United States in that ‘body,
at times and under circumstances which give regard ‘to
the need to preserve hempsheric solidarity, and
give recognition to the fact that progess will
probably be slow.

(1) Pursue adaption by the OAS of a resolution
calling upon all member states to sever diplomatic
relations with Cuba, thus impeding the travel of
subversives to Cuba by legal means, and at the same
time, creating serious obstacles to other related
Cuban subversive activities.

(2) Propose a recommendation by the OAS to. member
governments of a program of steps, on both the
national and international levels, to control travel
by their nationals to Cuba, utilizing the proposals
in the report by the Special Consultative Committee
on Security (SCCS).as. well as the specific recommen-

dations set forth herein,

SECRET 20

NW 50955 DocId:32424091 Page 24


SECRET @ eG

(3) Once the initial comprehensive program in
(2) above is recommended, utilize the appropriate
OAS bodies to follow up on implementation through
such means as multilateral exchange of information,
meeting of experts, and utilization by individual
countries of the services of the Special Consultative
Committee on Security. :

(4) Propose adoption by the OAS of a resolution,
binding upon all member states, to terminate air and
maritime carrier traffic with Cuba.

(5) Recommend action by the OAS to establish a
public information program focussing on the threat
to the hemisphere posed by Cuban subversive training

activities.

Ve Actions Concerning Illegal Travel

As the actions outlined in the preceding sections
become effective, one of the results will be to force the
hitherto legitimate travel into clandestine channels. It
may, therefore, be expected that measures to impede illegal
movement will acquire steadily increasing importance.

The steps proposed herein are listed, as in the
preceding section, in terms of immediate impact projects
which promise early and visible results, .and longer range
projects which, while of great importance, cannot be ex-

pected to mature as rapidly.
