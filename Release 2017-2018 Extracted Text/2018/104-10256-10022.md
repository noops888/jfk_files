Yiendship wit MACKEM did not appear to have previ- -~
ously known any‚Äù oO Agency employees at the party.

3. (C) It should be noted that MACKEM has been of
interest te this Agency since his termination (reduction
in force) in October 1973. Interest was predicated upon
his association with Mitchell Livingston WERBELL III (OS?
27_686) and the latter's "Friends 0 aca" operation.
Recent interest in MACKEM stemmed from the "B. A. Fox"
letter bomb extortion case in which MACKEM was considered
by the FBI to have been a possible suspect. That case,
investigated by the FBI during the latter part of 1975,
currently appears to have been put on "the back burner"
by the FBI.
