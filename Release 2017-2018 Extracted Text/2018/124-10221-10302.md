and Commanding Officer of a weapons platoon in a Ranger
battalion. In the latter function, POSADA would very

likely have received demolitions training. In March

1965 POSADA was recruited by the Agency to serve as a
Maritime Training Branch instructor in Florida. Information
at that time indicated that he already was reported to be

a "demolitions expert". POSADA also was used as a source

of information on Cuban exile activities. In 1965 POSADA

was involved with Luis SIERRA Lopez who was working with
Roberto ALEJOS Arzu, a Guatemalan who was attempting to
overthrow the Guatemalan Government. POSADA was of interest
to the SIERRA/ALEJOS group because of his knowledge of
demolitions and weapons. POSADA reported to the Agency

and later to the FBI, on his involvement in and the activities
of this-yroup (and subsequent other Cuban exile activist
organizations with which he became affiliated). As of

August 1966 he was used solely as an informant on the activities
of the Cuban Representation in Exile (RECE), a Miami-based
exile group. POSADA was formally terminatediin July 1967

In August 1967 he was mentioned in a Havana Radio broadcast
as-a liaison man between the Agency and RECE. In August

1967 POSADA moved to Caracasfnd secured a position with
DIGEPOL, the Venezuelan security service (now known as

DISIP).
