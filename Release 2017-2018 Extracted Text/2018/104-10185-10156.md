followire information concerning MORO:

MORO is a very hard worker and works with preciaton and accuracy.

moderation. He is serious, perhaps excemaively reserved, but does not

lack communication or the capacity to Inapire aympathy from both hi

collcagucs st the Embrosy and the lailan's with whom he comes in contact.

He never speaks of his lamily. His commercial work at the Embay

follows the normal oftice routine without any particular security treatmenl..

He hiring of technical personnel is considered extremely clanallied and he

refers there mattere directly to the ambassador; no one elec is authorized

to have contact with candidatea for work in his ared.

MORO does not una

Perez and Odina ROJAS Trete, both second secretaries at the Cuban Embassy

in Rome, have been lovers for sometime and live togcther at Via Cubond 16
