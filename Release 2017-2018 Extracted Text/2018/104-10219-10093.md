Soviet Union. Siz had no interest in undergrot

published abroad. Ic is unlikely Subject would have read such material
or participated in dissident activities even had she had the chance to do
so, as Subject and her husband dained the efforts of the Soviet
dissidents as foolish and pointless. Subject hers: secondary
educaticn and limited mentality. She is not interested in idsological

read much of anything, forbiccen or otherwise.

None. Subject has difficulty differentiating between the
nationalities of the Soviet Union and tends to lump
certain of then together uncer convenient generic terms, such as
"Siriytsy" (Syrians) for Soviets of Turkic or other Moslem nationality
descent. Subject had no interest in the plight of rinority nationalities
in the USSR. She recognized it was her Jewish ancestry which helped

her to cnigrate legally from the USSR, but that is as far as it went.
