MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

THROUGH : Chief, Security Research Staff
FROM : M. K. Holbik, IRD
SUBJECT : Project AMWORLD

1. The purpose of this memorandum is to apprise you of
certain information about Project AMWORLD which I feel you should
know, if you donot already, and to avoid possible embarrassment to
the Agency and to the Office of Security. Its purpose is not to dis-
credit Mr. Henry HECKSHER, the former Project head, or any other
persons who have been affiliated with the Project.

2. Until July 1964, while a Security Officer assigned to
DDP/SAS, the majority of my time was devoted to Subject. Recent
Project developments, coupled with remarks that have been made to
me about this Project, have motivated mein submitting this. account
to you for your information. :

3. Project AMWORLD was and is a so-called autonomous"
operation, In theory, as I understand it, the Agency would firnish
funds and materials, but the actual handling, direction, or control
of the Proj ect would be by the Project head, Manuel ARTIME; crypto-
nym AMBIDDY/1. Te second ranking Cuban in the Project was

iq Rafael QUINTERO, sphose cryptonym was AMPAVA/4 Gl Until this
summer, HER was the Agency staff employee jin charge of
Subject. HECKSHER was succeeded by Mr Nestor ‘QANCHEZ. hs

SHER. was one of the several special assistants to Mr. Fitzgerald,
then the Chief of SAS. This small group was extremely loyal to

ISRNANDEZ; her husbandgRaul HBRNANDEZ; *



HECKSHER, particularly Raul and. Bobbie HERNANDEZ. They re-
portedly will join HECKSHER at his néw assignment in Venezuela.
The staff ern loyee in Miami who handled AMWORLD matters was
Mx(_Karl ROHRER, It is believed that most of ROHR eo contacts
in Miami, [on behalf of the Project, were with Dr BAROQ,?
whose cryptonym was AMYUM/19. BARO, until a fallihg out with
ARTIME, had been the number three man in the Project. As of my
departure from SAS, then WH/SA, ROHRER was assigned to the
British Guiana Desk of WH and I believe was located in Barton Hall,
ROHRER returned from Miami to Headquarters in about the early
summer of 1964. After returning, he showed some bitterness toward
the Project and commented that ARTIME was a weak man, a poor
leader, of questionable morals, and that Cuban Project personnel,
including QUINTERO and BARO were about ready to leave ARTIME's
group, the MRR. ROHRER opined to me that the Project was "doomed".
ROHRER ‘was then a Junior Officer Trainee, GS-8. I personally be-
lieve that, if necessary, information could be elicited from ROHRER
on a confidential basis.

4, Since leaving WH/SA, I have had occasional contact with
persons:who were then and/or are now assigned to WH and who were
these contacts have ranged

< Al RODRIGUEZNboth of whom were super
grade spécial assistants to Mr. Fitzgerald), secretaries in the "front
office" of what was SAS, and others. Since these persons knew of my
intense involvement in the Project, they have commented to me about
it. I did not intentionally solicit their remarks. A remark that was
made to me recently renewed my effort to locate copies of certain
materials that I had extracted from files while in SAS and submit this
memorandum, The remark was, as I can recall it, "Wouldn't Senator
Goldwater have a ball if he knew about the Spanish ship and about
ARTIME's wife?" This remark caused me to do considerable thinking’
and recall.

5. As you might recall, a Spanish ship was attacked about two
weeks ago. My knowledge of the attack upon the ship is based on com-~
ments made to me by persons whom I knew while in SAS. The attack
upon the Spanish ship was reportedly made by the SS Santa Maria, one
of two AMWORLD vessels (converted Navy AKL's). I was with this
vessel in Hoboken, New Jersey, for about two weeks during the late
spring of this year, At that time the vessel was being equipped and

-_manned, As.was reported to me, the Santa Maria was cruising ‘off of

Cuba and at a.distance noted the name on the Spanish ship; I believe

it was "'Sierra'' Inu. The Santa Maria, thinking that this ship was one
of those on its "watch list", opened fire on the Spanish ship and accord-"
ing to the newspaper publicity three Spaniards were killed and the
Spanish Government was up in arms... As fate would have it, the Santa

Maria reportedly attacked the wrong ship. . The ship they were interested

in was of the same name; however, it in fact was not the Spanish ship.
I was further informed that because of this "flap'', Secretary Rusk.and
Mr. McCone immediately conferred,

6. What.is of equal or even greater concern to me relates.to
ARTIME's wife. ‘In late February 1964, He HER requested
that.I check the OS Indices in the name of Adelaida tilda PADRON’y:
Cruz, As a result of this check I made inquiry of O1 and from that
office received a report relating to PADRON. A copy of my-resultant
memorandum to Mr. HECKSHER is attached as Tab A. This,.to my
knowledge, was the first indication that PADRON, ‘who was then re-
portedly ARTIME's mistress, was possibly a Lesbian. During con-
tinued contacts with HECKSHER, 1 would discreetly inquire about
whether or not ARTIME continued to have an interest in PADRON,
HECKSHER is quite shrewd and is extremely adept at doubletalk. In
essence, he replied in the affirmative and further said that ARTIME
planned to marry her. Iam quite certain that the flow of information
to HECKSHER about PADRON was in this manner--from BARO to
ROHRER to either HERNANDEZ or HECKSHER. ‘As time went on,
judging from the material.that I saw and from the remarks. that I
heard, it was obvious that BARO and QUINTERO had absolutely no
use for PADRON. Tab B, authored’‘by HECKSHER, notes that the
political repercussions. could be "calamitous" if ARTIME married
PADRON,

7. During the next couple of months, PADRON was investigated
by INS at the Agency's request. This was arranged through the Alien
Affairs Staff. I'm told there is a Security file on her. “In addition,
there is a Subject file on her in WH Security, That investigation indi-
cated that PADRON was in all prob: bility bi-sexual and that she had
been the former mistress of Fulgengio BATISTA) For your information,
Tab C in part relates to PADRON's morals and to ARTIME's naivete.
Tab D primarily concerns QUINTERO's feeling about PADRON.



8. After my return from Hoboken, HECKSHER expressed his
appreciation to me for the departure of the ship without incident, and
was quite friendly. I then felt it prudent to again inquire about
ARTIME's plan to marry PADRON and as I recall, HECKSHER told
me that they either were married or were going to definitely be
married. I believe that during that same week HECKSHER gave me
a copy of a Dispatch with the instructions that I was to return it to
him immediately after 1 had read it. The Dispatch was extremely
damaging to PADRON. Among other things, it reported on an investi-
gation conducted by Cubans used by a ‘CI shop at JMWAVE.. The
Dispatch was RYBAT and stated that PADRON had been the mistress
of not only BATISTA, but also of former Venezuelan Dictator JIMINEZ.

"Further, it stated that PADRON and her sister were both homosexual

and had "posed" (for pornography) for BATISTA and JIMINEZ. In
addition, the Dispatch noted that informants had said that PADRON
definitely visualized herself as being the next First Lady of Cuba. It
was well known among Cubans in Miami that PADRON was undesirable
and that she was ARTIME's romantic interest. Tab E relates to a con-
versation of HECKSHER with ARTIME. I am quite certain that prior
to the date of this Dispatch (UFGA-16512), 29 June 1964, HECKSHER
requested the assistance of SAS Security and of the Alien Affairs Staff
to intervene with INS to allow PADRON's departure to Nicaragua where
she and ARTIME would reside. It should have been pointed out earlier
that by this time PADRON and ARTIME had become man and wife.

9. After I read the Dispatch, I allowed a colleague to read it
and then returned it to HECKSHER. If I had delayed its return, HECK-
SHER would have become suspicious since I had voiced my concern
about PADRON. I commented to HECKSHER that indeed the Dispatch
was extremely derogatory to PADRON and also to ARTIME. I asked
HECKSHER what he planned to do, HECKSHER shrugged his shoulders
and then said that the Agency was stuck with ARTIME and that the Dis-
patch had been shown to Messrs. Fitzgerald and Helms. Tab F isa
copy I made of a Transmittal Slip. It indicates that apparently Mr.
Fitzgerald did initiate some investigation because of the content of the
Dispatch,

10. Tab Gin part confirms the content of the Dispatch which
was derogatory to PADRON and ARTIME.

11, It would not be surprising if some of the derogatory infor-

mation about ARTIME and/or his wife has leaked out of WH/SA or the

12. Tomy knowledge, Project AMWORLD is the only Agency:
activity authorized by the White House’ to ‘conduct ‘sabotage operations
against and in Cuba. It was this group that raided and devastated:the
sugat mill in approximately the spring of this year. To my knowledge,
by Presidential request,.no sabotage operations have been launched
from. JMWAVE since about the first of the year. J gathered that per-
sonnel at JMWAVE possessed certain ill feelings toward AMWORLD
and toward ARTIME sincé it was the only operation that was allowed to
conduct sabotage operations.

13. To repeat, it is not my intent to. discredit HECKSHER, ‘to
second guess operational personnel, or to._predict future "flaps". I
view: HECKSHER as.a.skilled operator who at-times is.a "wild man".
This:-is submitted for your information. If you previously were awaré

expend time for a meaningless éndeavor. In conclusion, I apprised
my supervisor, Chet Crawford, of my intent to compile this information
cand have.asked him to peruse this memorandum.
