of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select
Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for
Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role’in the
investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
follows:

This crime.was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any-question.. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense e

of what material we are (sic) able to °

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

States at all. So when I used: here the ~

word “supportive,".I meant that in the

literal sense of the term. We are (sic)

trying to support the FBI and Support the

Warren Commission and be responsive to

their requests, but we were not initiating

any investigations of our own or, to my

recollection, were we ever asked to.

{Executive Session Testimony of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 17-18.)

On November 23, 1963 Helms called a meeting of senior-
, level CIA officials to outline the Agency's investiga-
yaggettiv responsibility vis a vis the assassination. (SSC,

“ $eelso testified before the Select Committee,
that he was. given charge of the ‘Agency's investigation
on the basis of two considerations: 1)!his prior — cee
experience in conducting major CIA security investi-
gations and 2) the observance of Oswald y(n

less than two months prior to the assassination. (ssc

5/16/70, pp. 111-112.°;' Scelso also noted that
during the course of his investigative efforts, Helms
did not pressure him to adopt specific investigative
theories nor reach conclusions within a set period of
time; Executive Session Testimony of Richard Helms ,

8/9/78, pp. 9-10)*

* Raymond Rocca, Chief of Research and Analysis for “®
CIA's Counterintelligence Staff characterized Scelso's
responsibility not. as a mandate to investigate but
rather to “coordinate traffic (code facilitation,
telegram or telegraphic consideration) for working
with the DDP with respect to what was being done over
the whole world..." (HSCA Classified Deposition of
R. Rocca, 7.17/78, p.. 9.)

Scelso ‘described in detail to the Committee’ the
manner in which he conducted the Agency's investiga-
tion:

«-spractically my whole Branch participated
in the thing. We dropped almost everything
else and I put a lot of my officers to work
in tracing names, analyzing files.
We were flooded with cable traffic, with
reports, suggestions, allegations from all

Scelso ‘stated during. his testimony that CIA“

During the latter half of December, Scelso :
issued a summary report which described Oswald's

(Executive Session Testimony of Richard Helms, 8/9/78,

(Ibid., pp.32-33,44,Executive Session of Testimony of

that during this phase primary interest in support of. the

on the assumption that a person who. spends

circumstances, had to be of specific interest

“The following exchange: between. Mr. Rocca and Committee

Mr. Goldsmith. Earlier, when I asked you which
areas of the case received emphasis, I believe. that. you
indicated that on balance the primary area of emphasis
was the Soviet connection.

Mr. Rocca... That was certainly the one that I would
say dominated -- looking at it from my point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-
Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA,- would
you have given more priority, more emphasis, to thé
possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Mr. Rocca. Again, I say that it would have
simply intensified. it, that there was attention given
to it, not particularly by the staff. I had no capabilities
on the. Cuban side.

operation in Mexico was something entirely entirely (sic)
within -~-it‘was an.enigma at the time.” They were just aie
getting started. This was WH's area. This was Win 07.
Seott's area of proficiency. So the defectors had only aia
begun to come out and they came out-later, the Cuban
defectors. I

So, I can't -- I really can't say that (a) the

“Cuban connection was ignored, because it wasn't. The

press was filled with it at the time.

The Harker interview should have been undoubté@¥ly »
given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it
was given specific attention, I was told at the time of
the Rockefeller thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. .In what way was. the Cuban. connection
investigated?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know. I don't know this.
That side of the report strikes me as being inadequate.

Mr. Rocca. That I can't answer... I certainly
didn't do it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Pardon me?

Mr. Rocca. We certainly didn't, in R&A.

Mr. Goldsmith. So, CI/R & A did not --

Mr. Rocca. Go into.the Cuban side of it at all.
This was something left to the people who were concerned
specifically with Cuban intelligence and security operation.

Mr. Goldsmith. . But I believé earlier we!
established that Mr. Helms gave orders that information
pertinent to the assassination was ‘to go through your

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. And once information pertinent

you or Mr. Helms would decide what information would

Mr. Rocca. Well, everything would go, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Therefore, you were in the
position, it would seem, to know what information was

Mr. Rocca. Questions went down to WH: do you

: As noted ahove, the CI Staff assumed responsibility :

in late December 1963 - early January 1964 for. the
coordination of CIA efforts to assist the Warren
Commission in its investigation. At that time, Raymond
Rocca, Chief of Research and Analysis for CI Staff,
was designated point of contact with the Warren
Commission. (HSCA Classified Deposition of James
Angleton, 10/5/78, p. 77.) Rocca's Research and
Analysis component was’ concerned with: A

"analytical intelligence, analytical —~

brainpower, which meant all source, “all

overt source comprehension; a study of

cases that had ceased to occupy opera~

tional significance, that is, closed cases,

to maintain the ongoing record of overall

quality and quantity of counterintelligence

component;... the Deputy Director for Plans

(HSCA Classified Deposition of R. Rocca,

of James Angleton, 10/5/78, p. 77.)

Mr. Rocca testified that assassination-related
information generated by CIA components was directed
to his staff (as designated point of contact with. the

Warren Commission) in the normal flow of. day to day

A, Opinions of Warren: Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The. Committee has contacted both representatives of
the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of
the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-
generated information to the Warren Commission. The
general ‘consensts of. these representatives is that. the
Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful
working relationship during the course of the. Commission's
investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,
p. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized
the CIA representativés with whom he dealt as
highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent. RB i»

(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,

(tbid. pe 24.) Mr. Rocca concluded that on.this basis::
"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information
bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance
to the Warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of.the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was

propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren
Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the
CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination AnAthe
astaplishmeacR of CApelicy vida cia tha Warren Commission,
(Ibid.,; p. 23.) le testified to the. Committee that the
CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to
Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard:
Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony
regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-
mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:
An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-
mission). We would attempt to ‘respond to it.
But these inquiries came in individual bits and’®- 6
pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we
could. (Ibid., pp. 10-11.) —

Mr. Helms: That is ‘correct.

(Ibid., p. 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren
Commission requests on a caseAbasis rather than uniformly
‘volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission
stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's perception
of the CIA's investigative résponsibility. Mr. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply ‘to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by thé

Approximately five hours after President

in Mexico City named "Luisa" received a telephone
call from an unidentified man speaking Spanish.

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic
comments do not merit serious attention. Her words
may indeed indicate foreknowledge of the assassina-
tion but may equally be interpreted without such a
sinister implication. Nevertheless, the Committee
has determined that Luisa Calderon's case should
have merited serious attention in the months following
the assassination.

In connection with the assassination, Luisa
Calderon's name first surfaced on November 27, 1964
in a cable sent by then Ambassador Mann to the State
Department (CIA Doc. DIR 85573, 11/27/63).

In that.cable Mann stated: »
“,..Washington should urgently consider
feasibility of requesting Mexican authorities
to arrest for interrogation: . Eusebio Azcue,
Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal. The two

men are Cuban national and Cuban consular

officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments
could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible
foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

20.0526

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,
Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

thel Agency's Cuban and Soviet{telephone
intercepts at might suggest foreknowledge

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This. involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether she :
had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

“Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."
The verb entere is mistranslated. Me enfere

(the first person of the verb enieratselie,

past tense) should be translated as -1 found
out (or I learned) about it -- the assassination7
almost. before Kennedy /did7." In other words,
Calderon was saying she -heard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding
Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderomp , +

comments as a suggestion on her part of possible

foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

Langosch paraphrased AMMUG's knowledge of Calderon

as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have-
had contact with Oswald because’ I learned
about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to Mexico, that she had been

involved with an American in Mexico. The
information to which I refer was told to

me by a DGI case officer... I had commented
to (him) that it seemed. strange. that Luisa
Calderon was receiving a salary from the

DGI although she apparently did not do

any work for the Service. (The case officer)
told me that hers was a peculiar case and
that he himself believed that she had been
recruited in. Mexico by the Central Intelligence
Agency although. Manuel Pineiro, the Head

of the DGI, did:not agree. As I recall,
(the case officer). had- investigated. Luisa
Calderon. This was because, during the time
she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted

a letter to her by an: American who signed
his name. OWER (phonétic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in

Spanish so I am not sure of how the name
mentioned by Hernandez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard" or something
different. As I understand the matter, 2
the letter from the American was a love )
letter but indicated that there was a
clandestine professional relationship
between the writer and Luisa~Calderon.

I also understand from (the case officer)
that after the interception of the letter
she had been followed and seen in. the
company of an American... Ido not know if
this could have been:.Oswald...(Ibid.)

The CIA. responded by memorandum:

."Although the (Mexico City) Station considered
the conversation of sufficient possible
interest to send a copy to headquarters,
the latter apparently did nothing with

it, for there appears to be no record in the

the May 8 memorandum written by Joseph Langosch

‘AMMUG-1 and a second Cuban Intelligence officer

believed Calderon to be a CIA operative. "(CIA Doc.

that this information was not provided the Warren

However, there are indications that such contact

A-September 1, 1963 CIA dispatch from the Chief
of the Special Affairs Staff to the CIA's Chief

of Station in Mexico City states in part:

++-Luisa Calderon has a sister residing
in Reynosa, Texas, married to an American
of Mexican descent. If (CIA asset) can
further identify the sister, our domestic

The Committee has queried David Ronis, the

that Calderon's sister be’ contacted by the CIA's
“domestic exploitation section." (HSCA Class.
Staff Interview of David Ronis, 8/31/78) Ronis’

at the time he wrote the dispatch. He worked
principally at CIA headquarters and was responsible
for recruitment and hanéling of agents for collection
of intelligence data. Mr. Ronis, when interviewed
by this Committee, stated that part of his responsi-

‘for operational leads related to the work of the:

normally would send requests to CIA field stations

he would receive no response to these requests,
which normally indicated that no follow-up had %

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-1's defection
and considered the possibility that he
might have some knowledge of the Oswald
case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions
to WH (Western Hemisphere) for. debriefing
AMMUG~1...WH desk records reflect that
AMMUG-1 was debriefed on 4 May 64 regarding
this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing
on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive
matter, it was dictated directly to a‘ CI
(Counterintelligence) stenographer on

5 May 1964. /Note: A-1 was debriefed on
several subjects on 4 May 64. ‘The procedure
was to assign each subject discussed a
debriefing number and they were written

up in contact report form by the WH case
officer. The instructions from CI staff
were to handle the Oswald case debriefing
very closely and not to keep any copies in
WH Division/. .The.."Oswald Case". was

logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing
report number 40, but the report itself

was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly
to a CI staff stenographer. There would

be no reason to include the number 40 on

the report of this special debriefing for

CI staff, since it was their only debriefing
report. We are'certain it is the debriefing
report (#40) because the date is the same;
it is the only debriefing report on Oswald ®
listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)
the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in
Oswald's 201 file.

In-a further effort to clarify the substance

was headed by Desmond FitzGerald and was responsible
for the ‘AMLASH operation (SSC, Book V, pp. 3, 8, 79)

Langosch, as the Chief of Counterintelligence
for the Special Affairs Staff, was responsible for
safeguarding SAS against penetration by foreign
intelligence services, particularly the Cuban
Intelligence Services (HSCA Classified Affidavit
of ‘Joseph Langosch, 9/14/78, p. 3). It was
Langosch's recollection that:

“i ‘eee the’ AMLASH operation prior to the

assassination of President: Kennedy was

characterized by the Special Affairs

staff, Desmond Fitzgerald (sic) and other

senior CIA officers as an assassination

operation initiated and sponsored by the
a CIA. (Ibid., p..4)

Langosch further recollected that as of 1962
it was highly possible that the Cuban Intelligence
Services were aware of AMLASH and his association
with the CIA and that the information upon which
he based his conclusion that the AMLASH
Operation was insecure was available to jeunes Berl Ge

*In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this °
Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit
executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who. "served.
as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the
entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs:
Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it
progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent L. Pollock,
executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically
contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation
was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond. -
FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an
assassination operation. In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions: ~ i f

g To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald
considered the AMLASH operation to be a political
action activity with the objective of organizing
a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the
Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. I heard
Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation
frequently, and never heard him characterize it as
an "assassi, ion operation." Mr. FitzGerald

d stated within my hearing on several occasions
his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

J loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH
operation as an “assassigftion operation"; the

case officer did not; I,~as Executive Officer, never
discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with
Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the otheg -
branch chiefs and the special assistants could not®
have so characterized it since they did not know
about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a
hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH
for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.)

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day
of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the .
pen with disdain. /Tbid., par. 4, p. 27), (Ibid.,

“it is the Committee's position that such informa—

might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-

complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin
commented before this Committee:
