3. A review of the circumstances surrounding MI.

Hunt's conversion to Contract Type A employment and

3

assignment was then undertaken by Messrs. Yale, Caufield,

Hudsoh and the undersigned.

The contract and payroll.

Files of Mi. Hunt were reviewed for possible indications

of the nature of the operational activity undertaken in

Madrid.

A review of travel vouchers indicated that Mr.

Hunt and his fanily made accountings indicating departure

from Washington, D. C.›

on 5 August 1965 with an arrival

in Madrid, Spain, On.16 August 1965. The costs of this

travel were charged to the budget of the Western Hami-

sphere Division, Deputy Directorate for Plans, L

Station Support account.. A subsequent accounting sum-

marized PCS travel expenses and included a payment for

apartment rental for 16, 17 and 18 August 1965 with

payment in the amount of $125 to Mr.

this purpose.

4.

It was determined that an allottee bank account

in Mr. Hunt's name had been established at the Riggs

National Bank of Washington. All salary and other non-

operational reimbursements were made to Mr. Hunt through

sterile check to this account.

An operational account

was established for Mr. Hunt with the. Chase Manhattan

Bank of New York City.

A review of all payments made to

Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account chrough Mr. Hunt's

operational advance subsidiary account, or 1442 account,

had been made.

There was no record of any operational

accounts or advances being processed through this channel.

Mr. Yale stated that this fact defined his concern.: He

felt that it was inconceivable that Mr. Hunt could have

undertaken operational activity without sone transfer of

or accounting for funds.

To date, no such records have

been developed.

No reference to a project of project

digraph or operational FAN number has been located. Al

expenses connected with Mr. Hunt identified to date were

charred to the

_Support.

A review made of

records has not indicated any "Developmental

and Target of Opportunity (DATO)" funds or "Other Opera-.

Activity (O0A)" funds expended by or on behalf of

Mr. Hunt-

These two accounts would normally be the source

of operational funding not charged against a specific pro-

ject activity.

5. A revior of all of tha travel vouchers on record

for Mr- Hunt during this period also failed to identify

a projects

In addition to the PCS and return vouchers,

two other accountings are on record.

One accounting

covered a trip by the entire Hunt family. to Paris "for

the renewal of visas." A second voucher covered a TDY

trip fron Madrid to Hashingion with return to Madrid

nada by MI. Hunt from 5 January to 8 January 1966. Tho

voucher states in the space providad for the citation of

the travel order number - "no travel order."

The account

ing was approved and signed by Mr. Thomas Karamessines,

then Baputy Director for Plans. No justification or

statement of purpose for this TDY was given on the account

Ing.

6. •Mr. Yale deterined that further raview of passible

sources or identification of operational funding was in

order.

HI. Yale gave instructions that the entire 1442

advance account of Mi. Hunt be reviewed for other possiblo

channels of funding outside of the New York Chase account-

Atter discussion, it was agreed that particular attention

be taken to any items connected with publishing or book

royalties. Mi. Yale noted that the royalty offset waiver

provision annended to Mr. Hunt's contract was, in his ex-

perience, somewhat unusual.

7.

MI. Yale was informed by the undersigned of the

intention to interview MI. Edward Ryan, currently Caief,

Division D, who was at the time of Mr. Hunt's Madrid assign-

sent, Deputy Chiaf of the Western Hemisphere Division.

MT -

Yale

suggested that Mr. Davis Poxell also be interviewed.

The undarsigned inforned Mi. Yale that this had been dono

and briefed MI. Yale on the generally negative rosulis of

tos intervion.

Mr.. Yale then rocormended that Hr. Sam

Halpeta be intergiewed.

Mr. Yale noted that Mr. Halpern

had been an assistant to Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald when the

latter was Chief, Western Hemisphere Division and had ac-

companied MI. Fitzgerald when he became Deputy Director for

Pla33,

Mr. Yale recalled that subsequent to Mr. Fizzgerald's

passing that Mr. Halper remained on the staff and acted as

an Executive Officer for Mr. Thomas Taramessings Mr. Yale

stated that from his experience, hi. Karamessines would

hays dolegatod all the arranzing of "details" surrounding

an assignment such as Mr. Hunt's to Mr. Halparn. 'N. Yale

offered the parenthetical observation of his surprise at

what be interpreted to be reticance to date to intervery

Ns, Halpoin.
