Because the man was not

unnoticed, the former agent
said. 7

The spy, he said, knew his

of whom was with him con-

“Someone slept in the same
bed with him. We even went
with him to the bathroom,”
he said.

After weeks of intense inter-

agreed te become a double

former agent's words:

FBI Bid to Kill Probe Charged

By Ronald Kessler
+ Washington Post Staff Writer

* Shortly after he became di-
‘rector of the FBI, Clarence M.
Kelley twice made unsuccess-
ful attempts to stop a Justice
‘Department investigation of;
an allegation that an FBI
‘agent had been bribed by a
‘member of the Mafia, accord-
ling to an informed source.
~The charge was leveled’
against New York FBI agent,
Joseph Stabile by two fellow;
New York agents. One said
Stabile had admitted to him
that he took the bribe.

An investigation was closed,
when it turned up no evidence}
against Stabile. But the two},
agents who made the accusa-}
tion told the Justice Depart-
ment’s orgainized crime strike
force in Brooklyn that the FBI
investigation had been
“cover-up,” the source said.
This triggered a Justice De-
{partment investigation, which
Hs continuing, the source said.
Despite the origin of the}
‘Justice Department investiga-
‘tion, the souree said, Keliey
-asked high-ranking depart-
ment officials in 1973 to call
the Brooklyn prosecutors off
the case on the grounds the

,FBI had found no violations of}

Taw.
- In addition, the source said,’
‘Kelley complained that the
Justice investigation was hurt-
ing FBI morale. i

Bur

The informed source said;
Kelley's requests, which were:
known to only a few FBI and
department officials amounted|
to “pressure” and an “at-
tempt to suppress it [the in-
vestigation].”

‘The FBI, the former prose-|
eutors said, is a fact-finding
agency that normally docs not
express opinions on whether
an investigation started by
‘Justice should be continued.

Another former _iederal
prosecutor said the FBI, on|
rare occasions, has expressed
such an opinion based on man-
power considerations, But FBI
intervention when it is a tar:
get of the investigation would
be'“improper,” the former Jus-
tice Department official said.

Sourees familiar with. the
bribe allegation attribuated
Kelley's action to a fecling
long held by FBI leaders that,
any hint of corruption would
irreparably damage the bu-
reau’s image and cffective-
ness,

Although Kelley's attempts
were unsuccessful, the Justice
investigation had been ham-

‘ation

pered by the FBUs handling of
the case before Kelley became
director in July, 1973, one
source said. i

Chief among these problems:
— which were confirmed by a!
second souree — was the fact,
that the FBI immediately con-
fronted Stabile with the bribe
allegation ‘before attempting
to gather evidence against.
him. i

In doing so, the source said,
the FBI agent gave the agent’
treatment it would not give
others suspected of criminal
behavior.

In addition, the source said,
at that same time the FBI vio-|
lated its own procedures by
failing to inform the Justice
Department that it was con-
ducting an investigation of the
bribe allegation. :

An FBI spokesman said Kel-
ley cannot comment on the
bribe allegation because many
of the same issues will be
raised in a Brooklyn perjury

trial scheduled to begin April
id. u

Dear Mike:

Ifwould appreciate your supplying to the Committee
all mdémoranda and other materials pertaining to the
establishment of the Office of Legal Counsel in the FBI
in 1971 as well as all materials prior to that date which
would reflect earlier Bureau practices and procedures for
considering the legal and constitutional implications

of major policy changes in FBI Domestic Intelligence
Division operations. (This should include, of course,
materials which pertain to the responsibilities and
duties of the Office of Legal Counsel which formerly

was located in the Training Division.)

I would also appreciate your forwarding such materials
7 as would reflect the process by which Section 87 of the
pm FBI Manual of Instructions was changed in 1973 (i.e., from
\p { inception through final approval).
; a
nye a Your continued cooperation is appreciated.

RB puss, Ay a yy?

The following concerns an interview on Hovember 18,
1975, of former SAC Roy K. Moore of the FBI by an SSC State—

Moore's report of the results of the interview
follows:

“Yeday, November 18, 1975, at the request of
Mr. Robert Kelley, Church Committee, Room 6303, Dizksen
Building, First and C Streets, I appeared at their office
and furnished an affidavit im reply to that of Mr. Hardy,
the alleged informant in the Camden 28 case.

“According to Mr. Kelley, the Committee is looking
into the use of infexmants by the FBI and other intelligence
agencies.

‘
v

«

involving him in a violation of the law. He was interviewed
by Supervisor Bill Anderson of the Philadelphia “ffice whe
happened to be in the Resident Agency at that time.

‘Ultimately, Mr. Anderson convinced Mr. Hardy
that he should assist. his Government and report on the
activities of those individuals who were planning the break-in
. of the Federal Building.

. “Over a period of time, Hardy assisted those who
had already been working on the surveillance of the building
and planning the break-in and was able to furnish Agents the
names of those involved, their plans, and was successful in
helping effect their arrest when the break-in occurred.

‘The interviews with Me. Hardy were recorded on - O
tape. They were played back to the agents.on the ‘Special,‘
and in many instances it is a matter of record that Mr. Hardy
was cautioned by the Agents handling him not to become a

‘provocateur.’ Upon the arrest of the 28 individuals who
breke inte the Federal Building, Mr. Hardy was e willing
Govermment witness. However, subsequent thereto one of
his children fell from a tree and was impaled on an iron post
and later died as a result, It is our understanding that his
religious advisers convinced him that this was retribution
for turning against his fellow conspirators and assisting.
the Government. He ultimately testified for the defendants
rather than the Government.

"In my affidavit, I explained that the Camden 28
ease was one of 58 break-ins involving Selective Service
Boards and Federal Buildings and that, as a result of latent
prints developed {n the various break-ins and the printing (finger)
of the defendants in the hase 28 case, we were able to

make comparisons and solve 16 of the unsolved break-ins,
thus showing that the Camden 28 case was part of a larger
conspizacy than that one incident.

“Additionally, the question was asked why we

” didn't make the arrest upon the breaking of the window of

the Federal Building in Camden or even before on the basis
ef conspiracy rather than letting them consummate the crime
of breaking, entering and carrying away the files. It was
explained that this matter was closely followed with
Departmental attorneys and the Assistant U. S, Attorney,
New Jersey, to insure that they were satisfied that the
elements of the Crime on Government Reservation Statutes
had been satisfied. The departmental attorneys were

Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Cubbage. It was further explained that
the Berrigan case had just occurred and that their defense
was that, while they had talked about kidnapping Mr. Kissinger,
they never really intended to do it and obviously the
Departmental attorneys and Assistent U. S. Attorney wanted
to insure that there was oo question as te the intention of
these individuals, However, the best information could be
obtained from-these attorneys as to the reasons for their
decisions.

“The latter part of the depasition dealt with ny
pergonal opinion of the use of informants tn intelligence
investigations. %bvinusly, I endeavored to justify the
use of informants as being far superiox to investigative
operations for the true intent of the persons comprising
any group who have as a purpese destruction of the establishment
or overthrow of the Government."

NOTE: :
Mr. Moore telephonically dictated the results of
the interview to a Bureau stenographer on 11/18/75.

This memorandum effects delivery of material
relating to Items 5 and 6 of the Novonwber 21 SSC request,
and completes our response to requests of the SSC in this
letter.

An exact copy of documents being delivered to the
ssc is being retained in the Senstudy 75 Project.

With respect to the March, 1965, authorization
for microphone surveillance on Bernard Lee, we have
been unable to locate any document in the King or Lee
files relating to the purpose of a surveillance on Lee.
We believe (as noted in the January, 1965, surveillance
authorization material) that the surveillance was directed
at King, and any room in which King was likely to meet
with associates. We have not located information indicating
Lee was a primary target of surveillance,

RE: REQUEST PERPAINING TO AUTHORIZATION
AND PURPOSE OF BLECTRONIC SURVEILEANCES
_ CONDUCTED BY THE FBI

: with respect to Item 6, our records indicate a.
microphone surveillance was authorized on two rooms at
‘the Sheraton Park Hotel, New York City, where
Martin L. King, Jr., and Bernard Lee, an associate,
were to reside during the period March 29 to March 31, 1965,
Neither King nor Lee occupied those rooms during this
period, having registered at a different location in
Bew York. City. PeEEE : ie

: Although the surveillance was authorized on

a room which Lee was to cccupy, it was not directed at
Lee personally, but instituted to provide full coverage

‘ of King's activities while at the Sheraton Park fotel..
In that regard, we have included material showing
surveillance coverage of King on an earlier date in
January, 1965. We helieve this surveillance activity
shows the intent of the surveillance authorized in
March, 1965; namely, to provide full coverage to areas
likely to be used by King and his associates for meetings.

New York called today and advised that King, Bétnaka Lee,
and Andrew Young/registered at the Park Sheraton Hotel and were
.assdigned Room 2541 and 2543. SAC {Roney yfadvised that the New York
Office had for monitoring purposes the availability of Rooms 2439
and 2441,

In view of the nature of the discussion which King was
scheduied to have in New York with] Clarence Jones and Harry Waehtel.]
.it was felt the results of the discussion would contain considerabié
intelligence information. New York said that through other informa-
tion which they have developed, it appears the meeting will actually
be held in[Wacntes'sfoffice, but New York still strongly recommended
use of microphone coverage in the_rooms ogcupied by King's party
as the results of the meeting in ffachtel'sJoffice would later be
{discussed in the hotei rooms.

In view of King's continued contact with(Clarouce Jones,
who is King's conduit for contact with communist/ Stanley Levison
land: in view of other activities of King,jit is considered highly
lesirable that New York place microphoné coverage on these rooms
if this can be done with full security. [Roneyassured me full
security would be availablejand that the indiViduals involved will be
under physical surveillance 50 the microphone installation could be
made during the conference in Wachtel's office.} New York contemplated
use of two Wasp instruments,which would not irivolve running wires out
of the rooms and which instruments can be installed with full security.

ACTION:
fu Under the circumstances, I authorized New York to go ahead
-| with the installation provided it could be done with full security.

By memorandum 1/2/76, you were advised that Dr. Joseph
William Magee had been contacted by a representative of captioned
Committee and requested to make himself available for interview
by that Committee. Dr. Magee was not advised of the topic of
interview and it was recommended that the Committee be contacted -
and the topic of interview be ascertained and Dr. Magee be ap-

| propriately advised of the topic.

Michael Epstein, Staff Member of captioned Committee,
advised on 1/2/76 that the topic of interview by that Committee
would be Laboratory procedures and practices and, in general,

from FRINO, authorizing this action. (Copies attached.)
Additionally, Ur. Ecibert advised that at the coneclusien
of the kooring on Fonda, 12/15/75, Fonda's attorney fur~
nished him a copy of 2 letter dated 12/ 8/75, fron an
SSC stafé renber, which ietter had as onelocures, tho
aforonentioned Cointcipro documents relating to Fonda.
(Copy attached.)

in veviewing Hoadquartera’ files relating .to the
Buresu's Counterintellisence Prorran, it is noted that
pursuant to a request of the SSC, regarding Cointelpro
vetivities, a nunber of documents wore furnished on
9/0/75, to on SEC stefF nember, which included the above-
deseribed Cointelpro docurents.

OBSERVATIONS:

A review of the "Rules of Procedure" for the SEC,
on page 5, tha following statenent, in part, is set forth:
"No other materinia received by the gtal? or its con.

public, in whole ox in part or by way of summary, or disclosed
te any person outsido the Commities unless awthorized by 2
majority vote of the exutire Comltiec,"

Tt is noted it was specifically stated in the ss¢
staff nenber*s letter to Fonda's attorney dated 12/ 8/75,
that the release of the Cointelpro docunents in question,
were in fact, released by the Committee, Thus, it would
appear the furnishing ef the documents to Ponda were within
the puidelinen of the Comultteo and such docunents vere
not tecked.

RECOMMENDATION ;

None. Tor information only.

ADDENDUM LEGAL COUNSEL DIVISION  PvD:lad 12/30/75

While on a informal basis the Senate Select Committee
has been hotifying the Bureau prior to release of Bureau documents
outside the Committee, there is no written agreement that they

i. will do so. In this instance, Legal Counsel Division understands
that the Bureau in responding to a motion for discovery in the
Fonda law suit stated that Jane Fonda was not the target of a
COINTELPRO activity. ‘This statement was based on a review of the
main file pertaining to Fonda and Bureau indices. The Senate
Select Committee subséguently determined, in fact, she was the
target of COINTELPRO and furnished copies ef those documents to
Fonda's attorney. We recommend that no protest be made to the
Committee. Departmental Attorney Seibert is aware that we failed
to locate and furnish two documents germaine to the motion for
discovery and corrective action concerning this matter is being
taken. 7

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY

Telephone Rm. —

DECEMBER 11, 1975 Director Sec'y

Attached is a draft of the Attorney General's testimony to be
given before the Church Committee on December 11, 1975. The draft
was forwarded to me by Jack Fuller of the Attorney General's office today
with a request for comments. I furnished a copy of the draft to Mr. Adams
and to Mr. Wannall and I reviewed a copy. After consulting with Mr. Adams
and Mr. Wannall, I called Jack Fuller and advised him that we would
recommend the following changes:

On page 8, first full paragraph following line 7, we recommend
the addition of 'The Director promptly responded to my request."

On page 12, first fill paragraph, we recommend the addition
of the following sentence after the first sentence of the paragraph:
"However, today the FBI continues its long-established practice of
submitting investigative results in such matters to the Criminal
Division. "

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED:

On page 12, first full paragraph, the last sentence states the
standard to be followed in domestic security investigations. I recommended
to Fuller that the standard seeking to require a ‘conclusion that the
individual is engaged in certain activities" be modified to require only
that there be a "reasonable suspicion that the individual is engaged in
such activities. '' Fuller told me that the Attorney General had changed
the language from "conclusion" so that the sentence would read: "The
standard would be that there must be specific and articulable facts giving j-
reason to believe that the individual or group under investigation is i

engaged in the activities I have just listed." I pointed out to Fuller that

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

the standard expressed in that sentence is equivalent to the probable
cause requirement for an arrest and that if we had that information the
FBI would be authorized to proceed to make an immediate arrest instead
of merely to conduct an investigation. Mr. Fuller said he understood
that problem, but that the Attorney General had directed the standard

to be "reason: 2.2 to believe."

I then asked Mr. Fuller if he would be willing to modify the
sentence so that the standard would include information that the
individual is engaged "or may be engaged" in the activities. He said that
possibility had been discussed specifically with the Attorney General
and the Attorney General declined to modify the standard in that way.
Therefore, the Attorney General will state tomorrow that the standard

will be "reason to believe."

ALL FEI FoR

Docld: 32989562 Page 47

The Committee has asked me to talk with you
today about the future of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
I thought it might be helpful if I outline quite briefly
some of the points I would like to make, some of the
problems I think ought to be considered, and some of the
steps we have taken.

The first point-is that the statutory base
for .the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully
satisfactory. The basic statutory provision is 28 USCA
533 which provides that the Attorney ‘General may appoint
officials "(1) to detect and prosecute crimes against the
United States; (2) to assist in the protection of the’
President; and (3) to conduct such investigations regarding
official matters under the control of the Department. of
Justice and the Department of State as may be directed by
the Attorney General.". There are other statutes, such
as the Congressional Assassination, Kidnapping and Assault
Act, which vest in the Bureau special responsibilities to
investigate criminal violations. In addition, there are
Executive orders and Presidential statements or directives
which place investigatory responsibilities upon the Bureau.

A number of questions are often asked about this
statutory base. It has the virtue of simplicity, but the
Executive orders which deal with government employee

investigations are complicated and confusing, and Presidential

eos YD BGS" JBI



-2-
“memoranda, or, perhaps, oral instructions from a President,
may be difficult to collate. I think it is important,
in any case, to separate out the kinds of questions which
are asked about the Bureau's authority base. Some questions
are constitutional in nature, relating to the inherent power
of the President; others go to’ the interpretation of the
statutes and the relationship between the statutes and
Presidential directives; others go to the failure of the
statutes to define sufficiently the areas of the Bureau's
jurisdiction or to spell out sufficiently--and this is :
partly constitutional+-the means and methods which the Bureau
is permitted to use in carrying out its assigned tasks.

The second point, related to the first, isa
continuing discussion of the role of the Bureau in intelligence
investigations or domestic security investigations. The
argument is sometimes made that the Bureau's proper role,
at least in purely domestic. matters, shoulda be limited to
investigations of committed crimes. The basic statute for
the Bureau is broader than this, as have been Executive
orders and Presidential mandates. to the Bureau. The basic
statute is broader, since it refers to investigations
regarding official Matters under the control of the Department
of Justice and the Department of State as may be directed ;
‘by the Attorney General. A disparity is sometimes seen
among the different roles of the Bureau in crime detection,
in on-going domestic security matters, and in foreign

“intelligence or foreign counterintelligence matters. In

NW 55114 Docld:32989562 Page 48



ae r) oe @
recent days a statement by the then attorney General Harlan
‘Fiske Stone, who established the Bureau an@ chose J. Edgar
Hoover as its director, has been quoted as a relevant
warning.

Stone warned "There is always the possibility
that a secret police may become a menace to free government
and free institutions, because it carries with it the
possibility of abuses of. power which are not always quickly
apprehended or understood .... . It is important that its
activities be strictly limited to the performance of those

] functions ‘for which it was created and that its agents
themselves be not above the law or beyond its reach Pras

The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned ‘with political

or other opinions of individuals. It.is concerned only
with their conduct and then only with such conduct as is

forbidden by the laws of the United States. When a police

system passes beyond these limits, it is dangerous to the

proper administration of justice and to human liberty, which

it should be our first concern to cherish."

I should like to suggest that Stonds: warning always”
must be considerea rélevant to the proper conduct of the
Bureau's duties, but it does not necessarily follow that

domestic security investigations are, therefore, outside

the Bureau's proper functions. The detection of crime in

some areas requires preparation and at least some knowledge

‘of what is likely to be going on. What is at issue, I think, -

NW 55114 DocId:32989562 Page 49



is the proper scope, the means and methods used, the attention
paid to conduct and not views, and the closeness of the
relationship of the conduct and that which is forbidden by
the laws of the United States.
Third, I realize that some proposals, since I

was asked about this when I last appeared before this
Committee, might separate out in some fashion domestic and

- foreign intelligence functions from the FEI or’ from one
another within the FBI. This is, of course, an issue to
be looked at. I assume it is recognized that there may
be some relationship between ‘that intelligence which is-
domestic and. that intelligence which is involved in foreign -
counterintelligence work. One may lead to the other...
And there may be a relationship between foreign counter-
intelligence and foreign intelligence. If the work’ were
separated out into different agencies, I do not know if
the ‘decision about when an investigation should pass
from one agency to another always could be made easily.
Moreover, even so, information presumably would pass from:
oné agency to the other. I know that one consideration
has been that it might be decided that information collected
by some permitted. means in intelligence investigations
under some. circumstances should not be used in criminal
prosecutions. But if there is an exchange of information,
this must always be a consideration, whether there are

separate agencies or not, and the basic question then is one

HW 55114 DocId:32989562 Page 50



teint td

5 of use and not organization. The more active concern,
I believe, is that there is a risk that conduct proper for
one area may be improper for another, and that the combination
can work a contamination. My view on this is that in any
case we must decide what conduct is appropriate and is.
! inappropriate .for each of the areas, and we must take
steps to make sure that conduct is lived up to. My hope
is that the fact that the FBI has criminal investigative
| responsibilities,which must be conducted within the confines
of constitutional protections strictly enforced by the courts,
gives the organization an awareness of .the interests of

individual liberties that might be missing in an agency

[ devoted solely to intelligence work. I know the argument

can be run the other-way. I believe the dangers are greater

if there is separation.

NW 55114 DocId:32989562 Page 51



e | e
Fourth, there is a question as to the proper role of
the FBI in crime prevention and whether or not it should be
considered authorized to take steps under some circumstances
to reduce the likelihood that crimes will be committed

or that serious injury to persons or property will occur.

’ Preventive action has raised serious questions and these

must be dealt with. But I suppose an initial question is
whether it should be allowed at all. Yet I believe undex
special circumstances and with proper controls most would
believe this to be a proper function, ;

Fifth, the problem of proper controls, supervision and
accountability ‘is all-embracing. By statute the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is in the Department of Justice,
and also by statute-the Attorney General is. the head of the
Department of Justice. The history is mixed, of course, and

we all have a tendency to over simplify, but it is a fair

. statement that there have been times -in the past when the

supervision by Attorneys General, granted that the Bureau must
have considerable autonomy, has been sporadic, practically
nonexistent, or ineffective. I hope that is not the case now.
The responsibility is a heavy one. But in any event the prob+
lem of proper controls, supervision and accountability goes
beyond the Director of the Bureau and the Attorney General,

I have already mentioned that in my view the statutory base for

the operations of the Bureau cannot be said to be fully satis-

factory. I think that better controls and performance can
be achieved through statutory means, executive orders, guide-

lines, and reporting to appropriate congressional committeés.

HW 55114 Doclda:32989562 Page 52



_ NW

-+  -Sixth, before ge come to a resume of ae the steps -

.which have been taken, let me say I know we all realize that

in the past there have been grave abusés. T am uncomfortable
with a kind of writing of history, however, which sees it only
in terms of the abuses and not in terms of past and présent

stretigth. It is very difficult to be fair to the past in which

‘many institutions of government carried a share of responsibility.

But more than unfairness is involved, If we are not careful, |
we will turn to solutions of the moment which a better reading
of history might indicate are not the best solutions. I know
we must seize the moment if I may use such a phrase in this
setting. I know also that this Committee realizes that avery

important agency with dedicated, highly. professional, greatly

- disciplined government servants is involved. The importante

is to the security and ‘domestic tranquility of the United States.

Stone's warning was given in an act of creation, He was proud

. Of his creation. In spite of the abuses, there is a proper

place for pride. I take it our mutual work should be to nurture
that pride and the conditions which justify it.

I turn now to a review of some of the steps which have been

safeguards to protect the, privacy of individuals and with -_
awareness of the unfairness of instant history to give a
great deal of information to Congressional committees. Attorney

became Attorney 7 these were eee, hee of my first
“acts ‘as Attorney General, my third week in office, was to testify
before a Congressional committee about possible incidents of
‘political misuse of the PBI by the White House in the past
and about the nature of FBI file-keeping systems, particularly
_the files kept by Director Hoover in his office suite. Director
Kelley has spoken. publicly and before congressional committees
.about incidents in the past in which FBI agents engages in
break-ins to gather or photograph pyhsical evidence in intelli-
gence investigations. On a number of occasions, most recently in
testimony before this Committee, I have described the history
of the use of electronic surveillance by the FBI. We have
welcomed such opportunities. i

On February 26, 1975, I directed Director Kelley to :

‘report to me any requests made of the Bureau or practices within
the Bureau which he deems improper or which present the appear-
ance of impropriety. On February 28, 1975, Director Kelley
ordered FBI personnel to report such requests or practices to
him. In July 1975 I reaffirmed my February directive and also

have to be selective. I make this point, which I think may
sound disconcerting, not in any way to minimize the respon~
sibility of the Bureau to keep the Department informed. nor

to minimize the Department's duty to find out. Rather

I want to be realistic about a learning and organization

problem which requires realism if it is to be understood

and perfected. ;

With respect to possible legislation, the Department

has in preparation various drafts of possible bills which may
‘be of assistance in the area of what is now warrentless
‘electronic surveillance.’ Although cbtaining a judicial warrant
. does not automatically eradicate the possibility of abuse,

it is perceived to “be an important safeguard of individual
-privacy interests, and we are exploring, as we said we would

do, various possibilities and alternatives.

Finally, a committee within the Department of Justice--

chaired by Mary Lawton; Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the
Office of Legal Counsel and composed of representatives of my
office (Jack Fuller), the Criminal and Civil Rights Division
. (Phil White, Walter Barnett), the Office of Policy and Planning
(Alan Kornblum) and the FBI (John Hotis)~-has been working for
eight months reviewing FBI procedures in many areas and drafting
guidelines to govern those procedures in the future. The Committee
has produced draft guidelines covering White House inquiries,
Congressional and Judicial staff appointment investigations, un-
‘solicited mail, and domestic security investigations. It is
currently at work on guidelines covering counterespidnage:. in-
vestigations and will later. consider the use of informants, the
‘employee loyalty program, organized crime intelligence investiga-~ -
tions, criminal investigations, and other aspects of FBI practice.
The Committee's work has been extensive and time-consuming. ~It

has involved not only questions of proper safeguards but also of

efficiency in the proper functioning of the Bureau. It has

been an effort to translate into words the complicated and

| important mechanisms for controlling the FBI. I hope the
Committee's efforts at articulation will be of use to this Com-
mittee and others as it considers drafting legislation.

You have received copies of the latest drafts of the
guidelines that have been substantially completed by the Committee.

These guidelines do not yet represent Department policy. There:

isagreement within tha Department on some aspects of these

lines. I have disagreed with the Committee recommendations

-about—other-recommendations--particularlywith-respect to the
treatment of-usolicited mail. Some of the proposals in the
guidelines could be promulgated as departmental regulations
Congress-may feel some ought to be enacted into statutory law.
Other ‘provisions would require implementation by executive order.

, I would ‘be glad to discuss these draft guidelines with
you in detail in response to your questions, but a brief discussion
of the guidelines on domestic security may be useful at the outset.

The guidelines begin by attempting to impose some order
and definiteness to the domestic security field. To begin
with, these guidelines. do not deal with FBL efforts to counter-
act the work of foreign intelligence services operating within
the United States. Standards for determining when there is
foreign involvement sufficient to place a subject in the category .
of foreign counterintelligence investigation are now being debated
within the guidelines committee. The domestic security guidelines
also are not meant to. cover security or Lackground investigations
of federal appointees or investigations of ordinary crimes. ‘Under
‘the draft guidelines domestic security investigations are only
to be authorized when there is a likelihood that the activities
of individuals or groups involve or will involve the use of force
or violence in violation of federal law. Domestic security inves-
tigations are to be limited to activities of individuals or groups
intended to accomplish one of five purposes: overthrowing the
government of the United States or of a State; interfering with

the activities within the United States of foreign governments

or their representatives; influencing government policies by

interfering by force or violence with government functions or

interstate commerce; depriving individuals of.their civil rights;
-and creating domestic violence or rioting when such violence

or rioting would necessitate as a countermeasure the use of

federal armed forces. There is also a provision for limited

‘investigation when there is a clear and immediate threat of domestic *
violence which is likely to result in a request by a state for fed-

-eral armed assistance. : - : y

| : Anther feature of the draft guidelines is to place

strict controls upon the use of any technique by the FBI which
goes beyond the gathering of information. COINTELPRO was the
name given the use of some such techniques. As I have said
before, some of the activities in COINTELPRO were outrageous

and the others were foolish. Nonetheless, there may be circum-

NW 55114 DocId:32989562 Page 58



stances involving an immediate risk to human life or to extraordin=
arily important government functions that could only be
countered by some sort of preventive action. The guidelines
require that any such preventive action proposal be submitted
to the Attorney General. He could authorize the preventive
action only when there is probable cause to believe that the
violence is imminent and when such measures are necessary to.
minimize the danger to life or property. The preventive action
would in all cases have to be nonviolent. The Attorney General
would be v4uired to ‘report to Congress periodically and no less
often than once a year onthe usé of preventive action by the
FBI.

I make no claim that during this. rather difficult but
interesting and--I must trust--promising period, that we have
achieved all that might have been possible. In many ways-the
work has been-disappointingly slow. But I do think we have
made advances in nurturing and helping to improve a structure
which will be supportive of the best efforts of the ‘men and
women in the Department of Justice and in the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. No procedures are fail-safe against abuse.

The best protection remains the quality and professionalism of

the member of the Bureau and of the Department.

SHUATE SELECT COMMIZLEG A INTELLIGINCE ACTIVITIES (ssc)

A review of FBI files for infermation relating to
drugs designed tn modify behavior indicates an interest
dating back to 1922. Hewever, this interest has not extended
to the pnint where the FBI has conducted research on behavior-
siedifying drugs ner has it funded such research. Ve have
maintained liaison vith ather U, 5, Government agencies and
industrial organizations in order to be aware ef developments
in this area. However, we have not implemented any programs
to apply the results «f research ennducted by such erganizations.

4 single instance vas found in which ‘truth serun'
vas administered in an FBI imvestigation, ‘that investigatien
involved en individual publicly identified as “Ignacy Sanucl
\itezak . . . a ‘super spy' for the fussians," who left the
United States in Nevember, 1945, In that investigation,
an associate of "iMtezak" vas interviewed by FBI persennel
during March, 1947. During the initial interview, he
atritted having been reerulted by “Witezak te secure infor-
mation for “Witegek.' the assaciate told the interviciring
égents that he did not vant tn hold anything back and
requested that he be given some sedium anytal Cenmmonly
referred to as “truth serum"). In spril, 1947, the associate
vas reinterviewed, follewing the administration of sodiun

that his action was entirely voluntary. ‘the use of sodium

attention of FBI Headquarters, it resuited in the issuance
of a letter dated July 3, 1947, to all Special Agents in

tolerate any experiments er participation nn the part nf its

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Item 5 requested the July 16, 1964, memorandum from-
Mr. Baumgardner to Mr. Sullivan which is referred to ia
handwriting at the bottom of the second page of the July 15,
1964, memorandum from Baumgardner to Sullivan captioned
"Communist Party, USA, Negro Question, Communist Influence in
Racial Matters; Internal Security - Commmist."

Being delivered herewith are copies of a Baumgardner
to Sullivan memorandum dated July 17, 1964, and a letter to
the Honorable Walter W. Jenkins Special Assistant to the
President, also dated July 17, 1964, which it would appear are
responsive to the $S8C's request, noting that the July 15,
1964, memorandum from Baumgardner to Sullivan concerned the
furnishing of Information obtained through electronic surveil-
lance of King to tir, Jenkins. It would appear the notation
in ceference to a July 16, 1964, memorandum appearing on the
July 15, 1964, memorandum is erroneous. A copy of the men
orandum enclosed with the letter to Mr. Jenkins is not boing
furnished the SSC inasmuch as information contained therein
is the product of electronic surveillance of King.

In accordance with requests set forth in Items 6a,
7a and 8a in referenced 550 letter, the original and enclosures
of the March 29, 1968, memorandum of G, C. Noore to WW. CG.
Sullivan captioned "Counterintelligence Program, Black
Nationalist-Hate Groups, ttacial Intelligence (Martin Luther
King)3" the March 26, 1968, memorandum of G. C. Moore to
Me. W. C. Sullivan "Counterintelligence Program, Black
Nationalist-Hate Groups, Racial Intelligence (Washington
Spring Project)" and the March 28, 1968, memorandum of
G. CG. Moore to Mr. W. C. Sullivan captioned "Sanitation
Workers Strike, Memphis, Tennessce; Racial Matters," are
availavie for review by a representative of the 5SC in room
4171 of the J, Edgar Hoover Building.

With cespect to Items 6b, 7b and 8b, a logical search
of Bureau records failed to disclose the existence of any
"tickler" or any other copies of the above-mentioned memoranda.

Materials cequested in Items 6d, 7d and 8d are also

available for review by a representative of the SSC in room
4171 of the J. Edgar Hoover Building,

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

With respect to Item 9, a search of logical Bureau
records failed to locate any newspaper clippings or magazine
articles pertinent to the memorandum mentioned above.

—

Item 6c as set forth in referenced SSC letter is

not being responded to in this memorandum. This request,

per conversation between Special Agent Seymor F. Phillips

and Michael Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination of the Department of Justice on December 3, 1975,
has been restated in a separate SSC letter dated December 4,
1975, and will be responded to separately.

With regard to excisions in materials being delivered
herewith, where no notation appears as to reason for axcision,
the excision was made for the reason that the information
actually summarizes or quotes from conversations monitored
during electronic surveillances of King, In some cases, it
can be ascertained precisely what information in FBI files
came from electronic surveillances of Dr. King; however,
there exist areas where documentation of the information is
mot precise and no accurate determination can be made. ‘There-
fore, no assurances can be given that portions of the material
being furnished do not contain information developed as a
cesult of electronic surveillances of King.

NOTE:

SSC letter of November 21 requested material per-
taining to 30 telephone and 9 microphone surveillances with
respect to authorizations and purpose of the coverage. The
SSC requested the material for November 28; however, the
extent of research and preparation necessary to comply with
this request rule out our meeting this deadline. Mr. Steven
Blackhurst of the Department was consulted on this problem
on November 28. On December 1, Mr. John ELLif£, Director,
Domestic Intelligence Task Force, SSC, advised Supervisor
Elmer W. Larson, Jr., that, for the present, the requests
made on the November 21 letter would be confined to Items 1
and 22. Response to the remaining questions will be negotiated

The subject is the editor of the newsletter, "The Herald

and uses his newsletter to expose people and organizations he
considers communist and subversive.

Capell is known to be in possession of information
classified up to and including "Secret," some of which originated
with this. Bureau and some with the Central intelligence Agency.

He has refused to furnish his source for this information, Capell
has published some of this classified information in ccepies of

his newsletter and he has advised this Bureau that he plans to
publish a book which will contain additional classified information.
It appears that the subject*s source is a United States Gov me. 5
employee having access to the classified information and his action i:
in furnishing Capell this classified information, plus Capell's.
publishing it, constitutesa danger to the internal security of the-
United States. In at least one instance there is a danger of a < ~~”
most sensitive source of this Bureau being compromised. If the
identity of Capell's source can be learned, we may eliminate

this security threat.

Reference is made to my memorandum dated April 19,

surveillance on the residence of the subject located at School
House Road, Somerset County, Zarephath, New Jersey, for the
purpose of ascertaining the subject's sources for.the

"The Herald of Freedom."

Our coverage on the subject has revealed that he is
in almost daily contact with Robert E. Manuel, an attorney who
resides in Alexandria, Virginia, and who is in the law firm
of Johnson (Wayne G.) and Manuel in Fairfax, Virginia. Manuel
has claimed to have "a network" of people furnishing him
information which he in turn gives to Capell. It is apparent
that Manuel is Capell's intermediary and he undoubtedly has
contacts at the Department of State and the Washington, D.C.,
Metropolitan Police Departmen’. ‘rom whom he is cece ad

Yeeee MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENER
: RE: JACK LEVINE

Jack Levine resides at 203 West 90th Street,
New York 24, New York. He is a former Special Agent of
the FBI, serving from September 12, 1860, to August 4,
1961. Since he left the FBI, he has engaged in a
vindictive and irrational attack upon this agency and
its operations.

In the October 20, 1962, issue of "The Nation"
magazine, Levine wrote an article entitled 'Hoover and the
Red Scare," in which he has disclosed highly class ed
information relaving to the operations of this Bureau. There
-is every indication that he intends to continue disclosing
sensitive information. For example, Levine appeared on
New York Radio Station WBAI on the evening of October is,
1962, at which time he disclosed information of a confi
dential nature concerning investigations conducted by this
Burcau. The Commmist Party is already aware of Levine's
actions and it believed that members of this Party
be in contact with him, if they have not already done s
further, it is likely that representatives of us
nations will be in contact with him seeking information.
Levine has knowledge of some of this agency's most valuable
: informants, If he disclosed them, he could do this country's
' national defense irreparable harm.
|

: In order to adequately protect the security of

a this country, it is requested that authority be granted to
place a technical surveillance at his current residence or
at any future address to which he may move.

The subject is the editor of the newsletter, "The Herald
of Freedom," He is an extremist in his attitude toward communism
and uses his newsletter to expose people and organizations he
considers communist and subversive.

Capell is known to be in possession of information
classified up to and including "Secret," some of which originated
with this Bureau and some with the Central Intelligence Agency.

He has refused to furnish his source for this information, Capelli ,
has published some of this classified information in copies of fy
his newsletter and he has advised this Bureau that he plans to !
publish a book which will contain additional classified information.
It appears that the subject's source is a United States Government
employee having access to the classified information and his action
in furnishing Capell this classified information, plus Capell's
publishing it, constitutesa danger to the internal security of the -
United States, In at least one instance there is a danger of a ~
most sensitive source of this Bureau being compromised, If the
identity of Capelits source can be learned, we may eliminate

this security threat.

RE: FRANK A. CAPELL
ESPIONAGE - X

Reference is made to my memorandum dated April 19,
1965, on which you indicated authorization for a technical
surveillance on the residence of the subject located at School
House Road, Somerset County, Zarephath, New Jersey, for the
purpose of ascertaining the subject!s sources for the
classified information he has published in his newsletter
"The Herald of Freedom."

Our coverage on the subject has revealed that he is
in almost daily contact with Robert E. Manuel, an attorney who
resides in Alexandria, Virginia, and who is in the law firm
of Johnson (Wayne G.) and Manuel in Fairfax, Virginia. Manuel
has claimed to have "a network" of people furnishing him
information which he in turn gives to Capell. It is apparent :
that Manuel is Capell's intermediary and he undoubtedly has oa
contacts at the Department of State and the Washington, D.C., ioe

_ Metropolitan Police Department €rém whom he is obtaining

information. ew pec dy BY. pacers toe {35>

In view of the above, it is requested that you
authorize technical coverage on Manuel's residence, 8901

located at 105 East Holbrook Avenue, Fairfax, Virginia, OF ee
on any addresses to which he may move in the futuré or ton

, : RE: JACK LEVINE

the FSI, serving from September 12, 1960, ee August 4,
1961. Since he left the FEI, he has eng
vindictive and irrational attack upon this agency and
its operations. :

In the October 20, 1962, issue of "The Nation"
magazine, Levine wrote an articls entitled "Hoover and the
Red Scare," in which he has disclosed highly classified
information relating to the ageuations of this Bureau. There

*is every indication that he intends to continue disclosing
Sensitive information. For example, Levine appeared on

New York Radio Station WBAI on the evening of Cctober is,
1962, at which time he disclosed information of a confi~

fected a@ential nature concerni nvestigations conducted by this
Bureau. The Communist rty is already aware of Levine's
actions and it is believed that members of this Party will
be in contact with him, if they have not already cone so.
Further, it is likely that representatives of the Soviet-
bioc nations will be in contact with hin seeking information,
Levine has knowledge of some of this agency's most valuabie

‘ informants. If he disclosed them, he could do this country's
.- national defense irreparable harm.

In order to adequately protect the security of
ia this country, it is requested that authority be granted to
place a technical surveillance at his current residence or
at any future address to which he may move.

Enclosed is the original of a memorandum, with

attaéhment, which reports the results of an interview of former

FBI/ Section Chief Fred J. Baumgardner by SSC Staff Members.

oy o enclosed is a copy of the memorandum, with attachment, for :
‘orwarding to Mr. James A. Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to
the President.

As you know, we have been forwarding to you numerous
memoranda reporting the results of SSC Staff interviews of
present and former FBI personnel. From time to time, we have au
noted in these reperts te us what might be considered ile
improprieties on the part of the interviewers. We have cat
submitted these reports to you without comment, choosing to “
let the facts speak for themselves insofar as the reports are -
made to us by the personnel interviewed. We are taking the
occasion of the report of the interview of Baumgardner to
call to your attention by this communication certain aspects
of the Baumgardner interview suggestive of impropriety on the
part of the interviewers,

On page two of the Baumgardner memorandum, he pointed
out that he had been asked at the outset of the interview to 7
read and sign a form entitled "Advice of Rights." After reading .,
it, Baumgardner declined to sign it and explained his reason
iA as being that the form would indicate agreement by Baumgardnar
ak that he had appeared voluntarily for interview whereas he did
not consider that his appearance was voluntary. Of significance |
, is the statement made by one of the interviewers, SSC Staff
uv ( Member Michael Epstein, that unless the form was signed by i
Aue. 0x Baumgardner, no interview would be conducted. Baumgardner |
dep. ADAd. DOXSisted in not signing the form, and notwithstanding the :

rom — threat, the interview proceeded as reported in the material = -~~

memorandum dated October 23, 1975, which has been furnished .

te you.

: Pages five and six of the Baumgardner memorandum
reported the questioning of him about Martin Luther King, Jr.
and the March on Washington. Baumgardner told the interviewers
that there had been a great deal of Communist Party activity
throughout the country in urging people to participate in the
March and that Communist Party leaders and members came to
Washington, D. G. and participated in the March. At this point
in the interview, 55C Staff Member Mark Gitenstein asked
Saumgardner why the FBI felt that 200 commmists could come

to Washington, D. C. and take over the Government. Baumgardner
replied that no one in the FBI thought that the Commmist Party~
would take over the U. S. Government during the March on
Washington. Baumgardner further told the Interviewers that he,
Baumgardner, thought that Gitenstein know that no one in the
FBE had any such idea and Baumgardner wanted to know why
Gitenstein had asked him such a question. At that point,
Gitenstein recognized that Baumgardner was quite annoyed at the
question and Gitenstein 1iumbled some half apologetic answer.

On page seven of the Baumgardner memorandum, there is
reported the questioning of him concerning one Stanley David
Levison. According to Baumgardner, Epstein desired to get into
a detailed discussion concerning Levison and his connection
with the Commmist Party. Baumgarduer replied that he declined
to be drawn inte any such discussion on the basis that it might
compromise FBI sources. Again, according to Baumgardner, Epstein
persisted in discussing the Levisen matter. As you are aware,
there has been a longstanding agreement between the SSC and this
Bureau in respect to interviews of this nature that interviewees
would not be required te answer questions when im theixy mind the
answers might be revealing of the identities of FBI confidential
sources.

The following concerns au interview by SSG Staff
Members of former FBI Section Chief Fred J. Baumgardner.

On April 23, 1975, the Louisville Field Office of the
FRI advised that it had been informed by Baumgardner that he
_ had been contacted by SSG Staf€ Member Michael Epstein who had
sought to arrange an interview of Baumgardner. Baumgardner
xequested of the FBI that a Bureau representative be present
during interview.

On April 24, 1975, Baumgardner telephonically contacted
the Legal Gounsel Division of this Bureau and related he had
been requested to come to Washington, D. C., to be interviewed by
Epstein. Baumgardner told Epstein that he would make himself
available for interview at his own office in Louisville, Kentucky.
Baumgardner expressed concern regarding the interview, pointing
out that he had been a Section Chief in the Intelligence
Division fox some 1& years and had continually dealt with very
sensitive matters which he felt were not the proper subject
matter of discussion with people outside the FBI. Additionally,
Baumgardner pointed out that he had been out of the Bureau for
/ some sight years and since he was not aware of current Bureau
py operations, he requested the Burean have a representative present

Re: Interview of Former FBI Section Chief
Fred J. Baumgardner by SSC Staff Members

As reported in the attachment to this memorandum,
negotiations between Baumgardner and the SSC apparently broke
down and it was not until late September, 1975, that negotiations
were resumed leading up to the interview which took place on
October 8, 1975.

Subsequently, this Bureau waived Baumgardner's
employment agreement as to confidentiality for the purpose of
the interview which was to concern the FBI's investigations
of Martin Luther King, Jr., Communist Influence in Racial
Movement, and his knowledge of the Security Index and related

ndices,

Attached is a memorandum prepared by Baumgardner
which reports the interview.

Enclosure

NOTE:

Legal Counsel Division contacts with Baumgardner

were by Supervisor P. V. Daly. We are including with our LHM
the one which Baumgardner had prepared through our Louisville
Office and submitted by Louisville airtel 10721/75, "Senstudy
75." The only corrections made at the Bureau in the LHM were to
alter some incorrect spellings of names and in paragraph three
of page six, the name Epstein was changed to Gitenstein after
telephonically conferring with Baumgardner.

I was first contactéd by Mike Epstein, SSC Staff
Member, in April, 1975. Tentative arrangements were made for
Epstein to come to Louisville, Kentucky, to conduct the
interview. I contacted the Bureau and was advised that a
current Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) would be made available to sit in on the interview if
I requested it. Such a request was made and the Bureau so
advised Epstein. Subsequently, Epstein called me and asked
whether I had requested someone from the Bureau to sit in i
on the interview. I replied that I had, and Epstein hung up
the phone. No furtner contact was made with me until late
in September, 1975. At that time, Martha Talley, SSC Staff
Member, called me requesting that I testify in Washington,
D. C. After I discussed this matter with the Bureau, I made
arrangements with Martha Talley to appear before Staff Members
of the Committee in Washington, D. C., on October: 8, 1975.
The next day, after these arrangements were completed, |
Martha Talley called and advised m2 that I would be testifying
under oath and that I could request to be represented by an

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

At approximately 10:00 a.m., October 8, 1975, I
was interviewed by the following named SSC Staff Members:
Mike Epstein, Mark Gitenstein, Mary De Oreo, Martha Talley,
and one other Staff Member whose name I cannot recall. Epstein
began the interview by handing me a typed sheet captioned
"Advice of Rights". He asked me’to read and sign that sheet.
After reading it, I declined to sign it. Epstein stated he
didn't understand my reluctance to sign the "Advice of Rights"
form inasmuch as the FBI always did this when they conducted
interviews. Epstein was corrected on this statement and was
told that the FBI did not reqtlire every interviewee to sign
an "Advice of Rights" statement unless the interview involved
a possible violation of the law on the part of the person
being interviewed. Thousands of interviews are conducted by
the FBI where it would be completely out of place to advise
people that statements they might make could be used against
them in a court of law. Epstein then indicated that unless
the "Advice of Rights" form was signed, no interview would be .
conducted. it replied that Ii had come tO -Washington at the
insistence of the Committee, I was present, was available and
willing to go through with the interview but I would not sign
the “Advice of Rights" form. One point in the form stated
that the interviewee had appeared voluntarily for interview.
I made the point the I had not come voluntarily but had come
only at the insistence of the Committee.

&t the beginning of the interview, Epstein handed
me two or thrée memoranda. During the course of the interview,
he let me read several other memoranda. In all, he made
available to me a total of 12 memorandums, the captions and
dates’ of which are set out as follows:

1) F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan, dated
August 22, 1963, "March on Washington".

2) ¥F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan, dated

RE:

—H_55114_ Docld:32989562 Page 127,

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Why did the FBI open a case on Martin Luther King and
the SCLC?

To the best of my recollection, some Communists were in
the headquarters of the SCLC, In addition, a secret
Communist Party member was exerting influence on King.
Since King made policy decisions for the SCLC, the FBI

had the responsibility to determine whether this important
organizaticn was being used by the Communist Party for

its own purposes. as
When and why did the Bureau change from a Communist
infiltration investigation to an effort to expose King?

We had developed information concerning King's moral conduct
which indicated a vulnerability on his part and since the
Communists were exerting influence on him, it appeared to
be in the best interest of the country from a security
standpoint. : s

Did you know a tape of activity coneerning King and others,
which took place at the Washington Hotel, was sent to

Mrs. King?

I don't recall any such incident and the first I can recall
about it was a news item which appeared a few weeks ago

in a Louisville newspaper. That item indicated that a
Special Agent of the Atlanta Office of the FBI was quoted
as saying he had made available,such a tape to Mrs. King.
Epstein said that story was wrong; the tape was sent from
Washington, D. C., by someone else. I asked him if he knew
who had taken the tape and he said he did. I asked him

for the name of the person but he refused -to give it to

me. In answer tq a question, I told Epstein I was aware

of the existence of the tape. The only discussion I could
recall concerning the use of the tape to expose King's
immoral activity was one I had with W. C. Sullivan when he
raised the question of whether it could somehow be made
public through the news media. I objected to this approach
and the matter was dropped.



u. Ss. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON_INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J.: BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS ad

-Q. Epstein asked me about a conference at the Seat of
Government with two Special Agents from the FBI Office
in Atlanta for the purpose of discussing ways to expose
King.

A

A. I didn't recall any such conference. However, Epstein
then showed me a memorandum which set out the details of
such a conference, together with a list of possible ways
in which King could be exposed.

Q. Epstein then showed me an*undated, uncaptioned page of
typing on plain bond paper. He asked me to read it.
It was a diatribe against King and was full of dirty words
and bad language. Epstein asked me if I was familiar with
it.

A, I told him I did not recall having seen it before, I
asked him where he got it. He said it came from Bureau
files. I asked him’ if he ‘knew who wrote it. He Smilingly
indicated that he did but he refused to tell me the name
of the person.

Q. Epstein asked the procedure we used in opening a Communist
infiltration case.

A. I couln't recall the exact criteria used to open such cases
but told him it would be necessary for us to have information
that the Communist Party had infiltrated an organizatian

. before we would open such a case.

Q. Epstein asked why was the FBI interested in the March on
Washington.

A. I replied that the FBI had information that Stanley
Levigony » a Communist, had consulted with King about the
march and had advised him. Further, that there was a great
deal of Communist Party activity throughout the country
in organizing and urging people to participate in the march.

In addition, Communist Party leaders and members planned
and did participate in. the »arch and actually came to
Washington, D. C. :

Q. At that point, Mark Gitenstein asked why did the FBI feel
that 200 Communists could come to Washington, D. C., and
take over the Government.

A. I replied that no one in the FBI thought the Communist
Party would take over the United States Government during
the March on Washington. _I toid him I thought he knew
that no one in the FBI had any such idea and I wanted
to know why he had asked me such a question. Mr. Gitensgtein
knew that I was quite annoyed and he mumbled some half
apologetic answer.

Q. Epstein showed me a copy of a note from Director Hoover
on a memorandum, in which the Domestic Intelligence
Division was recommending the sending of instructions to
the field to make careful checks and open Communist
infiltration cases where warranted. In effect, the
Director's note said since the Domestic Intelligence:
Division had informed him there was no material Communist
Party activity in the March on Washington, he was not
going to expend time and money on such matters.

A. I told Epstein it appeared that the Director was upset

about something but that I had no independent recollection
7 of what it was. i:

Q. Epstein asked whether there was at that time a deep
division of opinion in the Bureau with the Domestic
Intelligence Division taking the position there was no
significant Communist activity in connection with the
March on Washington and the Director taking the position
there was.

A. I replied that there was no deep division of opinion in the
Bureau on this subject to my knowledge. I made the point
that the Domestic Intelligence Division had not been
orderéd to change its mind by the Director and that in this
instance, as always, we reported factually on information.

Q. Epstin continued to refer to the Bureau's efforts to
expose King and indicated he thought we had gone rather
far when we had furnished information about King to the
Pope.

A, I replied I never thought we had furnished any information
to the Pope. Epstein then showed me a memorandum which
instructed SAC Malone of the New York Office to contact
Cardinal Cushing or Cardinal Spellman and brief them on
King iy order that they could in turn get the information A
to the Pope. This action” grew out of a trip King was i]
making to Evrope and it was thought that he would see the 7
Pope at that time. I pointed out to Epstein that although :
the memorandum in question had been sent up over my name, : if
I had in fact not seen the memorandum inasmuch as someone
had initialled it for me. He looked at the memorandum and
agreed and then asked who had initialled it. I replied
it appeared to be either James Bland or Charles Brennan.

Q. Epstein asked how the FBI knew Levison: was a Communist.

A. The FBI had reliable information that Levison. was a
secret member of the Communist Party and was advising
King on important matters involving the activities of the 1
SCLC. A

Levison and his connection with the Communist Party. i

INTERVIEW RE THE SECURITY INDEX

At 1:30 p.m. on October 8, 1975, Staff Members
John T. Elliff, Mark Gitenstein, Martha Talley, a recording
secretary whose name I didn't get, and I went to the office
of Senator Robert Morgan (NC), where I was sworn by the
Senator. The Senator appeared to be somewhat ill at ease
and commented to me that "Times change." He explained that
if he or some other Senator was not present, I would not be
required to testify under oath unless I wished to. He then
explained that he had to get back to the Capitol and he left.
The Staff Members, the recorder and I then went to the interview

I replied that I entered the service in 1939, was transferred
into the Seat of Government in 1942 or 1943, that I
supervised War Labor Disputes Act cases; that at or near

the end of World War II, I was transferred to the Internal

in that position until I retired in 1966. I called attention
to the fact that the dates were to the best of my recollection

the accurate dates.

Talley asked me to explain the origin of the Security Index.

I told her it was in operation when I first came to the
Seat of Government and I could not furnish any information
eoncerning the history of the Security index.

Elliff asked whether I approved the inclusion of names
in the Security Index.

I replied I thought I had done so. Gitenstein then remarked
something to the effect, "I think we had better show him
this memo." He was referring to a memorandum he was holding
in his hands. He then showed me the memorandum which
revealed that individual supervisors initialled forms

for including subjects' names in the Security Index. The
ease Agent's initials were countersigned by an experienced
Supervisor. I then stated that apparently I had been wrong
when I recalled that I had approved the inclusion of
subjects' names in the Security Index. They then showed

me another memorandum to the effect that I should personally
approve certain Security Index subjects before their names
could be included in the Security Index. I pointed out that i
this was what I must have had in mind when I thought I 7
had approved cases for the inclusion of the subject's name
in the Security Index.

RE:

INTERVIEW OF FORMFR SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

With respect to the memorandum which compared Department
eriteria for inclusion of subjects’ names in the Security
Index with Bureau criteria in that regard, Elliff asked
me if there was a dispute between the Department and the
Bureau concerning the criteria.

“I told Elliff I had no independent recollection of such

a dispute although there could have been one.

Talley asked why the FBI had made a list of names of United
States citir ns.

The purpose of the Security Index, to the best of my memory,
was so there would be available the names and addresses of
Communist Party members who were considered dangerous to
the internal security of the country in order that they
could be apprehended if such action became necessary during
a national emergency.

How did the FBI decide what names to put in the Security
Index?

Members of the Communist Party were included in the Security
Index but I couldn't recall other breakdowns in the Index.

How did you open Communist infiltration cases?

I couldn't recall the cfiteria but if the Communist Party
had infiltrated an organization dnd were influencing the

activities of the organization, we would open a Communist
infiltration case.

Did the FBI use the Security Index to open cases? If a
Security Index subject attend the meeting of an organization,
would a Communist infiltration case be opened?

As far as I know, the FBI did not set up the Security Index

in order to use it to open other cases. The mere attendance
of a Security Index subject at a meeting would not be

sufficient to cause ‘the FBI to open a Communist infiltration
case, As I recall it, there would have to be information
that the Communist Party had infiltrated the organization.
In addition, the aims and purposes of the organization
itself might reflect Communist influences.

“If one Security Index subject attended a meeting, would

a Communist infiltration case be opened?

It wasn't a question of one or six Security Index subjests
attending a meetin. The FBI utilized its experience in
applying the criteria we had for opening such cases.

From time to time, Gitenstein and E1liff would go off

the record for a discussion of matters of which I had no
independent recollection. I tried to make it clear that the
main thrust of the Security Index was to have available the
names and addresses of people who would be dangerous to the
internai security of the country in order that they could be
detained: in the event of a national emergency.

Q.

Talley asked if the apprehension program would be initiated
on the basis of a memorandum prepared by a Special Agent
of the FBI.

I told her that the program of apprehension would not be
initiated in that way. I explained that the FBI would
receive orders from the Attorney General in this regard.
I told her that there was a prepared set of rules called
a Portfolio which outlined the steps to be taken in order
to put the program into operation.

Elliff asked if consideration had ever been given to
putting the Security Index into operation.

I replied that on one occasion, Carl Hennrich, Assistant
to A. H. Belmont, had asked me to come to his office to
discuss putting the program into operation.

When did this occur?

I don't remember the year. 7

Q. Talley asked if any review was ever made of the Security
Index.

A. Yes. The cases were under constant review and great care
was exercised to make certain that names were deleted from
the Security incex wh 4 such action was warranted.

Near the end of the questioning, Elliff showed me
a@ memorandum dated in 1955 which Mr. Tolson had sent to the
Director. In this memorandum, Mr. Tolson commented that the
FBI had tried to get the Departmenc to review all Security
Index cases without success. He pointed out that we were
including names of people who would be apprehended in the event
the program was ever made operational. He was concerned about
this because in every other type of case, Departmental Attorneys
or United States Attorneys in the field made the determination
concerning apprehension. He feit it was a heavy burden for the
Bureau to carry this responsibility with respect to tke Security
Index. Mr. Tolson recommended that the cases, or at least
certain of them, be approved by several people including me
and Belmont (A. H. Belmont, Assistant Director).

I told Elliff I had no independent recollection of

this memorandum and could not add anything to what Mr. Tolson
had written. 7

BACKGROUND

I was first contacted by Mike Epstein, SSC Staff
Member, in April/ 1975. Tentative arrangements were made for
Epstein to come Ato Louisville, Kentucky, to conduct the
interview. I contacted the Bureau and was advised that a
current Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) would be made available to sit in on the interview if
I requested it. Such a request was made and the Bureau so
advised Epstein. Subsequently, Epstein called me and asked
whether I had requested someone from the Bureau to sit in
on the interview. I replied that I had, and Epstein hung up
the phone. No further contact was made with me until late
in September, 1975. At that time, Martha Talley, SSC Staff
Member, called me requesting that I testify in Washington,
D. C. After I discussed this matter with the Bureau, I made
arrangements with Martha Talley to appear before Staff Members
of the Committee in Washington, D. C., on October 8, 1975.
The next day, after these arrangements were completed,
Martha Talley called and advised me that I would be testifying
under oath and that I could request to be represented by an
attorney. No such request was made.

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

At approximately 10:00 a.m., October 8, 1975, I
was interviewed by the following named SSC Staff Members:
Mike Epstein, Mark Gitenstein, Mary De Oreo, Martha Talley,
and one other Staff Member whose name I cannot recall. Epstein
began the interview by handing me a typed sheet captioned
"Advice of Rights". He asked me to read and sign that sheet.
After reading it, I declined to sign it. Epstein stated he
didn't understand my reluctance to sign the "Advice of Rights"
form inasmuch as the FBI always did this when they conducted
interviews. Epstein was corrected on this statement and was
told that the FBI did not require every interviewee to sign
an "Advice of Rights" statement unless the interview involved
a possible violation of the law on the part of the person
being interviewed. Thousands of interviews are conducted by
the FBI where it would be completely out of place to advise
people that statements they might make could be used against
them in a court of law. Epstein then indicated that unless
the "Advice of Rights" form was signed, no interview would be
conducted. I replied that I had come to Washington at the
‘insistence of the Committee, I was present, was available and
willing to go through with the interview but I would not sign
the "Advice of Rights" form. One point in the form stated
that the interviewee had appeared voluntarily for interview.
I made the point the I had not come voluntarily but had come
only at the insistence of the Committee.

At the beginning of the interview, Epstein handed
me two or three memoranda. During the course of the interview,
he let me read several other memoranda. In all, he made
available to me a total of 12 memorandums, the captions and
dates of which are set out as follows:

1) F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan, dated
August 22, 1963, "March on Washington".

2) ¥F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan, dated
August 29, 1963, "March on Washington".

The questions posed to me by the Staff Members
revolvéd around the information which appeared in the above
listed memoranda. I took no notes of the questioning and
cannot set forth the questions and answers in the order in
which they were asked. However, I will set out as many of
the questions, together with my answers, as I can recall.
Practically all of the questions were asked by Mike Epstein.

I am unable to quote the exact questions and my exact answers;
however, I will set out the gist of the questions and my
answers as best I can recall them.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

-Q. Why did the FBI open a case on Martin Luther King and
the SCLC?

A. To the best of my recollection, some Communists were in
the headquarters of the SCLC. In addition, a secret
Communist Party member was exerting influence on King.
Since King made policy decisions for the SCLC, the FBI
had the responsibility to determine whether this important
organization was being used by the Communist Party for
its own purposes.

Q. When and why did the Bureau change from a Communist
infiltration investigation to an effort to expose King?

A. We had developed information concerning King's moval conduct
which indicated a vulnerability on his part and since the
Communists were exerting influence on him, it appeared to
be in the best interest of the country from a security
standpoint.

Q. Did you know a tape of activity concerning King and others,
which took place at the Washington Hotel, was sent to
Mrs. King?

A. I don't recall any such incident and the first I can recall
about it was a news item which appeared a few weeks ago
in a Louisville newspaper. That item indicated that a
Special Agent of the Atlanta Office of the FBI was quoted
as saying he had made available such a tape to Mrs. King.
Epstein said that story was wrong; the tape was sent from
Washington, D. C., by someone else. I asked him if he knew
who had taken the tape and he said he did. I asked him
for the name of the person but he refused to’ give it to
me. In answer to a question, I told Epstein I was aware
of the existence of the tape. The only discussion I could
recall concerning the use of the tape to expose King's
immoral activity was one I had with W. C. Sullivan when he
raised the question of whether it could somehow be made
public through the news media. I objected to this approach
and the matter was dropped.

FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. Epstein asked me about a conference at the Seat of
Government with two Special Agents from the FBI Office
in Atlanta for the purpose of discussing ways to expose
King.

A. I didn't recall any such conferences. However, Epstein
then showed me a memorandum which set out the details of
such a conference, together with a list of possible ways
in which King could be exposed.

Q. Epstein then showed me an undated, uncaptioned page of
typing on plain bond paper. He asked me to read it.
It was a diatribe against King and was full of dirty words
and bad language. Epstein asked me if I was familiar with
it.

A. I told him I did not recall having seen it before. I
asked him where he got it. He said it came from Bureau
files. I asked him if he knew who wrote it. He smilingly
indicated that he did but he refused to tell me the name
of the person.

Q. Epstein asked the procedure we used in opening a Communist
infiltration case.

A. I couln't recall the exact criteria used to open such cases
but told him it would be necessary for us to have information
that the Communist Party had infiltrated an organization
before we would open such a case.

Q. Epstein asked why was the FBI interested in the March on
Washington.

phied that the FBI had information that Stanley

] Ley, on, a Communist, had consulted with King about the
and had advised him. Further, that there was a great

déal of Communist Party activity throughout the country

in organizing and urging people to participate in the march.

In addition, Communist Party leaders and members planned
and did participate in the march and actually came to
Washington, D. C.

Q. At that point, Mark Gitenstein asked why did the FBI feel
that 200 Communists could come to Washington, D. c., and
take over the Government.

I replied that no one in the FBI thought the Communist

Party would take over the United States Government during

the March on Washington. I told him I thought he knew

that no one in the FBI had any such idea and I manne’ Guze yeu!
to know why he had asked me such a question. Mr. pst Ager Wey,
knew that I was quite annoyed and he mumbled some half

apologetic answer.

Q. Epstein showed me a copy of a note from Director Hoover
on a memorandum, in which the Domestic Intelligence
Division was recommending the sending of instructions to
the field to make careful checks and open Communist
infiltration cases where warranted. In effect, the
Director's note said since the Domestic Intelligence
Division had informed him there was no material Communist
Party activity in the March on Washington, he was not
going to expend time and money on such matters.

about something but that I had no independent recollection
of what it was.

Q. Epstein asked whether there was at that time a deep
division of opinion in the Bureau with the Domestic
Intelligence Division taking7‘the position there was no
significant Communist activity in connection with the
March on Washington and the Director taking the position
there was.

A, I replied that there was no deep division of opinion in the
Bureau on this subject to my knowledge. I made the point
that the Domestic Intelligence Division had not been
ordered to change its mind by the Director and that in this
instance, as always, we reported factually on information
developed.

} record the "Advice of Rights". She did not ask me to sign the
"Advice of Rights". When she had finished reading, I put into
the record an objection concerning the statement that I was
voluntarily before the Committee. I wanted the record to
clearly show that I was appearing at the insistence of the
Committee. E11liff commented he couldn't see what difference
it made. I told him it made a difference to me.

Q. Talley asked me to detail my Bureau career.

RE:

8. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

I replied that I entered the service in 1939, was transferred
into the Seat of Government in 1942 or 1943, that I

supervised War Labor Disputes Act cases; that at or near

the end of World War II, I was transferred to the Internal
Security Section. In 1946 or 1947, I was promoted to the
position of Number 1 Man in that section. In 1948 or 1949,

I was made Chief of the Internal Security Section and remained
in that position until I retired in 1966. I called attention
to the fact that the dates were to the best of my recollection
but that my service record would speak for itself concerning
the accurate dates.

Talley asked me to explain the origin of the Security Index.

I told her it was in operation when I first came to the
Seat of Government and I could not furnish any information
concerning the history of the Security Index.

Elliff asked whether I approved the inclusion of names
in the Security Index.

I replied I thought I had done so. Gitenstein then remarked
something to the effect, "I think we had better show him
this memo." He was referring to a memorandum he was holding
in his hands. He then showed me the memorandum which
revealed that individual supervisors initialled forms

for including subjects' names in the Security Index. The
case Agent's initials were countersigned by an experienced
Supervisor. I then stated that apparently I had been wrong
when I recalled that I had approved the inclusion of
subjects' names in the Security Index. They then showed

me another memorandum to the effect that I should personally
approve certain Security Index subjects before their names
could be incduded in the Security Index. I pointed out that
this was what I must have had in mind when I thought I

had approved cases for the inclusion of the subject's name
in the Security Index.

ON _INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. With respect to the memorandum which compared Department
criteria for inclusion of subjects' names in the Security
Index with Bureau criteria in that regard, Elliff asked
me if there was a dispute between the Department and the
Bureau concerning the criteria.

A. I told Elliff I had no independent recollection of such
a dispute although there could have been one.

Q. Talley asked why the FBI had made a list of names of United
States citizens.

A. The purpose of the Security Index, to the best of my memory,
was so there would be available the names and addresses of
Communist Party members who were considered dangerous to
the internal security of the country in order that they
could be apprehended if such action became necessary during
a national emergency.

Q. How did the FBI decide what names to put. in the Security
Index?

A. Members of the Communist Party were included in the Security
Index but I couldn't recall other breakdowns in the Index.

Q. How did you open Communist infiltration cases?

A. I couldn't recall the ctiteria but if the Communist Party
had infiltrated an organization and were influencing the
activities of the organization, we would open a Communist
infiltration case.

- Q. Did the FBI use the Security Index to open cases? If a-

Security Index subject attend the meeting of an organization,
would a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A. As far as I know, the FBI did not set up the Security Index
in order to use it to open other cases. The mere attendance
of a Security Index subject at a meeting would hot be

sufficient to cause the FBI to open a Communist infiltration
case. As I recall it, there would have to be information
that the Communist Party had infiltrated the organization.
In addition, the aims and purposes of the organization
itself might reflect Communist influences.

Q. If one Security Index subject attended a meeting, would
a Communist infiltration case be opened?

A. It wasn't a question of one or six Security Index subjects
attending a meeting. The FBI utilized its experience in
applying the criteria we had for opening such cases.

From time to time, Gitenstein and El1liff would go off
the record for a discussion of matters of which I had no
independent recollection. I tried to make it clear that the
main thrust of the Security Index was to have available the
names and addresses of people who would be dangerous to the
internal security of the country in order that they could be
detained in the event of a national emergency.

Q. Talley asked if the apprehension program would be initiated
on the basis of a memorandum prepared by a Special Agent
of the FBI.

A. I told her that the program of apprehension would not be
initiated in that way. I explained that the FBI would
receive orders from the Attorney General in this regard.
I told her that there was a prepared set of rules called
a Portfolio which outlined the steps to be taken in order
to put the program into operation.

Q. Elliff asked if consideration had ever been given to
putting the Security Index into operation.

A. I replied that on one occasion, cart fifnrien, Assistant
to A. H. Belmont, had asked me to come\tO his office to
discuss putting the program into operation.

Q. When did this occur?

I don't remember the year.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER SECTION CHIEF
FRED J. BAUMGARDNER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Q. Talley asked if any review was ever made of the Security
Index.

A. Yes. The cases were under constant review and great care
was exercised to make certain that names were deleted from
the Security Index when such action was warranted.

Near the end of the questioning, Elliff showed me
a memorandum dated in 1955 which Mr. Tolson had sent to the
Director. In this memorandum, Mr. Tolson commented that the
FBI had tried to get the Department to review all Security
Index cases without success. He pointed out that we were
including names of people who would be apprehended in the event
the program was ever made operational. He was concerned about
this because in every other type of case, Departmental Attorneys
or United States Attorneys in the field made the determination
concerning apprehension. He felt it was a heavy burden for the
Bureau to carry this responsibility with respect to the Security
Index. Mr. Tolson recommended that the cases, or at least
certain of them, be approved by several people including me
and Belmont (A. H. Belmont, Assistant Director).

I told E1liff I had no independent recollection of

this memorandum and could not add anything to what Mr. Tolson
had written.
