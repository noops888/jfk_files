Dear tro Houston and Mr. Oakley:

Following up

on iny previous

letter on suggested WORLD CENTERS OF HUNAN RIGHTS;

I. should like to submit the following to:

accelerate the fornulation of a program anent WORLD'

HASEAS CORPUS and the WORLD CENTERS: FOR HUMAN

RIGUTS.

Arent our

purposeful talks in Washington [with Ar. OAKLEYl

with reference to the many problems of Human Rights,

as promised by. the UNITED NATIONS CHARTER: and the

UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUNLY RIGHTS, there is

great need for dynamic private, foundation support

for world regional studies and discussions to focus

public attention on some of the concrete issues 32

relating

to the rights of man and the ligament of

law to inplement these rights.

It is

heartebing to note such endeavors as the INTERNATIONAL

COFFENCE ON MUT RIGHTS In TERRIN,

, Because buttressed

knowledge must precede and accompany mants efforts

in sing technolosy to advance lumn freedom, it is

essential the: the

best minds üe put to work in

cranining the impact of technology of Human Freedom

in a new age:

There are mary

rogions of the world where luman Rights are merely

abstractions,

and without meaning.

These are the

NILLIONS,

and probably Tho BILLios,of persons

who have seen no chango affecring their welfare

ircedom as a result of the well-intentioned expressions

UNITED NATIONS CHARTER aud the UNIVERSAL

DECLARATION OF HUAN RIGHTS

Within the

franevork of MORLO HABEAS CORPUS,

the individual rights

to which all men are entitled must become in fact

individual.

The threats of the new technolosicat

and political changes must become the ney promise for

individual freedom"

within the realistic Rule: or Law

can guarantee to correct ane prevent wrongius

detention:

In addition to

the rights

of political freedon, we austrinsure. the

right to health, the right to econonic well being,

the right: to education.
