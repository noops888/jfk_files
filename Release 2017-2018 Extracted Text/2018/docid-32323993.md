SAMUEL MO GIANCANA, AKAO, ARO DAILY SUMMARY

CG SIX FOUR NINE EIGHT DASH PC ADVISED THIS DATE THAT

IN RECENT CONTACTS WITH PERSONS CLOSE TO SAM GIANCANA HE

HAS LEARNED THAT A GENERAL FEELING OF APPREHENSIVENESS

PERVADES THE GIANCANA ORGANIZATION. FEW REMARKS ARE BEING

MADE BY ANY OF THESE PERSONS AS TO THEIR OPINIONS REGARDING

WHAT GIANCANA PLANS TO DO IN THE FUTURE IN REGARD TO THE

RUNNING OF THE CHICAGO CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. THIS INFORMANT

ADVISES THAT GIANCANA IS GIVING NO DIRECTIONS TO HIS

Master

UNDERLINGS AND AS A RESULT THE GENERAL SITUATION IS IN A

STATE OF CHAOS. IT IS POINTED OUT THAT ADDING TO THIS

GENERAL STATE OF CONFUSION GIANCANA HAS ABSENTED HIMSELF

FROM THE CHICAGO AREA FOR THE PAST

Tw

EX

464KS

AND APPARENTLY

HAS GIVEN NO INDICATION AS TO WHEN

REC- 60

HE WILL RETURN.

MANY OF CHICAGO-S HOODLUMS, THAT GIANCANA-S DEPARTURE

WAS CAUSED BY A FEAR THAT THE FBI WOULD REINSTITUTE THE

SURVEILLANCE UPON HIS DAILY ACTIVITIES AND WOULD AGAIN

LEAVE HIM IN A POSITION WHERE HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO GO

BOUT HIS DAILY ACTIVITIES IN AN UNHAMPERED ANNER.

i" t

"Lon+T TeXASE 4002400074037040595

ACCORDING TO MC DONALD, GIANCANA, IN CONVERSATION WITH

OTHER HOODLUMS, HAS INDICATED THAT HE IS CONSIDERING

LEAVING THE COUNTRY WITH A POSSIBLE DESTINATION BEING

BRAZIL. THE CHICAGO DIVISION FEELS THAT THIS INFORMATION

HAS SOME MERIT BASED ON THE COMMENTS OF MURRAY HUMPHREYS

MADE IN THE PAST THAT GIANCANA SHOULD ATTEMPT TO DO

EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO GET AWAY FROM THE FBI SURVEILLANCE

AND TO REMAIN IN SOME LOCATION WHERE SUCH SURVEILLANCE

COULD NOT BE REINSTITUTED. IT IS FELT THAT A STRONG

POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT A RECENT MEETING HELD AT STALEYS

RESTAURANT BY NINE OF CHICAGO-S LEADING HOODLUMS WAS

PROBABLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DECIDING HOW GIANCANA SHOULD

GOVERN HIMSELF BASED ON CURRENT HAPPENINGS. IT IS FURTHER

WAS RECOMMENDED TO GIANCAN

"THAT HE LEAVE CHICAGO. U

MC DONALD CONTINUED THAT BECAUSE OF RECENT PUBLICITY

ATTENDENT UPON THE HOODLUM SITUATION IN CHICAGO MARSHALL

CAIFANO IS ALSO MAKING PLANS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY. MC DONALD

ADVISED THAT ASIDE FROM THE GENERAL CONSTERNATION CAUSED BY

THE GIANCANA SITUATION IT HAS BEEN LEARNED BY THE HOODLUMS

THAT INTERNAL REVENUE IS REPORTEDLY GOING TO INDICT THREE

CHICAGO HOODLUMS SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE END OF THIS YEAR.

ATHE NAMES OF THESE HOODLUMS ARE UNKNOWN THEREBY CAUSING

A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIETY AMONG AT LEAST A HALF A DOZEN OF

THE LEADING HOODLUMS. U
