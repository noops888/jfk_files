we [

When Hestor Sanches wont to seo AMLASH-] in Paris recantly, I asked hin

to get IASH?s comments on Fidelts habits, mind, et cetera. IASH said that Fidel
is anything but "crazy" - far to the contrary. TASH could eite no examples of
"public peculiarities", For some months pricr to LASHts departure for Europe in
mid-Novenber 1964, Fidel had been taking very good care of himself. Ee has
almost stopped drinking - he now drinks very little indeed. He no longer eate
as he used to - an enortous meal, simply enormous - and then perhaps nothing
for 24 hours. He eats a reasonable ancunt now, and with more normal frequency.
In addition, he is taking exoroives steedily. He also goes to the beach at
Varadero every weekend, to swim and skin dive, which he is very fomi of.
